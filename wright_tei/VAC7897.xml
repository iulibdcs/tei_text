LIPPINCOTT &amp; CO. 1872.  &#xD;<pb n="-5" xml:id="VAC7897-00000003"/> Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1871, by J. B. LIPPINCOTT     &amp; CO., In the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.   ' LEFT TO HERSELF. CHAPT'ER    I. THERE lived, on the outskirts of a large village among the mountains of Virginia, a family named Lockhart. It was a good old family, having had a grandfather,-a blessing which even in the land of F. F. V.'s some poor wretches must dispense with. To this good old family, which could "hold up its head and tell its name," there now belonged four mem- bers: Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart, Florence their daughter, and somebody's nephew,-the grandfather's, perhaps, John Lockhart, recently ordained for the ministry. Mr. Lockhart was a small, thin man, more or less irrita- ble and eccentric according to the amount of tobacco con- sumed per diem, but shrewd, warm-hearted, and generous. His wife was dying from want of fresh air, sunlight, exercise, and judicious dressing. You may see women kill themselves so almost any day; their friends call them consumptive. She was one of the best women in the world; loved God and most of her neighbors, told the truth, gave to the poor, studied the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of Matthew, educating her child accordingly, and would have converted her husband, but found tobacco as the parent of dyspepsia too powerful an opponent. In short, the only accusation likely to be brought against (5)  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7897-00000004"/> 6       L LEFT TO HERSELF. her at the day of judgment is, that she committed suicide; a habit which greatly obtains among American women, more particularly those of the South. Florence was lovely and lovable; but it had required careful discipline to keep under subjection the pride and temper that seemed inherent in the blood. Like most of her name, she had more feeling than judgment; more pride than prudence; being quicker to resent than to re- flect, and more ready to forgive than to forget. John not being fond of society, we will postpone his introduction. One afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart were sitting on the piazza, looking at the sun, as dying he disinherited mountain and river, withdrawing from them the wealth of glorious light in which they had reveled all the long summer day. "Where is Florence?" asked her father. "Gone walking with Mr. Muncair, I believe," said his wife. "Humph I When is the fellow going home? I wish he would go at once. Yellow Jack might take a fancy to him. I can't." "Oh, Mr. Lockhart I I think him one of the most agree- able and entertaining of men ; so handsome too." "No decision of character," asserted the gentleman. "Intent on pleasing himself. Careless of other people's -feelings. Gay and agreeable because it requires no self- denial so long as he has good health and plenty of money." "Perhaps be is a little thoughtless occasionally; but-- "Bah! don't talk to me about a man being thoughtless I If he is your friend, give :him credit for having sense enough to be vicious. What right has a man to be thoughtless? If he doesn't think for himself, somebody   LEFT TO HERSELF.  has to think for him; and if he suffers from his thought- lessness, he never suffers alone. You always find thought- less people thoughtful enough, when they are going down, to catch hold of somebody who has thought how to keep up. If a man is vicious, you can guard against him; you can form some idea of what he will do under given circumstances; but thoughtless! And ten to one he will, with the best possible intentions, do you the worst possible injury; know of a pitfall in your path, yet never tell you till reminded by seeing you pitch in head fore- most I Trust him, and, without desiring to wound, he betrays you. Reproach him, and ' he didn't think' this, that, or the other. Fudge I What are a man's brains for, if not to think with?" "Oh, well," said Mrs. Lockhart, "he will soon re. lieve you of his presence. For the last three weeks he has been intending to leave. Really, Mr. Muncair would not feel flattered '" "I don't want Muncair to feel flattered I I don't care a dime whether Muncair feels flattered or not I A thought- less man is a selfish man; he is an unreliable man; to a great extent he is a treacherous man. He does more harm without absolutely intending it, than he would ever have the wit to do ma'iciously. Going, is he? Procras- tinating, too. A thoughtless man always procrastinates, except in some matter productive of pleasure to him- self and confusion to everybody else; then bet your life he is prompt enough." "Here they come," said Mrs. Lockhart, in reply; and, raising his eyes, her husband saw, slowly approaching, Florence and Frank Muncair. He was, as Mrs. Lockhart had said, a handsome man; and as her husband looked at him coming up. the walk, he almost repented the severity of his criticism. Those'  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7897-00000005"/> 8       LEFT TO HERSELF. eyes surely looked you too squarely in the face to belong to a treacherous man; those muscles certainly appeared too well developed for you to dare to call him such. Frank Muncair had all his life been attended by curses in disguise. One which had awaited him at his birth and attended him from his cradle, was wealth in the hands of foolishy indulgent parents. Another was indiscriminate praise, lavished on the boy, the youth, and the man; whis- pered by his friends; buzzed into the ears of his easily flattered parents; re-echoed in his presence; until be almost believed exertion unnecessary for one of his " ver- satile talents," " easy manners," " fine address," " polished education," "handsome person," and, it might have been added, ' large fortune." But sometimles imlpulse would urge to better things: Talent, drugged with the "poppy and mandragora" of voluble flattery, would rouse herself, and ask, A"Where am I?"Energy would determine to be free; and Ambition gird herself for the race. Then some object would be pursued with the zeal and power of a man. But at his birth a fatal omission had been made when the gift, the genius, of perseverance was withheld; and Frank Muncair became fickle as Fortune herself, suddenly abandoning what he had most eagerly sought, standing idle within sight of the goal, wearying of the field as Success began to unfurl her banner. Thus, his budded schemes failed to bear fruit, often to blossom; and, so far, he had lost not a day, but a lifetime. "Mrs. Lockhart," said Frank, seating himself on the steps at her feet, "you should have been in Dr. Thorn- ton's office to-day. .He and I had been out about an hour, and were returning, when Joe, the dusky guardian angel of Thornton's bottles, bones, and scalpels, rushed to meet us. ' Mas' Jack I' he exclaimed.   LEFT TO HERSELF.         9 "' Well?' said Thornton. "' They come for you to go somewhar in a mighty hurry.' "Thornton's boots felt the thrill that ran through their master's frame, and came near running away with him from pure sympathy. "' A man is done gone an' killed hisself, sar P' "' Who is the man?' "' I dunno, sar,' said Joe, breathlessly. "' Where is he?' "' Dunno, sar.' (Joe somewhat recovered; enough so to back slowly toward the door.) "' You don't know?' 'No, sar.' (With his hand on the knob.) "' Where did they say I must go?' "' I dunno, sar.' Joe's voice now proceeded from out- side the door. "You should have seen Thornton, and heard him I "You don't know 1 oh, you don't know, don't you?' "'Mas' Jack --please, Mas' Jack!I -I--I gwine tell de blessed trufe. I warn't in de office, an'-an' dey left word wid Aleck, an' Aleck he's so no 'count he went an'? forgot.' "' Where were you, sir?' asked Thornton. "' Hoh, my dear, splendid Mas' Jack l--please, sir, I warn't nowhar, sir.' "Jack turned to me: ' Muncair, if you would like to witness a surgical operation you can now do so. Come in, Joe. Take that seat.' Joe sat on the extreme edge of the chair indicated, while his master opened a case of surgical instruments. At sight of them Joe bounded from-his seat, and, on being commanded to resume it, de- clared that ' it warn't noways 'spectful-like for him to be a settin' down when rale gen'lelmeq was stannin';' but his polite scruples being summarily disposed of, he was,  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7897-00000006"/> 10 .      LEFT TO HERSELF. compelled to sit down again. Carefully placing the in- struments on a table at Joe's elbow, Thornton said, 'There is on record a case of amputation in which one Joseph, familiarly denominated Joe, deprived himself of that valuable extremity known as the great or big toe, historical evidence going to prove that 'Joe cut off his biggest toe, And hung it up to dry.' The operation which I shall now perform upon this more modern Joseph or Joe is not without the shadow of a precedent; but,'-turning suddenly to Joe,-' in case you should not understand all this, I distinctly inform you that I am about to cut off your legs (Joe's eyelids disap- peared entirely, leaving an expanse, of glistening balD; so roll up your pantaloons.' Joe yelled, and grasped the bottoms of his pantaloons, as if afraid they would roll up of their own accord. "' Roll them up, or I'll cut your throat 1' said Thornton. Joe turned them back about half an inch. "' Above the knee i' shouted his master, ' or I'll have vour ears off Now the other side.' "Joe's yells grew terrific: ' Please, Mas' Jack I I 'clar to gracious--' But he felt the blade, his eyes closed, and he gave himself up for lost; whereupon Thornton whispered me to beg him off; and, my intercession being graciously received, Joe was released, with this parting injunction from Jack: "' And remember, now, that if ever you employ those remarkable-looking members to leave this office without permission, it will be my duty to remove you finally from the -path of temptation. Here endeth the first lesson.'" "He is a great scamp, that Joe," said Mr. Lockhart, "As I came from the post-office-by the way, Florence,   LEFT TO HERSELF.        " here is a letter for you-I saw him with Thornton's eye-glass and slippers on, talking to another little villain about his own age. 'Now,' he was saying, 'I'll be Mas' Jack, an' go to church, an' when the people is 'bout klected an' settin' down so they can look about easy, you come for me in a awful hurry, an' make all the fuss you kin, an' then I'll come out on my tiptoes, like I didn't want to 'sturb nobody, an' then, when we git back to the office, I'll kick you like de debble.' "'Lor' I How come you gwine kick me an' you done tole me yourself?' "'Go 'long, boy i Mas' Jack he do it so nat'l, he 'seeve hisself, much less the Passon. By time he let down his heels, he ready to swar I fooled him. But I ain't keerin'; 'cos when he git over his mad, he gimme fo'pence or ninepence, 'cordin' to bow I hollered, an' lemme go to fishin'.' Is your letter from Charles?" "Yes, sir. He says they will be in New Orleans about the first of November." Mr. Lockhart entered the house, and his wife followed, saying to Florence, -. "Don't sit here long, child; the dew begins to fall." "What Charles is that?" asked Mr. Muncair. "My cousin, Charles Shelley. New Orleans is his home, as well as yours," said Florence. "Oh, yes, I think I have seen him. Your cousin, is he? Do you know him well?"           ? "Yes; almost as well as I love him." "Happy fellow I I understood that you had never been South till last winter was I mistaken?" "No; but Charhe was educated in Virginia, and- perhaps in New Orleans you know, or have heard of, a Mr. Guy Shelley, of the firm of Shelley, Munro &amp; Co.?" "Yes."   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7897-00000007"/> 12   '   LEFT TO HERSELF. "This Mr. Guy Shelley is my father's half-brother, and Charlie's father. Ever so many years ago, away down deep in the olden time, he and my father had a difficulty, and, as they never abuse each other, I conclude there is no hope of a reconciliation. When Mrs. Shelley died, mother offered to take charge of the children, but Uncle Guy declined imposing on her kindness; and we have seen only Charlie, who was for several years a pupil at the Lorburg Institute, and spent all his leisure time with us. He has now gone to France for Edith, his sister, who, on the death of her mnother, was sent to New York to be educated with the daughters of Mrs. Thornton, a relative of Uncle Guy, and subsequently to France to receive the final polish. Aunt Rosahe had desired that at her death Madame -Vansi should take charge of Edith, but Uncle Guy would not consent that she should receive a solely foreign education, and did not permit her to go to France till within the last four years." "Who is Madame Vansi?" "A French widow who was on a visit to New Orleans, and with whom Aunt Rosalie became very intimate. She had inherited property in New Orleans, but the blaim was disputed, or something was the matter; I hardly 'know what. At any rate, Uncle Guy was very kind, Madame Vansi very grateful, and Aunt Rosalie very desirous that Edith should receive a Parisian education. How glad she must be to come home, having nearly all her life been at boarding,-school l" "Pardon me if I say that your cousin is probably fitted neither to enjoy nor to adorn what you or I think of as ' home.' What can she know of home, whose life has been passed in the worse than barren waste of a French boarding-school, with its petty intrigues, its en- ' vies and jealousies, its want of good works or genuine   LEFT TO HERSELF.     Je  t faith, and its cringing observance of religious forms? How can she know what woman should be, when the ideas she has imbibed are those of a schoolmistress, whose only thought is, to seem; whose only ambition, to shine?" i Ah, but false fire glows only in the dark. The light of Edith's own intellect would divest of all radiance a character such as that you portray. She would not be attracted or influenced by such a woman, and in fact may not have been thrown with such. You cannot know, nor do I." Frank laughed incredulously: "Your cousin may have been a very smart child, and may be a highly intellectual woman, but she can hardly have withstood the influ- ence of those under whose control she has always lived. And now, as you insist upon it, you may read me Charlie's letter." "I will read you what he says of Edith, as it will be gratifying to you to know that your views are not without foundation: ' Florence, you and Edith must be friends; at anv rate, neither can help admiring the o ther. But, without meaning to offend your amour-propre, cousin mine, I must say that my sister is the loveliest woman I ever saw,--lovely in person, mind, and character; havin only one defect, but that a terrible one: she has no ideS of religion. Madame Vansi pretends to be a Roioan Catholic, but her life is a slander on that faith, and Ejigth has mind enough to be so disgusted by her weak hypoc- risy that she lends a willing ear to father's mockinO-at all religion: so you see this great misfortune is hadfly her fault. However, you, who have never been exposed to evil influences, must teach my beautiful sister the lessons your good mother has sought to impress upon you. Everything else, beauty, refinement, intelligence, accom- plishments, she has in abundance. I forgot to tell you, 2  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7897-00000008"/> "      LEFT TO HERSELF. that her voice is a marvel,-she should have been born in Italy; but you will be tired of hearing of her, so good- night.'" Florence instantly regretted having read this aloud, as-it would produce an unfavorable impression concerning Edith, and she was much too generous to desire any- thing of the kind; but if mischief there were, it had been already done; she could not now make atonement. "Poor thing I Poor girl!"Frank was saying. "An in- fidel for a father, a schoolmistress for a mother, and a French capping of the climax I I had as soon wear a nettle on my lapel as marry such a woman. She may be brilliant, she cannot be lovable." "You mistake," said Florence. "Charlie is extrava- gantly fond of her; and, judging from the letters he re- ceived from her while at school, she loves him most dearly. You are too easily prejudiced. They leave Paris soon, and, on your return home, you will have oppor- tunities of learning whether she is lovable. You will, no doubt, meet her often, and--wear the nettle, perhaps." "Not if a Virginia rose will rest its dainty head upon my bosom." "There is the tea-bell," said Florence. And with some precipitation she led the way into the house.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        15 CHAPTER II. MADAME RONCOURT stepped into her carriage, and, ordering the coachman to drive to Madame Tansi's, tapped impatiently on her porte-monnaie, now and then interrupting herself to bow to those with whom she was acquainted, among the many who thronged the streets of Paris on that sunny autumn morning. The carriage stopped, and, as the footman sprang from his place, a gentleman issuing from the house was ac- costed by Madame Roncourt: "Good-morning, signor. Your last lesson, I suppose?" "Yes, yes," was the disconsolate reply. "Miss Shelley was my best pupil, and has the voice of an angel, yet leaves Paris to bury herself in-bah!-in America!" With a shrug of disgust, he touched his hat and was off, leaving Madame Roncourt to laugh at his earnest- ness, while she waited for Edith, with whom she had a shopping engagement. "Excuse me," said that young lady, when she pres- ently appeared,-"excuse me for having detained you, but Signor Vaselli was so lengthy in his farewell, and so affecting in the expression of his timid hopes for my happiness and safety among the barbarians my country- people, that gratitude required me to shed a few tears. You will not be surprised that I embraced the occasion to shed an additional number in view of my own feeling on the subject. But let us pause here. I must console myself with something handsome in the way of jewelry." "Which you can do at Samper's, if anywhere," said Madame Roncourt. And they entered the establishment.,  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7897-00000009"/> JLV       u t-^jL-A' JL \^ A Lf " 1.Da  UL'a" The proprietor, to whom both ladies were well known, presently appeared, and, after directing attention to some of the handsomest among the articles already exhibited by his salesman, said, "But allow me to show you some- thing which, by its extreme beauty, will commend itself to the taste of you ladies, though you will question its utility." And he unsheathed for their inspection a slen- der poniard, the hilt studded with garnets, and, lying among the jewels, an emerald -serpent with diamond eyes. Was the blade so cold, that its touch made Edith Shelley shiver in the autumni sunlight? The Arabs have a superstition that at the moment when such a chill passes over you, God is decreeing the hour of your death, or that of some one dear to you. "Monsieur," said Madame Roncourt, "if ever I deter- mine to commit suicide, may I beg the favor of a loan?" And she playfully pointed the dagger toward her heart. "My poniard would then be immortalized, madame," he replied, with a bow; " but I should be deservedly exe- crated by all Paris. There is, however, a legend full of horror connected with the little weapon." And he re- related it. "What is the price of it?" asked Edith. "Five hundred francs." "I will take it, monsieur." "To protect yourself among the savages over the water?"Laughing carelessly, Madame Roncourt re-en- tered her carriage and was whirled away to her milliner's. In the evening, Edith exhibited to Charles and one or two others her tlorning's purchase; relating also its history as given by the jeweler. "Is it possible you let Samnper palm off that story on you?" exclaimed Madame Vansi. "And what, in the name of various things, do you want o   "E'T TO HERSELF.        17 with it? Why did you not get a paper of strychnine,-or a bottle of laudanum, or a parlor-pistol (to spare your nerves), or a yard or two of rope? All together would not have cost as much as this, and would have been quite as much to the purpose, I imagine.". "Oh, because, for myself, I should prefer a handsome poniard, as being a more romantic and aristocratic means 5 of forcing a passage into the next world; --common people use those other things ;- and when I open the way for any one else, I do not mean to insult as well as injure my victim." "Die!" said Charlie. Throwing his arm around her, he lifted the dagger, and looked into her face with a frowning brow and compressed but smiling lips. It was a hand- some tableau, as Edith threw herself back with drooping head and arms, simulating the death which it might almost have seemed would never dare approach that Hebe form and bright young face, all aglow in the pride of health and happiness. "My arm is not so mighty as thy weight, oh, sister mine then live --and living, rise 1" said Charles. "Ah, no!-thou bad'st me die; and o'er my loving heart didst lift thy weapon; yet-yet than such behest from lips so dear, what need for keener bladef. Ah, could but my young life be trafficked for a jest, gladly would I dissolve it in thy pleasure-cup, that, drinking, thou mightst smile!" With lips parted in a mischievous smile, but eyes ob- stinately closed, she preserved his attitude, till Charles threatened to withdraw his support, when, turning to a gentleman present, she asked, "Will it not be an elegant addition to some costume for a fancy ball?" "Let me see it in my hand, as children say. It is in- deed handsome; but what a villainous countenance yout 2* A  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7897-00000010"/> 18       LEFT TO HERSELF. serpent has! Here are covetousness, envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness." "Yes," said Charles. "-The garnets are bleeding hearts; the emerald serpent is a type of jealousy; his diamond eyes glitter with the light of hate,-or--" The door was thrown open, and visitors were an- nounced. In lieu of a tedious description of the journey from Paris to New Orleans, let us 4ive the reader some ac- count of the Shelley family. A heart-sick, hopeless, disappointed man was Guy Shelley,-one for whom no "Future had its heaven," no "Past its long ago."  Married to a woman who cared little to conceal the fact that she had accepted him for his broad acres and many slaves; too proud to attempt to win as a husband the heart which had been withheld from the lover; despising the want of principle which had led her to become his wife, and scorning to "play one scene Of excellent dissembling, and let it look Like perfect honor;" he withdrew himself almost totally from her society, lav- ishing on her, however, with no niggard hand, the wealth for which she had sold herself. At length were raised two little mounds, beneath which lay the children of Guy and Rosalie Shelley, and with whom seemed to fade the slight gleam of hope and ten- derness that disappointment had left alight in their father's heart. He had been a sad and grave, but tender father, and now his wife might have won back the love of which, in its hour of desolation, her woman's heart so sorely felt the need; but she heard his measured tread in the room   LEFT TO .HERSELF.        - 19 above, and had no heart to go to him and say, as her feel- ings prompted, "Guy, they were ours; let us weep to- gether." Even when they met, the stony look of pent-up grief in his eyes awed and terrified her as much as the intrusion of her voluble sorrow displeased and disgusted him. Thus the breach widened, and thus the desolate man grew stern and harsh; and if, in the stillness, he sometimes seemed to hear sweet, childish voices, and the pattering of little feet, or to feel upon his cheek and brow the wayward wandering of a tiny hand, he choked back- the great sob rising in his throat, and, grow. ing sterner still, sought to live all within himself. Thus, too, his irritability increased to harshness; his reserve to repulsiveness; his dignity to hauteur; his sarcasm to bitterness; and, his faith in woman gone, the germ of skepticism planted in his nature struck its roots deep into his heart. They had two more children,-Charles and Edith ; but for Mr. Shelley "the tender grace of a day that was dead" could never come back again, and on them be never lavished the affection which had centred on those he had loved first, and lost. Finally, because of a difficulty between himself and his half-brother, Mr. Lockhart, and in order to escape from his friends, whose sympathy made him hate them, he re- moved to New Orleans; and there, " in the land of sun and flowers," his weak, selfish, misguided wife died and was buried. Among the last of Mrs. Shelley's expressed wishes was one that Edith should be educated under the supervision and with the daughters of Madame Vansi; for, true to her nature, she spent many of her last moments in ambitious plans for the future of her beautiful daughter, and fears lest her natural advantages should not be amply:  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7897-00000011"/> cultivated; but she had well provided against that, for into no incompetent hands was the future heiress yielded, when, after a time, she was taken in charge by Madame Vansi, the ambitious, calculating, fascinating woman of the world. Charles having been sent to school in Lorburg, Mr. Lockhart had wished to have him at his house; but Mr. Shelley "thanked him, and preferred that Charles should remain where he had placed him; though he, of course, had permission to visit his relatives as often as the strictest attention to his studies would permit." Mrs. Lockhart, in her fear and pity for the motherless girl, begged to take charge of Edith; but this also was declined. "His daugh- ter would be for the present under the control of his aunt, Mrs. Thornton. In a few years he should take her to lPrance. Her mother had desired that she might to some extent be educated with the daughters of Madame Vansi. He had assented. With very sincere thanks for Mrs. Lockhart's kindness, he remained," etc. Indignantly the Lockharts resolved to make no further advances, and it was not till Charles had left for the University that they found how completely his boyish frankness bad won them over to himself at least. After the death of his wife, Mr. Shelley yielded Edith to the guidance of his aunt; with one direction, that she was not to be indoctrinated with theological cant; with one warning, that the first attempt to instill into her mind a "desire for grace" should be the signal for him to take her home. Accomplished she must be, and intelli- gent to the extent of her capacity (honest and neat, also, for that matter); and, "if intellectual growth demand what penny-a-liners call the sunshine of the heart, why, let Intellect have it, for Mind is King where Heart is the veriest slave that ever crouched beneath the lash; and if   Intellect absorb all nourishment, leavingo Heart to perish, why, let it die; so much the better for Heart and owner.', Sentiments expressed for the pleasure of uttering a cyni- cism, yet idly left to blossom and bear fruit. Idle words I Idle words How ye will one day rise before us, and, pointing each to wrong or ruin, claim your work! Thus he left her, and thus she grew to womanhood, inheriting the beauty, taste, and grace of her mother, and the liberality of her father, but inheriting also from the former a hasty and violent temper, from the latter that false pride which felled the Son of the Morning, By means of visits interchanged during the interval that elapsed between the period of her mother's death and that of Edith's final return to New Orleans, Mr. Shelley assured himself of the caliber of her intellect, while it was but too evident that the seeds of religious principle, sown by stealth and nourished in secret, had failed to flourish. There was so little reverence in her composition, and so much less credulity than reverence, that her father need not have feared the tending of her mind toward religion; only the careful guidance of a mother's hand might have led her in the narrow path. CHAPTER III. MRS. JAMES SHRiTAXY, having been requested by her brother-in-law to make his house her home, and to act as chaperone to his daughter, had made all things ready for the travelers, and, on the morning of their expected arrival, nervously flitted,-no, not flitted, she weighed '  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7897-00000012"/> 22       LEFT TO HERSELF. three hundred pounds if an ounce, maugre her five feet two of stature,--conveyed, transported herself from window to window, altering the fall of a curtain or the position of a vase, or stopping to listen as the sound of carriage-wheels drew near. As she thus stood, two hands were pressed lightly over her eyes, and a familiar voice inquired if the baggage had arrived. "Why, Charlie!" she exclaimed. "Dear me I how did you come? Where is your sister? Here is the carriage; there's brother Guy, and--oh I is that my niece?" Certainly it seemed sufficiently improbable. Salutations were exchanged, critical glances bestowed, a great many questions relative to the journey asked and answered, and in a short time the travelers had retired to their respective apartments. Late in the afternoon, as she left her chamber, Edith encountered a boy about thirteen years of age, and on being informed that his name was Harry, recollected that Mrs. James Shelley had a son, herself consequently a cousin, of that name. He stood before her, arrayed in his best roundabout in honor of the new arrival, dazzling collar, face all red and shining from the scrub compli- mentary, shoes a complete puff for Day &amp; Martin, and damp hair divided by the teeth of the comb into little platoons or families of hair; as if he had determined to render himself from head to foot one visible and unmis- takable compliment or demonstration of rejoicing. Edith kissed him, and hand in hand they wandered over the house. Pausing at a window, she exclaimed, "What a glorious sunset I Here are colors on the artist's palette -that shall paint the world to-morrow. 'The day is done, and slowly from the scene' The stooping sun upgathers his spent shafts, And puts them back into his golden quiver.'   LoFT TO HERSELF.        23 No, the coward Night has stabbed him in the back,-- look at the crimson streaks; but he dies bravely." "He dies hard,".said Harry. "He shows fight to the last That's the way my game chicken died; he was pecked all to pieces, the blood almost put his eyes out, but he died game. He fought to the last gasp, and went through the motions while he was dying. I tell you what I I'd like to be a game chicken,--I'd like to fight that way I It was the proudest day of my life when my chicken fought so Hand I buried him with military honors, like the soldier that he was I I fired two guns and a pack of squibs over his grave, and all the boys in the neighborhood came and brought their chickens to the funeral, and if they didn't have chickens they brought whatever they had, because, you see, Cousin Charlie put on the notice about ' the friends of the family,' and so there were more puppies than anything else; and Cousin Charlie came, and Mr. Bertnord, and Mr. Day, and they behaved like gentlemen, especially Charlie, he put up his handkerchief and fairly cried,--I heard him. You see, he gave me Napoleon,-that was my chicken's name. Napoleon, that my chicken was named after, was a great fighter, and used to whip everything he-- " "It seems to me I have heard of him. Wasn't there something about him in the newspapers?" "I've got a history that tells all about him. You may read it if you want to. And Nick White laughed. I didn't say anythihg to him then; but after the funeral was over, I went to him with a horsewhip and gave him fair warning that I was going to whip him for insulting my chicken's funeral; so I gave him. a cut, and he tried to hold me, but I 'most knocked the breath out of him; and then he got me down, and I told him I would whip him to death; and Charhe was coming'  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7897-00000013"/> 24       LEFT TO HERSEDF. anyhow, and so he was glad enough for me to let him off that easy." ( Who is Nick White? The boy I saw with you in the yard?" "Nick White? He's the ugliest, meanest, stingiest coward you ever saw I No, of course that wasn't Nick White! why, that was Jim Barnes. Nick White is a grown man, and he is in love with my sweetheart." "Who is that?" inquired Edith. "Miss Kate Manning." ( How old is she?" "Oh, I don't know. About as old as you, maybe." Edith's hearty laugh disconcerted her boy-cousin some- what; but, recovering himself, he continued: "You wait 1 She lives next door to us; our yard looks right up in their windows. She and her mother haven't been here long, and Nick White is their cousin." "Who is Mr. Day?" "Simon Day? He's a lawyer here; but Uncle Guy says he'll never be worth a cent. He is always read- ing plays, and going to the theater, and talking like an actor." "Ahl charming! We can have theatricals. What do you think of Charlie?" she asked, as he entered, unob- served by Harry. "Charles is meddlesome," said the boy, dolefully. "( Charlie would do very well if he would not be so med- dlesome, but he's always running me off the track." "Well, the Philistines be upon thee, Samson!"And Harry wrenched his ear from between Charlie's fingers. "What do you mean, you unmannerly chimpanzee, by speaking in that style of me and my friends? An unmiti- gated  " "A what i"   -  '   LEFT TO HERSEL F.        25 "To speak freely, then, as one cousin should to another: of all animals under heaven, the unmitigated schoolboy is the most uncouth and vociferous; the least manageable,  and most addicted to small vices peculiar and agreeable to himself, but obnoxious to the feelings of everything else, from the ill-conditioned cat he delights to persecute, to the full-grown man he strives to imitate." Harry waxed indignant, and defiantly exclaimed, "You were a schoolboy once yourself; I'd like to know what you areblaming me for?" "Ah, true; and, upon reflection, I do not blame you. The being disagreeable is incident to your age. I may have been so myself." "If you were more disagreeable then than you are now  " "Exactly. Do not trouble yourself further. I antici- pate you." The sun had with royal munificence showered rich gifts on his cloud-parasites; he departed, and they hastened from his halls, eager, slavelike, to don their new livery. Twi- light gathered, the moon arose, and sentinel stars paced through the corridors of night. Another day was dead; another child of Time had been devoured by the ogre Eternity; another step had been taken toward the great bourn ; another hope for the future, another claim on God, had slipped from the grasp. Harry left the room, and the brother and sister became silent, each lost in thought,-he, building the chateaux end Espagne which men young, vigorous,- ambitious, are wont to build; and she, questioning Probability as to the life now beginning in her new home. Charles at length broke the silence:. "I saw Ned Bert- ndrd to-day, Edith, and asked hinm up to tea. Do you recollect him?"' 3  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7897-00000014"/> 26       LEFT TO HERSELF. "Very slightly. Your letters have kept his shadow flitting across my mind; otherwise I should probably have forgotten him altogether." "He is not much of a lady's-man; but you must culti- vate his friendship for my sake. I believe he likes me more than he does any other man living; and I ant very sure I shall never love any woman as I love him. I am glad you are such a proficient in music: he is fond of it; and it will be one means of securing his friendship." "Is it, then, at once so important and so difficult a mat- ter to please this Mr. Bertnord?' "I had hoped that the fact of his being my friend would endue him with some importance in your estimation." "It does, Charlie." "I feel the greatest desire that you should win his friendship. You come here a stranger and enter society with perhaps no friend among " "Aunt Laura will be a nuisance--' only this, and no- thing more.' I never knew a woman of station so utterly devoid of style." "Very true," answered Charles; " but she is dependent; so we must be morecareful in our deportment than would otherwise be necessary." Edith shrugged her shoulders. "Then I wish father had given her an income and permitted me to select some other chaperone. Madame Vansi would faint " "But," interposed Charles, who did not like his sister's tone, yet was unwilling to commence aught that savored of dissension, " it is not of lady friends that I was speak- ing. I had reference to those of the other sex. No doubt you will have admirers, lovers; but a friend is what I want for you, to act in my place when I shall be hard at work learning to labor by learning to wait. Girls often make themselves ridiculous, when, if they had one friend   LEFT TO HERSELF.         217  among all the gentlemen around, they might be spared the mortification. Bertnord goes constantly into society;  Bertnord has more judgment, more independence, more candor, than any one else; you see, therefore," he con- tinued, smiling, "you must cultivate Bertnord." '4 But suppose I fall in love with Bertnord, or Bertnord falls in love with me? Describe him." "Not at all handsome, if that is what you want to know; nor anything of a lady's-man. Dyspeptic, therefore never happy unless he is miserable. Quiet in manner; indif- ferent to the generality of things and people; sometimes brusque; often witty; always a gentleman. I do not think you will fall in love with Bertnord; nor will Bertnord, I venture to say, fall in love with you." "hMr. Day?" "Stage-struck; and nothing to back it." "Mr. White, \-Nick White, as Harry calls him?" "Nick White is a blockhead, who, on the Peaks of Otter (there are grander places, but I love the Peaks :- we will go there some day), instead of gazing on the exquisite scenery, would be trying to decipher the initials other blockheads had busied themselves in cutting. This done, he would industriously carve his own. Then he would take lunch." During the evening Mr. Bertnord presented himself. "Mr. Bertnord, ain't she pretty?" inquired Harry, nod- ding toward Edith. She was not easily disconcerted, but her cqlor rose some- what as Mr. Bertnord, turning from her father, with whom he had been conversing, coolly looked at her, as at a pic- ture or a vase to which his attention had been directed. After a short but deliberate survey, he said that most persons would pronounce her beautiful, and in fact he considered her rather a good-looking young person him-  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7897-00000015"/> 28       LEFT TO HERSELF. self. Harry then volunteered a statement of his expectation that lots of fellows would court her; whereupon Mr. Bert- nord said, "Undoubtedly," and Harry was sent to bed. Mr. Day also spent the evening at Mr. Shelley's, and said to Mr. Bertnord, as the two left the house together, "Do you remember a Miss Lockhart who spent last winter here? She and Miss Shelley are wonderfully alike." "You cannot say too little about the Lockharts there. The families are in some way connected,--I don't know how; but I do know that Mr. Shelley had rather see glim Death cross his threshold than any of the Lockhart blood." "And why this deadly feud 'twixt house and house?" asked Simon. "Some family quarrel years ago, I believe. So far as I can judge, Mr. Shelley was wrong; but he is obstinate as a mule and vindictive as an elephant, and the younger members of the family have hot heads and proud hearts, -things in no wise conducive to the reconciling of difficulties and promoting of peace. So they live, and so they'll die, and so the world wags." "And wags as merrily laugh we or sorrow," said Simon. That which youth and beauty might have failed to accomplish, novelty and wealth did. They made Edith Shelley the loved and envied, the hated and caressed,-in a word, the belle of "Japonicadom,"- in New Orleans. Her name was on the lip before champagne bubbled against the moustache ; serenades sent Mr. Shelley growling to the back of the house, and no young man of the season was thought worthy his diploma in love-making who had not gone through a course of instruction from her. She seemed to suit all tastes. One hour so calm, so cold, withal so lovely, that you were reminded of the beautiful, deadly snow, the treacherous snow, that will receive so tenderly,   LEFT TO HERSELF.         29 touch so softly, lull to such dire sleep. Oh, beautiful, deadly snow, treacherous snowl Again there is such a frank smile on her sweet lips, such a joyous look in her bonny eyes, that the very heart in your bosom bounds its way out to her dainty feet. Many a jealous, aching heart and stinging conscience did Edith cause; while she, caring for nobody, though so many cared for her, loved her brother, liked Mr. Bertnord, abhorred her aunt, and was happy. iCHAPTE R IV. CHAPTER IV. FLORENCE and Mr. Muncair checked their horses as they attained the summit of an elevation which anywhere, ex- cept in or about Lorburg, would have been called a hill. I am sorry they did not select a spring day for their ride. I should like to tell how beautiful are those old woods, rich in flowers, redolent of honeysuckle, dotted with dog- wood-trees, the branches of which look like outstretched arms, offering their all of white blossoms; later still, decked with laurel or the plumelike blossoms of the ash. As it was, they saw millions of green leaves, a good deal of sumac, and the Tennessee train crossing a bridge. The smoke from the engine floated awav; the whistle was heard no more; frogs were croaking; insects chirp- ing lullabies to their little ones; and above, a belated crow flapped hurriedly homeward, cawing as it went, for want of words. For almost the first time in his life, Frank Muncair wanted to speak and was at a loss what to say. He had made love to other women, but always with a due 3*  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7897-00000016"/> 30       LEFT TO HER JSELF. sense of his own advantages, and a corresponding degree of confidence. Now, he respected and admired, as much as ]he loved, the girl by his side, and hesitated longer because he risked more. At last, taking off his hat and pushing the hair from his brow, he said, abruptly,- "I shall not go to-morrow. I am superstitious. I asked myself a moment ago, 'Shall I ever be here again?-or, being here, be happy as now?' And a thou- sand voices there among the trees whispered back the raven's sad refrain, 'Never more.'" "You mistook the voice," said Florence, with a laugh and a blush. "It- is that cow-bell you should have been listening to,- saying, ' Seven o'clock! seven o'clock! ' Come."7 "But it is not seven o'clock." "Oh, yes, it is. The bell says so. And se6 that Irish- man throwing his coat and pickaxe over his shoulder. That is preparatory to leaving." "Is he a part of the scenery? Will there be nothing worth remaining for after his pickaxe shall have disap- peared?" Mr. Muncair addressed the man as he went by: "My watch has run down, and this lady and I differ about the hour. Can you tell what it is-?" "No, sir; an', bedad, I'm afther doubtin' how ye'll find out, barrin' you look at the clock this time to-mor- row." "Humph! would it not answer to find out what time it was this time yesterday?" "Don't know, indade, sir. I was at work in the field beyant, an' left at twelve o'clock yisterday."  Mr. Muncair turned to Florence: "Why shorten our last ride? Do not insist on going." "But see how late it is."   JUvY BU "z' ittSEL:F.      31 A pause; then he said, "I love you. I love you dearlyv.

Answer my question first." "But it is so late." "Do not be afraid. I shall take good care of the one who is dearest to me. Do you  " "But I prefer riding.

"Loose my bridle I See those people staring at you." "You must answer me." "Must?" "Yes." "Oh, loose the bridle 1" "If you say that again I shall think it means yes. Shall I let it go?" "Yes," she whispered; but he retained it long enough to add an ejaculation "-appropriate to the occasion." In the evening, when about to take leave of the family, he said, "I will not say good-by. It shall be only,' Sweet flower,' good-night; for I cannot go to-morrow. I have not the heroism.." "No, stay and hear John preach his first sermon. Mr. Bryant is absent, and John will supply his place the day after to-morrow." "Oh, yes; I must stay and hear John, by all means. John detains me unavoidably." Turning to the young  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7897-00000017"/> 32       LEFT TO HERSELF. clergyman, he said, "Miss Florence tells me that you are to occupy the pulpit next Sunday. I am glad of it, and shall certainly remain to hear you." "Thank you." "Cousin John," said a little girl present, " please take out your watch, and don't preach but five minutes. Oh me I I do get so tired every Sunday I I wonder how you would like to sit still and hear me talk a whole hour without saying a word yourself?" "The thought is too painful," John answered, as he took the child between his knees and stroked her hair. "She would be quite as entertaining as are some of you," said Mr. Lockhart. "You take advantage of the fact that it is considered rude to leave during the service, and so keep two or three hundred people before you,- doing what? Admiring you? Thinking what a good man you are, what sinners they are? Getting religion, as you call it? Not a bit of it I They are wishing you had lockjaw. They are wondering whether you think you are saying anything,--any one thing that has not been better said a thousand times before, and that is not being now said by half the ministers in the country.

If vou want to exercise your lungs, go to the woods, and halloo! But don't preach for the sake of hearing yourself preach. If you want to say something that your soul is full of,- something that people will be the better for hearing,- then go to the pulpit and say it. And unless you want people to confound the idea of religion with that of some bore of a minister, and so to get rid of both as far as pos- sible, master the sublime art of sitting down,-an art which has been said to be the highest accomplishment of   LEFT TO HERSELF.        33 parliamentary science. But I am wrong in saying that there is no gratification in hearing a patent-extension minister, and am reminded of N. P. Willis: ' No poetry in a steamboat? Think of the blessed cry of, Stop her 1 You not only talk too much, you talk too carelessly. Why don't you think before you preach? /Why stand in the pulpit and utter sentiments which are mere senti- ments? pronounce opinions which are mere reflexes of other men's? advocate or denounce according to canon and rubric  " "Granting that the preacher's opinions are, as you say, reflexes, they are probably the creations of abler minds than his own; and no safer guide can he find than that of canon and rubric," answered John, quietly. "Then let him read the sermons of those abler minds, and not do a second time less impressively what has been once well done. Let him say,' I wish to speed the word of God, let me cast in my mite by reading to you what wiser and better men than I have said and written I' But I have heard many clergymen offer as pure gold what would pass through the sieve of canon and rubric as chaff; enforcing controvertible and, because controvert- ible, injurious platitudes, launched and kept afloat by bigotry.. Men don't want to believe what you say; and if this saving of souls be n-ot mere child's play, look at the mischief of one error. You may think it a sin to dance; but, before you denounce it in the pulpit, leave the world to dance awhile, and go you into your closet with God and your Bible and find where the sin lies. Grant- ing as a possible thing that a little more dancing will injure one or two more men and women, it is absolutely certain that one error on your part gives sinners leave to doubt you next time. Don't say a thing is a sin un- less you know it. And if you know it, prove it.

Don't be afraid to investigate anything. Truth is what you pretend to teach; truth, what people pretend to be looking for; and if you won't look too deep for what's on the surface, maybe you will help some poor soul to get to heaven, and, for aught I know to the contrary, get there yourself. Were you to ask your congregation to-day, What is religion? tile answer would remind you of him who said,' A poet? Why, a poet- is as much as to say-a poet.' No, no; common sense and everyday intercourse with your ungodly fellows is what you ministers need." "Perhaps so, sir," said John; ' but the sad will call us merry, the gay will say we are grave; the lax will pronounce us rigid, the severe will call us lax." "That's all right. You are public servants, and must obey the public whim. Be all things to all men." "We are God's servants, and must submit to no man's whim," said John. "How I wish you were to spend this winter also in New Orleans, instead of going to Florida 1" said Mr. Mun- cair to Florence. "I am tempted to murder Day every -time I think of his having known you half a winter with- out saying a word to me about it; though the fellow should have known he was keeping me out of a fortune." He scribbled in a note-book, and handed it to Florence. "Men;.: To cut Day's throat as soon as I get home." "Spare him!" she said, in reply. "I hardly knew Mr. Day; and you forget how little I went out till the winter was nearly over,-till mother's health improved so much." "No," he said, "I cannot forget what first attracted my admiration. Truly, 'many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.' But good-night   LEFT TO HERSELF.         35 again. For the last half-hour I have been humming to myself the song, ' How can I leave thee?' " "Walking through the front door is the mode of egress usually adopted by visitors." "Thanks for the suggestion. To-morrow I expect to hold that front door in loving remembrance; but it is much more attractive beheld from without than from within. " John Lockhart was the only son of his mother, and she a widow. His father had been an Episcopal clergy- man, and it was the most earnest wish of his mother's heart that he should follow in the steps of that good man; but his thoughts tended otherwise,--his dreams were dreams of worldly ambition and honor among men These nothing could have induced him to relinquish, save the desire to gratify his loved and loving but mistaken mother. Even this for a long time failed; but when sick- ness prostrated her, and he saw the tide of life ebbing fast, he could not be firm. Grief gave a solemnity to his feelings, and the neighborhood of death a color to his thoughts, which to a great extent deceived himself; and his mother died happy in the promise of her son that he would become one of the ministers of Christ. Entering at once upon the study of divinity, the same causes operated to deceive others, and his fitness for the high position of a man of God was never doubted; but when time had dulled the edge of grief, when sorrow had retreated farther within his heart, then God alone knew the darkness and the torture of his soul. But he was too proud to turn aside from the path he had chosen; he was ashamed to cast from him the mask of sanctity, once having worn it. We have to a great extent anticipated the current of his emotions, for. at present he was but,  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7897-00000019"/> 36     . LEEFT TO HERSELF. dimly conscious of the course they were taking, and honestly endeavoring to perform his duty; but the strug- gle was great, and the man's heart sore within him. The Sabbath-day broke bright and fair. The breath of morning awoke the branches of the brave old trees, and with their leafy tongues they murmured orisons to the universal Father. The spirit of repose seemed hovering over all things,--over the blooming garden, the wide fields, and the far-off orchard. The gay flowers nodded their morning salutations to each other, and offered in silence their fragrant incense; the sunbeams silently descended to the fields and whispered unto each that which it should bring forth to the glory of His name. Loud und clear sounded the cry which reminded the disciple of the saddest and gentlest reproach ever given; from afar came the shrill answer, another, and another. The clergyman sat at his window in the early morning and drew a picture of the future. There was a great crowd assembled,-men and women and children,-and among them all there was a deep hush, while words of eloquence and fire, strange and startling, poured from the mouth of the one man speak- ing,-the man of God. And as the flood grew deeper, and the torrent burst forth, and the solitary voice re-echoed through the house, the people swayed to and fro, and looked with awe upon the messenger, and cried, "What shall we do to be saved '"Then deep silence fell upon them all, and the man lifted up his voice in prayer, and as it trembled above them the people slowly knelt, and, kneeling, wept. And they asked of them- selves, "Who is this strange man that cometh among us?" After years had rolled on, and the young man had   LEFT TO HERSELF.        37 grown old, he sat by the same window, and, looking back upon the past, wept bitterly. On their way to church, Frank Muncair said to Flor- ence, "I shall never forget a scene I once witnessed in North Carolina. The preacher (an eccentric fellow, as you will perceive) had been holding forth on the subject of moral diseases, moral infections, and moral death, while his congregation sat complacently listening, each satisfied that this verbal castigation could not be applied to his or her irreproachable shoulders. 'With what jeal- ous care,' said he,' do you guard your children against the physical diseases incident to childhood I Become of an age when their souls are transferred to their own keeping, with what mad recklessness you expose them to the moral contagion of the world I Some of you are morally dying the death of the Drunkard; some of you are morally wasting away with the slow fever of Envy; some of you are morally consumed by the fierce fires of Jealousy and Hate; some of you are morally pitted with the cares of Avarice; some of you have daily on your lips the deadly poison of Profanity; yet,'--an expression of pity and disdain overspread his features, and, pointing at a man in the crowd whose face had on it some erup- tion, he asked, 'yet, how many among you all can calmly learn that in your midst is a man who has the physical disease-smallpox? Ha, ha oh, what a panic there was I What unmannerly haste among the gentle- men who had so softly set down their hats, and with their feet drawn the spittoons a little nearer H-among the ladies who had so gently passed their fingers over their hair, and drawn their glove-lace a little tighter as they settled themselves in, their seats and piously glanced around to see that others were deporting themselves with  4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7897-00000020"/> equal propriety I Your church would present rather a sombre appearance were it not for those trees; they re- lieve the aspect to some extent." is John will have a good congregation to-day." This in a whisper, after they were seated; and he continued his remarks, on various subjects, till she handed him a Prayer- Book, open at the sentence, "The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before Him." He raised his eyebrows, smiled slightly, and went through the service like a parish clerk, somewhat to the annoyance of his fair rebuker, who did not place great faith in this sudden manifestation of devotion; but so absorbed had he become in prayers and responses that she found it im- possible to attract his attention, so betook herself to her own prayers, " with a pure heart and humble voice." The stillness was broken only by the tramp of horses, as they shook off the flies that tormented them, and the rustling of leaves pressing gently against the window, as though they too would hear the word of life. Then the young minister slowly opened the book before him, paused a moment, fixing by his calm, earnest gaze the attention of the people, and said, in a low tone, "And they all forsook Him, and fled." Mark, xiv. 50. "Viewed merely as the life of a good man, that of Jesus Christ is the saddest the world has ever known; and saddest of all that moment when, the multitude coming out as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take Him, they who had said unto Him, ' Master, we know that Thou art true, and teachest the way of life,' they who had asked with fear and sorrow in their hearts, ' Lord, is it I who shall betray thee?' they, his disciples, whom He loved, ' they all forsook Him, and fled.'" As he continued, describing the guilelessness'and self- abasement, the purity and humiliation, the beauty and   the suffering, of the earthly life of our Saviour, the loving- kindness with which He encircles us now, and the traitor kiss by which many of us repay Him, the words which, were I to write and you to read them here, would seem tame and cold, came fraught with life and power, in those low, sorrowful tones, assisted by the, magnetic gaze of those great sad eyes, which seemed to seek out each soul, saying, "And thou too hast betrayed Him, and thou too, when thy vices and follies have gone out against Him, thou, even thou, his disciple, hast forsaken Him, and fled." His own silent prayer was, "Saviour, grant that I may not, by unfitly becoming thy minister, give Thee the kiss of betrayal." As Florence and Frank walked home, they were joined by John, who burst into a hearty laugh at something Frank was saying. The latter turned to him with mock solemnity: "Brother, let us have no such unseemly con- duct Sunday morning." "Frank," said John, "I do believe you to be a good fellow, but, upon my word, you are as frivolous as a girl." "Gently, gently, Jack, or we shall resort to corporeal argument. In other words, I shall have to thrash that notion out of you. It is the part of wisdom to venerate a big fist, so run on ahead. I can take care of Miss Flor- ence. I see you want to call me an impertinent scoun- drel, only it's Sunday morning. All right; we will sup- pose you said so yesterday. You look disappointed. Well, if it's too good to be lost, you can say so to-morrow. Call at ten." John laughed again, saying, as he walked off, that there would be occasion, no doubt. "I don't know  what you ladies think of it," said Frank, " but to me the greatest bores in the world are  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7897-00000021"/> 40       LEFT TO HERSELF. your sweetheart's relations,-a man, for instance, who, when you go with his sister to church or take his cousin out walking, keeps three feet behind you, or half a yard in advance, and talks railroads.

Florence twirled her parasol, unconscious of the pique evinced by her heightened color and curved lips, as she answered, "I think you seem to have had a great many sweethearts." Frank was surprised, amused, and flattered. Oh, Flor- ence 1I Florence I CHAPTER    V. DRESSED for a ball, Edith stood before her mirror, sur- veying with a critic's eye the effect of her toilet. Her triumphant smile was sufficient comment. "Catharine, bring my fan from Aunt Laura's room, and observe her dress." Catharine presently returned with an account of Mrs. Shelley's toilet, and the color rushed to Edith's face, while with angry haste she left the room. "I will not   LEFT TO HERSELF.         1 go with her I I will not be made ridiculous I I will not submit to itl Yes, I am determined never to go into company with her, never to tolerate her presence, never to speak to her again, unless she dresses better 1"But, as she recalled what Charles had said of her aunt's dependent situation, Edith's step became slow, her brow less contracted, her lips less firmly closed, and there en- sued a contest between innate generosity and the fear of being laughed at. She met Charlie, who inquired,- "What's the excitement now?" "This: that Aunt Laura dresses more intolerably than any other woman in New Orleans, and I feel completely disconcerted on entering a room with her; yet I cannot prevent it, because I might wound her feelings. If she would only adopt a rational suggestion I If her absurd ideas were not so perfectly immutable I But it is useless to advise or select in her behalf; she only gives freer vent to her taste, or want of it, next time.

And do not talk yourself into a passion again. You do not care for these people " "I care for what they think." "And if you do, be brave enough to defy their laugh. Half of them do not know what is in good taste, what in bad; while Aunt Laura, though so mistaken, is so sincere in her-desire to please us that " "Yes, there again is her bad taste. I suggest an alteration in her dress. She yields, but regretfully; she is wounded, though submissive. Then I feel that she is degraded and I am playing the tyrant."

In the hall leading to' the ball-room stoot Edward Bert- nord, drawing on his glove, when a gentleman ap- proached, and, placing one hand familiarly on his shoulder, exclaimed, "Well, Bertnord, how's the dyspepsia? You are looking as sour and yellow as a lemon." "Why, Muncair I I am glad to see you. When did you get back?" "Yesterday," answered Frank. "What is going on? Anybody dead or married, sent to the penitentiary, or condemned to Congress?" i"Not so bad as that; but you owe me a pair of boots; Brown is in the Legislature." "Ah? Poor fellow! Misfortunes never come singly, as I remarked with my wonted originality when he lost that fine trotter.

What more need be said?" "Poor child I I must see her to-morrow. Why, who is that so like-who is that dancing with Day?" "Miss Edith Shelley. Old Guy's daughter. She has created a considerable sensation, and is, in reality, quite worth knowing. Shall I introduce you?"   LEFT TO HERSELF.         43 "No, I thank you. I never admired tiger-lilies." "What do you mean?" "Oh, a lily, you know, is a lily, and a woman a woman. But all lilies are not to my taste; ditto concerning women. Is not Miss Shelley strong-minded, or blue, or anti-Christian, or something equally "Miss Sherley is my friend," said Mr. Bertnord. Frank twirled his moustache, and smiled quizzically: "Excuse me. I had not an idea that the ground was dangerous." "Your comparison can have no just reference to Miss Shelley, for, as regards nobility of character, I would not wish her otherwise were she my sister. She is neither strong-minded, as you use the term, nor more anti-Chris- tian than are many who profess differently. Like most of our acquaintance, she cares nothing about religion, one way or the other; unlike them all, she does not affect an interest she has never been taught to feel. I am sorry for it, for, though no Christian myself, I should like my sweetheart, wife, or sister to be one. But in a nature so noble as Miss Edith's the absence of religious culture has left a vacuum, not a gangrene." "Do you think that possible, Ned?" "I certainly do." "Very well. I will not say you nay. Suppose we make our devoirs to the hostess." They- did so, and separated; Mr. Muncair joining a group of three or four gentlemen who had withdrawn fi'om the dances and were deep in a discussion grown out of the mention of a communication which had ap- peared in one of the evening papers, and which, in fact, Frank himself had written that morning in the office of the Crescent. "No," Charles Shelley was saying, "the doctrine is   &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7897-00000023"/> "      LEFT TO HERSELF. pernicious, and the whole argument, from beginning to end, a string of sophisms, calculated to attract and please the popular fancy, and to mislead the many who are un- willing or unable to think for themselves. I tell you, sir, the writer of that article is too clever a man not to have seen the falsity of his position; and his duplicity in taking it can be explained only on the supposition of his being that bond-slave-an office-seeker." "Before you express your opinion more freely, sir," said Mr. Muncair, angrily, "I wish to inform you that I wrote the article, and that I am the man in question." Charles turned and looked haughtily at him. "I have already expressed my opinion, sir, quite as freely as the importance of the case demands." "Why, halloo I Nonsense, gentlemen!" said one of the group. "You misunderstand each other. Mr. Muncair, allow me to introduce my friend Mr. Shelley. The fact is, Muncair, you must not have anything to say about our city affairs for at least a week. You have been gone three months, and in the very first paragraph of the article evince an evident misapprehension of the whole business, while Shelley here knows all about it, and knows you are wrong. Explain the matter, Shelley." Charles proceeded to do so, Frank entiering warmly into the discussion, and repelling with vehement elo- quence the charges brought against him. While listen- ing, and often while himself speaking, he looked intently at Edith, partly because of her position directly in front -of him; unconsciously attracted, too, by her likeness to his fiancee. Even when, more than once, their eyes met, so absorbed was he in the subject of conversation, that he neither looked nor turned away. This naturally at- tracted her attention, and during the evening she inquired the name of the stranger. The answer was that he was   LEFT TO HERSELF.        45 no stranger, but a resident of New Orleans. That he had many acquaintances was evident as he made his way through the crowd, and appearances vouched for their being all friends. He did not, as Edith had supposed be would, seek an introduction to herself. He and a friend approached, but delayed only a moment while Mr. Mun- cair lifted and returned a handkerchief that had fallen at her feet. Not long afterward, she heard some one on the other side of the folding-doors say, "Let me introduce you to the loveliest woman you ever saw,--Miss Shelley." "I'll flee this house," seemed to be the reply. "Are you all Shelley mad? I have already refused three bffers of introduction, and here it is again,-' Let me in- troduce you to Miss Shelley '!" "If you should not admire her, you willlike her enter- tainments and her father's cook." "Well, thank you. When I need refreshments, and cannot find a restaurant, I will get you to call with me on Miss Shelley." Looking up, he saw a head turned and slightly thrown back, that he might encounter the look of disdain with which he was regarded ere the eyes of the owner were quietly withdrawn, and Edith herself moved off to make her adieus to her hostess. Kate Manning and Mr. Kemper were promenading the balcony, discussing the "theme of the minstrel, love." With all the strength of his soul he loved her, and with all the clinging tenderness of her helpless nature was his love returned; but two barriers separated them. One was poverty,--that might be removed; the other, inexorable as death to one of Kate's irresolute nature, was the will of her mother; a cold, ambitious, manceu-, vring woman, who had eloped ungratefully, married  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7897-00000024"/> "       LEFT TO HERSELF. hastily, and found leisure to repent. The love which drapes with beauty and makes radiant with happiness even the gaunt form of poverty, was not there. The first bitter word was spoken, the first stitch dropped: then, how ruthlessly did Passion ravel the web that Fancy and Romance had woven! All the attempts of her hus- band to please and gratify her to the utmost extent of his limited means were repulsed with contempt that wounded fatally his love, mortified his pride, and exhausted his patience. What need to tell of the consequent bitterness and recrimination? In a few years Mr. Manning died. She married again, and, ere Kate was grown, again be- came a widow,-Mrs. White. Regarding Mr. Kemper's admiration for Kate, her mother would long since have become alarmed, for he was poor, but that Kate (not for the purpose of deceiving her mother more than herself) had ever been in manner colder to him than to others. Moreover, Mrs. White could not have believed that the cautions and lectures she had for years bestowed on her daughter could be so willfully dis- regarded as to admit of that daughter yielding her heart without what her mother would have regarded as an equivalent in gold. This was now at her feet represented by Nicholas White, a man whose mental capacity was as feeble as his physical form was unsightly. Still, " that dear Mr. White" was not unwelcome in the parlors of some mothers who had daughters to dispose of; inimmen- sity of fortune too often atoning for littleness of soul, and the depth of a purse for shallowness both of heart and of intellect. It was not till after Kate and Mr. Kemper were en- gaged that Mrs. White became alarmed; but, her fears once aroused, she availed herself of his temporary absence from New Orleans to hasten the courtship of her nephew,   LEFT TO HERSELF.       4:7 the Nicholas aforementioned. It was not long before he had offered Kate his hand, which she rejected, at the same time beseeching him not to mention the circumstance to her mother, as his doing so would be useless, while it would be painful to all parties; but with this request the gentleman did not think proper to comply, for his vanity,--oh, tender point!-his vanity was wounded, and he complained to Mrs. White of what he termed "Kate's coquetry." Mrs. White replied that this rejection was the result of timidity; advised him not to be too urgent; to give her time to think, etc. The creature was dis- pleased that Kate should not have been eager to assume the position of his wife; but Mrs. White talked to him, and argued with him, and loaded his weak 'brain with such an endless array of words that he allowed his vanity to be soothed and hope rekindled. On Kate, Mrs. White urged the necessity for treating the nephew of her late stepfather with courtesy and kind- ness. She might not love him, but he had paid her the highest compliment in his power; and merely because she did not reciprocate his affection she had -no right to scorn the offer of it. The matter placed thus, assumed to Kate another aspect. She now believed that Mrs. White would not use her influence in favor of her nephew; and this belief, placing her entirely at ease, made her more than usually charming to her admirer, who began to feel con- fident that his aunt had judged correctly. When Mr. Kemper returned, he found his betrothed receiving apparently as a matter of course the attentions of her cousin, and Mrs. White speaking confidentially of "dear Kate's prospects." In vain did Kate protest that her mother did not wish to force her into marrying Mr. White, and that he had almost ceased to hope it. Mr. Kemper knew too well  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7897-00000025"/> 48       LEFT TO HERSELF. both the nephew and aunt to accept this view, and, know- ing also Kate's pliant nature, he very reasonably dreaded the result of their machinations. Believing that he should run less risk were Mrs. White openly to war against his suit, than if she strove to frustrate it by secret opposition, he asked and obtained of Kate, while they promenaded the balcony on the night of the ball, permission to seek an early interview with her mother. Mrs. White listened in silence till Mr. Kemper had ceased speaking, then said, coldly, "I can scarcely believe, sir, that you come to me with the permission of Miss Manning." "She will herself inform you, Mrs. White, that such is the case."          "I regret, then, sir, that my daughter should so far forget herself as to coquet with one gentleman while en- gaged to another, and to force upon me the unpleasant duty of announcing to you the disappointment of your hopes. She has long been betrothed to my nephew Mr. White." "But, madam," pursued Mr. Kemper, " your daughter informs me that such is not the case. Pardon me if I say that I feel assured that she has at present no inten- tion of becoming the wife of your nephew." "Had such not been her intention, Miss Manning would scarcely have confided the fact to a new acquaintance. You flatter yourself, sir." "Your daughter's happiness, madam, is, of course, your first care; may I, if that be concerned, hope you will not oppose our union?" "When I shall have inquired of Miss Manning the secret of her extraordinary procedure, I shall, perhaps, be better prepared to give you an answer. Good-morn- ing, sir." And the lady, after bowing her visitor out of the room, proceeded to that of her daughter.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        49 " Kate, what am I to think ? Can it be possible that you gave Mr. Kemper permission to consult me with regard to his prospect of becoming my son-in-law ?" " Certainly, mother." "Upon my word," said Mrs. White, "I should like to have my nephew's ideas on the subject. What do you suppose your fiance would think of it?" "What do'you mean, mother ? I am not engaged to your nephew." "You cannot possibly withdraw.   You have gone too far. This is childish. You must give up your flirta- tion with Mr. Kemper," returned Mrs. White. Kate became pale and sick at heart. Without a word she seated herself on an ottoman, and, resting her folded arms on the seat of a chair, leaned her head wearily down. " Mother," she said, at last, " mother, all my life long I have yielded to your guidance. You have never taught me to exercise self-reliance, judgment, or courage; all you have clainmed from me was obedience, and obedience I have given; but in this thing I cannot obey you. I cannot permit you to decide the course of my future life, because my heart has already decided. I will not marry your nephew." " Kate, my child, what can you mean ? What except love could I infer from your late conduct to Mr. White ? Have you not, since he asked you to become his wife, been more cordial to him than ever .before ? Am I to call you a jilt ?" "Did you not tell me," asked Kate, "that it would wound you should I be cold and formal to a relative of your husband? You gave me permission to consult my own feelings regarding his proposal." " Certainly, my dear. Of course I did, and was glad 5&#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7897-00000026"/> '50      LEFT TO HERSELF. to perceive that your heart prompted you to the exhibi- tion of greater kindness than was necessary to show that he was not disagreeable to you. It never occurred to me that you were flirting with him." "'Nor was I. I have no taste for flirting which could enable me to endure the society of Mr. White." "Kate, be silent!" "If he has any faith in my word, he should compre- hend my detestation of his despicable character, for I took the trouble to explain it." "Ladylike in the extreme," retorted her mother. "I am glad he thought it mere childishness. That he did so is evident, for he was speaking last night of the lmagnifi- cent bridal presents be intends to make you. What, pray, would be Mr. Kemper's bridal present? A wash- board or a churn. You will have to go through a different course of education, young lady, before you are, fitted to be anything but the idle wife of a rich man." "I acknowledge that," said Kate, bitterly; "but I am neither too old nor too proud to learn." "Nonsense I with Nicholas White's money you can be what you choose; admired, envied, copied. As Mrs. Kemper you will never be heard of. The former, having nothing to occupy him, will ever be at your service, and, untroubled by pecuniary difficulties, always in a good humor; while Mr. Kemper, when not from home working to get the morrow's bread, will have been so harassed -by business cares as to be ill-tempered and disagreeable, especially to you, on whom will fall the drudgery of keeping house with no money." "You speak, madam, as though Mr. Kemper were a pauper." "In comparison with Nicholas, he is."   LEFT TO HERSELF.        51 "He has a rich mind and talent " "Tut! I read somewhere, to-day, that protracted anxiety as to how she should make both ends meet, with a large family and uncertain income, drove Southey's first wife ilnto a lunatic at ylum. And as for talent-let me inform you that talent will do at the dessert-table, but first we must have the bread and meat of common sense. And do you know what common sense does'? Common sense, my dear, makes money. I know what will most conduce to happiness, child; be guided by me."                   , Going to her own room, Mrs. White opened her desk for the purpose of writing to Mr. Kemper; declining, with a superfluity of politeness almost insulting, the pro- posal with which he had thought proper to honor them; adding, too,-for she could not believe that the irresolute Kate would take any decided step in the affair,-that Miss Manning, of course, sanctioned the proceedings of lier mother in this instance. Kate also wrote to her lover. She told him that her - , mother, having been under the impression that she (Kat:6' was engaged to Mr. White, had probably declined Mr:: - tKemper's proposal, but of course without the sanction of. her daughter. "I was not aware," she wrote, "when I gave the permission you requested, of the delusion under which my mother was laboring. It was a mis- take on her part, owing perhaps to a want -of candor on mine. I do not know that at first she will receive you kindly, but she will finally learn to love you, though the usurper of what she considers the rightful throne of her nephew.

White might well have called a blush even to her face, albeit unused to the blushing mood. Kate and her mother were that evening seated in the parlor when Mr. Kemper was announced. The former eagerly started up and offered him her hand, her face all bright with welcome; but Mrs. White, bestowing on her daughter a glance of reproof and astonishment, saluted the gentleman with her most distant bow. For somie time they conversed on commonplace topics, but the conversation begtan to flag, and Mr. Kemper won- dered if Mrs. White supposed he intended transferring his attentions to herself, that she remained present so long. It was his earnest wish to converse with Kate alone, that he might discover the position affairs had really assumed; but he was not gratified on that occasion, for Mrs. White retained her seat, until, annoyed beyond endurance, he took leave. Kate immnediately went to her own room, the door of which she locked, and when AIrs White knocked for admittance, said, pettishy, that she did not wish to be disturbed. This only rendered her mother more decided in her course of action. If Kate wished to walk or drive, Mrs. White expressed a desire to be her companion. If Mr. Kemper called, Mrs. White shared with her daughter the pleasure of his visit. At concert, ball, and opera, no lover was ever more assiduous in his attentions to his lady-love than was Mrs. White to her daughter if Mr. Kemper was present. Annoyed in this manner, his visits became less frequent, and as Edith Shelley, though not the rose, literally dwelt near it, he gradually learned to devote to her the attention that had once been Kate's exclusively; leaving the latter (guarded on either side by her mother and Mr. White) to look on in passive pain while he rode, drove, danced, and promenaded   LEFT TO HERSELF.        53 with her who seemed happiest among women, Edith Shelley. Once, it had seemed that Kate and Edith were cement- ing that somewhat precarious connection which comes of woman's friendship for woman; but suddenly the former became cold, distrait, formal; while her fi-iend, uncon- scious of the cause, because ignorant of the relations ex- isting between Kate and Mr. Kemper, resented the change and adopted a similar demeanor. Mr. Kemper so little doubted Kate's affection that it never occurred to him she could lose faith in his love for her; and, being ignorant of the estrangement which had taken place between her and Edith, he would not have deemed it necessary, even had he found an opportunity, to make an explanation of his conduct. Frank Muncair, already prejudiced against Edith, imagrined that, in regard to Kate and Mr. Kemper, she was playing the part of a traitor and a flirt, and, being one of Miss Manning's oldest friends, excused himsblf on this supposition for the indulgence of his increasing dis- like. Edith was not unmindful of the observant eye and curved lip with which he regarded her while receiving Mr. Kemper's attentions, nor was she patient of what she- justly deemed his impertinence; she affected therefore to ignore the fact 0f Mr. Muncair's existence, and redoubling her apparent enjoyment of Mr. Kemper's society, uncon- sciously redoubled also the pain that so often drove the roses from Kate's cheek and the smile from her lips. One day Frank drew from his friend a confession of her unhappiness and the history of her relations with Mr. Kemper. His next step was to recount the same to Edward Bertnord, and request him to test the generosity of his friend Miss Shelley by confiding to her also a rela- tion of the circumstances. Without hesitation, Edward 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7897-00000028"/> 54       LEFT TO HERSELF. promised to do so, and on the same day carried his pur- pose into execution. That evening-on the plea' of indisposition-Kate passed in her own room, where, seated at her window, overlooking Mr. Shelley's garden, she thought tearfully of her life as compared with that of Edith. The moon was at its full, and, sailing through an un- clouded sky, bathed the earth with a radiance almost as searching as that of day; therefore, when two figures emerged from Mr. Shelley's house and slowly prome- naded the garden-walks, Kate had no difficulty in recog- nizing Edith and Mr. Kemper. Her hand rested on his arm, and at first they wandered among the different paths, but, becoming more absorbed in the evidently earn- est conversation, at length confined themselves to one, and walked back and forth for more than an hour. At last Kate heard the ring of the door-bell, and a ser- vant informed Miss Shelley of the arrival of visitors. She aid Mr. Kemper stood talking a few moments longer, then he took her hand, and, saying a few earnest words, bent down and kissed it. They re-entered the house; and Kate, still sitting at her chamber window, listened to a fountain which seemed babbling of the high destiny of its mistress. Thle next morning Kate had just told Mr. Muncair of the interview she had witnessed on the previous evening, when Edith Shelley was announced. She and Frank, often as they had met in society, had never been intro- duced, but now the ceremony was not to be avoided, and, with some embarrassment, Kate went through with it. Byron told Leigh Hunt that on one occasion Rogers said something so exquisitely equivocal that he could not notice it, but, added the gloomy Childe, "I could have killed him at the moment."  So felt Edith Shelley, as, \   L EF TO HERSELF.        55 through all the polite deference assumed by the gentleman, was still apparent the dislike of the man; but it was too indefinitely shown to be visibly resented, so she returned his low bow with one half haughty, half nonchalant, and was forced to be content. Kate, uncomfortably conscious that she had been cen- suring Edith, was so silent and constrained that Mr. Muncair determined to remain until she should have re. covered herself. He had then intended leaving, but, fancy- ing in one of Miss Shellev's remarks that the missile of wit was directed at himself, he retorted, she followed up his reply, and, both being foud of repartee, the war lasted some time. Finally be rose, and, in replyto some retort from her, exclaimed, laughing, "Oh, hbolvenonous is the tongue of a woman!"Bowing "low to the ladies, he withdrew. Edith then asked Kate to take a drive with her, and on entering the carriage said to the coachman, "Drive for an hour where we shall not meet everybody." After a pause, she turned to her companion and said, "Kate, I hope you will not think me impertinently in- quisitive if I ask your confidence in regard to Mr. Kemper. I had a long conversation with him last night, and prom- ised to be his and your friend to the utmost extent of my power; to serve you both at any time, in any manner, under any circumstances. He told me to tell you how miserable he is, and how he longs to see you alone once again." Poor Kate I She burst into tears, and exclaimed, "Oh, Edith, how I have wronged you! and him too I I saw you last night " "I know you aid; the moon was shining in at your window." "Oh I And he-did-did he "  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7897-00000029"/> 56       LEFT TO HERSELF. "He said, ' God bless her sweet face!' and wished to make some signal to you, but I feared that others might observe it; and with reference to yourself, he and I must not appear to act in concert, or we shall be unable to outmanceuvre your mother, which, if you will excuse the confession, is what we propose attempting. ' After a long conversation they returned to Mrs. White's. "Well, young ladies, you have taken a lengthy drive," said the mistress of the house. "Where have you been P Shopping? visiting?" "Oh, Mrs. White," Edith exclaimed, "you should see some of those superb silks at 's1 I find it impossible to make a selection. The fact is, I so dislike shopping alone that I rarely go at all. I should be delighted if you would occasionally allow me to join you and benefit in my selections by your taste and judgment." "Nothing would afford me more pleasure, I assure you, Miss Edith. Whenever you wish to go, you have only to inform me of your desire." "Oh, thank you!" was the answer. "Shall I be im- posing on your kindness if I say to-morrow?" "Not at all," said Mrs. White. "Kate, you will go too, dear?" "No, mother," said Kate. "I do not intend making any purchases, and cannot assist you; so allow me to decline." "I shall not leave you, love, a whole morning. You must go with us," "Do, Kate," said Edith, " or be an angel to my aunt, and relieve her loneliness." "That will do, dear. You will spend the morning with Mrs. Shelley. Yes. I am sure you would be lonely without me, and Nicholas, you know, is out of town."   LEFT TO IIERSELF.        57 At twelve o'clock the next morning, Edith bore Mrs. White victoriously away, leaving Kate with Mrs. James Shelley. Ten minutes after twelve, Mr. Kemper and his lady-love were enjoying a quiet tete-d-tete in the parlor which Mrs. Shelley bad vacated, in accordance with an intimation from Edith that such would be the more agreeable course of proceeding, especially if followed by silence regarding the circumstance. The present from Edith of a handsome set of laces inclined Mrs. White to high good humor, and she advised Kate to cultivate an intimacy with the donor. "You are poor," she said; "Edith Shelley is rich and generous. She will hesitate in making handsome presents only lest she wound your pride; but let her know you well enough not to fear that. Pride is too costly a mantle for Poverty, and poor protection against the rough winds of everyday life. Exchange it for a humble but more use- ful covering." Thus Edith literally bought interviews for Mr. Kenmper and his betrothed, but without a suspicion on their part of this generosity on hers ; for Kate betrayed such shame of the ignoble character her mother seemed disposed to assume, that she was no longer kept apprised of Edith's liberality. Edward Bertnord, without comment, informed Frank of Edith's kindness toward Kate and Mr. Kemper. "It seems, then, that I have done her injustice," said Mr. Muncair; " and, to tell the truth, she was so-I will say haughty, but insolent should be the word-so haughty when we met that she delighted me. Society has been salmagundi without spice ever since. Let us call." "She will not admit you," said Edward, quietly. "She says so, does she? Singing is her forte; why   &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7897-00000030"/> 58       LEFT TO HERSELF. doesn't she learn an old song which advises that you don't say no before you are asked?" "She has never said anything about it or you, that I am aware of; but, by your own account, you have acted impertinently toward her, and I know her well enough to be sure that she will resent it." "We shall see," said Frank. The gentlemen called, and as they sat in the parlor . while the servant took their cards to Miss Shelley, Ed- ward said, "I will bet you a box of cigars that we do not see her." "Very good," said Frank; but, as they spoke, the rustle of silk was heard. Edward muttered a hasty ana- therma, rose, and bowed; but an irrepressible smile broke over his features as with great ceremony he announced that he had the pleasure of introducing his friend Mr. Muncair. They at once plunged into a discussion of the weather, and, having exhausted various topics equally exciting, came to a pause; one of amusement on the part of Mr. Bertnord, vexation on that of Mr. Muncair, and embarrassment on that of Mrs. Shelley, who discovered that decidedly she was not au fait of all that was pass- ing. Finally she said, "My niece desires to be excused this morning, but hopes you will walk into the next room and take refreshments; she says that she has reason to believe that the last of the restaurateurs died yesterday, and hopes her father's cook will be found not deficient in the duties incident to his office. I hope I have delivered the message correctly," Mrs. Shelley added, "for she would not intrust it to the servant. I suppose you gentlemen understand what she means." "' I do not, I assure you," said Mr. Bertnord. "If," said Frank, as they rose to leave,-" if I also may tax Mrs. Shelley with a message, I would ask her to re.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        59 mind Miss Shelley of a song which she has sung with much effect, and which I hope ere long to hold in even more vivid remembrance than I now do. Tell her,- ' La donna e mobile. "' Edward Bertuord did not convey by word or manner the inevitable "I told you so" of ordinary people; but Mr. Muncair said, "If she doesn't see the day when she will gladly welcome me, I am not a ' scholar nor a gen- tleman, a poet nor a man of facts.' I am half in love with her already."       ' CHAP TER   V I. MR. MUNCAIR had an aunt who attended church more indefatigably, and belonged to more benevolent societies, than any ten other women in New Orleans. She was one evening lamenting that they were about to lose their minister, when Frank, in reply, gave her so favorable an account of John Lockhart that she de- clared they must have him, and she would take the initial steps at once. This she did, and being, for various reasons, one having authority in church matters, it resulted after a time in John receiving what is termed " a call" to New Orleans. The official document was accompanied by one from Frank, in which he urged John to accept the offer and make the sweet South his home, if only to avert the break-down with which his health seemed to be threatened. The answer ran thus: "DEAR MUNCAIR,-Before giving a formal reply to the offer made me, I wish to inform myself through you in.  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7897-00000031"/> regard to one matter. I have made it the rule of my life never to enter into what are termed religious con- troversies, believing that they embitter the soul rather than advance it in knowledge or holiness; and in what I am about to say I do not mean to condemn or reflect on the conduct of other clergymen,-men better and purer and truer to their trust than I can hope to be. I merely mean that in this one thing at least I think I see the right; and in this one thing at least I will act rightly. I will not become rector of a church where the pews are rented or sold, because I believe it to be an enormous sin. There may be some free pews (free generally be- cause too uncomfortable or too conspicuous to selD, and it may be a foolish pride which keeps them empty; never- theless, as a general thing, they are empty, and the sick souls which so need a physician are left to perish. It may be very wrong to think so highly of creature com- fort that after a week's hard work men are not willing to brace themselves against a wall in the extreme end of the church during a service of two hours; yet there are men just so wicked,--men who might learn better, perhaps; but until they do, by the grace of God, learn better somewhere else, they are practically excluded. It may be a morbid sensitiveness which makes a woman's face redden when, on being taken to a pew, she is re- ceived according to the fashion of her bonnet; yet there are women just so sensitive; and these sensitive natures being most easily influenced for good or ill, it is neces- sary that they have steady guidance,-yet-you see they are excluded. Professing to preach the religion of Christ, who called to Himself the poor, the halt, the lame, the blind, I cannot say that I will preach to those only who, by some means (honorable or not, as the case may be), have made money enough to buy a seat in the   L/J"FT .I'U .E.'S'LF.;     1 temple of Jehovah, a private apartment in the house of God. Why preach to the poor? They are not there to hear. I cannot on that sacred spot tell men who are working their lives out, of the life everlasting. I can- not there tell worn women of that fair land of Eden where the weary are at rest. I cannot there tell the hourly-tempted lower classes, who through ignorance are placed most in need of counsel, how to 'suffer and be strong.' I cannot there comfort those who are so sorrowful and comfortless because they are excluded;- and having done mny part toward excluding them from the house of their Father, can Hdare Hgo -to their wretched homes and mock them with offers of his love, and brotherhood with those who say they are his chil- dren? "You may cite many reasons in favor of the system, but I am speaking of what is right, not of what is expedient. You will say that families like to sit together. Let them go in time to obtain seats near each other. Sinners are not ill such haste to hear the word of God that they will crowd the Christians out; and if they are, so much the better. Let true Christians rejoice at having to resign their seats from such a cause. You may say that the minister will often be left without his salary. I have nothing to remark on that head. Let each decide for him- self. You may say that the richer portion of the con- gregation will not be willing to mingle with the poor. Then hear me: those men and those women are whited sepulchres! They are hypocrites, or they are idiots; and because of their blindness and ignorance, thus offend God and cast reproach upon his pure cause, -taking upon themselves, for the love of fashion and from the force of custom, vows which they in no degree fulfill, and thus disgracing that which they do not even comprehend. 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7897-00000032"/> 62       L EFT TO HERSELPF.

Florence came in while he was writing, and he read her the letter. She gave a toss of the head, and beat an impatient tattoo with her foot. "John, you are absolutely morbid on that subject. I really do think clergymen make sacrifices enough without enduring voluntary starvation; and if they engage in secular pursuit, the world says they trade in dry-goods all the week and Bible texts on Sunday, and ride two maple-trees at the same----" John roared with laughter. "You mean ride both sides the sapling, don't you?" "You ought to know. It is what mischief-makers and Pharisees ride, and people who don't care whether they hurt other people's feelings or not; and it's all the same whether it's a sapling or a gooseberry-bush!"   LEFT TO HERSELF.        63 But, Florence, those old-fashioned fellows we call the apostles  " "Ridieulous!" "( Well I To call the apostles ridiculous I However, they deserve it for the frolicsome lives they led. That was a good joke, for instance, that Paul helped to play on Stephen; and he had certainly lost his sense of humor when he could not see how funny it was to take a scourging." "' You know very well I don't mean that. It is you and the pews. And I think it very strange indeed that you are willing to hurt Mr. Bryant's feelings; and I am sure father and mother go to a pewed church, and if you were to preach a thousand years in a little old church without any pews you never would be half so good as they are, and neither would anybody else. And I don't see what good you expect to do, when the best men and women in the world buy and sell pews and don't think of it at all. I don't care if that is just where the fault lies I! :No doubt they do think of it, and don't see any harm in it either." "I thought you said " "I said it was perfectly ridiculous, and so it is." John plunged his hands into his pockets, hung his head, and walked across the room; came back, paused, looked at Florence, and laughed. "That piece of logic is conclusive. No wonder you reiterate it. I love to hear a woman argue I She does it in such style that a man is bewildered, if not staggered, by the very first attack."

With us, you are all ready to use ' lungs for logic, and for brains, effrontery.' But that has nothing to do with pews. People are obliged to have pews. One man can- not be pastor and peddler too.

"I know I would not hurt dear old Mr. Bryant's feelings, and make myself disagreeable to everybody, and make people feel uncomfortable, and selfish, and hypocritical, andSbe a Pharisee, just about pews!" "Wlhy, bless my soul, Florence, is it the wood and cushions I am thinking of, or the principle involved? I am surprised at you!" "I don't care if you are!" she retorted, half crying. "I am surprised at you too, and I think you should be ashamed of yourself, when Mr. Bryant married father and mother and baptized us all, and has been just as good to you as he could be; and it's just t-he saLme as your telling him that he is a wicked old man, and you know very well he is sick." "More logic," said John. "Besides, where the pews are free, persons have their regular seats, and are just as selfish and hateful about them as if they rented them." 4   LEFT TO HERSELF.        '65 "But that is their sin, not mine. You might as well tell me not to condemn crime because men will err." "But that does not hurt anybody's feelings, because you know we all expect it. If Eutychus had owned a pew he would not have broken his back falling out of the window; and if he perched himself there because of any peculiarity like yours, I think it a great pity they brought him to life again. Besides, as I said before, how are clergymen to live? If they engage in secular pursuits, they are maligned as ministers." "Well, suppose we worship without an organ, and so save the three hundred dollars which I imagine is the smallest salary an organist would accept. Now, let us see what this three hundred can accomplish. A parson with ten children will require at least fifteen barrels of flour a year,-we will, add three for pies and birthday cakes. Eighteen barrels of flour at ten dollars a barrel will be one hundred and eighty dollars. We will allow him fifty dollars for meal, and as they must have milk to eat with their mush, the other fifty will go for a cow. We might even arrive at such a state of grace as to- pray devoutly on a bare floor, and without a pang take the Holy Communion from   a crystal goblet instead of silver." "But, John, people are willing, and feel able, to pur- chase these things for themselves, when they are entirely too poor to furnish their pastor eighteen barrels of flour at ten dollars a barrel." "Oh," said he, "if you assert that the Christian reli- gion has not strength to sustain itself, I admit the expe- diency, at least, of borrowing a crutch from Satan; but I thought only the Jesuits advocated doing evil that good might'come of it.

"But that," she replied, " was in the days of miracles." "So it seems," said John, dryly. Here is Frank's reply: "DEAR BARNABAS,-I am glad you are sap-head enough to be content with what you are likely to get. The pews, as it happens, are free, and the congrega- tion not the most fashionable, of course, or they would have reserved seats, and wouldn't have you-till you've made your mark. The upper ten won't drink at the town-pump, and you must' give them the water of life also at so much a year. I am not-crotchety on the sub- ject myself.

He does no man- ner of work on the Sabbath-day. He likes his otium, and takes it cum dignitate. There goes one commandment. It is not your concern why he doesn't break it, provided he doesn't. Why should he covet his neighbor's goods? Can't he take Smith by the nape of the neck, and sell him out and buy him in, till Smith won't know apple- jack from Hail Columbia? Check that off. Then there's murder. Why should he want to put anybody out of the way? Don't we all love him and-bow down to him and worship him?

"How- ever, when a man lords it around him, and takes bis mastership for granted, other men may want to kick him, but no woman refuses to kneel down and turn up her eyes.

CHAPTER VII. EDITH sat one day looking compassionately at Mrs. Shelley's little daughter as she carefully played with a doll too elegantly dressed to give much pleasure to its owner, should she desire to do more than look upon her possession. It was after dinner, and Edith, as she watched the little girl, sat idly marshalling a force of apricots which the servant had placed before her, or forming them into pyramids which she immediately toppled over, while her father read a newspaper, and Mrs. Shelley, in her attelmpts to be entertaining, wearied Charles with idle questions. "That is really a burlesque on play," said Edith. "Now you are beginning to talk sense," came from behind the newspaper. "You flatter me, father. Such commendation is really embarrassing to one of my retiring disposition." "I have not often had occasion to discompose you in that manner." "Or you have been slow to avail yourself of it, sir; for seldom hath been seen that conscious blush which dyes my modest cheek at faintest breath of praise." "Decidedly. Charles, are you going down now? I want to see you." "Yes, sir, I am ready. Edith, Day is coming this afternoon; says he has some amusement to propose. See him, and if there is anything in it, let us " "Father is calling. I will see Mr. Day. Mary, did you ever have a rag doll?"   LEFT TO HERSELF.        69 The child shook her head. "Don't you want one? My nurse used to make me, oh, such grand rag dolls, and I used to hate my fine doll that would break if I threw her about." "Was she like mine?" ( "Yes. I think she was this one's cousin." "An' did her clothes was so fine they kept on always gettin' hurt if you just squeezed her?" "Yes." "An' did you lay her on the floor just a minute one day, and the dog come in an' shaked her, an' treaded all over her just like she wasn't nothin', and Cousin Charlie taked you down where all the pretty bottles was, an' gived you somethin' that says ' sh-sh,' for I drinked it, an' then we went to somewhere I knowed, an' he buyed me this, an' ma gen'l'ly locks her up 'cep' some- times. " "Well, let her lock it up now, and we will go under the crabapple-tree, where the swing is, and make a doll ourselves that wont get hurt." Kate Manning and Frank Muncair were startled during a confidential interview just then in progress by the sound of the door-bell, and Kate, looking through the blinds, said it was Mrs.  , a friend of her mother, who was awaiting admittance. "Let us go into the back parlor and shut the door, then," said he. She acquiesced; and just as Mrs.   entered the front room they noiselessly retreated to a window at the end of the one adjoining, which, as we have said, over- looked Mr. Shelley's garden. Edith presently appeared, followed by Mary and Eliza, a little negro girl, who between them carried the future doll and her wardrobe.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7897-00000036"/> 70       LEFT TO HERSELF. "What are they about?" asked Frank. "She surely does not condescend to amuse children." "On the impulse of the moment she is anything- everything. I love her dearly," was Kate's somewhat irrelevant reply. But she might have been pardoned for making none, in view of the picture before her,--a picture such as can be seen only in the perfumed, "blossom-buried" month of April-the apple-tree, with its burden of fragrant flowers, the petals floatingg softly down on the tender grass as Edith reclined in the swing, and at in- tervals pressed her pretty foot against the earth, mov- ing gently back and forth, while Mary and Eliza stood on either side, intently gazing on the cloth as it was rolled up and gathered at the head in orthodox rag doll style. "Run and get me the pen and ink, Eliza, to make eyes. " Eliza came back with the ink, but said, sulkily,- "Mr. Day got to come and spile our fun. Miss Edy, let him come out here, and you go on fixin' it. I dun tole him whar you was." As in a moment became evident, for, without further invitation, he and Mr. Bertnord joined the party. They had been in conversation only a few minutes when Mr. Day discovered a friend behind the curtain of Mrs. White's parlor window, and immediately called out, "What, ho I within-there!" Kate drew aside the curtain, and Edith said, before she saw Frank,- "Oh, come down, Kate; we want you." Somewhat against her will, she was forced to add, "Mr. Muncair, will you not join us?'9 "I fear you will order refreshments," he answered.   L EFT TO 1HERSELF.       17 "Not if you repent and desire to be forgiven." "Most earnestly I do." "Come, then." "Now, Muncair," said Mr. Day, "you are the very man. Couch your lance for the honor of the stage, and propose some feasible plan for the getting up of private theatricals.' "Good my friend, an' it were left to me, I'd say do this an' that, but I am not master here." "Where's now thy wonted wit, brave Francis? Kings do rule but through their ministers. Let now thy tongue wag, and counsel wisely." "Let us have tableaux vivants, parlants, et chan- tants. Does it not promise to be a remarkable exhibition? Permit me to explain." The party entered into con- sultation, and the tea-bell rang while they were still thus engaged. "Of course," said Edith, "you will all take tea with me, and this evening we can select our company; besides, Charlie must see you. Ah, here he comes!" Charles, after a few moments' conversation, led the way into the house, but Mr. Muncair lingered beneath the apple-tree, looking through its branches at the newly-risen moon. Edith rejoined him and said, mischievously,-- "You positively will not take refreshments?" "You are unkind," he said, gravely. "Worse-I am rude. Come, or I shall not forgive myself. " "Can you forgive me? Think how idly I spoke; imagine how bitterly I have reproached myself. Not selfishy alone, and because I have forfeited all hope of your friendship, but also because of my injustice to-will you accuse me of flattery if I speak as I feel, and say- to one of the best and noblest of women?"  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7897-00000037"/> 72       LEFT TO HERSELF. "I certainly shall; so don't say it." "Tell me, then, that the gentle charity of your woman's heart finds forgiveness for--even me." A tender light was in his handsome eyes, a pleading tone in his softened voice, a persuasive smile upon his lip, as he continued, "May I hope to be forgiven?" "I forgive you, assuredly." "Fully, freely, from your heart?" "Fully, freely, from the bottom of my heart.'" A look of triumph, half a smile, half a sneer, was vis- ible on his features as he said, mentally, "La donna e mobile;" but at the moment Edith looked up and asked,- "Is the farce over? This is an early rehearsal." "Pardon me. I do not understand." "Pardon me if I state what we both already under- stand quite well: that, in the first place, I neither know nor like you well enough to be severely wounded at anything you may have chanced to say; and, in the second, that you neither know nor like me well enough to be thus eager for my forgiveness. You once exclaimed, with Hamlet, ' Words I words! words!' Am I now suffi- ciently concise and comprehensible?" "The fact does not admit of question. You are re- sentful, implacable, unwomanly." Edith smiled carelessly, and adorned her hair with apple-blossoms, as she replied,- "I like that better; it came more from the heart. Men are terribly artificial (reach me that bunch); a simple, single-minded girl like myself, who has seen nothing of the world, aid has too little self-reliance to  9? Both laughed, and a servant interrupted with,--"Mr. Bertuord says you must go without your supper if   LEFT TO0 HERSELF.        73 you don't take it now, Miss Edith." So they rejoined the party.            \ Mr. Kemper said to Edith, next day, "I cannot stand this any longer. Kate must decide between her mother and myself. You say rightly that Mrs. White's suspicions are aroused, for Kate is under constant sur- veillance, and Nicholas White is yelping out his cow- ardly existence at her feet. She had half resolved to take French leave with me, as you and I proposed,'but she is so timid and irresolute " "Oh, Thursday night, Thursday night," exclaimed Edith, "when we have tableaux, you know, I will persuade her to go off with you.

A PLATFORM had been erected; the curtain, as true love sometimes does, redeemed its character and ran smooth; all manner of costumes had been scattered through the room; and now, standing, sitting, walking, lounging, a number of gentlemen and ladies formed a merrier party than it often becomes the lot of gentlemen and ladies to make.  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7897-00000038"/> 74       LEFT TO HERSELF. Simon Day was costutned as-a bandit; fury and burnt- cork darkened his brow, while from his sneer-writhed lips issued " words mysterious." (Simon was rehearsing, you perceive.) Edith, Kate, and Frank were standing on the platform, Edward Bertnord and Charles were smoking on the porch, and the rest amused themselves as their various tastes dictated. "( Oh, bandy words!" said Frank, elevating his voice. "I thought you said something else, and were alluding to Day." "Thou whipper-snapper " exclaimed Simon, fiercely, and strode away. Some one addressed Kate, and, as she descended from the stage, Edith, turning to Mr. Muncair, inquired,- "Where can Mr. White have gone?" "Doubtless to a faro-bank," said Mr. Muncair, " where his constitutional aversion to good society always takes him when Mrs. White hasn't him in tow. By the way, where is she?" i"She is under the impression that Mr. Kemper went to Vicksburg this morning; hence her absence. How- ever, society is not unwilling to hold her absent. You remember,- "' Here lies the body of Sir John Guise: Nobody laughs and nobody cries; Where his soul is and how it fares, Nobody knows and nobody cares."' "That may answer for the nephew, but would be too complimentary to the aunt. Is not this more apropos?- "If Heaven rejoice when sinners cease to sin, If Hell rejoice when sinners go therein, d If Earth rejoice whenever it lose a knave, Then all rejoice, for she is in her grave. "   LEFT TO HERSELP.         75 "Verily," said Edith, "these be parlous words." "We are told," said Mr. Muncair, "that the mother of Didymus Dumps, being a layer-out of the dead, con- sidered herself a hyphen between time and eternity. Now, this fellow White seems to me a hyphen between wealth and poverty, The man has so much riches of one kind and so little of another, that each time I contem. plate the person in whom these extremes meet I am newly vexed. But as it is better that ninety-nine guilty should escape than one innocent man be condemned, so is it less painfill to see wealth, honor, position given to many who cannot appreciate them, than to see one opu- lent soul dragging through life its poverty-stricken body. Heighol I occasionally feel that I had rather be a hewer of wood and a drawer of water than--- "A mere gentleman?"' "Yes, Miss Edith; it is sometimes mortifying to re- flectkthat one is, as you say, a mere gentleman." A storm approached, and it came royally, heralded by bursts of thunder that made the earth reel, and darts of livid lightning that made the more timid draw closer together and ask in whispers, "Is it not fearful?" Masses of cloud, heavy and black, slowly spread them- selves across the face of heaven; trees wildly tossed their arms and bowed their heads as if to sue for mercy firom a coming foe ; birds flew circling around each other, then with bewildered cries disappeared, while clouds of dust were tossed and rolled before the hurrying wind. Edith, going to a window, immediately burst into a peal of laughter, which drew Charles and Edward to her side. Looking out, they descried Nicholas White racing furiously up the street, his hat rolling before him, waiting now and then for him to get within a yard of it, then bounding away as though Asmodeus were after it.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7897-00000039"/> 7t6      LEFT TO HERSELF. Quite ian excusable error on the part of Nick's hat, by the way, though the general behavior of these useful articles on occasions like the present is totally inexcusable; for, save lovely woman, there is nothing under the universal dome that can be so aggravating and so absolutely given up to evil spirits as a hat running before the wind. Nick's yellow locks streamed far behind, and the skirts of his coat were straightened as though invisible demons were holding them and pulling the owner back, while ever and anon he shut and rubbed his stupid eyes, reddened and smarting with flying dust. Just as he caught sight of the group at the window, some charitable hand captured the runaway hat, and a few moments later Nick was ushered into the presence of our friends. A lurid gash across the face of heaven, a crash, a tremor, and the mighty torrent leaped from the clouds upon the crouching earth. Rain dashed wildly against the windows and through the gutters, and formed minia- ture rivers in the garden-walks, Liliputian insects met death on dwarfish oceans, and leaves torn from the boughs were tossed a moment high in air, then beaten down again. "There is a story," said Edith, "of an Invisible Bell hung high in heaven, which, when man commits the unpardonable sin, is tolled by angel hands. Thunder always seems to me the tolling of that bell; millions of angels hover around, and we call their tears rain, while the lightning-what is it?" "It is a fiery chisel," said Charles, " hewing on the granite front of Eternity the sentence of condemnation." "It is a gleam of triumph from the devil's eyes," said Mr. Bertnord; "and we speak of the moaning of the wind when we hear him howl from having climbed a cloud too high and been electrified by unexpected con-   LEFT TO HERSELF.         7 tact with his auld acquaintance the angels-what we call a shocking accident." "Henceforth," said Frank, "the man is abandoned to the devices of his own heart and the counsels of the Tempter.  The 'heavens are hung with black;' the moaning breath of a million angels rushes past; birds and beasts conceal themselves; man is cowed; all nature shrinks and trembles, and at each peal of that mighty tongue the tears fall heavier and faster, for it tells that a soul is lost!" For awhile all listened in silence to the roar of the storm. Then Mr. Muncair turned to Edith and asked, "Don't you remember what Friar Pacificus says?- 'I hear the thunder Mutter its curses on the air, The Devil's own and only prayer.' "But," he continued, with a sudden laugh, "look at that fellow in the centre of the room "7 All eyes were immediately directed toward Nicholas White, who had removed his chair as far as possible from window, door, and chimney, and now sat with feet hung to its rounds by means of his boot-heels, knees touch- ing each other, and feet as far apart as the size of the chair would permit. At each thunder-clap he exclaimed, and started, and never failed to insist that some one should inform him whether it were not loud,-the loudest he or she had ever heard; whether each flash were or were not the brightest ever seen; and whether they did not think it must have struck somewhere. At some dis- tance sat Kate, very much f :ightened, but persistently refusing Mr. White's invitation to bring her chair be- side his, and "get out of harm's way." Nearer, was Miss Brown, ever and anon getting up a scream, 7*  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7897-00000040"/> 78       LEFT TO HERSELF. "the cry of women, good my lord,"-and placing before her eyes (unconsciously, of course) the hand on which she wore diamonds. Judging from the elaborate efforts to reassure her, and the looks of amusement interchanged by the persons near, it must have occurred to them that Miss Brown was a relation of the gentleman we read of in "Ten Thousand a Year," who took prussic acid, and shuffled off his mortal coil with a peppermint-drop in its mouth. His name was Gammon. "Charlie!" called out Simon Day, "Charlie, give us a song! we've been dull long enough. The storm is nearly over; there is the sun grinning through the ragged clouds, like a country bumpkin peeping through the seam of a circus tent." Charles answered from the stage: "Mr. Muncair is the only man I ever knew who could sing bass to thunder. Call on him." "Hear! hear!" "Wait till he sings." Frank came to the front of the stage. "Ladies and gentlemen, we are all so unfortunate as to have pledged ourselves to be entertainiang and amusing to the extent of our capacity; but I do hereby avow, aver, assert, affirm, asseverate, and declare my utter inability to com- ply with this demand; and I feel very sure that no one among you who remembers and loves Tom Hood, will make a man sing merely because he happens to be 'down in the bill.'  Bowing, he retired. Those who wondered whether Tom were the papa of the immortal Red Riding Hood, remained prudently silent; while those who were better informed, to prove that they were, readily excused Mr. Muncair, and he took quiet possession of his seat. Charles, being again called upon, advised the author   "EIET TO HERSELF.       79 of the request to remove to a region not "unknown to fame ;" then sighed, yawned, came forward, and sang. Thursday night had arrived, and so had those who were to take part in the tableaux, but the spectators had not yet assembled. Frank had just written Florence a long letter full of love, and now found Edith so beautifu that he followed her with the devotion of that little star which goes about with the moon. As they sat on a lounge at the back of the stage, "I wonder," said he, "if vou were ever in love?" "I have been a schoolgirl," she replied. "Which is equivalent to saying you have loved. But since that susceptible period?" "Have I not since then known Mr. .Muncair?'" "Will you be serious and say you have not wholly disliked him?" "His warmest admirer being present, I decline an- swering!" He laughed. "Can it be that you allude to Mr. Mun- cair himself? How extremely sarcastic! and to me of all men living! You certainly forget, when you speak so heartlessly, how entirely my being is consecrated to your worship; with what absorbing devotion I regard the uttermost tip of the smallest ribbon you wear. Ah I you have never loved. ' Would that I could claim exemption From all the bitterness of that sweet name.'" "I am astonis]ed I What but an ecstasy of admira. tion for Mr. Muncair can he have inferred from my first remark? He mistook the spirit of my words." "In good faith, then, like your own, I reply. Oh,  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7897-00000041"/> 80       LEFT TO HERSELF. Queenly fair I a sense of my unworthiness doth chill my lips, yet will I essay to thank thee. My gratitude shall be enduring as the rainbow; eternal as the crescent moon; undying as the perfume of the rose; the violet's perfume shall no longer live, nor yet the note of song upon the waters." "Edith, I wish to speak with you a moment." She arose, and Frank sat indolently looking after her as she walked toward her aunt. "Oh, thou merry knave of hearts, come hither l" said a voice at his elbow. J   "Nay, wherefore, lordly Simon?" asked Frank, turn- ing to Mr. Day, who had accosted hilm. "Prithee, good sir," continued the first speaker, "canst spare thy Hyacinthine locks?"? "What mean'st thou, noble Simon?" "Delilah smiles, O Samson When sirens sing, then lash thee to the masts of prudence; when at the mouth of famed Inferno, bear in thy hand the golden branch of common sense. Addio!" "One moment halt, thou man of mystery!" "Say on, Muncair; but haste thee; for a brimming bowl awaiteth in the land of spirits, and I may not tarry; nor yet delay to burn Habana incense to the royal moon. Say on, good sir." "Thou call'dst me Samson!" "I called thee Samson.  Wherefore not call thee Samson?

"( Out upon thee, thou vile punster! Does thy grandam live? Then should she minister a birch-wood blister, and the salve of nocturnal repose, for the teaching of better manners. But seriously, Frank, I shall have to take charge of the interests of my friend Miss Florence. You are already half in love with Miss Edith." "I wish I may pledge you my word if she isn't as well worth loving as any woman I ever saw I What eyes! ' Stars! very stars! And all eyes else are dead coals!' Though, by the way, I do not understand you with re- gard to Miss Lockhart." "Of course not; but about Miss Edith---" "Bah I You are jealous, Day; needlessly, too." "No doubt of that," retorted Simon; "though I am safe enough, being kicked regularly every Sunday after- noon. The heartless  " "No woman is heartless, man. You did not adopt the right plan.

"It was your own fault, Muncair, in each instance; and to resent-- " "Nonsense! Of course I was only jesting. I feel no particle of resentment toward her. Let us go in front; the room is crowded, and I see they are ready for the first tableau." The curtain rose, displaying a man apparently asleep,-   &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7897-00000042"/> his candle flickering in the socket, and an  book lying open at his feet, while, reaching over him, another was seen stealthily securing the valuable articles strewn around. For a moment no one knew what it meant, but a burst of laughter and applause followed when the musicians behind the scene played as the illustration, "Still so gently o'er me stealing." In the next the man had awakened and seemed giving the alarm, while the band played an air-from Robert le Diable. "Robbair Rob- bair!" guessed some one of the audience; whereupon a struggle ensued, and the robber, knocking down his op- ponent, went off singing, "You'll remember me." The next was a magistrate's office, where the parties again met, and the robber's victim chanted, lustily, "Oh, yes, I remember "Officers entered and handcuffed the thief, to the tune of "Come o'er the billow, ride on the wave," and he left, tunefully suggesting that "Farewell, fare- well is a mournful sound." The curtain rose again. Dining sumptuously sat a gentleman, while peering through the window Harry as a beggar-boy sang, wistfully, "Would I were with thee." A party of young men then occupied the table, drinking, laughing, etc., while with children in their arms and wives at their elbows stood a couple of married men, dolefully humming, "Joys that we've tasted." "Kate, for Heaven's sake come on I We thought you had decided 1" "Oh, Edith, I am so frightened!" "I tell you, come  Mr. Kemper and Charles are waiting. If you ever had any self-control, exert it now." "I will; but oh, Edith, if mother should see me, I should die! Oh, I am-what shall-I do?' Frightened thoroughly she evidently was.   "If you love Mr. Kemper, come I If you love Nich- olas White, stay I There is the last tableau. Your childishness has lost us precious moments. It is per- haps too late now." "Oh, don't say that!" and Kate burst into tears. "How can you be so cruel? Please let us make haste I This way?" As the curtain rose on the funeral ceremonies of the two married women, and their husbands joyfully shook hands, singing, "We may be happy yet," Mrs. White observed her nephew in conversation with Miss Brown, but could nowhere discern Kate. Instantly vague sus- picions were aroused, and she hurriedly left the room, entering the hall at one end as Kate and Edith were about running across the other. "My mother!" gasped Kate, and leaned almost faint- ing on Edith. The latter dragged her into the portico, whispering, "Say you are already married. Eliza, quick; tell the gentlemen to come and say they are married!" "What is the matter with Kate?" asked Mrs. White. "The recent agitation has been too much for her," said Edith. "She was married ten minutes ago in my room, and her husband has gone to order a carriage to take her away." Mrs. White, choked with anger and amazement,- glared from one to the other. "Here is Mr. Kemper now. I have told Mrs. White how you were mOfried, and--. Charles, help Kate to the carriage--quick 1--go, Mr. Kemper 1" They took the hint and the lady, and were hurrying down the garden-walk, when Mrs. White attempted to shake off Edith's hand, and said, furiously; "Girl, are you deranged? Am I a child? Are there no laws?  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7897-00000043"/> Kate I Kate / Edith Shelley, let me go I KATE I Woman, I'll kill you! Let me go, I say 1" In an agony of fear, lest she should not be able to keep Mrs. White back long enough for them to get to the carriage, Edith clasped her arms around Mrs. White's waist, and was hanging there, a dead weight, when Mr. Muncair appeared. Instantly the ludicrous posture of affairs presented itself to her mind; her arms slightly relaxed their hold, Mrs. White started off, but, again . forgetting all save friendship, Edith bounded after her down the walk, catching up, as she went, a jumping-rope of Eliza's, and,-oh that I should live to tell it!-with a trick that every schoolgirl knows, she lassoed Mrs. White I Kate was placed in a carriage; Charles and Mr. Kem- per followed. Mrs. White screamed with rage, Edith with laughter, while Frank's cigar dropped from between his teeth, and he leaned against a tree, powerless, except to utter exhausting "Ha I ha's!" The carriage disappeared around the corner, Mrs. White's shrieks grew fiercer, and Mr. Shelley presented himself. To say that he was amazed, astounded, shocked, so poorly expresses the state of his feelings that I prefer simply to remark that he was surprised and not particu- larly gratified. A dead silence fell upon the party. Then Mrs. White -well, Mrs. White explained herself. Quite forcible, and to the purpose, too, were Mrs. White's remarks. Her words stood not upon the order of their coming, but came at once. "I can arrange the matter, madam. They were too late for the last boat, and.-let me see: yes, it is twenty minutes before the next will leave. Come, madam," turn- ing to Edith, "I always thought your mind unsound. Now I know you to be a lunatic!"   L,'T T'U W ' E'ys'-Lh F.    85 "I don't think you ought to have Kate brought back,' said Edith. "Was your opinion asked? Go in, and behave your- self." Frank offered her his arm, and they went into the supper-room, which had just been thrown open. An hour afterwards Charles sent word to Edith to come out on the piazza. She went; and, as they seated themselves on the step, he said, "Well, Kate has come back to the tune of ' Hark I I hear the sweet voice of my mother.'" "You don't mean to say that she has come home with Mrs. White?" "I do mean exactly that. What the-what kept you two so long? We missed the only tolerable opportunity." "Kate's miserable indecision, of course. She never had a great deal of sense to be frightened out of; but every particle deserted her to-night," said Edith, angrily. "Oh, yes, she has sense enough; it is resolution she needs." "In the morning her decision was made to go. When the last moment came, she frittered it away in objections that had been argued down already." "Go over to her now. Poor thing, she needs a friend." "I shall not, indeed I She has disappointed me. I have an utter contempt for such weakness of character." "Do not be unkind, Edith. Kate is miserable enough now. " "It is useless to discuss the matter, for Mrs. White would not admit me." And as she described the garden scene, Charles agreed that any present attempt to see Kate would prove fruitless. On the afternoon of the next day trunks were brought down and placed in a baggage-wagon, while Kate, fur- tively glancing toward Edith's chamber window, took her , 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7897-00000044"/> place in the carriage with her mother and Mr. White, and the trio drove off to the station. About three weeks later Frank called to see Edith. "I came to say good-by. I am going away to-morrow." Her change of color, slight though it was, did not escape his practiced eye, and as she asked where he was goingr, he left his chair for a seat beside her on the sofa. "To Virginia; to some of her springs, I suppose. They are not worse than other places which do not hold the people you like best. Have a moment's charity, and say you will miss me, if ever so little." "I shall not have time to miss you a great deal; we also leave next week. You will not think of me again until October, when perhaps we shall meet once more." "Edith Hpardon me, but--nt think of you, Miss Edith? If I could hope that you would willingly grant me even that beggar's privilege, I should be rich, at least in gratitude." "It would pain me very much were you to forget me; were I now to lose your friendship," she said. "Friendship I Why always friendship? I have not yet dared ask for more. Good-by. Give me both hands and look straight in my eyes, and say you will not forget me." "I will not." He took her hands and looked at her. "You will not what? Say it alL" "I will not forget you." "Do you dislike me now?" "No." "Do you like me?" "Yes." "Say so."   L:EFT' T'O HERSELF.       87 "I like you, Mr. Muncair." "Where are you going this summer?" "To Niagara and the lakes. I have seen much of Europe and little of my own country." "May I write to you?" "Yes." "Will you write to me?" "Yes." "Thank you. Good-by, Eliodora." "Good-by." And then he went. And then followed that blank, which in its negativeness can never be described, for while all things retain their color and their form, their aspect is no longer the same; and the atmosphere-bah I thermometers and baromeo ters have nothing to say in the matter. She loved him. CHAPTER     IX. "ORBURG again. Lorburg; Florence; walks; rides; drives; boating; renewal of old associations; fading remembrance of Edith Shelley. "Out of sight, out of mind," was Frank's unacknowledged motto. Truly she had enchanted him for a time, captivated his fancy, pleased his intellect, piqued his vanity, roused him to exertion, and eventu-: ally smoothed the ruffled plumes of amour-propre; but his love for Florence was of a more elevated nature. He felt that it is not beneath the dignity of a man to be ster- ling as well as brilliant; to be sincere as well as gallant; to be kind, however witty ; to be reverent, however gay.   &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7897-00000045"/> 88       LEFT TO HERSELF. And it is not surprising that Florence thought of him more highly than he deserved, for while within the sphere of her influence he was really a better man. She never "talked religion," and she had an abundance of lfaults, but she so sincerely loved God, and so honestly endeavored to keep her soul pure enough for His eye to look upon, that she unconsciously kindled to some extent like feelings in those around her. And Frank Muncair! Ah I how she loved him and trusced in him I How she exalted and looked up to him! How assured she felt of perfect happiness so long as he should love her! Kneeling, she thanked God for this crown jewel of her life, this golden thread in the web of her ex- istence. But she did not find in Frank her own singleness of heart. He had been but a few days in Lorburg when he received a letter from Edith Shelley. It pleased him. Her gay descriptions amused him; her allusions to various occurrences in Nlew Orleans awakened pleasant memories ; and certain peculiarities of expression brought her so vividly before him that he transmuted three cigars into smoke rings while recalling the hours he had passed in her society, and concluded by wondering how any one could live forever in Lorburg. He answered the letter immediately; but conscience whispered, as he formed his signature, "Would you like Florence Lockhart to see this? A man must at least think he loves the woman to whom he sincerely writes such a letter. Would you have Florence believe that you love her cousin?" "Pshaw " said Inclination. "Edith Shelley perfectly understands this style, but Florence might not; and who can be sure what she would think about it? Who can be sure what any woman will think about anything? Besides, I have avoided talking about the Shelleyvs or   LEFT TO HERSELF.        89 seeming to have been too much within the sphere of Edith's attraction; so to tell Florence anything about-it now would look like confessing, and probably make her jealous, which would be a most absurd thing. Very inconvenient, too, because, though I, of course, love Flor- ence, and shall love my wife more than any woman living, I certainly shall not renounce the world altogether, with its pleasant pomps and vanities (and wicked works, said Conscience); and I see no reason for renouncing the friends who contribute to these innocent pleasures. If I were married, I would not write to her at all, because a married man must regard the opinions of the world and the feelings of his wife; but in this instance there can be no feeling, unless-unless Florence should happen to know of the letter. It is pleasant to write to Edith, and cannot harm Florence ; so, long life to postmasters 1" * One evening Mr. Muncair called to take Florence to a party. When she came in, she walked up to him and asked, half in jest, half in earnest, "Am Hdo I look- do you like me?"She was so beautiful, as Voltaire said of some lady, that he rose before her like a point of ad- miration; and for a moment Frank was silent, so far as words were concerned, then exclaimed, enthusiastically, "Like you, Florence? like you, my own darling? To say that I don't like anything else sounds so like slang that I decline making the assertion; but I vow you are the only woman in the world!" "Oh, thank you!" she answered, with a happy laugh. "I did not mean to extort anything quite so extravagant. The carriage is at the door." During the evening Dr. Thornton devoted himself with such assiduity to a neglected maiden that Frank mentally voted him worthy of canonization, and went up to relieve him. ,8*  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7897-00000046"/> 90       LEFr TO HERSELF. "^Mv dear Thornton, you are the most selfish man in the world. I have been two hours and a half trying to catch your eye, that I might induce you gracefully to resign your fortunate position; but if you do not take yourself off now I will remove you vi et armis. Miss Fanny, you are faint for a glass of water: do commission our friend to bring it." "Why, Muncair," returned the doctor, with a grateful pressure of the arm, "I thought I had secured this seat. Go back to the office now, like a good fellow, and write another of those voluminous letters wherewith you entertain Miss 'what's her name? The New Orleans beauty. Make him tell you about Miss Selby, Miss Fanny; and I assure you he will wax eloquent." "Miss Selby?" said Florence to herself, and looked for a moment wistfully and inquiringly into Frank's face. He answered her with a smile, and said, mentally, "Con- found the fellow I He deserves to stay here and be bored for the rest of his days." The next morning Florence and John Lockhart were returning from a visit to one of his sick parishioners, when they remarked a crowd of negro boys playing at marbles, among them Dr. Thornton:s Joe, and, lying on the curbstone near him, a letter. As Florence passed, her dress swept aside the letter, and Joe sprang after it, muttering that he " wished white folks knowed whar to walk." "What's that, sir?" asked John. "Nothin', sir. I just said please'm not to git de letter dirty, if she please, marm; 'cause I got to take it to de pos'-office." "Why don't you take it, then?" asked John. "'O ause, sir, I had de money to pay for it an' to git more stamps, and I done loss it."   LEFT TO HERSELF.        91 "Lost it where you found those cakes, didn't you? Hand me the letter." John placed a stamp on it, and said to Florence, "Why, where did Thornton make Edith Shelley's ac- quaintance?" "I don't know, indeed." "Can't you gimme a heap more o' dem red-heads, so I needn't sav nothin' to Mr. Munkear 'bout de monev?" "To whom?" asked Florence. "Who sent the letter?" "Mr. Munkear, marm." "Let me see it." She recognized the writing and returned the letter. "Strange that he never mentions my cousin!" she thought. "Miss Selby? I misunderstood Dr. Thornton. He said Shelley. " Her cheeks were flushed; her lips quivered. Her talk was of gruel and the sick man. That evening a gay boating-party was en route toward Julep Font, a pretty glen, about two miles above Lorburg. It was a charming picture. On one side, the expanse -of emerald water,-the background of willows on the other, a level road crowning the grassy slope which led to the river's edge; jutting over that, immense cliffs, alive with trees and wild flowers; the boat, with its gayly-dressed ladies and their cavaliers; and all-hills, rocks, trees, willows, boat, and rosy clouds-reflected in the water. Florence sat leaning over the side- of the boat, that the water might flow against her hand. One of the company was playing on the guitar, another on the flute; the rest were singing. Frank said, in an undertone, to Florence, "You are silent this evening. Whither have your thoughts flown?" She replied that her thoughts were of the place, but not  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7897-00000047"/> 92   .LEFT TO HERSELF. with the party; that she had been there many times with her cousin, Charles Shelley; had Mr. Muncair ever heard her speak of him? Mr. Muncair believed he had; by the way, he had sometimes met with him in New Orleans; he seemed very much of a gentleman, and quite popular. "Do you know his sister?" asked Florence. Frank remembered Dr. Thornton's allusion of the night before, and determined to ward off suspicion if Florence were disposed to entertain any. He answered, care- lessly, "Oh, pretty well, I suppose. That is, I dance with her occasionally, and may have sent her a bouquet." "Why have you never told me of her? You forget she is my cousin." "I never think of other women when you are present." "Where are they now--she and Charles?" "I think they proposed going to Niagara or the North Pole. As my thoughts were all of Virginia, you will excuse--  "Hush, please!" she exclaimed; and an expression of pain crossed her features. "What is the matter? Are you ill?" ".Thank you, I am well,--only disappointed. I tried to grasp that star that trembles in the water like a bright hope in the heart,-but reality exists in heaven alone. The thought pained me for a moment, as I held the hand- ful of water cold and dull." He looked intently at her. "What is the thought behind that speech? What induces moralizing just now, my lady Florence?" "There were two arrizres-pens6es. I was reflecting, in the first place, on Joe's eminent fitness for the office of carrier-dove; and, in the second, on the shortness of your memory. Why, even I have not forgotten since this morning that Edith Shelley is at Saratoga."   LEFT TO HERSELF.        93 A crimson tide rushed up into his face, and for a moment he was silent. "List to the pensive croaking of the twilight frog," laughed some one, and for a few seconds all were quiet- while shadows grew thick among the cliffs, and the-'wil- lows swayed to the soft; sweet breeze, and the stream grew cool and dark, and theboat fled swiftly on. Never in his life had Frank Muncair been so mortified or so angry,-mortified at seeming to have acted treach- erously, and angry, inexpressibly angry, with himself, with Florence, with Edith, and with Joe; with every- body and with everything. But the silence gave him time for reflection. Never in her life had Florence been so unhappy.  Every moment of silence seemed to bring fresh condem- nation, and bitter thoughts thronged fast into her heart. Had he, then, amused himself with her while the world of real feeling was filled with the image of one more beau- tiful, more accomplished, in every way her superior? And--oh, most bitter thought!-had she lavished the deepest and purest and holiest feelings of a lifetime on one who was either too vacillating to be true, or too deceitful to be trusted? "Music! music!" urged some one. At length he said, "I How that letter came into your possession I cannot tell. What induced-how you ex- cused to yourself the unworthy act of reading it, I am at- a loss even to imagine'; but I will not speak of that. I have loved, I do love you most dearly and tenderly. Edith Shelley has no share in my affection, though my attentions and correspondence may have seemed to sanc- tion the impression." "Having sent her a bouquet and danced with her oc- , casionally?"  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7897-00000048"/> "      LEFT TO HERSELF. "This tone-these words to me?   Oh, Florence I Florence! who has taught you this? Who has stabbed me in the dark? What if I have admired Edith Shelley? Was--" ' It is not that. If you had loved her, and told me so, I should, at least, have esteemed you honest. I have neither right nor inclination to prevent your paying attention to other women; but concealment implies wrong and involves deceit, and you have deceived me about Edith Shelley." "Florence, you are unjust and harsh. What if I did make love to your cousin? What if I did flatter and affect to think of her to the exclusion of all others? Can it be possible that you do not know how little I care foi her or any woman living save yourself? Can you doubt the spirit in which that letter was written? Can you believe that, from me, words of love spoken to her bear the same significance--" "Stop a moment, if you please," she said. It was growing dark. City lights were becoming visi- ble in the distance, and a soberer mood had fallen upon the party. Five minutes before, Florence Lockhart's face had been full of struggling emotions pain and hope, jealousy and love; now she looked pale, and proud, and cold. Nothing more. "Stop a moment, if you please, while I correct an error into which you have fallen. I did not read that letter. You have yourself informed me of its nature. You are deceiving one of us. It may be myself. Our engage- ment can exist no longer." "Florence!" he exclaimed, leaning eagerly forward. At the moment she drew from her finger their engage- ment ring and dropped it into the river. Down, down it sank through the dark water, never more to touch the   LEFT TO HERSELF.        95 hand that had worn it so proudly, never more to say, with its gentle pressure, "love, trust, hope;" down it sank, with its burden of memories, to rest forever among the desolate river-stones. Frank looked sternly and bitterly at the woman he loved, then folded his arms, and leaned back in silence. The pain in her heart was whispering, "God is not good." Then memory came with keen reproaches, and recalled the happy life that God had given her, with but this pang. "The joy of it all was not worth this; truly He hath forgotten his mercy and truth toward me ;" and her heart refused to pray. The night passed slowly and painfully to both. On the following morning he went to see her. She felt that she could not place her former faith in him, yet feared to risk an interview, and, to avoid it, was going out to drive, when she met him in the hall. He looked gravely at her agitated features, and requested a moment's con- versation. "Excuse me, Mr. Muncair, I have an engagement. "I will detain you only a few moments, Miss Florence," he said, quietly. "I am sure you will excuse me. H-I am already late." "Certainly. Allow me to escort you to the carriage. I sincerely regret that I have fallen so low in your es- teem as to be denied the privilege of a few words of farewell."  As she seated herself in the carriage, he continued, "I would not have reproached you, Florence; you have, perhaps, chosen wisely, but I have loved-I even now love-too well to forget as easily as you have done, and I could not go without once more looking on all that I regret to leave. God bless you!"He ceased abruptly, and, closing the carriage-door, walked rapidly away.  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7897-00000049"/> 96       LEFF TO HERSELF. He had gone but a short distance when "Halloo, Mun- cairl" exclaimed some one at his side, catching him roughly by the arm. Frank's brow knit angrily as he shook off the grasp and looked up. "Well, Thornton?" said he. "Down in the mouth, Muncair? I tell you what---" "Now, my dear fellow," unceremoniously interrupted Frank, "when I require anything in your possession, I will inform you to that effect,-even if I wish advice, which is so improbable that you need give yourself no concern on the subject; but never offer me anything, not even money. I will ask you for that, too, when I want it. And so, good-morning." "Hold on! where are you going?" Frank pushed his hat from his forehead, and, sinking both hands in his pockets, asked, quietly, "Do I owe you anything??" "Do you owe me anything?" No." "Then, what the deuce is it to you where I am going?" "And what the deuce is it has rubbed you up so? Kicked, by Jove!" Yielding suddenly to his rage, Frank answered by a blow on the temple, which knocked Dr. Thornton to the earth senseless. Senseless, of course,--that being a nor- mal condition which no amount of knocking could alter for better or for worse; unconscious, we should have said. Frank was walking rapidly off when confronted by a policeman, who touched his arm, and bade him consider himself under arrest. Frank shook off his hold, and said, grimly,-- "Look here, No. 1, you are white about the gills already; but you'll get whiter than that the next time   LEFT TO -HERSELF.        9 you touch me. If you want to meddle with anybody, go pick up that fool and give him some whiskey; but touch me again, and I'll break every bone in your body." Well, even among policemen all are not of the lion- heart, and No. 1, like many of our fallen race, had his weaker moments.  He wavered. Should he succor the wounded, or secure the offender? Mercy, or justice ? He gave one glance toward the motionless form extended on the ground, another at the determined face and muscular frame of him who had caused the melancholy extension. Mercy, by all means. No. 1 left. So did Frank. CHAPTER          X. LET US go back to the night of Kate's involuntary re- turn firom her soi-disant bridal tour. On that occasion Mrs. White expended much time in angry thought of Edith, then turned her reflections into another channel, and concluded by sending early next morning for her- nephew. At the beginning of the interview he appeared angry and astonished; but after an earnest monologue on her part, there gradually spread over bis countenance a smile which would have made a child shrink from him. He nodded his head quickly and repeatedly in reply to the remarks of his aunt, and soon left the house. Mrs. White then betook herself to Kate's apartment, and informed the young lady that, as she seemed de- termined to marry Mr. Kemper, it nlust be done with as little improprietv as the case would admit of; therefore he, Mrs. White, would at length yield her consent and &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7897-00000050"/> 98       LEFT TO HERSELF. provide the necessary trousseau. Kate, hardly daring to believe that she understood correctly, inquired of her mother if she had seen Mr. Kemper (he only, of all the world, could have performed this miracle), and what had induced such a change of feeling toward him. Mrs. White answered that she had now even less regard for Mr. Kemper than heretofore, but she had also too much self-respect to set herself up as a target for the slings and arrows of outrageous gossips. Hence her consent. She stipulated, however, that they should, under the escort of her nephew, immediately leave for Vicksburg, and remain there at the house of her brother until after the marriage. Mr. Kemper would, of course, follow on being informed of the change of programme. Kate dared not mention her desire to take leave of Edith, as Mrs. White protested that it was to avoid a sight of that young person's triumph that she wished to leave New Orleans; so Kate silently acquiesced, and the day after the tableaux the two left for Vicksburg, where, according to arrangement, they were joined by Mr. Kemper. Mrs. White was now in her element; her innate love of manceuvre was gratified to its fullest extent, and she was happy. In vain were Kate's remonstrances on the subject of her bridal wardrobe. She had the good taste to perceive that satin and velvet would not trail becom- ingly on the probable carpets of her future home; but Mrs. White declined yielding this point also, and persisted in the 'purchase of everything desirable for a wealthy bride. What, however, most annoyed Kate was the con- stant presence of her mother's nephew. If Mrs. White was going to the jeweler's, Nicholas was at her service; if she wished anything done, Nicholas was the man to do it; Nicholas sent things up to be looked at; Nicholas   LEFT TO HERSELF.        99 suggested alterations; Nicholas was everywhere, having something to do with everything. Another source of an- noyance was Mrs. White's habit of offering up jeremiads over every handsome addition to the trousseau; speak- ing of the whole thing as the funeral pomp of Kate's days of splendor, etc.; never failingo also to state that her opinion of Mr. Kemper remained unchanged, and that she should not be surprised at anything contemptible of which he might hereafter prove guilty. To all of which the daughter meekly submitted; only too glad that it was no worse. Kate saw Mr. -emper now almost as seldom as before they left New Orleans. Frequently when he called Mrs. White alone went down, and Kate did not know that he was in the house till he had left. Then her mother would say, "Kate, love, Mr. Kemper has been here, but I thought you had better not come down, as you must de- vote this morning to your mantuamaker, and he would have detained you too long. I told him you regretted being unable to see him." "Why did you not tell him, mother, that you had not informed me of his presence because you knew I was engaged? He will think I care very little to see him if I cannot spare him a single moment." "It is impossible to satisfy you. I did not tell him that because he knows I have once been unfriendly to his suit, and might think me still so. What a handsome- dress is this in which to receive company at your own house!-supposing for a moment that you are likely to have either house or company." Kate's face crimsoned, but she made no reply. As Kate seemed incessantly engaged, Mr. Kemper did not call-so often as at first; and Mrs. White did not fail to remark this to Kate, wondering, or rather pro-  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7897-00000051"/> 100      LEFT TO HERSELF. 'fessing not to wonder, that he was growing neglectful. Kate ventured to say it was not a matter of surprise to her, as he had so often been denied admittance. But her mother remarked that it was not so with all men. Nicho- las, for instance, was as devoted now as before his rejec- tion. She hoped Kate would not be so unjust as to blame her for Mr. Kemper's neglect; she was sure she had done everything she could for her daughter's happiness. Mr. KemlSer soon left Vicksburfg to prepare, in New Orleans, a home for Kate's reception. Her lover absent, and her mother no inexpert chirographer, it is needless to explain the artifices by which Kate's mind was poisoned and slie misled both as to the tone and frequency of Mr. Kemper's letters. Mrs. White one evening entered Kate's room and found her weeping bitterly. It was but ten days to that set for the wedding, and she had not heard from her betrothed for more than two weeks. Mrs. White's management of the mails having some influence on this position of affairs, that lady might have explained the circumstance to Kate's satisfaction; but she confined herself to the advice that Kate should have some pride and not grieve over a false lover. She painted in vivid colors the sneers and laugh- ter of their dear friends when it should become known that Miss Manningo had clung to the en(gagement till the last ray of hope was extinguished, and concluded by say- ing, "Now, my dear Kate, were I in your place, I would unhesitatingly write to him, releasing him from his en- gagement. Not as if you had supposed he had grown weary of it-pride forbid!--but as though you desired it. If he loves you still---- '"He does love me!" sobbed Kate. "I know hbe does!" "Ah!" said Mrs. White, "that of course alters the case. I thought his behavior most ungentlemanly, not a"   LEFT' TO HERSELF.        101 knowing that he had taken the trouble, or so far en- croached upon his means as to send you a letter." "You are perfectly aware, mother, that he-that I have not heard from him." "I understand now. You found your belief on the old saying that 'silence gives consent.' You wrote to Mr. Kemper to please come down and marry you on the twentieth. As he has not thought proper to reply, he will, of course, be here. Highly condescending and obliging of Mr. Kemper I but if you were never before the sub- ject of remark, you will be when every gossip in-the city can say, ' So Kate Manning is married at last in spite of the bridegroom.? I would certainly be married in spite of Sam Kemper; and if you were a girl of any spirit and self-respect, you would, at least, offer to release him. If he loves you, he will answer immediately and follow the letter in person. You astonish me, Kate That a child of mine should have so little'spirit is a mystery. Sure, you are a changeling 1" "I will write this moment," Kate said, drying her eyes. "And if he doesn't answer--I I am sure I don't care." A statement fully corroborated by the burst of tears which followed. "My love, shall I write the letter for you: to copy?" asked Mrs. White. Kate nodded assent, and tearfully listened to her mother's pen as it sped over the paper. Still seated at her desk, Mrs. White tossed the letter to Kate, and looked curiously at her while she read it. "Oh, mother, is it not too harsh?" "Let him prove that he loves you, and hereafter you can atone for it. If he cannot, he deserves it. The mail closes in twenty minutes. If you intend to copy, the letter, do so at once." 9*   &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7897-00000052"/> 102      LEFT TO HERSELF. "Oh, mother!" "If not, leave this house 1" "Do what?" "Leave the house." "Where should I go?" "I don't know, really. Your father left you some- thing, I believe; you can select your own boarding- house." "Do what?" "Hush your nonsense i copy this letter and bring your lover back if you want him. Ah I now I know you for my daughter. Be quick 1" Mrs. White mailed Kate's letter, and added one of her own : "MR. KEMPER,-I think it but just to myself to inform you that I have had no part in Kate's determination to break her engagement with you. I have never, since I gave my consent to your union, spoken to my daulghter with reference to nmarrying her cousin; but she has, of her own accord, learned to do justice to his many ad- mirable qualities, and will be married to himn on the twentieth. I proposed that the ceremony should, from respect to you, be postponed for a few weeks; but Mr. White, of course, wishes differently, and Kate asserts that any hope you may entertain had best be crushed at once. "I hope this will not destroy the feelings of esteem and friendship which have latterly subsisted between us, and that on our return to New Orleans we may often have the pleasure of seeing you. "I hardly know whether to ask you to be here on the twentieth, though the doors will, of course, be open to you as to the rest of our acquaintance.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        103 "Until noon of the twentieth, Kate will not be in the city. She leaves to-night on a visit to a relative. "Most truly, your friend, "CATHARINE WHTE." Two or three times lie read alternately Kate's letter and that of her mother; then rested his folded arms on the table before him, bowed down his head, and the after- noon wearied on. Twilicht calme. The hour when he had so often sat in that room thinking how her presence would 'gladden it; how her sunny face would brighten it. And now -- Then night came, and pityingly the pale moon lingered to gaze on that motionless figure in the silent room. On the next day he dispatched the following: { NEW ORLEANS. "Mr. Kemper's compliments to Miss Manning. In accordance with her desire he returns her ring and letters, and blegs permission to add an expression of his sincere wish for her happiness. Miss Manning, will be so kind as to present to her mother Mr. Kemper's compliments, with the assurance that his feelings toward her remain unaltered." Kate received this note in the presence of her mother, and fell fainting to the floor. Neither astonished nor alarmed, Mrs. White calmly applied the usual restora- tives. In a few moments Kate was weeping violently, while her mother, with much apparent agitation, paced the floor, heaping on Mr. Kemper most unbounded abuse. He was deceitful! false unprincipled I cowardly! He would not have dared act thus, save to a woman father-* J  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7897-00000053"/> 104      LEFT TO HERSELF. less and brotherless. She vowed she would be revenged. If she were Kate, Mr. Kemper should see that she could live without his love; that she was not dependent on him for happiness. How people would talk I Every one knew of the approaching marriage,--how they would sneer She really shuddered at the mere thought. She should be ashamed to go out. How could Kate show her face after having been cast off in this insulting man- ner? Stopping suddenly in her walk, she exclaimed, "Were I in your place, Kate, the preparations should go on, and there should be a bride despite Mr. Kemper." "No, madam. I am enough your daughter to decline forcing him into---" "I would marry the man who loves me most." "Nobody loves me." "Nicholas White does. Marry him." i"Oh, mother I I cannot! I cannot!" "Oh," repeated her mother, contemptuously, "you cannot I you cannot! Suppose you write to your run- away sweetheart and ask him to please come back or it will kill you." "I will write and ask him why he has changed; what I have done that he should i" '",Kate Manning!" exclaimed her mother, wrathfully, "I will see you in your grave first I My daughter to de- grade herself in such a manner? You shall not do it." "' Oh," murmured Kate, " if I could see him only once more I Why has he wronged me so cruelly?" Exhausted by weeping, overpowered by the volubility of her mother, heartsick, hopeless, talked down, Kate at length resisted no more, when Mrs. White urged accept- ance of her nephew's offer. "Only leave me awhile, mother. I cannot think while you talk."   "EFr TO HERSELF.        105 "There is no time for thinking. I shall not leave till you have decided." "Leave me I leave me on your own terms. Decide anything,-everything as you will; but, mother, for Heaven's sake, leave me I You know you hate him." "With reason." "I know it." Kate rose and walked up to her mother; tears stream- ing down her cheeks, and her lips nervously quivering over teeth that had never before clinched in passion. "I know itl But so help me God, if ever you or Nicholas White dare say one word against him, you shall find that in me which neither you nor I dreamed of an hour ago; and your world, the world which kicks and despises you, though you kiss the dust off its feet--" "I will never mention his name; nor shall my nephew." "He has deserted me, but he loved me once. To him I owe all the happiness--"A spasm of grief contracted her features, and sinking down on the bed, she wept like a sick, wearied child. Mrs. White stood quietly looking on, with perhaps a faint sentiment of commiseration somewhere down in her heart. "My daughter," she at length said, gently, "Miss Strange is down-stairs. She wishes to know at what hour to-morrow your invitations shall be taken out. What shall I say to her?"7 "Whatever you choose." "Shall I explain to her Mr. Kemper's desertion, or save you by a jestY?-declaring that he was never to have been the bridegroom, and laughing at the misunderstand- ing?"  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7897-00000054"/> 106      LEFT TO HERSELF. "I cannot be more miserable. Save your pride, if you will. I have no more." Mrs. White communicated to her nephew the result of their machinations, and instantly, with native malice, he declared that he would invite Mr. Kemper to be one of his groomsmen. In vain were Mrs. White's remonstrances; write he would, and did. Mr. Kemper would, of course, not ac- cept the invitation, and he delighted in the anticipation of that gentleman's impotent wrath. Mrs. White would not allow her nephew now to annoy Kate by his presence, and possibly induce revolt, but permitted her daughter to remain almost constantly in her chamber as the day for her marriage drew near. Nicholas White, in the mean time, received from Mr. Kemper an acceptance of his invitation. CHAPTER XI. ON the piazza of the United States Hotel at Saratoga, sat a gentleman, evidently German, listening with eager attention to the sound of voice and piano that came from a private parlor near. Quite a crowd of other listeners had gathered round, and now paid the rare tribute of silence to the wonderful voice which came floating toward them through the twilight; came round, and smooth, and pure, like a shower of pearls through the summer gloaming. Truly, the performance was worthy this unusual mani- festation of admiration; but for the Count Von Laben- stein it possessed a charm apart from its own excellence.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        107 In vain did the ladies, as they approached in their be- witching toilets, cast glances at the titled German, who, with his dancing and music, had created= such a furore among thems The singer's voice had taken him back to Europe. His thoughts had gone back eighteen months, and were with a girl who had the voice of Israfel,-the seraph harper Israfel, whose heartstrings are a lute, and who has the sweetest voice of all God's creatures. The hours spent together had been to him as sweet as her voice, and briefer than her song; but their somewhat stormy parting had been a rough dash across his heartstrings, whose discordant vibrations had not yet ceased. With the sound of this voice, therefore, came the recollection of much anger and pain as well as happiness. The deliciously dreamy prelude chords of Schubert's serenade were followed by the song itself,-one of the sweetest in the world. "No one else can sing that song," said the Count to himself. 4 It must be, it is Edith Shelley." Thereupon he sent up his card, and his whilom friend received him at the parlor door. Excitable, irritable, and exacting, this lover of a year ago would not have been welcome to Edith except for the prestige which seemed just now to attach to his name; but it being her will and habit to monopolize the lion of any assembly of which she might form a part, she ac- corded him friendly greeting. A short time after, as they stood by the piano looking over some music, he asked, suddenly, "Do you remember the last evening you spent in Paris?" "Oh, yes," she answered. "What spirit moved you that evening? I have never been able to solve the enigma of your conduct."  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7897-00000055"/> 108      LEFT TO HERSELF. "I scarcely know. I suppose I was tired of love- making. My tastes do not incline to the sentimental." "Have you since become tolerant of it?" "No.!" "I had hoped  " "That subject, Count, was discussed finally on the evening to which you have referred. Unless you have determined, as I asked you, to give me back those silly letters, I shall be glad if you never again mention the affair. " "In other words, you love another. Is it not so?" "No, I do not love another; but neither do I love you." "Once you declared otherwise," he said. u Change was made for all on earth, Was it not made for me?" sang Edith, lightly, touching the keys of the piano. "Ah 1 here comes Charlie with letters; or, as he accuses me of saying, here come the letters with Charlie. Count, I believe I need not introduce my brother." "I have not forgotten that I once had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Shelley quite well." "Thank you," said Charles; "I remember my short visit with great pleasure. Here are two letters, Edith; one from Ned, and one from Muncair." As the Count took leave, she said he must devote some of his time to singing with her. He was very sincere in speaking of the happiness it would afford him, and if you were then at Saratoga, you have not forgotten the enthu- siasm of the visitors in regard to our amateur musicians. The Count soliloquizes: "Does the man live who could prefer another woman to her? And Hlike a fool!-   LEFT TO HERSELF.        109 heigho i"And he scraped a match across the sole of his boot. "What does Ned say?" asked Charles. Edith handed him Mr. Bertnord's letter, and continued her perusal of that from Mr. Muncair,--the unfortunate epistle which the trusty Joe had left to the guardianship of the curbstone. We will glance over Cbharles's shoulder as he reads the concluding paragraph of Mr. Bertnord's letter,-a para- graph which had not tended to secure Edith's peace of mind. "By the way, I thought you said Frank Muncair was at the White Sulphur Springs. I saw a gentleman this morning-one of the hunt-who says M. has been in Lorburg all summer, courting your cousin, Miss Lock- hart. What do you say to that?  I understand, how- ever, from the same source, that he has left, 'propelled by the gentle momentum of a female slipper.' Direct to New Orleans. I shall be there before you write. Give my love to Charlie, and make him bring you home." CHAPTER    XII. WITHOUT acknowledging to herself that she expected Frank's return, or even a letter from him, Florence was still startled by every vigorous ring at the door-bell and every letter just from the office. "Perhaps"--it alwavs ended there. Were he to return, would she act differ- ently? Were lie to write, what reason to suppose him more true to her than to Edith Shelley, to whom he like- 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7897-00000056"/> "O      L EFT TO HERSELPF. wise wrote? None, absolutely none. And yet, perhaps she had been hasty, harsh, giving him no opportunity to defend himself. But no, she would not deceive herself. Reason brought no verdict against her. She had been to him in every particular candid, open, frank. In at least one most essential point he had been wanting toward her. No, she had been neither harsh nor unjust. Meantime it was with much regret that John noted the change in his cousin. She was neither unkind nor un- charitable; but this was the result of habit, and not of any present desire to do well, or the active exertion of principle. It was simply an absence of actual wrong- doing, and this, the most to be expected of some, was the least he had ever looked for in her. What had passed between Frank and herself he could not know with certainty; but observation led him very near the truth, and a knowledge of his own heart unveiled to him much that was passing in hers. Anxious to remind her that she was not alone in suf- fering, nor so afflicted as many, many others, he accused her of having lately neglected his parishioners, and asked her to make some visits with him. The scenes are not new: a drunken, selfish, idle hus- band; an overworked, ill-treated wife; ignorant, dirty, half-starved children. Farther on, a woman had been the demon of her household, profane, quarrelsome, idle, and untidy. They found her by the corpse of her little child, the one sweet flower of her worthless life. Truly her punishment was great, and she knew not how to bear it. With the dumb sorrow of a brute she sat by her baby and mourned without hope, sinful, sorrowing, despairing. "Come, Florence, back to your refined, happy home, and the loving hearts that are waiting for you. You are not compelled even to witness suffering such as this."   LEFT TO HERSELF. -\1\ "God forgive me," she answered with a sob; but John walked silently on with eyes upon the ground. On her knees she opened the little Bible, her friend and comforter, and her eyes fell upon the words, "Have faith in God.' With passionate energy she pressed her lips to the verse and prayed for faith, strength, loving trust. And before she left her chamber, there shone upon her features the holy light which cometh only of that peace which passeth all understanding. The precarious condition of her mother's health with- drew the mind of Florence still more from herself; and as she continued to assist John in the performance of his charitable duties, her sorrow was not, for want of con- trast, made to assume undue proportions. It was about the first of October the weather became suddenly very cold, and a penetrating easterly rain- set in. Reluctantly the windows were closed, and fires crackled on the chamber-hearths, while Pedro curled himself upon a mat in the hall, and the canaries ruffled their plumes defiantly. Straw matting was yet on the floor, and flowers filled the vases; but heavier curtains had been hung, and thus a dreary prospect excluded-streaming panes, dim mountain outlines, bare fields, skeleton fences, dahas hanging their heavy heads, petal by petal strew- ing the ground; only the cool-breathed chrysanthemum bravely blossoming. Florence and John were playing chess, when Mr. Lockhart entered. "John, you leave for New Orleans when?" "Within a fortnight." "Can you go sooner?" "Yes, sir." "How much?" "On Monday, sir, if you wish it."  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7897-00000057"/> "I want you to rent apartments, or a house there. My wife cannot stand this weather, and has made herself sick crying about being parted from her boy, as she calls you. So under the circumstances we had better all go to- ,gether." "But going to Florida, sir, was of great service to her last winter." "But she hates the thought of Florida, so Florida is not the place for her, and there's an end of it. You go on Monday?" Of course, sir; I shall be only too glad to go on such an errand." "Very well." Exit Mr. Lockhart, senior. John was about to ask Florence how she liked the change of plan, but glancing at her face he only said, "Lady, your knight is captured and your castle in danger."  Playing at random, she was soon checkmated, and he went to sleep on the sofa. Her predominant feeling was one of fear lest Frank Muncair should think she had repented his hasty dis- -missal, and induced this change with the hope of seeing him again; and so distasteful was this thought, that only the desire to gratify her mother could have led her silently to risk being so grievously misunderstood. Then there was the unacknowledged wish to see him again; the -pleasurable thought of seeing her cousin Charles; and that, not so agreeable, of meeting her cousin and rival, Edith Shelley. But faith, health, and youth make one very hopeful. As the blazing coal threw its lights and shadows over the room, Florence sat gazing absently into the fire. Of what was she dreaming? Can you not remember the time when you, too, sat looking into the fire; or, were it summer,   LEFT TO HERSELF.        113 gazing dreamily at the gorgeous beauty of the sunset clouds, with Hope and Fancy, loved deceivers, unrolling to your view the panorama of a future which could never be realized? As you sat with your hand pressed over your eyes, "thinking," did not the imprisoned light gleam with a magic brightness over the flowery fields through which you wished to rove? Where are they? You are in the common highway; you stumble, you fall, and are trampled upon. You will rise and in your turn trample on others who have fallen.

On Monday, as proposed, John left Lorburg. During the followings week his uncle received from him a letter explaining the arrangements made, and urging him to bring his wife South as soon as possible. He had dined with Charles -Shelley, who, with his sister, had just re- turned from the North. He had also spent an evening at Mr. Shellev's, and had there met with Frank Muncair. Mr. Lockhart decided on removing immediately to New Orleans, traveling by short stages, that his wife might not be unnecessarily fatigued. CHAPTER    XIII. AT the time appointed for Kate's marriage, Mr. Kem- per's name was on the list of arrivals at one of the Vicksburg hotels. Contempt and anger had almost subdued his love; he felt that he could act with indifference,-at any rate, with calmness; and he determined not to give Mrs. White the pleasure of seeing how much her triumph cost him. On the morning of the twentieth Mr. Kemper called upon the candidate for matrimony and expressed his willingness to make any necessary arrangements; but Mr. White required nothing more of him than to draw off the bride's glove and conduct her to supper. Only that.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        115 At the same hour Mrs. White wag telling Kate that Mr. Kemper had desired to act as first groomsman, and that Nicholas had consented, being under the impression that Kate had been the jilt instead of the jilted. She ex- pressed in strong terms her indignation at this additional insult, and exhorted Kate to firmness. Mr. Kemper was very pale, but, with unfaltering calmness, drew the glove from that hand whose touch he had known so well, and after the ceremony quietly tendered his congratulations. What a mockery it seemed, as with eyes upon the ground and leaning perforce upon her bridegroom's arm she listened I  "Miss Kate-Mrs. White, rather," said Charles Shel- ley, who, with Frank, had gone to Vicksburg to attend the wedding, "I suppose our walks are now to be num- bered among the things that were? Unfortunate wretch that I am, where shall I find your substitute? Why, the tiny bells of the wild flowers will refuse to nod to me, the dogs we used to meet will turn the corner when they see nle coming, the very flagstones will rise up against me and demand again the adorable little gaiter that used to accompany my boot." "Shall they never more behold thee, Katy darling?" chimed in Edward Bertnord. ," Mrs. White!"How pale she turned as the name seemed to link her indissolubly with him from whom she received it I Several gentlemen were standing togetiher taking wine, among them Nicholas White, who suddenly turned to Mr. Kemper, and, slapping him familiarly on the shoulder, ex- claimed, "Well, Kemper, old fellow, how do you feel now?" Mr. Kemper's first impulse was to knock him down, or to dash the wineglass in his face; but he merely said, while a smile of undisguised contempt distorted his lip,-  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7897-00000059"/> "6      LEFT TO HERSELF. "I feel that "An eagle tow'ring in his pride of place Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed." Mr. White had no idea what was meant, and, acciden- tally adopting a sensible expedient, ventured no reply. Mr. Kemper turned, and, leaving the group, confronted Kate's mother. "Mr. Kemper l" she exclaimed. "I am happy to see you." "Thank you, madam." "I hope you are well?" "Perfectly so, madam."' "I feared we should not have the pleasure of your company to-night," she continued, taking a petty delight (now that Kate had pronounced her marriage vows) in the annoyance which she knew her remarks must occa- sion; but though his replies were brief, his manner was suave, and he was apparently in no haste to discontinue the conversation. "Your apprehensions were groundless, madam. I did not think of declining your invitation." "You received my letter?"Lowering her voice. "Did your daughter not deliver my reply, madam?" "I--oh, yes; but I wished merely to assure you again that I had no part in Kate's determination." "A second assurance is unnecessary, madam. I be- lieved you quite as implicitly in the first instance as at present." A lady observed to Mrs. White, "Well, I think it very strange and ungrateful of Mr. Kemper to be going to weddings, and his uncle not dead a week." "What uncle?"Mrs. White inquired. "Why, his mother's own brother; ,he did live some-   LEFT TO HERSELF.-       11? where out of the world; but I suppose Mr. Kemper knows he's got the money and doesn't care what people think. He left a large fortune, and Mr. Kemper inherits it all." Mrs. White felt nauseated-absolutely ill. In her heart she knew that her nephew was repulsive in spite of his money, and as she had not sold Kate simply to see her suffer, it was painful to know how useless had been the sacrifice. It was, of course, now too late to repair the wrong; but Mrs. White could not endure the idea of being disliked, or even coldly looked upon, by a rich man, so she again made her way to Mr. Kemper's side and playfully reproached him for not having in- formed her of his good fortune that she might congratu- late him. He turned and looked silently at her; she hastily added, "And to condole most deeply with you on the loss of your dear uncle." "Mrs. White," he at last said, bitterly, "there are many things that a man does not care to buy." CHAPTER    XIV. Is it not singular, the utter abandon with-which a proud, reserved woman loves, after she has once acknowledged the fact to herself? Edith loved Frank Muncair, and into this channel flowed her feelings, with all the strength and impetuosity of a nature untamed by a sense of any- thing superior to its own will.- Returned home, mortified, angry, and humbled, Edith's but half-disguised joy at seeing him, and her unceasing  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7897-00000060"/> 1,1          v T II V SCW1 Jy. efforts to please, were as balm of Gilead to Frank's wounded spirit, and the sun which rose on Florence's departure from Lorburg saw also Frank as Edith Shel- leyts accepted lover. Conscious that it could not make him happy to marry her, conscious, also, that he should fail to meet the demands of her exacting nature, he in- stantly regretted the false step, and loved her less than before; but it was now too latet(so he said to himself), and the future must take care of itself; the present was more than enough for him. Not many days later, a party on horseback, led by Frank and Edith, met a hack containing three persons, John Lockhart, Florence, and her mother. Frank's hand rested lightly on the pommel of Edith's saddle, and he was gazing into her beautiful face with the admiration of an artist, if not with the tenderness of a lover. So much Florence beheld as John bowed, and she glanced out of the window; but the equestrians passed too quickly for her to discover, while learning the lady!s name, how disconcerted became that lady's cavalier, and how he cut his horse, then roughly reined him in, as the obedient animal bounded forward. Edith made some gay remark about her clerical ad- mirer, which induced Frank to inquire how long she had known John Lockhart.  She replied that Charhe had frequently, within the last two weeks, brougrht Mr, Lock- hart to dine with him; and, as it was evident that he was intended for something better than dispensing small Testaments and patting ragged children on the head, she considered herself under a solemn obligation to convince him of the fact. Frank made some sarcastic comments on the vanity of woman, and ended with the taunting, but smiling, assurance that her attractions were too   LEFT TO HERSELF.        119 much of the earth, earthy, to ensnare a man of Lockhart's stamp; also, that if she could obtain such an indorser, he, Frank, would forever after yield her homage unques- tioning as devout. He talked on restlessly, and she, llore than half in earnest, declared that he should yet see this saint bow at her wicked feet. Impatient with her as he had been from the moment she accepted him, he protested against such heartless- ness, and ended with the indignant avowal that he had rather see his sister dead than know her a flirt. He had spoken without reflection, and was recalled to a sense of his present position only by the surprise and pique visible in her countenance. She, however, soon rallied, and said, with a slight laugh, "Do you mean to be personal, sir?" He quietly answered that she could not believe it, thinking of him as now  in duty bound, or simply as a gentleman. Her flirtations lie knew to have been numer- ous, but not to his knowledge objectionably desperate. "That is," he continued, " you have never engaged your- self to a man who really loved you, and presently sent him adrift with a quiet 'No, thank you.' Edith, I believe I should hardly love you if I thought it." She averred that her flirtations invariably ended with the declaration. All she required of a man was that he should define his position: he might then consider him- self '" off duty" as regarded herself. To Frank alone bad she ever been engaged.  Her heart sank as she thought of her ci-devant fiance, the Count, who, greatly to her annoyance, had followed them to New Orleans, and seemed little disposed to be tolerant of rivalry. Edith now endeavored to divert the course of conversation, and inquired the names of the ladies with Mr. Lock. hart. After a moment's involuntary hesitation he told  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7897-00000061"/> 120      LEFT TO HERSEiF. her. Edith was too thoroughly conversant with French dramas and romances and the unhealthy literature of her native land to be very simple-minded or unsuspicious. She recalled the closing paragraph in Mr. Bertnord's letter, turned pale from jealousy, and, with a sarcastic smile on her handsome mouth, asked if the lady's health had already become too delicate for the rigor of Virginia winters. "I know at present as little of your cousin as you do yourself," he answered, so coldly that she said no more. Edith stood before her full-length mirror, which re- fleeted the dark, heavy folds of a trailing skirt, drooping plunmes, snowy linen, dainty whip, a gauntlet at her feet; more than these,-a splendid figure, cheeks aglow, and eyes lit up by exercise. She thought of the pale and somewhat sad-looking girl, whose eyes she had encoun- tered, and perhaps the smile with which she turned away was not unjustifiable. But just then Frank Muncair, in his own room, was reflecting on beauty of a different nature. !"Miss Edith," said Labenstein, during the evening, "I feel great curiosity regarding that ring which you have worn for a day or two past." "Ah? Why? It is not remarkable." "But you have hitherto objected to rings; as, I pre- sume, you would object to gildinrg refined gold. Will you consider me impertinent if I ask where you obtained it?" "Decidedly so."        J 'And you will not tell-me?" "Oh, yes. It came from a jeweler's, I believe." "Abhem I As most of Miss Shelley's wit is genuine, a few counterfeits may pass," said Labenstein, pushinmg a book impatiently aside. After a silence of some moments   LEFT  '0O HERSELF.     : 121 he asked, abruptly, "Did Mr. Muncair or Mr. Bertnord give you that ring?" "Why do you ask?" "From a very natural reason. Because I wish to know." "But suppose I do not choose that you shall?" "But I will." "Ah?" "Yes." "How will you ascertain?" "I will ask them." "You will not." "Why will I not?" She looked at him and softly answered, "Because I do not wish it, and you will do nothing to wound me." He smiled, and said, "I might affect to do it from mo- tives of friiendship. One of the injured should make of himself a warning to his brethren. Do you not think so?" "And injure the woman he pretends to love?" No! she protested that she could see no manliness, no generosity in that. She would not deny that he could injure her, having in his possession her picture and those ridiculous letters. He might exhibit these, but neither honor nor the love he professed for her could excuse an act so base. He asked in whose estimation it would injure her so greatly,-in that of Mr. Muncair, possibly, or of Mr. Bertnord,--both favorites apparently. She said they were undoubtedly favorites, but not lovers; hence the greater frankness of her manner toward them. '   ( "Yes, you may injure me in their estimation ; but how ' would youw then, stand in mine? You know I make few honest, true friends. Like Kirke White, "  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7897-00000062"/> 122       LEFT TO HERSELF. ' I show no respect when I never can feel it, , And as for contempt take no pains to conceal it; And so in the suite, by these laudable ends, I've a great many foes and a very few friends.' But those I have are prized beyond measure. Not lovers, be pleased to understand." She talked with him until he was almost persuaded to believe her, and, for the time at least, was silenced. But the following day, after taking m'ore wine at dinner than was quite necessary to prepare hinm for the evening's campaign, -though not sufficient to intoxicate him, he entered Mr. Shelley's parlor, where, to his great dis- pleasure, he found Edith and Frank in evidently amicable tete-d-tete. "Ah, Count,!' said Edith, "you are but just too late to hear a discussion on the merits and demerits of your Vaterland. " "Perhaps it is better so," was the ungracious reply. "With the facility of a woman you may have changed your opinion of my Vaterland, and with the vanity of a woman, loth to hide her wit yet wanting another target, may have aimed at what was once loved." "Certainly," said Edith, haughtily, "I should find there no dearth of subjects for wit and humor; but Hood has aiticipated me. I shall not presume to whisper where he has spoken. Your patriotism, Count, is com- mendable. Did you appreciate my want of another target that you introduced yourself just at this moment?" "In her appreciation of Hood, Miss Shelley seems to have forgotten another English poet, who is perhaps not entirely beneath notice. Pope says: 'Some, to whom Heaven in wit has been profuse, Want as much more, to turn it to its use.'   L EFT TO HERSELF.       123 "But may I ask what gave. rise to the discussion?" "We were speaking," said Frank, "of German literature. in the first instance, and that naturally led to Germany and the Germans. I should have better sustained my part in the conversation, however, had I given to the literature of your country the industry you have bestowed on ours. Miss Edith has been telling me how indefati- gably you devoted yourself to the study of English." Labenstein looked at him a moment, as though willino to enter into a war of wits with him also; but Frank gave- him nothing to quarrel about in the presence of a lady, so turaning again to Edith, the Count remarked, that as she had spent some time in Germany, and it was his native land, perhaps their united experience might interest Mr. Mun- cair; if she had forgotten he could refresh her memory, Sorely against her inclination, Edith was compelled to choose the better part of valor, and in doing so yield the sweet privilege of the gentler sex,-that of having the last word. She checked the contemptuous retort which had already parted her lips, and asked him to refresh her memory with some of the songs he used to sing. "Excuse me, I never sing those songs now. Mr. Mun- cair, we have both read Hyperion; do you remember the song of the wandering musician? I will try it for you; though," he added, opening the piano and seating him- self, "if Miss Shelley has educated you as thoroughly in certain branches as- she has myself, you will call this an old song." He sang: "I know a maiden fair to see, Take care! She can both false and friendly be, Beware! Beware! Trust her not, she is fooling thee," etc.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7897-00000063"/> 124        LEFT TO HERSELF. "How do you like it, sir?"  Turning from the instru- ment. "Very much," Frank quietly answered. "The music is striking," said Edith, looking naively at him.  "I never heard you sing it before." "No, I had not learned it when I first knew you.   I wish I had.  Mr. Muncair, you admire that; here is another quite as good: , Oh, let not a planet-like eye Imbeam its tale on thine; In truth 'tis a lie-though a lie Scarce less than truth divine. And the light of its look on the young Is wildfire in the soul; Ye follow and follow it long, But find nor good nor goal. Then pass by beauty with looks above, Oh, seek never-share never-woman's love. 'Oh, let not a 'wildering tongue Weave bright webs over thine ear; Nor thy spirit be said nor sung To the air of smile or tear. And say it hath melody far More than the spheres of Heaven; Though to man and the morning star They sang-Ye be forgiven! Yet pass by beauty with looks above, Oh, seek never-share never-woman's love.'" Thinking the Count rather intoxicated and very im- pertinent, Frank made no comment on his performance, but asked Edith what she thought of Miss Brown's tableaux. Labenstein looked at them with a sullen glare in his blue eyes, and abruptly left the room as Edward Bertnord and Charlie entered. She was saying how dull she had thought the afore- said tableaux, when Charlie asked where she supposed   LEFT TO HERSELF.        125 he had been. On her professing her inability to form the most remote idea, he condescended to enlighten her, and said he had been to see the Lockharts, adding that he could never forget how kind they had been to him years before, and he lhoped Edith would visit them, thus proving herself not ungrateful for affection shown her brother. Frank leaned forward and played with the dog which had come in with Charlie. Edith subdued for the present her surprise and dis- pleasure, and, with the elegant falsity of a fine lady, de- clared her desire to make her brother's friends her own. Edward bluntly inquired if there were not some diffi- culty between the two branches of their family; and as Charles entered into the history of that idle quarrel, Frank asked Edith to play. Charles and Edward became silent. At length the latter meditatively remarked, "Music is a strange thing --a strange thing. ' Say, how canst thou mourn? How canst thou rejoice? Art but metal dull! And yet all our rejoicings, And all our sorrowings, Thou dost feel them all!' Child, you little know how much true, pure pleasure that instrument has given me. Who can tell what music gives him? Wealth-fanme-they are no prices by which to estimate it. Pay down love, and even then the debt is all the same. When I thought I could write poetry, and I have thought so occasionally, some good verses have come to me as a requital for your music. My only regret at their not appearing in print, or even in manu- script, is this :--you know 1 like you, but you do not "*  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7897-00000064"/> 126      LEFT TO -HERSELF. know how much you have done for me. Remember this great power God has given you.  Never neglect it; for by it you may save a soul; at least you can on this earth carry it to heaven. 'Tis an infinitely precious gift you have, and should be cultivated religiously. To me there is no such power on earth. Mortal life is worth- less compared to certain chords which seem to envelop and bear it beyond life. Consider the immateriality of tuneful sound: mere air, vibrating more or less rapidly, and striking the drum of the ear. What is it, and how is it that these pulsings of that which we can never see have such mastery over the soul?-making it recognize itself and interpreting immortality. Why it should touch a man-move his inmost soul--to hear the jingle of a few wires I am at a loss to imagine. And then this strange feeling of remembrance which thrills you for a moment and is gone. Yes, there can be no doubt of it, in some state of prior existence I was-must have been --an organ-grinder." Edith reminded him of a nursery superstition by which they might account for this feeling, it being asserted that during the first month of a man's life the whole of his future passes in review before him. "No doubt," said Edward, " his good and evil angels (we have two apiece, I am told) fight ferociously for the upper hand during the panorama. By the way, wlhy cannot we make that the foundation of a little acting? If only there were such a thing as a good, sensible baby. " Edith said she knew of a baby, certainly the best and quietest living, but- she imagined not very sensible; in fact, it was too good to be anything but what the Irish call an Innocent. "'Tis only noble to be good,'" he quoted, in reply; "especially where babies are concerned. Edith would   LEFT TO HERSELF.        127 be the evil genius, of course; too brilliant not to be wicked; and who would be guardian angel?" "Florence Lockhart," suggested Charles. Edith was silent. Edward acquiesced. Edith then objected that Florence was too much of a devotee to participate in amusements so essentially worldly. Charles defended his cousin warmly, protesting that her religion was too pure and undefiled to render her gloomy or disinclined to innocent enjoyment. "Perhaps so," Edith said coldly. "Of course her presence would be a source of great pleasure; but I imagine that she would be cruel enough to withhold the favor on such an occasion. From the glimpse I had of her face I thought her staid, prim, and desperately pious." Frank abruptly said good-night, and left, to drink calm ness, if not repose, from "The cool cisterns Of the midnight air," -subsequently, something more substantial from a dif- ferent fount. While Charles and Edward continued the conversation, Edith fell into a reverie. At present she felt no jealousy, simply because nothing sufficiently definite had occurred to arouse the feeling; but the monster lay full grown within her heart, wanting only a word to illume his green eyes and send him forth upon his mission of evil. If jealousy be the offspring of conscious inferiority, we have misused the term in applying it to Edith Shelley; for notwithstanding her concealment of every feeling akin to vanity, she duly appreciated her own advantages,  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7897-00000065"/> 128       LEFT TO IIERSELF. and had full confidence in those powers of fascination which hitherto had never failed her, and which she knew to be the result of a; copartnership such as is rarely formed between Art and Nature. Nevertheless a feelingo of dissatisfaction had been generated by Mr. Bertnord's repetition of the rumor that Frank had not. confined him- self to the mansion of his hospitable relatives while in Lorburg; and a feeling of intense dislike to Florence had taken possession of her soul, increased by the convic- tion that it was for the dear sake of Frank Muncair that her cousin had made this change of route, and chosen New Orleans in preference to Florida. But so far she did not fear her, she only resented the supposed fact of another seeking what she looked upon as her own, and regarded Florence as a bold and scheming girl, spurning altogether the report that she had discarded Mr. Muncair. "What! a girl from the backwoods, a girl from a village in the mountains, a girl who during her unsophisticated existence had probably never seen a polished gentleman, much less an acknowledged leader of ton,--such a one discard Frank Muncair!"A smile of contemptuous incredulity rested on her lip. Unless, indeed, Florence were incapable of appreciating refinement and superiority great as his; but Charlie's admiration negatived that idea, and Edith was strengthened in the conviction that Ler cousin was more loving than loved, more persevering than proud. Next was debated within herself the expediency of forming this cousin's acquaintance; whether to introduce her gracefully and make her time pass pleasantly, or to defy Charles, and, on the plea of respect for her father, refuse all companionship with his half-brother's child. But she could not forget that Charles too had his share of the Shelley blood as well as lady friends who would   L,'EI' vTO HERSELF.      129 secure to Florence the entree into any society she might prefer; and, as Edith really loved her brother, his simple wish was not without its influence. She decided to call the next day. At any rate, by forming the acquaintance of her tender-hearted relative from the mountains, she should, no doubt, secure entertainment in witnessing manceuvres less skillful than determined, more vigorous than effective. So-"To-morrow, Charlie. " As Florence lay down to sleep that night there was, in her sick heart, little thought of manceuvre. The face that pressed her pillow was quiet though sad, and hardly were the draperies of her bed more colorless, but written on it was no evidence of any present struggle. An hour ago, and she' had begged passionately of God that Frank might love her; but then she bowed her head ashamed. Might not his love be as dear to Edith Shelley as to herself? Might he not be all to Edith that he had ever been to her? Might not Edith, too, his love withdrawn, suffer and be sick at heart? Dared she ask God to throw her cares upon a fellow-being,--one who would spurn his aid in bearing them?   No. Rather pray for Edith, pray that his love, if it were indeed hers, might ennoble and purify her, that it might exalt her being and become to her a stepping-stone of salvation. But again-no!   And here human nature steadily re- sisted. She could not sincerely pray thus, for she could not wish any woman happy in Frank's affection.  She could only clasp her hands and pray that God would forgive her, would comfort her, and not despise her utterly; and that He would enable her to feel rightly and to act less unworthily.  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7897-00000066"/> 130.      LEFT TO HERSELF. CHAP TER XV. WHEN Charles and Edith were announced next morn- ing, Florence felt a pang of surprise, apprehension, dis- like ; she scarcely knew what. But no time was afforded for the analysis of feeling while introductions were taking place,"and in much the ordinary manner were the ordinary civilities interchanged; no feeling that might hdve ruffled those calm brows and placid lips making itself visible in the faces of the two ladies who smiled so sweetly on each other, for you may have observed that- "The higher high life is this side an attic, The more it shrinks from aught that looks dramatic." Oh, no; this was not hypocrisy. It was in Edith a polished ease and adaptation of manner to surrounding circumstances, which intercourse with society had longr since given her, while with Florence it was the result of native politeness, and a desire to please Charlie by doing full justice to his sister. And Charles was delighted. Like most good men he was terribly stupid about women, and not knowing the true value of such little manifestations, sat quietly looking on, rather surprised, but very much gratified, while, truth to tell, the girls were keenly observing and rapidly learn- ing to dislike each other. This, under different circumstances, they might not have done; but now both felt wronged, and each felt that the other had been the cause of her particular wrong. The difference between them lay in the fact that Edith sought   LEFT TO HERSELF.        131 and magnified her cousin's defects, thus excusing to her- self a dislike for which said defects were in nod-degree re- sponsible, while Florence endeavored to beat down Satan under her feet, kept better guard over her heart and re- proached herself for the desire she felt never to see Edith again, and for the knowledge that she should dislike her, while conscientiously seekidg for virtues and trying to rejoice at finding them,-a difficult task, and one in which she was not likely to succeed, yet at least her spirit was ennobled and strengthened by the effort. Edith at length mentioned the entertainment which had been proposed by Edward on the previous evening, and requested Florence to accept the part suggested for her; but the invitation was extended in such a tone that Flor- ence was about to decline when Chbles impplored her not to do so, protesting that such an excess of piety was more than the Thirty-nine Articles demanded. She assured him that she did not regard it as a matter wherein the Thirty- nine Articles were at all concerned; her unfitness for the task being a sufficient impediment. Charles became now so urgent in his entreaties that Edith was forced to renew hers also, though coldly; for she already perceived that Florence was more nearly her peer than she had imagined, and slowly, but surely, the serpent was warming into life. At length, and sorely against the bent of pride and inclination, Florence yielded; fearing, in the first place, that she had been unjustly suspicious of Edith, whose un- pleasantness of manner had possibly existed in imagina- tion only; and in the second, disliking even the seeming to repel any of the advances made by her cousins. So she finally acquiesced, only saying,- "You must undertake my tuition, Charlie, before I make my'debut, for you know I am just from the oak-clad hills."  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7897-00000067"/> 132       LEFT TO HERSELF. "Where your father's hut doth stand," he chanted in reply. "Oh, I promise careful instruction, and predict your triumph." "A novice,' said Edith (the Parthian arrow as she rose to leave), "one 'Unused to all the arts and wiles That worldlings prize.' The gentlemen- regard this as a very pretty role ; I advise you to adopt it." It was said so playfully, and the good-by kiss was given so prettily, that Florence hardly knew whether the remark had been intentionally sarcastic; but feeling in- stinctively that it was, she answered with a heightened color and a forced sAle, "Thank you, I have no designs upon the Messrs. Smith of your drawing-room that would repay me for the trouble of appearing in any character not my own." "Oh, shocking I shocking 1"Edith gleefully exclaimed. "Do'take me home, Charlie I Good-by, sweet cousin; I shall not touch that velvet glove again. -Ah, no; that laugh comes too late. You have betrayed yourself." Adding in a pretended whisper to her brother, as she held her handkerchief to her face, "How her saintship smells of brimstone!" They all laughed,-Charles, poor fellow, louder than anybody, he was so glad to see them like each other. Just as they left, John presented himself, whereupon Edith peremptorily ordered him to take his seat in the carriage, as she wanted him to dine with her; and will- ingly enough -he availed himself of the invitation, for in her society the hours went by more velvet-footed than conscience liked to see. It is a dangerous thing, John Lockhart, for you to sit   LEFT TO HERSELF.        133 looking into her soft eyes and listening to her sweet voice calling you " cousin." "Beware! Beware I Trust her not I She's fooling thee."  And meantime duty beckons to a different scene; but you turn away your eyes and will not go. Beware I Beware! He liked elegance; he could appreciate refinement. It was pleasant to him to be surrounded by pictures and books and works of art from the Old World ; in such an atmosphere he "felt at home and at ease. It was more pleasant still to sit by this girl who in a few brief weeks had won his heart. Her melting tones stole away his firmness, and threat- ened that self-respect which had hitherto stood so fair on the sandy foundation of good resolutions; yet he found it hard to leave her for the sick-roojtof a pauper. At lengcth Frank Muncair's voice was heard in the hall; Charlie's also; the latter saying, as he passed through the front door, "We shall meet again presently; I am going to take my cousin, Miss Lockhart, to the opera, and I believe you are going there with Edith; are you not?" - "Yes," said Frank, and entered the parlor. John stood looking after the carriage that bore Frank and Edith toward the scene of pleasure; then slowly bent his steps in the direction of the beggar's home, where he should have gone hours before. It was a great trial to him. Goaded by conscience, he was compelled to yield the society of a gay, bright party, and the woman. he loved, for- that of suffering and un- happy wretches; not that alone-degraded, selfish, com- plaining. It was very bitter. He felt it so. "Cramped, bound down, fettered, coffined, chainedl An obscure preacher, when I might have won a name!

Alas, unwilling servant, forgetful of His words: "That which I do, ye know not now, but shall know hereafter." He entered the hovels of the poor and sternly per- formed what he conceived to be his duty. Here was no romance. Poverty wore not here a " neatly fitting slip- per and plain but becoming wrapper." No, reader, no  Vulgar poverty is filthy, ragged, loathsome. He detested it. He abhorred it. His feeling was not sympathy, but utter disgust. Yet what was his mission? It was that which many a refine, cultivated, sensitive disciple fulfills willingly, though laboriously; uncomplainingly, though through much suffering; doing, after all, only what you and I expect of him. Little know you and I of the fiery temptation, the bitter sorrow, the stern struggle of the man. In listening to peevish complaints; to long and detailed accounts of sleepless nights and wearisome days; to tales of pain and sorrow; petty and great misfortunes; he felt a burning impatience that sometimes amounted to agony. It so tortured him that it was only by the ut- most effort of will. that he for a moment retained his seat. "Oh," he exclaimed, "' I have a heart to dare, And spirit thews to work my daring out, To cleave the world as a swimmer cleaves the sea! but not here. not here I It is bondage I It is slavery I It is-death I I long, I burn, I pine to be free Hto re- move- these manacles!-to ungyve my soul 1" Truly, the man's heart was sore within him. '"  ^  .   LEFT TO HERSELF.        135 This evening, Edith had playfully painted for him a brilliant future, and told him what manner of man her cousin must become, for what position he was best fitted. As he crossed the pauper's threshold he proudly asked of himself, "Is it for this?" and with shut teeth an- swered, "No!" But she had not conquered in an hour; and the pure thoughts, the holy words, that were forced upon him at the bed of death, after awhile calmed his excited soul, and quieted the tumultuous throbbings of his wayward heart. No, she had not conquered in an hour, though traitors had already been at work within his heart's citadel; and as he rose from his knees and left the bed- side of the dying man, he asked himself in the quiet starlioight, "Is it for this?" and humbly murmured "No." There is nothing special to be said about the meeting of our friends at the opera. They spoke to each other quite as you and I would under apparently similar cir- cumstances. Mr. Muncair addressed one or two remarks to Miss Lockhart, and she was courteous enough to reply; but if either party made an observation calculated to secure immortality, we are not cognizant of the fact. The thoughts and feelings of the parties should not be so summarily disposed of; but as we eminent writers in- variably conclude, when the descriptive tide is receding, "thev can be better imagined than described." If this com- plinlentary disposition of the subject be not satisfactory to the reader, he will be consoled when informed that: his feelings are in perfect consonance with those of the per- sons referred to above,-dissatisfaction being with them also a. prominent feature. And should he fail to under- stand their feelings, it must be gratifying to him to know that they hardly understood them themselves. When Charhe had taken leave of Florence at her own  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7897-00000069"/> door, she went into the sitting-room, where6 she found John stretched wearily-on the lounge. Struck by his haggard appearance, she inquired if he were sick, and receiving for reply. only a shake of the head, refiained ,from further questioning. Unobserved by herself, John looked long at her as she stood near; and something in her face must have touched him, for he extended his hand and told her that he did not mean to be abrupt or unkind, -she must not think so. Her lips quivered, but she tried to smile. She knelt on the floor by his side, and, while assuring him that he had not wounded her feelings in the least, played caressingly with his hair. But it would not answer; and as John, putting his hand under her chin, raised her face and looked into it,-asking, "What is the matter, then I?"-her tears began to fall, and she an- swered that she did not know,-she believed she was tired. John knew; and as her head sank on his breast, he was silent, merely adopting her own movement,-stroking her hair gently and slowly. At length he sighed so heavily that she started up, and begged him to forgive her selfishness. But he interrupted her: "You are excited and tired, Florence; but if there be any real trouble beneath it all, perhaps you will like com- panionship in your sorrow. Are you too tired to hear how faithfully I can bear you company? It is about Edith Shelley. Do you believe her Engaged to Muncair?" Her face burned as she answered that she did not know. He asked what she thought about it, and received the same reply. "Well," said he, "I know that she is not. Shtold me so herself; and I know her to be too higrh-toned to avail herself of the privilege .usually claimed. She has assured me that she is not engaged to him." ,   LEFT TO HERSELF.        13. Florence sprang to her feet. pale and defiant. "John, have you humbled me to  " He bade her sit down; and without any apparent notice of the confession into which she had been betrayed, entered upon his own. At first his only thought had been to interest her, and, for her own sake, to induce Florence to confide in him; but as he dwelt upon Edith and his love for her, his heart grew warm and his words eloquent; and he talked on, forgetful of the motive that had first impelled him to speak. Then recurred in all their violence the feelings which had assailed him- but a few hours before. And as he paced the library to and fro with rapid and uncertain steps, she stood startled and amazed at the vehement torrent of pain, and passion, and bitterness, and regret that poured from his lips. In the madness of the moment he took a fierce delight in witnessing the sorrow that he saw his words inflicted; and the shock which he saw she felt, when he first spoke of his sacred office as a bar- rier and a cross, only incited him to wilder words, only induced him to repeat with tenfold violence all that he had said. He had tried so long and so hard to control all evidence of these feelings, and much of the time he had so faithfully given battle to the feelings themselves, that now, in yielding at all, he yielded utterly, and fiercely reveled in the delight of freedom even to sin. He talked on careless of, nay, almost savagely exulting in, the pain he gave and the wrong he did; talked on, repeating over and over again whatever was most likely to provoke retort and afford a plea for further excess. "f Florence was silent. Though he stood before her with clinched teeth and bloodshot eyes, and uttered words shocking to her soul, she spoke no word of reproof, gave no look of rebuke. She knew that this was not the 12*  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7897-00000070"/> 138      LEFT TO HERSELF. moment in which her voice should be heard, even had she not felt too sad to reproach. Suddenly he stopped. "i Have you never felt as I feel? Have you never suffered?--never sinned?--that you stand like a statue and -see me writhe before you, and give me no word, one way or the other?" "I have, John; I have both suffered and sinned. I suffer now through you." "You suffer because I sin; but that is not what I want. I tell you I scorn it! I trample on it! I spurn it I I am not thinking of sin nor of heaven, to-night. I want human sympathy for my human suffering. I want you to suffer because I suffer,--not because I sin." "From the bottom of my soul, I do. My heart aches for you, John, as though you had never sinned." He said to himself, "And as though it had nothing else to ache for.' I have forgotten all feeling but my own, and my thought was to turn comforter. Selfish I selfish I selfish! Like all the rest of the world, utterly selfish! Come here, Florence,-sit down. What was the matter with you when you came in to-night?" The last half-hour, with its voluntary and complete baring of his heart before her, had banished much reserve; but she did not immediately reply to his question; and he resumed, with a sudden and steadfast look: "You were engaged to Frank Muncair. Do you love him still?" The blood shot up into her face like an aurora in the heavens, and, with head erect, she answered, "No l" Keeping his eyes on hers, he said, "That is not true, though possibly you think so. What distressed you to- night? Why did you weep after seeing him with Edith Shelley? Do not be angry. Do not look proud and re-   LEFT TO HERSELF.        139 sentful,-I do not mean to be unkind; only-I want no reserve. I must have no half confidence.'- It was on her lips to tell him that his had been a vol- untary confession, and that she wished to make no confi- dant; but a gentler impulse prevailed, and to his imperi- ous command she replied, "I like Mr. Muncair. I shall always like him,-shall always admire him. I did love him, and was very happy in the belief of his love. The memory of those days at home was very vivid. It was very painful also. I was mortified. I was sorry I went to their box. I seemed to have thrown myself in his way. Our coming to New Orleans instead of going to Florida looked like it in- the first instance. That is all. I have no confidences to make." "Should you like me to marry Edith Shelley?" "No; there is much that is admirable about her, but her nature, perhaps originally noble, is perverted by the reading she prefers, the society she gathers around her, and   " "What injustice to a woman you hardly know I I had not supposed you capable of it." "I do know her," Florence replied, with ill-advised warmth.   "I do know her, and I know  of her. Her brother has often regretted to me the fact of her infidel proclivities; her insatiable love of French novels; her eagerness for everything dramatic, unusual; her love of flirtation; her passion for applause---" "A kind brother, truly." "Yes; for never was brother prouder or fonder of sister; and all this he attributes, no doubt justly, to de- fective education; but the fruits remain the same." "Goocl-night.,' But when he reached the head of the stairs he heard her footstep in the hall, and, looking back, saw that she  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7897-00000071"/> ".0      LEFT TO HERSELF. wanted to speak to him. She was calm again, and said, gently, "John, we are both in trouble; let us comfort each other. If you love her, I will not pain you by say- ing a word against her. Do not pain ile by withdrawing yourself from me now; for this is not home, and these are not friends." He had already repented his unkindness, and was glad she gave him an excuse to atone for it without sacrifice on his part. He replied briefly, but affectionately, and kissing her-good-night, they separated. After all, however, a woman has some slight advan- tage in cases of this kind, for surely when a man forgives benignly, never having been wronged, and woman accepts forgiveness joyfully, never having wronged, there must be a slight sense of dissatisfaction somewhere in his heart; some faint suspicion of injustice surely penetrates his soul and irritates his dignity just a little. But with her there is nothing to mar the fair proportions of the reconciliation; for, indeed, there is only one thing easier than accepting forgiveness from a man, and that one thing is forgiving him. Forgiving another woman,-well, that is a different thing. CHAPTER     XVI. KATE MANNING, or, as we must now call her, Kate White, was, by no means,. a woman of superior intellect, yet she had an instinctive love and perception of the right, which mere intellect often fails to confer. She was now married, and must forget her former love; nay, more, She must endeavor to love her husband; must search for the good qualities which he, in common with *'             , .ji   --,-,. 1 , a v , JaJuj.    I , all mankind, surely possessed, and not, even in ihought, dwell upon his faults. She would not look into the past; she could not " go forth to meet the shadowy future with- out fear," or with a hopeful heart, but she would endeavor "wisely to improve the present." Thus Kate thought and felt when first umarried. She had no longer strength or right to struggle against her destiny, and it was in her nature to avoid all contest, gleaning, as best she might, the few grains of happiness left her on the field of life, so rich in promise, so willfully made barren. But it was not for content that Mrs. White had planned, not for peace that she had plotted; and Kate was dragged to the theatre, decked for balls, and hurried to the dance, till even her gentle nature was at times embittered and aroused, and harsh wordst were on her lips, harsher thoughts within her heart, for both mother and husband. Nicholas had purchased the house in which Mrs. White had hitherto lived, and this, during their absence,:had been refitted and furnished with all the ostentation that folly could devise or wealth display; and now its trio of inmates had arrived, driving to the door of their palatial purgatory, while Edith and Charles-were making their first call on Florence Lockhart. Poor Kate I  As she sat leaning her head upon her. hand, she forgot that she had entered her dressing-room for the purpose of adorning herself for a party given in her honor. Her young heart could not calmly bear the strokes of unkind fortune, and in the midst of unwonted splendor she turned aside her head and wept. Mrs. White entered and forthwith began to scold. "Oh, mother, be good to me to-night I It is so hard to come hbmne as I do My  heart is aching with a wear- ing pain that will never cease. I try to keep back my  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7897-00000072"/> "2       LEFT TO HERSELF. tears, but they well up from my heart, and oh, I cannot I I cannot!-for I have no hope. Mother, I wish I were a Christian." "My dear child-of course-certainly-a-I am sure it is very right and proper for you to wish such a thing; but you take such odd times, Kate. You can see the minister at some time or other. I am sure I don't know what to do for you; you are no worse than other people. Do get up, Kate, and dress yourself. I am out of all patience with you, and Nicholas is waiting." '"Let himn wait." "It is all very well to say let him wait; but he is not more tolerant of waiting----" "It is a lesson he had time to learn before we were married; let him profit by it now." "Kate, get up and dress. What do you wear?' "I have not thoughlt about it." Mrs. White rang for Kate's maid. "Attend to your mistress's toilet immediately. Kate, I do not wish to be detained." At the expiration of an hour she returned magnificently attired. "Get your mistress a glass of wine. Kate, this will not do; you will make yourself the subject of remark. You look as pale and woe-begone as if---" "As if I had cause, I suppose." "Drink this. Have you rouge?" "No; I never before needed it. Happiness was my rouge, hope the artist."  "Do hush, Kate  I am perfectly sick of such stuff. Susan, bring that pink-saucer from my bureau. Here are you surrounded by the utmost splendor, dressed like a queen, the world at your command. Suppose you were Sam Kemper's wife--"   LEFT TO HERSELF.        143 "Ah!" said Kate, with an-uncontrollable cry of an- guish. "Do not tell me to suppose that I Do not tempt me to think of it I It is too much happiness!" "Kate Manning I I am your mother, and have borne from you what only a mother would; but if ever again such unprincipled and unwomanly words escape your lips, I shall think you too contemptible for me to acknowledge or associate-- " The maid re-entering, Mrs. White concluded her sen- tence by bidding Kate get up and hold her face to the light. Arrived at the scene of festivity, smiling faces greeted Kate, and old friends gathered around her--Charles and Edith Shelley, Edward Bertnord, Frank Muncair, the Count von Labenstein, and many others. Looking toward the door, Labenstein said to Kate, "One old friend seems guilty of the bad taste of having forgotten you, Mrs. White. Mr. Kemper sees only Miss Lockhart." Turning her eyes in the direction indicated, Kate saw Florence and Mr. Kemper engaged in animated conver- sation. Her companion directed his remarks to other subjects; but she kept her eyes fixed with a sad gaze upon her former lover, till startled from her reverie by the voice of her mother. "Yes, dear, Miss Lockhart dresses very prettily in- deed; with extreme taste; but this is not the moment for reflection on that subject. You have not answered the Count for several minutes. Confess, and perhaps he will forgive you. Ladies are excusable for abstraction as regards other things when the subject of dress is under consideration ; or, if not really excusable, they gen- erally consider themselves so. Have you not observed the weakness, Count?"And having given her daughter time to recover herself, Mrs. White passed on.  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7897-00000073"/> "-      LEFT TO HERSELF. Mr. Kemper had loved' ate; but when she married, he threw away neither himself nor the legacy that would have bought hinm a bride. He suffered much, but closed his lips and calmly went his way; never asking sym- pathy, never gratifying curiosity; working for work's sake; not content to renounce all things else because he had failed to win a woman's hand. He had just been introduced to Florence, and was greatlv attracted by her simplicity of manner, that never decgenerated into insipidity; her repose, which never be- came dullness; her dignity, which was not hauteur. Her manner was that of one who could boast of gentle blood and an honored name; the manner of one who owned as a birthright ease , dignity, noble bearing. Yet there was, withal, an absence of that absolute self-confidence, that easy assurance, which constant intercourse with fashion- able society rarely fails to confer-a polish which Flor- ence very innocently desired though much better without it; as if a rose should bend its sweet head, and sigh with envy over the brass and irons in the fireplace below. So Florence and Mr. Kemper talked on, mutually in- terested; while Kate listened to the Count von Laben- stein, and Frank tried to persuade himself that he cared no longer for his former love, nor felt himself an injured man when she seemed interested in another. Edward Bertnord approached Edith, and was accosted with, "Have you, then, stopped laughing at Mr. Hale? You quiz him unconscionably, outrageously." "Oh, he-will thrive," said Edward, carelessly. "' Fools govern the world in purple,' says an eminent author; ' the wise laugh at them, but they laugh in rags.' Fools thrive at court, fools thrive in state chambers, fools thrive in boudoirs, fools thrive in rich men's legacies. Who is so beloved as a fool? Every rian seeks him, laughs at him   LEFT TO HERSELF.        145 and hugs him. Oh, motley's your only wear. I always find occasion to laugh consumedly when Hale and James begin to trot out their poor old jokes. If both were talking to you, it would be necessary only that you should say you were cold: Hale would immediately ad- vise James to hold down his head and let you warm your hands. To be sure, the paper in which that delectable piece of wit was promulgated should be consigned to some museum of antiquities; nevertheless Hale would be very sure to repeat it. I have heard him do so one thousand times. He has no mercy on his fellow-men." Edith laughed. "For my own amusement and to test your veracity, I will make the experiment." "James may resent the pleasantry, in presence of a lady." "Tant mieux. They have frequently had the honor of dancing with me, and never repaid me by a moment's entertainment." Takingc his arm, she approached Messrs. James and Hale, who, poor fellows, were gladly entrapped into con versation. At length, Edith pretended to shiver with cold; and the next moment almost screamed with de- light, as Mr. Hale said, "James, lower your head, man, and permit Miss Shelley to warm her fingers." Mr. James's face immediately became as red as his hair, and he "did not understand Mr. Hale."  Somewhat confusedly, Mr. Hale explained himself, and was "pro- tected only by the presence of a lady." Mr. Hale i" felt capable of protecting himself;"Mr. Bertnord entered his protest; while Edith, implicitly and somewhat contemp- tuously confident of an amicable adjustment, merely said, much to the indignation of these sanguinary gentlemen, in her playful, half-earnest manner, which never assured you whether she meant much or nothing, "Gentlemen, 13  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7897-00000074"/> "6       LEFT TO HERSELF. as I am not an early riser, you must not expect me on the field; but I shall not turn informer, so you need not apprehend a warrant of arrest. I hope to have the honor of dancing with the survivor to-morrow evening; and as you doubtless have wills to make, and letters to write, I will not detain you from the performance of so exhilara- ting a task." Taking Edward's arm, she sauntered off, and presently encountering Frank, described to him, with exaggeration intended only to amuse, the interview that bad just taken place. But he seemed to enjoy the relation less than she did, and suggested the possibility of an unpleasant termi- nation to the affair. This idea Edith refused for a mo- ment to entertain ; and piqued at his implied disapproval, resented it by continuing her promenade in apparently high enjoyment of the jest, which had now in reality lost all charm, leaving him to reflect at his leisure on woman and her degrees of womanliness. Considerably to Edith's disadvantage were his reflec- tions; for though in his present humor he thought little and cared less for Messrs. Janmes and Hale or their diffi- culties, he censured with great severity the unwomanly hardness of her conduct, and the carelessness with which she regarded his disapproval. This was the crowning fault; but here he was unjust, for Edith felt dissatisfied and unhappy, though too proud to own or intimate it. Better for her had she smothered that false pride and with womanly arts tried to win him back, for she had learned to count all things as nothing compared with his love ; and better for her had she bent her self-will to its rule, for thus perhaps she had really won it. But self- control she had never learned; self-sacrifice was an ab- stract idea; and, alas I how much need was she to have for both!   LEFT TO HERSELF.        147 To Edith alone did injury result from this idle jest, for Messrs. James and Hale lost nothing more than a night's sleep, very natural anxiety keeping them awake till the " wee sma' hours ayant the twal." They met! But Mr. Hale, before it might be too late, wished to correct one impression under which his friend James seemed to be laboring, and declared that when he said red hair he did not mean red hair, and though he could not retract what he had uttered, he must express his as- tonishment at the construction that his old friend seemed to have placed upon the word "red." With the air of a martyr he announced himself ready; but Mr. James, with tears in his eyes, pronounced the ex. planation satisfactory, and very truthfully declared that his feelings no longer prompted recourse to the code. So they returned to the city covered with glory. But who shall tell the zest with which for years it was their wont to mention " that morning when Hale and I went out to butcher each other?"Or who shall describe, in all its sweetness and intensity, the bond of union formed " that day when the affair between James and myself came so near proving fatal to both of us?f" ,  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7897-00000075"/> "8      LEFT TO HERSELF. CHAPTER    XVII. JUNIUS hath it that instinct is truth; and instinctively, though vaguely and without being able to account for it to herself, Edith began to feel that her betrothed was not hers in very honesty of soul. Perhaps her restless, exacting nature unfitted her for perfect trust, even in one who loved her well; perhaps her reading, which continually pre- sented scenes of jealousy, scheming, and revenge, would have produced a disposition to suspicion, even where no cause existed; or perhaps Frank did not conceal, as he could have wished, the fact that she often failed to please, to satisfy/'to suit him, to fill his heart with content, to warm it into happiness. Whatever the reason, she sometimes felt, not that she had lost his love, only the shadow of a fear that she might lose it, and an intense dis- like toward the only woman she had ever thought of as her rival. Hence she would have banished Florence from her sight and path forever; but this was impossible with- out the probable disclosure of feelings which she was loth to acknowledge, for Charles with persistent blindness used every effort to bring them into intimate association, convinced that he was giving pleasure and doing a real service to both,-to his sister more especially. A few evenings subsequent to the terrible massacre of Innocents which was to have been described in our last chapter, Charles and Edward Bertnord were walking to and fro the parlors at Mr. Shelley's, while Edith, curbing her impatience, smiled on the Count von Labenstein, and Frank listened to Mrs. Shelley, who asked whether he   LEFT TO HERSELF.        149 were fond of English peas, and thrilled his soul with a narration of Harry's exploits in the destruction of panta- loons, stating with equal accuracy and solemnity the number he had worn out since a year ago last March. John Lockhart entering, Charlie ceased his promenade, and, addressing his sister, said, "Edith, Ned has just been giving me an idea of the piece he suggested the other evening, and I think you will like it. As Florence is to be one of the dramatis personae, I believe I will go up for her, and we can all talk it over together. Who is at my uncle's, John?" "Only Mr. Kemper, I believe. Doubtless he would-" "Come, too. Of course he will; Ned, suppose you go with me." "I do not know your cousin." "Edith, suppose you write a.. " "Pray, suppose us no more suppositions, brother mine: I am not in a literary mood to-night. You can better say what I would write." "Only it would seem more cordial, more---" "Oh, consider yourself freighted with words of wel- come," was her smiling but unwilling answer. "Our cousin will not say us nay when she doth learn from lips heart-lessoned how we impatient wait upon her coming." "Lady, I go." And, with hand upon his heart, Charlie retreated backward from her presence. Arrived at Mr. Lockhart's, and using her name more unsparingly than Edith would have deemed at all neces- sary, Charles induced Florence and Mr. Kemper to return with him. She was soon at her ease, for all received her with great apparent cordiality, and " like bird to sunshine fled she to a smt;le," depending, indeed, too much for the sun. 13*  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7897-00000076"/> 150      LEFT TO HERSELF. shine of her life on the smiles of those aroutd a Il ; ir too easily chilled aqd embarrassed by their coludness. Frank alone was silent; but when her eves met his, she saw no coldness there; only a quiet sadness, which, having once learned so well to read his face, she did not now fail to detect. This, however, neither chilled nor pained her. She said to herself, 1"He has not for- gotten me; does he love her?" "Edith loves him," said a still, small voice. "But so do I," her heart half whis- pered, and sent a blush into her cheek as the sign and witness of its truth. Unfortunately, not Florence alone had noted the re- proachful glance of those expressive eyes. Edith had been equally observant. Hitherto Frank had not deviated by word or look from -the manner of a mere acquaintance. He felt that, in dis- carding him as she had done, Florence had not only wronged but humbled him; and be had meant fully to convince her that humility was not his peculiarity, plead- ing not his forte; but, unconsciously, he had supported this resolve with the thought that he had no rival. Now Mr. Kemper's attentions served to dissipate that idea, and Frank's uneasiness convinced him that he had hoped for something, he scarce knew what; expected some- thing, he could scarce tell- why; for he had not dwelt upon the thought of breaking his engagenlent with Edith, and was not unmanly enough to desire that Florence should love him vainly; yet that he had really hoped to win her again he now acknowledged to himself, and that Edith was the barrier to all honorable effort he could not deny. He therefore contented himself with the mental assertion that he was an honorable man, and would act honorably, and consoled himself with the reflection that as she was " half in love with Kemper already, it   LEFT TO HERSELF.        151 could harm nobody but himself, if he chose to look at her." Frank was in love; but he was "a man for a' that;" and while we have been endeavoring to present a brief analysis of his feelings, he has become absorbed in a conversation with Mr. Shelley relative to the export of cotton. Edward Bertnord was saying, "Oh, the mechanical parts are easily arranged. Any schoolboy can tell you how to produce the lights; any fashionable mother will allow her baby to take ten drops of laudanum; any-one behind the scenes can pull the dark threads, which will be invisible to the audience, and, of course, the infantf- will seem to move of its own accord. Miss Lokhbart, do you sing?" "Yes," Charles answered for her. "Not by any means well enough to do so in public,' said Florence. "If singing is required of your good angel, allow her present representative to resign." "Only friends will be present," said Edith, "and the effect will be lost if one alone should sing." "Then, let me beg that you will supply my place with one who can better fill it, for really I do not sing well enough to justify the attempt," said Florence. Mr. Shelley left the room, and Frank drew near, but, without entering into the conversation, devoted himself apparently to the examination of some curiosities from Japan. Edith still urged that Florence should sing; and Florence, much embarrassed at seeming willfully to be- come an obstacle to their pleasure, was almost persuaded to yield her judgment to their wishes, when the Count, taking for granted that she sang well, or her cousin would not be thus importunate, said, kindly,-  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7897-00000077"/> 152      LEFT TO HERSELF. "Sing us one song, Miss Lockhart, and we will decide for you." "I am ashamed to sing in Edith's presence, having heard so much of her excellence as a musician. I should never dare to sing with her. I am so sorry to mar your pleasure in this wav. I did not understand what was expected of me. It is surely not too late to ask some one else." Seeing her embarrassment and annoyance, Mr. Bert- nord assured her that it was not necessary she should sing; it could be arranged otherwise without difficulty; but Edith, who knew that Florence could never hope to rival her in this department, and must show to great disadvantage, still insisted that she should adopt the original r6le. "Not if she dislikes it so much, Edith," said Charles. "But, judging from what you have said, Charlie, she underrates her own abilities, and has too high an appre- ciation of mine; so we will compel her to the juste milieu." "Let us hear you both, then. Come, Florence." With a flushed face and trembling fingers she sat down to the piano; but the keys looked not like old friends; they stared up at her with an unfamiliar aspect, and an- swered to her touch with uncertain, faltering voices. "Edith, lead the wav," said Charles, "and give Flor- ence time to gather up her courage." Edith sang; but so indifferently that Florence was astonished at the reputation she had gained, and con- cluded that her own embarrassment and alarm had been superfluous. While she sang, Frank looked keenly at her, then turned away, and again bent over his Japanese toys. It was evident to-him that Edith was endeavoring to entrap Florence into singing, and he was astonished that   LEFT TO HERSELF.       153 John did not put his veto upon it; but John knew nothing in the world of music, and had no doubt that Florence sang like an angel if Edith said so, while Charles really thought her voice delightful, and was sincere in his en- comiums. Of course Mr. Bertnord, Mr. Kemper, and the Count would not pronounce unfavorably, whatever opinion they might form of her musical accomplishments. The subject was reverted to in its original form. Edith again urged her plea, and Florence was about yielding unwilling assent, when Frank looked up and said, quietly, "Will you forgive my presumption, Miss Lockhart, if I advise that you do not sing?" "I thank you most sincerely, Mr. Muncair, for the kindness which prompts your candor." Frank continued: "Miss Edith is so far above the weakness of vanity that she does not see how gloriously nature has gifted her,rnd to-night she has generously refused to exhibit her full excellence and shine at the expense of another; but her amiability cannot always con- ceal the fact that no one in this city can pretend to com- pete with her in music, and, though I admire her delicacy, I would not advise that you defer to her judcgment,-a judgment biased by cousinly regard and the womanly desire to confer pleasure. Do you pardon my rudeness " "I gratefully acknowledge your kindness," she an- swered, "and adopt your advice." Edith had indeed brushed clothes with a most untoward fate when she induced, on Frank's part, a suspicion of any malicious manceuvre. He had thought her naturally too generous to take undue advantage of another,. and far too frank and brave ever to resort to subterfuge; but unless he were now grossly unjust, he had heretofore been greatly mistaken.  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7897-00000078"/> At any rate, Florence should not be imposed upon, when he could exert a protecting influence, for the love of justice and the memory of happier hours. If he sus- pected Edith unjustly, he would atone for it amply. If he judged correctly, he had a right to condemn severely. Deceitful? He looked at her-bright face, her sweet smile, her inno- cent eyes. Impossible I And whom was he suspecting? His betrothed. Whose wishes had he foiled? Those of his future wife, those of a woman who, whatever her faults, loved and trusted him. whom he had sworn to love and trust forever. He had disappointed her for the sake of one who had suspected and rejected him while he loved her most. But had she not had reason to do so? Had she too not loved andtrusted him? Had he not seemed false to her? Did not his present position tend to prove it? And was she not a good, true woman? Did not her reliance on his candor, her, belief in the kindness which prompted an apparent rudeness, prove that she was forgiving and unsuspicious? Heigho What was the use of thinking about it? With a sigh of dissatisfaction, he seated himself by Mrs. Shelley, and was asked whose make of needles his mother preferred. But a dangerous bond of union had been formed when he assumed the office of protector. Florence had too much good sense not to see wherein she was deficient, and when she would appear to disadvantage; but she had also too little selfishness persistently to assert the rights which she felt belonged to her, and too little self-reliance for determined opposition to this united host, whose judgment was, perhaps, superior to her own, and whose kindness she did not doubt. She was, therefore, really grateful for so efficient an Mly as Frank had proved him- self, and once or twice afterwards, when some point rela-   tive to herself was under discussion, she turned her eyes toward him with a tacit deference to his opinion, which flattered and pleased him not less than it incensed Edith. Florence, however, had not intended to excite these feelings in either of them; her principal thought now was to perform creditably the part assigned her, and her only motive in appealing to Frank arose from the conviction that he would know and say how much she could safely undertake. She did not, as Edith believed, cast this questioning, half-timid look at Frank with any design to captivate; for she had formed no plan to win hilm back, rarely, indeed, acknowledging to herself, as on the night when she had first seen him in New Orleans, how much she still loved him. But despite himself Frank was drawn within the magnetic circle. Had Edith imagined the per- plexity and disquiet of his soul, she could not have so well dissembled the jealous anger that sparkled in her eyes and sent its crimson tide into her cheeks; but she little knew how much she had to fear, and directed all the vio- lence of her feelings against the designing woman she supposed Florence to be. At length the Count said, in relation to some subject under discussion, "Really, Miss Lockhart, you must take my advice this time. Mr. Muncair may be your chosen ally, but, I assure you, he is not your only friend." Seeing that she was disconcerted, and about to reply with embarrassment, Frank observed: "You flatter me, Count; I have not the advantage of being a chosen ally. Miss Lockhart kindly and gracefully submitted to my in- terference, but I imagine she did so more from a paralysis of will, produced by astonishment at my impertinence, than from any reliance on my qualities as an ally. Is it not so, Miss Lockhart?" "You deserve a more flattering answer, Mr. Muncair;  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7897-00000079"/> 156      LEFT TO HERSELF. but I fear that my high appreciation of your judgment was based on the fact that you thought exactly as I did." "Thank you," be replied. "Had I differed with you, thel, my judgment would have gone for naught You emulate my candor." "Don't be quarrelsome, Muncair," said the Count, mischievously. "Where such unity of sentiment exists, as is evidently the case between Miss Lockbart and your- self, why suppose anything less delightful? What is it? Two souls with  ' What do I mean, Miss Edith?-you are responsible for my English." "Ingomar is not an English play; so I may not re. member correctly myself. But doesn't it run thus? 'Two heads-souls,' I mean, 'with but a single thought; Two-' really I forget,--' two tongues that speak as one,' I think it must be. See how spiteful I am, Florence; and all because you reject my counsel and refuse my advice. I am mortified into becoming your enemy." Edith spoke with an arch playfulness of manner which divested the speech of all appearance of rudeness. "I will not provoke you further, then, by comment on your travesty," was Florence's good-humored reply. "But, as Mr. Muncair was equally implicated, you refer her to him, Miss Lockhart,--do you not? Which is a further illustration of the beautiful sentiment Miss Edith so unmercifully parodied." -And the Count laughed as he caressed his beard. "Oh, Mr. Muncair can defend himself, no doubt. I had rather live to fight some other day," said Florence. "Of course, Count, my feelings are in unison with those of Miss Florence; so you may consider the affair amica- bly adjusted, and can conscientiously drop the subject." The Count understood what was demanded of him, and refrained from further teasing; but because he now conm-   LEFT TO HERSELF.        157 prehended that it might really be unpleasant to a lady, not, by any means, in obedience to the quiet command which spoke in Frank's eyes, and was perceptible through the jesting tone that he assumed. Labenstein was no coward, and liked Mr. Muncair little enough to be easily provoked into hostility. And though in deference to Miss Lockhart he did drop the subject, Frank's manner had irritated him, and the thought of it rankled in his bosom. Frank was no less incensed at Labenstein's presump- tion in attempting to tease Florence, for she no longer asked his advice by word or look,-a change to which he unwillingly submitted, and for which he was duly grateful to the Count as its author. He had found it very sweet, and a pleasant reminder of other days, to see her turn to him with the confiding smile which a year ago had always answered to his glance; but now the spell was broken, and she appealed to him no more. "Mr. Kemper," she presently said, " we will go now, or it will be too late for our game of chess." "Do you play, Miss Lockhart?" asked Labenstein. "I somewhat pride myself on that accomplishment, and should like to give you battle." "I fear you would find in me a foe not worthy of your steel; but your challenge shall be accepted, unless you withdraw on Mr. Kemper's representation. He says I play very badly." "Pardon me, Miss Florence, I think I said' recklessly,'  interposed Mr. Kemper. "Perhaps it was. Badly, or recklessly, or horribly, or something equally mortifying," she replied, not at all de- lighted at the idea of cultivating the Count more inti-. mately.  "Perhaps Mr. Kemper distracts your attention by "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7897-00000080"/> irrelevant remarks, Miss Lockhart. For a time, at least, I can promise not to startle you by conversation so inter- esting as to. render you incautious in your moves," Labenstein replied. "Strike your colors, Florence,"- said Charlie. "Phre- nological development is against you, little woman. Not so little either, by way of parenthesis. Caution wanting, decidedly." "I protest a gainst your judgment and denounce phre- nology. John, defend me. Do I play recklessly?" "You play rapidly." "But recklessly, I asked." "Well, no; we will compromise and say somewhat in- cautiously, since you have resolved to defend yourself; though a moment ago you spoke as recklessly as Mr, Kemper says you play." "I meant to compliment you as a woman, Miss Flor- ence, if not as a chess-player," Mr. Kemper said. "I feel a great aversion to cautious, calculating women, and can hardly tolerate the characteristic, even in so slight a matter. I insist that no defense is necessary." Frank could "hardly tolerate" the tone of interest with which Mr. Kemper spoke, and turning suddenly from Mrs. Shelley, said, "A year ago, Miss Florence, you played well; or have you forgotten that I sometimes had the honor of testing your skill?" But a clear, cool glance met his, and she replied with calm politeness, "Certainly not, Mr. Mincair; I am not so ungrateful a pupil." "Did he teach your young idea how to shoot in that direction?" asked Charlie, as he folded her mantle around her. "Yes; I am indebted to him for the proficiency which Mr. Kemper so willfully denies that I possess."   "'Allow me, then, to make my own decision, Miss Lockhart," said Labenstein. "( With pleasure, whenever you wish it. Good-night, Mrs. Shelley. Edith, good-night." John and Labenstein were talking to Edith as Florence turned to say good-night to Frank, Charhe was with Edward Bertnord in the' hall, Mrs. Shelley was urging Harry to bed. Frank bent over the hand extended toward him, and asked, in a low tone, "May I, too, test ?" but Mr. Kemper approaching at the moment, he stopped abruptly and turned away with a simple good-night. "Get up, Harry, or I will make Jim take you up." "Stop a minute, aunty, I'll wake him." And Charlie, with a lamp-lighter, commenced teasing the unhappy boy, while the Count looked on laughing. "I thought you said you did not play chess?"Edith was saying to Frank. "I do not." {"My cousin says you taught her to do so." "And says truly, dear Edith; but do I necessarily play now?" "Why have you given it up? And why have yoft not taught me, when you know I wish to learn?" "I had something more important to teach you," was his conciliatory reply. "Besides, your desire to learn was a mere whim, and you had neither time nor patience to gratify it, living as you do in a round of gayety. Miss Florence was the resident of a quiet village where I hap- pened to be visiting; she had no -excitement, few pleas- ures, and could therefore afford to learn chess. Are you satisfied?" "' And, I suppose, you have abandoned the game be- cause the memory of your village pupil is so associated with it that now--" f  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7897-00000081"/> "Your usual perspicacity is not at fault, my fair in- quisitor. Of course, I have given up chess because, having once had the pleasure of playing with Miss Flor- ence, all other pleasures prove insipid." "All other pleasures?" "Certainly. Is not that the confession to6which you wish to drive me? Indicate your will and I obey it." "A most complaisant gentleman and gallant knight. I am much beholden for your courtesy," she answered. "Why," he exclaimed, laughing, "who can fathom the nature of a woman? I but follow the bent of your will, and look on a curling lip. In the words of your song, 'Say, dearest, what wouldst thou have more?' Shall I say that in my efforts to instruct your cousin I became so weary of chess as never to have played since?" "I would not have you draw so freely on your imagi- nation. Do not say it, as it would hardly approach the truth." "Would it not?" "Would it?" "Ah! thou true descendant of Thomas I As John Randolph once said: ' Sir,' or' Miss' in this case, ' that's a question.' -In agreeing with you I failed to please; now I shall oppose you, and see if I act " "Conscientiously in both instances, Mr. Muncair, I have no doubt." She continued, with ill-concealed chagrin, "You have the happy art of seizing the right moment, for--" "Evidently not for saying good-night, my Edith, or I should have left " "When Florence did, I suppose, which would " Fortunately for her Labenstein joined and interrupted them. "Kemper has excellent reason for disliking cal-   culating women, has he not, Miss Edith? Was not his lady-love of that stamp?" "No; but her mother was. Kate was childishy void of ordinary reflection," said Edith. "I don't think so, Edith," said Charlie, as Harry awoke with a startling groan. "She has been in leading-strings all her life, and cannot determine her own path now, that is all." "She is a broken-hearted woman at all events," said Frank. "The worst of it is that everybody knows it," said Edith; "every one is speaking of it. She is but a poor actress." "And that you consider the worst of it?" asked Frank. "Yes; the greatest misfortune that can befall a woman is for the world to say that she loves vainly; the next greatest is that it should be true. But, if true, why let the world know it-a careless crowd of merry-makers? I sorrow, but if I keep time to their music and laugh when they jest, what more would they have?" "Mrs. White," rejoined Frank, " may well exclaim,- 'Oh, memory! thou ling'ring murmurer Within joy's broken shell, Why have I not in losing all I loved Lost thee as well?' But a truce to sentiment. Good-night, Miss Edith.'? Labenstein alone remained. He stood before her, his arm resting on the mantelpiece. Presently he said, "You told me you were not engaged to Mr. Muncair.?' "I did," she replied, exerting the self-control which she had found so necessary and so difficult many times that evening. "Do you repeat it?" he asked. "I do." "*  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7897-00000082"/> "Truthfully ?" "Do you mean to insult me, sir ?" And she arose haughtily. " You know I do not. You know, also, how impa- tiently I have awaited the departure of the rest that I might see you alone.  Forgive me if I have seemed rude; but it is best that we understand each other at once. Will you be kind enough to take your seat?" She stood a moment, then resumed her position, pre- pared to listen and determined to deceive. " You repeat that you are not engaged to Mr. Mun- cair ?" "I do. For Heaven's sake, don't ask me that again 1" "Nor to John Lockhart ?" "I am not. How could you think so ?" "I was only half in earnest about him." "There are other gentlemen in New Orleans. Name them by all means." "Why do you dislike your cousin, Miss Lockhart ?" She was surprised into hesitation; and he asked, with a steady gaze, " Is it because he loves her, as this even- ing I saw that he did ?" It were impossible to describe the fierce blaze of jeal- ousy which, long smoldering, broke forth at his words and scorched her soul with its angry flame,-burnt into her heart with its forked tongues. ,h-were equally impossible to tell of her anger, not at the Count's impertinence,--that was relatively of no moment,-but toward the man who had seen what she would have died sooner than believe. Woman as she was, she could have struck him; woman as she was, she called up her pride, and smothered her emotion, but turned pale in the mighty effort. Labenstein in turn was startled.   LEFT TO HERSELF.   163   "So," he said, in a low tone, and speaking slowly,- "so, you have deceived me, and I sit here, despised, as your dupe. Duped by a woman,--the woman I loved 1" "What do you mean?" she asked, with renewed self- possession. "I mean that you have not told me the truth. I mean that you love Frank Muncair." "From what do you infer that ?" "From your pallor, your agitation a moment since, when I said he loved your cousin." "Pardon me," she answered, coolly. " I did not under- stand you to say anything of the kind. I thought you said Mr. Lockhart loved her." "Miss Edith " he incredulously exclaimed, and was silent a moment, hardly daring a second time to accuse her of deception. " But what if Mr. Lockhart does love her? Why should that blanch your cheek ?" "In the first place, I like him-as a kinsman; you know I have so few." "Nor is he one; but go on." "And I do not like Florence, because I have reason to think her a forward, designing girl; therefore I do not want him to marry her. In the second place, I have vowed a vow that he shall fall in love with me, and laid a wager to that effect. So you see I am determined that he shall not love her." "Honestly, did you think I spoke of John Lockhart ?" "I did, indeed. You know you asked if I were en- gaged to him. But I will no longer be catechized. You have no right to question me thus." "I have. My love for you gives me the right." "Do you love me really ?" she asked, with an innocent, almost childlike, look of wonder. &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7897-00000083"/> 164      LEFT5 TO HERSELF. "Ah, Edith!" he answered, with reproachful tender- ness, "you can never affect to doubt that." "Indeed, that doubt led me to break my engagement with you." "And can you give me any idea of the means by which you were led to entertain it?" "Why, your utter want of confidence in me was suffi- cient to make me doubt your love. It was wounding, humiliating. I may have appeared cold sometimes ; but I am not always irq the same mood, and thought you loved me well enough to endure that. With others I think it necessary to enact my role of gayety, interest, etc., and to you only have I been unreservedly my natu- ral self, looking sad when I felt so, laughing if I wished, jinging or silent as my mood prompted. This, under- stand, was in the days of yore. I do not love you now; but the fault was your own." "Forgive me; pray forgive me, Edith I I see it was. o' I was an idiot. Only look upon me with the same feel- ings,-and, though you never speak to me again, I will still be your slave." "One moment.  You cannot doubt that I loved you once. My letters, continued for two years, and written with perfect unreserve, convince you of that, I am sure. But with me love and confidence are sy- nonyms. Did I discard you, Wilhelm, till you doubted me?" He almost laughed. "Edith, are you jesting, or is this really only a woman's way of reasoning? If cause and effect were ever more thoroughly confounded, I was not there to see." "Yes, I discarded you because I could not bear to be doubted when I knew myself sincere. You will not be- lieve I love-you if I attempt to please another. That is   LEFT TO HERSELF.       165 unreasonable; and no woman who loves attention, as I confess I do, will submit to it." "I am dumb forever on that point," Labenstein replied. "I hope I may leave the prisoner's box now." "No; I have lightning in reserve; then, perhaps, the moral atmosphere will be purified. You have my picture ; my letters. You threaten to show them. You menace me. You hold them over me in terroremn. Do we love stern masters? What injury to me if you do show them? None. I am certainly somewhat ashamed of them, but even to be despised were not to be wretched. But ask and answer for yourself, how must your threat- ening affect your position in my esteem? You may scourge a slave into submission; you cannot force a woman into loving." "Forgive me, I beseech you; but oh, Edith, I so love you that I would threaten anything, resort to anything, rather than lose my claim on you." "You so love me that you would do me an injury to prove it; granting that to show my letters would be doing me an injury." "You shall have your letters." "I do not want them, Wilhelm," she answered, softly, repressing the triumphant smile that would have played upon her lip. i"Yes," said he, " though I prize them above all things I have, save your picture, I beg you to take them. Your picture too, if you will, that you may see how far I am from sincerely contemplating any unkindness toward you." "Your return of them would prove that, I know; but as the power to harm me exists only in your own im- agination-- " "Let me, at any rate, prove the innocence of my inten.  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7897-00000084"/> 16i6      L  T :lU IE'L,'zS,.  - tions. You have spoken frankly and kindly as of old, while your manner permits me to hope--much. Let me give you back your letters. Do not deny He the privilege of raising myself in your estimation," urged Labenstein. "As you choose, Wilhelm. As I said before, the letters have for me no value; but if it will be a gratifica- tion to you to prove that you do not desire even the power to wound me, I will not deprive you of it." He bent and kissed her hand. "You are an angel I Henceforth I am blind, deaf, dumb; an automaton, in all save my love for you. When may I come with the letters? I am now as anxious to give them up as I was once eager to receive them." "To-morrow, at twelve; a half-hour shall most will- ingly be devoted to you. At one, I must fufill an engage- ment with Mr. Lockhart to visit " "A charity school?" he asked, rising. "No. An exhibition of paintings. Entre nous, the latter is in much better accord with Mr. Lockhart's taste, as well as my own. What a shame that he should sacri- fice himself so completely!" "Pardon me, I do not view the sacrifice as by any means complete, since he repays himself by spending half his time with you. I also will attend charity schools and visit paupers if you will therefore allow me the privileges he seems to claim." "You are not my cousin; I have not wagered that you shall love me; and you are not sacrificing yourself as he is," she answered. i' In the event of such a wager you would inevitably lose, dear Edith, as one who bets upon a certainty; and I willingly yield him the privileges of a cousin, daring to hope that I may win my own in a different character. Good-night." And he again pressed her hand to his lips.   LEFT TO tIERSELF.       167 As she heard the door close behind him, she threw herself on the sofa with a sigh of relief and a smile of satisfaction. When first engaged to Frank, on the appearance of Labenstein in New Orleans, she had felt some uneasiness concerning those letters, for they had been written by way of amusement, for herself and Mademoiselle Vansi, both desirous of an episode in which Madame la Mere was not to figure. Hence the tone adopted was con- siderably more ardent and extravagant than either of the girls would have chosen had she been in earnest or alone; and Edith recollected enough of them to know that they would be highly displeasing to one holding the fastidious ideas concerning women which characterized her present lover. Even more than his disapprobation on that head, however, she feared his contempt should he discover that she had been guilty of a falsehood, in saying once that she had never been engaged; subse- quently leading him to believed that she endured the Count's presumption only for love of Madame Vansi, the Count's friend. She well knew that Frank would not tolerate deception in a woman, however he might him- self be tempted to deceive; and that the purity of char- acter considered by him essential in his wife would in- clude "such presence of mind, that the thought of absolute truth should so preoccupy her as to defy surprise and anticipate the most hurried utterances." But she was not such a woman; and so warped was now the innate frankness and bravery of her nature that she hardly desired to become such; contenting herself with the simulation of any appearance pleasing to Frank. Then ber thoughts reverted to Florence, with bitterness ap- palling in a woman so young and so fair. She arose, tnd walked hurriedly up and down the room,--the love- I          &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7897-00000085"/> 168      LEFT TO . HERSE iF. liest thing in it, though wealth and art and taste had presided over its -adorning; the loveliest thing there, though her flashing eyes were half closed, though her teeth were clinched in anger, though the waves that crimsoned cheek and lip were hot with jealous race. At the present moment, her love for Frank was over- shadow'ed by the burning hatred she had conceived for Florence; by the emotions of scorn and resentment- more violent than most people can fully conceive of, much less feel or yield to-with which she thought of the woman who could dream of wresting from her grasp that which had become dear as her life,-the love she gloried in. She loved Frank, undoubtedly; loved him with all the ardor of a warm and vigorous nature. She loved the -handsome, gifted man, whose devotion was a source of pride; the man who had never yet thwarted her wishes or disappointed her expectations; the man who had never yet required of her any sacrifice of pride, or patience, or pleasure. Under great excitement, she might have died for or with him; her mind being familiarized with the contemplation of such dramatic events, and having no restraining principle save that natural dread of death, which is so often overcome by some strong, sudden im- pulse. But had he- become disabled,would she have deserted the world for him? had his temper become soured, would she have sweetened their life with tender tones and patient smiles? had he disputed her will, would she have yielded without repining? had poverty become his lot, was she one to lay her head upon his breast and be content? Who can think so as now she paces her elegant rooms, their broad mirrors reflecting at every turn the artistic adornment of her person, the glorious beauty of her form   X169 and face, the movements, the expression, that proclaimed the ill-directed-energy of her nature? And Florence, so wrongfully suspected, so unjustly arraigned, asleep in her snowy bed, a flood of moonlight rippling across her pillow, lay -forgetful of her lover, unmindful of her foe; dreaming sweetly of her far-off home. She, too, loved. Not so warmly as a year ago; but even now, had disease and poverty laid upon him their repul- sire hands, no hospital sights or sounds that he must endure would have proved unbearable by her; no allure- ments of the gay world, no remembrance of its many charms, could have taken her from beside the cot whereon he lay. Had his mind become embittered, his temper soured, she would have borne it patiently, and hoped for sunnier hours; had he opposed her will, or thwarted any wish, if he but did it lovingly, she would have yielded willingly, and found recompense ia the pleasure of pleasing him. CHAPTER     XVIII. NEXT morning brought the Count, and the Count brought the letters. Alh, how glad she was as he delivered them into her hands I She looked into his face with her head thrown back, thanking him with a triumphant smile;-and Laben- stein read in her eyes an expression of mockery which awakened unpleasant thoughts, and which he would fain have had explained. But too late, Monsieur le Comte, for Mrs. 'White and her daughter advance from the doorway, and now your fair hostess is engaged in their '15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7897-00000086"/> t. To late or yu to do augh    t bt pndr  reception. Too late for you to do aught but ponder on  her meaning, and wonder if indeed you are betrayed. Kate was very silent; and as she looked around on  the once familiar rooms, so redolent of love and happi- ness, sat nervously clasping and unclasping the pink coral on her wrist. Presently it fell to the floor, and Labenstein, on picking it up, remarked upon the beauty of its design, asking Edith, at the same time, if he had not heard her mention some ornament recently sent her by Madame Vansi. She assented; and Kate, by way of saying something, expressed a desire to see the orna-  ment in question. Edith left the room to bring it, and immediately on her return John Lockhart was an- nounced. As the ladies rose to leave, the Count also made his  adieux to Edith, and escorted them to the carriage. Hardly, however, had he made his parting salute to Mrs. White when Edith, after a hasty glance around the room, sent a  servant to ask that he would return for a moment; and, excusing herself to John, met him in the hall. ' Excuse me, but where are those letters?" she hastily  inquired. Mrs. White has them, I believe," he coolly answered.  "You are jesting, of course." "I am not. They were on the sofa where we had been seated before you left the room, were they not?" "Yes, you know they were. Where are they now?" "In the pocket of Mrs. White's velvet cloak; unless she has removed them since she left your parlor. I was talking to Mrs. White, junior, and apparently engaged in the examination of her bracelet, when the senior lady was sufficiently absent-minded--" "Nonsense, Wilhelm  You are, you must be, jest- ing 1"   "EP TO0 HERSELF.       " "Indeed, dear Edith, I am not. Mrs. White saw the letters addressed by you to myself; she saw that they had been written some time ago, and that it was evident I had returned them. She may have felt some curiosity as to the relations existing between us, and there were the letters for future reference." "Incredible I" "Thank you. Whom, then, do you suspect ?" Yourself." "I forgive the insult, knowing that you will presently see the injustice of which you are guilty. Why should I have resorted to subterfuge, if I wished to retain your letters? Had I not before refused to give them up? Were they not still my own ? Did you not bid me keep them ? Upon my honor, dear Edith, I saw that woman take them; but she did it so stealthily that I could not prevent it without rudeness of which even a peasant would not be guilty. Do you believe me ?" " Certainly," she replied, though with a mental reserva- tion not in his favor. "But Mr. Lockhart will conclude -that I have forgotten him. Good-morning." She re-entered the parlor in no enviable frame of mind, never for a moment doubting that Labenstein had repos-- sessed himself of his evidence against her. But custom is omnipotent, and John discerned no shade of perplexity on her features, no tone of vexation in her voice, as she apologized for her abrupt exit, and claimed another brief leave of absence that she might make some alteration in her toilet, when she would be ready to go with him to the art-gallery they had agreed to visit together. She had entered the carriage, and he had his foot upon the step, when a ragged child ran up, and shaking the skirt of his coat, exclaimed, "Mother wants you mighty bad, sir I"&#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7897-00000087"/> 172      LEFT TO HERSELF. "Very well; I will come after awhile," he answered, hastily, too well aware of Edith's aversion to contact with any of the class to which this child evidently belonged. "They say she's a-dyingo, sir. Can't you come now, please, sir?" "I shall be back presently. Run for Mr. Brown." "Mr. Brown is there, sir; but mother likes you the best. They say she's dying, sir; can't you come?"And the tearful little voice broke down-with a sob. Edith was touched and about to bid him go, but as she opened her lips the child added, "The lady is there, too, and said I must tell you to make haste, sir." "What lady?"Edith asked. "Florence," was John's reply; and for a moment he looked down with an air of anxious perplexity. Edith's native generosity would still have prompted her to say, "Go;" but now she became vexed and irri- tated. Dissatisfied with Frank, jealous of Florence, and suspicious of the Count, should she yield her influence over John Lockhart, and own that she had boasted idly when she said he should minister, not unto others, but to her; toil not for their salvation, but for her pleasure? Should he break an engagement with her because Flor- ence needed his services? abandon her society because Florence waited for him at the bed of a sick pauper? Nay, should she not rather, by alluring him from the path which Florence affected to think so holy, mortify her cousin as that cousin would have mortified her, and con- vince her of the superiority of those attractions which she hoped to rival? John's face flushed, and looking up, he asked, hesitat- ingly, "Cousin, will you think me very rude if I beg that you will wait for me an hour, or go with me to-morrow? You do not know how much pleasure to myself I ask you   LEFT TO HERSELF.        13 to defer; but doubtless the woman is dying; she was ex- tremely ill this morning " "And you are the only minister in New Orleans? or the wisest? or the best?" ' Far from it, cousin." "What, then, are your peculiar qualifications that you must needs go?-even granting the doubtful point-that any of your profession can be of service to the woman? She wants a minister, not John Lockhart; and if I am selfish, it is because I want John Lockhart, not an escort. " He smiled happily, but looked thoughtfully down again. When he raised his eyes a cold gaze met his own, and she haughtily ordered the footman to close the carriage door. Directing the child to the house of a neighboring minister, John sprang to his seat, Edith protesting against it, and begging him to use his own inclination in the choice of associates. "You are very unkind, cousin-" he answered. "I am not such a boor as willingly to break an engagement with any lady; certainly not with yourself; and I was not influenced by any sense of my duty as a minister when I proposed deferring our visit to the Exhibition; for, as you say, there are better men than I ready to go; but Florence is the lady of whom the boy spoke as being WEith his mother, and I was unwilling that she should be there alone." "Why does she go to such places? Had not these people much rather be without the presence of a lady who must force upon them a sense of their own inferiority? Why not enact Lady Bountiful only to the extent of send- ing the poor things money, food, and clothing, as other people do? I should feel a delicacy in making such in. trusive calls." 15* J   &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7897-00000088"/> 1J-4 i J!"..,    J.. u. v L/ LtI, . "None of your fashionable friends, dear cousin, are so gladly at home to you as are these poor people to Florence; for she has too much delicacy of feeling ever to wound it in another, however humble; and the supe- riority that she exhibits is of a nature to awaken affection only, so gentle is she, so kind, so full of sympathy ; albeit so unconscious of her excellence." "But how can a lady like to associate with coarse people and visit their untidy homes?" "No lady does like it for its own sake, and Florence certainly never throws herself into contact with them unless there is a real necessity for it; but when she can do good to others she is always ready to sacrifice herself." Then he sighed, and added, somewhat irrelevantly it seemed, "She is acquainted with Mr. Brown." With only too much success Edith now exerted herself to convince John that if he had neglected his duty he had not done it vainly; if he had wounded Florence, he was prospering in his love. Every art, every wile, was exerted to make the hour pass pleasantly, and John knew nothing save that Edith leaned upon his arm with a confidence she had never before exhibited; that her smile, as her eyes fell before his, was not the careless smile it had been her wont to wear; that, as she turned from others, her voice was low and her tone sweet as never before to hinm. He knew nothing, thought of nothing, cared for nothing, save that he loved her and might hope. He scarce looked at the pictures, or gave a greeting to his friends: there was a picture in his heart fairer than canvas might receive, and a friend dearer than all others. His only regret in leaving the works of art spread be- fore him arose from the necessity of leaving Edith; and when he parted from her at her own door, he felt as if some hand had shut the sunlight from his eyes.

I am sorry now    "Silence, I implore you No regrets must close a morning that has been to me so happy. Florence is not my ruler, and I will court her anger, if I may then claim your sympathy." "You can need no assurance of it." He walked buoyantly home and confronted Florence as he, eptered the hall. Absorbed in other feelings, he had hardly bestowed a thought upon the unkindness of which he might have been deemed guilty, or the derelic- tion of duty of which he might have been accused; but for a moment, as he stood face to face with the girl who had always found time to aid him, though, perhaps, to his knowledge sacrificing her own pleasure; with her who strove so faithfully to do her duty, and succeeded so far beyond what his weak endeavor had accomplished, a pang of self-reproach shot through his heart, and he felt abased in his own regard,--an unfortunate emotion just then, for it aroused toward Florence a feeling of defiant irritation, which, in its turn, awoke still greater tenderness for her in whose opinion he believed he held an exalted position; for her who never caused him a feeling of humil- iation, and never rebuked him for his wanderings in the paths of worldly pleasure. If he now expected reproof, he did so without the warrant of prevedent, and should have been disappointed, for Florence merely told him that his parishioner was dead, and added that she was sorry he had not been able to get there in time; but despite her inoffen- sive manner, he felt rebuked, and said, somewhat roughly, ':V.  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7897-00000089"/> 1776      LEFT T10 HERSELF. that he was sorry, too, but it could not be helped, and there was no reason why Mr. Brown could not attend the woman as well as he. She looked at him in surprise, and said she did not mean to intimate any accusation of neglect; she knew he must have had good reasons for his absence, and merely regretted that such had existed. He inquired what message from himself she had received, and Florence re- plied that the child gave none, as only a few moments before he got home his mother died, with the other children around her, and the poor little fellow seemed to think only of her death. Then she asked what message he had sent. John had neither the- patience nor the perseverance, neither the cowardice nor the littleness of soul, which go to form the character of the hypocrite. Leading the way into the sitting-room, he said, "I had an engagement with Cousin Edith to visit some paintings, and was at her house when the boy came for me. Of course I did not break my engagement with a lady, when another min- ister could be found." She was silent, and he went on: "AA man must be a gentleman as well as a minister of religion. You could not expect such a thing of me." Endeavoring to avoid a collision, she archly said, "An ambiguous phrase, John! What is it that I must not expect?" "Pshaw! You could not expect me, I say, to break my engagement with Edith, could you?" "Knowing her so well, John, being her cousin, and aware that the paintings will continue on exhibition for some time, you might very properly have done so, I think; but it is a matter in which you were right to judge for yourself. It is a pity that Edith did not see the child; she would then have released you, and spared any further embarrassment."   LEFT TO HERSELF.        1 It was now John's turn to be silent. Had the confes- sion her words might have elicited involved the acknowl- edgment of any misconduct of his own, it would have been much more agreeable to him doggedly to have made it and submitted to the consequences ; but to shield Edith, his lips would be closed forever. So he dropped the subject, kicked his uncle's dog, and finally availed himself of man's legitimate excuse for giving -way to his temper. Dinner was not ready. Verily, no man tamely waiteth for his dinner, though he be in love and his conscience hurt him sore. Again with Edith, he was again happy. She had been asking him what reception he met with from Florence, and could hardly believe that there was nothing to tell, that there had been no angry words spoken, no contemptuous look remembered. Her triumph, then, had not been so great, after all. She presently asked what course he would pursue if he had a friend whose cause was to be defended and he felt that he was not fitted for the task. Would he, to prove his friendship, still undertake the mission, or leave the cause in competent hands? The latter, of course. But, granting that numbers were needed, if he could not act so as to give an example worthy of entire imitation, were not his place better vacant? "Yes." 'u Cousin, granting that Jesus Christ is the Son-of God, do you believe yourself, fitted to advocate his cause? are you so good a man?" "I am not." "You are not. Even I have discovered how revolting to you are the scenes of squalid misery which you witness. How keenly must the people who needed your sympathy have felt the want of it I And were not this office yours,  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7897-00000090"/> it had perhaps been better filled by one differently con- stituted and better liked. God gave you a certain nature, and you have mistaken the method of its development. He has not given you strength to resist great temptation, yet you place yourself in such a position that those things in you become sins which in others are hardly faults; and you therefore willfully sin against Him whose cause you advocate, because you arrogantly assume a position which He never designed that you should fill. You have struggled hard to perform your office, and, according to your own preaching, He gives his chosen strength to do his will. Are you strong to perform your work?" Oh, weak, weak sophistry  Yet, betrayed by his treacherous heart, John bowed his face in his hands and listened. "As I said, cousin, even I, who feel little interest in the doctrines you teach, even I have seen how monotonous and wearisome to you are the duties you have undertaken to perform. You cannot conceal it; you have tried to the utmost, and you have failed. Do you suppose you have done no harm by this failure, if, indeed, you be preach- ing the truth? Do you suppose it has caused no corre- sponding coldness in the people whose souls you have undertaken to save? Can you be sure that you have kept from them no man competent and willing to be their pastor in very truth? You can enforce the example of a good man, but if religion be indeed what you say, dear cousin, you are not fitted to be its minister." "Edith, could you love any man well enough to be a minister's wife?"John asked. "No," she answered. But the conversation was hasten- ing toward a point at which she did not care that it should yet arrive; and calling to Mrs. Shelley, who was passing   through the hall, she addressed to her some remark which changed its current. On Tuesday morning of the week subsequent to the preceding conversation, our friends met at Mr. Shelley's for the purpose of rehearsing. Frank alone absented him- self. But as he proposed taking no part in the perform- ance, this was not a matter of vital importance to any save Edith and Florence, both of whom, it must be confessed, felt that the key-note had not yet been struck. Not unfortunate for them, however, his absence; for if it produced between them no harmony of feeling, it yet pre- vented the discord that had been imminent a few nights previous. We should be doing Frank some injustice were we to intimate that either amiability or vanity was the motive-power in this instance. Love-making was not the business of his life more than that of most men; and when he absented himself from, Mr. Shelley's, it was not with any regard to the probable feelings of either lady, but from the occurrence of a very matter-of-fact circum- stance, namely, that the sale of a large lot of manufac- tured tobacco, in which he was speculating, took place at the hour appointed for the meeting at Mr. Shelley's; and despite Mr. Day's tragic protest, Frank chose to give his attendance at the former. Meantime Edith was riveting her chains around John; Florence was looking on with painful interest while pretending to play chess with the- Count; Charles and Edward discussed politics; a few of the party were taking lunch; one or two more trying a new mazourka. Plainly the business of rehearsal was progressing in amateur style. On the evening of the performance, after Florence had dressed, she went to her mother's room, and was about   '&#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7897-00000091"/> asking gayly how she looked, when a sudden fear came over her, and she exclaimed,- "You are not well; not quite so well,--are you, mother?" "Not just now; but I shall be better presently. You look very sweet, my child. I hope you will enjoy your- self. God bless you." "I cannot go, mother. Please do not urge it. I shall not enjoy it if I go." "But, my dear child, I am nearly as well as usual; and it would not be right to disappoint your cousin. These amusements make up her sum of life, and she values them accordingly. It would mortify her to dis- appoint her guests; and even though you may not enjoy it, you must remember that your own are not the only feelings to be consulted. Put on your wrappings, Flor- ence." With a heavy heart Florence kissed her mother, and obeved. At Mr. Shelley's, finding her sad and silent, her friends left her in search of merrier companions; and she was sitting apart from them all, anxiously waiting for the curtain to rise that she might perform her task, and return to the sick-room at home. Edith was in her most brilliant mood, and had appar- ently captivated the attention of the little circle, when she discovered that Frank Muncair was neither listening to nor looking at her, but had taken his seat beside Florence, and though not conversing, was evidently not ennuye. Their words had been few; but they had opened the way for a dangerous rush of emotions. He had taunted her, in a jesting tone, with having been deserted by lovers and friends; but she was too sad to adopt a similar   strain, and replied by telling him how unhappy she felt concerning her mother, and how anxious she was to re- turn to her. As she spoke, her lips trembled, her eyes filled, and she looked anxiously toward the tardy per- formers. He started up, saying, that though he hoped her anxiety would prove groundless, she must not be permitted to make such a sacrifice of feeling; he would explain to Miss Edith at once; but Florence detained him, saying, that her mother had wished her to come, and might perhaps be injured by such a manifestation of alarm on her part. He--yielded to her opinion, but left her for a few moments to hasten the movements of the actors, and returned with the assurance that everything was en train. It was during the long pause which followed that Edith first observed them, and felt that this silence was not the result of stupidity or indifference, but, as indi- cated at least by his manner, of a completeness of sym- pathy hardly requiring the aid of vocal utterance,--a perfectness of content hardly needing the ornament of word or gesture. Edith looked on, miserable and enraged, yet her laugh rang not less clearly; her eyes shone not less brightly; her wit sparkled not less freely; for though she loved her betrothed, society was her god ; and society, you know, does not tolerate evil passions. In fact, society is some- what prone to laugh at any show of feeling; and who so bold he feareth not a laugh? Not Edith Shelley, assuredly I She had been educated for society; she had lived for society; and she had no higher aim than to be a star in society. No principle higher than its dictates had she to govern her; no decree feared she, no scorn did she dread, save that of this ignoble idol at whose feet her immortal soul was prostrate. Yes, she loved 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7897-00000092"/> 182      LEFT TO HERSELF. Frank, but she stood in awe of the world, and dreaded its sneer more than she prized his smile. Frank at length spoke: "It grieves me, Miss Florence, more than I can hope you will believe, to know of your mother's illness. Her unvarying kindness to me rendered even brighter than they would otherwise have been the happy hours of my stay in Lorburg, and whatever else I may have appeared guilty of, ingratitude is not among my faults. I remem- ber her with respect and affection, and should long ago have testified it by visiting her, and in some manner at- tempting to requite the hospitality extended to me a year ago, but I knew that--I knew how little you now thought of me, and feared the reception I might meet" In her present mood she was easily affected by any allu- sion to her mother, and replied, with some effort, "Every- body has been-we have found a great many friends, and they have been very kind to us; but we did not know them at home. Mother would like to see you. She has so few' pleasures. I hope--"Her voice faltered, and seeing that she could hardly repress her tears, he again left her, and returned only to conduct her to the stage, confident that she would not mistake his motive in giving her a few moments' solitude. As she was about to take her place, Edith heard him say, u' Is it still your wish to act? Disappoint the whole set, and what matter? You owe them nothing. Tell me what you really wish, and I will see-- "They passed on. In the centre of the stage lay a child asleep on a bank of moss. Extending from the back of the stage to this bank, and made high enough to exclude the flickering glow from the left that illumined the right side, was a parti- tion, concealed by shrubbery and branches of trees. The compartment on the right seemed at first a wilderness of   LEFT TO HERSELF.        183 beauty; luscious fruits decked every bough, gorgeous flowers hun(g on every stem, and the bright red glow lent additional beauty to them all; but presently you saw that nettles grew thick where the roses were, that the bell-creeper poisoned the air, that serpents were twined on every bough, and reared their venomed heads from every flowery path. Around the red flames which they continually fed danced, with uncouth gesture and wild grimace, a circle of imps. Behind them hung a curtain, and, when this was stirred, the red glare gave a gro- tesque appearance of life to the skulls pictured on its black folds. From some invisible point a flood of pure, steady light irradiated the compartment on the left, making whiter still the fragments of white flint with which the floor was thickly strewn, and the blossoms that seemed to have sprung from between their crevices. Thorn-bushes grew thick around, and a rude wooden cross stood before the cloudlike folds of white gossamer that filled up the picture. Musicians were behind the curtain. "Why, what does this mean, Charlie?"i Frank asked. "Don't let them raise the curtain yet. This light will be out in five minutes." A servant standing by said, "Miss Edith done some- thin' to it jest now, and I ain't so certain as it's burnt good sence." "Its going out will place your cousin in a very ridicu- lous position, Charles; so you had better have the thing attended to." Frank waited to see that it was done, mentally asking, "Can it be possible that she did this thing with evil pur- pose? It is too contemptible. I once called her a lineal child of Thomas; but, if this be so, I wronged the  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7897-00000093"/> 184       LEFT TO HERSELF. fellow, for surely it was Judas." Frank pondered and was troubled. As the curtain rose, the two girls advanced toward the sleeping child: Edith, decked in crimson and gold, spark- ling with gems, laden with flowers, singing a wooing strain; Florence, robed with white gossamer, fair as a lily, pure as a pearl, silently clasping to her breast a silver --cross. Edith's song portrayed the pleasures that she would lay at his feet, the honors with which she would crown his life, the hopes that should all be realized, the ambi- tions that should all be gratified; and the infant extended its arms to. her; but as she sprang to receive it, Florence knelt and interposed the cross, while a strain of noble chords floated solemnly and sweetly on the air. Edith renewed her song; and, as Society sustained her here, she poured forth her soul in a volume of melody that entranced the audience and proclaimed her an artist indeed, if nothing more. As his tempter sang, the child pushed aside the cross, and seemed grasping at her flowers, when his guardian angel pointed toward the serpent concealed among their leaves, and the child again shrank back. Once more came those grand, simple chords, and the infant was folded in the protecting arms of his guardian angel. Then followed from the baffled temptress a torrent of wrathful imprecation; a fierce foretelling of temptation; a vindictive prophecy of sorrow, and the bidding of each imp to his task in the working out of this soul's destiny. Marvelous her voice, wonderful, indeed, those tones, but, to many, more astonishing still that talent for actingr which flushed her face, and knit her brow, and made the veins stand out like cords. But this was not acting, it   LEFT TO HERSELF.        185 was giving expression to a feeling which existed in all the intensity portrayed. For a few moments pending the next representation Edith was again the smiling hostess, receiving the en- thusiastic homage of her admirers. She had fairly won the sceptre to-night, and the devotees of talent as well as fashion offered acclamation. Even Mr. Shelley was grati- fied by the applause that was buzzed from lip to lip, and Charlie not quite in earnest when he said, "For Heaven's sake, sister, off with those lendings, and take to a bunch of keys! I assure you it is not respectable. In private life to act so well doth look but ill." "Such talent should not know private life. Miss Shel- ley, you were born for the stage; you were, indeed." The sentiment was re-echoed; and Edith, intoxicated by flattery, was really led to wish that her talents had a less limited sphere for display. "A message for Miss Lockhart,-her mother is ill," were the words that greeted Florence as she retreated from the stage. Instantly she ran through the hall, past the astonished servants; and, scarcely conscious of her movements, was on the portico when stopped by Frank, who had hastened after her. "Wait a moment," he said; and, though in a tremor of fear and excitement, she pa s- sively obeyed the tone of kind command, and allowed him to fold around her the shawl he had found on a chair. Then he silently led her to one of the carriages at the door, and, bidding the coachman drive as rapidly as pos- sible, took his seat by her side. He, too, had heard the mes- sage, and felt that words were useless; for nothing could comfort her except the assurance of her mother's relief, and that he might not give. So the silence remained un- broken, for, absorbed in the thought of her mother, she was hardly conscious of his presence. 16*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7897-00000094"/> 186      LEFT TO HERSELF. Frank sat beside the weeping girl, and longed to take her hand in his; to rest her head upon his shoulder; to whisper words of hope,-comforting, because she loved him; cheering, because she trusted him. Plunged in these thoughts, the moments passed rapidly, and when the horses stopped he looked up, surprised that they had so soon reached their destination. Hastily thanking him, Florence ran up-stairs and entered her mother's chamber. As- she did so, Amy, her old nurse, descended with her apron at her eyes, and Frank, who remembered her well, turned back to inquire if Mrs. Lock- hart was very ill. Amy had been Frank's stanch friend, never ceasing to question Florence as to the cause of his absence, or to reproach her for her supposed folly in discarding him. As he held out his hand she exclaimed, "Well, if it ain't Mas' Frank I Come in, honey; come in de settin'-room; thar ain't nobody here, and they'll want somebody 'fore day. Bless de Lord for sendin' somebody we knowed in old Virginny I Here comes Mas' John." John invited Frank to remain for a few moments, at least, and left him in the sitting-room, while he followed Florence into the chamber of her who had been to him also as a dear and tender mother. Frank wandered around the room. Here were books with her name on the leaf,-some they had read together; flowers, arranged by her hand, perhaps; notes of invita- tion, and her work-box, with its little gold thimble nestling amid the folds of lace. Shading his eyes with his hand, he yielded himself to the memories which these things awakened, and to thoughts that he dared not dwell upon as hopes. John, after awhile, returned. His aunt was better, but, he feared, only temporarily so. Frank expressed!the   LEFT TO HERSELF.        181 sympathy he felt, and offered to remain in the house, or render any possible service; but, for the present, John gratefully declined, promising to call upon him should occasion demand it. They shook hands and parted, with no thought of the gay belle whose fingers had woven a dark thread in either life. Frank grieved for Florence, so soon to know a mother's loss. John's heart ached as he thought of the tender care his aunt had given but never owed him; of the patience that all his willfulness had never tried too far ; of the almost maternal love that had been a safeguard to his steps, and that he was soon to know no more forever. As he re-entered the chamber of death, Mrs. Lockhart extended her hand, and he knelt to catch her words. Florence rested beside her, clasping the other hand. Mr. Lockhart made way for John, and stood at the foot of the bed. Amy sat in a corner of the room, weeping silently. "John," said his aunt, "I have sometimes felt that you were growing weary of God's service, and might be tempted to throw aside his livery; but, oh, my child I in an hour like this you will see how poor and worthless are the things that tempted you most. Ambition dare not whisper in the ear of Death, and the voice of Pleasure can entrance no longer the soul that is called upon to ap- pear before its Judge. My child, be true to God; be true to yourself. Flee from temptation, though your heart grow sick to yield. Though it pursue you unto death, resist it; strive against it; never cease to give it battle. Oh, my son, my son, do not barter peace of mind for an hour's revel with the world I God and your soul live forever: pleasure gilds a moment of our youth, and is gone." John bowed his head, and hot tears fell upon her hands.  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7897-00000095"/> Slowly the hours dragged by, and the gray light of morning stole coldly through the darkness of the night. Then the great city awoke to life, and the sun arose with his joyous beams, and the air was filled with busy sound, while slowly and still, in the chamber of death, the mo- ments were ebbing away. Carts rattled over the pavements; men shouted to each other across the street; the merry tone of schoolgirls rang upon the air; a servant passed beneath the window, sing- ing a popular air, and paused to speak, with a lau(gh, to a fellow-servant; the laugh was quickly smothered, and, after a few whisperings, the song was taken up in a lower tone; it grew fainter, and died away in the distance. Oh, the jarring of this busy life to watchers by a death- bed! A small timepiece struck the hour that had gone, and was already swiftly numbering the momlents of another, seeming to whisper, "Passing away I passing away!" and the words re-echoed through every chamber of the heart with fearful distinctness, "Passing away 1" Oh, the misery of those last moments, when you restrain your aching heart and keep down the expression of its anguish, lest you lose a look, a tone, that may be the last; when you meet the wandering, glazing eye; when you note the hue of death fast blanching every feature; when, for a moment, life seems to return, and the dear lips, in familiar tones, utter common household words; when the light again fades, and there are broken sentences addressed to the dead or absent, and the mind seems wandering back into the past I   LEFT TO HERSELF.       189 CHAPTER    XIX. kRS. WHTE was disappointed. Her son-in-law had not given her carte blanche in regard to money; often, indeed, to her astonishment, seeming at a loss for it him- self. At other times, after an absence of many days, he returned home with a full pocket. But his gains vanished, she knew not how, and he hardly cared to inform her. This was not what she had expected. Nor had she expected an ugly story that, one fine morning, reached her, concerning a forgery of Mr. Kem- per's name, verified by a note from her nephew, which found its way stealthily into the hands of his wife. A week before this pleasant revelation, Nicholas White had been accosted under the shadow of his own dwelling by a gambling acquaintance, who said, roughly, "See here, I don't intend to be put off any longer. If you can give such entertainments as these, and dress madam in feathers and diamonds, you can pay me my money, and I intend to have it; so look out for yourself. The stir about that forgery business is not' over yet, I can tell you, and I guess I should be pretty well paid for any informa- tion I might give." "I guess you would find yourself pretty well impli- cated," replied Mr. White. "It doesn't strike you, then, that Mead and Mason would protect an accomplice for the sake " "Confound you I dont talk so loud." And Mr. White cast a terrified look over his shoulder. "Well, I tell you I must have the money; and if I can't  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7897-00000096"/> yUf UI-J    .Lt' .It .gv:# V a .rf . . get it out of you in one way I will in another, so look out." "What do you expect me to do?"Mr. White angrily asked. "Wait till -"- "I have waited already, till I mean to wait no longer. You did the other very neatly, why not try it again?" "What I you don't mean  "        l "Yes, I do. Who will know but you and I?" "I don't exactly see how I can trust you," said Mr. White. "I don't exactly see how you can afford to break with me," was the sneering reply. "I'll see you again. I will try to raise the money; maybe I shall have a run of luck; but if I don't--" "Very good; we'll see." The result of this and similar conversations was the forgery of Mr. Kemper's name for a large sum, and the consequence of that transaction was the issue of a warrant of arrest against Nicholas Wbite, John Riggins, and Jack Harding. Kate sat with her face buried in her hands. Her hus- band's note lay beside her on the floor. Mrs. White stood near, heaping upon her son-in-law all the contumelious epithets that anger could suggest. "As Nicholas intimates in that letter, Kate, there is only one thing that can be done, and you must do it." "What is that, mother?" "Go to Mr. Kemper, or write to him, and ask him not to prosecute your husband." "Never!" said Kate. "Never will I humiliate myself for a man who is " "Your husband," interposed her mother. "Incapable- of guarding his own honor," continued Kate. "My husband I Truly the name is honored by its   -L-ia 'Iv ntIs OfLO vy.   191 holder when the wife must degrade herself for its pro- tection!" "It will hardly be so degrading as a visit to your lord and master in the penitentiary; and depend upon it, if once your shame is shouted into the ears of the world, the cry will be taken up and continued as long as there is one of the race to blush at hearing it." Kate was prevailed upon to make the appeal; but she yielded with many tears and a keen sense of the humilia. tion -to which she subjected herself. She had begged her mother to write; but the reply was, that Mr. Kemper had ever entertained toward her a most unaccountable dislike, and it would effect nothing, were she to write a thousand times. Kate then said, that she did not see why Mr. White should not make the application, since to do so would be no less mortifying to her than to him; but Mrs. White interrupted her impatiently: "Kate, if you intend to write, do it; if not, say so at once and be done with it. If you choose to see your family involved in disgrace, when you can easily avoid it, let them know it from the first, and not hope for any- thing better; but do not hesitate until it is too late, and then humble yourself without benefiting anybody. The longer you defer it the less probability there is that Mr. Kemper will be able to accomplish anything in our favor; for if the law be once allowed to take it in hand, Mr. Kemper's efforts will be futile. Nicholas, you see, says in this note that Harding will be brought before a magis- trate for examination to-morrow morning; and that if Mr. Kemper should consent to do anything for us, it will have to be done then.  I wonder where Nicholas has concealed himself?"' "Prosecute?-ha!"And the savage smile that accom-  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7897-00000097"/> 192       L;EFT TO HER SEL F. panied the words was evidence enough of Mr. Kempers intention. The friend who had questioned him was silent; moralizing on the excess of feeling aroused by the toss of a sum which the man before him would scarcely miss. He was not aware that thus Mr. Kemper hoped to pay a debt long owing; Mrs. White and her nephew being the creditors "Prosecute? Why not? Has the lion lain down with the lamb? No, my friend, Kemper doesn't stand praying in the market-place; andt, until he has a seat in the synagogue, he'll take revenge whenever he can,-all in the way of business.", But Mr. Kemper received a letter-one showing no careful arrangement of periods, no labored selection of words. The brief and often abrupt sentences, the effort to write calmly, evident in some passages, the abandon of feeling which betrayed itself in others,-all this made the reader look closely at its pages, searching for the trace of tears. Mr. Kemper judged that Kate had written of her own accord. It was evident that Mrs. White hal not been allowed to read the letter, for it contained allu- sions to the past-which that lady would not have per- mitted, and mention of occurrences which were best forgotten. With a shade of the old feeling, Kate ha&amp; held sacred from her mother the words intended for him il; and he now possessed the key to much that had been una intelligible. For more than an hour his office door was closed, and the man of business existed no longer. TheL he aroused himself. Mr. Kemper's first step was to see Jack Harding; his next, was to induce him to leave the State, should the magistrate accept bail; and the evidence against himn being slight, there was little doubt that this would be the case. Mr. Kemper offered to go security for the amount, which, in the event of Harding's flight, would be forfeited;   LEFT TO HERSEIF.       193 and he cared very little what that amount might be, as he intended that Nicholas White should refund the money. The bankers being unable to identify Mr. White, who was disguised when the draft was presented, a true bill could not be found, and there the case would end. Jack Harding having excellent reason to wish himself beyond the reach of law, acceded promptly to Mr. Kem- per's proposal; was examined, bailed, and very shortly after was beyond the limits of the State. Mr. Kemper was then enabled to reassure Kate con- cerning the security of her position in the eyes of the world. This he did in a few lines, calmly and, as it seemed to her, coldly written, but ending, with an assur- ance of good will, the sincerity of which he had already proved. Kate immediately advised her husband of the leniency so ill deserved; and in a few days he was again at home, creeping around every corner; sneaking through every thoroughfare;- dodging the sight of every broadshoul- dered man; dreading to meet Mr. Kemper; fearing to meet the man whom he had robbed of money as well as a wife, and whom he hated according to the extent of those injuries, and the contemptuous toleration with which they had been received. The cowardly spite that filled his little soul was increased by the conviction, to which he had nevertheless trusted for his own safety, that Kate and Mr. Kemper still liked each other well enough, the one to ask, the other to make concession such as had been required. But Mr. Kemper was not to be avoided. A firm hand on Mr. White's shoulder, a sudden weakness in Mr. White's knees, unseemly noises in Mr. White's ears, and he was requested, to favor Mr. Kemper with an hour's interview. Arrived at his office, and the door closed,  17  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7897-00000098"/> 194-      LEFT TO HERSELF. Mr. Kemper said, i"I suppose you know how we stand toward each other--that luck, not honesty, keeps you out of the penitentiary?1" A sullen pause. Then Mr. White replied that he knew how they had stood before Jack Harding left; but Mr. Kemper might not find it so easy now snapping people up and clapping them into a penitentiary. Sam appeared sufficiently exasperated to twist his visitor's neck; but, if he entertained any such design, its execution was post- poned, and he merely said, "I am informed as to Jack Harding's whereabouts, so we will not take issue on that l point; but you are living in a fool's paradise if you think I allowed him to escape without leaving in my possession papers that would convict you, were he a thousand feet under ground. Do you want proof?" 6 No N  "Are you satisfied that I have it?" "Yes. A lawyer knows how to take care of himself." "Very well," said Mr. Kemper. "I shall take such good care of myself as to see that you refund the money drawn from the bank in my name. I shall lose, after all; but I suppose a man can't have anything to do with a scoundrel without losing something by it. During the past week I have been investigating your business matters. I find that. you own your present residence; also the plate, furniture, negroes, carriage, and horses belonging to the establishment. My first thought was to sell these off and indemnify myself fully for the loss sus- tained through you and Harding; but I have determined differently. Here is a deed which I have drawn up, and which you will sign, making over to your wife the afore- said property." "I shall (dt noisfch thing I The house belongs to me, and I can take care of my wife without your advice."   LEFT TO HERSELF.        195 "In the first place, you cannot take care of yourself, as recent events have proved; in the second, I do not offer advice, I give an order, which you disobey at your peril. Here is the deed, I have no time to waste." Slowly and sulkily Mr. White took up the pen, then dashed it back upon the table. "Why don't you haul out papers for a. divorce? That's the next trick, I sup- pose. My wife gets my property, you get my wife, and I may go to the d-l I! Hang it----"But a man cannot articulate clearly with a couple of fingers beneath his cravat, and the rest of Mr. White's sentence was lost. "What do you mean to do?" asked Mr. Kemper, at length releasing his terrified visitor; and, without a word, but, if possible, more slowly and sulkily than before, Mr. White took up the pen and filled the blanks in the papers before him. As he finished, Mr. Kemper said, "Now for my answer to your last speech;" anid, with a vigorous kick, he assisted Nicholas in his exit from the room. Like an infuriated rat he turnled as if worried into giving battle. Like a whipped hound, he luet his master's eye and crept away. Very slowly and sadly the days went by for Florence. She had few visitors. John was depressed and spiritless; her father seemed to shun the house. She had no longer a mother's love to hallow the day, no longer a niother's smile to encourage, a mother's caress to reward her; and as each hour showed more and more drearily the blank which that mother had faithfully and unselfishy filled, how the heart of her child ached for a word from the dear lips that had never before refused their comfort,- for a glance from the kind eyes that had never before withheld'their sympathy  Oh, how h d that face re- mained unmoved with such hot tears rained down upon  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7897-00000099"/> 196       jL"   T'a X U KWH4sEj.; it? How had those folded hands resisted her caresses, pressing coldly on that true heart as if to still the an- swering throb such anguish must awaken? How had those lips been silent and answered not again, when the child's heart seemed bursting with its cry of sorrow, and asked but to bear once more a mother's voice? Very slowly and sadly the days went by. Hitherto her time had beefi consumed in the discharge -of the numberless duties devolving upon one who has the care of an invalid; but now there were no more sick- room delicacies to be prepared, no more prescriptions to be attended to, no more slumbers to be guarded, no physi- cian's face to read, no need to keep the house so quiet, no need to consult her watch so often. All this was over; these duties were done, and their absence only enforced the sense of her loss, for she could not yet bear to assume any in their place. It seemed to her that in so doing she would be breaking the last tie that bound her to the past, renouncing the habits most associated with the memory of her mother, and forming others regardless of her, as if she had really buried her affection and put away the things that belonged to it. Cherishing this unhealthy sentiment, she yielded almost utterly to despondency, the beautiful unselfishness of her nature alone enabling her in. any degree to rise above it, and, when John or her father was at home, to struggle bravely for an appear- ance of cheerfulness. Only Amuy had any idea of the intensity of grief that overwhelmed Florence, and she said to John, "Mas' John, what make you all don't stay at home some, or bring some comp'ny here or somethin'? Dat ar child don't do nothin' but cry from one day's end to another, 'less 'tis you or master's at home; then she pears like she don't want to make you all feel bad; but if things goes on so, you mighty apt to feel bad some *        i   LEFT TO HERSELF.        197 other way, 'cause she's makin' herself sick mighty fast. Every mornin' she takes her ma's Bible, and when she opens it at dem places. mistiss used to read, she can't read a word, and jes shets it up and hugs it up to her breast, and cries like her heart would break. She don't eat nothin' 'less you or master's here, and 'taint no ways right to 'low it. I hope I ain't no wavs persumtuous, Mas' John, but I didn't nuss you all for nothin'." John drew his hand across his brow. "No, Aunt Amy, you were right to tell me. I am glad you did. I ought to have seen it myself." "I warn't no ways blamin' of you, Mas' John; 'cause dar ain't been no heart in de house to do -nothin' since mistiss died." John was silent, and Amy left the room. He sighed heavily, and began his usual restless walk to and fro the chamber. 'He had much to endure. He, too, felt most deeply the death of his aunt, his almost mother. His heart, too, shivered in the chill shadow Death had thrown around the house; his eyes, too, sought wistfully the face that was still so dear. Then conscience was -at work. Whether properly or improperly, he conceived it his duty to remain in the ministry, and did not now, as heretofore, attempt to deceive himself on that point. All the sophisms that love and ambition had presented were scattered like chaff before the wind in the sincere self-examination that he owed to the memory of the dead. He believed in the divinity of Christ; he believed in the necessity of that belief for the winning of salvation; he believed in the importance: of urging, of imploring, men to turn their thoughts from the world to its Creator, from the things of time to those of eternity. He believed himself intellectually and physically strong enough to be a laborer in this field; and. that bv continued effort he 1I*'  V  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7897-00000100"/> -1 y      JLt]' I'm h'U RLF. should gain the moral power required for it. But how- ever plainly duty may be discerned, the performance is not always proportionately easy. John loved a woman who laughed at all this, who mocked at his calling and sneered at his creed ; yet when he reproached her, such flattering words came to her crimson lips, such tender light into her glorious eyes, she made such sweet dis- tinction between him and the profession she derided, that for the moment the disciple forsook his Master; and if he did not deny Him at a woman's bidding, at least he was silent and spoke no word in His defense. But when called upon to fulfill the duties that he could not deter- mine either thoroughly to perform or utterly to renounce, or when alone with memory and conscience to upbraid. him, he was miserable indeed. Judas got his thirty pieces of silver; but John could not recall even a promise of reward. He bad never gained a spoken vow or word of love, and he could not claim the promise conveyed in a smile, the pledge made only by a tone. She worried and perplexed him till he sometimes felt that to be consoled by her were the only heaven he would ask, that to be assured of her affection he could renounce all higher claims, and be content to trust in God's mercy for safety from utter condemnation. Again loftier feel- ings possessed his soul, and he felt that he had debased himself and degraded his manhood in thus offeringr up to a girl's perverted fancy the sacrifice of all his best and holiest purposes, and of all that had been most sacred to his mother, and to her who had taken a mother's place. He sometimes said to himself that Edith was not so unwomanly as to sacrifice love to ambition, she could not love him or she would at least tolerate any profession he had chosen; but the answer had been given by her own lips. -It was not for herself that she could be aLubitious, '   Lizz- 1- CC: JL:-LVLUI S *J  but for one she loved. She must see him do himself justice. She must see men yield him the hoiuage he deserved. She would be proud of him, and for him. The more she loved him, the more ambitious she would be for him. The more intense her affection, the more intol- erable any bar to his progress. All this with looks and tones that said, "I would be ambitious for you; I would be proud for you; I love you;" but only looks and tones could he recall, the words remained unuttered. The be- trayal was to be made before the thirty pieces were secured. Restlessly he pursued his walk; but his was not a selfish nature; and if his face proclaimed a troubled soul, his tongue might truthfully have said that no thought of self was now ruffling his brow or compressing his lips. Ah  how good it is for the soul's repose that we have others to care for besides ourselves I It was long since John's mind had known so healthful a tone (for his reveries had latterly been mere tete-d tetes with Satha- nas); and as he walked to and-fro his chamber, debating within himself the best means by which to relieve his cousin's grief, he was fully compensated for ignoring his own troubles-by the consciousness of being now heartily and wholly in the right. He knew not what to do. It was out of the question to propose a return to the old homestead,-to the place of all others most inseparably associated with the memory of the dead,-even had not Mr. Lockhart already declared his repugnance to the step. Society, he felt, must be distasteful to Florence, though she sweetly and gratefully welcomed the cour- teous kindness shown her by the true-hearted people among whom she had been thrown. He concluded that she must have something, little mat- ter what, to occupy her time, and, if possible, awaken her interest. He went down to the sitting-room, and found ,    '   &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7897-00000101"/> 200      LEFT TO HERSELTF. her alone, a book in her lap; but evidently she was not reading. She had been thinking, with kindred feeling, of what an old lady in Louisiana said to a friend on his way to Virginia, her native State: "Bring me a pillow of the dear old earth, -that it may be placed beneath my head in the coffin." As John entered, Florence smiled, a grave, sweet smile, touching in its tremulous effort to brighten the pale face over which it flickered. it Are you too busy to do somethinag for me, Florence?" The smile died suddenly away, and she bent over her book to hide the tears that rushed to her eyes as she an- swed, "I have very little to do now, John. I have timle for anything you require." "It is not strictly for myself. You remember hearing me speak of Mrs. Jackson's deformed little girl. It seems that when the poor children of the Sunday-school last went to the sewing-room, that they mlight obtain the clothing to be distributed, the unfortunate child was wounded by something she overheard relative to her de- formity, and since that time has never been induced to return, either there or to Sunday-school. This occurred two months ago, and as I have not fallen upon any plan for relief, it struck me that you might enable me to do so. 'rThe child must be fitted before her clothing can be made, the peculiarity of her figure demands it; yet she is liter- ally in rags rather than go to the sewing-room again. Also, it is painful to think that, by refusing to run the gauntlet of school-children's eyes and tongues, she is de- priving herself of almost the only means of enjoyment that she can ever possess. The sports of children, the physical recreations of women, she can never have. Sew- ing will be her work, reading her recreation; that is, if she can now ever learn to read."   LEFT TO HERSELF.        201 "I will teach her myself, John, and fit her clothing, too, poor little thing!" "But she is not an interesting child, Florence. Her deformity is very unpleasing to the eye ;' to me it is of a character excessively repulsive. I cannot endure the sight of her I I cannot bear to have her come near me! She placed her hand over his mouth. "Do not talk so She placed her hand over his mouth. "Do not talk so about the child. It is not kind." "She can never hear of it." "I know; but-I do not mean to lecture, John, but I should hardly like people to say such things of me, even were they said where I could never hear of it. Should you?" "Nor is the girl particularly intelligent. Divest the matter of romance, and you have to deal with a sensitive, self-willed, ignorant child. Shall I send her to you?" "Yes; I will help her, if I can, and the effort will at least do no harm. There would cease to be merit in the performance of any duty if we did only that which was agreeable, it being no particular credit to any of us that we endeavor to please ourselves. But the utterance of such a truism proves that preaching is not my vocation, so I -will not again trespass on your domain." John smiled, grimly. ' The place is to let." "What did you say?" she asked, thinking for an in- stant that she had misunderstood him. "( Nothing." Wistfully she looked up at him, wondering if he still felt as she had once heard him speak, yet fearing to ask, lest the subject might be distasteful and she seem im- pertinent; but he spared her the trouble of decision. While she hesitated he left the room. Florence went, in the afternoon, to take a cross of  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7897-00000102"/> flowers to her mother's grave; and, having remained at the sad spot much longer than she intended, found it necessary to walk very rapidly on her way home. Fright- ened and out of breath, she observed that the street lamps were being lighted, and was endeavoring to accelerate her speed when she heard her name called. With a long- -drawn breath of relief, she stopped and frankly expressed to Mr. Muncair the pleasure afforded by his presence. She had recognized his voice too instantly to be startled, and felt a sense of safety that arose not entirely from the fact of his-being an acquaintance and a gentleman. With an air of kindness, not gallantry, he placed her hand on his arm. "I have been walking behind you for some distance," he said; "but, thinking you might prefer being alone, did not yield to my own wish and join you till your pace evinced alarm; then I thought you would pardon the intrusion. It is much too late for you to be out alone. Will you be more carefull hereafter?" The kind tone of authority seenled very natural, and she answered, much like a child asking pardon, 1 had not an idea that it was so late; I know it was wrong." He looked down at her with a smile of tenderness, but met with no response, for at the moment she was not re- garding him, being occupied with the thought of ler father's uneasiness, when he should reach home and find her still absent; and, as if to justify the feeling, Mr. Lockhart met them as they ascended the steps, having determined to go in search of her. After a few minutes' conversation, Frank was about to leave, when Mr. Lock- bart cordially invited, hinl to take tea with them.' He hesitated, having an engagement with Edward Bertnord to spend the evening at Mr. Shelley's; but Florence was not receiving general visitors, and he might not for months   make a call with so much propriety as at present; be- sides, his engagement was not with Edith; and, though she had some reason to expect him, his absence would be no violation of etiquette except with Edward,-a fact. which rendered the infringement a thing of slight mo- ment. Florence observed his hesitation, mistook its im- port, and said, hastily, "We will not impose our dullness on Mr. Muncair,.father; brighter scenes claim his pres- ence, and he has been sufficiently kind already." "I accept your invitation with pleasure, sir," said Frank to Mr. Lockhart; and, turning to Florence, con- tinued, as her father re-entered the house, "Have you not known me too well to say such a thing? If, as you pro fess to think, I have been kind, you owe me something less ungracious than the words addressed a moment ago to your father." "I was unwilling that he should urge your coming in, when you had, perhaps, something more pleasant in view; and he insisted so much upon it that I feared you would do so from motives of kindness. We are glad to see our friends, but do not solicit charity in any foral." "Proudly spoken, if not justly imagined," said Frank. John came home that evening intending to remain with Florence, but finding Frank, concluded that his own presence might be dispensed with. Accordingly, a few minutes after tea, he went into the hall for his hat. "Where now?" asked Mr. Lockhart. "To. Mr. Shelley's, sir," was John's reply. "Umph!"Adding, as the slam of the front door saluted their ears, "He bad better be up-stairs writing his ser- mons. Not meaning to say anything against the young lady, Mr. Muncair; I am told that I should have to an- swer to you for that; but even if she would have John,  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7897-00000103"/> 204      LEFT TO IBERSELF. she would never suit him as a wife; so what's the use of his wasting every other eveuing in the week?" "Every one must have recreation, father," said Flor- ence. "Oh, there you are I No fault must be found with John. John's sure to be all right. If he says you are to sweep the cobwebs from the sky, off you women run, hunting up broomsticks; and if it is the Pope's toe you are to kiss, down you thump, every soul of you. Isn't that so?" 4"I am not old, and, I hope, not ugly enough yet to charge the stars on that domestic steed; but I should have no objection to kissing the cross on the Pope's slip- per; that, or the emblem of anything else dear and sacred to me.'" "You are more liberal than most members of Prot- estant churches," said Frank. "I am not a member of any church," she replied, " but intend to become one very soon." "Well," said Mr. Lockhart, rising, "I should think long and seriously, and for myself, before takinog such a step; before enlisting in any particular regiment. I am not sure that I don't prefer being an independent ranger. John, or Jim, or Jerry shall not place his yoke of faith on my neck and decree that I wear it, when they all profess to derive their dogmas from the same source,- as well he who proclaims universal salvation, as the proud Vicar of Rome, who declares that he has the keys of heaven and of hell, and holds within the hollow of his puny hand the eternal destinies of man.

Who can persuade a Methodist that the Presbyterian " enjoys religion" when be never shouts? -or who call convince the Baptist that more is required of a candidate for confirmation than that he literally be able to say the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments? Does any Presbyterian believe that the Baptist does not think his sins literally washed away? or an Episcopalian acknowledge that there can be any reason for close communion save that the Baptists don't believe other people to be Christians? Are there any Protestants who believe the most intelligent Catholic when he asserts that he does not worship the canvas and paint that adorn his church, or that he does not buy remission of sins? The different sects seem not only trying to slam the doors of heaven in each other's faces, but some of them absolutely want to send the heathen to perdition!-when, never having known Him, our Saviour Himself says they have still a cloak for their sin." "He was not talking about the heathen," said Flor- ence. Mr. Lbckhart wheeled sharply around: "And where do you find warrant for supposing that He was not talking about the heathen? Is it like Him to send them to one place when they have never had a chance at the other? What's your objection to having the heathen up there?" "Oh," said Florence, hastily, "I don't object to their being up there. I think it perfectly horrible to say they will be lost, and an insult to God." "No Il The paths are filled that. lead to the pool of Erebus, ^and pinchbeck Christians jostle each other in the race to perdition; but for the heathen who 'has 18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7897-00000104"/> 206      LEFT TO HERSELF. obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered him,' there's a free pew in the skies: a good place somewhere, I'll be bound." "If it's a Masonic Lodge, and father finds it out, he will want to be a heathen, and with the heathens stand; red paint upon his forehead, and arrows in his hand. Air -' I want to be an angel,'" said Florence in a low tone to Frank, as Mr. Lockhart plunged vehemently into his overcoat and slapped on his hat. ' I should think," said Frank, "that John would have much ado to persuade you into joining his regiment, when the reverse is so energetically urged by your father." "John does not try to persuade me; nor does father. We all think as we choose arhome. Only father likes us really to think. But you: know people are so different. Now, when I hear a dog crying,/-or see any animal--even a bug-suffering, and cannot relieve it, I pray for it." "Killing is just as good," said Frank. "A great many people would call that trivial, even wrong. And at parties I have prayed for girls to have partners.           1 Frank threw back his head and laughed aloud. "And a great many of the best people in the world would pronounce that absolutely impious; but if those girls felt neglected and mortified, they were suffering just as much as the man who had the withered hand. Only he had his living to make, perhaps, and could not do it, because of his hand." "Well, if those girls were not attractive enough to win partners in the dance, they would probably not be mar- ried; and as that is the means by which a great many expect to make their living, they are on a par with your withered man, after all."   LEFT TO HERSELF.        207 "Now, these very people, the best in the world, as I said, sit deliberately down to meditate on the goodness of God; and-do you know?--that seems to me too hypo- critical for anything, because you know very well that God sees every thought of your heart; and it is like eulogizing some one who you are aware overhears you. So you see different people----" "i I see I shall have to get married and let some good woman keep me strailght," said Frank. It was late that night when Frank went to Edward Bertnord's room. "Who knocks so loud?" asked the latter. "' Tis I, my lord; the renegade." Unlocking the door, Mr. Bertnord admitted his friend, but said he must amuse himself for a short time without disturbing him, and, pointing to a box of cigars on the mantel, resumed his writing. Frank tilted back one chair, propped his feet against another, and quietly com- menced snmoking. "Well," said Mr. Bertnord at last, pushing aside his manuscript, " what's the news to-night? and why were you not on hand to fulfill your engagement?" Frank tossed back his head and slowly blew up a column of smoke, gazed at it till it disappeared, then an- swered, with eyes fixed on the ceiling, "Culpability therefor belongs of right to the Fates, not to me, whom they toss and roll on the billows of life-as though I were a feather or some lighter thing; a woman's whim, for instance." "What's up now between you and the Fates?" "Sir, those ancient females have relentlessly snuffed the candles; they have surreptitiously pinched the wick of joy, and left me, like a miserable what d'you call  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7897-00000105"/> it, stranded high and dry upon the sandy beach of- of---  "Your simile would be more perfect were you to say that those industrious ladies had left you where you are keeping me,-in the dark." Frank went on reflecting': "Women are the queerest pieces of handiwork from an immortal hIand that illume this world of ours. Women are the wind to the weather- cock of men's emotions, and the weather-cock shifts its position the more nimbly as its pivot, the fundamental component of which is selfishness, is oiled by that sleek- est, brightest, and most profusely-perfumed of all material or immaterial mixtures,--flattery. Every sigh of a woman is a mighty breeze to this fickle vane. Vanity watches with a persistence worthy of Argus, and, without doubt, the jealous Juno had in contemplation this very idea when she placed his hundred eyes upon her peacock's tail. What the unseen influence that controls my tongue, and resolves it to say woman, I know not; for I am no longer in love, save with myself,-a weakness with which more than one of the sons and daughters of men can claim blood relationship." Edward yawned and loosened his cravat. "You seem to be talking for your own entertainment, Frank; so don't let me disturb you. I just want to look over the editorial. Should you have anything to say to me, let me know be- fore you begin." For a time Frank silently pursued his reflections; then said, very much in the tone of one thinking aloud, "There are moments of power which sonmetimes come to a man, and he is, in conception, another Atlas, till the Phaeton of an unlucky circumstance drives its scorching chariot in too close proximity, and turns him black (and blue, too) as the dusky, double-sable, sub-equator, mid-desert f   -"AI A A %.X AA ALYA&amp; "."fiA' -vU Ethiop. But it is all in a lifetime. The man who will stay knocked down deserves his fate. My life has been a varied one, and, as variety is- the spice of lite, I have come forth considerably pickled." "How is that?" asked Edward, absently. "I should like to perform a pilgrimage to the tombs of the practicalities in the beautiful land of idealism. In me the practical and theoretical have a nervous horror of affiliation. They are two existences, each removed from the other as divinity from humanity, as reason from instinct, and, though theory and practice illustrate each other, I do not like to drag down the former from its heaven-height to the noisy theatre of the other. German student life is a beautiful ideal which has a physical counterpart. I should like above most things to enter the University of Berlin or Bonn." Edward laid down his newspaper. "Have you been drinking? or are you deranged with less provocation? What has happened to you to-night? Where have you been, and what did you there?" "I have been to see an old sweetheart, and it bhas given me the blues." "You don't say so? Why, I cannot step into an omnibus, or look through the window of a railroad car, without seeing half a score of quondam sweethearts. - ( Wha's her name and where's her hame?'-unless you dinna choose to tell.)" "Her name is Florence, and on  Street her father hath abode." Edward looked grave. Frank continued: "She had been to take flowers to the cemetery, and re- turned so late that I found it my pleasant duty to see her safely home. Once there, I went in, the old gentle- man, my ex-father-in-law, being considerate enough to insist upon it." 18*  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7897-00000106"/> "U D{ L CJw     J V : JU ILlnSlr JL. "The adventure reads as if it had been taken from a six-penny novel. Couldn't you accomplish something original?--unless it were really accident." "Which it was not," said Frank. "If opportunity waits for no man, I return the compliment by not waiting for opportunity. In this instance I made it." Mr. Bertnord knew nothing more than that Frank and Florence had been engaged; whether she had loved him, how Frank had loved her, he did not know, and all he at present cared for was that the breaking of their engage- ment should remain unregretted by Frank. He cordially liked and admired Edith, and hoped to see her, as a wife, correct the faults and restrain the follies that now re- mained unchecked. Hence he regarded with equal pain Frank's reviving interest in Florence, and the unwise violence with which Edith would probably receive any such manifestation. Himself irritated, however, by Frank's nonchalant admission of his intention to renew his friendship with Florence, Edward remarked, "Were I engaged to so superior a woman as Miss Edith, I should hardly care to be relighting old flames. Having throwni aside - " Frank coolly interrupted him, "My dear fellow, let me set you right on one point. Miss Lockhart kicked me as high as the stars. That the throwing aside was a feat not accomplished by your humble servant, he can conscientiously assure you; but, if my lady's heart be still susceptible of flame, I may yet be a millionaire in what poetasters and poetasteressas call the wealth of the affections." "Stop your nonsense, Frank, or you will be sent on another aerial journey. As Miss Edith's friend, I must be too loyal to listen, if you are not too true to her to talk in this strain."   JEU SC - 1 - L/  .. i M/ZIj..zL/.T. A L1L "Miss Edith has too many admirers to break her heart for one." "No doubt. Who said her heart would break? But she is so superb a wqman that I hardly understand how she can have a rival."       , "The fact is I fear she is altogether too superb, and deserves a more brilliant parti than myself. - Did it never strike you, Ned, that even a wild young fellow such as myself would like to have a home? I have a couple of rooms, with a plenty of furniture in them; can come when I please, leave whenever it suits me, go to my dinner if I feel disposed, have it sent to me if I like that better; yet there is a something which all this does not make,-something which so superb a wife might not complete. Is it strange? I want some woman to like me to come home, not merely because it is respectable and a compliment to her. I am so unsociable as to like sometimes to go home, feeling that my house be- longed to me, not to society.; that my wife swept and garnished it for her husband, not for the dear five hun- dred. I am so exacting that I do not care to see my wife flirting with every young man who has nothing better to do? I am so ambitious that I should like to be something more than a lady's treasurer. But who can describe the perfume of the violet? Who shall say what home is? I wonder if there ever existed such a thing as I imagine would be the home of a man and woman loving each other after God's own fashion and letting society go to the deuce?" "And you think Miss Edith would not fulfill your re- quirements?" "I had no particular reference to Miss Edith ;' but since you ask the question point-blank,--I do not think she would."  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7897-00000107"/> "Then," said Edward, rising, "your conduct has been such as we do not expect of gentlemen." On the furious impulse of the moment Frank sprang to his-feet, and, raising the little cane with which he had been idly beating a tattoo on the floor, aimed a blow at his host; the latter, however, caught the cane in his hand as it descended, and, wrenching it from the grasp of his antagonist, said, calmly,-- "Frank, don't make a fool of yourself. Sit down and let us talk over this matter quietly." Frank was advancing to strike Edward again; but the eyes of the latter were fixed upon him so calmly and gravely that, despite himself, he stopped, and his hand fell by his side. "You well know," said Edward, " what a great in- terest I feel in Miss Edith, for her brother's sake even more than her own. Before you returned to New Or- leans, in the fall, I heard of your engagement to Miss Lockhart, and was led to believe it was not dissevered with your consent. You then addressed Miss Edith; but it has always been evident to me that you did not really love her, and could I have prevented it this essay of your power should never have been made; but it is now too late to discuss that. I acknowledge that I be- lieve she loves you. I know that you do not love her. If ever you had any friendship for me, prove it by not carrying this flirtation any further. Wait a moment. You are still angry, and would speak of what I said a few minutes ago. Take till to-morrow morning to think over that, and if then you assert that any honorable nlan would persistently court and finally jilt the woman who loves him, you can have the satisfaction such honor would demand. But I know you, Frank, better than you know yourself, and all I ask of you is that you will !   - .J..1.J L -  -    - tJ LC,oooL .  L2 think. Do not drift hither and thither. Select your course, and strike boldly out. When you have deter- mined upon a step, take it at once. I am much older than yourself and have been your stanch friend too long to be silent now. 'All my life long I have behold with most respect the man Who knew himself, and knew the ways before him; And from amongst them chose considerately, With a clear foresight, not al blindfold courage, And having chosen-with a steadfast mind Pursued his purposes.'" "This matter does not concern you in the least," said Frank, "and I do not choose to submit to your dictation." "I make it my concern because Miss Edith is my friend, and the sister of my friend. I know her'better- much better--than you do, and I know that such a blow to her love and pride would crush every joy of her life. I honestly believe that she would prefer a death of tor- ture to being laughed at or pitied; and even if no one knew of her disappointment, she would imagine the story familiar to all. Heavens, how she would hate you!" "I am not afraid of a woman," said Frank. "When I spoke of that," said Edward, " 1 was rather thinking aloud than addressing you. You would, of course, not be influenced by fear of her, nor should I. You very well know that I cannot be accused of cow- ardice, though I did not return just now the blow you aimed at me." "Had it been any one else who addressed that lan- guage to me, his life would not have been worth a mo- ment's purchase; but if you suppose I meant to jilt your friend, you were wrong. I loved Florence; she discarded me. I do not love Miss Edith; thc lias accepted me.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7897-00000108"/> 214      LEFT TO HERSELF. But I mean to marry her, and would do so whatever my feelings toward Miss Florence. Honor is dearer than love, and I shall not make a woman pay the penalty of my mistake. But to-night I have been led to think of the home I might have had. There is a tenderness, a sacredness, about the place that charms me, and which it is impossible to describe. It is home, that is all. There seems among them a community of feeling, a strength of affection, a contentment with and understanding of each other that delight me. Mr. Shelley comes and goes; the servants give him his dinners and make his fires. Mrs. Shelley talks of Harry, and says boys will be boys,--an assertion which, as there is no disputing, one grows weary of. Charles seems to feel as little at home very often as I do in my room at the hotel, and Miss Edith has no conception of such a feeling as that of placid content. What would she care for a plainly-furnished house with only me in it? I think the burdens of mar- ried life cannot be intolerable if cheerfully divided; but--" "You want somebody mose domestic, I suppose; some- thing in the way of a housekeeper. Why don't you ad- vertise?" Frank rose, yawned violently, stretched himself, and stamped his feet, presenting, of course, a very grace- ful and interesting appearance. Who would not have fallen in love with him? Lazily taking his hat from the chair on which be had thrown it, he pressed it into shape, looked admiringly at it, placed it on his head, gnd finally replied to Edward's last remark,-- "You've hit it exactly. I am afraid Edith will not know when the flour is out or the sugar getting low." "You'll be sick enough of it if she does," said Edward. "Should she ever display any talent in that direction," said Frank, "I'll invite you to tea some night, and you   LEFT7 TO HERSELF.       215 shall hear me play ' Home, sweet home' on the flageolet.

"Come, sir I Is that the way to speak of it?" asked Charlie.  * "Yes, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, Harry; who in the world is it?" said his mother. "Just who do you reckon, now?" At this juncture Eliza put her head in at the door, and, having satisfied herself that Mr. Shelley was absent, said, with a grimace, "Mr. White dun dead, and Mrs. White's a-hollerin'!" "Do you suppose that is true?"Edith asked of her brother. "Yes, it is," said Harry. "He's been away and had a fever, and they got a dispatch just now. John, that lives over there, told me all about it through the fence." "You have not been to see Florence since her mother's death, have you, Edith?" asked Charles. "Yes, certainly. -Aunt and I have called two or three times." ' "' Called I'" he indignantly repeated. "Do you sup-  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7897-00000109"/> 216       LEF'T TOe HE^RtSE1F. pose she would have 'called two or three times' had your positions been reversed?" "Really, I am not prepared to answer for what any one else would do. Les biensdances required that I should call. I did so. If her code demanded anything more, I presume she would be guided by it." k "Well, I can assure you, Edith, that her code would exact much more-companionship for the lonely, kind- ness for the sorrowful, attention for the stranger. Go with me to see her after tea, won't you?" "I expect visitors, Charlie; besides, I do not know what to talk to her about. She would not care to hear of balls, or parties, or novels, or fashions, or any of my friends; and I amn sure I do not care to discuss church matters or parish regulations." "Nor would she. However, ' Ephraim is joined to his idols, let him alone.' If your own feelings do not prompt you to go, you may as well remain at home." "My feelings prompt me to the selection of entertain- ing and agreeable society, and the companionship of those to whom I can render myself entertaining and a   agreeable. Consequently my happiness does not consist in visiting at my uncle's." Charles silently commenced the perusal of the evening pape'r. Edith rarely addressed him in this tone, but he knew what it indicated, and felt no desire to increase the irritation that evidently already existed. He was grieved, too, by the moral defects which were every day becomini more apparent. As life became to him more earnest and more real ; as he began to recognize, the fact that " dust thou art, to dust returtiest, was not spoken of the soul ;" as he felt the growth of a desire to be something more than a successful lawyer, or a prosperous merchant,-he' turned in vain to his sister for sympathy and encour-   "UEFT" TU HEKSELEF.      21'i agement in the aspirations which had found their way into his heart for a nobler and fuller life. True, he had never asked for sympathy nor alluded to his feelings; but had her affections been well trained, her nature worthily developed, she would not have required that he should. Had her faculties ever been exalted above the petty requirements of a mere schoolmistress, she could have comprehended what now she only saw. As it was, she mistook her brother's thoughtfulness for indifference, his sadness for sourness, and regarded as the result of ill temper that weariness of their feverish life which often overpowered him.  Charles was still beyond measure proud of his beautiful sister, but lie longed for the quiet of home, and the ingleside was not her sphere. He still gloried in her accomplishments, and delighted in her vivacity; but these things become irksome when one can look for nothing more. He was still charmed to see her the belle and queen of fashionable life, but he began to feel that on the threshold of home she laid down her sceptre and was crownless. He loved her with all the chivalrous tenderness of his noble nature; and if she did not prove the sister he had dreamed of, he still did not willingly discover her faults or consciously analyze her defects. Only, as these facts began to dawn upon his mind, he thrust them aside, making companionship with books and his own thoughts, or seeking the society of his cousin, who, though social, had never made of her father's house a mere reception-room; and who never so overtaxed her powers of entertainment that at home she gave herself up to lassitude and peevishness. Ah! had Edith's gifts but been sustained and cherished, how dif- ferent had been her influence as a sister I A noble vine had been'consigned to careless hands and left to grovel with the rankest weeds.

"Nothing but leaves, no garnered sheaves Of life's fair ripened grain; Words, idle words for earnest deeds, We sow our seeds, lo! tares and weeds We reap with toil and pain :- Nothing but leaves." As she had said, Edith expected visitors, and they came. Why was she disappointed? As the door-bell sounded, she became more animated, appeared more en- grossed in conversation, and resolutely avoided a glance toward each newcomer till he stood before her. Where- fore the disappointment with which she recognized Mr. Dav or Mr. James? Had Frank grown careless of a welcome at her hands? At least he had not been so often to receive it since the night of her triumph on their mimic stage. Why?  To answer was the puzzling task witl which she vexed her brain. "Mr. White is dead.  Had you heard of it?" she asked Mr. Kemper, as they sat apart from the others. "What White? Not--:" "Yes. Nicholas." "Indeed?" he said, gravely. "I had not heard of it. What was the occasion of his death?" 'Typhoid fever. He died in Vicksburg. Aunt Laura is at lMrs. White's now, and sent me word a few mo- ments ago that our intelligence was correct. We bad already heard that he was dea 1." Both were silent, being occutp'd with a vivid remem-  .   LEFT TO HERSELF.        219 brance of the scenes in which Mr. White had borne so prominent a part. Looking up, he caught her-eye, which was, however, immediately averted, with a tacit apology for the scrutiny with which it had rested on his face. He disposed of the subject by asking what she meant to do with Labenstein, who at the moment was making his entrance, adding, sotto voce, as the unconscious object of remark approached, "I really believe the fellow thinks you are going to marry him." "If he does-" she replied, in the same tone, "he imagines that I place undue value on a ' Frenchman out of France ;' but I am not sure the fault is all his own. Ah, Count, I am in despair! How shall I thank you for these exquisite flowers?" On the next evening disappointment still awaited her. She had declined going out, confidently hoping to see Frank at home; but John Lockhart was her only visitor. Expecting every moment Frank's step in the hall, and. thinking to arouse his jealousy, at any rate to make plain' -: her indifference to the disapprobation with which shAie knew he regarded her flirtation with Mr. Lockhart, she conducted herself toward the latter with a degree of graceful encouragement that might- have alarmed a truer lover than Frank, or emboldened a more modest suitor than John. This pastime, however, lost interest as time sped and the hour grew too late for additional visitors. John's ardor became troublesome, and she would fain have withdrawn her treacherous smiles; but what--with intent to precipitate the claircissement of a declaration ---had been a grand strategic movement was now but an error, hastening the same undesirable denouement. In spite of her retreat, the decisive moment had arrived. John be'sought and demanded that she should tell him truly whether she would ever be his wife. With the  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7897-00000111"/> 220      LEFT TO HERSELF. willful persistence of one who knew not what she did, she bade him choose between herself and his profession. He exclaimed, bitterly, "Oh, Edith! Is this woman's love? Can you make no sacrifice for my sake?^ "I have not said I loved you; I must first know how much you love me. Is this man's devotion? Can you make no sacrifice for mine?" "But what would you sacrifice, my own Edith? Some pride, perhaps some comfort, for a clergyman is seldom a rich mlan; but for that, if indeed you love me, can you still withhold this dear hand? And what would you have me yield? You do not regard it so; but to me, dear Edith, it is conscience, honor, truth. Could you still respect me? Could I respect myself? You will not require it?" An hour's conversation produced nothing more satis- factory to either party, and it had grown so late that he must, perforce, leave. With a heavy-heart he rose and said, sadly,-  "You do not love me, Edith." She extended her hand: "i Good-night." Calmly, but not boldly, she sustained the reproachful look of those earnest eyeqi'that seemed to ask if she would permit him to leave her thus; calmly and gently, but with unconquerable resolve, with cold, immovable determination. He saw it as he stood, her hand within his own, her -eyes, upturned to his; and, had she loved him, she might halre feared the changes marked by those gray eyes and firm, proud lips. The spirit of resistance was at length aroused within him also, and she might have read its workings in his face. "This girl does not love me. I doubt whether she even fancies that she does. Shall she shame my man- hojo.' by robbing itof the truth and dignity which alone   LEFT TO HERSELF.       221 perfect and adorn it? At any rate, she does not love me well enough to marry me as I am. How can I tell that I should suit her better were I to sacrifice my wishes to her-own-yield my judgment to a woman's whim, and forget the man I am, that, in another guise, she, for- sooth, may smile upon me?" He had turned to go. She did not love him, but in qome natures vanity is more powerful than love, and will stoop very far to con- quer. "John!" He came back. Oh, John, beware! beware!"Trust her not I She is fooling thee!" Hle took her hand, and held it silently for a moment. It was so fair and beautiful,-its one ornament, a very queen of diamonds, glittering like a dewdrop on a lily. Everything around her was so beautiful and harmonious and refined, and he so loved refinement and beauty and harmony. Then the temptation assailed him; he would seem to yield ; his wife would forgive him soon, or if not soon, knowing that she was his, that only God could take her fr8m him, he could afford to wait. Yes-yes? -No I "O Lamb of God, Eve me strength I A thou- sand times, nol"Almost roughly, he threw aside her hand, and muttered, as he rose from his seat, "That anything so fair should beckon to perdition!" He leaned his head on his hand, his elbow resting on the mantelpiece, and stood gazing atcher earnestly, al. most fiercely; his pale face and quivering nostrils denot- ing the conflict going on within him. Presently he said, "Grant that I defy God, deny truth, scorn the example of my sainted mother, and trample under foot the desire of her life,-what then?" She gave him a glance which drew him again to her 19*  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7897-00000112"/> 222      LEFT TO HERSELF. side. He repeated his question, but she was silent, though his arm encircled her waist, and she permitted him to kiss her brow, her cheek, even her soft, warm lips. "Edith," he asked, his voice hoarse with contending emotions, "Edith, will you take me as I am or demand this debasing sacrifice? Will you, indeed, require this thing of me, or is it but a poor test of love,-unworthy you or myself? Answer me truly." "It is a test of your love, but not merely such, for I am deeplye a earnest. Do you not love me well enough -to resign your surplice and take only me?" "I do lot I By the memory of .my mother,-no A life so pure as hers was never lived' in:vi^n,?, He stumbled over a chair in the hall, and the police- man at the corner thought his unsteady walk the admiss- ible post-prandial gait. Not so. He was only blind with tears. The next evening after tea, Florence went into the sitting-room, and was surprised at finding John lying on the lounge. "Why," she said, "I did not know you-had come. Have you had tea?" "I do not want any; my head aches intolerably." "-I am so sorry. Let me bathe it for you with cologne or cold water, and turn down this gas that is staring you out of countenance. Then you will feel better." "Thank you. Ah I that is pleasant." After a pause, so lengthened that she hoped he had fallen asleep, he said, languidly, "Mrs. Jackson already discovers or fancies an improvement in her little girl, Florence, and is verly grateful for the care you have be- stowed upon her." "Where did you see her?"   LEFT TO HERSELF.       223 "At home. I have been visiting some poor people to- day whom I had neglected for some time." She said nothing, but he understood the tenderness with which her hand lingered on his brow. His eyes still closed, and his tone languid, he nevertheless smiled faintly as he continued: "There was on the table a little basket of eggs, which I promised to bring you; but Mrs. Jackson and her old hen cackled so much alike, that I concluded they were disputing as to which had the best right to send them, and thought it well to leave the property till the ownership should ibe decided. Mrs. Jackson and her seven children, and the old hen! I am a strong man, but it broke me down,-that visit." "I am not surprised. Where else have you been?" "Oh, I don't know.

I am not happy. I do not expect to be. Very dear hopes are crushed by this resolve, very happy visions blotted out; but to-day I have felt strong. God help me when the moments come which I have known, and shall know again; when I suffer and grow faint, and long to look again into her bonnie eyes, and would dream again my love dream, no matter at what cost. - Ah I to give it all up everything that was dear to me!

At the moment, she would willingly have seen him marry her cousin, trusting to avert by prayer the result which she was convinced would be fatal to his peace of mind. She little knew what Edith would have exacted, and her thought was, any risk, anything but absolute sin, rather than see him suffer. "Why need you give her up, John,--if she loves you?" "Ay! if she loved me; but she does not. You might tremble for my resolution if I thought she loved me. May God accept my sacrifice, such as it is, imperfect at the best. Yes, if she loved me! Let us say no more about it. Only pray for me." For the second time Edith broke an engatgement, and remained at home, expecting a visit frolm Frank. During the evening Edward Bertnord made his appearance, and found her enduring the infliction of Mr. Hale's and Mr. Day's society. Never doubtinga that Frank would come to-night, she was anxious to be relieved of the presence of the two latter, and had taken the liberty of div iing her attention between their conversation and her crochet-needle; pausing with an appearance of in- terest only when Mr. Day told of his having been com- missioned to ask that she would take part in the theatri- cals to be got up for the benefit of some poor families, sufferers by a recent fire. "I will, indeed," said Edith, " with pleasure." "You do not understand Mr. Day, Miss Edithh. The exhibitions are to be public," said Edward. "So I inferred from what Mr. Day said." "Had vou not better consult your father or your brother before you give a definite answer?" s+   "I do not see the necessity for it."   LEFT TO HERSELF.       225 "We may, then, count on you, Miss Edith?" said Mr Day. Remembering the applause she had won before, and eager to hear again the voice of admiration, she answered that he might. Edward was vexed, and ventured on another remon- strance. "I really would not commit myself just now, Miss Edith. Wait till you have investigated----" "I have perfect confidence in Mr. Day. He would not suggest anything improper." "You cannot think more highly of Mr. Day than I do, Miss Edith, and he advised at the outset that you should not give an immediate answer." "Thanks to both, then, for your consideration. My reply shall be postponed." This being decided, her thoughts reverted to Frank, and she resumed her crochet-needle. ' Well, gentlemen," said Edward, " we may congratu- late ourselves on being promoters of industry. Let us report to the nearest 'society for the encouragement of home manufactures;' or perhaps some benevolent asso- ciation will employ us to visit here twice a week, in which event Miss Edith will soon have completed a barrel of these things, and we can have a charity sale. What say you?" "Agreed," replied Mr. Day, rising; "and as the sub- ject is highly important, I shall give it my immediate attention. Mr. Hale, will you be one of the committee?"' As the door closed upon them, Mr. Bertnord ensconced- himself in an easy-chair, and inquired of Edith where she had been that afternoon. "Driving." "You seem fatigued."  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7897-00000114"/> 226       LEFT TO HERSELF. "I am," was the laconic reply. "You are not tired; you are vexed." "True." "What about-?" "Everything-inghing." And she resumed her fancy- work. "By which I understand that you mean me to enter. tain myself. Where are the cards?" "I do not wish to play cards." "Do you remember the old song?-' Nobody axed you, sir, she said.' Let me see. Ah! here they are." Re- seating himself, and drawing a small table toward him, he commenced his game of solitaire. At length the needle moved less swiftly; the work lay motionless on her lap; and resting her cheek on her hand, she became unmindful of Edward's presence. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick, and jealousy is cruel as the grave. Frank had never before neglected her so long; he was neither sick nor absent. Had he grown indifferent, or was there a dearer one than she might now claim to be? Long ago, and often, though with Frank ever at her side, she had tormented herself with doubts of his de- votion, but could recall no satisfying reason for the sentiment, and now condemned the folly that had sought for pain when only pleasure was proffered to her lips. Her defiant mood had exhausted itself, and to-night she was simply unhappy. Occasionally looking up from his game, Edward noted the sadness gradually stealing over her features, and redaiily divined the origin of her pain; but knowing her indomitable pride, he knew, also, the haughty scorn with which sympathy or advice would be repelled, and dared d  not offer either.   "EFIT TO HERSELF.       227 However, throwing aside the cards, he at length asked, "What is the matter, madam? Idf the name of all hu- manity less favored than yourself,-some in rags, and some in jags, and some in velvet gowns,-I ask and de- mand to know what right you have to be sad!" She half'smiled, and answered, slowly, "Away off in the distance is a building. I think it must be a barn. I have been looking at it all day. I think it has been looking back at me,--staring blankly back at me from away off in the distance,-looking dully back at me, with the one eye in its forehead. I never was in a 'barn in my life. I think I would give my diamonds to go somle- where and live awhile by myself in a barn with a great square window and nothing but some hay and straw and a few rats,-the rats to be of a retiring disposition, other- wise I should prefer a middle-atged- spider of cheerful countenance and steady habits." "Like Japhet, now^ I am in search of farther informa- tion," said Edward I Atgain I ask, what is the matter?" "Do you nevr," said Edith, " suffer fronm these revul- sions of feeling? Last week Charlie and I rode out together, and while he stopped to talk with the overseer whom we met on his way to the city, I rode on. Seeing some very beautiful wild flowers, I undertook to get them. I gathered the flowers, and then commenced the fun, for I found it impossible to recover my seat in the saddle. The horse was very spirited, and would not bear the slightest touch of the whip; but, in trying to mount, I drew it across his face and cut him in the eye. How he did toss his head, and kick, and circle around me, giving an idea of centrifugal force which my studies in natural philosophy had failed to convey I I laughed until almost powerless to do anything but follow him as he backed among the tall weeds. I then talked to him; I stroked  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7897-00000115"/> 228      LEFT TO BERSELF. his face; I patted his neck, and was almost in the saddle when I heard a crash as if some one had taken a step or two and stopped. With one foot in the stirrup and a hand on the pommel, I glanced down to see if I looked very funny. My habit just touched the ground. I looked so tall and slim, I burst into a laugh; the horse gave a spring, and I again alighted, safely, I am happy to say; whether gracefully, we will not inquire. I shall never laugh so again, I am sure. Everything laughed. The tall, dead grass woke to life, and tossed about in an ecstasy of laughter. The old oaks murmured among themselves, and laughed indulgently. The bells of the wild flowers chimed musical laughter, and the sun smiled quizzically on us all. I was in hopes I had heard the footsteps of some handsome youth, who would say, 'Beautiful stranger I ivhence com'st thou?' Ah! what a fine thing it must be to have any one say' Beautiful stranger i whence com'st thou?' However, he never emerged from the blackberry-bushes; so I accepted the hospitality of a neighboring stump, determined to wait for Charlie. I had hardly seated myself, when lo I one of those revul- sions we were speaking of. I became quiet, almost melancholy; had over-laughed myself, you see, and now heard the sanle noise without the slightest curiosity or alarm. If a snake had appeared, and, with a polite bow, remarked that it was a pleasant evening, I should have said 'yes' with as little astonishment as if acquainted with snake etiquette and reciprocating an ordinary com- pliment.

Indeed, every woman, to be happy, should be a Christian. It is her nature to worship something, and she invariably does it. It is her nature to cling to something, and humanity sometimes fails her. She cannot be content with nature's revelations, and will faint beneath the chimeras of her own brain. For happiness here, if not hereafter, let every woman seek to be a Christian. "For the perfection of her nature and for the purity of char- acter that she cannot otherwise attain, he would have added had he uttered his entire sentiment. "I am neither Christian nor Infidel," she replied. "I have never thought seriously on either side of the ques- tion. A long time ago, one vacation, my aunt (Mrs. Thornton) said of some infidel work father was reading, that it should be tossed into the fire, and not left about the house for me to get hold of. This made him very angry, and he said that if I had to-- listen to religious cant I should have also- the, other side of the question, and im- mediately placed the book in my hands. When I re- turned to school I thought it very fine, and an evidence of my superior intellect, to shock the girls with the senti- ments gleaned from it. I should soon, however, have forgotten all about it, had not the girls told the principal, and the principal made me repeat the Nicene Creed before the whole school every day for a month I * You cannot tell how that incensed and mortified me, and I revenged myself by reading and disseminating everything of a pro- hibited character that I could lay my hands on. One morning Mr. Nathan was opening school with the usual chapter i and, when he read a particular verse, I whis- pered to the girl next me, ' That is not true. I will tell 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7897-00000116"/> you about it when we go in the other room.' He tucked' in his chin, and shot a glance at me over his spectacles.

"I wrote to father," she said, " and three days after he entered the schoolroom just as recitation had com- menced. He turned to me, ' Is that the man whb struck you?'  Yes, sir.' The room was as still as death. You might have heard a sunbeam run across the floor. Every eye was fixed on father. He walked up to Mr. Nathan: 'I have come to see that you make a humble apology to this young lady for your insolence.' 'My conscience is my prop and my support, Mr. Shelley, and though you insult my honor, even-ay--even though you sue me at the law  ' Father interrupted him, ' You are one of the dogs who yelp for mint-salve and bank- note bandages. Gentlemen know a quicker cure for wounded honor 1' At sight of the revolver I thought my worthy tutor would have fainted, while I could hardly refrain from dancing with delight. If hi s boasted prop did not fail him, his knees and his courage did, for down he went. Oh, how could he do itl 'Call the police, somebody!

Get your bonnet, Edith.' And, while I was absent, he gave Mr. Nathan a splendid horsewhipping. As we drove off, he described it to me, and then I made him angry a second time, for I involuntarily exclaimed, 'Oh, father, why didn't you do it while I was there? Did not the girls enjoy it greatly?" "What did he say?" asked Edward. "He said he did not know, indeed; that they were not very girlish or very ladylike if they did. After that encour- aging observation I was prudently silent. However, you see my experience has not been favorable. I have learned bv heart a whole lesson in rhetoric while that old man kept us on our knees; yet he boxed my ears with his holy book, and abjured its doctrine, sooner than have his soul go where glory waits it, as he professes Co believe it will.

"Why familiarize yourself with thoughts of jealousy, revenge, murder, what not? Why encourage evil passions, and cherish the growth of un- womanly violence?   Upon my word, Miss Edith, it grieves me.

You had better be learning to make buckwheat cakes and darn your husband's socks." "Thank you. Those sweets of domestic life are not to my taste. I hope Mr. Smith will not deem it neces- sary for me to provide them." Edward ventured to say, with affected carelessness,- "I think Muncair would take to home-life,-is, in fact, a more domestic fellow naturally than one would suppose." Her face flushed, and she was silent; resuming her fancy-work. Edward scribbled in his note-book a few moments, then tore out the leaf and handed it to Edith, telling her that he had composed her requiem, but she must not think so highly of it, or so far betray her Irish descent, as to kill herself that she might hear it sung. She took it lan- guidly and read it listlessly. It ran thus:- "Alas for the early dead! Alas for the youthful head That hath gone to rest, That earth hath prest, Ere the summer of life had- come! "Dreamless lie in thy narrow bed; Death's great mystery thou hast read, Lone and cold, While the leaves, grown old, Fall sighing round thy tomb!   LEFT TO HERSELF.            233 "Death woo'd thee while the morning-glory, Pure and frail, yet told the story Of a young life bright, but fleeting, And, fading, whispered of the meeting Of his bride with Azrael. Thy spectre bridegroom's icy kiss, Mouldered on thy lips-for this The chimes mourned in a knell! "Swift hath sped the fatal dart, Swift grown chill thy feverish heart. Oh, direful knell!

Wail-wail her requiem, mournful bell! Miserere! miserere! Bright, sweet flower, farewell! farewell!" "Sublime!"  said Edith.   "Reading  it, Milton  and Mother Goose would die again-of envy." "Now  this," said Edward, "over here, on the next page, is what I should like to write for you. I will read it myself this time : f{ Oh, mourn not for the quiet dead!

Oh, weep not, then, but sing, Grave! the victory is hers! Death! thou hast no sting!" "Ting-a-ling " chimed in Edith, and frowned impa. tiently. Edward was vexed and grieved.     He would have given anything for the privilege of telling Edith that Frank did not love her, and bidding her discard him, for his sake-for her own; but this he dared not do; so he sketched trees, drew faces, and printed names half through his little book; ending by throwing in her lap some dog- gerel verses, and making a hasty exit. He was deter- mined to give her warning of some kind-let her take it in jest or earnest; but preferred not to witness the imme- diate effect. The paper lay in her lap, and would per- haps never have been read, but for a ring at the door- bell. The hope flamed up in her aching heart that even at that late hour Frank had come; and the desire of her proud soul to seem preoccupied when her tardy lover should enter, induced her to glance over the verses Ed- ward had left. He would, indeed, like the bravest of his sex, have fled fast and far had he foreseen that the effect of his rhyme would be-tears I "You are pretty blue to-night, Edith dear!

But I'm telling what I know- Man was fickle from the go, And the world is full of woe, Edith dear, Edith dear, And I fear you'll find it so, Edith dear!" When Mr. Bertnord returned to his room, he found it already occupied by Mr. Muncair. "Where have you been?" inquired the latter.  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7897-00000119"/>  "To see Miss Edith." "How is she?" "Very well." "I have not seen her for some time." "No?" "Did she mention it?" "No." "Did she inquire after me?" "No." "You are trying that syllable on all the notes of the gamut. Suppose you vary it." "I cannot, unless you vary the nature of your inquiries, for, really, Miss Edith neither spoke nor thought of you, so far as I know. At any rate, your absence has not banished her smiles nor impaired her beauty." "I never thought Miss Edith beautiful," said Frank, with affected indifference. "No flirt can be perfectly beautiful, because none of her class can have soul, and without soul there cannot be exceeding beauty. A co- quette is a flower without fragrance. Doesn't the japonica belong exclusively to high life? So does your fine lady, with her absence of soul." "Muncair, if you don't love the girl, why in the name of common sense don't you break up the affair and be done with it?" "Because I intend to marry her, and that right soon. I must put on the scotch matrimonial, or go down hill faster than is expedient. In other words, I can't resist making love to my old sweetheart, and must place myself beyond the reach of temptation, all my vows being due in another direction. Is that satisfactory?" "Pre-eminently, of course," said Edward, sarcastically; "and some day you'll be ready to shoot me for having been asked the question."   LEFT TO HERSELF.       237 "Very likely,"7 said Frank, carelessly. "Seriously, Frank, if you intend to marry her, I do not understand how you can speak disparagingly of her. I am surprised and mortified by the course you have pur- sued toward Miss Edith. It is unworthy of you. I am disappointed in you. It is neither chivalrous nor high- toned, and is, therefore, unlike yourself. Such vacillation is absolutely boyish. If you love Miss Lockhart, it were worse than folly to marry Miss Edith; but, if your fancy for her be mere fancy, if all you desire be a piquant episode before marriage with .the woman you would choose from all the world, and before all the world, as your companion,-your friend,-your wife,-why, all- I have to say is that your whistle may be a very pretty plaything, but you are paying dearly for it. In parading her faults before the eyes of another man, no matter how true a friend " "Pshaw!"Frank exclaimed. "Don't I know you don't believe half I have said of her; and " "No. You know nothing of the kind." "And didn't I know you were going to defend her?" "Whether you knew that or not, there is something else you should begin to understand," said Edward. "To wit, viz.?" "That it is not my place, and should not be my privi- lege, to defend her." Frank yawned, and took a side view of his foot; yawned again, and gave vent to imprecations on Chenou for making boots that ran down atthe heel. What the connection between this and the subject in hand he did not state; but there must have existed a charm in it as beneficial as mysterious, for he presently said,-- "Yon are right, grandfather; and, if I never do so any more, I'll never do so again. Ned, you are a man, and  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7897-00000120"/> 238      LEFT TO HERSELF. I honor you. You are a gentleman, and I admire you. But enough of women. Ring for a dozen fried." "You will generally find that number 'in a stew.'" CHAPTER    XXI. TRuF r. times had Mrs. White fallen all limp and life- less on the parlor sofa. Three times had she been leftfto revive sans sal volatile. Three times had she-of her own accord reopened her eyes upon this wicked world. She looked at Kate, and asked if it could be possible. Kate looked into the fire, and seemed to think it could. She stared at her daughter, and demanded to know what would happen next. Kate gazed into the fire, and de- clined the hazard of an opinion. "Kate, you have never known trial; how will you bear up under this?" "I have known greater trials than this, mother." No, that vou haven't. Why, what is left won't keep us in hair-pins. Only the establishment and four hun- dred a year 1 Dear me I If Nicholas had only let us k,ow something about his affairs I We need not have had such an expensive funer--we need not have-ex- pended the little money that was left for us. But it was just like him; he never would'listen to me." "Mother, I beg of .you--- " "We'll both have to beg soon, fropm present appear- ances. If I had known this was to be the upshot---" "Mother, Mr, White's property wea his own. not ours. It shocks me to hear you speak in this manner of the dead. Try to be calm, I beseech you!" ,ii   LEFT TO HERSELF.        239 Even Mrs. White was slightly abashed, and relapsed into silence, -only rousing herself to ask Kate if she did not think they had better send for Mr. Manning, thB trustee. Kate said she did not think it necessary, but her mother could act as she thought proper. Mrs. White thought proper to request an interview, and penned a note to that end. Mr. Manning called as desired, and for the second time related everything that had come within his knowl- edge concerning Mr. White and his affairs. In the course of conversation he mentioned Mr. Kemper as the lawyer who had drawn up the deeds. Thereafter Mrs. White asked but few questions, and, to Kate's great relief, was throughout the-day absorbed in her own reflections. On the following morning Mrs. White wrote another note, requesting another interview; and' in the after- noon Mr. Kemper's shadow was thrown across her door- way. No need that the servant should direct him toward the parlor. This hall, these rooms,-had be forgotten them? As Mrs. White applied her eye to the crevice between the folding-doors, she was dissatisfied withi the expres- sion of Mr. Kemper's countenance. A shade of sadness rested on it; but predominant was the bitter smile with which he noted the changes wealth had wrought in the  apartment, and thought upon the sacrifices that had been made to secure them. There remained too little to re- mind him of the past, and Mrs. White hastened to atone for the deficiency by presenting a feature new to the scene, if one not calculated to revive pleasant thoughts. She entered, with a deeply-bordered handkerchief and a prolonged sigh, seated herself, and despairingly pressed  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7897-00000121"/> - 4U      IlffD ' I'U TU KQJL i. the cambric to her eyes. Mr. Kemper, having resumed his seat also, a lengthened pause ensued. Either she was overpowered by emotion, or desirous of forcing her visitor to define his position by the char- acter of his opening address. Were the latter her object, she failed most signally, being outgeneraled by the "masterly inactivity" with which he opposed her. Find- ing the silence likely to remain unbroken, she com- menced: "I have sent for you, Mr. Kemper, as one who knew Nicholas well."   w- If this was thrown out as a "feeler," she still failed, for the enemy did not open fire, and she was still un- assured of his position. He acknowledged by a bow the correctness of her statement relative to Nicholas, and was silent. She resumed: "Yesterday morning I accidentally learned that you were my poor dear nephew's lawyer and confidential ad- viser, and I thought perhaps you could give me some particulars concerning him. Anything would be precious to me; the slightest thing; what he said; what his plans were; how he felt when you saw him last." Under present circumstances, Mr. Kemper would have felt puzzled to describe his last interview with Mr. White, or the probable emotions of that gentleman, on the occa- sion referred to. Mrs. White went on: "You will pardon my presumption. I would not have dared send for you, but Kate said to me, 'Mother, if it will be any comfort to you, send for him. Mr. Kemper is all that is good and kind; you will receive nothing but gentle treatment at his hands.' I always thought you did not like me; but I never knew, until after the occurrence of that deplorable affair in which. Nicholas was involved," and Mrs. White mewed pite- ' 91   ously behind the handkerchief, " how much reason you seemed to have for your dislike. When we heard of that dreadful affair, I sank beneath the blow. Poverty we could have borne, as we shall have to bear it now,- miy poor Kate, too, so unused to rough contact with the world,-but to be disgraced I Kate bade me be of good cheer, all would yet be well. 'Ah, my clhild,' said I, 'you little know this world.' 'I may not know the world, but Mr. Kemper I do know.' ' You knew him once,' I said, 'when he was as poor as we -are now, but--' She interrupted m e, and said, ' Having known him once, I know him always. Wealth could never change him ;' but I would not believe it, and yielded to despair. Then my angel child tried to comfort me, and told me how truly she had loved you up to the moment of her marriage; and that she believed you would now be kind to us, if only to atone for the neglect that had wounded her into discarding you." The handkerchief shook be- fore her face through every fibre of its black border. d"You will think it strange-perhaps indelicate, my speak- ing thus, but grief confers strange privileges, and your approaching marriage with Miss Lockhart still further tends to rob my words of all indelicacy. In that sorrow- ful moment of confidence, I saw the error (oh, do not call it sin, for I believed I was acting for the best 1) that I had committed in urging Kate to marry my nephew. Never since that moment has Kate alluded to the sub- ject, and I would not for the world have her know that I had mentioned it to you. But, ah, never since then has my heart ceased to ache!-and if a life-long devotion to my child be any reparation, it shall be made. If you can forgive me, I shall have one pang less to endure. If you,cannot, I do not blame you, but it will be a comfort -to me to know that I have done all a woman andsa mer- 21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7897-00000122"/> 242       LEFT TO HERSELF. ber of the church can. I have humbled myself to ask forgiveness." "I forgive you, Mrs. White, assuredly. I am sorry that I have so little to communicate regarding your nephew. If I can be of service to you it will give me pleasure. In a few weeks I propose leaving New Orleans for some quiet watering-place; meantime, if you need assistance in the arrangement of your affairs, I shall be glad to render it."  "Thank you, oh, thank you, for your great kindness I We should, indeed, value the assistance of one who would be a friend as well as a lawyer. As soon as Kate is well enough to enter upon business matters "Is your daughter ill, madam?" "Oh, no, not ill; but ndthing interests her. She seems to be sick of city sights and city sounds and city people. She needs partial retirement and more exercise." "Why do you not take her to the country?" "We cannot leave New Orleans for some weeks yet; and even then I hardly know where to go, Kate dislikes the country so much." "Why, then, not go to some place of summer resort, sufficiently retired, but affording pleasant society?" "That would, indeed, be beneficial; but we have no escort now, no gentleman to direct the porters and settle hotel bills, and do all those things that a lady shrinks from. Otherwise, I should not hesitate for a moment." "Where would 'you wish to go? Have you a prefer- ence for any particular locality?" be asked. "None in the world. But why discuss the matter? We cannot go." "I was about to say that I would, with pleasure, take charge of you both if " "Oh, Mr. Kemper! such a thing had never occurred   LEFT TO HERSELF.        243 to me. I had not thought of it for one moment. You are too good. We cannot impose upon your kindness to such an extent." Then, fearing that his silence implied retraction of the offer, she continued: "At least, nothing but my child's health could influence me to do so. If she does not improve, my love for her will outweigh all other feelings, and I will avail myself of your great kindness. In any event, I hope we shall not trouble you much; we will go to whatever place you may select, and after you have got us rooms, we will lay no claim to your atten- tion. Your time will be fully occupied, as doubtless you will select the place your lady-love prefers, and we shall not interfere with you." "I shall not neglect the charge with which I am to be honored. I had thought of going to Monterne in about four weeks, and if the arrangement be agreeable to you and your daughter, I shall take much pleasure in securing accommodations for you." "Oh, you are so kind! It is the place of all others I She will be a new creature. Conscience and duty-bid me go. Ah I how little I thought how this interview would end!" she added, as he rose to leave. "I sent to you, hoping to quiet my heart by making what atone- ment I could for a grievous error; and how have you, by your kindness, heaped coals of fire on my head I I sen* for you, hoping to hear something of the dear departed; and though you can tell me nothing of him, you help me to save the very life of, one who is dearer than he was." There was a curious smile upon Mr. Kemper's face as he walked down to his office. Mrs. White marveled at the facility with which he had yielded to her guidance. She had expected to have her ingenuity taxed to the utmost. As it was, she had  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7897-00000123"/> hardly directed her finger toward the path ere he had bounded to the desired point; her Alpha had hardly cleft the air before her ears were greeted by the Omega' she had hoped to- hear. Really, it was pitiable, the credulity of some men; the ease with which they were imposed upon; their freedom from suspicion, despite the lessons of experience. She was meditating in this wise when Kate entered. In answer to her look of inquiry and surprise, Mrs. White -said that Mr. Kemper had called upon some matters of business connected with the deeds; that in the course of conversation she had mentioned her desire to go with her daughter to Monterne, and he had offered to take charge of them, having intended going there himself. As Kate had never before heard any mention of this de- sire on her mother's part, she was slightly incredulous as to the sincerity of the explanation, and said, in a tone of some displeasure, that she hoped her mother had not ac- cepted the offer, as she did not think they had any claim on Mr. Kemper; and, in view of former occurrences, she did not think it would look well at this time for them to go to a place of that description under his escort. "Mr. Kemper is rich enough not to care," said Mrs. White. "But we are not," answered Kate. "Well, we are poor enough, if that is any satisfaction. My health requires it, and so does your o\.n, and I hope,  if you are willing to sacrifice yourself to such a ridicu- lous whim, that you will have some regard for me. We 'have caused Mr. Kemper trouble enough, I think; if he chooses to forget it all, and still be our friend, I do not see why we should repel his advances and wound him still further."- We will not plunge the reader into the torrent of   Jimf-lp XXU sKKNLPs'.  .   '245 words with which Mrs. White now deluged her daughter. Suffice it, that Kate was deceived and yielded her objec- tions. Edith did not again remain at home awaiting her truant lover; and if she desired to see him early in the evening, her object was better accomplished by repairing, as she did, to the opera-house, where the first-object that her eye fell upon was Frank seated in the box opposite; by his side a girl, to whom he was talking with unwonted animation. Instantly Edith concluded that this was the magnet which had withdrawn him from herself, and all the jealousy she had felt of Florence was at once directed toward Frank's little cousin, who was for the first time at an opera, and who was delighting him by her naive enjoyment of the novelty. "Oh, look what a beautiful lady!" she exclaimed; and Frank, glancing in the direction indicated, saw Edith. As he looked up, he met her eye fixed full upon him, but before he could bow, she was again talking with the gentlemen who surrounded hertappearing not to have recognized him in her careless glance over the house. Her anticipated pleasure had fled; the enjoyment pro- duced by the flattery and attention lavished upon her could not be compared, even in intensity, to the pain and passion of her soul at the present moment. Yet her sparkling politeness answered well for the gayety of X a careless heart, and her enjoyment, though simulated, served to adorn the altar of her god. Artificial flowers are fittest for such a temple. At the moments during which good breeding and musical taste did not enjoin silence, her smiles were still fascinating, her conversa- tion as brilliant as though she had no wish unconnected with those around her. Frank forgot that he had halted in the midst of a  sentence, and continued to look at * 21*  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7897-00000124"/> 246      LEFT TO HERSELF. Edith, endeavoring to catch her eye, but found the effort vain. When not listening to Brignoli, she seemed en- grossed by her immediate attendants. Suddenly recol- lecting himself, he withdrew his gaze and finished his sentence with the assertion that that beautiful lady was! a great friend of his, and should call on his cousin before long. He then devoted to the latter his entire attention, nor looked again for some time toward Edith, which did not add to her enjoyment of the evening. When he did so, lie received a bow which he acknowledged with smiling empressement, but which proved insufficient to produce a further withdrawal of attention from his cousin. Having seen Miss Muncair safely home, and listened  for a time to her enthusiastic comments on city life, he- left her and repaired to Mr. Shelley's, for the purpose of securing a private interview with Edith; a pleasure which was, however, denied him, as several other gentlemen were present, and she did not honor him with undue notice. Finding her, indeed, less attentive to himself than to every one else, he went over to Mrs. Shelley, determined to find amusement somewhere. "Boys will be boys," said Mrs. Shelley. "They will be men," said Frank. This was not very amusing, so he had recourse to the card-basket; and presently, walking up to Edith with one of the cards in his hand, asked if she could decipher the name written on it. Above the name she read, "Shall you be at home to-morrow, at twelve?" "No," she answered, "'I cannot make it out;" and, carelessly reducing the paper to fragments, resumed the conversation he had interrupted. As soon as an opportunity offered, he said to her, "Miss Edith, I particularly wirsh to see you to-morrow; will you name an hour at which I may call?"   LEFT TO HERSELF.        247 With an assumed air of indifference she did so. True to his appointment, he called the next morning at eleven. During the exchange of platitudes, the con- versation progressed smoothly enough; but, beneath the easy indifference of Edith's manner, there lurked a some- thing which presaged a stormy interview, should sub- jects of greater moment be introduced. He soon dis- covered this, and readily imagined the reason; but his fears were in no degree aroused. the fact merely bestow- ing a shade more of interest upon an occasion that should not have required such an element to make it pleasurable in his eyes. She had left her room with bitterness in her heart, and a cold, proud smile upon her lip. She met him with easy cordiality; but he could detect no evidence of affection. "On the contrary, quite the reverse," he confidentially remarked to himself; and his want of deep feeling gave him an immense advantage over her. Nevertheless, it required all his tact to restore the amicable relations for- merly existing, without explanations that would have been embarrassing and wearisome, even irritating, if he had correctly divined the tone of her temper when she greeted him; for that did not foretell easy credulity, and his affection for her was not such as to induce him to submit patiently to undue exigeance. She was too proud to inquire why he had been so long albsent, and he was too skillful a tactician to enter at once into particulars of his dereliction. Therefore, they conversed for a time upon commonplace topics, but such as he knew would interest and entertain her; .his manner that of an assured lover, but with nothing in it, or in his words, sufficiently marked to afford her an excuse for re- pelling him. He seemed so quietly unconscious of hav- ing in the least offended or slighted her, that she began  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7897-00000125"/> 248      LEFT TO HERSELF. to question whether he really had been guilty, or she had only herself to blame for having been unreasonably ex- acting. The verdict rendered in her own mind was against him; but, true to the impulses of that irrational being, a loving woman, she was ready to believe herself wrong, and only needed a word from him to convince her that she was so. In this instance, no such word was given, yet a long time had not elapsed ere the bitterness was gone, and her smile had grown warmer, and, to her own subsequent surprise, she had promised to become his bride within the ensuing six weeks. Convinced now that he loved her,-else why urge her to marry' him?-pride lowered its head, and, conscious that in mere flirtation absence for a much longer period would not have alarmed her for her power, she readily condemned herself for having expected too much of him. Pride being at rest, curiosity- became importunate, and, yielding to its suggestion, she finally inquired what had so closely engaged him of late that he had not cared to see her. "Do you doubt that I have cared to see you? Are you already beginning to gather up the reins? Or is it only the discreet love of intelligence that is popularly supposed to characterize your sex? Tell me which prompts the question. But, in any event, I decline an- swering. I think you have doubted me, and merit punishment for the offense, so I award that of ungrati- fied curiosity. Perhaps, h!wever, if you are very kind to me, I may some day withdraw the terrible sentence. Even now it may be revoked, if you confess that you have wanted very much to see me, and have not been adequately consoled by the Count von Labenstein p" "You shall extort no such admission. The Count has   LEFT TO HERSELF.       249 been on duty almost every evening, and, to a deserter, I shall admit nothing to his disadvantage." "Seriously, dear Edith, it is very unpleasant to me to see the footing that man has gained in your father's house. That he is a foreigner is nothing; I am influenced by no such ignorant prejudice; anld, viewing him merely as a ball-room acquaintance, it is of no great consequence that you are ignorant of his antecedents. He is received in cultivated society, and seems well enough fitted for it. He behaves like a gentleman, and nothing more is de- manded of him as far as you are concerned, so long as he maintains a proper distance; but upon my word I have sometimes felt like ordering him out, and wondered that your brother could withstand the inclination. He walks into your parlor with an easy assurance; he takes his seat by your side with an impudent confidence; he addresses himself to you with a bold assumption which I am astonished that you endure for a moment. You will think me jealous,"-so she did, and was very glad he loved her well en0gpgh to be so,-" you will undoubt- edly pronounce. me-'very suspicious when I say that there seems to be an understanding, a-pardon me, dear Edith, I know you will call it nonsense, but I have fancied that there exists between you a degree of confi- dence. He seems to have some power over you. You are so cautious of offending him, so careful never to give him the slightest rebuff; yet it is quite evident to me that you do not like him so much as this would seem to indicate. What does it mean? Do you not concede nly right to ask?" "You fancy all this," she said, "because you do not like the Count. What power can he possess over me?" "I do not know; but the last time I saw Mrs. White '(the old lady) I heard her say to some one that she knew ' i "  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7897-00000126"/> 250      LEFT TO HERSELF. you had been engaged to Labenstein when in Paris. I knew this to be untrue, because in a previous discussion of the gentleman's claims you had pledged me your word to that effect. Nevertheless, it annoyed me. Believing the remark intended for my ears, and knowing the ma- licious feeling toward yourself that prompted it, I deter- mined to take no notice of it, but since the subject has been introduced, I cannot resist begging that you will give Labenstein his dismissal, and withdraw all color of truth from any assertion of this nature that Mrs. White may hereafter think proper to make. Will you do so?" For the first time in her life she accused herself of cowardice. For the first time in her life she was on the point of acting with noble bravery. Not so, either, since the step, however noble in seeming, was dictated by fear and contemplated only as a means of escape from greater peril. It flashed through her mind that she would lay- her hand in his, and, throwing aside all coquettish reserve, tell her future husband how dearly and deeply she loved him, how infinitely sweet to her was the promise with which he had pledged himself, to guard her lovingly and think of her tenderly through all their future life; how faithfully in that future she would endeavor to become more worthy of his love and mould her nature to what showed fairest in his eves. Then she would tell him how she and Ninette Vansi, before their debut, used to envy the elder girls of the fanmily their balls, and parties, and cavaliers, and how glad they were when Madame Vansi permitted them to join in any excursion, or, on any plea, to enter the drawing-room. She would tell him bow on such occa. sions the Count had flattered her self-love and stimulated her ambition by deserting the acknowledged belles and   LEFT TO HERSELF.        251 devoting himself exclusively to her,-Ninette Vansi being content with the lustre reflected upon herself as attachee She would tell bow Madame Vansi, being preoccupied with grand manceuvres for her elder daughters, had no time for lesser matters, and only thought it very kind that the Count should encumber himself with the charge of a couple of schoolgirls; how, through these means, he insensibly attained the position of l'ami de la maison; how he improved the advantage; how he pampered her vanity and fed her pride, and made her believe she loved him who gave her such gracious seeming in her own eyes. She would tell that Madame Vansi one day dis- covered all this, reproached him for clandestinely courting the heiress, and peremptorily ordered her to cease all in- tercourse with him. Apparently she did so; but this prohibition only gave a keener zest to the enjoyment with which, for more than a year, she and Ninette re- ceived his ardent letters and concocted tender epistles in return. Then she would sincerely add that when she had made her entree, and Madame Vansi no longer had authority for her prohibition, when it was at her own otion whether she should receive or reject the Count's addresses, they utterly lost their charm, and as other suitors came to woo, she saw the mistake she had made in supposing that she cared for him, except as one who could minister to her ambition. She rejected him more than once before leaving Paris, and did not see him again until they met at Saratoga. Then she would tell Frank of her return to New Orleans and her love for him. She would remind him of his bitter comments on the character of a flirt; she would acknowledge with deep shame the falsehood she had spoken, and beg him to forgive her, because of the love that had prompted it; implore him not to despise 4.x  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7897-00000127"/> 252       LEFT TO HERSELF. her, through the strength of the love he hada professed for her. It were useless to speculate regarding the effect this confession would have produced upon one of Frank's disposition. She had not the courage to make it. The words died upon her lip. The thoughts passed unuttered through her heart. The impulse faded silently, and one hope fled-forever. She reflected on the remark Mrs. White had made in Frank's hearing, and was now convinced of something she had hitherto doubted,-that Wilhelm had spoken the truthhwhen he said he had seen Mrs. White secrete those letters. There would be little risk, then, in discarding him. "I Granting that the request be unreasonable, will you not, Edith, because I make it, finally and unequivocally dismiss Von Labenstein?" "Yes. I promise it. Mrs. White has never forgiven me for the indignity to which I subjected her on the night of Kate's projected elopement. I am not surprised at anything she says of me." "How is it that you still visit?" asked Frank. "Oh, I don't know. Charlie insisted that I should call on Kate when she returned after her marriage, urged that she had so few real friends, was unhappy, and so forth. I called, and Mrs. White came with Kate when she returned the visit." Edith then introduced the subject of theatricals, and Frank so decisively put his veto upon her acting in pub- lic as proposed by Mr. Day, that she was compelled most reluctantly to forego the pleasure of winning fur. ther applause. Frank could hardly repress an expres- sion of his astonishment at her desire to take part in such an exhibition; but she was so evidently in earnest   LEFT TO HERSELF.        253 that he thought it best to content himself with the ex- torted promise that she would not do so. A full expres- sion of his feeling would have been too decided a reflec- tion upon her ideas of propriety. Frank had so far, with a steadfast mind, pursued his purpose of fulfilling his vows to Edith. If he could not love her as he had loved Florence Lockhart, assuredly he liked and admired her sufficiently to secure her happiness and his own content. He was not conscious of claiming credit for the performance of this duty, as he considered it; for his mental assertion was that he was only acting honorably, and honor being the birthright of a gentle- man, nothing less could be expected of him;-yet he founded on it a claim to the privilege of seeing Florence again. - He felt that he might grant himself this reward. He returned to Mr. Shelley's during the evening, and was admitted by Harry, who, presuming Mr. Muncair knew the way into the parlor, unceremoniously left him to take it. Instead of entering through the side door of the back parlor, as the servant would have indicated, Mr. Muncair advanced through the front roonm, and this being but dimly lighted, a very pretty relief was afforded to the tableau before him: books, flowers, pictures, and musical instruments, engravings, and statuettes; near the centre a quaintly-carved tete-'-tete, its occupants a lady and her cavalier. She was talking eagerly. He lield her hand, and as he bent over her his attitude was that of an auditor; but the smile of intense admiration with which his eyes were fixed upon the beautiful face upturned to him betrayed -to the beholder that his thoughts were of her, not of what she was saying. They were Edith and the Count von Labenstein. As Frank advanced, the Count released Edith's hand and leaned back. She was startled, almost frightened, 22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7897-00000128"/> 254       LEFF TO HERSELF. and with embarrassed haste begged the newcomer to be seated. His air disowned the hot blood in his cheek. Very quietly he thanked her, and remained standing. "Is your brother at home? Harry admitted me, but- left sojprecipitately that I had no time to ascertain." "No. Charlie went out immediately after tea. Will you not take a seat?" "-Thank you. I design spending the evening at Mr. Lockhart's, and it is already late. I will not tax your patience so-severely, Miss Edith, as to extend this morn- ing's infliction. Count, commend my unselfishness." Disregarding the wistful entreaty of her eyes, Frank bowed low and left the house. She had been attempting to induce the Count to ob- tain her letters from Mrs. White, and to his expostulating interrogatory as to how on earth such a thing could be accomplished, she had answered, desperately, "Demand them of her; tell her you saw her take them. It will not be pleasant, Wilhelm; but for my sake, for my happi- ness-how can I bear to have that woman read those letters?.-look into my heart, and read every feeling of my soul,-how can you love me and endure it?"These were the words with which she had been addressing Labenstein while Frank advanced through the front parlor. She stood as he had left her, listening to his retreating footsteps. Was she forever to be tortured with regret and jealousy? Mindful only of the serpent's tooth, sending such sharp pangs throughout her soul, she for- got the part she had herself performed, she ignored the fact that it was not the Count's familiarity, but her tolerance of it, that had offended Frank, and was filled with-resentful passion' toward the man who had driven her lover from her side to that of her rival. She stood'   LEFT TO HERSEL.        255 a few paces in front of Labenstein, listening to Frank's footsteps; picturing to herself the feelings he must enter- tain toward her at the present moment, hardly daring to think of the contrast he would make between her and her "saintly" cousin. Oh, that he would not go there! that he would but come back, believing she might be false but not to. him I Fainter, fainter,-through the hall, through the portico,-they died away. The Count requested her to resume her seat, and she turned as if to'do so. A thunder-bolt from a clear sky is sometimes a poor simile. Labenstein would have thought so had it been used in description of the scene that followed. He was absolutely incredulous of his senses. He looked at her with an air almost of stupefaction. Then came a frown of angry amazement, as he found himself unequivocally, angrily, and contemptuously discarded. He controlled himself. He implored, persuaded, entreated. He used every argument that love could offer, made every effort that love could suggests. His persuasions were as idle winds- that blow against a granite crag. At once, and fully, he realized her treachery. In an instant it flashed upon him that she had made a tool of him, and would now cast him off with as little thought as though he had been created but as an humble instrument in the carving out of her brilliant destiny. "Fool I I see it now. Muncair loves you I You are engaged to him l" She drew herself up to her full height, and proudly threw back her head, her manner full of defiance; yet through it all a glad smile shone in her eyes and rested on her curved lip.- Ah! she was gloriously, royally beauti- ful I crowned with the joy of being loved. Triumphantly she gazed back into his angry eves: "Yes, he loves me,.'  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7897-00000129"/> 256      LEFT TO HERSELF. Her glance wandered off; her head drooped; a sweet smile played upon her lips, as if to herself she repeated, softly," He loves me." His rage burst through all restraint. "Loves you? No 1 As you have deceived me, he is deceiving you. As you have jilted me, he will yet jilt you. Loves you? He loved your cousin before he saw you. He loves her now as he did then. A smile from her is dearer to him than your whole artillery of charms i What has he cared for you when she was present? What has he cared for you when be could staticd himself by her side? Are you a woman, and cannot read the face of a ]over? No, he is deceiving yqu, and you are deceiving yourself far more cruelly than you have deceived me. Yes; your pleading has not been in vain.

Reading them, and seeing me no longer at your feet, a charitable world might readily suppose that I had refused to fulfill my part of the obligation." Waiting one moment to curb her towering passion, she exclairned,-- "You refuse to marry me? Refuse?"' She spoke with intense bitterness. Checking herself, she continued in a tone half of banter, half of pity: "Wilhelm Labenstein, do you suppose I ever intended to marry you? Poor dupe --dupe, indeed, of the woman you loved; yes, you did, you do, and you ever will love me; but if you sup- pose my heart ever throbbed with one sentiment of affec- tion for you, you deceive yourself and wrong me. Love you? Marry you " The parlor rang with her scornful laugh. "He whom you love shall see how well you have loved -me.)" \.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        257 " "You threaten?" "Yes. And, lady fair, I do not threaten in vain. Pride, it is said, goeth before a fall. I have likened you to Lucifer. Was he not proud? Did he'not fall?" A flush of disdain rose to her cheek, erewhile pale with a thought she seemed to fear. A dangerous light shone in her dark eyes. Again she drew herself up to her full height, and pointed with an imperious gesture to- ward the door. Von Labenstein, fascinated by her regal beauty, stood for a moment irresolute, then vanished from the room. Frank spent the evening at Mr. Lockhart's, but he was absent, silent, unhappy, almost as much so as if he had loved Edith. His pride was wounded to the quick. Florence, observing his disinclination to converse, ad- dressed herself almost entirely to John. Frank sat look- ing at her with an intentness that would have been embar- rassincg had he permitted her to discover it. He asked of himself, "Why cannot this girl come to my side, and place her cool hand on my brow? Why can she not address to me the words those lips were formed to utter? Why can she not devote to the adornment of my home the graces of her true heart and gentle manner? She. loved me once, and for what have I bartered the promise of such happiness? For the privilege of mlnistering to the vanity of a coquette by profession; for the\ honor of gratifying the ambition of a woman who, ere /he echo of her vows to ame has died away, places her hand in that of the first who asks for it, and is all to him in the even- ing that she was to me at noon." These thoughts were becoming too unpleasant, and he would fain have left, but not just then, for he had too much tact-which, you know, is only a refinement of 22*  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7897-00000130"/> 958      LEFT TO ZERSSLF. common sense, common sense in full dress-ever to select the period of an awkward pause as the timne for his departure; leaving not only an impression of his own dullness, but an uncomfortable suspicion on the part of his hostess that she had not contributed her quota of entertainment. Again was Edith's heart sick with the sickness that cometh of hope deferred. For days she vainly awaited Frank's return. She hardly left the house, fearful that be would call during her absence, yet could hardly resist going out, hoping to see him if but by accident. Feeling that he could not forever remain absent with. out some explanation, he at length visited her again, but on this occasion it was she who was called upon to play the tactician; and she enacted a role so foreign to her nature that only the sihcerest affection could have dic- tated or induced her to adopt it. She acknowledged her- self in the wrong, and asked that he would forgive her, excusing herself on the plea that Labenstein was an old friend and the friend of old friends, and that her only wish had been to reject him as gently and kindly as pos- sible. He answered coolly that she must have done it very gently and very kindly indeed, judging from appear- ances. She replied that she bad, at any rate, done it de- cisively and finally, addingthat the Count had not intended to be impertinent or familiar, but the customs of his native land entitled him to disregard the fancies of prudish beauties, and, she archly added, Southern beaus. But he was in no jesting mood, and said in reply,- "When Labenstein takes you to Germany you can con- form to the customs of his native land, but I do not care that they be kept fresh in his memory through the aid of my affianced. I would not permit it in my wife, and I will not submit to it from my betrothed."   "EzF TO HERSELF.       259 Edith was totally unaccustomned to this manner of ad- dress, and it was only after a mental struggle she could frame the soft answer that turned away his wrath. She conquered herself, however, and finally conquered hili; at any rate, so skillfully soothed his irritated feelings that when they parted it was apparently with the cordial affec- tion of a week ago. Ere long milliners and mantuamakers found employ- ment, while Miss Shelley's trousseau and the coming fes- tivities on the occasion of Miss Shelley's marriage be- came the topic of interest, almost as intense to herself as to those whom the event in no degree concerned. John came home one evening so pale and haggard that Florence was frightened. Was he sick? No. As usual, on coming into the house,-for he was not strong,- he threw himself on the lounge, and covered his eyes -with his arm. Florence stood for a moment irresolute, then took up her sewing, and silently awaited the revelation he would presently make, whether of physical suffering or mental pain. She had not long to wait. "Frank Muncair has been here a good many times  lately, has he not?" "No, not a great many. Why?" "Do you know that he is to be married?" Ah, Florence, why that sudden pain? Why that im- pulse to say yes? Why that unsteady tone as you an- swer no? "He and Edith Shelley are to be married on the twen- tieth of next month." "How do you know?"  "It is true. Charles told me not ten minutes ago." She had no word of comfort for him. Since the death of her mother she had been almost a recluse; had heard none of the gossip of the city; had seen only Frank 9 i  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7897-00000131"/> 260       LEFT TO HERSELF. among the gentlemen whose acquaintance she had formed, and he was himself unaware of the extent to which he had betrayed his feelings for her. She had become con- vinced that he did not love Edith, and censured herself for the wrong she had probably done him by her hastyv rejection ; yet till now she had not been observant of the extent to which she was permitting a renewal- of her affection. Truly she had no word of comfort for John. Nor had John been till now aware of the hope that had still lingered within him, vague, undefined, irrational, yet warm, and sweet, and lovely, as only hope can be. He rose abruptly, went to his room, and, locking the door, yielded to a storm of feeling too violent not to be soon exhausted, reproaching himself for not having renounced all things for her sake; reproaching Florence for not having urged him to do so; reproaching Edith for her perfidy; almost reproaching Heaven for its cruelty. "Oh, that there should be Things which we love with such deep tenderness, But through that love to learn how much of woe Dwells in an hour like this!" Florence took her usual place at the head of the table, poured out her father's coffee, listened to his summary of news, and in return gave such an epitome of the day's events as she knew would be of interest to him. After tea she was sitting alone in the parlor, when she was startled by hearing on the portico a step that she knew too well, and had not thought to hear again within her home. Her first impulse was to fly; why or whither she hardly knew. When Frank entered she was quietly embroidering a pair of slippers. Every day which brought nearer that of his marriage seemed to render Frank more irritable, more petulant, more   LEFT TO HERSELF.       261 unlike himself; or, th give his own version, he sometimes had the headache, often had the rheumatism, and was alwavs afflicted with troublesome business and stupid lawyers. Had Edith acted differently, it is difficult to determine what charge Frank would have brought against her in his own mlind; as it was, he persuaded himself that she thought more of her wardrobe than of the bride- groom elect, and looked forward with more delight to the entertainments projected for her than to the quiet tete- a-tetes with himself that might take place in a lifetime. He no longer addressed himself, as of yore, to Edward Bertnord, and, truth to tell, the latter being entirely out of patience with him, was content to leave him to his own devices. But to have seen Edith of her own accord discard Mr. Muncair, Edward would have been willing, for the remainder of his days, to live by mending the pens of a village schoolmaster. Following the bent of a reckless and selfish mood, Frank found himself seated opposite Florence. Pursuing his own pleasure solely, he made other days the theme of conversation, and dwelt upon his visit to Virginia with a tone and emphasis that she knew he had no present right to use. Placing himself on the sofa -beside her, and raising the work from her lap, he asked if the slippers were for him. She said they were for her father. "Give them to me for a bridal present," said Frank. "They are not handsome enough." "I want them because you worked them. Will you give them to me?" "No, but I will embroider you another pair, which I will endeavor to render sufficiently elegant to suit the rest of your wardrobe. These poor things would walk off of their own accord, driven to the step by mortified vanitv."  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7897-00000132"/> "Make me another pair, then. They will have addi- tional value if worked especially for mue. I will never leave them nor forsake them, but keep them as long as I live -" "No doubt. If you keep them till the first tint fades I shall be sufficiently flattered and---" Well- and what?" "Very much surprised." "That is not sincere. Should you be surprised? And why?" "Because slippers are useless things to young gentle- men, and there is no reason why you should value them." He rested his elbow on his knee, his head on his hand, and looked up in her face. "Not if you worked them?" he asked, in a low tone. "Certainly not," she replied with quiet self-posses- sion. "Have I not loved you?" She was annoyed, almost angered, and replied with an accent of some bitterness, "I do not know, indeed." "There you are again insincere. You know that I have loved you. You know more than that. You know more than I dare tell you.'" She looked at him a moment with an air of cold sur- prise, then silently resumed her embroidery. The rebuke seemed sufficient, and silently his eyes followed the needle as it glanced in and out among the flowers. At length, he again yielded to his reckless spirit. "- - Did you ever read a little poem called 'Jenny Eagle- heart?' he asked. "I do not remember having done so." "Then you have never read it. It is simple, but as sweet a little thing as was ever penned. So at least it seems to me. Possibly I think more highly of it than   ,-.,..d-'  .- '"' v " t J5     ' those would who have never been taught to understand it, May I read it to you?" "As you choose." Apparently unobservant of her coldness, he took a memorandum-book from his breast-pocket, and looked deliberately among its papers. Having selected one, he turned to her and commenced reading. As he finished, he looked up. She was still sewing, but with flushed cheeks and unsteady fingers. "Oh, God! That broke the dream I dreamed For many and many a year. I loved you, Jenny Eagleheart; My soul was not so dear As the little agate ear-ring That glimmered at your ear. "I love you, Jenny Eagleheart; God pardon me if I Have let this bitter love come in Between me and the. sky; But I love you, Jenny Eagleheart, With a love that cannot die." a           .   I   *   X  It had been impossible to mistake his meaning, impos- sible to mistake the tone of tenderness with which the lines had" been repeated, impossible to avoid the eyes that so determinately sought her own, or to misinter- pret words so aided by his voice. Had he been free, it would have been equally impossible to repress the re- sponding echoes of her heart; but now, she could only feel indignantly conscious of the wrong of which he was guilty toward herself as well as Edith. Having waited vainly for a moment or two, for any comment on the little rhyme he had read, he laid it on her lap. "I am to be married on the twentieth of this month. Did you know it?"  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7897-00000133"/> "Yes. Will you wait till then to receive my con- gratulations, or shall I tender them now?" "I can wait. And I suppose you think you were right in rejecting me as you did." "I do." "You were altogether wrong. I had not addressed Miss Shelley. I did not love her. Do you believe I love her now as I then loved you?" "Mr. Muncairl"  She rose, the utmost displeasure marked in voice and bearing. He stood before her. "And you deny me even the assassin's privilege of self-defense?" "Your present conduct admits of no defense. For the second time -you have forfeited my respect. Could you offer it, for the second time I would reject your hand." He folded his arms and smiled. "Florence Lockhart  Absolutely, I glory in you! More than that-I love you. " She turned, as if to leave the room. "One moment, Miss Florence, and I relieve you of my presence. I dare tell you this, because I know you do not love me, and it can do you no harm to hear it; also, it may induce more kindly feelings on your part, to know that you wronged me long ago, and suspected me unjustly. All that in my'subsequent conduct has seemed to declare you right in the course you then pursued was the result of your " "Mr. Muncair, will you be kind enough to explain your motive in addressing these words to me?" "Soon I shall have no right, possibly no inclination to do so; and while there is yet time, I wish to convince you that I have never at any moment acted dishonorably toward you. I have wronged myself. I may have wronged others. I have never wronged you."   To do him justice, he really did not believe that Flor- ence loved him, or would at any moment have accepted him, since their parting in Lorburg; and -having, with characteristic impulsiveness, engaged himself to Edith, he did not for a moment contemplate casting upon Flor- ence the -odium of having been flirted with ; yet while acting (as he believed) fairly and honorably in this re- spect, he was taught by the "imp of the perverse" to desire more than ever the society he had forfeited. He rarely denied himself a pleasure that he could command, no matter what the prospective cost of indulgence, and yielded to his fancy for seeing Florence as he would have yielded to intemperance, had he been immoderately fond of wine, or to the habit of gaming, had that vice possessed inordinate attraction in his eyes. Truly, he would have been at a loss for a rational explanation of his motive in addressing those words to Florence. The house of God is hardly the place wherein to in- dulge resentful feeling; yet this was the emotion with which, on the Sunday evening following Frank's visit, Florence saw Edith and her lover enter the church of which John was minister. It was Frank's habit to attend there when on pious deeds intent; and Edith had occa- sionally done so, but now their united presence seemed an intentional insult to John, and one which Florence could hardly forgive. To some extent she was misled. Edith had gone there because Frank had asked her. Of late, she had bestowed no thought on John for good or ill. And Frank had asked her because he was almost certain of seeing Florence at St. 's. John, also, started at sight of that lovely face. An- other minister was reading the service, and John placed himself where he might not see her. 23    &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7897-00000134"/> He was worn out. His eyes looked hollow; his shoulders bent. He supported himself with his right hand. As was his custom, he paused before speaking, and looked steadily into the faces of the people before him, as if to establish communion between them. There was about him a kind of magnetism. He stood calm, earnest, self-contained. Before he opened his lips, the hearers' thoughts became obedient to his leading. At first he spoke in a low tone, but soon his eye brightened and his form straightened, his voice grew stronger and his words eager. Again he was overpowered by physical weakness. His arm fell by his side, great drops of perspiration stood upon his brow; his voice sank almost to a whisper. He passed his handkerchief across his forehead, and again leaned heavily on the desk. "Say, even to love-' Hinder me not.'" Edith then knew that where he had bowed down he had not fallen; she then, for the first time, imagined the bitter pain she had cost him ; she then, for the first tinme, regretted the folly that had urged her to arouse this struggle. As he lifted up his. hands, the people rose and stood with bowed heads to receive the benediction. It was uttered like a prayer. "And now-may the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,-be among you-and remain with you always. Amen." It was his farewell. He never saw her again. Bowing his head on the book before him, he remained in prayer; while she, radiant with youth and health, pre- eminent in beauty, her lover by her side, moved slowly down the aisle, and turned her steps away from the house of God.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        267 Many years after, John sat on the piazza of the house in which Mr. Shelley had lived when first married. He had not sold the place, and would never allow the house to be occupied. After a long time, John interrupted himself in his musing, and, tearing a leaf from his note- book, commenced writing to a friend who was to him as Jonathan unto David: "It is the 22d of October, 18-. The afternoon is cold, and dark, and dreary. Most of the leaves have fallen from the trees, and mouldered into the earth, or lie crisp, and brown, and lifeless upon the clay, above which they once danced proudly in the summer breeze, or gayly swung amid golden sunbeams. The trees, too, seem old and withered, and stretching before them their unpro- tected arms, grope blindly for the sunlight. Chanting the funeral hymn of the dead summer, they strip them- selves of their gorgeous vestment, and lowly bow their heads. The wail grows deeper. The leaves fall flutter- ing to the earth, and, withering, die; the wind rushes on through the dismantled forest, and whirling the dead leaves in chaotic waltzes, moves, with melancholy voice, ever on; all its melodies in a minor key, every chant a requiem. Stand with me in the spirit at this open win- dow and view the scene before us. When the caresses of a summer's sun wake nature into life, this spot is one of the loveliest ever made; and even in winter you can- not but glory in the rugged grandeur that you see around you. There are few places, even in Virginia, more beautiful than this portion of what was known as the ' Shelley property;' and the mansion, now in many places fallen and decayed, was at one time deemed a palace. The garden stretching before me, now almost a waste, was once brilliant with carefully tended flowers; the arbor, now fallen and decayed, once supported heavy clusters  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7897-00000135"/> of the grape, and lent its aid to the ambitious multiflora. How greatly have all things changed I Shutterless win- dows; doors without hinges; tottering balustrades; de- cayed flooring! The carpet upon this, once the drawing- room floor, is now faded and worn by the unceasing tread of time; and the old-fashioned mirror, which erst presented varying pictures of youth, and freshness, and beauty, reflects now the unchanging view-of black deso- lation, broken plastering, mouldering walls, cobwebbed ceilings I "The first woman I ever loved was born in this house. Her baby feet once tottered across these floors. Her childish hands may have planted the jasmine that clam- bers over the doorway. It saddens me. Alas I Alas I Well-let the ' dead past bury its dead!' "My wife sends her warnlest love to you all, and says she shall be happy in her new home, though but a 'cduntry preacher's wife,' if, by removing from the at- tractive vicinity of town, she can deliver our boys from the opprobrium of being as bad as a parson's son, which she seems to think is being very bad indeed. "My little cottage, half a mile distant, looks homelike and inviting. My wife and children are there; my heart is there I Between ourselves, I think it likely that hot muffins may be found there also, at or about this hour, and cream, my dear fellow, whereof your town palate knoweth not --the taste, neither can devise imagining of the same I We long to see you; when are you coming?" ,.-1   t     -L'EAFY TU R-NO1CZbJf 'O CHAPTER XXII. IT was about twelve o'clock when Charles, finding that his watch had run down, entered Mr. Shelley's chamber for the purpose of ascertaining the hour. Struck by the expression of his father's features, he hastily inquired, "What is the matter, sir? are you ill?"Mr. Shelley in vain attempted to articulate an answer, and Charles, sus- pecting that he had had another stroke of paralysis, vio- lently rang the bell, summoning several servants, two or three of whom hurried off for a physician. ' Where is Edith?" "Gone to Mrs. Walton's, sir.' "Mrs. Shelley?" "She gone, too, sir. Master say he didn't feel noways so very bad, sir, and wouldn't let no one stay wid him.7' "Here, take this note to Mrs. Walton's as fast as you can. Don't stop a minute. Have it taken to your Miss Edith."' Edith and Mr. Kemper were sitting in a bay-window conversing with mirth considerably tinged with malice. Mrs. White stood near, and looking out of the corner of her eyes, saw without turning her head that they were speaking of herself. It was true she had never forgiven Edith her dexterity with the lasso on the night: of Kate's elopement, and there had been nothing in her subsequent behavior, there was nothing in the sarcastic glee with which she was now conversing, at all calculated to con- ciliate an enemy. "Oh, that I might but be there to witness the catas- trophe!" 23* V?    &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7897-00000136"/> Z7U      L  ,'FT TO HERSELS'. To avoid appearing to speak of any particular person, Mr. Kemper seemed engaged in careless examination of Edith's fan, while he replied, in an undertone, "You would enjoy it. Pardon me for not extending an invitation, but you know the scene will be of a nature so strictly domestic that you are inevitably excluded." "Mrs. White greatly prefers Irish servants. Might I not enter service, forsake my father and forswear my name, and be no longer aught but Biddy?" "You will have forsaken your father and forsworn your-name long ere---"  He was interrupted by a mes- senger bearing Charlie's note. The physician had arrived, and Mr. Shelley had been removed from his couch to the bed when Edith reached home. She knelt beside him, and tears fell on the shrunken hand she held within her own, while she reproached her- self for having left him alone and unwell. As she knelt there " in gloss of satin and glimmler of pearls," the voice of laughter and music still ringing in her ears, she would have given all-all-to have redeemed the carelessness and disrespect of-which she had been too often guilty to- ward her father. Mr. Shelley beheld her tears and looked affectionately at her, but his eyes followed his son, and as Charles drew near, Edith felt that her father was about to withdraw his hand.  It was hardly a movement, yet she felt it, and, rising, seated herself on the opposite side of the bed.  As Charles met the look with which his father regarded him, and witnessed his distressing at- tempts at articulation, his eyes swam in tears; in vain he bit his lip, and tried to keep them back. He unclasped the withered hand, and hastened from the bedside. How quiet the house was! How strangely looked the famnil- iar rooms colored with this hush I   I     1,.-tP' 2'U R iS^ELhF.     271 What an unreal mockery life can seem I! Fashionable visitors drove to the door; cards and invitations were left; the ladies were "really very sorry to hear of Mr. Shelley's illness, hoped he would soon recover;" wondered if he would die, calculated the amount of his property, and drove on in search of means whereby to kill time. Charles walked down with the physician who had seen his father, and, as they stood in the hall while Dr.  drew on his overcoat, asked him to say candidlyv what he thought of his father's case. "Well, sir," said -the doctor, taking up his hat and walking slowly into the parlor,-" well, sir, I will not dis- guise the truth. It is impossible to tell how longr he mnay linger, but thit, you know, is his second attack, and has been so severe that I fear it will prove fatal."' "Do you----"Poor Cliarlie! He set his teeth hard, and tried to conquer that choking feeling in his throat, but it would not do. He turned and walked to the other end of the hall. Coming back presently, he asked, "Do you think it will be hurtful to inform him of his danger, sir?1" "1 No. I think- he is not unprepared for it, Mr. Shelley, and if you wish him to communicate his wishes in regard to any of his affairs, I advise you to act at once." "I do not wish to trouble him about temporal affairs, sir; but though not myself a Christian, I should be bet. ter satisfied if my father were to see a minister. Ivcan-. not bear to think of his-that he should---" "You are right, my dear sir. Tell your father, then, or if you cannot, painful as the office necessarily is, I j will undertake it at your desire; but it will be better to defer it till my next visit." "Thank you, sir; thank vou. I could not do it, and I know from the sympathy you have already manifested,  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7897-00000137"/> that it will be done as gently as may be. We are deeply indebted to you, doctor. Your'kindness can never be forgotten." He wrung the doctor's hand, and they parted. The sound of the physician's foot upon the oil-cloth as be walked through the hall, the sound of his voice as he coughed while crossing the portico, were' never forgotten by Charles. What an indelible impression such trifles make on our minds I We are ill in childhood, kind friends come to see us; for a time, we laugh as they tell of all that has happened while we have been sick; of the beautiful doll in a shop window, or the splendid pony that we may ride if we will make haste and get well; but then we turn wearily away, and, holding our mother's band, are lulled to sleep by the subdued voices near us and distant noises from the street, or we fix our eyes upon a crack in the wall or the ceiling, and reason vaguely as to what caused it, how long it has been there. We wonder who saw it first, and if it seemed to them like a man's face. We sleep. Age creeps upon us.  Blessings and misfortunes have befallen us, and that illness of our childhood is forgotten; but sickness again prostrates us, and as we lie in our darkened chamber, half dreaming, half thinking, every circumstance is recalled in hues as vivid as if the shadows of years- had not fallen upon them. We have not for- gotten the crack in the wall, we see again the kind faces that have long since ceased to smile, We hold once more the band that was ever soothing, we hear again the voices of boys shouting at their sports. Mr. Shelley received the information of his danger with great calmness, having no wish to live in his present state of helplessness. The first time Charles was alone with him, he urged his desire that his father should see   a minister of the gospel, and Mr. Shelley, after a fixed look at his son's anxious face, yielded without opposition. It comforted Charlie. What passed within the heart of the sick man is known only to God, his maker and his judge. A pall was thrown over the bridal veil. Edith's mar- . riage was deferred till the coming winter, when it would take place privately. CHAPT ER    XXIII. W:E will not follow in detail the movements of our friends during the summer. Mr. Kemper escorted Mrs. White and Kate to " a re- tired watering-place;" allowed the former to impose on him in every possible manner, and exacted in return only that she should overrule Kate's ideas of the respect due the memory of her lord and master deceased. Alive, Mr. Kemper had despised him thoroughly; dead, he thought of him no more. Alive, Mrs. White bad sought only to make use of him; dead, she could do"..o no longer. Mr. Kemper cared too little what the world said to allow it to interfere with his happiness. Mrs. White cared too greatly what the world said not to say to a fortune as the Thane of Cawdor to the phantom dagger: "Come, let me clutch thee i"Therefore, they were agreed upon one point, that Kate should be married during the following winter; and though Mrs. White expressed many delicate scruples on the subject, they proved not in- vincible, and served only to elicit from Mr. Kemper expres-  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7897-00000138"/> sions of unbounded gratitude for concessions so gener- ously made. What Kate thought, except that she loved him, and felt assured of being happy as his wife, seemed in no degree to concern either party. Florence accepted an urgent invitation to visit the country with Mrs. Gilbert, an old ladv, who, during Mrs. Lockhart's illness, had been indefatigable in kindness, and now wished Florence to enjoy the delicious repose, the dreamy calm, yet full of life, which is perfect in itself and in its surroundings only in the country. And oh I dear reader,-courteous-kind-intelligent, or whatever you prefer to be called,-what is more delightful than a Sabbath-day in the woods? Without the sound of bells, without the sight of people, God's footstool for your chapel, his sunbeams for the steeple, w"lispering leaves the plriests, birds the unpaid choir, flowers swinging incense, higher, higher, higher I God blessed the seventh day! Charles, Edith, Mrs. Shelley, and Harry went to Vir- ginia, purposing to visit the different watering-places in the mountains. ,rank had once told Edith of a summer spent by hinmself at the Red Sulphur Springs, in Roanoke County, while  convalescent from an attack of typhoid rever; and the fact of his having been there invested'the place with interest sufficient to determine her to give it the precedence of more fashionable localities. At "Bonsack's Depot," on the Virginia and Tennessee railroad, three ladies and two gentlemen entered the cars, and three of the party seated themselves just in front of Charles, who was separated by the passage-way from his aunt and sister. They had hardly done so, when one of the ladies said to the gentleman with her: "Do look at the lady just behind us, Cousin Tom, on the left, and tell me if you ever saw one person more like another than she is to Florence Lockhart?",    He turned, addressing some remark to the gentleman who had entered with them, and, while doing so, glanced at Edith. "Very much so, indeed," was his reply; *.' I think I never saw a greater resemblance " The lady then wrote something on her fan, which was handed to "Cousin D.." and he immediately directed a glance toward Edith, but as he could see only the crown of her bonnet, the exertion was for the present superfluous. "Evidently," thought Charles, who had overheard and observed all this, "they are interested in Florence, are probably intimate friends. I wonder who they are; per- haps I have met them as little girls at my uncle's." " Why, Lee," said some one on the platform, "you are not going to leave us? Whither bound?" "To the Roanoke Red." "What for? Why not stay at Coyner's?" "Oh, we've been here long enough. We are to meet some friends at the Greenbrier White in about ten days; and my cousins here profess a desire to visit the Roanoke Red in the mean time. It is an exceedingly pretty and picturesque little place,-the rooms clean, the servants attentive, Chapman accommodating and polite; so, at least, I found everything last summer. D. and I were there for a-few days." "I have a great mind to join you." "And if my recommendation of the place is not justi- fied, on leaving you will be repaid for the disappointment by your drive over the mountain in the early morning. Come over to-morrow." "So I will. Good-by." Arrived at Salem our friends took places in the same omnibus and drove to " Chapman's." I wish I had time and space to immortalize Uncle Daniel, the head-waiter &amp;t said hotel, but he would require a volume.  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7897-00000139"/> An hour after their arrival at Chapman's, Charles and the two Lees were seated on the front porch, their feet on the railing, cigars between their lips, the conversation unflagging. It turned out that the Lees lived in Lor- burg, that they had been schoolmates of Charles, and that their cousins, the ladies, were intimately acquainted with the Lockharts. How they laughed as they recalled the half-forgotten incidents of school-days Hthe names and appearance of different scholars; the hobbies and peculiarities of their various tutors. Edith wondered what awoke the boisterous "ha, ha!" which she recoo- nized as Charles's laugh of genuine enjoyment. Soon after he knocked at her door. "So aunty is asleep," said he, looking toward the bed, across which Mrs. Shelley had extended herself. "Of course she is," said Edith, with a contemptuous pucker of the lip. "Do you suppose any human being would consciously present such an appearance as that? See her mouth ready for any possible dental operation I I have a great mind to have every one of her teeth ex- tracted for looking so ugly. When will the stage be here? I am so warm and tired that I hardly know what to do with myself." So she was. Warm and wearied, impatient, and thoroughly out of temper. "Why in the world do you not lie down  and go to sleep?  The stage will not be here for two hours." "Pshaw I! I  wish we had never come." "So do I, if you are so tired already. Where is Harry?" "I don't know; watering the omnibus horses in all probability." "Do you remember the three ladies who came up in the omnibus with us?" asked Charlie. "You should, I   am sure. You stared at them  as   if you had never seen three ordinary looking girls "They are by no means what would be called ordinary look " "No," she interposed, with a provoking laugh, " any- where but at a little hotel in the suburbs of creation they would be called very extraordinary looking, I should think. They are indigenous to the soil of Salem, I pre- Charlie drew his eyes together, and began-whistling. Somebody else was getting out of temper. "We shall probably be thrown together, and I came up to ask that you would form their acquaintance." "Would do what?"She looked at him with unfeigned astonishment. "Form their acquaintance, I said," he replied, in a tone considerably above a whisper. "They are inti- mately acquainted with Uncle John's family. Florence has written and talked of them to me a thousand times, and they could have no higher recommendation. I know them to be agreeable, lady-like girls." "Those omnibus people?" "They are of as good a family as ours. The ladies are as highly cultivated and refined as yourself. The men more worthy, perhaps, the ' grand old name of gen- tleman' than I have ever been." "Well. What of it?" "Nothing," he answered, "as far as you are con- cerned," and walked out of the room. Had Charlie not mentioned Florence in connection with the young ladies, Edith, after a night's rest and a satisfactory toilet, would have acceded to his xequest re- garding them, but in naming their relations with the Eockharts he had banished all possibility of cordial 24  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7897-00000140"/> acquaintance. Hereafter, she conducted herself in a manner that incensed Charlie beyond measure; a man. ner pointed and polished and cold as an icicle, and which became more pointed and colder still as he attached him- self more familiarly to the Lee party. Had not Edith so studiously held herself aloof she might have been convinced of what she now only sur. mised, that her brother was very much in love with one of his new friends. In ten days the Lees left. On the second day following, Charles was also impatient to be off. Under other circumstances, Edith would have acquiesced instantly. As it was, nothing could be pleas- anter than staying at the Roanoke Red; she meant to do so for at least two weeks longer. At the close of a warm discussion of this matter, she intimated that he wished to go to the Greenbrier White only to see the most bourgeoise member of that bourgeoise party from the emporium of Lugs. "You think so, do you?" he asked. "Assuredly." "And you intend to prevent it, I suppose?" "At any rate, I shall not publicly connect myself with that class of people." Charles possessed that quiet, steady temperament which is ever bard to arouse, but when once excited, prompt and fierce to execute its purpose. Curtly thanking her for having explained herself, he sought his aunt. "Harry is old enough," he said, "to take care of you and Edith, and even were he not, in this good old Com- monwealth ladies are never neglected. I shall return in X week or ten days." "Why, where are you going?"' "To   the Greenbrier White. To see Miss Lee, of Lorburg."    "And we are to stay here?" "As you choose about that. Edith says she intends to remain a fortnight. I do not." "Dear me," said Mrs. Shelley, helplessly, "did any- body ever see such headstrong people?" The next morning Charlie absented himself. At the expiratioh of two weeks he returned. He made no men- tion of his movements, and Edith made no comment on what she knew of them. The summer had ended, and they were on their way home. As the cars stopped, Charhe said to his sister: "This is Lorburg. There is no reason why we should hasten home, and I took this route that I might spend two days in this place. If you also remain, I will insure you pleasant accommodations. If you prefer going on, I will place you in charge of Mr. and Mrs. Betterton, and overtake you in Richmond, where they will stop for a few days. Decide quickly." "I do not choose to he under obligation to Mr. and Mrs. Betterton. Of course, I shall have to remain." She did so, but made their stay as unpleasant as possi- ble, never leaving her room at the hotel till the moment of their departure. Fortunately, Charlie's love affairs were progressing with a smoothness that would have re- compensed him for more than this. "Really," said she, "I anticipated an accession to our party. Is it possible that they have ideas of propriety, -these Lorburg people?" They were in the parlor of the hotel, waiting for a hack to take them to the depot. She was standing before a mirror, rearranging her bonnet-strings, and saw him, as, pale with anger, he walked up behind her. "Edith!"  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7897-00000141"/> "Well," carelessly smoothing a bow. He controlled himself, and waited calmly; but not till the carriage was announced did she turn fi'om the mir- ror or evince any consciousness of his vicinity. He de- tained her: "I am engaged to be married to Miss Lee. Were she to speak unkindly, or conduct herself super- ciliously toward you, I should resent it. I shall certainly do so if you continue to deport yourself in this manner toward her. I never liked Prank Muncair, yet I was never unkind or ungentlemanly enough to wound your feelings by a display of my own. For the future, I de- mand equal forbearance at your hands. Only, I promnlise you one thing, you shall never be brought into contact with my wife. You shall be taxed with no such acces- sion to any party of which you may be a member. Trust me for that i" "Why don't you all come on?" asked Harry. It was midwinter, about ten days after Katers mar- riage with Mr. Kemper. He had pushed aside his break- fast-plate, and now sat with feet extended under the table, his clasped hands supporting the back of his head. Kate busied herself mysteriously at the head of the table. Mrs. White sat in an easy-chair at a little distance, her feet on a cushion, the morning papers on her lap, her cat lapping milk from a saucer on the hearth. The very in- E carnation of content was Mrs. White, and so at tnis mo- ment she was thinking that she should be, having secured for a lifetime all the luxuries, without any of the cares or expenses, of a first-rate establishment. Happy woman I Plenty to eat, plentpy to drink, and no quarterly payments to make! '"When is Miss Edith to be married?', asked Mr. Kemper.   "In about two weeks," said his wife. "Ran up-stairs, Kate, and see if all my buttons are sewed on." She understood him, but though he spoke playfully, a cloud came over her face, and she left the room reluc- tantly. "Mrs. White, I have placed at your disposal six hundred dollars." "Oh, my precious Sammie I You overwhelm me with benefits!" She really had the audacity to call Mr. Kemper "Sam- mie," when his sponsors in baptismn ventured only on "Sam." He explained that she must not feel the obliga- tion so deeply, as it was only six hundred dollars a year in quarterly payments. Poor woman! so unconscious was she of her impending fate that a smile of amusement played on her lip as she said how little men knew what women required. Why, it was only yesterday that she had paid six hundred dollars for a lace shawl. Yes, Sammie quietly remarked, he had given Kate a check for the amount last night; but he would not advise Mrs. White to purchase another at the same price, as any future check should be of a different description. Literally and figuratively, her eyes began to open. Mentally she said, "Kate shall make it up;" aloud, "Well, Sammie dear, do not let me trespass too far on your generosity." Mr. Kemper drank a glass of water to conceal the smile that would play around his lips. Clearly, he had not yet taken his seat in the synagogue. "I have also engaged a room at a boarding-house, which I think you will like, as it is very quiet and re- tired, though, of course, you will use your own pleasure with reference to any change of that nature." 24*  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7897-00000142"/> aoEa      L L'FT TO HERSELF. "A boarding-house?"The tones were sepulchral, and came through ashen lips. "The room is yours from to-day. As soon as you shall have made the necessary arrangements I will send up a furniture wagon, etc." "A furniture wagon?" "You cannot suppose that I have been deceived by your recent affectation of friendship for me? And it is time now that we came to an understanding.  Your course has been sufficiently plain to me of late years. And now, mark me, if, after you leave this house, I finld my wife growing discontented or unhappy, if I find her becoming soured or suspicious,-if, to be at once brief and explicit, I detect any evidence of your handiwork,--I will convince you that my wife and your daughter are neither one nor indivisible. I will remove her from this place, and that day withdraw your allowance, taking care there. after that Kate shall neither supply you with luxuries nor the means to procure theml. Your boarding-house is on --- Street, No.-. I shall send up porters, furniture wagons, etc., not later than Friday. I mention this now that there mav be no necessity for renewing the subject, and take for granted that you will have more discretion than to discuss the matter with my wife. I have already informed her of my arrangements." "Why do you wish me out of the house?" she asked, with humility that would have been touching in any one else. Mr. Kemper rose from the table and selected a cigar from the stand on the mantel. "The fact is, my dear madam,"--Mr. Kemper paused to take a match,-" the fact is,' - then he lighted it,-"Kate and H-you do not ob- ject to smoke, I believe?" "Now, Sammie," she whimpered, her mouth a forlorn-   LEFT ITO HERSELF.       283 looking cr escent,--"now, Sammie, you know very well that I like a good cigar above all things." "I really was not aware of it; allow me to offer you one." "Oh, dear dear I what a funny creature you are l Always at some joke!" she said, with an hysterical giggle. "That is my character, no doubt," replied Sammie, who had never said a humorous thirg in his life. "Kate and I, madam, propose such domestic retirement that we hesi- tate to make you one of our household. We feel that we have no right to deprive society of the blessing which Heaven no doubt vouchsafed as a universal boon. Your example as a Christian!-dare we withhold it? Your fidelity as a mother Hshall we veil its beauty? Your sincerity as a friend!-shall I, who have tested its purity and know its value, shall I monopolize it? Nay, verily, though it made my life a joy forever." "I think it very mean and ungrateful in Kate to allow it," said Mrs. W. "Kate's attachment to you, madam, is no more to be compared with her love for me, than is the chirp of the grasshopper to the song of the nightingale; so what I do is right, as far as she is concerned; and as I think I shall be able to endure the faults you deplore in her, I hope we shall get on comfortably together, even with the loss of your good opinion. But, were it otherwise, Kate would find me a funnier creature than she probably re-  members her father to have been, since I shall certainly be master of my own establishment, Faith all respect due to the little woman as junior partner." "Yes, funny as you are, Kate will find it no joke being upder your thumb. I could have told her so when she married you."  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7897-00000143"/> 284      LEFT TO HERSELF. "Since you failed to mention it, madam, I fear it is true. Poor Kate I However, I am happy to know that you are not to suffer with her, and that it will depend upon yourself alone whether you witness her misfortune at any time. I am happy, also, to know that we resign you into careful and familiar hands." "Whose?"Her lips formed the syllable, but she was absolutely incapable of articulation. "Oh, there is a character not ' unknown to fame,' who, in common parlance, is said to ' take care of his own.' ' "You are no gentleman 1" Sammie laughed, with the cigar between his teeth. "Neither are you, Mrs. W., if recrimination is to be the order of the day." For the first time in her life Mrs. White was speech- less. After Mr. Kemper had left, she crept up to her room, and also, for perhaps the first time in her life, she had a genuine fainting-fit. "Edith Shelley had a hand in this. Don't I remember the night I saw them talking together at Mrs. Walton's? Didn't I see then that she was after no good? ,and wasn't he speaking of her just before le sent Kate off? Oh, if I could but pay her for it I If I could but hurt her! I would not care how much harm I did myself by it. 'Well, I'm certain of one thing,-it cannot do her any good to show those letters; and she doesn't want them seen, or she would not have tried to hide them with her dress that day when Kate and I went in. If she had not done that, I should never have thought about them. And didn't that lover of hers look as mad as a hornet when he heard me telling Mrs. Brown that Edith Shelley had been engaged to that fellow in Paris? Well, I'll make him look a good deal blacker than that; and if he will just look so at her, it's all I ask of him."   LEFT TO HERSELF.        285 She entered her new boarding-house on Friday morn- ing, and Frank received the letters on the afternoon of the same day. In the evening he went to see Edith. Finding other gentlemen present, he left them to sustain the conversa- tion, himself preeving a moody silence till their de- parture. He took 'seat beside her, and looked thought- fully into her face, feeling sorry for her,-somewhat re- morseful, too, truth to tell, yet full of indignation and contempt as he thought of the package he had that day received. So fair, so false I "You are a very beautiful woman, Edith," he at length said. She blushed with a deeper feeling than that of gratified vanity; and he continued, looking steadily at her. "I wish to ask you a question. Answer me truthfully." Unconscious of the temptation about to assail her, she asked, in reply,--  "Do you remember what was said by one of the most subtle and selfish of Europe's statesmen?-that prudence might sometimes demand silence; but that it was never permitted to a man of honor to tell an untruth. Being a woman, of course I shall not be silent; au reste--" "Au reste--I am glad to hear you quote him." He handed her the package. "These letters have been placed in my hands. 'They are addressed to another man. They are in the hand- writing of my future wife, and are signed with her name. I ask her permission to read theim." Lip and cheek and brow had all grown deadly pale ere her trembling fingers disclosed the signature. When she spoke, it was to ask for a glass of water. He went out into the hall for it, and during his absence she summoned all her energies to meet the crisis which she felt might be  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7897-00000144"/> 286       i ;U ^1-,    ,.. a terrible one for her. She was silent so long that he at length spoke,- "Does prudence demand this silence, Edith, even though you are a woman?" "Prudence would not demand it, Mr. Muncair, even were the letters genuine. Do you not see that they were written years  " "I await your permission to examine them. I have not yet done so." You declare not?" He paused, and turned impatiently away; then said, contemptuously, "I am not an Austrian prince; but even in the humble position I occupy, it is permitted me to be a man of honor." "Sit down, please." He did so, and, laying her hand lightly on his, she raised her eyes with a persuasive smile to his face, "Even should these prove to be what we call 'love-letters,' apparently they were written before I ever saw you. If I love you now, why care that I fancied another three years ago?" "Why, indeed? I am no such jealous fool, or I should have been the most unhappy man alive since the hour   r when you 'gave me your hand  And a kiss beside, And vowed you would ever be true;' for since that day you have been so nearly engaged that it amounted to the same thing, not less than twenty times. There's Morton  " "Oh, that was-- "Of course, only flirting; and so with the other nine- teen; and I have made up'my mind to that, because you can no more help flirting than I can help my beard grow-   ing or my tailor dunning me; but, in truth, Edith, lightly as I may regard or profess to regard that, there is one thing which would make me give up my sweetheart, and which would estrange me from my wife." She dared not provoke him to tell her what that was; but sat looking over the letters, though her head swam, and the lines seemed blurred, and she could not read a sentence. "It would be nothing," Frank continued, "that you were engaged to Labenstein: that you have seriously and repeatedly denied the fact to me, declaring him always to have been only the friend of your friend, that would be-everything." "If I had deceived you,"-and, despite all effort, her voice sank and faltered,-" if I had deceived you-would it not have been-was it-what made me do it ?" "God knows," said he, bitterly; "I do not." "Could it have been for anything but that I loved you ? Why else should I have cared for you to know? And could you not forgive a step, false though it was, which was taken only to be nearer you ?-only through deepest love for you ?" Touched by this new phase in Edith's character, and, of course, subdued by the tribute to himself, Frank sup- pressed the reply which had sprung to his lips, and merely exclaimed, though with more sentiment than feeling "Alas, for the castles that blow down in a year !" "Is your castle destroyed ?" she asked, sadly. " That remains to be seen, Edith. It was a fair estate. Dispatches have come which may tell of utter ruin. For the last time, I ask your permission to read them." " Will you not trust me when I tell you that I am just from your castle, and that n6 storm has visited it,-no cloud dimmed the landscape, or thunder muttered near ?"  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7897-00000145"/> 288       LEFT TO HERSELF. "Ah, Edith, I fear you speak of a castle of your own; for in the direction of mine clouds were surely gathering I Let me, then, have my dispatches." She was at an absolute loss what to say. She dared not let him see the letters; yet to withhold them was equivalent to confession. Only one path seemed open to her,-that of persistent denial. "Seriously, Edith, do you or do you not intend me to read those letters? If forgeries, I shall discover and punish the author as your enemy and my own. If genu- ine--" ' They are not." "Then they are mine. Give them to me." She did so. During the next twenty minutes the only sound that broke the stillness was the rattling of the paper as Frank read the letters and returned them to their envelopes. With what was to Edith maddening deliberation, he ex- amined the dates and post-marks; compared the forma- tion of characters; noted the different styles of paper, observing that no mistake had been made, such as using in July that which fashion had rendered admirable in December. He remarked that the most tender were the most crumpled; and, under other circumstances, could have smiled at the scent of tobacco which had, probably, bQen left by the count's moustache. "A clever forgery, indeed!" His measured tone gave no clue to his opinion, and Edith could have shrieked with agony and impatience, as, without raising his eyes, he went on reading. At length he did look up, and her heart almost ceased to beat as, replacing the letters on her lap, he said, coldly, "I am forced to believe, Miss Edith, that your claim on these letters is superior to miue."   LEFT TO H-ERSELF.       289 *               "Do you mean that I wrote them?" "I cannot doubt it. Your manner toward Labenstein confirms it. His conduct, and many speeches which I attributed to wine or insolence, go to prove it. Before I asked the question, if those were your letters, I read my answer in your face, for you recognized them instantly " "Have I not said I did not write them?" He was silent. Stung with mortification, keenly alive to the humilia- tion of her position, hopeless of vindication, she now sought no refuge save in the unreasoning passion of one conscious of being irretrievably in the wrong. She raised her eyes defiantly to his, though a hot flush suffused her face,-a scorching, burning blush of shame. "You translated my expression according to your own desire. No one else ever doubted my word; certainly no other gentleman ever so far forgot himself, or what was due to a lady, as to tell me that he did so." No word of answer. Frank was gazing thoughtfully on the floor. "You would have taken Florence Lockhbart's word 7I Without raising hiseyes, he answered, slowly, "Against this evidence? No." "But vou would have been amazed, of course, to find your saint so wicked?" "Miss Lockhart is in no degree responsible for or con- nected with: this unfortunate business, Miss Edith; why do you attack her T" "Why do you defend her? What is she to you?" "I do not defend her. There has been no need." "Oh, no; reputed saints may safely sin. She, I sup- pose, is above suspicion?" "' So, at any rate, I have always found her." "You are an enviable person," said she, " always to 25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7897-00000146"/> find people as you would have them. And pray," she continued, with dilated nostrils and flashing eyes, "had Saint Florence so far departed from her role as to do what all the rest of the world does,-deny an engage- ment,--what would it have been? Falsehood, or only the exquisite modesty of a Christian lady?" No answer. She almost stamped with jealous rage. At last he raised his eyes, and looked steadily but silently at her. "That woman," he said to himself,-" that woman my wife! She looks like a beautiful lioness." Beauty of dress and feature alone remained. The crimson tide of passion had swept away all sweetness of expression; the lightning flash of rage had left no ves- tige of womanly attraction. "Are you afraid even to suppose it of her? Do you ' hesitate even to imagine yourself pronouncing sentence on so lofty an angel?" "I should hope to be spared so embarrassing a posi- tion, Miss Edith," he said, courteously but significantly; "it would be more pleasant to the lady, and certainly less painful to myself, that sentence should be pronounced by her lips." A deadly pallor overspread her features; then she commanded herself sufficiently to say, "Do you mean the verdict of separation? and that I should be the one to pronounce it? Have you vanity sufficient to make that necessary? Incredible!" "Let us, at least, be friends." He held out his hand. "You and I? Friends?" She still attempted to speak haughtily, but her lip quivered, and her breath came short and quick. He did not love her; be had almost ceased to respect her; he would not marry her; but, if she softened and became   LEFT TO HERSELF.       291 again the tender, loving, beautiful woman she could be, Frank knew that for a time, at least, he should again be- come her professed lover. "Good-by, then." Edith turned silently away, and he left her, feeling little less miserable than if still engaged to her. Let us, too, close the door, and suffer the proud heart to drain unseen its draught of bitterness. She hardly heeded the outcry of her crushed affection. She was to have been married in two weeks, and pride was clamoring to know what the world would say. CHAPTER XXIV. ON the evening that had been appointed for his mar- riage, Frank went to see Florence; and had a denizen of the grave appeared, she could not have been greatly more astonished. "You do not know, then, that Miss Edith has dis- carded me?" "No," she answered, coldly. "Will you believe something that I assert upon my honor as a gentleman,--my integrity as a man?" "Certainly." "Then believe that your cousin discarded me without provocation; that I committed no sin, nor omitted anv attention, to produce this result. She rejected me as she has rejected all others who ceased to interest her, with no thought or care for the happiness of any one but herself. Fortunately, in this instance, the happiness of neither party was involved. In fact, I found that she had, for  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7897-00000147"/> 292    -  LEFT TO HERSELF. years, been engaged to the Count von Labenstein; and her discarding me was the reward of the discovery. She never loved me, of course. Now, you must listen to me patiently for a few moments. That letter which you saw -" "I did not read." '"No; that letter was written in a tone that no woman of the world could have misunderstood. Miss Edith would never have given it or its writer a second thought. You wronged me cruelly. I had not thought you capa- ble of a decision so unjust and--pardon me-so un- generous. And, ah, how I loved you I Florence I Flor- ence! you cannot have forgiven yourself I! I came home; was unoccupied and unhappy. Partly from pique, partly for want of something to do, partly, I verily believe, because it was the fashion, I addressed Miss Edith, without any definite wish regarding- the termination of my courtship. I must not tell how little I cared for her. I need not tell how unconquerable has been my love for you; you have too often felt indignant and offended at my involuntary evidence of it; but you can be so no longer. Now that I am free to tell you how constantly and truly I have loved you, despite your unkindness, despite your coldness, despite repulses that would have effaced your image from the heart of any other man, you cannot refuse to listen to me; you can- not be offended by my words; for, unless you deceived me once, you loved me; unless you made that letter the pretext for dissolving an engagement you never intended to fulfill, you cannot continue to resent a line of conduct which your own unkindness led me to pursue." Florence was but a woman, and she loved him. Even when a woman does not love, she looks very charitably on misconduct produced by a sense of her perfections.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        293 lie pressed his suit with warmth and energy; and again they were engaged. That point attained, he urged her to marry him at once. He should then have some incentive to useful- ness,-some motive for employment; he should no longer feel that he had only himself to live for; he should be a better citizen, a better friend, a better man, when one so dear to him would be influenced by the Position he held. Surely she had known him long enough and well enough to trust him, without the earnest of a more lengthened engagement. That piece of audacity should have been rewarded by the assertion that she had known him en- tirely too long and too well to do anything of' the kind; but make a woman the judge in a case of head vs. heart, and the plaintiff is sure to be nonsuited. Their marriage was fixed to take place within the three months following. It must be remembered that Florence was totally un- aware of Edith's sentiments toward Frank. Since his explanation, it had never once occurred to her that Edith cared more for him than for the others with whom she had amused herself. Her marriage would have been de- ferred had she for one moment suspected the rage and mortification which the anticipation of it awoke'in the breast of her cousin ; for she was too noble and too kind to parade her happiness before the eyes of one wrho had squandered all her own. We are told that Ismenias, the D'Orsay of ancient Corinth, commissioned a friend to buy a jewel for him. The friend succeeded in purchasing it, at a sum below its value. "Fool i"- said Ismenias, "you have disgraced the gem 1"So would the lustre of Flor- ence's happiness have been dimmed had she known it was purchased at another's loss. The first'intimation that Edith had of Frank's engage- 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7897-00000148"/> 294       LEFT TO HERSELF. ment was the casual mention in her presence of his ap- proaching marriage; but, great as was the shock, she retained sufficient self-possession to contribute her quota of conversation on the subject. A paler cheek, a more unhealthy brightness of the eye, were the only visible effects of the intelligence. Her father having been dead but a few months, Edith's marriage was to have been strictly private; so that few anticipated the occurrence, or could have told-she having been absent from the advent of summer-whether her engagement- was broken then or later ; but she did not reflect upon this. Alone, in her chamber, her sole thought was of the world's dread laugh; the world's extended finger; the world's assertion that she had been jilted. In an agony of mortification and despair, she threw herself, sobbing, on the floor. Day by day she became more wretched. Her lover was her own no longer. A cloud had rolled between leer brother and herself; soon it would be impenetrable. Among the people who called them- selves her friends, in every smile she suspected a sneer; in every tone a covert laugh; in every word a hidden sarcasm. She became morbidly suspicious; and, ever ready to resent, soon provoked sentiments that had not heretofore existed; so that in a few weeks she had re- pelled and offended almost all who had continued to visit her in the partial retirement of her present life. Charles had gone to New York on business connected with the settlement of his father's affairs, and Frank's marriage was but a week distant, when Mr. Day one evening called to see Edith. Among other things, he spoke of a series of concerts, just concluded. "I declare, I rarely hear a woman sing, Miss Edith, that I do not think of you. Why, the city is mad about Pasdini; yet, with the aids of a concert-room, you might   LEFTT TO HERSELF.       295 excel her, as Niagara excels your fountain. I wish 'you were my sister, the world should -be at your feet in less than a month; no name should be more widely known, no talent more highly applauded, no beauty more devoutly worshiped. It is deplorable that such a voice should find echo only within the walls of your parlor." "Do you really believe that I could win applause, such as I have never known before? Could I make a name to glory in?" "You could, indeed." She said to herself, in the reckless folly of her soul, "Well, what else have I to live for? I shall never be married. Shall I be a nonentity, when I have reigned a queen? I have often fancied myself a heroine on the world's stage: I will enact the part which hitherto I have only read of or imagined." She said aloud, "You are acquainted with the mlanager of these concerts, I think you said." "Yes ; Mr. Fry." "Make arrangements with him for me, then." "For what?" '"To sing,--to give concerts."' "You are jesting. Why, Charlie would shoot me like a dog." "Charlie acts without reference to my feelings; I owe no deference to his. Will you bring Mr. Fry-here to-morrow?" "Excuse me, Miss Edith ; but, really, I cannot do it; I cannot take the responsibility. Your brother would oppose it; you would regret it." Opposition rendered her firm; and, having convinced Mr. Day that she was in earnest, he' consented to bring Mr. Fry to see her. They came next morning, and she was affording a specimen of her vocal abilities, when Ed- ward Bertaord walked in. He was surprised, but asked  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7897-00000149"/> 293o .    LEFT TO HERSELF. no 'questions till Mr. Day and Mr. Fry had left. Her explanation was met by utter incredulity; but he soon became aware that she intended to verify her words; and then he exclaimed, angrily,- "Day is an idiot! He has done nothing all his life but hang around theatres ; he had better have made him- self respectable by carrying a hodt So Fry has persuaded you to give two concerts here before leaving for the North? Why? Because he knows that every man, woman, and child in New Orleans would go to hear you; and he knows, too, that though magnificent as that of an amateur, your voice is excelled by " i"You are mistaken!" she said, warmly; "I am a bet- ter judge of music than you are; so is Mr. Day; so is Mr. Fry; and I know it to be true, what they tell me,- that I can make a dazzling reputation." "And pray, what are your financial arranngements?" "iMr. Fry says I shall not be annoyed with business transactions. He will attend to all that. I do not care to make money." "Can't you see how Fry is humbugging you? Ha! no wonder he finds your voice so sweet, when you tell him such pleasant things! Acnd you have promised to sing on Thursday week? You really mean to do it?" "I really do." He talked himself hoarse, and Edith out of temper. He wrote to Charlie, telling him to come home without delay. Charhe had left New York for Lorburg, and never received the letter. Edward telegraphed three or four times; but there came no answer, except from Mr. Shelley's lawyer, who finally sent word that Charhe had left New York ten days before. Edward telegraphed to know where he had gone. No one knew. Wednesday morning arrived, and the following extract,   from one of the leading papers of New Orleans, will show to what extent the entreaties of Edward and the hys- terics of Mrs. Shelley had influenced Edith: "As will be seen by a glance at the advertising col- umns of to-day's paper, those who expect to attend Hall, to-morrow night, are promised a rich musical treat. We can ourselves testify to the excellence of most of the performers selected by Mr. Fry, who, in this matter, generally beats everybody else; but, in the selection of his new prima donna, we hear that he has actually beaten- himself. Many of the cognoscenti, and many who are not of the cognoscenti, have been permitted to judge of her performance; and those who have listened with ears scientific, and those who have listened with the soul, concur in pronouncing it inimitable. But the best is yet to be told. It is among the on dits that the lady is a daughter of New Orleans, and one of our reigning beau- ties,-one of the fairest, wittiest, wealthiest, and a mem- ber of one of the oldest families of Virginia. What the causes are that have induced the faire ladye to adopt the histrionic profession, we have as yet been unable to ascer- tain. We need not bespeak for her a full attendance. There has been an unprecedented rush for tickets of ad- mission, and a crowded house is inevitable." Once more, late on Wednesday, Edward urged her to resign her intention,-even at the eleventh hour. He promised to appease the rage of the disappointed man- ager, to contradict the reports of the newspapers, and to do all in his power to dissipate the effects of her visionary scheme. It was of no avail against the stubborn will that was hers by inheritance. She seldom answered him duringthis interview; she hardly seemed to hear him; one thought filled her heart almost to burstingr: "Frank will  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7897-00000150"/> 298      LEFT TO HERSELF. be married to-night. Her triumph will be complete when she knows that he made me discard him 1" After Edward's departure, Edith left the parlor for her own room, and mechanically locked the door. For New Orleans, it was excessively cold; but, stunned by the vehemence of her emotions, a deeper chill came over her as she whispered to herself, "Doomed I doomed!"Ay, doomed by the evil passions instilled by an atheist father, and cherished by a proud and wicked heart. Under the pressure of this terrible doom, that existed only in her own imagination, her pride gave way; the pale lips quiv- ered; the cold, glistening eyves were deluged with tears. Her better angel in that moment guided the tossed and wandering bark of Edith Shelley's soul toward a safe and welcoming haven; but bitter memories came thronging around her, and with them came the thought of revenge ; pride and passion resumed their place at the helm, and steered for the vast maelstrom of eternal ruin. Even her memories were not so bitter as her reflections. She had loved, and loved in vain; and, bitter though that potion, she could have drained the cup had not the world's scorn mingled with the draught. But her ill-starred love was known to others,-had become the idle talk of every gos- sip and scandal-monger in the city. She, the proud and haughty Edith, was now the laughing-stock of the very fops and silly misses whom she had despised and ridi- culed I She fancied she could hear the laugh, the jeer, the mockery of the polite and elegant circle of fashion- able idiots, as the assertion passed from tattling mouth to shallow brain, "The jilt has been jilted at last l" And Frank Muncair's wife would know it,-would know that Edith Shelley had vainly loved her husband. How Florence would triumph I This it was that lashed her soul into a fury verging on insanity; and how vain, how   LEFT TO HERSELF.       299 needless, how untrue the thought I Society knew nothing of her disappointed love; or if, through Mrs. White, it had been informed, cared so little about it as hardly to deem it worthy of a jest. But what intellect is there so bright that passion will not dim? What sense so strong that wounded pride cannot weaken? What heart so pure that jealousy will not inflame and utterly pervert? As Edith pictured Florence the wife of the only man she herself had ever loved, she rose from her chair, and commenced a rapid and restless walking up and down the room, her steps keeping time with the angry current that raged in every vein. The coldness, the chill, the physi- cal weakness had passed away. Reaction had taken place; fever had set in. Pride, the anger and the strength of pride, once more reigned supreme. Stopping in her walk, she threw aside the window-curtains and raised the sash. The winter wind poured coldly in, but could not cool her fevered brow. The curtains flapped shiveringly by her side, and strange phantom-shapes were- shadowed on the wall; but none so weird and frightful as the dread figures pictured in-the panorama of death that moved its ghastly length along the chambers of her soul; fixing her eye in inward vision, and dimming every outward object, however strange and grotesque I "Carriages are rolling to the door; the wedding-guests assemble; the bride is blushing beneath her veil; the bridegroom joyously awaits her coming.  Love will watch over her tenderly; love will adorn her pathway; love will illume her life, and fill up its measure of joy. "( And this should have been mine. What has become my aim?-to win homage, such as an opera-singer can win; to live in the feverish atmosphere of the stage, amid the glare and glitter of sham magnificence!

And he will take his bride to witness this my life. He will wrap her up tenderly, lest the winds of heaven visit her too roughly; he will seat himself beside her; he will purchase with gold the right to flaunt their insolent joy in my face; or, should she not care to go, he, too, will remain, to while away her moments, without one thought or care for me, who loved him with a love she cannot know. It shall not be P" Lost in fierce thought, she stood beside the window. When she turned away, she gazed vacantly about the room, in search of something, she scarce knew what. Her mind seemed absent,-far away upon some evil er- rand,-and would not readily return. A long-drawn. sigh, a present light in her eyes; and she went quickly into the adjoining room. She had too often had use for various costumes to be now at a loss for a disguise; and when she returned to her chamber, no one would have recognized Edith Shelley in the old woman who entered the apartment. "I require and charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know any impediment why you may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well as- sured, that if any persons are joined together otherwise than as God's word doth allow, their marriage is not lawful."                 . During the pause that followed, a pang shot through Frank's heart. He had once, at a wedding which he and Edith attended together, told her that whenever she came to be married, she would have to bribe the clergyman to   LEFT TO HERSELF.        301 omit that portion of the service, else her betrayed swains would rush forward in a body and barricade the path to the altar with a mass of blighted hopes, crushed hearts, and false promises,-to look upon which would make " an owl weep, a cat wring her hands, and a nightingale sob outright." In that brief but momentous silence he re- called her happy, mocking laugh as she proudly replied that the arm she would cling to must be strong enough to push aside the counterfeits that passed for hearts; the heart she would rely upon must be valiant enough to breast every barrier, and true enough to compensate for the-loss of all the rest. Conscience smote him as he re- called the poor counterfeit he had palmed upon the proud yet trusting girl, -a sham heart, filled with the deadly poison of deceit. What was it that whispered in the secret recesses of his better nature that the counterfeit heart had carried with it sickness and death to Edith's soul? Was it that awful thing which men call premo- nition? Congratulations were tendered, kisses showered on the bride, and the usual platitudes--by courtesy, witticisms- were laughed at with a well-bred grace. Flirtations were progressing in corners and on tete-a-tetes; young men and maidens pelted the hours, as they flew, with flowers of speech and smiles, or nettles and burs of sarcasm. None noticed the old woman who looked in through a window, from which the curtain was half withdrawn. She seemed to avoid attracting attention, for when she left the place her step was light and quiet. She stood in the servants' hall. "Will you," said she, in a voice that trembled with age or agitation,-" will you ask Mr. Muncair to step here for one moment? I have known him long, and would speak with himl,-to congratulate him." 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7897-00000152"/> "I ain't no fool, to be a-goin' a interruptin' of Mr. Mun- cair now 1"And the servant passed on with his tray of ices. Many more rebuffs of this kind were met with before she succeeded in her purpose. This, however, was never shaken by the rudeness of the servants, who, like all menials upon such occasions, were inordinately im- pressed with the dignity of their position. But, at length, a timely douceur slipped into a dusky palm effected what persuasion and entreaty could not. The servant went in search of Mr. Muncair. "Tell him," she said, " that an old woman  one whom he has befriended- wishes to speak with him; she will not detain him long." Frank was surprised, but too happy, just then, to re- fuse any one anything. He transferred to another gen- tleman the lady on his arm, and went into the servants' hall. The old woman already stood without the door, but desired him to go with her some distance farther into the yard, - she had to communicate important news, which none must hear. Greatly wondering what this news might be, Frank accompanied the feeble old creat- ure, as, with infirm and tottering steps, she made her way into the deep shadow of an English linden. She stopped; and, grasping his right arm with her left hand, -that was a vicelike clasp for aged fingers, firm as the hold of death,--said, "I have wished for this moment!" She made a slight movement with her right hand, and seemed to scan his person as narrowly as the lack of light would permit. "Now," she continued, "I will let you know my errand!"And a dagger was plunged to its hilt in the bosom of the bridegroom. No thought of danger had crossed his mind; and in his impatience to be rid of her, he had obeyed her every movement. With a groan he pressed his hand to the" wound in his breast and sank to the ground. Edith   looked toward the house, but no one was near. The sound of a mellow voice, with instrumental accompani- ment, floated to her ear; two or three servants were eat- ing and drinking in the kitchen; a pair of lovers slowly paced the portico, arm in arm. With what insane clear- ness she marked every minute incident, as she stood be- side the prostrate form of him she had loved so well and hated so fiercely I The proud heart beat calmly, now that it was avenged. No troubled pulsations dimmed her bright eye, or dulled her acute and listening ear. A moan of pain escaped the wounded man. Edith pushed the mask from her face and bent over him. "Moan on ; I remember the time when a moan from you would have'wrung my soul with pain. Your groans are music. now; so will be the cries of your bride of an hour. Look on this picture; I gave it to you long ago; and this tress of hair,-it is mine." She bent closer over him. His eyes, still open, were fixed upon her; but the little strength remaining to him seemed rapidly ebbing away. "Listen," she continued, in a voice hoarse and quick with rage that feared it might be baffled, "'here is what I have 'written, in a hand so like your own that your wife will never see the difference: 'I loved you when I married your cousin; I wore your image on my heart while I placed the marriage-ring - on her finger. Adieu, you who should have been my own.' Yes, I will dabble my fingers in blood to place it on your heart, where your wire may find it after you are-dead." His eyes closed, his head fell heavily back, and the leaden hue of death seemed stealing over his face. As. she saw all this with eyes now practiced to the dark, a horrible sense of fear crept over her,-an appalling sense of fear, that fettered her limbs and chilled her blood, and chained her to the spot. Hark I Her heart stood still.    &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7897-00000153"/> Was that a whisper? The rustling leaves replied. What does the stillness mean? Is all earth listening? Are the stars watching? What muffled sound was that? Her heart-beats alone made answer. Never daring to take her eyes from the inanimate form before her, she retreated slowly from its awful presence; then turned and fled,- in thought pursued by a thousand feet, recalled by a thousand voices, assailed by a thousand hands; fled, like the wind, down the square, through the streets; up to her silent chamber. Oh, night of horror! night of fear I Each sound awoke some startling dread; each hush was ominous of ill. She feared to cast, her eyes around; she feared the spot she could not see; she feared to break the silence; she feared the silence that-she would not break ; she feared to be alone; she feared all other presence. Fear I fear I fear  She pictured herself the inmate of a prison ; the scoffed and jeered at of a mob; the condemned of a jury; the victim of a scaffold. And who would pity her in her agony of helplessness? Where was Charlie? She did not know. Where was Edward Bertnord? But Frank was his best friend. Where was God?   Alas, she did 'not ask.  She had courted no human sympathy, had sought no aid from divine mercy, and was now left to herself. How can we describe the consternation of the guests; the anguish of the bride; the sorrow of her father? Soon the parlors were tenantless; the gay song was heard no longer; and lovers' vows were no mote whispered on the portico. Through the long night and day Frank lay motionless, but not unconscious, while Florence sat be- side him, speechless as himself, but pleading wildly in her heart to the God she loved for the life that was dearer   - , Y'i'l' T'u nKaK'INL.   305 than her own. His life! his life I All she could ask, or Heaven bestow,-his life I The newspapers were filled with sensation paragraphs concerning the event. All pronounced recovery hopeless; and mysterious hints were given that a clue to the mur- derer had been found. Late on Thursday evening, the wounded man called, faintly, to-his wife, who, repressing her joyful agitation, answered him gently and calmly. A pause, then a faint whisper, "What day is this?" "Thllrsday." "Who is in the room?" "Only you and myself. Father has just gone out with Dr. Carson. Do you want anything?" "I have not been asleep. If I get well, I will try to be a good man. If I do not,-my darling, it is God's will." t"It is best not to talk yet, Frank; wait till to-morrow God will spare your life." He murniured, "My life, --worthless to me; worse than worthless to others. Florence, darling, if I die, be kind to Edith Shelley; teach her to be good." She thought his mind wandering, and made no answer, listen- ing anxiously for her father. "You will not? Forgive her, Florence ; she was never taught what was right." "Yes, Frank, I forgive her; I will be kind to her." "If I live, we will both be kind to her. She shall be our sister." "Yes, yes. Hush now, while I bathe your head for you.                   , "She thought I had treated her badly; but I don't think she really meant to kill me."' Florence started. "She put her picture in my vest-pocket. If I die, you 26*  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7897-00000154"/> 306      LEFT TO HERSELF. must not care for that. You know I love you. Hand me my vest, please." "Frank, you must wait. You are not strong enough for this." "Hand it to me, darling, or look yourself in the watch- pocket, and give me the little parcel you will find." Florence read what Edith had written. A few words of explanation from Frank, and the whole tragedy was before her. "As soon as I get well, we will go to see her, Flor- ence, and make her our friend, will we not?" "No, Frank, you must go alone. I would not go with you to see her. Were she dead, I would not go with you to take flowers to her grave." "Oh, Florence! So bitter?" "No, Frank; but it would seem like a triumph for me. She would not like us to be there together." Sadly and silently they dwelt upon the exquisite face that smiled up at them from the ivory; for one brief mo- ment a lock of hair twined caressingly around his finger, then fell unnoticed to the floor. During that silence Frank Muncair determined on a noble future, which God, in his goodness, permitted him to realize. It was about two hours before that appointed for the concert, when Edith directed her maid to ascertain from the servants at Mr. Lockhart's whether Frank was still alive, charging her not to be seen by the family, or to mention her mistress's name. She dared not pursue what would have been the safest course. It was the second time that day that Eliza had been sent on the same er- rand; and the large sum that Edith had on each occasion given her, produced a desire to return with information   LEFT TO IIERSELF.       307 of corresponding value. With what seems a universal propensity for relating anything calculated to awaken feelings of horror or painful astonishment, Eliza hastened home, bearing the announcement that Mr. Muncair could not live through the night; that the servant who had called him from the parlor had been taken into custody; and that Mr. Lockhart had said, if Frank rallied a mo- ment before he died, he should give some clue to the murderer, so they could put a rope around his neck I Edith shuddered, but had no time for thought. The hour for departure had arrived, and Edward Bertnord awaited her in the parlor. How gladly, oh, how gladly would she now have renounced her foolish whim! But she dared not. "Miss Shelley," said Mr. Fry, " you will assuredly do yourself justice to-night. The house is crowded,- crammed with the elite of the city. Allow me to con- gratulate you, as well as myself. Gentlemen," he con- tinued, turning to Edward Bertnord and Mr. Day, "I will venture to say that you have never seen a house at once so crowded and so select."  With a sinking heart, but with a proud and calm bear- ing, Edith advanced and curtsied to the audience. She saw, in every part of the house, the faces of acquaint- ances, friends, lovers. Her cheek crimsoned, as she felt the fire of their searching and inquisitive looks; but she did not lose her self-possession. She returned look for look,--calmly, coldly; permitting her eyes to range pas- sively over the entire house. Many sought to catch some furtive sign of recognition ; none succeeded. She seemed scarcely conscious of their presence; and as, by the aid of her wonderful voice, she poured forth her whole pas- sionate heart, the brilliant scene faded from her view. In the boundless theatre of her lost soul, she sang the swan  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7897-00000155"/> 308       LEFT TO HERScELF. song to Destiny. There was a tragic force and pathos in her every intonation which entranced the audience, and was held in painful remembrance by many who really liked her. While the last sweet note lingered in the charmed air,- there was breathless silence throughout the crowded hall; eager ears were loth to lose a single vibration. Un- bounded applause followed the momentary silence. Bou- quets, wreaths, flowers of every hue, arranged in every conceivable form, were showered at the feet of the suc- cessful debutante. Edith heeded them not. She had, indeed, commnenced successfully; but sud- denly, as she reappeared for a second song, the blood forsook her face, a deadly dizziness seized her, the ball became dark before her e-yes; and, had she not sup- ported herself by the piano, she must have fallen. Standing near the door of the hall she had recognized a man whom Frank had once pointed out to her as chief of the detective police. The pianist, observing her ex- treme agitation, prolonged the prelude as much as pos- sible, kindly affording her time to recover herself. -At length he asked, in a low tone, "Will you not try it now?"And, bowing assent, she commenced; but her singing was false and feeble; she was scarcely conscious of what she was doing; her voice seemed to die in her throat, a"d she could not exert herself to throw off the weight that oppressed her. During an interval between the songs, Edith pressed her hand to her brow, and listened to the applause that called for her reappearance. The audience made every allowance for embarrassment, and wished to encourage her. She turned to Mr. Fry: "Despite the kind encourage- ment of the audience, I am well aware that my perform-   LEFT TO HERSELF.        309 ance to-night has proved a failure. I must request you to make my excuses. I am not well enough to re- appear." Mr. Fry would have objected; but, recalling what he knew of the peculiarities of his prima donna, remember- ing, also, that the continuance of their engagement was an advantage to himself alone, he thought better of it, and acquiesced as graciously as might be. Edith said to Mr. Bertnord,- "Do not let him tell them till I have gone." Mr. Fry thanked the ladies and gentlemen for their polite attention; excused Edith on the plea of sudden illness, and hoped his "kind friends" would be present on the following evening, when she would give her second and last concert in New Orleans. The light of a street-lamp suddenly flashed upon Edith's features, exhibiting their deadly pallor, as she leaned back in the carriage. Edward thought she had fainted. "Miss Edith, what can I do for you?" "Nothing, nothing," answered Edith; "you cannot remove the shame of to-night's failure; you cannot hush the laugh, nor smother the sneer of the fools who wit- nessed it. No, no; you can do nothing for me." "Miss Edith, believe me, that no triumph of song could have repaid me for seeing Cbarlie's sister stand, unembarrassed, before the audience assembled to-night. Your failure as an artist was your triumph as a woman." Her voice trembled as she answered, "I thank you, Mr. Bertnord; you have been very, very kind to me, and--" "Tut I not a bit of it. What do you thank me for? I never gave you anything; no, not so much as a piece of advice, unless in regard to the style of dressing your  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7897-00000156"/> 310      LEFT TO IERSELF.- hair, or some such matter, which advice, if I remember rightly, you invariably rejected." As the carriage stopped, she asked what man that was standing under the lamp-post. "Only a policeman," said Edward. Springing hastily out, she ran up the steps. Inside the door, she stopped, and held out her hand, as if loth to have him leave her. Sweet and infinitely sad her voice lingered on the words, "Good-night." It troubled him; it pained him. He could not bear to leave her. He had gone two squares, when it occurred to him that he would advise Mrs. Shelley to remain with Edith during the night, and endeavor to arouse her from the lethargy of melancholy into which she seemed to have fallen. It was a slight hope of relief, but preferable to none, and at once he retraced his steps. Edith sat cowering in her chamber, assured that she was watched. She almost screamed with terror at the motion of a curtain, and was palsied by the whispering of the wind. She had torn to shreds her disguise of the previous night, and now stood with the poniard in her hand. Where or how to conceal it she could not tell. A man's step on the portico; the ringing of the door- bell; the approach of many feet; the whispering of many voices,--what does it mean? One terrified glance re- vealed the crowd that had gathered beneath her window. Her heart quailed in helplessness and despair. One look of utter agony; one step, as if for flight; one pause of ,sickening dread; one quick gasp of horror, and-the dag- ger, beautiful as it was, found a sheath of workmanship more exquisite than itself. Edward and Mrs. Shelley stood talking in the hall.   LEFT TO HERSELF.        3" Serenaders filled the air with incense soft and sweet. Edith lay dying in her chamber. The mellow notes floated up to ears that were grow- ing dull. The pulses of that proud heart could never again be quickened,-exulting in applause. That white hand would never again toss flowers from lattice height. Cold now, and still, the fingers clasped a jeweled blade. The garnets were like bleeding hearts; the emerald ser- pent was a type of jealousy; its diamond eyes glittered with the light of hate. THE END.   &#xD;</p>
