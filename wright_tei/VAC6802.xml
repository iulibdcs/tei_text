MANY narratives of our early history which are par- ticularly designed for novices are read as tasks, laid  aside with a sense of weariness, and their statistical details soon forgotten. I venture an experiment, endeavoring to give to the past the aspect and hue of Life, to excite a personal interest in events which would secure little or none' as unclothed facts. For this purpose, something of fancy has been necessaily admitted, but all idea of fiction is seriously disclaimed. Any one familiar with the annals of youthful Virginia will here recog- nize, it is believed, a scrupulous regard to historic truth. A volume designed for popular reading need not be encumbered with references. They might have been given profusely, but will'be found only where some statement in the text has seemed particularly to require them. The authorities upon which I have relied, and to    <pb n="iv-v (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6802-00000003"/> iV       ADVERTISEMENT. which I have carefully adhered, are Hillard, Simms, Smith, Stith, Beverly, Btirk, Keith, Campbell, Force's collection of. historical papers, and two or three traetis, old ad rare, which are noted in the course of the volu'e. For the generous loan of these, I am in- debed to the Libraries of Harvard, Yale, and. Am- herst Colleges, and to that of the Boston Athenmum. More modern writers have also been consulted; and I have only to regret that others have not been at my command. These statements are due to the form in xyhich the following narrative is cast; a form which I may ap- ply to the early history of our other Colonies, should circumstances permit.  S. H. APRIL, 1856.

THE BATTLE-FIELD. "GOD is great! Extolled be the perfction of Him who changeth others, but is not changed!" Such were the words of Mustapha Bey, as he wiped is dripping blade upon the mane of his charger. "Thou sayest well, my lord,"' replied Belgogi, a Tartar chief, who bore marks of desperate firght. Praise be to God, who hath enabled us to tri- umph!" "There i no strength nor power but in God, the High, the 'Great! But may the victories like this which He grants to the faithful be few!" And there was heavy gloom upon his brow as Mustapha sur- veyed the battle-field. Thirty thousand men lay there, weltering in blood; more than twenty thousand followers of El Islam, and nearly ten thousand who had' fought under the ban- ner of the cross.' The dying shriek of the war-horse, and the dying groan, imprecatioh, or prayer of the mangled soldier, were making terrific discord there, a    <pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6802-00000006"/> 2    THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. the sun -was sinking to his rest. Such was the scene   n in the valley of Veristhorne, on the 18th of November, in the year of our Lord 1602.  At sunrise, forty thousand Turks and Tartars had intercepted the re- treat of eleven thousand veteran warriors of'the Ger- man Emperor Rodolph II., under the Earl of Mel- dritch, in the narrow and rugged pass where tilhe mountain of Rotterton, in the province of Wallachia, , abuts pn the river Altus. The gallant band of Chris- tians, cut off from all possibility of retreat, had dis- covered their condition without dismay, and prepared to die as soldiers should die. At high noon, they had received and repulsed the headlong charge of Mus- tapha Bey. Belgogi, with his wild squadrons, had come to the rescue.  Legion had followed legion, each fresh and each fierce. Until nearly sunset, the Christians had stood firam, dealing dreadful but un- availing havoc upon their fierce assailants. Their gen- , eral, hopeless of all else, had then concentrated the remnant of his little army, and heroically headed them in the desperate attempt to' cut their way through the dense masses before them. With a handful of sur- vivors, he had already reached the banks of' the Altus. '"By Allah!" exclaimed Belgogi, " the Nazarenes take to the river! The dogs.! they would rather drown than bleed! May Azraeel gather them under his wing! ':  Mustapha and'his xtaTf looked on in breathless si- lence. The fugitives were plunging into the stream, and in a few moments they were beyond the reach of Moslem sword or spear.

Save a few who were. floating, helpless and dying, upon the current, all the rest of his eleven thousand braves were strewn on the field of strife. 'With the plunge of the last Christiarn into the waters, all sound of conflict ceased. The victors stood gazing with admiration, and even with a chivalric satisfaction, upon this last and stuccessful struggle of their foes. Among the group which we have designated, Mus- tapha brolke the silence. "God, the all-seeing and all-knowing, who hath appointed a cause for every event, hath decreed their escape.  The will of the Compassionate, the Merci- ful, is good." Then, turning  to one of his aids: "Let the signal of recall be .given, and the field searched for the living.  The sword of the believer a    ' is the liey of heaven and of hell." With this significant license for the slaughter of the disabled Christians, the general and his staiT de- parted.  The slain and wiounded lay literally in heaps; for regiment after regiment had grappled over thll bodies of the fallen,: and added their own to the ghllast- ly pile.  The field was now rapidly searched in every direction by detached parties, who dragged forth the: , dying from  the dead, bearing away their fellows, but for the most part despatching the Christians with l;he dagger.  Those only were spared whose  .appearance gave promise of a large ransom. As the two   victorious generals, with their attendl- ants, were leisurely pursuing the hoof of Belgogi's steed struck upon a prostrate cavalier, who writhed convulsively under the blow, uttered a m <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6802-00000007"/> 4    THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION, mentary cry of pain, and sank again upon his bloody bed. The Tartar, with a hissing curse, aimed a pass- ing blow at "the Christian dog?" and pursued his way. The movement and the outcry of the wounded man attracted the attention of a rambling party, who in- stantly advanced, but found, him relapsed into insen- , sibility. His war-horse lay lifeless, and in his fall had pinned to the ground his rider, who still, all uncon- scious as he was, retained a rigid grasp upon his sword. '"It was the dog's last howl. The soul of the Giaour has gone to its doom," said one of the par- ty-as he spurned the body. By Allah!" exclaimed a comrade, " he has left us a goodly spoil. This belt, this cimeter,--three hun-. dred ducats could not buy the like. Jewels too! said he, removing a diamond locket and brooch, while the other wrenched away the splendid sword of the soldier, and a third raised the body to secure its gor- geous belt. A deep groan arrested the plunderers, one of whom instantly drew his dagger, exclaiming, To thy place, thou accursed!"        4 "By the beard of the Prophet, hold! - thou shalt not," shouted he who supported the knight, and par- rying the stroke. of his companion.

It is the will of Allah that we sell the dog, and who shall resist that which is appointed?

"The lion, and the bear, and the Philistine thought David was a man of valor." "And a stripling," retorted Ali. * Mohammedans acknowledge, as " the uncreated word of God, re- vealed to hisprophets," the five books of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospels of Jesus Christ; but these they consider greatly cor- rupted. The Koran they regard as in an uncorrupted and incorruptible state, as surpassing in excellence .all preceding revelations, and as hav- ing abrogated them.

But now the efforts of his captors were becoming so rapidly effectual, that conversation ceased, and the whole attention of the soldiers was given to the sufferer. At length he became able to aid in his own removal, and was taken to a rude shel- ter hurriedly constructed for the wounded. When found by his captors, the titde of life had almost ebbed from the veins of the fallen youth; for the rush of battle had been terrific over him, and hIany a blow   THE 3BATTLE-FIELD.       7 had he received from sword-and spear, and ironed hoof, as he lay there pinioned, but fighting to the last.

The expression of his eye, in par- ticular, was anything but imperious or defiant; yet; its most transient glance disclosed an inward nobleness, and power of purpose, which even the haughtiest Tu!rk felt and acknowledged. He was now ready for mar- ket, and was transported, with some scores of his fellow-prisoners, to Axiopolis, or Rassovat, in the neighboring province of Bulgaria. Here he was sold,. as his captors had anticipated, for a high price, and became the chattel personal of the Bashaw Bogall.    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6802-00000009"/> / CHAPTE R    I1. THE INDIGNANT MAIDEN. CHARArZA TRAGABIGZANDA, a budding   Turkish maiden, was reclining upon the divan of her apart- ment in Constantinople. She had just completed her morning toilet, and had abandoned herself to the luxu- rious repose in which the Muslinr-eh of the higher class pass much of their time. She was surrounded by all the: legant appurtenances of Oriental wealth. A beautiful lute lay at her feet; the cushions upon which she reposed wre of the most costly stuffs; birds of rare plumage were singing in their gilded cages; the morning air, laden with the fragrance of i flowers, was gushing freely through the lattice; while a small fountain threw up its jet of sparkling water from the centre of the ' durkla'ah," or depressed por- tion of the room. The maiden turned hier eyes lan- guidly around, and breathed a light sigh expressive of dissatisfaction Her rich drapery, her sparkling jew- els, and all tl. ,td rnmnents of her apartment, had evi- dently failed tc .ive her pleasure. This was natural; for there is an instinctive and immortal craving in every human soul which no form of luxury or beauty can satisfy, -- never, perhaps, more distinctly felt or emphatically confessed than when the heart has just come to scorn the toys of childhood, and to feel the opening aspirations of its    THE INDIGNANT MAIDEN.        9 immortal nature.  Theh a chance hour of idleness or lassitude reveals that self is not enough for self, and -that "the elements of the world are beggarly'   in comparison to the want within.  "A solemn murmur in the soul Tells of the world to' be; As travellers hear the billows ioll Before they reach the sea." It was this sensation of unsatisfied immortality which made the maiden sigh. "Fatima!" she suddenly exclaimed, "thy lute! Strike one of the happy airs of thy country." A beautiful Abyssinian slave,* who stood at the opposite end of the "aa'h' or saloon, her arms meek- ly folded upon her bosom, promptly answered the command of her mistress.   But in vainl.  The fair maiden soon tired, and, with something like petu- lance, reproached her attendant for want of'skill. O my mistress!" humbly replied the girl, ' would 'that I h6d' sklill! Command thy slave to something which shall make thine heart light.  Shall I send for a reciter of romances?" "Nay, girl: neither tales nor music suit me.  Am I not peevish, my faithful one?" caressing her. "Mtle- thinks the fault is here," laying her hand upon her  ]heart. "And yet what sorrow have I? what want;? Allah preserve me!" "May the Compassionate help thee!" devoruutly ejaculated the slave. 'The slaves usually called Abyssinians, although from the territories of the Gallas, appear to have been a mixed race between negroces and whites. Many of the females among them were very beautiful.

For a whij the mistress relapsed into silence, gazing at the play of the fountain with a listlessness which pained the devoted and Nvatchful Fatima, who was glad when they were interrupted by the entrance of a eunuch of the household.

It was certainly with apathy that the fair lady received and held negligently a missiv evhich she well knew abounded with protestations of love and adoration. " What Allah hath decreed must be fulfilled, she murmured.  "Heigho! Girl, this Bashaw talls of love. Think you he knows what it is?  "How could he fail to know-wivho is espoused to so much loveliness?" ' Loveliness, forsooth'! He hath not seen me. For aught he knows, I may be as ugly as Iblees." "The beauty of the Houris its known on earth, yet no man living hath seen them. So are the charms of my mistress known. Birds of the air have reported A them.  And many are they who sigh to possess them." "Silly girl! What saith the Prophet of those who flatter with their lips? This Bashaw would be my lord and master, and I suppose is appointed unto me by Heaven. But as for love,-fie, girl! Here, cut this silk."

The Bashaw Bogall hath proved himself a warrior, of wlich I had not dreained. He hath sent me a gift won in battle, a useful gift, --a gift that hath life. Now, I suppose, I must love and adore."'

The girl obeyed, and the roguish, arch look of her mistress dispelled her fear and checked her emotion. "It would have broken my heart," she murmured. ? "Listen, child!

After a brief silence, she addressed him. But he could only reply by a courteous bow, and by a sign denoting his ignorance of her language. Perceiving this, she cut jshort the interview, by bidding the attend- ing eunuchs to remove him, and to find some one in the household or neighborhood who could communi- cate with him, and who should instruct him in the Turkish tongue. "And let him be informed immediately," she add- ed, " that it will be his duty to. be in waiting .in the anteroom of my apartment, to answer my call, and to perform all the services of my page."

John Smith! she miscalls you Joseph;. then be a Joseph." 4 Young as he was, he had great knowledge of the world, and, rare sagacity  in detecting  character. Without the vanity to suppose the lady enamored of himself, he perceived that a mere novice mniht easily excite her to love. He resolved, therefore, to    8 guard his own honor and conscience by a scrupulous deference, which should serve as a safeguard of her peace.  Yet bondage was terribly chafing to one who had hitherto been as fiee as the winds of heaven; and he hoped so far to excite the lady's compassion as to effect his deliverance. The lady Tragcabigzanda, on her part, was only interested in her slate as any maiden, just conscious of needing some unknown good, would have been in a youth of his person and manners. Thus her inward disconteit, and her new  and fluttering interest, led her, as already remarked, to be constantly demand- ing his presence and conversation. She also indulged a natural curiosity to know his history. "'Yoo-seef!" said she, as he was one day in at- tendance in her secluded garden, " thou wast of rank in the army?? x It should be borne'in mind that the young Joseph is the traditional Apollo, or model of masculine beauty, with the Moslems.

' As thou hopest for Paradise, as thou believest in him of Nazareth, this is true?" "As I so hope, and so believe, it is."

All this was be- trayed to thne watchful scrutiny of her female attend- ant, by the compressed lip, the dilated eye, the firm and haughty step with which her mistress traversed and retraversed her hall.

"Our forces were increased by nine thousand men, under Prince Moyses, who took the chief command. The city was accessible only on one side, through ravines narrow, steep, and dangerous. Consequently our approaches with artillery were step by step, and every step in blood. After we had gained the table- land of the mountain, our enemies laughed us to scorn for what they called our sluggishness, for even then it was nearly a month before we could complete our trenches and plant our batteries. They told us that we were too lazy; that we were growing fat for want of work, and their ladies weary for lack of some knightly amusement. For their sakes- the Turkish ladies' -the Lord Turbashaw proposed to meet any captain of the Christian army in single combat, the W 2 .

By this time our mettle was well up, and so many claimed the honor t;hat no elec- tion could be made but by lot. It fell upon one of some prowess, but no distinction. Great preparations were made, and a truce agreed upon for the occasion. At the time appointed., the Lord Turbashaw entered' the lists clad in splendid armor, brilliant with gold and jewels, and attended by three Janizaries. The Christian soon appeared, simply clad, followek by a single page, who bore his lance. The: ramparts were thronged with ladies and armed men, and the Chris- tians were drawn out in their most imposing battle- k array. The combatants passedl each other, midway of  the lists,) ith courteous salute, and assumed their proper stations. There was a moment'st breathless silence. The trumpet sounded. The knights met atl full speed. The Lord Turbasha w fell from his horse, his brain pierced by the Christian's spear; who, un.. harmed, and finding his adversaiy lifeless, appropriat-.. ed his head and his rich accoutrements, and returned the body to the city." And Grualgo?

The challenge could not be refused. The meeting was attended with the same pomp and anxious suspense as the former. At the first onset, their lances were shivered by the shock. The Turk was nearly unhorsed, but the Christian sat firm in the                .    .    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6802-00000022"/> 34   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. saddle. They then had recourse to tleir fire-arms.. The Christian was slightly wounded, the Turk not scathed. At the second shot his bridle-arm was shat- tered, his horse became unmanageable, himself thrown upon the ground, when his forfeited head, his horse and armor, were secured as the trophies; but the body, with its rich apparel, neither of which 'was forfeited, were sent back to the city." "A fair combat and a gallant one. The third?" "The Christian might have been content, lady, had he not been a hot-headed fellow and puffed up by success. But he must tempt fortune needlessly. So, obtaining leave from his general, he sent a message into the city, saying that he feared the ladies had not had amusqment enough, and that he should be happy to furnish more, provided any one could be found who dared meet him in the lists. He would stake the heads which he had won, and his own, on the issue. Bonny Mulgro, a stout knight, accepted the challenge, but prudently declined, as he. had the right to do, the lance; and selected the pistol, the battle-axe, and the sword. In the use of thl formidable battle-axe he was particularly skilled. They met accordingly. The pistols were harmless. Then came the battle-axe, to which the Christian was but little accustomed. A tremendous blow disarmed him of his axe, and nearly felled him from his horse. A shout from the walls roused the half-stunned man, so that he recovered hirn- self in time to evade, by dexterous management of a well-trained steed, the furious blows of his adversary. He now drew his sword, and, by God's assistance, ran it through the body of the Turk. Thus ended the tragedy of which your ladyship inquired. It was enough for all parties." k.

We defeated the Turkish army of forty thousand men, and the province came under the rule of the Emperor. They again made head in Moldavia. Meldritch, misinformed of their num- bers, advanced with but thirteen thousand men to fight forty-five thousand. By a new and frightful kind of i wild-fire, which-- laugh as you will, lady- I invent- ed, we scared the Turks and reduced their numbers by five thousand, without loss to ourselves; retreat- ing, as soon as we discovered the strength of the ene- my, to gain the fortified city of Rotterton, within three leagues of which is the field on which I was left for dead." "Give me the particulars. I know nothing of them, except that the Lord Bashaw of Bulgaria was a hero there." Smith related the details of the slaughter, the issue of which was sketched at the opening of our narra- ) tive. The conversation which we have given above was not continuous, but had been resumed from time to time as opportunity was contrived by the lady, whose romantic interest increased with every day's recital, and with her own observation of her captive's court- ly phrase and noble deportment. It is perhaps need- less to state, that the grace and manliness of his per- son, his frankness, modesty, and high-mindedness, had completely taken captive the heart of a secluded, un- sophisticated )maiden, just waked to a sense of an unknown watt, and just stung by the wanton mean- ness of a soulless wooer. Smith could not shut his eyes to the ftct; neither, withi all his regard for her happiness, could he shut his eyes to his only hope of freedom.   THE YOUNG ADVENTURER.      37 But these conversations did not' end here. The enamored maiden demanded their repetition,.- the minute filling up of the outline, -the answering of a thousand questions. In short, she made her captive the theme of all their interviews, the hero of every scene which she led him to describe. Yet she was timid and cautious; at an early stage " feigning sick- ness when she sought the society of h]er slave, thcat she might discard other company." A las, poor Fla- ti ma! There was a jealous and watchful mother on the premises, who knew full well the danger of proximity and fiee conversation between a simple maiden and a -fascinating youth, even if he were a slave and tan infidel. The lady Tragabigzanda perceived that she was spied, and took the alarm. For a while she would heroically suspend their intimacy; then, rest- less and suffering, she would again command his presence. At length, the swelling tide of her passion surmounted even the barrier of virgin bashfulness. Her confession was not made in words at first, but in tears. Smith could not but pity her, whom he really esteemed, and might have loved had she been Chris- tian and English-born. He was grateful for her kind- ness; blamed, and yet justified himself in his heart; and replied to her sobs with words of real respect and tenderness, showing, but with a gentlemnanly delicacy, that he fndersthod her emotions. At length she raised her- lead, and repeated, in a tone of touching simplici- ty and confidence, an extempore version, in Italian, o: an Arabic song. "I wished for my beloved -; but when } beheld him. I was confounded, and possessed neither tongue nor '*  -  ,  4    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6802-00000024"/> 38   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. eye. I hung down my head in honor and reverence; and would have hidden what 1 felt, but it would not be concealed." The English soldier was touched to the very soul by an avowal, so delicate yet ingenuous, of a pure and trustful love,-by an apology so true to nature for her want of self-control. He could not conceal his emotion 'alth ugh he could give no passionate re- sponse t ers; for he ]new the insurmountable bar- riers of rei, country, and education.

Nay, leave ]me!' and, clapping her hands, there was no alternative, as Fatima instantly answered the summons.  "Thy slave is at thy feet,' said the affectionate girl. "Fatima! thou lovest thy mistress?" caressing her gently. The slave raised her lustrous eyes with a wonder- ing, mournful expression. ' I know it, child; I know it.

The affectionate Fatima --weeping because her mistress wept --strove with all the arts of tenderness to soothe her. But the lady seemed even unconscious of her presence, and utterly abandoned to sufiering. After an hour of convulsive emption, she sprang suddenly to her feet, fixed her eys wildly upon the frightened slave, and said, with a grave but frenzied utterance: - "If Beauty should approach to be compared with him, she would hang down her head in shame.

Timour, the Bashaw of Nalbritz, was enjoying his afternoon repose in his " mandar'ah, or room of re- ception, when Ibn Ali and Smith presented them- selves before him. The latter wore a Turkish cos- tume of respectable materials, and bore no insignia of servitude. His person and address, as already signi- fied, were those of a gentleman deserving of consid- eration. The lady Tragabigzanda, my lord," said the slave, according to his instructions, " hath sent me to con- duct to thy presence this honorable traveller. She adds her greetings and love." So saying, he retired. The Bashaw, a man of prepossessing appearance, received his guest with the indolent but stately cour- tesy so peculiar to the Turk, and motioned. him, with the usual salutation, to a seat upon the divan. Smith returned his salutation as well as he. was able, for he had striven diligently during his captivity to acquire the Turkish language. Water, coffee, and the chibook were introduced, ac- cording, to Turkish custom. These preliminary rites of 'hospitality concluded, conversation was tolerably sustained. Smith had already produced the letter of the lady Charatza, which was retained unopened by the ceremonious Turk. After the expiration of an hour or more, during unto him, at the sight of him they cut their hands, and praised God, ejaculating these words: "This is not a mortal," &amp;c. -Koran, ch. xii. v. 31.   SELF-EMANCIPATION.      45 which the host had taken an opportunity to read his sister's letter, he proposed, with a shade more than his previous gravity, that his guest should accompany him to hisi plantation, where business required his presence. Always ready for active motion, Smith gladly acquiesced; and they were soon galloping over the ground, attended by half a score of asned slaves. After riding about a league, they arrived at a farm- house, at which they alighted. Scarcely had our young officer touched foot upon the ground, when. ble was suddenly pinioned and disarmed. Turning in amazement, to ask explanation, he found the cour- teous Turk transformed into a Fury; his eyes glared with rage ; his whole countenance expressed intense passion; and, with violent gestures, he vociferated alternately to his prisoner and his slaves.. Such was his volubility, thtat Smith could distinguish but few words, - ' Christian dog!" "Carrion-vulture nate the dove!" and like phrases. But lie plainly heard, for the Bashlaw then spoke withl ominous deliberationl "By Allah! yes; I'll teach thee the Turkish tongue and Turkish manners, too, son of perdition!" Smith had no opportunity to re-monstrate, nor power to resist. Exhausted by his fuiry, the tyrant entered the house, when Smith was instartly stripped, and reclad with a shirt of hair-cloth, over which were drawn garments of undressed skins. His head and face were then shaved " so bare as my hand," to quote his own words; an iron collar was riveted upon his neck; and he was sent to the tasks 'of hard labor in the field. He was a mafn of nerve and sound sense; he therefore yielded at; once, and without despair, to his hard and sudden fate. But his thoiughts flew to    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6802-00000028"/> "   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Constantinople; to his gentle captivity there; and to his lovely, noble-minded mistress. Not for a mo- ment, however, did he indulge the suspicion that she might be privy to his wrong, Until the Bashaw had read his sister's letter, he had not dreamed that Smith was her slave. But, in all guileless simplicity and sisterly trust, she had revealed that she was the mistress of his person, and even that he was the master of her heart. These disclosures respecting a detestable Christian, too -were more than enough to overcome that very pliant and vapory virtue called brotherly sympathy or affection. His rage was terrific; how it was cooled, the sequel will show. He returned to his home without again vexing his soul by a sight of his victim. It is not necessary to journalize the bitter allotments of our hero; a few facts are sufficient. He was but one among hundreds of slaves, and, being the last- comer, was the slave of his predecessorss; yet, to quote him again, "there was no great choice, for the. best was so bad that a dog could hardly have lived to endure."' But John Smith was not the man to sink amid billows. For a time he anticipated that the lady Charat  ight dissolve his bonds. But the conviction wa soon frced upon him, that the malice of his tyrant had effectuy prevented her interference. Finding that somne of his ellow-slaves were Chris- tians, he urged them to concert measures for freedom; but their spirits had been hopylessly broken. In bitter- ness and abjectness of sor, they only longed for the last, the fatal drop in the cup of their misery. No taunts, insults, or cruelties could glut the malice. of the Bashaw. With his own tongue, and hands,   .              .c   SELF-EMANCIPATION.      47 and feet, with whip and cudgel, he belabored the young officer whenever he found himn at his tasks, Smith bore all with magnanimity, and with as much show of heroism as he could; for the tyrant was al- ways well armed and accompanied.  But there is a point beyond which the' best protected tyrant is unsafe; a last drop which makes the cup of endur- ance overflow; a last pound which breaks the camel's back. Smith had not bated a particle of his soldierly dar- ing; it was only held in masterly check by his good sense. He could endure in passive silence, when his judgment told him that resistance or resentment wouldl be unavailing or worse. He now waited his time. It came. Upon a certain day, his tormentor was indulg- ing in his usual cruelties, in a remote threshing-floor vlhere Smith was at work. It was his last hour of grace. The young soldier's blood was up. Like the Hebrew deliverer, "he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man," he felled the brute with his flail, dashed out his brains, and hid him in the straw. Quickly clothing himself in the rich garments of the Turk, and securing in a bag a quantity of grain, he leaped upon the tyrant's horse, and dashed away at random. But the iron ring upon his neck was a badge fatal to his escape if observed. It was his fitrt necessity, therefore, to shun every one. Three days lie strag- gled without a clew to his proper course, - startled by every sound or sight which to his apprehensive mind betokened the approach of a human being. 1He had begun to despair, when suddenly he found him- self on a way-side before a Christian cross,--the mute    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6802-00000029"/> 48    THE YOUTH OF THE bLD DOMNION. but inspiring emblem of "deliverance to the captives." To him it was doubly an object of joy;-as a reli-  ions monument it quickened his drooping confidence in God, and it was a sure guide to a city of refuge. It was a mark, common in that part of the world, to indicate the route to a Christian country.  Smith knew this, and of course how to direct his course. At the end of sixteen days he arrived safely at Ecopolist a garrison of the Russians on the river Don.  Here his badge of slavery was a passport to protection, hospitality, and every lavish charity which Christians on the frontier, and themselves constantly exposed to captivity, could bestow. To use 'his own words, "lie thought himself new risen from death," so kindly was he treated. Under an escort, he took his way to Transylvania, where he "was glutted with content and neere drowned with joy," in the welcome and embraces of Meldritch and his surviving compan- ions in arms, by whom more than a year he had been numbered with the dead.   This Was in December, 1603.  Here Prince Sigismund confirmed by a di- ploma, dated December 9th, the title of nobility which he had 'previously conferred upon him, and gave him a purse of fifteen hundred ducats to repair his losses.' From these kindest of friends he tore himself away, only for his longing " to see and rejoyce himselfe (after all these encounters) in his own sweete coun- trye." ' Simms, 86.

ON the 26th day of April, 1607, three vessels bear- ing the flag of England- the largest not exceeding I6  one hundred tons burden- were making their way into the capacious mouth of the 'Mother of iWaters," the Chesapeale. They had just weathered, under i    bare poles, a violent gale from the south : and though ,i they now carried light sail, th6y yet labored in a sea fretting in resentment of the storm. At daylight, the southern headland of the bay, Cape Henry, had ap- peared in sight; so named by those on board, in honor of the Prince of Wales. A magnificent forest enwrapped the virgin bosom of the country, veiling her charms in a boundless mantle of verdure. With its alternate elevations    'and depressions, it seemed like a vast sea of foliage, but without. wrath and without fluctuation. Every- thing within the circuit of the landscape was placid and teeming beneath the vernal sun, and seemled waiting to welcome the strangers with anthems of praise to God. Yet there were lurking foes there, in the dark and silent thicket. The seeds of transgres. sion, and the consequent edict of the Almighty, had reached this seeming Paradise long before, and a new generation of woes lay enwombed there, ripe for the birth. The new-comers, reclless as most of them "                   .      <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6802-00000030"/> 50   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. were of God's glory in the works of his hands, gazed with silent and subnlred admiration upon such en- chanting beauty and voiceless grandeur. More than twenty years before (1584-), this yet undefined Vir- ginia had been discovered and skirted by British ships, and settlements had been attempted,; but none now approaching its shores had beheld them before. Their anchors were soon dropped within the cape, and a boat was sent ashore with thirty men. A hand- ful of skulking natives attacked them,- an omen of the future,-but were easily put to flight by fire-arms. On the other hand, Nature gave them a welcome full of promise. As she had just arrayed herself in her best robes, and put on her floral adornments, she received 'them with smiles in her groves of goodly cedar and cypress. She wooed them with her fra- grant odors and freshest flowers. She guided them to a secluded glade, - a little banquet-room, carpeted with living green, dappled and scented with straw- berries four times larger than they had ever seen. And then she led them to her clear, shallow streams, with their bottoms paved with oysters, and showed them the pearls which she had shaped and treasured there. One of the party was George Percy, brother of the Earl of Northumberland, who has left us an account of this reception. There was Bartholomew Gosnold, too, the projector of the present enterprise, and who five years before had explored the coast from Mas- sachusetts Bay to Martha's Vineyard. Christopher Newport, to whom had been intrusted the commaid of the little squadron, was also of the party. They returned on board elated by what they had seen. In the evening Captain Newport assembled the   THE PIONEERS.       61 principal men of the expedition in the cabin of his vessel. A small'sealed casket lay upon the table be- fore him, evidently an object of special interest to all present. He addressed them in lsubstance as fol- lows: - ' Gentlemen, we have reasonto congratulate our- selves that we did not yield to the despondency of a few days since, and shape our course back to Eng- land, After a voyage of more than eighteen weeks, although we have failed to find the island of Roanoke, we have every prospect of effecting a speedy and pros- perous settlement. The time has now come, desig- nated by his Majesty for opening the royal instruc- tions, and ascertaining the names of those in whom our colonial government is vested.." With much solemnity the seal of the. casket was broken, and it was found that the Council to whoml the government was intrusted were Edward 'Maria Wingfield, Bartholomew Gosnold, John Smith, Chris- topher' Newport, John Radcliffe, John Martin, and George Kendall. There was a man on board in confinement apd bonds. He had been kept so during thirteen weelks. This was Captain John Smith, who, after parting from. his friends in Transylvania, and sharing in a protracted and desperate sea-fight, had arrived in England in 1604, formed an intimacy with Gosnold, a kindred spirit, and embarked with him and one hundred and three others to plant an English settle- ment in the very uncertain territory then called 'ir- ginia.* On the voyage dissensions and jealousies had * These emigrants went out under "The London Company," an as- r?

Most of the adventurers were men of desperate fortunes and petty ambition.   The superiority of Smith as a man of energy and daring was not only a matter of fame, but was unequivocally indicated in his person.     Prob- ably jealousy  of his ability  had  rendered  him  ob- noxious to the more aspiring     and  conceited amongl the colonists;  for his high   reputation  and  frank, manly bearing   had  made  hin a favorite with   the majority.  Be this as it may, but about five weeks of their voyage, by the old route of the Canaries and West Indies, had elapsed, when he was put in con- finement on the absurd charge of having arranged a sociation chartered by the king, and having no other aim than mercan- tile profit. The charter gave to the Company exclusive right to occupy, plant, and trade between the tiry-fourth and thirty-eighth parallels of north latitude. The general control of their affairs was in the hands of a Superior Council in England, members of the Company, but appointed and re- movable by the king. The internal administration of the colony was in a Colonial Council, resident there, but to be elected or removed, by the king, and at. all times and in all respects to be thlemselves governed as the royal caprice might dictate. Thely were to elect. from their own number their Presi- dent or chief magistrate, and migllt delposQ him, and also fill their own vacancies. They might make any laws not touching life or limb,'and, upon conviction by jury, might pniish certain specified crimes by death. The .crown was to receive certain proportions of all gold, silver, and copper which the country might yield. Thus the emigrants themselves- while in the colony - had no voice or influence in the government. They were merely the machinery of the Company, dependent upon its providence and pleasure, and open to its oppression. The m:gnificent whim of concealing in a sealed box the name of the Colonial Council until the expedition should arrive in Virginia left the emigrants, in the interim, Without an authorized head. Hence, natu- rally,.their dissensions on the voyage.   THE PIONEERS.       53 cs conspiracy "to murder the Council, usurp the gov- ernment, and make himself king of Virginia." In this condition he had continued up to the present time. Seventeen days were now occupied in exploring the neighborhood, during which time tlhey received welcome and bounteous hospitalities from two small tribes of the natives, and smoked the pipe of peace r   with their chiefs. At length, having ascended the I;'  river Powhattan, -by them named James 'River, - -they selected the site of their residence on its north side, and 'about fifty miles from its mouth. It was on the 13th of May thatthey first "lifted up axes upon the thick trees," and called their embryo city Jamestown, in honor of their monarch. The suffrages of the Council were now given for their President, and Wingfield was elected. Smith was excluded from their body, on the ground of the charges already mentioned. But as every strong arm was needed to prosecute indispensable labor, he was released from his bonds. With true magnanimity, he entered into the spirit of the enterprise, and shared its toils, proudly silent about his wrongs. (I The colonists, for the most part, were little adapted to the arduous work of pioneer settlers of a wilder- ness.. Out of one hundred and five - their whole    number - there were only twelve laborers and a few mechanics. The. rest were styled " gentlemen," i. e. men unaccustomed to labor, "of dissolute habits,5' adventurers, hoping for some chance to repair wasted fortunes, and " some few of the greatest ranke little better than atheists." Notwithstanding, the beauti- ful peninsula --an island at high tide -which they 5* s1 ..,'        ' -     <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6802-00000032"/> 54    THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. had chosen for their home was for the present a scene of bustling activity. The sound of the axe, the ham- mer, and the saw, the falling of trees, and the shouts of excited men, broke up the old silence of nature; and the sun looked boldly down upon a soil hitherto veiled in shadows.  Tents and cabins were erected; apparatus for snaring fish and game was constructed; spots were laid out for gardens; clapboards were wrought for the lading of the vessels; and a fort was planned.   But Wvingfield forbade the erection of defensive works, other than a barrier of boughs,-- fit fuel for an Indian firebrand. When these prepara- tory works had tolerably advanced, Captain, Newport, Captain Smith, and twenty others, were ordered to explore thel river above.* About one hundred miles above the seedling city was an elevated opening in the forest, with the river- about half a mile in width-flowing at its base on the south.  To this point the tide brought up the waters of thp sea. Above, for the distance of six rliles, the river was a succession of rapids or cascades; and in front of the unwooded spot which we have designated, it was studded with luxuriant islands.    Upon the rear margin of this natural glade, and half shaded by the forest, stood a dozen native huts at irregular intervals. One of these, somewhat distinguished by ' The London Company ordered the colonists to seek a passage through the interior to the South Seas, i. e. the East Indies. They were to do this by exploring every considerable stream flowing from the west or northwest. A. roguish Indian in 1586 had told the English wondrous tales of gold at the head-waters of the Roanokc River, and that its source was so near the western ocean that the salt water would sometimes dash over into the clear fountains of the stream. These fables still influenced the London Company..   1i.^          'lTHE PIONEERS.      55 its form and materials, was the dwelling of the Indian chief Powhattan. H[e was lord of all the country be- tween this river, including its southern branches, and the Potomac, and from the sea to the falls of the principal rivers. Of some of the tribes within this circuit he was chief by birth ; of others, by conquest. Over all of therm- some thirty in number - he rnain- tained absolute authority. His regality, rough-]lewn as it was, was substantial; and his nobility, though not blazoned on parchment, was real, because intel- lectual. He had achieved dominion over other.-minds which had been born to rule; and. he still held it, a chief of chiefs, by means of his natural greatness. Powhattan was pacing the turf before the entrance of his lodge, absorbed in thought. Nothing in his personal equipment indicated warlike intentions; yet "his noiseless tread, his deliberate movement, and, occasionally, a listening attitude, betrayed that he was on the alert. He seemed to be alone; but there were keen eyes and strong arms at hand, jealous for his safety. He knew that white men had entered his domain and were hewing down his forest. His sa- gacity and jealously were roused; and, as he thought of the futire, he frowned. 'While listening to the sound of the Rapids, his eye was occasionally di- rected, with a look of expectation, along the stream -below. Suddenly, he stopped, the snapping of a twig in the forest caught, his ear, and the next instant a young Indian bounded across the glade and stood, panting and silent, before him. Without changing his posture or aspect, the chief quietlyr demanded:' "' Has the Young Deer snuffed the scent of the pan- ther?" <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6802-00000033"/> 56   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. "The canoe of the white man rests upon the bank. He is coming through the forest to do reverence to iowhattan." A grim, sarcastic movement flitted upon the fea- tures of the chief as he replied: "' It is well; we will receiye him.' He had hardly spoken when there glided from among the trees, and from various directions, one swarthy form after another, until no less than forty armed and stalwart warriors, roused by the footstep of the runner, were ranged beside their prince; while others stood aloof, partly concealed in the edge of the forest. The first were his body-guard, always in attendance; the others his more humble subjects. In a short time Newport and Smith came in sight, preceded by an Indian guide, and attended by a dozen of their own men well armed. It was the sixth day of their excursion. Powhattan advanced a few steps upon the greensward, and awaited in silent dignity their approach. Whatever may have been his sensa- tions and misgivings as he saw the glittering weapons and strange array of his visitors, it was with no small admiration that they beheld this primitive lord of the soil. Tall, muscular, erect, of a stern countenance, his eye %rilliant and piercing, his straight black hair slightly frosted by the winters of sixty years, and his frame of faultless proportions, he stood before them almost in a state of nature, but with a majestic and haughty port which showed them at a glance that he was born to be obeyed. He received his visitors with dignified courtesy and kindness, conducted them to his dwelling, and per- formed all the ceremonials of hospitality with princely   THE' PIONEERS.       57 grace and cordiality. Signs were necessarily substi- tuted for words; yet that both visit and reception were in token of friendship and respect, was suffi- ciently understood. The monarch of the woods spread before his guests a bounteous repast of hom- iny, game, fish, strawherries, mulberries, &amp;c.; and the pipe of peace was smoked. The strangers distributed little bells, beads, pins, and other trinkets, which were valued by the grave warriors above price. Captain Newport presented a hatchet to Powhattan, which he gratefully accepted, instantly comprehending its prac- tical value. The interview was necessarily short, and was terminated with every sign of mutual deference and good-will.  In natural genius, in far-sighted penetration, and in all the characteristics of an untutored warrior, Pow- hattan strongly resem bled the unfortunate Caonabo, the Hispaniolan prince, the captive of Columbus. Like him, he foresaw evil to his people from the coming of the strangers, and knew that it'must be crushed in the bud if at all; but, unlike him, he saw that in such an enterprise he could not hope to suc- ceed by bold and open contest, and from the first he adopted the policy of craft and hypocrisy, He there- fore disguised his real enmity, and even to his own warriors, who murmiurred at the intrusion of the strangers, he coolly said, "They want btt a little land."  ' A very friendly set, after all," said Newport, when they had at length arrived within twenty miles of Jamestown.  ' Civil, hospitable, kind,. from the .first day to this; from Jamestown to the falls; from strip- ling to king.

"Very friendly and'very infernal," replied Smith coolly. ".Ha! what do you mean? for there was more. significance in Smith's tone than in his words. "I did lut echo your own words, Captain New- port." "True; but - but have you seen anything amiss? Captain Smith, you have been among devils before, and know something of their ways. Have you seen anything suspicious?" ' "Enough, all along our route, and enough but just now."'  "What?"  "Straws." "Straws -" ' Trifles show the wind, Captain Newport."  The commander manifested some chagrin at. Smith's wident reserve, though he forbore further questioning. 7 He had never lost the terrific impression made upon  his mind, when, about thirty miles above Jamestown, ;hey had suddenly found " all the woods round about illed with begrimmed savages shouting, yelling, and  -rying .as so many spirits in hell could not have  [ showed more terrible.' Though they had offered no larm, and though the conduct of all with whom the ravellers had come in contact had exceeded in kind- less, yet the remembrance of the first alarm clung to Newport like his shadow. Smith, perceiving that he was growing uncomforta- dly nervous, soon said to him aside: "' Captain New- port, I have no disposition to conceal from you what   THE PIONEERS.    '    59 I mean; but it would be unwise to disturb our men. I think we had better hasten to Jamestown. The Indians are not as :friendly as they seem.' "But I ask again, what have you seen?" "Wherever we have landed, through all their feast- ing and merry-making, they lave watched us with less of curiosity than of jealousy and hatred. Tall fellows, with sharp eyes and scowling brows, have held sly conference about us in the bushes, and have sent off runners at various points, while others have been entertaining us. Powhattan's attendants bear us malice; and in the chief himself I could detect signs of a feeling no better. He thinks he has duped us, and means to play his game until we English are all off our guard, and he can. strike to purpose. Thus I read him and his people." "But what did you see at his dwelling?" "Men's faces, Captain Newport, that is all. But in men's faces; are words. They can be seen and read; but he who reads cannot repeat them in any language under heaven." "I confess I saw none of these things." Nothing when we set'up the cross?  "Nothing." "Captain Newport, I have great reverence for the cross; not because it is a cross, but because it tells me of the One Crucified and his redemption. In the wilderness especially, it is a very dear object to me, for it once. raised me from despair and guided me to deliverance in the steppes of Tartary. But I do not like to see it here.

"And therefore regard it with suspicion, Captain Newport. ][ saw many evil looks when it was raised, and am much mistaken if the fact was not reported to Powhattan within half an hour, and with very bad comments." "You spoke of hastening our return. Do you expect an attack?" "It is not improbable; yet arrows are playthings against corselets and fire-arms. That something is in the wind,. I am confident. I fear for our friends at Jamestown." "But they have armor and arms as well as we." "Where? In the men's hands? By their sides? No; in the custody of our President, for reasons of his own." After musing a while, Newport exclaimed: "So be it; for home then, and at once"; and their boat did not touch the shore until at the settlement. Smith's sagacity was not at fault. On his arrival he found seventeen of the colonists in the hands of the surgeons, and one of the two lads who belonged to the expedition in his grave. They had been at- tacked by stealth, when dispersed, unsuspicious, and without arms, by apparently four hundred Indians. The issue would doubtless have been the destruction of the whole, had not a shot from one of the vessels crashing through the trees so frightened the savages that they fled.            4 The President's eyes were opened. The projected fort was now properly constructed, and furnished with cannon, arms were put into the hands of the men, and regular military exercises were established. It was well. The savages, finding that the thunderbolts of   THE PIONEERS.       61 the whites did not follow them, soon resumed their attacks. "Wearisome days and nights were now' ap- pointed unto" the colonists. No one dared to stray beyond the protection of the garrison. They wrought at their labor with a guard. They slept uneasily, although surrounded by sentries. "I stand upon my rights as an Englishman, and demand a trial." Such were the words of Smith as he stood before the Council, and was told by the President to return to England with, Newport, and receive judgment from the Superior Council, to whom his case would, be referred. ( Wingfield was disconcerted by the demand, but replied, with tolerable composure: 1' We would spare you the risk, Captain Smith." "Spare -me! From what risk? I ask no favor, sir." "From the risk of blasting your reputation and forfeiting your life." "My reputation is in the keeping of mine integrity, and my life is nothing without both.

Wingfield, himself a wealthy merchant, who had 6 <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6802-00000036"/> 62   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. joined the expedition from the most sordid motives, replied sharply, "We shall act our own pleasure in your case, Captain Smith"'; and Instantly adjourned the Council. He had been Smith's first and chief accuser, and had reasons of his own for preventing an open trial.  The proposition of the President was soon known to all the colonists, and produced no small comrno- tion. His honest zeal in their enterprise, the proud equanimity with which he had borne confinement,  the noble spirit with which he had labored since his release, as well as the knowledge of his previous history, had secured to Smith not only the respect, but the admiration, and even affection, of nearly all the colonists. He now used no arts to excite their sympathy, but contented himself with simply saying,  I have demanded a trial."  "The fellow is insolent and dangerous," said Wingfield at the re-assembling of the Council. "A trial makes it possible that he may remain, in which case he will prove a sorry mischief-maker. In Eng- land he would be out of the way." "Let him have a fair and open trial," said Gosnold. "It is his right. For myself, I differ from our Presi-  dent; my convictions force me to. The man is hon- orable. Conspiracy is beneath him. If he would do   i mischief, he would do it openly, boldly; not like a creeping savage, or a snake in the grass. Sift his case by a fair trial. He will stand the test." The President moved nervously in his chair, and called for Newport's opinion. I cannot see sufficient' reason for disliling his presence here. He seems single-eyed to the good of  , I{   T:E PIONEERS.       63 the colony, and is brave enough to be of service. I favor his demand."' "O, send. him ofj, send him off," drawled John Radcliffe. "He makes trouble, and perhaps means tq be king after all." Martin and Kendall alluded to the nmurmurings of the people, and with much force, urging that to refuse a trial, and to a man so popular, might lead to- incon- ceivable embarrassments. Wingfield was constrained to yield, though with an ill grace. The trial took place. Upon thorough in- vestigation, it appeared that those who had before testified that Smith purposed to usurp kingly power by means of assassination, had been instigated to do so, and that their instigators had been actuated by pure malice. In the end Smith was acquitted; the tables were turned; and Wingfield, as the prime mover of the libel, was adjudged to pay two hundred pounds to the man whom he had wantonly wronged! Smith was now restored to his seat in the Council, and generously threw the effects of Wingfield, which were awarded him, into the common treasury. Thus did the schemes of an "unscrupulous and narrow- minded" men recoil upon himself.* On the following day peace was made with the Indians, at their own solicitation; and' on the 15th of 'June, Captain Newport sailed for England, leaving one hundred colonists in possession of stores and a pinnace, and with a prospect of prosperity and tran- quillity. * Smith, 43.

THE scorching rays of a July sun beat with full power upon the little clearing at Jamestown. The  noise of labor had ceased, and the hum of voices; in short, every sound of life. The pinnace lay moored  to the trees, and rocking lazily and untended on the  water. The tents were rotten and tattered. The cabins were tottering and half unroofed. The gardens were choked with weeds, and the ramparts of the fort  were deserted. A row of mounds in a distant corner, freshly turned up and covered with turf, had the ap- V pearance of newly made graves.  There were but two signs of life in the open space, --a carrion crow upon a tall pine, and an emaciated man sitting languidly upon the ground. They were   : eying each other! The pine swayed and creaked; the bird took wing and croaked.  "Your throat is an open sepulchre!" exclaimed the man, with some energy. Curse the bird!"And   i he clenched his bony hand, and ground his teeth, and  cursed Virginia, and cursed the. day of his birth, and j cursed God. It was dreadful, with death at his elbow, as it were! Suddenly another mood came over him. The lines of passion faded from his face, a thoughtful, pensive shade settled upon his pale ,  .     .     .,   THE BRUISED REED.      65 brow, tears stood in his eyes, he reached forward as if he would embrace something which he loved. " England! happy England!  Great God, if I could go home to die! It is a wicked son; yet, for one more prayer, mother! one blessing, one kiss, I'd be glad to die., But--dying like a dog --here- here.- O God! O God!?' The wretched man gave way to sobs. It was a little past noon. He had tottered a few steps from his miserable shelter, bending under the weight of a musket and a little, half-filled bag,---a burden which a hale child might have carried,--- but had stopped to rest on his journey of twenty yards. His object was to reach a large iron kettle suspend- ed beneath an awning upon a framework of poles, and over some smouldering embers. He now dashed away his tears, as if angry with himself, took up his burden, and nerved himself to his task. Having quickened the fire, he emptied the bag into the cal- dron, which had been supplied with water, and was soon busily engaged in watching and stirring the mix- ture. "Ten men as stout as I, and ten half-pints of bar- ley and ditto of wheat a day!" he muttered. "Large rations! Bah!" seeing the worms floating from the grain upon the surface. "Never mind, Joe Price; call it game." A half-dozen armed men now came up from the river, also much emaciated, though they seemed strong- er than poor Joe Price. Some crabs which they had gathered were cooked, and, with the contents of the kettle, were carried into the hut. Here the men met three others of like appearance; and the whole party    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6802-00000038"/> "   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION, rarvenously, and in solemn silence, devoured their wretched lmeal.  It was eked out, however, with a few scraps of bread made of spoiled wheat. They        a were the only ten men in Jamestown who were able         to stand.    , They had hardly gleaned the last morsels of their , ration, when outcries of distress were- heard from the huts near by. The sick were impatient for their         nurses, whose names they now called in the most plaintive tones. A shriek, a moan, a sobbing and in- '     j coherent prayer, a delirious laugh, a roaring blasphe- my,-to all theese fearful sounds the men listened; and they shuddered.                      1: ;I 've been cursing, and praying too, within an hour," exclaimed Price; " but I can't stand this."

But these sights and f sounds are terrible, here in this wild, wild forest. Come, lads; they cry for us. If we cannot save, we -can comfort them. Come!"  , Such was the condition of Jamestown about a fort- night after the departure of Newport. Food spoiled in the holds of the vessels, a summer heat unknown in England, miserable shelters, labor and exposure to which they had' been unaccustomed, and poison- ous vapors from a rank and humid soil, had wlought dreadfully upon the exiles. Early on the 22d morning of August, two men leaned for a moment upon their spades as they fin- ished their work in the little spot set apart for the dead. Counting from the grave of the boy slain, by the Indians to the four just completed but unoccu- pied, there were now more than forty. "Four in one night!" exclaimed one of the grave- diggers, in a depressed tone, and they dropped their spades and threw  themselves exhausted upon the ground. '"Four out of misery, Price; think of that." "Misery,' William  Lee! I saw something else last night." '"Did you?" said Lee, with a leer; " some religion, hey?" "I saw Stevens die." "Snivelling about his sins." "Shame on you, Lee! and on me too.   For the matter of such mocking I 've do:ne my share, God forgive me!" "Now   you 're thinking of your mammy, Price.

But there was a strange " twitching like," as Price would. have called it, of his eyelids, and about the muscles of his mouth.

' The rb lial for that morning was over.   THE BRUISED REED.       69 So went the nights, and so went the mornings, and so went the days, to September. The little row of graves had become longer and longer, - by ones, by twos, by threes, and sometimes by- fours, --until fifty men slept there under the sod. During all this season of distress the President, Wingfield, kept aloof from the sufferers, avoiding also all exertion and all exposure to the sun. 'This might account for his exemption from sickness; but it seemed strange'that he showed no marlrs of suf- fering .from bad and sAtinted food. The mystery was soon solved by the discovery that he had thriven in secret upon the choicest portions of the stores which he had villanously embezzled. Next, he was detect- ed in a plan with Kendall to embark secretly in the pinnace; leaving to the Indian, to famine, and -to fate, those not necessary to his escape. Both were expelled from the Council. Radcliff'e became nominally President; but the ir- resolute and 'indolent man imposed the labors and responsibilities of his office upon Smith, who, still tottering under the effects of te:rrible sickness, heroi- cally undertook the salvation of the colony. The men had abandoned themselves to at sullen despair, and would not move a muscle for their own relief. They only waited for the worst.  Yet such w-ere Smith?s ' influen'ce and tact, that he succeeded in rousing them to labor, by fellow-feeling, by cheering words, by gen- tle persuasion, by a little well-timed raillery, and-- more than all--by example.   He was the hardest worker on the ground. Under such impulse, the slov-  enly settlement soon put on the aspect of order Cand    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6802-00000040"/> 70   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.         neatness, and every man's dwelling was made com- fortable, with one exception, - Smith's.        At length, even crabs and sturgeon disappeared, which had been their sole resource after the consump- I  tion of their worm-eaten grain. Famine seemed in- t evitable; for they had, great reason to expect hostili-,  ties, rather than supplies, from the Indians. Yet, in i this dark exigency, the savages proffered a temporary supply of corn in the way of traffic. Smith devoutly ji ascribed this to the special interposition of God. But more must be had; and he girded himself to this task I also. In a boat, he dropped. down to a small bay on the - river's nortlhern shore and near its mouth, where he discovered and approached a village of the Indians. They met him with insult, returning courtesy with   {, mockery, and making sport of his necessities. All   i his efforts at conciliation were in vain: they only pro- i voked fresh derision. His patience was at lengthl  exhausted.       -  '             { "This will never do, my lads!" he exclaimed to   i the. half-dozen .men who accompanied him. "We must have respect at least; and I mean to have more. Give the rascals a volley, but fire over their ,- heads."'!  No sooner was it given than the Indians fled to the I woods. "Now, men, reload, and forward to their wig-    ' ,warns?."  Here they found corn in profusion; which his fam- ished men would have seized at once, liad not their leader interfered. "Hold!" said he; " no stealing. . I mean to have P .       '     *g   THE BRUISED REED.      71 corn; but I will have it honestly. Stand on your - guard: the Philistines will be upon you in a trice." His conjecture was right. Sixty or seventy war- riors soon advanced friom their cover in a solid columnn, armed with clubs, shields, bows and arrows, and :hide-  ously bedaubed with paints. Conspicuous in their firont was an image of unearthly appearance, borne aloft, and bedizened wNvith ornaments.  ' That dumb devil} there is their war-god, I sup- pose," said Smith. "Robinson, I leave him to you. Be sure you bring him down when I give the word. Ready, men,--all. No boy's play this time. We can't help it; they must have the balls." ' The Incdians rushed on boldly, with the fiercest demonstrations. Smith gave the word "Fire!" and a parcel of dusliy bodies lay flouncing upon the ground, while the others scoured again for the woods.  "Right, Robinson!" said Smith; "you 've dropped your game. First load, and theki pick him up. Load all, my lads! Neverstir from your tracks with empty pieces."       ' Robinson brought the idol, which was placed con- spicuous and erect as a trophy. "Let us 'wait, nowv, for their movements, boys! Those other devils are picking themselves up from the ground. How is it, Robinson? Was this stuffed monster th'e only dead one there?" "I think so, sir. I ,saw blood, but no one who was n't 'kicking." "So nuch the better.   htter. Whev! what have we now?" A fant;astically dressed Indian was advancing alone from the thicket, unarmed, having none of the ap-    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6802-00000041"/> 72    THE 'YOUTH OF' THE QLD DOMNION. pendages of a warrior, and making signs of abject submission. Smith beckoned him onward until they met.  The, Indian's: distress was evidently for the captive idol; but he was given to understand, partly by a few words which Smith had picked up, and partly by signs, that if six unarmed Indians would    come and. load the boat with corn, Smith would re-" turn the god, pay for the corn, and be tleir friend.  This was the end of all controversy. Corn, venison, turkeys, and other wild-fowl, were brought iii abun-  dance.  The ' boat was laden; the idol returned);  beads, small mirrors, and hatchets were given in pay-  ment f6r the-supplies; the Indians were' penitent and happy; afid their visitors departed in peace. As soon as this invaluable freight was landed at Jamestown, the settlers passed at a sti'ide from death's door to riot. The food which God had brought to them in the wilderness was not only devoured with  greed and thanklessness, but wasted with profane in- sanity. Smith, who, was determined that the settle-   i ment shouild on no account be abandoned, devoted  e himself to feed the men whom he could not bring to  reason. He therefore repeated his trading excur-   - sions with unwearied patience,- excursions which   ?-. he wisely impr:ved to acquire the language of the     natives-; to study their character, habits, and super-; stitions; and to gain their respect by showing them, as he did, that he could move freely among tlihem, by day or by night, without fear. In all- these objects e he succeeded.          ,       '     Returning from one of his .missions some time in    October, he found the colonists in unusual commotion. A gallows explained the mystery.

He was a pas- sionate man, and Radcliffe's words had been stinging insults. The man had resented theml by' attacking the President with his tools, and attempting his life. Upon trial, a jury had found him guilty. He was condemned to be hung, and the sentence was nonw about to be executed. The people were assembled to witness the tragic scene; and the culprit wais even now advancing to his fate. The wretched man mounted the scaffold with an anxious look, and cast his eyes keenly over the little crowd. While the usual preliminaries were in progress, his countenance underwent very marked and singular changes; betraying, alternately, boldness,. terror, expectation, hope, doubt, and at last despair and rage. The executioner was ready, and there was a brief pause in the proceedings. The doomed man now made a startling revelation, addressed directly to Smith.  a Captain Smith, I: thank God that AI see you here. I die justly, and make no defence.

'Smith and others disappeared from the scene, leaving the executioner to. his duty. He promptly found Rad- cliffe, who seemed strangely apathetic about the con- ' spiracy-; but was willing that Smith should manage the affair as he chose, - for hilmself he could not be pothered.  Word was soon brought that Wingfield, Kendall, and others., were astir, and had seized the pinnace. Smith gathered' a- few trusty men in the fort, and brought the guns to bear upon the. pinnace. "  Go"t said he to a soldier, " and give those fellows warning.  Tell them' I 'll sink every soul of them where they are, if they float a foot from  their ncoor- ings.

IPOCAHONTAS. THE Chickahominy is a stream which falls into James River on the north, about six miles above Jamestown.  About the'lst of November, Captain. Smith was exploring the forest at its sources, about seventy miles from its mouth, and attended by an Indian guide. Less than half an hour' previously he had landed from a canoe which he left in. charge of two Englishmen, Robinson and Emry; the barge in which he had left Jamestown having been stopped by shoals twenty miles below, and moored in a small bay or cove, in keeping of her crew, and at a safe dis- tance from either shore. The weather was very cold; the wind had a sullen sound, the foliage a saddened. hue, and the forest a repulsive gloom. But though the adventurous Englishman felt how Nature had changed her aspect since she greeted him with April smiles and beauties, yet he strode on with manly vigor and a soldlier's :fearlessness. Suddenly the woods rang with the savage war- whoop. As suddenly the guide was in the strong gripe of the Englishman, and in a few seconds was bound fast to his left arm. Smith wore garters! "Now, you young "rascal," said he, suspecting the savage of treachery, " if your friends shoot me, they shoot you." 7^    -    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6802-00000044"/> 78   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.  A spent arrow struck him on 'the thigh, and he discovered two Indians adjusting their bows. A shot   A from his gun put them to flight. He reloaded and    I stood on the watch'; the frightened guide, so adroitly j'i ,converted into a shield, much questioning with him-  i? self whether he were an Indian or a thing. "This way, my lad," said Smith, jerking his cap- tive to his front; "there come your friends again." "And now this way," he added, stepping back-    j wards in the direction of the canoe. "It 's like   - English marriage, my friend, --until death do sepa-  / rate us.  Now the woods were thronged, except in his rear, with painted and whooping savages. They were sorely puzzled by the odd contrivance of the white man for the protection of his body; they were terri- bly afraid of coming within range of his musket, and they could not approach him from behind, as will soon appear. But notwithstanding their unwilling-   t ness to hurt the guide, they discharged several arrows from a distance; and Smith managed to return mus- ket-ball, steadily retreating the while, and exhorting  his trembling prisoner to tread in his steps. At last a voice in ambush called to himt    : '"Well!" he answered, still stepping backwards.  ;d "Let the white chief come to us, that we may not hurt him."        'A "The white chief has business. He must hasten.   WA He fears no hurt."  Then, twitching his Indian,    "Speed, friend, speed!"

"The red man's blood for the white man's!" he shouted, and reloaded. "Come, lad, come!"  "T'ley were but women," was the answer. "The great warrior we would not harm. Let him give up his thunder-bearer, anal come to the red man's lodge." "The great warrior is strong. He needs no rest?; and, again catching sight of an Indian, he brought him to the ground. This singular conference was sustained more than half an hour; during which time some twenty or thirty arrows had been discharged, some of which had passed harmless through his clothes. Smith 'had slain three of his assailants, and wounded several others. It was a tragical farce, a laughable tragedy. There was a morass--or rather a shallow creek with a soft, muddy bottom - behind, which had pre- vented the Indians from surrounding :him. Into this he suddenly stepped,! sinking to his middle, and drag- ging his guide with him. The bottom, though in- sufficient for their support, was yet of sufficient firm- ness to hold them fast and helpless. The poor In- dian began to think of hunting-grounds in the skies. Smith retained his gun; and his assailants, "the better part of valor." They dared not approach him. 'There were three hundred warriors hunting this one man. Curiosity urged forward the more remote in the throngs. The foremost, thus brought face to face with Smith, " trembled with fear." Finding himself perishing with- cold, and held fast by the bog, he threw away his arms, and was drawn to firm grounds half frozen and a prisoner.    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6802-00000045"/> 80   THE YOU'TH OF THE OLD DOMNION. He was now carried helpless to the spot where he had left his canoe, and where were the corpses of Robinson and Emry, riddled with arrows. 'The un- happy men had kindled a fire, beside which they had lain and slept,--never to wake. Before this fire Smith was carefully laid, and his limbs were rubbed vigorously by his captors, until, recovering warmth, he was able to stand and move. He was in the power of to whose whothought little of blood or death.  He knew it; and from the moment of his capture he  considered his life lost. But he preserved his pres- ence of mind, and appeared coolly indifferent, to his fate.  "' Who is your chief?" he inquired. "Opechancanough." "The brother of your king, Powhattan?" His brother." "I would see him." Opechancanough soon appeared. He was a fine specimen of the Indian warrior; of large stature, an imposing countenance, and a form admirably propor- tioned and developed. He approached his captive  with the deference and courtesy due to a distin- guished guest, and with the natural dignity of a prince. Smith greeted him with quiet ease and respect, as if at a friendly interview. No allusion was made to the relation which had so suddenly sprung up between them. Seeing that the chief was attracted by a round ivory compass-dial which he carried by his side, Smith took occasion to explain it to him and to his principal warriors, as far as signs and his limited knowledge of their language would allow. They were much amused and puz- 4   POCAHONTAS.        81 zled by the mysterious and life-like motion of the needle. He then digressed - very naturally - to geography, navigation, astronomy, and the different races of men ; giving them, in short, the first dis- course on the natural sciences ever uttered by a Saxon on the continent. Little as they compre- hended all this, in one important thing the lecturer succeeded, - he impressed them with profound rev- erence for himself. They had before stood in awe of him, as the great man and master spirit of the strangers; they had admired his courage, his endur- ance of fatigue, his manly reliance upon himself dur- ing his previous excursions; and they had just seen with what heroic daring and resolution he could defend himself against hundreds. But he now seemed to :them as a pet child of Nature, to whom her, deepest mysteries were free and her grandest works playthings. In other words, they suspected him of, possessing supernatural knowledge" and powers. But there was one thing in nature with which this wonderful captive had had no acquaintance, - Death. How would he meet that? Would he make that a plaything? COs would he scorn it?. Or would he fear it? Opechancanough would see. So he or- dered him to be bound to a tree. Would he ask to be spared? Would he offer' ransom? Would he turn pale and tremble? Would he struggle, or even shut his eyes, when twenty braves should draw their bows against him? Would he cry out and writhe, when twenty arrows should have nailed him where he stood? Opechancanough would see. Smith was led forward,-no hanging back, no    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6802-00000046"/> \2   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.          X tremor. He was bound,--no resistance. The bow- men were drawn ot, ---no prayer for life. The arrows were fixed upo 'the strings, --- no trembling, no pallor. The shafts were drawn and aimed,  no word of ransom. The signal was given; the bow- strings twanged. The white man did not blink his eye, or shriek, or leap, or wrrithe. He stood there, silent and calm. The arrows had dropped at the feet of the archers. Opechancanough had seen! He was satisfied. He was proud of such a captive. He would show him through the country in triumph; for Powhattan himself had never won so great a tro- phy. So he was led in grand procession and great pomp to Orapakes, --a favorite hunting-seat of Pow- hattan, a few miles northeast of the spot wi'here he had first nmet Smith and Newportl thence, to be exhibited to the various tribes on the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers; thence, to Pamunkey, the resi- dence of Opechancanough, near the fork of York River; and finally, to Werowocomoco, then the favorite residence of Powhattan, about twenty-five miles below Pamunkey. This triumphal march oc- cupied about six weeks, during which time he was most bountifully fed, and with the choicest which the savages could provide.  In a letter to the queen of James the First, written in 1616, Smith calls this " six weeks of fattin_ among those grim courtiers " ; for he supposed, during the journey, that they were preparing him by good living to serve as a delicate dish for Powhattan's table. " I think," says Smith's narrative, "his [Smith's] stomacke at that time was not very good.". While at Orapakes, the_ Indians made preparations    POCAHONTAS.        83 to take Jamestown by surprise; thinking it might be done now the great man of the strangers was not there to protect therm. Opechancanough revealed this scheme to his prisoner, adding: "We would have the white warrior be our brother and fight with us." "Against his own people!" "They are dogs, lazy and greedy; women, weak and cowardly. Sucli are not the people of a warrior. Be of our people, who are brave." "The white man may not kill the white man." "But I can kill thee!" said the chief, for the moment in a passion at Smith's refusal. But recovering his dignity, he added: "( Be our brother and our warrior, and save thy life." "The dwelling of the English cannot be taken by the warriors of Powhattan." A scornful incredulity was on the face of the chief as he replied: "Opechancanough offers his captive - life.' ' Do I fear to die?"  ' Opecancanough will give- freedom." "The dwelling of the white men is like the nest of the eagle. The thunderbolts of the Great Spirit play around it." "And as much land as the wlhite warrior wants." o You cannot take the place of the English.', ': And as many wives." "Go first," said Smith, with emphasis, " and see the white man's fort. It is strong." t: We have many warriors, - great wrarriors. T'he white men are weak without their chief. They sleep." "They have strong; walls, and wakeful guards, and great thunder-bearers which will sweep down your    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6802-00000047"/> 84   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. braves as the wind does those snow-flakes from yon- der pine." ' Their chief can make the thunder-bearers sleep." "King of Parnunkey! '" said Smith, earnestly, " you have men. Let your messengers go and see. When they come back, if they saythat your warriors, and I with them, can destroy the lodges of the English, I will talk again about the matter. Till then, I will neither go nor talk. You have my answer. Send and see." The chief pondered a few moments, and then said: "Opechancanough will send."' Smith tore a leaf from a note-book in his posses-. sion, and wrote upon it, informing the colonists of his condition, and of the plot of the Indians; telling them in soime way to give the messengers a terrible idea of their means of defence, and to send him cer- tain toys and trinkets. "Let your runners take that to the English. The English will send to Opechancanough great pres- ents," -specifying the particular articles for which he had written. The runners left " in as severe weather as frost and snow could make," and' returned in threel days with terrific accounts of the huge instruments of death by which the fort was protected. They brought also the identical " great presents " which Smith had enumer- ated to the chief. At this he and his warriors were in amazement. ]t was necromancy.

Thus again did Smith prove the saviour of the colony. So impressed were the Indians with. the idea that he was a being of more than human endowments, that they were extremely anxious to ascertain whether he was disposed to use his gifts to their good or their hurt. At Pamunkey, therefore, they took means to solve this question. For three successive days they submitted their captive to a series of incantations too absurd and frivolous for detail. It is enough to say, that his guards were withdrawn from his presence, and&amp; he was shut up face to face with half a dozen savages in the guise of fiends, and compelled to en- dure their wild and frantic distortions, their ludicrous antics and grimaces, their howls and shrieks, their fantastic dances and silly mummeries, without cessa- tion and without food, from morning to night of each day,-p- pantomime by which a man of only common self-possession would have been goaded to rage, and one of sensitive nerves to frenzy. To what conclu- sion the conjurers camre, neither history nor tradition affirms, '  Before his captivity, the fame of Smit;h had reached the most remote and. humble of Powhattan's subjects. They had conceived of him as the presiding genius of the colony,; as the wise, the bold, the energetic, the hero-man of the strangers. But from the day of his capture in the swamps of the Chickahominy, he became a sort of demigod in the eye of the supersti- tious people.

The few who had seen him on his errands of traffic 'of  course lknew his person truly. But to the many who had only heard, he was simply the champion, the patriarch, the wonderful sage, of the white men. For them, a wild imagination drew and colored his portrait. No wonder, then, that grave warriors and "grim courtiers," and women and youths and maidens, flocked to behold him on his way; and especially, as he waited with fearless composure in the village of Powhattan for his introduction to the presence of the chief. But how great must have been the amaze- ment of the throng, when "'the champion" dcinidled to the. stature of a common man; "the sage ' stood before them comely and vigorous; and in "the patri- arch" they beheld an' attractive yet imposing youth of twenty-seven years!. Imagine the sensations of scarred and brawny veterans, as they scanned the form, the features, the quiet attitude of the captive; of the shrinking matron, as she looked from behind her savage lord; of the timid girl, as she peeped through the mat which covered the door of her hut. So distinguished a prisoner Powhattan would re-a ceive in state; and considerable time elapsed before preparations could be made. The great chief, "whose will was supreme and whose nod was law," had at length gathered and arrayed his court.  On 'either side, and all along the spacious apartment or hall, were ranged two rows of women; in front of them, two rows of men; all in their best clothing, their best paints, and their best ornaments.

From his neck hung a rich chain of great pearls. .A pillow of dressed deer-skin, beautifully embroidered with shells and beads, supported his arm; and two young women sat with him on either side, their jet- black hair sprinkled with snow-white down, and their necks encircled by bands of inferior pearls. A peal of welcome greeted the captive at his en trance. Then a profound silence, arid the steadfast gaze of every eye, evinced the respect and admira- tion of the assembly. Smith, though received with grave and stately dignity by Powhattan, was treated more like a princely guest, than like a 'prisoner whose life hung upon the decision of the hour. A young beauty of the woods, the Queen of Appamattuck, brought him water to wash his hands; and another presented to him a bunch of feathers for a napkin. Choice food was then set before him, and he was bid- den to eat while the council were discussing the ques- tion of his life or his death. "I think his stomacke at that time was not very good." Immediately behind the chief, and half hidden by his flowing robe, sat a little girl of " twelve or thirteen years of age." 'She was a specimen of Indian beauty unrivalled in all Powhattan's dominions; and right proud was he to call her "; daughter."  There was sin- gular intelligence in her vivid dark eye, while the fringe which overhung and softened its brilliance: was a true type of her native modesty. Her faultless form had the peculiar charm which belongs to girlhood just ready to assume the' full outline and finished grace to which nature impels it.   <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6802-00000049"/> 88   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. At Smith's entrance, her countenance betrayed sur- prise; and, no longer shrinking as if for protection under the shadow of her royal father, she sat erect, intently observing every movement and feature of the captive. The discussion respecting his fatevas long and solemn. As it proceeded, her attitude Jier fea- tures, changed. She turned her earnest eve from each successive speaker to the prisoner, to her father, to her uncles, who'were great in council as in war; showingo evidently that she had a speech'in ihler heart, and that, if sie were not a little girl, she would speak it. She heard the grave counsellors of her father utter words of admiration, of respect, and even of reverence, for their captive; but, to her amazemient, she perceived that all their praises were arguments for his death. They would have him killed because he was brave and valiant and wise! because lhe was the strong arm, the good head, and the big heart of the English!.  because, if lie died, his brothers would perish as the leaves do when the sapling is severed from its root! She glanced at the young and noble man whose vir- tues were crimes, who was a culprit because a hero. Pity tapped at the door. of hei young heart, and en- tered; and then opened the fountain there' till its wa- ters wCeiled up and flowed forth in tears. She looked in her father's face; but there were no tears there, no sign of pity; nothing but sternness,- heartless, savage sternness. She gently pulled at the skirt of his robe; but he testily put it in place again, and bent his brow darkly upon his victim. The decision was given. The young warrior must die.

A great stone was just then brought in and laid before him. She looked up at his face again, through her tears; but it was sterner than before. Then she crept around upon his knee, threw herself upon his neck, and sobbed. He was surprised and angry; but he loved her: she W\as the pride and darling of his heart. So he removed her gently, with a look and word of re- proof. But she would not be reproved. She clung to his arm, laid her head upon his shoulder, and whis- pered pleading, piteous words in his ear. Passion, for the moment, got the better of the father's heart, and he thrust the child away; frowning because the gravity of-a council, and dignity of a king, were en- croached upon by a soft-hearted girl. She made one imploring gesture, then sank at his feet, buried her face in her hands, and sobbed aloud. All this intercession had been rapid andi brief. Powhattan petulantly signed to one of the young women 'who shared his seat of state to remove the child; but hearing a noise, she looked up and saw the white man stretched on the ground, his head upon a stone, and an Indian stUanding over him with a war-club, watching for the signal of the chief. 'With a faint scream, the maiden sprang from her crouching posture, knelt beside the prostrate man, threw her arms around his person, and laid her head upon his, above the stone of death. She spoke no word, but looked.

She closed her eyes. The grave is not more silent than was the council-room of Powhattan. "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty." The boar out of the wood would have wasted, tile wild-beast of the field would have devoured, the ville which He was planting. To save it--for the life of Smith was the life of Virginia- He interposed an unbaptized infant. By the dumb eloquence of a tear- ful girl, He brought to naught the counsels of princes.

He relented; yielded. The decree of death was reversed. "I will spare him," said the despotic chief, " for a servant. He shall make hatchets for me, and bells and rattles for her." Yet, for some reason, the chief's heart was further softened towards his captive. Instead of using him as a servant, he instantly received him to the intimacy of a fiiend; and even promised him his liberty, a large tract of land, and " for ever to esteeme him his sonne," if he would send him from Jamestown two pieces of cannon and a grindstone, which his heart exceedingly longed for. To this Smith promptly agreed. The chief was true to his word; and on the third day after his head lay a mark for the executioner's mace, Smith was on his way to Jamestown. So little, however.

But, says his narrative, "Almighty God, 'by his divine providence, had mollified. the hearts of those stern barbarians with compassion." He was now to fulfil his- promise. He therefore presented to his guides a grindstone and two can- non, bidding the Indians take them to Powhattan. 'They found them somewhat too heavie."  Ugh!" exclaimed their chief, who was. a faithful captain of Powhattan. "Rawhunt! I keep my Wvord," said Smnith. "I promised. I give. You will not take? The Indians looked blank, and Rawhunt gravely shook his head. "Very well, RaNwhunt; but you must tell Powhat- tan what I have done." "We w\ill tell." "And tell him also how the thunderers speak, and how they strike. Look at yonder tree," pointing to a veteran pine loaded with icicles; "I will tell the thrn- derers to strike it." The cannon were well charged with stones. The ice flew; .the huge branches crashed and fell; the savages turned ad n fled. So terribly were they fright- ened, that it was not without some ado that they could be found and brought to conference again. But this done, Smith atoned for their disappointment and fright by presents for themselves, Powhattan, and his family. The party then left, highly delighted with their trinkets, and with clear convictions of the ter:i- ble power of cannon and white men.* The 'statements in this chapter will be found in Smith, 46-49; Stith, 50 - 56; Burk, I. 104 - 116.    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6802-00000051"/> CHAPTER    VIII. THE ROYAL SHARPER.-- THE CONFLAGRATION.- GOLD. IT was now late in the month of December. The number of the colonists was reduced toforty. They were suffering for want of provisions, which they had heedlessly wasted; and no one amnong them had- skill or enterprise enough to supply their lack. Neither was any one competent to maintain peace and order. To complete their sad condition, they were at strife among themselves; the larger number being resolved to abandon the settlement, and just on the eve of departure. Under such circumstances, Captain Smith's re- appearance, after his seven weeks' captivity, to those who had thought him dead, was an event of great joy to all save the very few to whom his popularity was offensive, and his soldierly decision irksome. He promptly met the present emergency, and suppressed the attempt at desertion. Once more, with cannon and musketry pointed upon the pinnace, he gave the discontented their choice,--to stay or sink.. Of course they stayed. But when he related the circumstances of his deliv- erance, made known the change in Powhattan's tem.. per, his present liberal disposition, and the profusion of food at his command, the colonists took heart, and looked upon the future with hope. Hardly were his    THE ROYAL SHARPER.       93 , cheering words uttered, and comprehended by his de-, spending companions, before they were verified. Poe- ahontas herself, bright with smiles and happy in her errand, appeared before the garrison, with a train of attendants laden with baskets of provisions. A child, bringing its offering with a loving and un- selfish heart to minister to the want or pleasure of another; in its simplicity and purity of intent, uncon- scious that it is doing, an angel-errand.; and, like an angel, absorbed and blessed in the happiness it im- parts ; --what a lessoln, what a rebuke, to its elders, so thoughtless of a neighbor's want, so callous to a brother's sorrow or a sister's need, so apt, so glib, in only saying, "Be warmed, be clothed"!       ( Trhis was not a passing fancy of Pocahontas.  While the want of the English continued,/it was her habit. .Every few days, she brought her precious. gifts; and quietly returned to her lodge, to dream of the happy faces which she had left in the white man's home.           (  Nor was this all. Otler Indians came, bringing presents of food from Pocahontas or Powhattan. Others still, brought from their granaries to exchange. Their reverence for Smith, and their confidence in him, were unbounded. They would stand aloof from the fort, under cover of the woods, and call aloud his name. But they would neither approach nor show themselves until he had made his appearance; nor would they sell either corn, beans, or venison until he had fixed their prices.  Such was the state of things when Newport re- turned from England, with new emigrants, provisions, and other necessaries. This man, among other un-    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6802-00000052"/> "   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. enviable peculiarities, " was a very great and impor- tant person in his own talk and conceit." H e had a mean jealousy of Captain Smith, on account of his brilliant /qualities and the estimation in which he was held by the colonists"; and, it may be added, on account of his almost limitless influence with the natives. In this latter sentiment he harmonized with the President and Council, of which body, it will be. remembered, he was one. Smith's policy of trade - namely, rating English wares at the value set upon them by the Indians themselves- was at once aban- doned. To magnify themselves in the eyes of the natives as men superior to Smith in wealth and in generosity, Newport and his associates adopted a lav- ish system of traffic, giving four times as much as Smith had done in exchange for Indian commodities. In addition, Newport scattered presents without con- sideration or stint. Ruinous as this course was to the interests of the colony, it secured, temporarily at least, the selfish end which Newport had in view. It exalt- ed him in the opinion of the natives, and in that of Powhattan himself. The great chief of the Indians longed to see the g'eat chief of the English. Accordingly, Newport and Smith arranged for a visit to Werowocomoco: Newport, to enjoy the ad- miration of a savage ; Smith, to strengthen the chief's conviction of English power, and to confirm a good understanding by friendly intercourse; Newport, through vanity; Smith, for the public good. They left Jamestown in the pinnace, with forty armed men, and were accompanied by Mr. Matthew 'Scrivener, a worthy man, who had just arrived in the colony, and had been elected a member of the Council. They   THE ROYAL SHARPER.      95 had hardly reached the mouth of James River, before Captain Newport manifested signs of uneasiness; for "he was a man veiy fearful in times of danger." Will it do to trust these fellows, Captain Smith?" ' The Indians? That depends upon circumstances. I would not absolutely trust them at any time." "Well, under present circumstances? ' "Perhaps I ought to say, not at all." "But we are about to!" "Not literally, Captain Newport. So many mus- kets look more like trust in ourselves." "You cannot Use a musket, Captain Smith,'unless you can see your markt; and these fellows skulk. If there is anything I detest, it is a creeping scoundrel who will not show himself. A man may be walling in those woods, fancying himself alone, until the yells of the devils are in his ears, and their arrows flying, -- just as it VTas with you, sir, in Clickahominy swamp." "That is very true, Captain Newport." C   Upon nmyword, Captain, that was a ticklish affair," "' But ' all 's well that ends well,' as Will Shake- speare has proved." "O yes, Captain; when a thing ends well, you call it comedy,'or rqmance, or what not; but if that fel- low's war-club had developed your brains, it would  have been simple tragedy. Not very agreeable, that sort of thing. Little girls don't grow on every bush, Captain Smith." "But I see something in. every bush," looking at the neighboring shore. "Do Vyou?  Faith, Captain, I thought I saw one myself! Where, sir?  "One! one what, sir?  -4-*,    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6802-00000053"/> 96   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD I)OMNION. "An Indian, to be sure." "You mistook me, sir. I said, ' I see somethingr in every bush.' I meant, sir, that I have experienced the protection and deliverance of the Almighty so often, and so wonderfully, that I cannot help recog- nizing His presence and care everywhere." "O, that is all well enough. Yet; men do get their brains knocked out, after all. But tell me plainly, sir, do you think it safe to prosecute our course?" "Certainly I do, sir." Do you, Mr. Scrivener?"  "I confide in Captain Smith's judgment and expe- rience, sir. I see no danger." "But the devil of it is, Mr. Scrivener, that among these fellows one never sees it . The first he knows of it, it 's on him. For my part, I think we had bet- ter give up this fool's errand, before we get our necks into some noose or other." Smith saw that he was serious, and protested; and Scrivener, who was a man of good sense and cool judgilent, joined him. For half an hour, the matter was debated warmly; and it, was niot without much argument and reiterated assurances that their guard was sufficient security, that Newport consented to proceed. At last they reached the mouth of York River and the shore of Werowocomoco. The landing was bad, and in Newport's eyes ominous.  They soon encountered a creek. "What now?" exclaimed Newport, as'the stream, half waterdialf ice; met his eye. "Do you take me for a water-rat? In the name of humanity, how am I to get over here?" "' By the bridge, sir."   THE ROYAL SHARPER.      97 ' Bridge! what bridge?" / "That, sir," replied Smith, suppressing a smile, and pointing to a rude structure of poles and bark. Newport looked at the affair, and then looked at Captain fmith, with a half-angry, half-doubting ex- pression. At length he asked, in a tone as though he would solemnly appeal to Smith's honor: "Do you mean to say to me, Captain Smith, that that thing was ever intended for men to walk on?" ' Certainly, sir: we must cross upon it."' "Do you suppose will?" "I trust so, sir. It is a very rustic affair, but suffi- cient." "Humph!" "I will cross it, Captain Newport. The rest of us will cross it. Thalt will prove its safety." This was done; and after much persuasion, New- port ventured. .The frail structure shook and swayed under his tread, and he carefully inspected every spot upon which he was to plant his foot, until on solid rround. But when they came to a second creek with another like crossing, he hung back with decis- ion. He began to surmise Indian craft and treachery. "These things are man-traps, Captain Sm ith. That I got safely over one, is no proof that I shall get safely over two." "Captain Newport, they are the only kind of bridges which these simple people have. They are built for their own use." "Not so very simple, Captain Smith. Not too simple to be cunning. Suppose, sir, we get stuck fast in one of these affairs, - and they look 'as though: we might, - up come some ten score of savages, with 9    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6802-00000054"/> 98   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION, their infernal whoops, and what are we to do? Can't fight, -- can't run, - a pretty scrape!" "Captain Newport, I have had some acquaintance with Indian habits and cunning; but this is the first time I ever heard of man-traps i 'Virginia. Depend upon it, you a:re mistaken, sir." "I am not apt to be mistaken, Captain Smith. Things look very much as though Powhattan had ar- ranged some deviltry. For my part, I go no farther." "Very well, Captain Newport. I am willing to go. Retain twenty men, if you please, in the pin- nace, and I will advance with twenty." To this Newport consented. Smith had proceeded but a little way, when he was met by two or three hundred Indians, among whom was Nantaquis, the king's son, --"the most manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit I ever saw in a salvage," said Smith, in his letter to Queen Anne. These men were sent by Powhattan as an escort of honor, and welcomed their visitor with loud shouts, which must have been heard by Newport, and prob- ably to his great alarm. Powhattan received his late captive with great pa- rade, in presence of his wives and chief warriors, and of a guard of four or fiv6 hundred men. Proclama- tion was made, warning all, on pain of death, to refrain from all harm, and even discourtesy, to the strangers. Powhattan gave his guest a cordial wel- come, and a seat beside his own royal couch. Smith entered leading a beautiful white greyhound, which, with a suit of clothes of scarlet cloth and an English hat, he immediately offered for the chiefs acceptance. Gladly and proudly were they accepted, and with all $ .   THE ROYAL SHARPER.      99 that easy but dignified courtesy for which Powhattan was remarkable.

Water to wash and food were next in order. "Where is your father?" inquired Powhattan, meaning Captain Newport. "-Ie will visit you to-morrow"; not doubting that Newport's courage would revive when he should find that his forerunner had escaped snares and ambus- cade. ' Where are the great guns and the hatchet-sharp- ener which you promised me?" said the chief, archly. ' Your men were not strong enough to bring them S "Yes, yes," with a hearty laugh; s Rawhunt told me how it was. But" -with mock gravity -' my white friend should Speak the truth." "Do I not speik the truth?" said Smith, startled, and a little puzzled. "No," with still more seriousness. "In what do I speak untrue-?" "My men were strong enough. -The fault was in the guns. They were too big." Smith laughed in his turn; and Powhattan added, with a waggish look: "The thing can easily be done. Try some that are smaller." But," said Smith, adopting the royal humor," where is the land which you promised me?" "You shall have it, you shall have it," was the quick reply. "But I shall expect these warriors of    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6802-00000055"/> 100   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DO1INION. yours first to lay their arms at my feet, as all my subjects do." Our enemies demand that; not our friends." Smith then assured him that the English were his friends, and urged him not to doubt it. He also said, that, wheniever Powhattan should be ready for it, the English would join him to reduce to his subjection the neighboring tribes his enemies. This address Powhattan received with undisguised satisfaction, and replied to it in a long oration, which he con- cluded by creating Smith a werowance, or chief, of the nation. In such pleasant intercourse, with feasting, dancing, singing, and various sports, they passed the day and evening. The next morning Newport was found by Smith. Convinced that he might venture his precious life, he was introduced to Pbwhattan and his court, and was received with the same distinction and hospitality which had been shown to Smith. Thus passed the day. At night the English returned to the pinnace. But when they were together again at breakfast, Pow- hattan expressed displeasure at the presence of the English soldiers. "Why do you come with armed men to a friendly talk? Do I treat you so? Look at my men; they have no weapons. Am I not your friend? Why doubt me? Why fear? -This looks as though you did not trust me." ' We have no doubt' and no fear," said Smith; "but it is the custom of our country, that our cap- tains should always be attended by their soldiers." Newport, ascertaining the subject of conversation,   THE ROYAL SHARPER.     101 went at one stride from timidity to rash confidence; and, turning to the soldiers, he ordered them all to the pinnace. "Then I go too," said Smith. "It is necessary to proper prudence." He went. But this did not satisfy the chief. He was suspicious enough not to like the idea of Smith out of his sight, and with an armed force. Newport then sent Mr. Scrivener to take charge of the soldiers in Smith's stead. Still2 Powhattan murmured, until his attention was diverted by the exhibition of ibrin- kets and wares for the purpose of traffic. Three or four days were now occupied with various pastimes and with trade. At last the chief himself undertook to drive a bar- gain. Addressing Newport, through Smith as inter- preter, he said: ' I am a great prince. You are a great prince." He had exalted notions of Newport's civil rank. "It is beneath our princely station to buy and sell and bargain. We leave such things for mean men. Let us act like princes. Lay before me the goods which you think would please a prince like myself. I will choose what suit my mind. Then, in my turn, I will lay before you their value in my goods. Thus we will be satisfied with each other, and without being pedlers." This majestic proposition Smith faithfully trans- lated, but added: ; Beware, sir, what; you do. He intends to jew you." "I know how to manage a savage, Captain Smith, and am not to be jewed by one, if he does call him- self a big prince. I have my wits about me." He immediately ordered all his goods to be spread 9* *'         <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6802-00000056"/> 102   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD :DOMNION. out. Powhattan, with the utmost coolness, selected all that he cared for; in return for which he should have given about twenty hogsheads of corn. With an air ,of stately generosity, he gave - four bushels! :I Newport was exceedingly nettled; not merely because i he had been so brazenly outwitted, but because his i! merchandise was now exhausted, and the supplies   ;; which he intended to provide for the whole colony : ,  were, by a sort of sleight of hand, reduced to four bushels of corn. Done by a savage, too! EBut it was done, and the chapfallenl white prince had no remedy. He could only vent his irritation upon the very man who had warned 'him. But Smith, though he resented this with the spirit of a soldier, generously resolved to devise some means to 'step between Newport and his  mortification. Turning the attention of the parties,  as if nothing unusual had happened, to some sports , i which were going on, he suffered to be seen partially, and as if by accident, some beads in his possession  unlike any which had been ]nown to the Indians. Powhattan's eye and fancy were caught. He sud- denly forgot his dignity in his desire to trade.    : "But .these are jewels of great value,". Smith ob- ; jected; ;' too precious for trade."          ; "Yet what will not friendship do?" replied the chief. : And what will not Powhattan's new wero-  wance, once his captive, do for the father of Poca-  hontas?"I        *             :; It-knew  human nature.

Thus did Smith excite the cupidity and royal am- bition of the chief, and manifest greater reluctance to part with his precious merchandise; while Powhattan, on his part, was the more eager, and rose rapidly in hias offers. At last Smith was overcome. : 6Powhattan did spare my life. He snared it for the sake of Pocahontas. He shall havehs wish,'. adding, with great seriousness and emphasis, 4: for Pocahontas' sake." For a pound or two of these jewels, Smith received about three hundred bushels of corn. But this was not all. A new and valued article of trade was thus introduced. Others of royal blood were ambitio'us; and sky-blue beads were purchased at enormous rates by the greatest of the chiefs, for themselves, their wives and children, and became privileged ornaments for the nobility. Through their whole visit, the English received- unbounded and even. assiduous hospitality from Pow- hattan. He manifested no uneasiness except on one    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6802-00000057"/> 104   THE YOUTH OP THE OLD DOMNION. point, that Newport and Smith would never pass the day in his presence---their nights were spent on board the pinnace --without more or less attendants in arms. He tried repeatedly to induce them " not -to bring their pieces with them lest his women should be frightenedy'; and took particular dislike to the sword and pistol which Smith always carried 'upon his person. Newport--at what; risks we .cannot know--would have humored the chief, but Smith always contrived to be under proper guard. After a visit of two days to Opechancanough at Pamunkey, they returned to Werowocomoco; and thence, with a full freight of provisions, to Jamestown. The weather was intensely cold; but the settlers had comfortable, though rude, dwellings for their pro- tection. They gathered around their ample hearths, enjoying the cheerful light and heat, While the wind whistled and the sleet rattled without. :Bread was now plenty; venison and wild-fowl smoked upon their trenchers; they passed their days in moderate labor or in idleness, and their long evenings in songs: or social games, in talking of English homes, or build- ing castles in the air. They had no fear of savages, i no fear of famine, no fear of sickness, no fear of sher- iffs. This last was .a special luxury to rhany of the new-comers. Yet, while thus enjoying the present, and reckless of the future, an enemy was in their midst. In one of the tenements the wood was blaz- ing and crackling upon the hearth, and the fire-light was dancing upon the rough wall, the simple furni- ture, the humble bed, and the burnished muskets. It was taking an inventorv of all these things.

It fed, too, on clothing, and. bed- ding, and furniture, and muskets, and swords. It wound its long red arms around the granaries arind laughed and danced over every kernel which Newport had brought from Wierowocomoco. It did not spare even the dwelling of ;' good Master HHunt, the de- voted preacher and peacemaker of the settlement, but made havoc and ashes of all the/worthy man's books, --his only comforts and true conmpanio:ns in the wil- derness, except his God. There were only three things of his which the fire did not touch,-- the clothing on his back, the peace of God in his heart, and his house eternal: in the heavens. The " genrle- men? swore' over their losses, which time -might re- place; but Master Hunt, though he was poor and could get- io more boolks, had not a heart to murmur, for the voice of Jesus whispered within, and there w as a great calm there. They raved over the destruction of their provisions@; but Master Hunt had bread to eat which they knewr not of. - They fretted under- bereavement; he quieted and comforted himself as a child that is weaned of his mother. Such is the difference, on the sea of life, between the filial and the unfilial. It was truly a melancholy sight, - the little clear- ing in the wilderness blackened with the smoking  ,         , o,    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6802-00000058"/> 106   THE YOUTH OP THE OLD DOMNION. ruins of so many habitations, - of so much which is essential in a biting winter to the comfort and life of men far from their country, and surrounded by inter- minable forests, It did require some nerve, and strong faith in God, and a chastened spirit, for a man to stand there half clad, shelterless, shiv , grubbing in the ashes for half-burnt corn, yet compos and un- repining and hopeful. And it did require sowe dar- ing, and some searing of the heart, for a man to stand there upbraiding the only Power who could bring relief. Yet some did it; kicking against the goad, rather than kiss the rod. The fire had spared much; some of their dwellings, their ammunition, and food enough to sustain them, with economy, for the present. But now came a worse calamity. The same in- sanity which makes men f6rget and distrust the true God, makes them weary themselves, for very vanity, in slaving to the god of this world. Mammon had prompted a large proportion of the last immigrants, -" serving-men, libertines, bankrupts in character, bankrupts in fortune," outcasts from the drawing- room, the tap-room, the brothel, -greedy for gold, and dreaming that it might be had in Virginia for the gathering. To help them to their visionary fortunes, they had brought with them two goldsmiths, two re- finers, and one jeweller. Their god drave them to their tasks. "Lo! here is gold, -here, at your gate, - here, in this little rivu- let in the woods. See, how it glitters! Dig, - dig, -dig. Dig, and regain your fortunes. Dig, and renew your riotous living." It did glitter there,-- in the bed of the brook, and along its brink, and in the stones and rocks on its   GOLD.         107 banks,-in small particles, but abundant, yellow as heart could wish, and bright with promise. It is gold'! it is gold!" said Newport and Martin. "It is gold," said the goldsmiths. "It is gold," said the refiners, as they came out from their secret "trials." "Until you can show me a more substantial trial, I am not enamored of your dirty skill," said Captain Smith; and so said Mr. Scrivener; and so, perhaps, a few others. - But the vote was "Gold."  And the order was, "Work, men, work!   A fig for house-building! Delve, shovel, wheel, and carry." So the men worked and shovelled and carried, with stinted food and stinted sleep and stinted quarters, through some ten or twelve weeks of winter cold; and the ship was loaded with sparkling treasure, to be discharged and purified and coined in England. Thither it wrent, and there it was discharged,-- a cargo of mud and *mica added to the bulk of Britain! Mammon is a despot; his gifts, the apples of Sodom. The scanty supplies of grain which the fire had spared weie mostly taken for the home-bound sailors; for the bait of Satan had kept them there fourteen weeks instead of fourteen days, and the ship's stores were exhausted. The colonists were left hungry and faint; living on 'idily dole of meal and water, "wild fruits of the earth, crabs, muscles, and such like"; worn with toil; suffering from cold and wet, in mis- erable and crowded shelters. Before spring opened, there were many added to the row of graves which began with the murdered boy, and where Stevens and Gosnold lay.     <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6802-00000059"/> CHAPTER IX. THE LITTLE AMBASSADRESS. RADCLIFFE, the President, was a weak-minded and indolent m an, awho thought it beneath his official dig- nity to leave the fort. Martin's ill-health, and his ' rage for gold, rendered him for all useful purposes a cipher. With them were associated others, form- ing a strong party, jealous of the enterprise and influ- ence of Captain Smith, disposed to thwart his plans, and more zealous for their own ease and indulgence, than for the protection: and thrift of the common- wealth. Thus every task necessary to safety, com- fort, and prosperity depended upon the counsels and activity of Smith, Scrivener, and some of the sub- stantial colonists whom good sense and manliness united with them. By their means, when Newport and his cargo were gone, the ground was planted, and new buildings were erected on the ruins of the old. While engaged in this latter task, they were cheered by a new arrival. The barque Phcenix, Captain Nelson, had left Eng- land in company with Newport, but had been dis- masted, driven to the West Indies, and detained there through the winter. She now brought the remainder of the colonists sent out under Newport's charge, the number in both ships being a hundred and twenty. She also brought stores 'for the colonists sufficient for it    THE LITTLE AMBASSADRESS.    109 six months. She was discharged and reloaded with all possible despatch; taking in a cargo of cedar, which the joint and strenuous efforts of Smith, Scrive- -ner, and their associates, aided by Nelson, secured for her, in opposition to the counsels and adherents of Martin, who would h ave loaded her with yellow mica. She left for her return on the 2d of June. During her stay certain events occurred which deserve notice. As Captain Smith was one day inspecting the out- of-door affairs of the colony, at some little distance from the fort, he caught a glimpse of two Indians skulking in the edge of the forest near him. "Ha! the thieves again!" He had hardly said the words before the Indians leaped from their cover, painted and armed as if on a war-path. They strode fiercely towards him, and appeared as if intending to make him their prisoner. The demonstratipn was not to be mistaken. Smith was alone, and'without weapons. Throwing himself into an attitude which denoted both his fearlessness and his defiance, "Welcome, braves!" said he with coolness. "I did think you were common thieves, sneaking about like, cowardly women and weak boys. I was wrong.   You are warriors, - uncommon thieves. You would steal me, would you?" "The white werowance must go with us." i' Then take him"; and Smith bent upon them a look which said more than' his words. The men seemed awed, but advanced.   Smith moved leisurely and warily towards the fort, keeping his eye full upon his assailants. They now seemed to take courage. One came upon him on one side, the other upon the other, brandishing their war-clubs, ' 10      .  ,    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6802-00000060"/> "O   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. and then running round and round him as if deter- mined to bring him to the ground; or, as Smith after- wards described it, ; circling about mee, as though they would have clubbed mee like a hare." But he steadily and composedly continued his way to the fort, so far overawing them that they dared not strike; while they were so eager in their object, that they danced attendance upon his person, even within the palisades, and were joined by some sixteen others. Smith instantly ordered the gates to be closed. The whole number, surprised at a measure so utterly at variance with the late remissness of the garrison, were seized by the soldiers and imprisoned. Their asso- ciates without the fort respectfully opened a neghtia- tion for their release. Smith replied: ' Bring back all the swords, spades, shovels, and other tools which you have stolen from us, and your men shall go free. Otherwise,. I will hang them."  '"We have just caught two of your men in the woods," was the retort, " and will treat them as you treat ours."? ' Will you, indeed! Throw open the gates, men!" He instantly sallied with his soldiers, whom of late he had kept under regular drill with special reference to Indian warfare; and, though he shed nb blood, so frightened the Indians without by his military array, that the two English truants were given up, and peace was implored without conditions. In this Smith was acting upon his own responsi- bility, contrary to the indolent temper of the Council, and the directions of the Company to give no offence to the natives. He had been compelled to do so, however,   f,               .  ,  i THE LITTLE AMBASSADRESS. '   l." by the insufferable er croachments of the natives them- selves. Suddenly, al without apparent cause, they had commenced a re glar system of thieving; at first slyly, but soon with more and more boldness, until they had Even ventured upon violent means. This was well known to the President and Council; but they preferred safety and ease in their own houses, and had suffered the evil to grow without resenting it. Smith, though highly indignant at this state of things, had allowed them to take their own course until he was personally interfered with., One fellow whom he had briefly imprisoned for sword-stealing, afterwards attacked him, aided by three others, threatening his life. But he had made them smart for their audaci- ty; and merely this one instance of rigorous treat- ment had caused a temporary suspension of thievish practice, and even a voluntary restoration of some articles which had been taken. But the depredations had soon been resumed, and with more boldness than before. The present assault upon his person Smith resolved to turn to account, and to prosecute the affair accord- ing to his own notions of wise policy, and after his own fashion. He would throw himself alone and un- authorized into the breach, rather than expose the colony to the loss of tools and arms, ard, ultimately, to extinction. He proceeded, therefore, to deal with his prisoners as though supreme power had been vest- ed in himself alone. He transferred the Indians to the Phenix, and there placed them in ward. Select- ing one of them, he removed him. from his compan- ions to the hold of the vessel, accompanied by six soldiers with, their muskets.

Without a word spoken, and with great solemnity, the culprit was bound securely to the ,mainmast. At a signal, the soldiers levelled their glittering muskets at his breast, and waited. The poor wretch quivered as he looked at those iron mouths and at the determined countenance of his judge. After an impressive pause, Smith addressed the offender. "Macanor! you are a counsellor of Paspahegh,' - one of I'owhattan's tributary, chiefs. ' You therefore know something which I must know, or you die." "Mapanor does not fear to die." "Then--" the sentence ended by a look. at the muskets. "But --" "But what? Speak quickly." '; Macanor would die under the blue sky and in battle." "  No fwords. Answer me, or die here." "What would the 'white chief know?" "Why do Powhattan's subjects steal my swords and the tools of my men?" "Because he orders it.." "What has been done with them?" a All have been given to Powhattan." "Why does he order them to be stolen, if he is my friend? ':',  a The English werowanice has offended Pow- hattan." "How?  "When your father [Newport] went away to his country, Powhattan. sent him a present of twenty.   THE LITTLE AMBASSADRESS.    .113 turkeys, for which he received twenty swords. He sent turkeys to you, and you gave him no swords." "Did 1 send him nothing?" 5 "Jewels and other pleasant things:, such as you chose, but not what he chose. Powhattan wanted swords."     ' "For what?" After a moment's-, hesitation, the Indian answered in a stammering way: ' To fight his enemies, the Monacans." Smith saw that this was an, invention to mask the truth, and replied sternly: "Macanor! I have not 'brought'you here to tell me lies.' I will have the truth, or --  pointing to hi s soldiers, c"I am no woman, Macanor, to be fooled with.   Answer me the truth, Why does Powhattan want the sworcs of the English?

"I see, Macanor, that you choose to die in this dark hole, like a dog., and to be thrown to the fishes." ' Because --" "Silence, Macanor! I ask you no more questions. Tell me all you know about Powhattan's plots. T'ell me straight along, or you die where you stand! Speak or not, as you will." Macanor chose wisely; although Smith had no intention of taking life. He now stated rapidly, but distinctly, that Powhattan and all his chiefs had long arranged a plan for the destruction of the English; that this had been done before Smith's capture, which was a part of the scheme; that nothing but their 10 lo    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6802-00000062"/> "4   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOM:NION. dread of his supernatural powers, and the interference of Pocahontas, had saved his life; that Powhattan, conscious of his inability to cope with English weap- ons, was anxious to obtain them and use them against their owners; that Powhattan and all his chiefs had agreed to pretend friendship with the English until. the return of Newport, who was then to be enticed to a feast and slain, while other parties of the English were to be enticed in other directions to meet the same fate. I' That is all:, I suppose, Macanor?  -"It is all." "You have done well to save your life, and shall soon go free." Macanor was unbound, and taken to an apartment by himself; and a volley of musketry was fired from t e deqk, to intimidate the other prisoners, who could hea' u not see. They were then led in their turn, onel] e, to the hold, and underwent a like exam- inati . By some of them, the statement of Macanor respecting the conspiracy was confirmed, and all agreed in saying that Powhattan received the topls and swords. "These fellows have made an important confession, Mr. Scrivener," said Captain Smith, after narrating what had just transpired on shipboard. "Thanks to your shrewdness and resolution, Cap- tain. But what shall we do with them now?" "Keep them for a while." Radcliffe and his friends are already clamoring at what we have done." "Mr. Scrivener, so long as the President sees no present danger, or other emergency, he is full of com- IV   .    THE LITTLE AMBASSADRESS.    115 plaints about me. But the moment trouble comes, he cries, ' Where is Captain Smith?' or, Captain Smith, do see to this business.' So it will be now, when he finds that he would doubtless have had his throat cut, or his brains clubbed, or his scalp talken, but for the course I have pursued. Yet he will make it a matter of complaint against me in England. However, that is neither here nor there. If he will not protect the colony, we must." "W hy would you detain these men?" "It may excite some salutary fear in Powhatt;an. At least, it will show him that we are no longer to be wronged with impunity."  The next day Scrivener entered Captain Smith's apartment, saying: "You were right, sir; Pow- hattan has sent to ask grace." "So soon! What grace?" "That his men be set at liberty. He says he' is your very good friend, and hopes you. will overlook the wrong which some of his rash and disorderly cap- tains have done in instigating their men to theft, and begs your acceptance of a few turkeys, as a token of his love." Very affectionate, and very innoceit! He did not send to Radcliffe?" "No, sir; his greetings are expressly and only to his dear friend Captain Smith, and - he honors me by the association -- Mr. Scrivener. Who do you think is his messenger? ' i,  "L Rawhunt?

The cunning old chief either intended a compliment, or thought he had sent a messenger whom wte should be sure to return. Would it not be well, Mr. Scrivener, to spurn the compliment and keep the lad? Suppose we lock him up, sir?" "A significant way of showing defiance." "Please put him under guard, then; and the tur- keys, too, Mr. Scrivener." Less than twenty-four hours had elapsed, when a private conference of the two gentlemen was inter- rupted by a soldier, who announced another embassy from Powhattan, and at; the same moment introduced the ill-visaged and deformed Rawhunt and the beau- tiful Pocahontas. The maiden entered in her usual quiet and confiding way, coaxing along a little cosset  deer which seemed shy of entering so strange a place.  "I have brought you a friend of mine, Captain Smithl,'-said she, frankly extending one hand while she patted her pet with the other. "See how tame she is. There! she nibbles out of my hand, - see!" looking up in his face. "You may call her Poca- hontas." Captain Smith had a gloomy and care-worn brow before she entered, and so had Scrivener. But every shadow disappeared when they saw this light-hearted and artless child. "Thank you," said Smith, taking her by the hand. "But there is only one Pocahontas."  "Only one real one. But you could call this one Pocahontas, in play you know; and that would make you think of the real one - away."   THE LITTLE AMBASSADRESS.   117 "You would like to have me call it so?" "Yes." * Then I will, to please you; but I can think of you vithout." "   O, I know you could; but then not so often. Now, when I go out in the evening, and look up through the trees and see the stars, I think of 'you, when I should n't perhaps if it were not for the stars." "But the stars, - how do they make you think of me?  "Why, when I see them, how can I help thinking of Captain Smith's God, who put them there? And do you suppose I don't think of Captain Smith then? Now, if you say to this little creature, ' Pocahontas!' and sihe looks up in your face,-there! see her, see her now, Captain Smith! - then do you suppose you won't think of the other Pocahontas? Be- sides-" "Captain Smith," interrupted Rawhunt, with an impatient gesture, "that deer is a present to you from Powhattan. I know not why his dauglhter--" Smith's ungracious look interrupted and somewhat disconcerted Rawhunt, but not so much as the look of the maiden. The bright light of her countenance and the unstudied ease of her attitude were gone. The child stood up an offended princess; the warrior slrunk to a culprit. She said nothing, but the araaze- ment and rebuke expressed in her large, dark eye and erect form were enough. Rawhunt, by the slightest sign, indicated a sense of his fault, and it received no further notice. "Besides, resumed Pocahontas, as though she had not been interrupted, " the little creature will remind    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6802-00000064"/> "8   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.  you of Powhattan, for he sent it and me to you as  signs of his love; and nmy men here have brought you a store of bread also from him. Accept all in I kindness, and believe men," she added, earnestly, "my ! father is your friend. Those who have stolen your  weapons he will punish."  "The little daughter of Powhattan is a peace- maker," said Srmith, turning to Scrivener. "He who made the stars," he replied, addressing the maiden, with a look of intense interest, - . lHe who made the stars said, LHappy are the peace- makers! '. "Happy! yes, Pocahontas will be happy if she make peace. Captain Smith's God said true. Pow- hattan's men have done wrong; but he asks that you would let them. go free." Smith gravely shook his head. Pocahontas turned to Scrivener, as if asking his in- tercession; for she knew that he was Smitl's friend, and that both were the chief men of the English. But Scrivener held his peace. After a moment's pause, Pocahontas gently laid her hand upon Smith's arm, and looked earnestly in his -eye, saying: "Have you not told me that what your God says is good?  "Yes."  "And that we should mind him?" Yes."                  .     ' "You told me something what was it? -that He says we must say about wicked folks. It was- it was -I don't think now; but it 'was in Our Father."                  . Smith was a little disturbed; but he readily and gravely replied: ' It is not because your father's sub- ; /   THE LITTLE AMBASSADRESS,   119 jects have trespassed against me that I do not forgive them, but because they do wrong to my brothers the English." "Yes, forgive, - that is it. I thought - I thought we ought to forgive those who do wrong. But Poca- hontas will learn. Rawhunt! speak your message." Powhattan bids me say," said the warrior, l; that the wrongs which have been done to your people have not been done at his bidding, but by the orders . of some of his captains who are unruly. He asks that you would therefore excuse him for the injuries, and let his subjects go, who did but obey their chiefs. Powhattan would not send to you the child whom he most loves, did he not love you. Let his men go free, and he will always love." "Yes, he will," interposed Pocahontas. "But you will send him the English boy again, -will you not? Powhattan loves him very much," - and her eyes moistened as she looked up. "Powhattan is a  It is too late for Powhattan to think of-                    ; Captain Smith spoke in an excited tone; but as he saw' those tearful eyes., he checked himself, hesi- tated, stopped, and then recommenced, saying calmly': 4 Mr. Scrivener, we can think of this matter; and Powhattan's daug'hter shall be gratified, if it can be." "The chief Opechancanough!" said a soldier, en- tering the room. The stately king of Pamunkey advanced with great respect, and entered his plea; assuring the two 'gentlemen of his sincere friendship, and utterly dis- avowing all connivance with the injuries done to the English. He added, that some of the prisoners were    <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6802-00000065"/> 120   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.  his friends and subjects, and earnestly entreated their  liberty.  "The request of Opechancanough is heard," said  Smith, coldly; and adding, with marked significance, "it will not be forgotten."  When the chief had gone, Captain Smith took   . "the king's dearest daughter" by the hand, and signing to Scrivener and " the most trustie messen- ger Rawhunt.," he walked silently into the esplanade of the fort, where he gave orders that the prisoners should be conducted under guard to meet him and his company in the little church. This done, a pray- '  er was offered, for what particular purpose does not appear. Captain Smith then addressed those who were present, saying: - "These men, the subjects of Powhattan, are my prisoners. I. seized them only because they were trying to seize me, and, probably, to take my life. They deserve punishment, perhaps death. Yet not a hair of their heads have I hurt. They are in my power. I can easily have them killed, that they trouble me no more. But I spare them. I let them go home to their wives and childrn. "It is not," turning to the prisoners, ' because I fear to take your lives. It is not because you do not deserve flogging, or hanging, or both. It is not be- cause the king of Pamunkey has desired me to let you go, nor because Powhattan has desired it, but  because the dear daughter of Powhattan has desired it. I give you to her. I owe Powhattan nothing.  I owe Opechancanough nothing. I owe to Poca- hontas my life.     .  "How can I refuse you," dropping his stern tone  , h i s stern tone ii\   THE YOUNG AMBASSADRESS.    121 for one of manly tenderness as he took the hand of Pocahontas, " how can I refuse the preserver of my life? Take them, my child. They are yours. You can give them to Powhattan if you choose, but I give them only to you. When your father's subjects cease to molest us, they tvill find that they have no better friend than Captain Smith." The little maid looked her gratitude and thanks as he spoke, and followed, with a step expressive of childlike joy, as he led her through the door of the church to the gate of the fort. Here the bows, ar- rows, and other effects of the prisoners, were restored to them; and they themselves were formally deliv- ered, with other suitable gifts, to "the king's dearest daughter, who led them, with a happy face and a bounding heart, to Werowocornoco. Scrivener alluded to Smith's, unfinished invective against Powhattan, with which he had begun to reply to Rawhunt's address.            - "'For nmy life," was his answer, "I would not be the one needlessly to expose a father's dishonor to a trustful and loving child. The man who could wan- tonly do it would deserve eternal execration. The child does not yet suspect her father's treachery and lies; and when the veil is torn away from the eyes of a creature so pure-minded and noble-hearted as she, God forbid that mine should be the hand to do it." The internal affairs of the colony demanded vigi- lance and correction no less than their external. The Indian offenders had no sooner been dismissed, tlhn it became necessary to discipline the faction of Radcliffe and Martin. These unprincipled men, like the former President, Wingfield, had indulged their own palates '-   11 '1    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6802-00000066"/> of, 122   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. at the expense of the workingmen and invalids of the  colony. They had put lock and key upon the public  stores, serving their own tables bountifully, and deal-  ing out to the sick and hungry their daily sustenance  only in return for so much value received. Such was their infamous conduct before the arrival of Nelson, and such it continued to be. The evil had become  intolerable. Smith and Scrivener now took vigorous measures against it, and did not rest until they had wrenched the keys of the public stock from these rapa- cious and shameless men, and forced them to their own proper proportion and quality of food. Thus there were the planting of corn, the rebuild- ing of their hamlet, the discipline of the Indians, the enforcement of common decency and common hones- ty upon Radcliffe, and the reloading of the Phoenix, all upon the hands of Smith and Scrivener at once. These things accomplished, Smith embarked, with fif- teen men, in a barge of between two and three tons burden, to explore ;the Mother of Waters," the Chesapeake. He dropped down the river in company with the Phoenix, which sailed on the 2d day of June, 1608. .I *! vi;!   CHAPTER    X. THE CORONATION. - GENTLEMEN AT WORK. THE*E was always trouble in Jamestown when John Smith was away. He fdund it so when he re- turned on the 21st of July. All those who had been left by Nelson were sick; and sick and well were full of wrath against the President, and ready for mutiny. He had again seized upon the public stores, again embezzled and wasted them in riotous indulgence; had been guilty of cruelty in his administration; and had tasked the colonists in building a house for his personal comfort, in the woods, where he might live undisturbed by the sufferings and complaints of others. The hearts of the colonists revived at the appearance / of Smith; and the violence of their rage was so far subdued by the supplies which he brought, and by his personal influence, that they were content with hav- ing Radcliffe merely deposed from office. But upon this they clamorously insisted; and also that Smith should be instated in his place, for he was the only man among them who could keep the settlement in order. He was bent upon further exploration; and again left for that purpose on the 24th, appointing Mr. Scriivener as his deputy during his absence, which was protracted unfit the 7th of September. During these two excursions, the wlole of the Chesapeake Bay had been explored, on either shore,    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6802-00000067"/> 124   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. to the mouth of the Susquehannah; the principal riv- ers, the Poconoke, the Patuxent, the Patapsco, the  : Rappahannock, the Piankatunk, the Elizabeth, and  the Nansemond, had been penetrated as far as circum- stances would allow; intercourse had been opened With various tribes; provisions had been purchased, or procured as amends for unprovoked hostilities; dangerous storms on the water, intense heat, and sick- ness had been encountered; a weary, disheartened, refractory crew had been soothed, encouraged, re- strained, and stimulated; many privations and suffer- ings had been endured; an excellent map--till in existence - of the entire Chesapeake Bay had been constructed; more than three thousand miles had been traversed; and three months of time and toil had been expended. One man,had died, and was buried on the shores of the Rappahannock. While at the mouth of this river, Captain Smith Was struck on the wrist by the poisonous thorn of a fish called the stingray. Within four hours he was in a condition hopeless of life. He selected ,the spot for his own burial, and at his order his grave was dug by his men. But the application of an oil, and the probing of the wound, by Dr. Russell, one of the party, effected a sudden recovery. Smith ate of the fish for supper. The place where this occurred is to this day called Stingray Point, in commemoration of the event. Wherever Captain Smith was in command, God was recognized and acknowledged. By daily relig- ious services, he kept alive in his own mind, and in tne minds of his men., a sense of dependence upon Divine protection, and of obligation for Divine mer- cies. Thus, throughout'this whole tour of exploration, t X                      THE CORONATION.      ;125 wherever the wanderers sought their natural rest, they joined in the social worship of God. The silence of the wilderness Was broken by the voice of their prayer, and the gloom of the forest by their hyrmn of praise. The wild men gathered around them, and listened with reverence; for, though they did not un- derstand the words, they could comprehend the act, of devotion; and they caught its spirit too, and some- times responded to the Christian's song by such sol- emn chants as they had learned in the great temple of Nature. There were many, just recovering from sickness, who crept feebly from their doors to welcome Smith  at his return; many who could only give him a fever- ish hand and a languid smile as he stood by their bedsides; 'and many, who had bidden him God-speed when he went away, gave him no greeting now, for they lay unconscious and mute in their graves. Arrangements had been made at Smith's last de- parture for none but necessary labor ini the colony during the heat of summer; consequently nothing of - importance had been effected except the gathering: of the crop, under the direction of Mr. Scrivener. Rad- cliffe, however, had found his private station and his vulgar rations so irksome, that he had endeavored to raise a mutiny; in consequence of which he was now still farther reduced, to the quarters and fare of a prison. Smith assumed the duties of his office as President on the 10th of the month, the third day after his return. He acted with his habitual vigor, erecting rew buildings which were needed, repairing the old, strengthening and altering the fort, and regularly drill- /     <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6802-00000068"/> 126   THE YOUTH OF THE. OLD DOMNION. ing in military exercises all who were not incapaci- tated by sickness.  Captain Newport now arrived, bringing a recruit to the colony of seventy persons; two of whom were Englishwomen, - Mrs. Forrest, and Anne Burras, her maid. Two others, were " ancient souldiers and valiant gentlemen, but yet ignorant of the businis," - Captain Richard Waldo and Captain Wynne. They were appointed, and duly sworn in, as members of the Council. But Captain Newport also brought some silly things from the Council in England, who fancied themselves -under the advices of the very man who had loaded their ship with worthless dirt-competent to judge of all the wants, the resources, the capabilities, and the geography of an infant settlement in a boundless wil- derness three thousand miles away. First, there were - a. party of Germans and Poles, sent to manufacture pitch, tar, potash, and glass, in a community where one farmer would have been worth them all, and where every hand and muscle was needed to supply subsistence. Second, there was a barge, constructed in five parts, in which the colonists were ordered to proceed as far as possible up some river flowing into the Atlantic; thence to carry it piecemeal on their shoulders over the mountains, there put it together, get into it, and just float down the westerly flowing streams into the Pacific! Third, there were a basin, a ewer, a bed, a bedstead, a chair of state, a suit of scarlet clothes, a cloak, and a crowzn, for Powhattan! Fourth, there was a special commission in Newport's pocket, authorizing him to act, in certain'cases, inde- pendently of the Council; and requiring him to bring   THE CORONATION.        -127 back either some certain information of the Pacific Ocean, or a lump of gold, or some one of the lost colony sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh, twenty-one years before!  Notwithstanding all the common-sense arguments which Smith urged against these preposterous schemes, the Council resolved to prosecute them. Indeed, com- mon sense had had very little 'to do with the whole colonial enterprise from its beginning. An insane passion for sudden wealth shaped the entire policy of the Company. When, however, the projects which Smith's judgment condemned and his soul loathed, as detrimental to the vital interests of the colony, were once determined upon, he did all in his power to forward their prosecution. The proud and wary Powhattan would not go to Jamestown to receive a crown, - not he! - the crown might come to him! Being himself a king, he would-  , not fail in kingly courtesy to a peer. He would there- fore wait eight days at Werowocomoco to receive that which, as. he was told, James' of England had sent him.  Newport, therefore, went, -- Mahomet to the mountain, -- and Powhattan was crowned! The ceremony,. too silly to be even laughable, does not deserve recital. It had two evil results, however, both of which Smith foresaw, and the latter of which he predicted,-it gratified the vanity of Newport, as * A colony of a hundred persons had been left on the island of Ro- anoke, by Captain White, under the auspices of Sir Walter Raleigh, in 1587, and were never heard of afterwards. One of their number, Eleanor Dare " gave birth to a female child, the first offspring of English parents on the soil of the United States. The infant was named, from the place of its birth, VIRGINIA Dare."    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6802-00000069"/> 128   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION, maste r of ceremonies, and inflated Powhattan with the idea that he was of great consequence in the esti- mation of the English. Newport now went to find corn, gold, Raleigh's colonists, and the Pacific! He took a hundred and twenty men, a pinnace, and all the boats but one, which, with eighty or ninety men, he left with Smith to serve the fort and load the vessel. He went C thir- tie myles ' above the Falls. Thence, three whole days of land travel, and yet found no corn, no gold, no Englishmen, and no ocean! He brought back his men, however, " halfe sicke, all complayning and tyred with toyle, famine, and discontent." This also agreed with what Smith had predicted.' Close upon the river's bank, about five miles below the settlement, the forest was ringing with the sounds of cheerful industry. The Anglo-Saxon, with his in- domitable enterprise, was there, humbling the princes of the woods. Huge pines which had stood, and towered toward heaven, and buffeted tempests, and  given shelter to the eagle and her young, long, long before he was born, had confessed his power, and fallen crownless at his feet. The work was yet in progress. A dozen axes were chipping asunder trees still standing, while others were lopping the branches of the fallen. Thirty Englishmen were scattered here and there in groups; some of them lustily a t work,- some of them lolling wearily upon the ground; some of them hardy, muscular men, accustomed to toil, - many of them evidently more familiar with the drawing-room and boudoir, than with the rough life of the wilderness. Near the water was a conical 5  .    GENTLEMEN AT WORK.      129 structure of boughs laid densely one over another, the extremity of each pointing downwards, and giv- ing shelter to various implements of labor. There were long two-handled saws, and huge mallets, and iron wedges, adzes, drawing-knives, &amp;c., besides mus- kets and pistols and swords, two kettles, a gridiron, and other coolting utensils. Near this wigwam a moderate fire was burning upon the ground, high over which was a stout horizontal pole, supported at either end by forked stakes, with a chain dangling from its centre. A young man sat against a tree within some twenty feet of the fire, his hands wrapped in bandages, and intent upon the motions of a companion, who was artistically feeling the edge of a large knife, his shirt- sleeves rolled to his shoulder, and his arms stained with blood. The latter had certainly a very savage and nurderous appearance, yet he was a very harm- less fellow. * You 'll do," said he, as he touched the edge for the last time with his thumb; and whistling a brisk march, he advanced to the carcass of a deer which hung from a neighboring tree, and cut from it several large slices of flesh with evident satisfaction. "That was a lucky shot of yours, Stimpson!" said the young man upon the ground. "It spares you, the while, from swinging the axe." ' Are n't yer a graceless fellow, Mr. Russel," said the other, pausing from his employment; " thinkin' o' nothin' but restin' and eatin'!  "Whew!" exclaimed Russel, "how canl you tell what a man thinks of before he tells you himself?" ' By his looks and actions.

If that is n't as much as to say that yer thinlkn' o' restin' and eatin', I should like to know?  "Well, I was."  "There, now, war n't I right?" "No: you said I was thinking of nothing, else." "An' I 'm a thinkin', Mr. Russel, that, instead o' scowlin' over yer blisters, yer oughter look bright and smart for feelin' that yer gettin' t be somethin' of a man.

"I don't scowl over my blisters, Stimpson," ex- claimed Russel with energy, and starting to his feet. "It was rather tough at first, but I glory in it now. By George! the Captain has made a man of me. Damn the rags!" said he, tearing the bandages from his hands; "' I '1 do no more nursing." ' Take care what yer say, Mr. Russel! Two bad words in one sentence; two cans of water for yer to- night!" "By Geo-  "Hist-st--st-      ..  ' Well, then; with all solemnity and propriety of speech, let me say, that this way of keeping a man from swearing is the funniest that ever entered man's  head. A punishment, and a d- a confounded dis- agreeable punishment too, and yet makes a man laugh. Captain Smith is a genius, an original, a none- such, decidedly. Think of his making a wood-chop- per of me! and really making me like it too! And of all things in this world, curing a man of, swearing!   GENTLEMEN AT WORIK.      31 St. James said you can guide a ship with a rudder, and a horse with a bit, but that no man can tame the tongue; but then that was before Captain Smith was born. Good by, Stimpson. Get me a good supper, man, for I 'm going to fell that tree." So saying, the young man walked up to where Captain Smith was briskly at 'work upon one side of 'a large tree, with a young "'gentleman" who was pecking awkwardly but good-naturedly with his axe upon the opposite side. Smith was cheering his part- ner with some considerate words of encouragement, as young Russel drew near and stood eying the prog- ress of the work. Smith soon suspended his blows, and, turning about, said in a cheerful voice, "Vell, Russel! tired out?" No, sir," said the young manwith a smile. "I have been resting a little while, and now I have come to ask for work." "That 's right,- that 's right, my man. But there 's work enough; no need of asking, surely!" :( No, sir. But we have been here -nearly a week, and there is one thing which I have not yet done, but should like to do it, sir, if you please." Ah! what is it?" "I have never felled a tree." "And you would like to fell this, my man? T'hat you shall, indeed, and with all my heart," putting the axe into the young man's hand, with a look of grati- fication and approval which went to, Russel's heart. "There is something in the sensation with which one brings down - But try it, try it, Russel: I cannot tell the thing in words." Russel gratefully took the axe, though it required a    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6802-00000071"/> 132   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD :DOMNION. minute or two before he could adjust his sore and  stiffened hands to the helve. Smith said a word com-  mending his resoluteness, when he swung his tool  with considerable skill and much energy into the scarp which Smith had made.  The tree required some fifteen minutes more of cutting, and Russel per- sisted manfully until arrested by Smith. ' Hold! said he. ' Beadle, stand aside now; let Russel finish it. Take the other side, Russel. This side is cut much beyond the centre; of course the tree will fall this way. When it does fall, take yourself aside a rod or two, lest it should get foul upon the stump and strike you. Cut away!" The huge trunk now began to' quiver perceptibly under the strokes of the axeman, - more, - more,- more. And now it swayed and leaned. Under the next stroke, the strong fibre of the wood cracked,- 'but a little, though. At the next, it shivered into splinters across the whole face, and the tall trunk lay slowly and reluctantly over a little way, but stopped, as if determined not to yield. The yoang woodsman sprang from his position. Smith glanced upward, and saw the long limbs of the tree clinging to the arms of a neighbor for support. "'Give it a little more top-weight, Russel. A few chips out, and it is done." The young man had hardly resumed his strokes, when the monster yielded with a groan which was heard far away, sunk faster and faster, tearing and crashing through the surrounding trees, till it fell with a thundering roar, and the ground quaked under the shock. Russel had traced the majestic descent of its proud head to the ground with awe; and when the  .          . .   GENTLEMEN AT WORK.      133 echo of its fall had subsided, he still stood, his axe poised, his eye fixed upon the prostrate giant which - he had laid low, motionless and silent. ' Well done, Russel!" exclaimed the President; "you have brought down one of the largest. How do you feel about it? Proud?" ' Feel?" exclaimed the young man, looking up as if waked from a trance. "Less than the least of all things!" and he dropped his axe. There was strong emotion in his face, and his lip paled and quivered as he continued,-in a husky voice: "Captain Smith, I never, never felt so little as at this moment. NVhat power, what pride, what centuries, are there! When it was toppling and falling, it gave me such an idea of strength and ruin, that I seem to myself nothing." "Young man!" replied Smith, with impressive seriousness, "you have learned a lesson. You feel as I thought you would. But mark the difference. There is bulk; here "- laying his hand upon Rus- sel's head - "is intellect. There is physical might; but it is laid low by the mightier and immortal mind which yoiz are. Let no spoiler bring you low." Although the sun was yet an hour above the hori- zon, the approach of evening was already perceptible beneath- the shade of a primeval forest. The signal was now given to cease from labor, and the men left their various stations for the hut of boughs which has been mentioned. Some carried the garments which they had laid aside; some, the tools with which they had been employed, and which they now carefully de- posited in their proper place. Then came the busi- ness of washing, which they had discovered was a great refreshment and a luxury. Their garments were 12    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6802-00000072"/> L34   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. resumed, and they gathered near the fire, a talkative, cheerful, hearty set, resting with right good-will from their toil, and waiting with the workingman's appe- tite for supper. They dropped themselves upon the ground in groups, or alone, as chance or caprice di- rected. Some were joking of the odd mischances and blunders of the day; some, gravely estimating the amount of clapboards already wrought out; and some of the few solitary ones solacing themselves with an English song. This continued until Stirnpson, who appeared to act. in the double capacity of cook and waiter, approached Captain Smith with washen face and hands, and presented him with the Book of Prayer. Every one now rose and stood uncovered, while the President read a short portion of Scripture, and all bowed the knee and made the responses as he recited the evening prayer for the day. A hymn was then sung, in which nearly every voice joined, and whose cheering inspiration every one seemed to feel. Then followed the evening meal, consisting of the venison which Stimpson had chanced to bring down that morning, and the new maize of the season, boiled in the unbroken kernel, previously divested of its trans- parent cuticle by soaking in a weak ley. The meal was served in most rustic style, but devoured with the keenest relish. The brisk conversation with which the repast was enlivened gradually subsided; and when at length every appetite was appeased, it ceased altogether, and the attention of every one was turned to Captain Smith, who held in his hand a paper. At. the same time Stimpson placed near him a bucket of clear, cold water fresh from a neighboring spring.   GENTLEMEN AT WORK.      135 The President cast his eyes gravely around the cir- cle. ' There is no necessity of my reading the names updn this paper," he said: "the delinquents, I per ceive, designate themselves." Twenty-eight heads turned quickly to survey their fellows. Two were bent towards the ground in slight confusion. ' I am glad that it is so," continued Captain Smith; "glad and thankful that men now blush for an of- fence against God in which no true gentleman will allow himself; men, too, who a week ago would have resented a rebuke for their fault. I thank all of you who are here to-night chargeless of profanity during the day, for the self-control which you have so soon acquired. The expedient to which I have resorted for your improvement has served, as it was intended, rather as a reminder than as a punishment. I take to myself no credit, therefore, for your purer habits of speech. The victory - and it is really one - has been your own; and again I thank you heartily.- Peperell! Russel!" The two men thus called took their station by the side of Stimpson. ' Take your turn, Peperell!" said the President. Peperell elevated his arm, while Stimpson dipped a can about the measure of a quart into the cool water of the bucket, saying to the President, "L How many, sir? ' "Five; I am sorry to say it," said. Smith, as he looked upon the record in his hand. "The last five, or rather the five last, I hope." Stimpson raised his dripping can as high in the r-    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6802-00000073"/> 136   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. air as he cozld reach., while with the other hand he opened the ample sleeve of the culprit. Slowly and steadily he poured in the cold stream, which, flowing down to the shoulder, dispersed itself thence, and ap- peared trickling from different vents below. The man did not seem much moved by the application, though his countenance indicated a wholesom e degree of mortification. But under the second he cringed; and when the third, lid fourth, and fifth followed in rapid succession, his contortions and orimaces, al- though he resolutely held his arm in position, had become so ludicrous, that the whole company were in an .uproar. "I 'll be d-- I hope:, Captaiy Smithi," said he, rub- bing his' drenched arm, and with a slight chattering of his teeth, --"I hope, sir, that this will be the last. I 'll try, sir, by I mean, I 11 try hard, sir." I see you must try ha'rd, Peperell; the dirty words seem to grow on your tongue. But you can keep them back, and you zuill; I knzotv you will, my man. You will master yourself. - Russel!" Poor Russel! ,Captain Smith's last words beside the tree had impressed him deeply; and he had fallen into so serious and thoughtful a mood, that the ordeal was peculiarly trying. He received, however, but two cans of water, for the two oaths charged to his account. The routine of the'day was now over. Sentries were posted for the night. The men wrapped them- selves in cloaks or blankets, lay down in the open air upon theirpallets of tender and fragrant pine boughs, with their muskets by their sides, and were soon in, profound sleep. Such was Captain Smith's fashion of employing *-i- *; ;^   GENTLEMEN AT WORK.      137 time and strength, instead of crowning savages, and ransacking a strange and trackless wilderness for lost menr gold, and the antipodes. In this his good sense is not more noticeable, than his skill and success in managing the crude, lawless, and hair-brained thirty whom he took from the fort to make clapboards in the woods. Many of them were ' younger sons,' effeminate, utter strangers to manual labor and to dis- cipline. But Smith - tempering the authority of the magistrate with the suavity of the gentleman, and with the spirit and style of a fellow-laborer, swinging the axe himself, and good-naturedly stimulating the tender-handed- had contrived to invest the hard la- bor of the forest. with an air of romance which caught the fancy of all; and in a few days he had brought his gentlemen to be efficient, and even merry-hearted workmen. Nothing, perhaps, was more remarkable in this young father of Virginia than this, --is famili- arity did not breed contempt. He mingled with his men in the woods as a friend; he chatted and joked with them as a fellow; yet all felt his intellectual and moral ascendency, -- all deferred to him as a magis- trate. His original device against profaneness -a most singtlar combination of fun and punishment, of good-nature and grave authority-- -wrought like a charm upon men who would have been unmoved by omilies, and none the better for flogging or the bilboes. Returning to the fort, Captain Smith found it ne- cessary immediately to procure food. For this pur- pose, he went up the Chickahominy 'with two barges. But the Indians were now in no humor for trade. Be- ing thus compelled to work upon their fears, he told 12* /    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6802-00000074"/> 138   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. them that he had an old score to settle with them, - his own capture, and the murder of Robinson and Emry. This iintimattion, backed, by men and muskets, brought them to terms, and they freighted both barges with provisions. When the question of prosecuting the schemes of Newport and the Company was before the Council, Newport pledged himself to obtain twenty tons of corn on his tour of discovery, and as much also from Powhattan in return for his coronation. Smitl had expressed doubts that; these expectations would be realized. On his tour, as has been stated, Newport obtained nothing; from- Powhattan he received four- teen bushels! These failures, in addi:tion to that which took place when Newport was first overreached in trade by Powhattan, only demonstrated, at New- port's cost, the wisdom and sagacity of Smith, who now again appeared before Jamestown with supplies, which all needed and welcomed, but which no one else could obtain. All these occurrences so wrought upon Newport's spleen, that he plotted with Radcliffe, who of course owed Smith a grudge, to depose him from the' Presidency, and even to exclude him from the fort, upon the bald pretence that he had left it without leave from the Council. But they had wrong- ly measured both themselves and him. The meshes of their toils were spiders' webs. In the words of the original narrative, " their homes were much too short." Smith was too strong in his own manliness, and too strong in the esteem and affection of most of the colo- nists, for such feeble-minded envy to contend with. He was full of indignation at this attempt, and was about to send the ship home without Newport, that   j): VEXATIONS.             139 he. might know, by the experience of a year, the hard- ships and privations of colonial life. But Newport made suitable apology, and Smith was appeased, and forgave. It is hardly possible for us to award to Smith that meed of respect and admiration which is his due, because it is hardly possible for us to estimate the variety and weight of burdens which none could shoulder but himself, the hindei:ances which beset him, the enmity and rascality which balked his best endeavors. One thing is certain, however,--he never flagged under the most harassing 'annoyances. In addition to other difficulties, he was now contending against secret villany, which greatly hindered the mercantile prosperity of the Company. Newport and his sailors traded on their own account, through their private factors or accomplices in the settlement. These pilfered the tools, the powder, the shot, the pike-heads, and other vendible effects belonging to the Company, which they secretly exchanged " with the salvages for furres, baskets, mussan'akls, young beasts, or such like" ; and these commodities they again " exchanged with 'the saylers for butter, cheese, beefe, porle, aqua vitce, beere," and other ship-stores of the Company, and which  they would fain was all sent them by their friends" in England. Thus, "though the Company got no furs from Virginia, vet the master [Newport] got so many by this indirect meanes as he confessed to have sold in England for thirty p6unds." To such an extent was this pecula- tion carried, "that, within six or seaven weakes, of two or three hundred axes, chisels, hows [hoes], and pickaxes, scarce twentie could be found." Thus the    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6802-00000075"/> "O   THE, YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Company received no returns, save the avails of Smith's honest and indefatigable toil, and were at the same time freely swindled by their own servants. So completely was the ship stripped of her stores by this abominable traffic, that Smith, out of his meagre supplies, was obliged to furnish three hogsheads of corn to victual her homeward. The Company had reason to complain; but they complained only of their faithful servant. Yet he would not desert their service, though he manfully and keenly retorted their complaints.* It was a relief when Newport was gone, although there were two hundred colonists to be fed, - eighty- nine of whom were lame and sick in consequence of his journey of discovery, - and they were reduced, after victualling the ship, to a pint of corn a day to a man.  In addition to this, the new-comers were nearly all mere consumers, - fifty-six of the seventy being gentlemen, tradesmen, glass and potash makers, boys and women.  Captain Smith sent home with Newport the late President, Radcliffe, " a poore coun- terfeited imposture now called Sicklemore, least the company [at Jamestown] should cut his throat" The slender harvest of the colonists had been seri- ously injured by imperfect shelter, and the favorable time for purchasing the newly gathered harvest of the Indians had been squandered by the moonshine adventures of Newport. In addition, it was evident that the Indians were unwilling to supply their wants. Under these circumstances, Captain Smith was seri- * Smith's letter to the Cpuncil in England is contained entire in Simms, and an abstract of it may be found in Iillard. ^  '  " f' ; IIS   VEXATIONS.       141 ously apprehensive of famine, and now devoted his whole energies to avert it. He went upon repeated excursions to purchase corn. They were successful only to a limited degree; and only by resorting to threats, and even to some violence, after persuasion had been hried in vain. Powhattan had issued posi- tive orders to his subjects not to sell their corn to the English. Winter had set in. The ground was frozen hard, and covered with snow. Yet Smith and the men who accompanied him -wre obliged to sleep in the open woods. To keepithemselves alive, they would clear away the snow, build a generous fire upon the spot, remove the embers, and thus provide a warm bed for a while. When the ground grew cold, they would wake up, make another fire, and have'a warm bed again. Thus did they make shift for many a cold night; yet they "were always in health, lusty, and fat." Notwithstanding hardships and ill success, Smiith was ilot discouraged; but he resolved, through the necessity of the , upon an- other and bold expedient.     cS About this time occurred the first . ish mar- riage in Virginia, - John Laydon with "A ne Burras. %N    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6802-00000076"/> CHAPTER    XI. THE ANGEL JBY NIGHT. - SINGLE COMBATS, - PEACE.- ANARCHY. IN one of the most spacious huts of the royal vil- lage of Werowocomoco, and but a short distance from the bank of the river, a party of nineteen Eng- lishmen were gathered( around a generous fire on the morning of the 14th day of January, 1609. They had just partaken of a bounteous breakfast of veni- son, turkeys, and maize, which Powhattan had pro- vided with his usual liberality. The ground was covered with snow, and the ice extended nearly half a mile into the river, at less than musket-shot from which point lay the English pinnace and two barges, having o: board t-venty-eight men, in plain sight from the loor of the hut. The snow-clad pine-tops had glistcl,' but a little while under the rays of the sun, wh. the English finished their meal. They were all stout men, and stout-hearted too; or they would not have volunteered as they had done to enter the lion's dlen, knowing that he thirsted for their blood. They all seemed in good spirits, except three or four drowsy ones who had kept the night-watch. It is almost needless to say that the whole party were armed, and that Captain Smith was one of their number. They had arrived on the 12th. The next day had *,   THE ANGEL BY NIGHT.      143 been consumed in an unavailing talk between S:mith and Powhattan, which consisted chiefly of reproaches on the part of the chief that his " friend " should have come with an armed retinue, and on the part of the other that his " friend " produced no corn, after hav- ing invited him thither under promise of a boat load. Just before receiving the invitation, Smith had deter- mined upon the excursion for the purpose of attempt- ing the capture of Powhattan, as the only means of procuring food for the colony, and as a security for his own life. Powhattan had sent the invitation expressly for the purpose of compassing his death ; and of this Smith, in addition to what he knew before of Powhattan's general hostility and. designs, had received positive information just after leaving James- town. The chief also had received positive, infor- mation of Smith's purpose, through, some traitorous Germans whom he had sent to build a house which his Indian "friend." had requested. Thus singu- larly were they situated, each knowi:ng the hostile intent of the. other, each supposing his own int;ent unknown, and each adopting the speech and cour- tesies of friends. "It is useless," said Smith, as his men gathered closer to the fire, " to dally longer with this suspicious old chief. We must do our best to seize him to-day, if we would save our pe ^le from starvation andi our- selves from massacre."  "We only await your orders, sir," said John Rus- sel. "Iave you any plan of proceeding?" "I see no chance for stratagem. Powhattan is too much upon his guard. He will soon be here for an- other talk. You only must remain with me, Mr.    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6802-00000077"/> "4   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Russel. The rest of you ivill now retire, and act under the directions of Seigeant Pising. You, Ser- geant, ywill station your men according to your dis- cretion, only at such a distance from the house as not to excite fear. In the course of an hour, set some of the Indians to breaking the ice, and signal to Lieutenant Percy to Work the boats ashore. Then advance with all who can be spared, surround the hut, and we will take Powhattan away by force. In the mean time, ][ shall engage him in conversation." 5With the exception of Russel, the men now left, and. soon after Powhattan made his appearance; the two foes saluting each other with all show of con- fidence and good-will. The chief was accompanied by the " two handsome young women " who, for the time; enjoyed the honor of sitting by his side upon occasions of state. The conference of yesterday was soon resumed. Powhattan was strenuous on two points; first, that he should have swords in exchange for corn; second, that Smith should send all his arms on board the boats. It was only his own and his peoples' dread of English weapons which deterred him from attempting the life of his "' friend " at any moment; reasoning, as he justly did, that the vital- ity of the colony was centred in Smith. The latter affirmed that he had no swords to spare, and that the carrying of arms-was as much a matter of course with his men, as with the Indians when they visited Jamestown.  Powhattan urged that' he could not persuade his people to bring corn, they were so afraid of guns, and insisted that the presence of armed men was a very dishonorable reflection upon his royal friendship.   THE ANGEL BY NIGHT,      145 "Only get your guns and swords out of the way," said he, " and you shall have plenty of corn." ' You might as well ask me to deprive myself and my men of our clothes," was the reply. '"Besides, we never do harm with our weapons, except we re- ceive bad usage." "No one refuses to lie at my feet, or do what I demand, but you.  I asked Captain Newport for swords, and he gave them to me. I asked him to send his guns out of sight, and. he did it. And yet you, to whom I have been kinder than to any one, refuse me both!? ' Powhattan knows that I have but one God, and should also know that I have but one king. I pro- fess to be your friend, not your subject. Captain Newport may obey your orders, if he will; but Cap- tain Smith cannot." "You call Captain Newport father,9 and you call me 'father'; but I see, in spite of us both, you will do what you will." ' I do indeed call you father'; but; the small care you have of such a child has, caused me to look well to myself." Many other words passed between the two, but all to the same effect. However, a bargain was made between them, by which Powhattan agreed to give eighty, bushels of corn for a copper kettle which he greatly coveted, While this was going on, the break- ing of the ice and the movement of the boats became known to Powhattan, as was also the fact that his own men were in readiness to secure and murder Captain Smith, At the same time, Smith and Rus- sel were beguiled into conversation by the two young 13    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6802-00000078"/> "6   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. beauties, left there purposely to amuse them, who became suddenly agreeable upon the comparative merits of sky-blue beads and corn. A little time had been spent in this way, when Smith found to his alarm that they four were the only occupants of the hut, Powhattan having slipped quietly away. A glance through the door revealed that they were sur- rounded by arfied warriors, and that his own body- guard were operating near the shore for the advance of the boats. His countenance, even in its most composed state, had an unusual expression of martial severity and defiance; but at this triple discovery it underwent a change which made the wood-nymphs scud. There was but a moment for action. The two men sprang at once upon  the naked devils" without. At the first shot, the foremost tumbled in heaps, and the rest fled in a panic, so that Smith and Russel readily made their way to their companions. After a little while there came " an ancient orator," bringing a great bracelet and a chain of pearls, which l he presented to Captain Smith, saying, with an air of the greatest ingenuousness: "Powhattan sends these presents to assure you of his love. H-e has fled because he fears your guns, and because he knows you mean to bring more from your boats when the ice is broken. You was alarmed because his war- riors surrounded your house. But you was wrong. Our werowance placed them there for the love he bears you, that they might keep the wicked ones of our people from stealing the corn which he had given you. You have hurt some of them with your guns; but Powhattan knows that the injury which comes   THE ANGEL BY NIGHT.     I 147 by mistake should not. separate friends. Therefore he sends you greetings and presents, and messages of love. And now, see! the ice is broken; your boats can come to the shore. lHe wishes, therefore, that you would send your corn on board, and your guns too, if you desire his company." "When Powhattan was not with me, replied Captain Smnith, "I supposed that jhis warriors in- tended mischief. How can I doubt his love? Pow- hattan has the great heart of a great king, when he says that even bloody mistakes should not separate friends." "You see,' said the orator, " that our people are bringing baskets for your corn. Let your men take it to yqur boats. I will set a guard over their guns while they do it." "See to your arms, men! ' exclaimed Smith ; and the men instantly made a reiovement which showed the ancient that they were ready to u1se them. "Wvhen we buy corn of Powhattan,"' continued Smith, his servants should carry it to our boats. We will guard their, armis while they do it." The "goodly well-proportioned fellolws, grim as devils --so the narrative, with odd inconsistency of words, styles them--instantly took the hint, laid down their bows and arrows, and bore the corn to the boats on their shoulders. By this time the tide had ebbed, and left the barges aground, so that Smith and his guard were persuaded to return to their quarters. The Indians wlere all complaisance and hospitality. They spared no pains to promote the comfort and pleasure of the English. Out of doors there were such sports as the season    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6802-00000079"/> "8   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. permitted, and the ample building occupied by the guests was a scene of varied and unrestrained hilar- ity. The females joined nerrily in the dance, and performed well their part to allay the jealousies and secure the confidence of the strangers. Thus passed the day. The sun went down. The fire glowed and crackled, and gave out its cheerful light and its cheering influ- ence, as generous winter-fires always do. Sounds of unwonted glee came from the neighboring wigwams, where the youth of both sexes were making merry; a few "' well-proportioned devils" mingled with the English in frank and easy fellowship; black-eyed coquettes, with flowing tresses and furs negligently adjusted, glided around the fire, practising glances and smiles and attitudes upon their guests, while their more shy and unpractised companions huddled near the door, - some shaking the fresh snow from their moccasons, some just retreating to tell what they had seen.  Every human face and sound betokened unbounded and unsuspicious friendship on the part of the Indians, and contentment on the part of the whites. But the winld whistled through the crevices of the hut, and surged dole- fully through the pine and the cypress of the forest. Neither moon nor stars were to be seen, for the sky was overspread with clouds. It was a dark, dark night,--as dark as it can be when the ground is sheeted with snow. Captain Smith's attention was attracted to a little maiden, one of the group gathered about the entrance. She was noticeable for being so much younger than the 'est, - apparently not; more than six or eight   THE ANGEL BY NIGHT,     149 years of age, -but particularly for the earnest and meaning way in which she pd4sistently followed Smith with her eyes wherever he moved. Perceiv- ing this, he improved a leisure moment to beckon to her, holding in his hand a little toy as a lure. The child instantly, but timidly, approached; and, as she received the bawhle, adroitly slipped into his hand a little ornament of glass, saying,) "Let the white chief come to the old oak." ' Then, apparently engrossed with her toy, she ran back to the doorway, lingered' a  moment in the throng, folded her scant mantle of fur over her bosom, and disappeared. Smith held in his hand the only ornament of the kind -a simple brooch which he had given among the savages, and knew it to be a token from Pocahontas. The token, the message, the singular manner in which each was delivered, excited his alarm. It was evi- dent that some exigency demanded his immediate and cautious attention. The difficulty was to escape from the building unobserved. To pass by the door was out of question. Fortunately, upon one side of the hut was an aperture, about half the height of a man, serving as a window whenever occasion might require. It was now closed by matting and skins, and. the glare of the fire-light was full upon it. Cap- tain Smith immediately communicated with Russel, by whose assistance a few of his men were arranged to screen the window while he made his exit and until his return. Making his way through the dark- ness, with his hand upon his pistol, lie soon reached an oak, remarkable for its position and age, at a little distance in the rear of the hut. "Captain Smith!" whispered a trlemulous voice; 133    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6802-00000080"/> 150   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. and he could just discern a small figure gliding from behind the tree. "Pocahontas! is it possible!"  The maiden made no reply; but, clinging to his arm in an imploring attitude, burst into tears. ' Speak, child.! Tell me, are you in trouble?" But she only clung the closer to him, trembling like a frighted bird, and sobbing as though her heart would break. ( There, there, my dear one!" as he spread his short mantle upon the snow. He gently seated her upon it by his side, and, supporting her as if she had been his own child, he continued: "Taize your own time to tell me ; but be sure nothing shall harm you now. Poor, trembling thing! Be quiet now, if you can. You are safe, child; you are safe. Who' has dared. to fright you so? Dear child, you have done right to come to me. You knew I would protect you. Yes, yes, that was right?"; and he wiped away her tears, as she looked up and tried in vain to speak. So she sobbed upon his shoulder again for a min- ute, until she became somewhat composed, when she grasped his hand and exclaimed: "Fly, fly, Captain Smith! you tmust fly. They will kill you!" "Me! O, it is for me, is it, - not yourself?" "O no, no, no! not myself! They will kill you ." But who, child? "Powhattan!" and again she fell to weeping bit- terly. Well, do not weep."

Would you have her dance when they are shaking the English hatchet over your head? Is Pocahontas a wolf?"' "Powhattan has not deceived me,' replied Smith, hoping to assuage her grief. But when she pressed him, he was obliged to confess his meaning to be merely that the chiefs hypocrisy had been discovered. "But," he continued, " there is no danger. I am on my guard. Powhattan tried to kill me t;c-day; but I took care of myself." ' To-day tried!" exclaimed Pocahontas. Smith began to narrate the attempt of the morn- ing; but she interrupted him, saying vehemently: Enough, enough! I do 'ot wish to know. Besides, there is no time to spare. There is a great plot against you to-night, and you must fly." ' Well, child, what is the plot? and why must I flee?"

"We will take care of that." '"But," she continued, not heeding the in terrup- tion, " if they cannot, Powhattan will come wnith all his great warriors, and then they will Mill. This is the plot, and I beg you to go away." ' Now that my little preserver has told me, I shall take care. Did you come from where Powhattan and his warriors are?  "Yes. I overheard him tell them just before the sun went down n; and as soon as it was dark I came." "And have but just come?" ' "A little while ago.'" "You have been all this while on the way?" ' Pocahontas did run" said the child, in her sim- plicity, not perceiving that Smith only wished to judge of the distance. ' Alone?" "Yes, alone. I dared not have any one." "So far, -so cald,--so dark,- and alone!" exclaimed Smith. "Why did you not send?" "No one would. dare to come. Powhattan would kill any one -who should tell you." - ( But you did send some one to me," giving her the brooch. "' Yes.

God prompted the -pagan chld -to perform his purposes of deliverance. The service was rendered with a cleerfuli heart. It was her first lesson in the book of the knowledge of God.  As she went on his errands to the strangers, she was on her way to the One Fold to which she was a stranger. They Awere 'her first steps toward the Good Shepherd, who was thus drawing her to him- self; and swho, before long, folded her in his arms and carried her in his bosom,-ll her priceless and eternal reward for chllildhood's labor of love. Again involiing the 'blessing of God upon the heroic protectress of his life, Smith thoughtfully , returned to his companions. Tle fact;s were as Pocahontas hadl stated. The feast was provided, but the, plan was foiled. All nigh t long Powhattan, by means of successive spies, sought opportunity to attack the English with his whole force ; but at no moment could he venture, for at no moment could he find them off their guard. At flood tide in the morning the English departed, receiving and rendering back all the outward cour- tesies of friendship. They turned their boats up the river to Pamunkey, the residence of Opechancanough. The same hypocrisy and the same hostility'awaited  ! them there; for Powhattan, exasperated by lfis own failure, had instantly issued orders to all his subjects to kill Smith. They were received -with all hospi- tality. Upon a day appointed for the sale and pur- chase of co:rn Smith, with fifteen men, met Opechan- \    SINGLE COMBATS.       155 canough at. his d-elling, in presence of forty or fifty of his warriors. While the two principals were conversing, Alr. ,ssel suddenly gave the startling intelligence that the house was surrounded by seven hundred armed savages. Smith's men were .brave, and had volunteered upon a service whichll they knew to be full of danger; but at this news their hearts shrank within them. Perceiving its effect, Smith with a composed voice addressed a few words to them in English, which revived thleir natural cour- age, and they promptly signified. that they were ready to obey him to the death. He then turned boldly to the chief. 'I Opechancanough! you need not think that I am blind. With all your craft, you have not enough to cover a snare so cunninly that I cannot see it. Do I not know what: you are about' You intend to murder me. Do it, if you can. You shall have a fair chance. You see that island. Now let each of your menl around the house bring a basket of corn. For each basket I will lay down its value in copper. The copper and the corn, your men and mine, shall be the stake between us. Go now with me alone to the island. Talke what weapons you please.

Then you will have proof of my love."    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6802-00000083"/> / 156   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. He had a great present at- the door for his guest,- two hundred arrows upon the bow-strings of archers in ambush. Of this Smith was not aware; but of the chiefs murderous intention he w;as sufficiently certain. His resolution was instantly taken, for his blood was up. Opechancanough was much the taller and the stouter man, and his warrior attendants were ranged on either side of him. Smith ran, his eye from his coronet'of feathers to his beaded moccason, and  again from moccason to coronet, bounded upon him like a panther, seized his tufted hair, dragged him at a stride from the nmidst of his body-guard, and pre- sented a pistol at his breast. Holding back the chief's head by its scalp-lock, he looked terribly in his face for an instant, and then gave vent to his wrath: "Lie me no lies, you rascal! Come along!" So saying, he dragged him. to the door of the hat, and:in that humiliating position held him in the gaze of his people. Struck with horror at such a sacrilege upon the person of their king, and with awe of the man who had dared it, they instantly threw aside their weapons. "Pamunkeys!" exclaimed Smith, "I once made a vow to be your friend till you should force me to be your enemy. 1 have kept it; and because I am peaceable, you seek to kill me. But draw one drop of blood from me or my men, or steal from me a bead or a bit of copper, and I will not cease to bleed you so long. as there is a Pamunkey vein to bleed. I am not in a Chickahominy mud-hole to-day. You have promised to load my boat with corn. Load, or I will load it with your carcasses. Still, if you prefer to trade as friends, and your ling here 'prefers it, so   SINGLE COMBATS.       157 be it. In that case he shall be free; for I come neither to hurt you or him. Take your choice."' They made a discreet choice, and brought supplies with alacrity and in abundance ; upon which their king was released. Yet not three hours afterwards an attempt was made upon Smith's life by fifty select warriors at once, as he was sleeping alone, overcome with fatigue, Roused by their too pre- cipitate movement, and but half awrake, " he betooke him straight to his sword and target," and, with the help of some of his careless and scattered guard, drove the assailants from his house. Opechanca- nough apologized, and Smith affected to be satisfied. The rest of the day was passed in all friendship, - in exchange of presents, in feasting and sports; the In- dians preferring to make a virtue of necessity, rather than contend longer and hopelessly against so watch- ful and daring a foe. The last flurry with the Pamunkeys was hardly over, when Captain Smith was startled by the arrival, of M:r. Richard Wyffin from Jamestown. He brought a message, which he delivered to Smith privately, that the men upon whose discretion he depended for the care of the fort during his absence, and for, his succor in case he should need it, were. dead, and that his immediate return was necessary. No one had dared to venture upon this mission but himself, and he had undergone incessant perils on his way; hav- ing been rescued from death at Werowocomoco only by the vigilance, artifices, and large bribes of Poca- hontas. Mr. Scrivener, Captain WTaldo, Anthony Gosnold, a brother of the deceased navigator, and eight others, had been drowned by the swamping of " , ^    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6802-00000084"/> 158   THE YOUTH- OF TIlE 6LD DOMNION. their boat in the river near the fort. Lest the knowl- edge of this calamity should depress his men, and thus embolden the savages to new assaults, Smith enjoinedsecrecy upon Wyffin, and disguised his own grief. At night, he went on board his boat wi4h his men, and took his course imm-ediately for Jamestown ; having first sent Mr. Crashaw and Mr. Ford, with a small party, across the country. He arrived at tlhe fort about the 1st of February, after an absence of six weeks; having purchased four hundred and seventy- nine bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of deer- suet. Although much of the grain in store was ruined, by- neglect, during the absence of Smith, yet it was found that, with these new supplies, they had food enough to sustain the colony until the next harvest. The. whole energies of the settlers were now demanded, by their resolute Presideiit, in labors for the thrift and comfort of the community. There were some forty willing and industrious men; but the other hundred and fifty were restive and refractory. They plainly signified that both labor and discipline were unbefit- ting their pretensions as " gentlemen '"; and that they would stoutly resist the,enforcement of either. Noth- ing could rouse Smith's indignation more thoroughly and dangerously than conceited laziness and insubor- dination. He told the "gentlemen" that he had au- thority in their case; that, in virtue of the letters patent, the Council would enforce the law of labor equally and indiscriminately upon all not disabled by sickness; that, by the recent swamping of their boat, the Council now consisted only of Captain Wynne and himself, the President; and that no able-bodied man   SINGLE COMBATS.      159 among them should eat unless he performed his quota of work. Of honest labor or starvation they were free to make their election. Smith's resoluteness was kinown.; and the " gentlemen" fell into the ranks of work- men. Six hours; of labor a day was his very moderate requisition; the rest of the time the men might pass in such harmless recreations as they might choose. They were divided into companies of ten or fifteen; to each company was allotted a section of labor; and the taskls were performed, for every attempt to evade or slight them was -in vain under the eye of such a master. As the result of this discipline, "in three months they had made a considerable quantity of tar, pitch, and potash; produced a sample of glass; dug a well of sweet water iii the fort; built twenty houses; new-covered the chulrch ; provided nets and weirs for fisting; and built a blockhouse on the isthmus of Jamestown, in which a garrison was stationed to trade with the Indians, and which no one was allowed to pass without an order from the P]resident. An- other blockhouse was also erected and garrisoned on Hog Island; thirty or forty acres of land were dug and planted; trees were felled; and clapboards and wainscoting were manufactured." The Dutchmen sent to build a house, for Powhattan had not only revealed the plan for his capture,--a revelation of which Captain Smith himself was still unsuspicious - but; had perfected their treason by procuring, for the chief, English ar-ms and anmmuni- tion, by leaching his nLen to use thelm, and even ly plotting with him for the murder of rSmith. They had a few confederates in the fort, through whom they received swords, pike-heads, guns, powder, and shot, which were stored in the armory of Powhattan. /     <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6802-00000085"/> 160   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. About a mile from Jamestown, and in the deep shadows of the forest, stood a building which had been erected for experiments in the manufacture of glass. It was a convenient!lace of rendezvous for the Dutchmen, and their colleagues in the fort. One day, a short time after the return of the ex- pedition fronm Verowocomoco and Pamunkey, there was a gathering in this building. There were thirty- five Indians there, hideously painted and fully armed. Their commander w;s as the chief of a'neighboring , tribe, the Pashiphays., a remarkably tall .and muscu- lar man, a tributary to Powhattan. With them was Francis, one of the traitor Dutchmen, disguised as an Indian. There were also one Bentleyv, and a Swiss named Volday, both belongincg to the fortl who had met Francis and his Indians by appointmelnt. These th&amp;ee had just arranged with IPashiphay a plan. for leading Captain Smith into an anambusIl; for which purpose the Indians had been lurkinga, about the fort two or threes days. We will not attempt to specify the plan, for the best of reasons, .--we know not what it was. But no sooner was it alrranged, than it was disarranged by the entrance of an Indian scout-, -who reported that Captain Smith had just left the fort with soldiers, and was coling in the direction of the building. The lwhole party scattered as though a bomb-shell had fallen in their midst. Half an hour afterwards, Smith with his men ap- proachled. Having cautiously stationed them around the building, he entered the door alone. Seeing no one, he sought 'around for Francis, of whose arrival and treasonable friendship with Powhalttan he had just received information.   SINGLE COMBATS,       161 "The bird has flown,' said he, as he returned and called his men around him.' He stood for a moment in a musing attitude, revolving whatt next to do. '"The fellow must have some accomplice in the fort,"' obserNved Ensign Laxon. "To be sure!" replied the President; " some one who does the stealing for him ";--. for the Dutchmen were procuring weapons for Powhattan ; and that one of them was pronwling about in disguise was all that Smnith yet knew. "Remain here wit;h the men, Mr. Laxon," he conltilnued. "Conceal yourselves as much as possible, but keep your eyes and ears open. The fellowT may return.' If you catch the least glimpse of him, take him; alive, if you can,-- but take him r." l" ]low' long, sir '??

In the mean time, after a circuitous flight, P'ashi"- phay had rallied his men, about forty in number, and left them in ambush less than half a mile nearer to the fort, while he went himself to reconrnoitre. Fortune favored his designs. He had not golle far, when the sound of a footstep caught his ear. Instantly crouch- ing down, he listened, and perceived, upon a repe- tition of the-sound, that it was the step of a solitary person and a whte man. This perplexed the savage for a moment; for he could not believe that, when the ill-temper of his people towards ,the English was so well known, any one of them would venture into ":    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6802-00000086"/> 162   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION,       ' the forest unattended. But his eye -brightened, and even glowed with exulting eagerness, as his second  t thought suggested that there was on ^ white man who  t would dare to do it. Creeping along with the soft tread of a cat, and flitting from bush -to tree in the direction whe;nce the wanderer was approaching, he soon caught sight of a plume, which he recognized at once as Captain Smith's. A second look revealed the features and form of the very man whose life he i most desired to take, striding along the trail which letkto the fort, and armecd only with a sword. His 5? uat this unexpected sight and his certainty of secur- ing his prize were so great, that he could hardly re- strain the shout of triumph which rose instinctively to his lips. 'With the greatest effort he checked it; and stooping down, he acjusted an arrow upon his bow, and slowly rose to his aim. The shaft was drawn to its ,head by one of the best marksmen and strongest arms- in Powhattan's dominions. I Tever did archer have a fairer mark than was the breast of the unsus- pecting Englishman before the weapon of Pashiphay. The life of his formidable foe was in his hands. But his hands were :in the hand of a AIightier. The sav- age suddenly lowered his bow and arrow, for he thought of his men, and of the prowess of Smith. One arrow might fail, - forty were better. Step- ping theref6re from the coppice upon the narrow footpath, his weapon carelessly suspended in his hand, he stood in full, view of Smith, but with his eyes in another direction, as if intently watching for some object concealed in the forest. Captain Smith was startled -by his sudden appearance, and paused. But perceiving the abstracted. attention of a chief t   SINGLE COMBATS.       163 whom he immediately recognized, (and to whom he had been under essential obligation during his cap- tivity, he felt no alarm. Resumingi his walk, there- fore, he attracted the notice of the Indian, -whose countenance at once lighted up with a pleasant smile of welcome; although withl one hand lie immediately pointed to the forest, and with the other made a sign for silence. Smith at once understood that ]Pashi- phay was on the tlack of game ; an opinion confirmed by the manner in whicli he carried his weapons. As the two silently approached each other, the Indian spoke in a whisper: ' I am glad to see my ftiend. Let us hunt the deer together.'" "I have only my sword, Pashiplay, and cannot shoot.'" The chief's eye twinlded, as he was reminded of what he had before joyfully noticed; but. he lquietly observed: "' Pashiphay will shoot. Come, with me this -way," pointing in the direction whlere his men lay concealed. " ][ will soon lay a buclk at the feet of my friend.'" "Let Pashiphay kill his deer, and come to the fort.

Come, Captain Smith, and see great'shoot.9' "I know that Pashiphay is a great hunter and has a sharp eye," said Smith; " but my men wait for me at the fort." And he began to resume his wallk. /    <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6802-00000087"/> 164   THE YOUTH OF THE OL:D DOAMNION. "The great chief of the whites is too proud to hunt with the red man ; altliough he tried hard to save the white chief's life when he -was Opechanicanough's captive." "Pashiphay did so, and I am :not ungrateful. But would you have me neglect my great business? No. When I have time for sport, I will see you shoot. But now I zmust go. When you have killed, come to the fort, and you shall have good cheer.'" "Hist!" whispered the Indian: 1; I hear the tread; they come this way. Now you can, see;, and Pashi- phay will be proud." Smith heard nothing; and he saw nothing but a peculiar glint in the Indian's eye. Abandoning all hope of drawing Smith in the direction of his ambuDshl the chief rested his alrrow upon his bow-string, looked earnestly into the wood, and retreafed a step or two, watching as for the appearance of game. Smlith stepped in the samne direction. Pashiphay no sooner perceived this, than he knew its reason; and, leaping backward, was drawillg his bonr upon Smith, w lho, quick as his foe, with one bound grappled him. Tle whole movement had been so rapid, that Simith had had no time to find his sword-hilt. It, was now a desperatel hand-to-hand contest for life: the Indian of large stature and brawny, the Englishman compara- tively small, bat lithe and agile. T'ley had griped each other by the arms; and thus they stood for a brief time, each weaponless and motionless, but reading, in the other's eyes the stern purpose of death. A contest of main strength with such a foe left no reasonable hope for the white man. The Indian's first effort was to hurl him sideways upon the ground. Instead of re-   SINGLE COIMBATS.       165 sisting the impulse, Smith followed it; and thus, by a single leap, retained his footing. An attempt to crush him was in like manner evaded; but the movement brought both to the ground. Neither of them had loosed his gripe; for neither would risk re- ceivig,: for the hope of giving, a blow. Struggling and panting, they rolled convulsively one over the other, the perpetual activity of Smith baffling every attempt of th-le huge savage to plant h'is linee upLon his breast. Their violent and rapid contortions soon pro- duced exhaustion, and they lay thller without; motion for a few moments, the hot breath steaming in each other's faces, while they glared upont each other with unabated rage and defiance. Thle respite -was brief. They were again upon their knees., upon thei,'- feet; and the Indian now drew Smith by degrees toward the river. In this his weight and muscular power gave him the advantage. They wrere soon. upon the edlge of the bank, a sligllt but abrupt descent;, -with about waist-depth of water. Finding that lie must o, and resolving to go on equal termns, Smith. locked his leg with that of the savage, and Doth rolled rather than fell into the stream. Long they struggled in the water, until at length Smith's iron gripe was upon the Indian's throat. He could not force him under, but he blad him at decided advantage, and improved it by feeling for his swTord. After several unsuccessful ef- forts, he drew it friom its sheath. Paship'hay now would have cried for mercy; bnt he was gasping for mere breath, and his tongue hung po werless from his mouth.  He relaxed every muscle., laid his hanids quietly upon the arm which held him, turned his eyes, already starting in their sockets, to ESmith's, and said    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6802-00000088"/> 166   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. as plainly as looks and attitude could say, "Spare me! Iyield!" The point of the sword was at his breast, but it dropped. The hand was loosened from his throat. The strife was over. During the whole, not a word had been spoken. Not a word was spoken now. The powerful' captive meekly obeyed the im- perious signal of the victor, and walked before him to the shore, to his bow and arrow, which were appro- priated as trophies, and thence to the fort, where he was chained and imprisoned. He soon escaped, how- ever, with his irons upon him. These attempts upon the life of Captain Smith not only illustrate his boldness, his soldierly tact, and his presence of mind, but they show the shrewdness of Powhattan in detecting the real weakness of the colo- nists, and in discerning in whom alone their grat strength lay. They also show how completely and universally the forest monarch made his own :decrees the law of his subjects; for so implicit was their obe- dience, that they. assailed the man whom most of all they feared for his courage and skill, and whom they regarded with even superstitious awe. Although so often baffled, they continued their subtle hostilities, until the word went forth from Powhattan's mouth to cease. Two occurrences in particular contributed to this change of policy in the savage autocrat. Very soon after Smith's adventure with Pashiphay, one of Pow- hattan's villagers had obtained - dishonestly, of course - a bag of gunpowder and a piece of a suit of armor. Upon his return to Werowocomoco, wishing to dis- play to his fellows the wisdom which he had acquired, he proceeded to dry the powder upon the armor-piece   PEACE.         167 over a fire, as he had seen the, soldiers, do at James- town. Several Indians clustered around him. to wit- ness the mysterious process. The powder took fire, and blew the poor fellow, and two others, to atoms, besides terribly scorching several of the by-standers, and frightening the rest immeasurably. The appall- ing effect of this catastrophe upon the minds of Pow- hattan and his subjects can hardly be conceived. Gunpowder, instead of being coveted, became an object of the greatest dread; while Superstition and Conscience whispered in their ears that this stealing from the whites was but a hare-brained trifling with "the God of Captain Smith." The other incident to which we refer was sonmle- what analogous. Three Indians, brothers, had been concerned in stealing a pistol. One of them escaped with the prize, but the other two were apprehended. One of the two was liberated, and told, that, if he did not find- and return the pistol within twelve hours, the other should be hung. The weather was still cold, and Captain Smith ordered charcoal to be sent to the prisoner for his comfort. In a few hours, the other returned with the ransom for his brother's life. But upon opening his apartment, he was found apparently dead, overcome by the gas of the burning coal. Cap- tain Smith, - who had come, with his cool common sense and practical experience, to the poor fellow's rescuer- being annoyed by the upbraidings and. wail- ings of the other, promised to restore his brother to life. Almost hopeless as the case, was, means of resuscitation were vigorously used, and the man recovered. Here were two cases of theft. Each was followed,    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6802-00000089"/> 168   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMINION. as the Indians believed, by death. In the first in- stance, Smith -lwas not at hand, did not interfere, and the judgment of "i his God " was irreparable. In the second, he did intcrfere, and by his superhuman power the dead was mlade alive again. What now could be plainer than the insanity of contending vTith '-Captain Smith's God" '?  ]lat more suicidal, than hostility with a man under such protection, and having him- self such power? The superstitious awe with w\hich Powhattan and his subjects had. lbefore regarded Smith' was' now revived, and became unbounded. He, and all his chiefs, and ' t1he better sort of his people," -were immediately importunate for peace. Stolen g6ods were voluntarily returned; the thieves themselves were sent to,Jamestown to receive punish.. ment ; and whe, never the colonists detected and puni- ished any, the culprits w\Aould beg thlat their chiefs, should not be told of their deeds, lest they should receive a second punishment at home. It soon be- came almost literally true, thlat "Captain Smith" was a namd of so much1 weight, that no Indian '" dared to wrong the colonists of a pin J'  He was no more troubled -with thefts, plots, or treacheries; and the English could roam as carelessly and safely through the forests as the natives. So far did the latter carry their friendliness, thalt when the colonists, under a false apprehension, thought themselves about to be, attacked by a powerful force of Spanish rovers, they "came forward with the greatest alacrity, and offered to fight side by side with the English against their enemies." It was a timely and fortunate peace. When the spring opened, the colonists discovered, to their con-   PEACE.         169 sternation, that nearly one half their corn had been devoured by iats, and that the other half, which had been stored in ca sks, had rotted. In a condition so dependelnt, a state of hostility would have been fraugtilt with. woes alike to. the Indians and t;o the Engish. L But nowa , no sooner was this condition known abroadl thanl their late enemies came to their succor. They sent to Jamestown " squirrels., turkies, deerc, and other w ilde beasts 7?; Powh-attan sent them nearly: half his stock of corn ; and the humbler In- dians bade them welcome to their wigcwams fand to a share at their homely meals. Still, much wit and labor -w\ere necessary on the part of the English to 'gather food. The many lazy and profligate ones rebelled against this necessity. They dema1nded that the tools, the weapons, the very houses of the colony should be bartered, rather than they be tasked to sus- tain their own lives. They rose in wrath, because Smiith-- upo0n whom, by the deatlh of Captain Wynne, all authority had 1now  deyolved - would not let them take by force the scanty remnnant of Powhattan's stores. ' They even conspired -to, aban- don the colony. Once more Smith taught them that he was and would be master, seizing and. signally punishing their ringleader, "one ]Dyer, a crafty fel- low, and his ancient maligcner." "If you are idle," said ]he to the rest, "I will force you; if you wrangle, I will punish you; if Iyou try to run away, I wrill hang you. At the hazard of my life have I many a time saved you, when you would have starved through your own laziness and s'hiftless- ness. But now, I protest by the God that made me, you shall not only gather food for yourselves, but for 15    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6802-00000090"/> 170    THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMINION. the sick also.   Else you shall be banished from     the fort until you either mend your manners or starve." It was no idle threat, this threat of banishment; for the  Indians, with. all their generous hospitality, would not now bestow    a kernel to save from   starva- tion any one who carme to their huts without the ap- proval of Captain   Smith, and the lazy fellows knew it. They called the President cruel and tyrannical, - for which he cared not a gi'oat; but they submitted. Thus were   Smith's  ingenuity, his   courage, his watchfulness, toil, and even martial severity, in con- stant requisition to save the colony of which he was the trustee, now' from. the mach-inations of the hos- tile savage, and now   from  the malicious .instigations of the Devil.  It was a harassing and almost hopeless task; but he did' it. In May of this year (1609),     the London Compa- ny" changed the form    of government in, the colony.' Lord Delaware was appointed Governor, or Captain- * They obtained a new charter, by which they were empowered to arrange and manage their affairs without the intervention of the king. "The Supreme Council in England was now to be chosen by the stock- holders themselves. The Governor in Virginia might rule the colonists with uncontrolled. authority, according to the tenor of instructions and laws established by the Council; or, in want of them, according to his own good [or bad] discrction,.even in cases capital and criminal, iot less than civil; and in the event of mutiny or rebellion, he might' declare martial law, being himself the judge of the necessity of the measure, and the executive officer in its administration. Thus the, lives, liberty, and fortune of tie colonists were placed at the arbitrary will of a governor who was to be appointed by a commercial corporation. As yet, not one valuable civil privilege was conceded to the emigrants." Bancroft, I. 136. They were regarded simply as a garrison stationed for the security of an estate; as servants employed for a master's profit.   ANARCHY.        171 General, for life; Sir Thomas Gates, Lieutenant-Gov- erlnor; Sir George Somers, Admiral; and Captain * Newport, Smith's avowed enemy, Vice-Admiral. In the latter part of May, nine vessels sailed from Eng- land for the colony, having on board five hundred emigrants. ,Lord Delaware remained at home :for the present. Gates, Somers, and Newport had each a commission, authorizing the first one of the three who should arrive in Virginia to supersede the adrninistra- tion then existing there. They all embarked in the same vessel, that so neither one might arrive first. This vessel- the Sea-Venture -- was parted from the rest in- a gale, on the 25th :of July, when near the coast of Virginia, and was stranded upon the Bermudas Islands. Another small vessel was utter- ly lost. The seven others, having on board about three hundred emigrants, most of them moneyless, graceless, and godless, arrived at Jamestown about the 1st of August. Here was a dilemma, -the old charter of the Com- pany annulled, and they in whom the government was vested under the new, tossed by the sea, no one knew where.  Here was a dilemma, -- three hundred new mouths to be fed, and scarce fifty pairs of hands not too genteel to work. Here was a di- lemma, - three hundred more 'dissolute, reckless, unruly men to be governed, and no acknowledged governor; three hundred more to be governed, the authority of the only man capable of governing repudiated, himself an object of prejudice and dis- like to the new-comers, and yet; no one having a right to supplant him. The result was what might have been expected,-confusion, uproar, insubordi-    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6802-00000091"/> 172   THE YOUTH OF TlE OLD DOMNION. nation, chaos, anarchy; now one caprice dominant, now another; one governor to-day, a new governor to-morrow; a party for proceeding under the new charter, .a party for proceeding under the old, a party for proceeding under nothing at all. "Happie had we beene," are Smith's words, "had they never ar- rived, and we forever abandoned; for on earth, for the number, was never more confusion or misery than their factions occasioned." Some of those newly arrived had common sense, and soon discovered that the tales of Smith's incapacity and tyranny which they had heard were libels. These joined with the old settlers, who knew his worth and virtues, and entreated him to assume the magistracy and save them from destruction. His own disgust and every selfish consideration prompted him otherwise; but he felt for the interests of the colony which he had nurtured and shielded from its birth, and yielded. The moment he did so, the whole community felt the presence of a strong hand. There was a struggle, to be sure; but the factious ringleaders were at once im- prisoned for trial, disorders quelled, and the machinery of society was once more in motion. In arranging the affairs of the new community, Smith made what appears to have been the first ter- ritorial purchase of Powhattan, -- a place called by the chief's name, just below the falls of the river, - the same where his first interview with Smith and Newport occurred. But the mission of Smith in Virginia was nearly closed. Passing down the river from his new pur- chase, a bag of gunpowder exploded by his side while he was asleep. He was terribly mangled; and, in *    . '  ' '   '   ..  " t   ANARCHY.        173 the agony abnd distraction of the moment, leaped into the river, from which he was rescued in a drowning state. The voyage of one hundred miles in an open boat to Jamestown was accomplished under excru- ciating suffering. Yet when he arrived there, unable to stand, and neere bereft of his senses by reason of his torment," he was obliged to- exercise the mental energy of a hale man, to meet the domestic exigencies of the colony. Radcliffe -the whilom President., ' the poore coun- terfeited imposture" whom Smith had sent home that his throat might not be cut - was among the new- comers, and the chief of all mutineers and conspira- tors. He was one of those whom Smith had recently imprisoned to await their trial. This miscreant and his accomplices 'yielded to the temptation, which his helpless condition suggested, to take the life of Smith by assassinating him in his bed. The villain selected for the murder failed. At the critical moment, he had not the courage to fire his pistol at that man. Baffled in this scheme, the conspirators aimed at usurping the government. But the sick man was yet too strong for imbecile knaves.. His old soldiers, the stanch followers of his past fortunes, the com- rades of his wilderness toils, were exasperated by these infamous attempts. They now gathered around his bed, and besought him for orders to bring the heads of the mutineers. ( No, my friends," was his answer, "' I amr a crip- pled man. I may fairly retire from this sickening strife. If I crush insubordination, I shall be blamed at home if I fail to, I shall be blamed, So it has been for two years; So it will continue to be.

His wounds grew more dangerous. English sur- gery was necessary to save his life. So he placed the government of the colony in the hands of Lieu- tenant Percy, and sailed for England about. the 29th of September, 1609, being then only thirty years of age. ' lHe left behind him four hundred and ninety colonists, one hundred of whom were trained and expert soldiers, three ships, seven boats, twenty-four pieces of ordnance, three hundred muskets and other arms, abundance of ammunition and tools, wearing- apparel sufficient for all their wants, and an ample stock of domestic animals and provisions." If history is worth anything, it is valuable as an exponent of Divine Providence, -- as illustrating how He who plans and evolves those signal events which most attract the statesman and the Christian, 'not only endows, but eduicates, the men by whose agency He brings them to pass. In comparing their prepara- tory training with the peculiar spheres in which they have afterwards been called to act, we cannot fail to admire the plastic skill with which He adapts the former to the latter. With 'an eye to this truth, we have enlarged upon the providential apprenticeship of John Smith, though not necessary to narrating the settlement of Virginia. In his case, and in' that of Christopher Columbus, pre-eminently, by going back in their memoirs, we see how, and how thoroughly, the men were educated 'for their respective parts in the drama of the Western World.   ANARCHY.            175 We recognize the same overruling Wisdom, as we record that Smith   appeared no more as an actor on the scene of our narrative; for the young Father of Virginia was withdrawn by no human calculations or agency, but, to use a significant popular phrase,' by the providence of God."'    Though we presume not to divine its reasons, yet his withdrawal just before the imposition of a new   and questionable system    of gov- ernment suggests that his presence may       not have been  needed under the new order of things, or that his high and soldierly spirit might have proved a dis- cordant element under an administration so peculiar. He was withdrawn just before the incoming of a new magistracy; but, let it be observed, just long enough before to demonstrate for ever his controlling capaci- ties and his conservative worth." $ In 1614, Smith explored the coast of North Virginia, as it was then called, to which he gave the name, ever since retained, of New England. On this voyage, he constructed a map of the whole country, from the Penobscot to Cape Cod. After his return, a year and a half were con- sumed in a series of misadventures at sea. He passed the rest of his life in England, occupied wholly in American affairs. These, he said, "were his children, his wife, his hawks, his hounds, his cards, his dice, and in j   totall; his' best content." The mercantile bodies, whose pulses were purses, whose souls were account-books, were shy of his service; partly because they could only appreciate profit and loss, partly because they were jealous of one who aspired to things greater. His inestimable ser- vices in Virginia and on the coast of New England were unrequited, although they had consumed all his pecuniary means. and the flower of his life. "In neither of these two countries," said he, " have I one foot of land, nor the very house I builded, nor the ground I digged with my own hands, nor any content or satisfaction [i. e. emolument] at all." After his return from New England, he wrote, published, and dis- tributed no less than seven different volumes, all of them but two relat- ing to America. He died in Lofdon in 1631, in the fifty-second year of his age, occupied to the very last in writing, for publication, the results    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6802-00000093"/> 176    THE  YOUTH  OF THE   OLD DOMNION. of his own world-wide experience. Of the particulars of his death there is no record. His public character needs no analysis or eulogy. The simple narra- tive of his life is sufficient. In regard to his private morals, it is enough to quote two lines, eulogistic to be sure, but significant. The author shall indicate himself. "I never knew a warrior yet, but thee, From wine, tobacco, debts, dice, oaths, so free." "Your true friend, sometimes your souldier, THo. CARLTON."' *                       . .,   CHAPTER    XII. THE LAST CAROUSE.- STARVATION.-- REESCUE. TrIE months passed along, bearing their sev- 1610. eral records to be sealed up unto the day of revelation. From September to April, one after an- other, they had grown old, and dropped into the abyss of the Past, each burdened with its, tale of human behavior and Heavenly mercy. April, as she lingered on her last day of grace, turned her parting look over the Virginian landscape, smiled upon the fresh verdure of the forest, but dropped plenteous tears upon the set- tlement of Jamestown. The foliage was yet dripping with her affusions, the declining sun was limning the gorgeous memorial of God's covenant on the falling spray, and wood-birds were striving one with another to render their glad tribute of melody to Himn whose bow was there on the cloud. Why did the expiring month smile? Because all around God's works were glorious. Why did she weep? Because all around man's were grievous. The fortress was still there, unimpaired and bris- tling with ordnance. The dwellings were still there, rude indeed, but sufficient for the comfort of many a household. The little church was still there, with its modest spire, an index to " things above." lThe graves of the dead -of Gosnold, and Stevens, and Scrivener, and Waldo- were there, covered with green turf    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6802-00000094"/> 178   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. and flowers; while near them were many, many other mounds, on which no turf yet grew and no flowers bloomed. Where were the living, and what? There were two soldiers on the ramparts. There was a sentinel in the gateway. There were four men coming up from. the block-house on "the neck." There were a dozen sitting in the doors of the dwell- ings. Yet none were in motion but the four; and not the sound of a voice was to be heard, except from within the embrasure of the fort. In one retired apartment there were half a dozen men, whose sounds of revelry broke strangely upon the ears of the lone sentry, and accorded little with the portentous aspect of the settlement without. These men were in mili- tary costume, and wore badges of office. It was evi- dent that they had been eating at the table at which they were seated, although not a fragment was now to be seen. The bottle, however, was in circulation; and the inflamed though haggard faces of the party showed that it 1ixd been. They were evidently the victims both of hunger and of inebriety. As the last chorus of a wild and profane song ceased, one of them rose to his feet with some difficulty, and addressed the others with a ludicrous attempt at oratory. "Fellow-soldiers, and fellow-sinners! Thus far we have kept Death at bay. Some of our men have been fools enough to be murdered by the savages. Some of them have been fools enough to starve. But we have had good sense enough to keep at home, and be merry. Many a jolly time have we had here; for though our larder has been low, and hunger has pinched us, yet good-fellowship and merriment-- thanks to the bottle--have abounded in our mess, ',   THE LAST CAROUSE.      179 Let the memory of them be blessed! I have the honor now to announce, that our roistering hours are over. Our last handful of meal, our last cruse of oil, are gone. Our last bottle is before us. Upon this affecting occasion 'I give you a sentiment which I heartily commend to your adoption. I am indebted for it to one Horatius Flaccus, an old Roman whose odes were whipped into me at Eton. But as his own sweet words have gone from me, let me give you their meaning in our mother tongue: ' Fill the goblet fair! Every drop we sprinkle O'er the brow of care, Smooths away a wrinile.'" A wild hurrah rang through the room, and reached the ears of miserable wretches beyond its walls, as he concluded. When it had subsided, a young man of the company exclaimed: "-Good, good, lMr'. Thorn- hill! Let me echo to your sentiment in the vernacu- lar of the old Epicureans, who always had their hearts in their right places: ' Dumn vivimus, vivamus!' which being freely interpreted means, 'While we live, let us drink!' or, which is the same thing, 'While we drink, we live! ' Another shout of applause followed these words of the dying youth, as he suited the action to the word, and drank madly from the bottle which he held in his hand. "Pass it along! pass it along, Wilton!" exclaimed the others; and with a trembling handhe obeyed. We said, "the dying youth." Let us explain. Wilton was one of those "dissipated young men exiled by their friends to escape a worse destiny at    <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6802-00000095"/> 180   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. home."' He was of good famnily and education, as were his fellow-officers around him. But his relatives -too indolent, or too pleasure-loving, or too busy to take pains for 'his salvation--]had thrust him away, by frowns, byJ n1eglect, by harshness, from all redeem- ing influences. He gave lilMself up, of course, and was' beyond redemption.  A noble-minded,  noble- hearted young man, -willing to fight hard for deliver- ance, if he could only have one, arm to lean upon in his hours of weakness and temptation; who wept, and even prayed, in secret places, over his vice; who wept over and cursec his friiendlessness; who writhed, not only under the goadings of conscience, but even more- under the scorn and 7wrong of kindred ; so soon as he believed himself' an, outcast--was lost. 'No matter! "fiiends " were relievedl. He still retained, in his personal appearance, indi- cations of what; he had been. He was of a slender and graceful form; the outline of his features was noble; and, though his intellectual energies were shattered, they -were stl;ill discernible, as well as his amiability, in his hours of sobriety. Just now, how- ever, the mlan was hidden in the sot. There was nothing stolid or stupefied in the expression of his eye under the influence of this debauch. It blazed. As he drank again, and still again, it rapidly grew rest- less, wild, anxious, alarmed. The stimulus which he plied. seemed to have no power to nerve his system, which grew more and more tremulous -with every draught. The bottle, the dast' bottle, came to him- again. He filledl his cup, and was in the act of rais- ing it to his lips, when he suddenly looked upon a boon companion. opposite, and, spilling half its con- tents, set the cup upon Ithe table.   THE LAST CAROUSE.      181 "What 's the matter, Wiltonl?" exclaimed the other. "By Jupiter! by Bacchlmus! What s the matter with you, Newell? ' 6 Pass the bottle! pass the bottle!" cried Thorn- hill. Wilton paid no attention to the demand, but con- tinued to gaze upon Newell. T'he gaze became a glare. "By all the immortal gods, goddesses, satyrs, fauns, and demons, Newell, what are you!about? ' , ,Asking you a question. What are you star- ing at?" The attention of the'whole company Mwas now riv- eted upon the young man; and some of them began to be alarmed as they saw the unnatural expression of his features. ' I say, Newell!" - and he fairly roared. as he said it, - " what are you spirting that fire at nme for? If it does hit my :face, by -, I 'll be the death of you!" "Wilton! Hilton!"' said a companion, taking hold of his arm. "Let me alone, Branton! ' and he threw off the grasp with a spasmodic jerk, while he still. kept an apprehensive look upon Newell. Suddenly he cringed his head, as though struck by some missile; and, starting the next instant from his seat, hurled the bottle, which he still held in his grasp, with all his force at Newell. The half-intoxicated man made a feeble and awkward effort to avoid it, but it struck him full in the face, and he fell, stunned and bleeding, on the floor. All was now uproar and confusion. Thornhill and Shirley staggered to the assistance of Newell, while 16 v  ' ' *      *       s    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6802-00000096"/> 182   TH YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Branton and Lawton, the sixth of the party, made ineffectual efforts to secure Wilton. "Keep off! keep offt you devils!" cried the frantic man, retreating, and beating the air with his arms. His pursuers, a little sobered by their fright, approached him timidly; but he ran and dodged about the room With an agility which mocked their efforts. At last he placed his back against a corner of the apartment, and paused.  The inuscles of his face, his open mouth, the heaving of his chest, and his peculiar res- piration, denoted fright rather than fatigue. Branton and Lawton stood aloof. Fixing his eye upon the latter, the terror-stricken man gasped out: "Captain Radcliffe! Captain Radcliffe! Radcliffe, it was well known by the wretched rem- nant of the colony, had been brained, with thirty of his men, by the order and in the presence of Powhat- tan, some three months before. "Ugh!" continued Wilton, with a shudder; "how- your brains do dribble! I beg- I beg -Captain Radcliffe! Don't, don't spatter them in my' face! For Heaven's sake, don't!" And he wound his arms around his head as if to shield it. He then bounded from his place for an open window, and leaped through it upon the ground. The fall was but little, but Wile ton lay there as if paralyzed. Lawton and Branton, with the help of three or four feeble, emaciated, but. sober men, now succeeded in securing the maniac, and conveying him, in a state of utter exhaustion from terror, to a private apartment. The last sun of April was just dipping behind the wooded hills, and he looked through the casement as the outcast inebriate was laid senseless .on his pallet.   STARVATION.       183 There, through the livelong night, sobbed and moaned the gifted castaway; his heart throbbing faster and feebler, until it fluttered, stopped, fluttered a little while again, then ceased to beat for ever. His "friends" were relieved! Such was the last carouse of the officers in the fort at Jamestown, the last of their very many since the 29th of September. What were the pastimes of others?  The sentinel at the gateway and the t\wo soldiers on the ramparts had not been there in the performance of military duty. Such a thing was hardly thought of now, though never more necessary. They were there to quiet their own impatience, eagerly watching for the return of comrades who had gone out into the forest. They were very much emaciated, with hollow cheeks, and sunken eyes, and skinny hands, leaning against the walls for support; and shuffling along whenever they -walked, as if it were a grief to move,- and so it was. As soon as those before mentioned as coming up from the block-house on "the neck" were seen, the two on the ramparts exerted themselves, and joined the sentinel, as we have called him, at the gate. Before long, the scouts came up, nmeagre, gaunt, disheartened-looking men like the others,--creeping painfully along, and sat down wearied in the gateway. These seven were the strong men of the commoners, the bullies whom none dared to interfere with, for they were the only ones except the drunken officers who had weapons.  They had, formed a sort of league, and constituted a clan b! themselves. The "sentinel," Hicks, was head-man, and one of the new- comers, Spicer, second-man. Without one of these,    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6802-00000097"/> 184   THE YOUTH OF THE, OLD DOMNION. none of the party ever left the fort. As Spicer and his fellows seated themselves, the others looked wist- fully at them in silence. After waiting a moment, Hicks spoke angrily: "What do you wait for, Spicer? Undo your bud- get; -quick, man!" Can't you let me get my breath?" ' No!" Spicer drew a small bag from the skirt of his coat, and threw it upon the ground. "There's your stuff; we 'e had enough of it." The few nuts and roots were quickly divided be- tween the three who had remained in the fort, and were quickly devoured. The shouts of the officers at their revels now sound- ed upon their:ears, and the wretched men's faces, as they looked one at another, were eloquent of indigna- tion. They remained silent and sullen, however, until the second shout, occasioned by the response of the miserable Wilton td the words of Thornhill. Hicks could restrain his wrath no longer. ' Curse the rascals!" he exclaimed, grinding his teeth and clenching his bony fists. "They 'd get drunk at their mothers' funerals, and dance on their mothers' graves, rather than not get drunk at all!" "Rayther a change, Captain, from the old order of things!" said one of the men with a sarcastic drawl. "Wiggins, Strickland, Jones, Lane, Spicer-- every one of yon,--we are not given to praying," said Hicks, with a wild look of fury; " but I am going to pray now, and do you pray with me, for these fel- lows who hold back bread from the starving, who riot and make merry and get drunk among the dying and the dead!"   STARVATION.        185 He uncovered his head; the others uncovered also. It was an impressive scene, that grizzly soldier of nearly threescore years, his hair worn scant and thin by the pressure of his casque, turning up his sunken eyeballs and stretching out his arms imploringly to heaven. Every line of his haggard face was alive, and he uttered as earnest a prayer as ever came from treim- bling lips; but it was an awful, a vehement pleading for the' hot and speedy wrath of the Almighty upon the men who made sport'in the midst of overwhelm- ing miseries! His comrades shuddered as he pro- nounced his husky, but vigorous. ( Amen!" and Hicks himself shuddered too, buried his face, in his hands, bent his head upon his knees, and went into a convul- sive fit of weeping. His companions, at first awed by the terribleness and energy of his imprecations, were now frightened by a passion which rapidly became agony. But; when he tore his own hair, and bit his own flesh, and glared about like a maniac, two of them sprang upon him, first to secure, and then to soothe, while the others stood aloof through fear. Hicks soon yielded to a few kind words anld services, aiid his anguish subsided into' intermittent fits of sob- bing, when Spicer and Lane judiciously conveyed the sufferer to his dwelling. The rest remained, until the plunge of poor Wilton. from the window demanded their service. "May God forgive me!" said the wretched Hicks, as he lay on his bed about midnight, surrounded by his comrades. "I was frenzied with famine ; but but they were horrible words!" He wept againj but they were quiet and relieving tears, which wet his pillow.

When he awoke, he found his friends still watching by his side, and, raising himself to a sit- ting posture, f Look there!" said he, ' and there " pointing with his finger to different parts of the room. "You see what we are coming to. Shall we come to it, or shall we not? that's the question." The men looked, and though, through familiarity with such scenes and their own sufferings, they were past pity, they shuddered as they saw what them- selves might be. The objects which Hicks indicated were an attenuated corpse, with its chin dropped and its glassy eyes open, near the centre of the room, and a dying man who sat against the wall, holding the fragment of a cast-off shoe, and mumbling it between his teeth. "' Now," continued Hicks, in a sepulchral whisper, "we must come to it, or do something which is hor- rible. No!" and he shook his head, as he caught a look from the others which needed no interpretation. "No! not thenm! But--- but--" He stopped, as if he could not say what he must. "It 's no use mincing matters," he resumed. "We must,--we must. Come," said he, with a ghastly effort to smile, and rising to his feet. ' Take a spade, Wiggins, and a tinder-box." And so they went, in the still watches of the night, far awray from the' frenzied shrieks and feeble moan- ings of the starving, into the placid and moonlit forest, to the shallow grave of an Indian whom Hicks had   STARVATION.       187 shot and covered a few days before; and they kin- dled a fire, and they uncovered the dead, and * * * And then they slept there in the quiet wood, gorged to satiety, until the birds woke them with their morn- ing songs to God. And again those men went there, and yet again, and they throve and. grew strong; but when the birds sang in the mornings, they di not sing with them'. During the first night-excursion of Hicks and his comrades, there was a man sitting on a stone by his doorway. He could not sleep for the agony of that gnawing- gnawing-- gnawing sensation of madden- ing hunger. But just within the open door his wife was slumbering; for, with her, tihe ravening, acute suffering of 'starvation had passed, and she wras just merging into that comparative stupor which next supervenes. Her slumbers, however, were light and uneasy. The man, --who was he? John Laydon, who had married with Anne Burras? Our authori- ties do not say. The man sat there alone, chewing an old glove, while the moon smiled upon him, and the whippoorwill sang to him, just as though they could make him happy. Well, instead of that, they made him mad,--mad,--for he was starving, and fancied that they were mocking him. There was an axe at the door-sill. He saw it shine in the moon- light, and, he smiled. He did; he smiled,--that starving wretch! And then he slowly and feebly got up; and he looked at the axe again, and then he took it. '  Johnohn!John!" cried the wife; for though he had crept in like a cat, she had heard his heavy, agi- tated breathing, and seen him raise the axe. She    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6802-00000099"/> 188   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. sprang to her feet; but the hot blood spirted from her shoulder, for the light was imperfect, and the blow had been unsteady, "O John! do not! do not!" and she fell upon her knees, and flung her lean arms, as strongly as she could, around his waist.  Though he struggled to push her off, she managed to say: "We have loved we have prayed together; and now let us die as God pleases, only together, John, - together Don't strike again; but kiss me,--kiss me once more, and then we will go, and--" They were her Jlast words. For two, three, four days, the man grew stronger. But he was gloomy, and kept out of sight; and when by chance he met some one, he was so shy, and had such a hang-dog look, as to attract attention. To the question, "Where is your wife, John?" put to him occasionally by a neighbor, he had not courage even to say, " She has died as the others have died." He was dumb, and slunk away.   uspicion, or at least curiosity, was roused.  Good God, sir!" said Branton to Thornhill, " half the man's wife was  was -  in brine, sir!

Who was it that rifled the corpses of his own com- rades from  the places where they had been laid to rest until the consummation of all things?     Who was it that dug there, like the hyena, to satisfy the gnaw- ings of his hunger?   Who was it that did this again and again, until he had created within himself a new appetite, as imperious and insatiable as it was- demo- niacal,   whose sacrilegious craving no remonstrance of the living, no expressions of detestation, no threats of punishment, could restrain, --who was so frenzied by his horrid indulgence, that nothing but a felon's death  could end it?   Some one, but we know      not who; for though IIistory has recorded his enormity, she has refused to write his name.     He was not the only one who did this thing, but; the only one incor- rigible. After such statements, it is but a small thing      to of Gates's statement is, that the murder was instigated only by hatred, and that the frenzy of starvation was feigned as a palliation of the mur- der. Bnt Gates was not present at Jamestown at the time, and must 'have founded his version on hearsay. In opposition to this, we have the best possible testimony, - the sol- emn declaration of "eyewitnesses and sufferers in those times," - mem- bers of the legislature of Virginia in 1624.. In their address ill answer to the praises given to the administration 'under Sir'Thomas Smith as Treasurer of the Company, dated February, 1624,- an address signed by Sir Francis Wyatt, the Governor his Council, and twenty-four Burgesses, nearly or quite the full number of the House, -they state the fact recorded in our text positively and clearly. This address is in Stith, 304- 307. Camnpbell (p. 30) adopts Gates's explanation; yet, in a note, quotes as authority on another point this very address of the eyewitnesses.

' those who had fled to the savages for relief, by hanging, shooting, break- ing upon the wheel, and the like ; or that a starving man, "for stealing two or three pints of oatmeal, had a bodkin thrust through his tongue, and was chained to a tree till he perished." There was some temp- tation in such exigencies to diminish the number of. mouths. Such were the terrible scenes at Jamestown in the spring of 1610. One after another, the wretched men and women and children pined, and grew frantic whith hunger and despair.  One after another they died, and the emaciated survivors dragged them to burial. It should be stated, however, that Mr. Percy, to' whom  Captain Smith had committed the govern-  ment, was in no way responsible for the miseries of the colonists or the excesses of the officers. For a long time he had labored under violent disease, and, when Smith. was compelled to leave, had already taken his passage to England.  The necessities and importunities of the-colonists prevailed upon him to remain. But during the whole of this dreadful time he was unable to rise from his bed. But where were the ships, and where the abun- dant stores, and where the stock of swine and fowls, * The address of the Assembly describes events covering a space of twelve years, and does not aasign dates to the scveral facts Which it specifics.

And where were the Indians, with their large supplies and their ready hospitality;--the Indians, who had sued for peace, who had anxiously ratified and cemented it by eager liberality? Ay! ask rather, Where was John Smith? Where was his authority, - his foresight, --his provi- dence,-his magic influence over the red man? Two of the three vessels had left for England, " laden with nothing but bad reports and letters of discourage- ment." From the moment of Smith's departure, dis- order had run riot; revolutions had followed one after another; the strongest had ruled, -- one set with their President yesterday, another set with their President to-day. The granaries had .been wastefully exhausted. The people had abandoned themselves to such laziness, "that they would eat fish raw, rather than go a stone's cast to fetch wood and dresse it." For the same reason, they had neg- lectec to secure and salt down, in the season,. the sturgeon with which the river abounded, and had even suffered their nets to be spoiled beyond repair. The Indians, discovering the absence of the master- spirit whom they had revered and almost idolized, had renewed hostilities, and murdered from ambush every straggler from the fort. They had stolen and destroyed the live stock of the colonists; they had spoiled their boats; they had, driven all the deer into distant forests; they had withholden their corn, or only exchanged it, at high rates, for firelocks and swords. These had been insanely bartered away for food by the colonists, who thus gradually gave up both their means of defence and of hunting.

Pow- hattan gloried. in scalps. Before these hostilities had become flagrant, the third vessel 'which had been left by Smith- the Swallow --- had been sent out to procure corn from the Indians; but her cre-w, about thiirty in number, after procuring' a large quantity, resolved upon piracy, and took to the high seas. Radcliffe, with thirty men, had then made an at- tempt at trade with Powhattan, upon the strength of the chief's invitation. "Under the color of the fairest friendship," the crafty savage had managed to entice them one by one into different houses, and thus easily murdered all, save one who escaped, and a boy, Henry Spilman, whom Pocahontas contrived to save. By these several means, it had come to pass by midwinter that the remnant of the colonists were re- duced tio utter destitution, and the slow, wolvish work of famine commenced.  Hence the miseries and horrors which we have noted. Starving, lamenting - even his worst enemies and maligners lamenting--the absence of Captain Smith, growing gaunt, and weak, and unpitying, and brutal, - some idiotic, some raving mad, shrinking to living skeletons before lying down to die,- thus the col- ony mourned and suffered, dwindled and lingered. Three dreadful weeks in May the survivors struggled on, skulking about in the woods, dodging the In- dians, picking berries, and digging roots, until they had no more hope. An hour or two after sunrise on the 24th of May, a   RESCUE.        193 faint, booming sound was heard by the despairing. remnant, like the sound of a distant cannon. The men raised their drooping heads for a moment, and looked at one another; but not a whispered word broke the sullen gloom of Jamestown. An hour afterwards came another sound like the first, but more like a real one. A few men now staggered to their feet and listened. They began to draw togeth- er - those who could; for in their starving jealousy, and even hate, each one had kept by himself. Fel- lowship had become obsolete. They now spoke one to another, in whispered monosyllables at first, they had become so unused to ,peech. "Harkl!" "A gun?"  D' ye hear?" '"A tree fell." Such was the crusty conversation which the few attempted. But again and again that sound! It was a gun! Some vessel must be coming up the river! When, at length, a signal was given from Hog Island, by a few of-their number who had managed to ferry thither, that two vessels were in sight, the settlement presented a most affecting scene. The poor wretches knew not, and cared not, whether they bore Spanish foes or English friends. There must be life on board, - humanity, - food, - plenty, - deliverance, - Paradise! Enough! enough! The transition was so great and so sudden from fiendish despair to hope, to assurance, to feverish impatience, that some sank into insensibility, some leaped about wild with excite- ment, - here one uttering a tolerable English shout, there another making a most unearthly failure. All who could crept to the shore; but there were many who could only reach their thresholds; some, help- less and neglected in their dwellings, who could only 17     ' ,       )    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6802-00000102"/> 194   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. 'wonder at those strange noises without, so like holi day sounds in good old England; some, who lay still and stark upon their floors, or on the open ground, and who could not hear. Upon the shore, some were looking eagerly for the coming sail; some stood still and wept, and wept hysterically; and a few calmly kneeled downr there and gave solemn thanlks to God. What a meeting!  The commissioners, Gates, Somers, and Newport, who had constructed -two small vessels from their wreck on the Bermudas, came on shore, expecting to find a homne with a strong and prosperous colony. Thle handful who stood there, so attenuated, so shadowy, so forlorn, seemed like wandering ghosts on the banks of the Styx. The resuscitation of the settlement was de- bated, but abandoned; for the vessels were deficient in the necessary supplies, and the miserable residents had no heart for anything but to escape from a place where they had witnessed and suffered such unspeak- able horrors. -It was therefore promptly decided to gather up the fragments of humanity which remained, and to set their faces homeward. But there were preliminary tasks. There were un- buried dead to be put out of sight. There were men whose pulses scarcely beat to be revived and only by the most delicate treatment; and even those who had most of life were to be restrained from fatal indul- gence, and rendered fit by slow degrees for the ordi- nary fatigues of the sea. These melancholy but in- dispensable duties occupied fourteen days. On the 8th day of June, the fort and hamlet, the church and churchyard of Jamestown, were the only relics there of heroic efforts and of graceless follies.   RESCUE.        195 Of the five hundred persons whom Smi th had left there with all the furniture for prosperity, thirty had turned pirates on the sea, and the rest had 'been cut off bIy the Indians and by famine, except sixty who embarked with the comnliS 'oners, and who, had relief been deferred but three jays longer, iwould also have been among the dead.  The unplanted corn-field, thedismnantled fort, the si- lent church, the deserted cabins, the uncounted graves, - wlat a governor Lord Delaware would be! The moment when man's impotence is demon- strated is the choice and chosen moment for God's intervention. It is the moment for disclosing his careful oversight,--so little noted, yet ever and every- where maintained. It is the moment when his provi- dence is intuitively acknowledged; when his hand is clearly recognized; when his deliverance is welcomed and appreciated, and devoutly praised. Such was the exigency which we are recording. Elated even to intoxication, though forthe moment only, by a salvation so critically wrought, the settlers dropped down the river with the tide, sorely depressed and murmuring that all the toils and sufferings of the past had been for naught. It was night when they glided with heavy and sullen hearts upon, the bosom of the tranquil river. It was mnorning, when they emerged from the Hampton Roads and entered the broad harbor below. "A vision of white sails cheered their hearts! As the sun came up on the 9th of June, the long-boat of Lord Delaware was seen ap- proaching."1 Fresh immigrants and supplies at their hands, the fugitives returned to the peninsula; and    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6802-00000103"/> 196   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. never perhaps was praise chanted more heartily, more tearfully, than before the altar in Jamestown on the morning of the 10th of June. "Weeping may endure for a nialtt, but joy cometh in the mnorninr.' "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!" Under such circumstances, who could refrain from emotion at the recitation of such words? Thus Lord Delaware was not governor of a deso- lated settlement.  Unembarrassed by partners in his administration, exercising a mild but decided authority, the influence of his personal rank enhanced by his dignity of man- ner and his well-known virtues, he infused new life into the colony, and established moderate, but syste- matic labor. Good fellowship, cheerfulness, and even a. religious sentiment, were discreetly cultivated, and began to pervade the settlement. Prosperity looked in at the gate, dispensed her gifts in moderation, and her inspiring influences in profusion. Severe sickness compelled Lord Delaware's return to England on the 28th of March, 1611. Percy acted in his stead, until the arrival of Sir Thomas Dale in May of the same year, who assumed the government, and, in the true spirit of an old soldier, as he was, established martial law, as directed by the Company. In August, Sir Thomas. Gates arrived, with six ships, three hundred immigrants, and' one hundred kine; the last a wise ,and invaluable consignment. The government of the colony - now amounting to seven hundred men - devolved upon him. **              RESCUE.        197 Hitherto no labor of any colonist had accrued to his exclusive personal advantage. Each man's ca- pacity to labor belonged to the community, and the products of his toil, whatever they might be., had been public property. He had not been rewarded accord- ing to his work and the smiles of Providence upon it, but according to his necessities as a unit among so many hundieds. He had had no persocnal propety in that which his labor produced. NSow, a new order of things was established. Each man had garden and  orchard set apart for his. own use. An amount of productive ildustry, and of ready obedience, which nothing but the stimulus of self-dependence and self- reward could have effected, was the result. Know- ing that each moment of toil was a seed for his own harvest, one man now accomplished more than ten had done when laboring for the common store. 17     <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6802-00000104"/> CHAPTER    XIII. MAlRYING A PEACE.   SEVENTEEN years had tried their skill upon the form and .features of Pocahontas. They had now brought her to the verge of womanhood, and each one, as a parting memorial, had given her some fresh grace or new ou;tline, until her dowry of beauty was thbe wonder and pride of the wilderness. The delicacy of her mind and the gentleness of her heart, though less discerned and less appreciated by hler people, had been equally developed. The glimmer- ilgs of Christian truth which had reached her mind had been faint and few, yet they had inparted sym- metry to her character, spiritual beauty to her fea- tures, and placid dignity to her external life. Since the white chief in whose honor and protec- tion alone she had confided had disappeared, she had never ventured from the homes and presence of her kindred. Indeed, only once in all this time had she made herself known to any of the English. When, as has been stated, Powhattan had doomed Radcliffe and his party, she had glided from her wigwam, and led one lad from the hlouse of slaughter to a place qf safety. This was all she could, do. Powhattan, in his savage humor, could not abide an angel of mercy even: in her form 'and had frowned.

He was a kind-hearted old man, and he lovedl her, partly for her own beauty and goodness, and partly because, lie himself, she was a friend to  the English. Japa- zaws ,had made a covenant of peace with Captain. Smith, when on his exploring voyage through the Chesapeake, -- to his dying day hIe kept the covenant, -and so he had given welcome and refuge to Poca- hontas. He owed no allegiance to Powhattan, but, ]ike him, was a chief of chiefs. "Why should my friend be angry?" said. Captain Samuel Argall, as Japazaws eyed him silently, with a look of mingled amazement and indignation. "The wood-pigeon flies into my lodge. It trembles like the poplar-leaf. It pants for breath. Then it coos, and coos, and says, ' Japazaws!' ' What do you want, poor thing?' I answer. Japazarws! I am very weak and timid. I can only fly. Because I pity the bleeding birds and fawns in, the nest of the eagle, he is angry. Let me hide here and rest.' Ja- pazaws says: ' Little trembler! do not fear. Rest in my shadowr as long as you will. I will spread my branches and my leaves over yort, and you shall be sheltered.' And so it perches on. the boughlls of the rough old oak. It weaves its little bed, and nestles in it. It plumes its wings, and coos, and is happy. Shall Japazaws entice it into the snare of the hunter?" "The king of the Potomacs does well to be angry, if he thinks I would harm the bird which he has prom- ised to shelter.

' Would you not put her in your cage? Would she not pine there? Would she not break her heart, and die?" "No." ' Then tell me what you mean. I am old, but not so foolish that I cannot understand the talk which is honest." "Are you not a friend of the English?" Y'es." "Do you like to have them slain by the arrows of the Powhattans?" No." ' Are you a friend of Powhattan?" "Yes."'         .  ' Do you like to have his braves killed by the guns of the English?  ' Are you a friend of Pocahontas?" Yes." "Would you not like to have her and her father happy, sitting together once more in the same lodge, and in love?"?  "Yes.". "Now listen, Japazaws! I ask' you only to make all these your friends happy; to stop the flowing of blood; to light the pipe of peace for the PoNwhattans and the English; and to bring back the loving daugh- ter to the home and the bosom of her father. Bring. her to me. Let me take her, to the English. We will say to Powhattan ' Here is your dear daughter.

So Japazaws will do much kindness, if he lead Pocahontas to the big, canoe of the white man,' This conversation took place in the cabin of Argall's vessel, then at anchor in the Potomac whither he had been sent from Jamestown to pr"ocuroe supplies of corn. Jap azaws, who had not comliprehended at .first the true object of Argall's startlingl proposition that he should deliver Pocahontas into his hlands, was now evidently impressed with its policy and plausible hu- manity. This Argall perceived; and, seizinrg the op- portune moment to deepen and fix the impression, he turned and drew frorm a locker against the transom of the vessel a bright copper ket tle:, which he quietly placed on the table. The chief',s eyes sparkled -with admiration. ' I do not as:k my friend," contihnuced Argall, 1 to do me a small favor, but a great one'; and it is fit that so kihgly a transaction, one which will bring great warriors to be at peace, should be followed by a lingly gift.

'; Japazaws!" resumed Argall, after letting the charm work a little while, " that is. a present fit for a great king. Only P'oWhattan has one like it. Japa- zaws should have one too." "It is wonderful! Japazaws will give much corn." "Pocahontas: no corn." The chief's countenance suddenly fell; but, after a moment's silence, he said gravely, ' How shall I know that my bird will be treated kindly?"' "' I promise, said Argall with solemnity. "   And how can I know that; there rill be peace, or that Pocahontas will not be unhappy with the Eng- lish?" "There will be peace. Powhattan's love for Poca- hont;as makes it sure. She will not be unhappy, for she loves the English, and we love her." But- but"- and Japazaws pushed the tempt- ing object from him-- she will think me cruel and treacherous to make her a captive. Japazaws could not bear it,:' "Pocahontas will thank you for putting her in the way of making peace. Besides, you need not make her a captive: I will. Do you only persuade her hither. I will steal her from you; ' and you can be very much amazed, and grieved, and broken-hearted, and angry. Could n't you cry, Japazaws? and could n't you threaten war?:' The chief's last and paramnount difficulty was re- moved by this suggestion: lie could throw dust in the eyes of Pocahontas.   I.

And Japazaws shall have the 'copper kettle too " And he bestowed a most idolatrous look upon the magnificent object.- The chief was paddled to the shore by his men. With a parting signal thence of assurance to Captain Argall, he turned his face towards his distant lodge, and disappeared in the forest.  The face of the country on eitler side of the .river was undulating. Many of the hills were planted, and yielded,both plenty and variety of fruits. About' "six' myles vp the woodes" from the river, and on a cleared emninence commanding a pleasant view, was the resi- dence of the chief. Here was a cultivated tract of land, of about a hundred and fifty or two hundred acres, most of the standing trees having beel, deprived of foliage and life, partly by bruising the bark with hatchets of stone, and partly by ' scortching the roots with fire that they grow no miore." The turf and diminutive growth had been broken up " with a crooked peece of wood,' and thus the ground was prepared for seed. Over this little farm - or, rather, this series of gardens --lay the dwellings of the residents, scattered here and there in clusters, separated by small and shady groves. Upon one side of this clearing, and bordering upon the for- est, lay the village proper, or fortress, an enclosure of perhaps an acre or more, consisting of palisades firmly planted in the ground, and having but one opening "The prospect of a treaty by means of :Pocahontas probably turned the balance in his niind.

Within this, and hard upon the wall, were several buildings consisting of stout upright poles drawn securely together at the top, and covered neatly, and weather-proof, with barks of trees, reeds, or mat- ting. One of these, standing by itself and distin- guished by its style and by its length of a hundred and fifty feet, was the dwelling of Japazaws. On the morning after his conference with Argall, he sat, just within the entrance, employing his royal hands and craft in making arrows. A few slender reeds lay near him upon the ground, fragments of crystallized quartz, and the sharp spurs of turkeys. With his knife, made of the splinter of a reed, he had just trimmed the feathers of an arrow, and was now securing a pointed crystal for its head. His wife was seated upon a narrow platform reared against the side of the hut, and elevated a little more than a foot from the ground. Being a, royal residence, and somewhat- magnificent in its plan, the hut was divided info no less than five compartments. From one of these Poc- ahontas had just made her appearance, lad in a short robe of deer-skin delicately dressed, dyed, fringed, and tastefully ornamented with a sort of beads made from the pearly shell of the oyster. It was held to- gether about the waist by a neatly clasped girdle of English workmanship, a memorial of Captain Smith. Across her shoulders, and hanging in front, floated a loose scarf, a gift fromr the same hand, as were also a few other ornaments which glittered upon her person. Her hair, which was long, abundant, and of'finer tex- ture than was usual with her people, was kept back from her forehead by a fanciful band of native manu- facture, and ornamented with a string of native pearls,   MARRYING A PEACE.       205 contrasting finely with the jet-black tresses with which they were interwoven. Her movement was light and animated, and her countenance cheerful, yet a careful eye would have detected there' a shade of sadness. Although with kind friends, she felt her homelessness. She longed for those paternal caresses which she once monopolized as "Powhattan's dearsest daughter." There had been no immediate conversation between the royal couple save casual remarks upon trivial mat- ters, for they had planned their operations the night before. But the moment Pocahontas made her ap- pearance, Japazaws exclaimed, with surly energy, addressing his wife: "Keep in your own lodge: you are not a man." "What am I? "A woman.' "What else?" "Nothing." "Nothing!" she retorted in a quick, sharp tone. "I am the wife of Japazaws!  "Well, 'wife,' then. And for what? To go on the war-path? To run after stranygers? To sit with great chiefs? No! To plant my corn, and cook my food, and bear my children. Be content." "Have I not done it all, all? and for years, and years, and years?" she rejoined, rising and striding about with passionate gestures. "Take warning, child!" turning to Pocahontas. "A young brave will come, with a present in his hand alnd a smile on his lip, and say: ; Pocahontas! you are lovely as the even- ing 'star; you are graceful as the fawn; you are a beam of light from the 'Great Spiril Be the light of my lodge, and the life of my life.' So you become    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6802-00000108"/> 206  THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. his wife. Then he says: ' Plant my corn; -weed my  corn; pound my corn; cook my corn; bear my chil- dren!' And when you are old, and have planted, and cooked, and borne children, ask of him a gift, or a smile, or a day of pleasure, or some other little de- light, and he will snap, and'growl, and say: 'Keep in , your lodge, old'womran; work, and plant, and dig.' He 'll flatter you to get you; he 'll get you to use  you; and when you are old, he 'll spurn - spurn- - spurn you!" The woman seemed wrought almost to frenzy; but Japazaws whittled away at his arrow-ork, and re- -plied to her torrent of words only by a contemptuous grunt.  Now the old couple had seemed to Pocahontas not only to live in peace, but in love, and she was utterly amazed at their sharp and sudden quarrel. With wonder in her eyes, she gently asked the cause of her hostess's grief.  "O, it is nothing,ld! only an old wife would  like to see the white man's big canoe, and .big guns, and other wonderful things, and the old chief is cross J about it. He says, 'No,' because, you see, an old  4 man can find no greater pleasure than to torment a  faithful, worn-out wife. It's the way of the men, Poc-  ahontas!"  The maiden smiled incredulously, although shc   t was grieved at the distress of her kind protectress. Hoping to soothe her, she said: 'The white man's  canoes are only big.

If she was old and ugly as you, she would wish to stay at home; but as she is so youong and so handsome, she wants to be seen: O. yes! she wants to go. But. she sha n't. Do you hink I would risk having my beautiful wife run away with some young English lover? Japazaws is too cunning." Satire and irony both appeared to be too much for the wonman's nerves to bear, and she began to weep. ' Ugh! there come the women's \yeapons!" ex- claimed the chief, mlimicking a groan. "We men can get along with scolding and the pouts, Poca- hontas; but when a lovely woman takes to tears, woe to the man she cries at!" Then, turning sharply to his wi:fe: "Y You had bet- ter stop, my pet! my sweet! The salt waters will spoil your beauty; then you could n't go to the canoe. Stop, I say! You won't? Well:, if you will spoil a face so charming, don't do it before my eyes. I have a very tender heart, and could n't bear to see it. So get out of my sight! D' you hear?" The woman persisted in weeping, and advanced even to sobs and moans; but she did not move. L Getting noisy!" exclaimed her lord, passionately. " Out of my sight, I say! o Ah! you won't?" spring- ing to his feet, and grasping a stout cudgel. The movement was enough. The woman disap- peared in a twi{nkling, leaving the field to Japazaws and Pocahontas. ; Hush, child, hush!" said the chief, perceiving that his guest was about to intercede. "It is only a silly whim of hers. There is no reason in it. She    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6802-00000109"/> 208  rTHE YOUTH OF rHE OLD DOMNION. shall not go; so don't say one word. She 'll forget  it herself to-morrow."                . But to-morrow came, and with it a like scene, only more violent. The third day it was enacted again,  with still more grievous embellishments. The cudgel  was threatened, but in vain. The tears flowed so largely, and the importunity was so annoying, that  the fortitude of the husband gave way.  "Wellj' said he, at last, "I should like a little peace at home. I am willing to take the trouble to go with you. It 's only the effect of your charms upon the pale-faces that I fear. Now if our good, discreet Pocahontas, who we all know has no charms  of her own to take care of, or to do mischief with, will only go to protect yours, or to help me in pro-  tecting them, perhaps I shall get you, home safe; and then we shall have an end of this brawling and blub- berinug." ' "O, I will go with all my heart!" replied Poca- hontas, completely deceived by this well-acted farce, and distressed: by such altercations. "I will do any-  thing to please you. You are so kind,- so kind to , a poor girl like me and I should be ashamed to be  ungrateful.' "But do you think, child, that it will be safe? Shall we be able to protect so much loveliness?"  pointing, with a sneer, to the tanned and furrowed face of his weeping wife. Pocahontas smiled. '" yes! I do not fear the whites. They are good to me.  They will' respect me, and any one who is my friend and companion." "Welle, we, we shall, see," said Japazaws, shuffling his way out of the hut; "but it would be a sad thing   MARRYIkG A PEACE.      209 if an old man like me should lose - should lose. such a --such a- :' And, with a loud laugh, he prepared "to lead his bird into the snare of the hunter." "Thus they betraied the poore innocent Pocahon- tas aboord." Bitterly did she weep, when told by Captain Argall that she was his prisoner, and must go with him to Jamestown.  "Whereat the old Hew and his wife began to how-le and crie as fast as Pocahontas"; though once out of her sight, "with the kettle and other toies, they went merrily on shore." Pocahontas was soon composed, and even con- tented, when she found that she .was treated with true consideration and kindness, and particularly when she. clearly understood that her capture was merely an expedient, and a rational one, for effecting a peace with her father. Upon her arrival at Jamestown, a little by-play was commenced,--such as most men and women have shared in 'sooner or later in life. It seemed an insignificant affair; but it was not. It began in a religious way, yet it had more substance and more influence than most men's ireligion. There was a young Englishman there, " an ;honest gentleman and of good behauior," whone name was John Rolfc. When he saw this fair flower of the wilderness, he was suddenly in pressed with the mournful truth that the colonists hitherto jlad been so engrossed in do- mestic brawls, a)d in the vulgar business of merely supporting exisnence' that they had neglected one professed object of their enterprise, - the conversion of the heathen. Poor Master Hunt had had more , *  . ', 18*    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6802-00000110"/> 210   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. than he could do to .kekp men converted; or, in Smith's words, " to make/ good Christians and good subjects of those that counterfeited themselves both." ^ To be sure, "Master Whitaker had chosen and im- paled a faire framed Parsonage and one hundred acres called Rockehall," farther up the river, opposite to the settlement called Henrico, which Dale had commenced the year before; and here "'the Apostle of Virginia. had assisted in bearing the name of God to the gentiles." Yet little had been effected; and, as we have said, Master Rolfe was forcibly reminded  of the lack of missionary labor, the moment he set eyes on the beautiful heathen maiden who came a captive to Jamestown. At least, so we argue from his behavior. He instantly assumed the vocation of  S a Christian teacher; not in public, to be sure, -for he was no canonical, -- but in private, and with only one pupil. Pocahontas was u quick and docile," and had before gathered some crumbs which had fallen to her from the Master's table. It was pleasant to teach so fair a specimen of Nature's handiwork, and  one so unsophisticated, so amiable, so impressible,  -very pleasant. Doubtless it was pleasant to be  taught.                .  At any rate, while he was training her innate faith  and love upward and heavenward, his own, some- how, became the trellis upon which, like young and tender vines, they clambered. Thus the affections of teacher and pupil became so entangled, the faith and  love of each toward Heaven were so wove n in with faith and love toward one another, -- in other words, these two young hearts became so effectually inter- twined, - that there was no such thing as separating s      \*    MARRYING A PEACE.      2" them. They found it dut one day,-whether on some fresh and sparkling morning, or in some placid moonlight evening, is of no importance, - but they found it out. They happened to look intol each other's eyes. Rolfe saw a little image of himself in hers, and Pocahontas saw a little image of herself in his, - and' just as plain! Here was a dilemma! What should they do now? They could not undo. O no! neither of them thought of that for a moment. The first thing they did was, with some trepidation, "to confess their faults one to another" - a duty which they chanced to discover while reading the fifth chapter of. the General Epistle of James. This -done, there was a tacit understanding between them for the present, that they would just make the best of their entanglement; that the one would. by no means reproach the other; in short, that they would peace- fully grow upward and heavenward -together. A wise conclusion! And, as they could find no Chris- tian precept for publishing their case just now, they said iot a word about it for some time, except when they were alone,- and then,. you know, they could n't help it. In the mean time, the great folks, - Sir Thomas Gates, the Governor, and Sir' Thomas Dale,--who could not descend to sush paltry things as young people's hearts, were busying themselves with mat- ters of state.' They were going to effect a treaty of peace. They were, going to bring Powhattan to terms. They had got the proud chief's pearl of great price in their hands, the darling of his gray age, the delight and pride of his eyes; and they would pull at the old man's heart-strings till they    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6802-00000111"/> 212   THE YOUT1H OF THE OLD DOMNION. cracked, or wrench from him a treaty of peace. It  should be done genteelly, though. So they sent an embassy to hin, saying " that his daughter Poca- hontas le loved so dearly" was their prisoner,a  word which rasped his heart. But, they added, they had their price for her, namely, all the English pris-  oners, and all the English arms and tools, in his  possession. If lie would restore these, they would - restore his daughter; otherwise, they would keep  her. But Powhattan was not a man to be bullied. It wrung his' soul that his pet child should be held cap- tive by men in whose tender mercies he had no con- fidence ; but he had the dignity of a king in his keeping, as well as the feelings of a father. The sturdy chief could suffer, but he could not bend to dictation. Besides, the English captives which he had were invaluable to him as mechanics.  He therefore disdained to reply long enough to show that he was not to be pricked into terms. Three months after the overture, he sent seven English  captives to Jamestown, each with an unserviceable  musket; 'also an axe, a saw, and one canoe laden  with corn. With these came a message, that, if his daughter should be restored, he 'would make satisfac-  tion for all injuries done to the colonists, send them five hundred bushels of corn, and be their friend for ever. In reply, he was told that what he had sent would be kept as part payment of the ransom de- manded; but that other arms and other prisoners which he had must be returned also before Poca- hontas should be liberated. It was added, however, that she should be kindly treated. At this Pow-   MARRYING A PEACE.      213 hattan was indignant. It was the end of all nego- tiation and diplomacy on his part. The Governor and' Council now resolved upon another step. They would send his  daughter to his door; if he would not then deliver what was demanded for her ransom, they would resort to force. Having waited till the spring of 1613, Sir Thomas Dale was sent to Werowocomoco in Argall's ship, with a hundred and fifty men., well armed, and having Pocahontas in charge. Rolfe went with them, of course. They were received with defiance by the Powhattans; but, after some skirmishing and hut- burning, a truce was agreed upon ifor one day. This brief time was diligently improved. Master Rolfe and Master Sparkes were sent to Powhattan, and two brothers of Pocahontas visited her on shipboard. The result was nothing but a promise from Ope- chancanough, (the messengers were not admitted to the presence of Powhattan,) and another from the two brothers, that they would urge Powhattan to accede to the overtures and terms of the English. With these bald promises Dale was obliged to con- tent himself, - for the time for planting having come,- he had no leisure for fighting. He therefore returned to Jamestown, consenting to wait Powhattan's humor until the harvest. Thus far, both the diplomacy and the generalship of the dignitaries had been foiled by a heathen savage, who had strength of character enough to curb the impulses of his own heart, and craft enough for a reserved and temporizing policy. To negotiate and to conquer a peace the great folks had failed. The lesser ones now took the. matter in hand.

Rolfe confided his to Sir Thomas Dale. "There is but one remedy," said Dale.  "There is only one," said Gates. ' Only one," said Powhattan.     ,           W ' Precisely one," said Rolfe.               : Pocahontas said nothing in particular; at least, , nothing aloud.  But she never contradicted Rolfe. So within ten days, " tlc remedy "- a very simple  though a very serious ceremony -was applied.' Pow-  hattan sent Opachisco, an old uncle of Pocahontas, as  his deputy, and also two of his sons, to see " the man-    . ner of the marriage, and to doe in that behalfe what they were requested, for the confirmationi thereof." It was solemnized before the altar at- Jamestown, and     I according to, the rites of the Church of England, early   ! in the monlth of Ap:ril.*            ei Now " an oath for confirmation is to men an end of all strife." Here was an oath,- a marriage oath to be sure; but in that consisted its peculiar charm  and efficacy; for it involved a pledge of amity and'  fidelity between allthe parties concerned. It was a bond of union, an alliance of interests, between two  families,-the English and the Powhattans.    Thus  a peace was a matter of course. It was not agreed upon; it was understood. It involved no compulsion, X' Some time previous to her marriage, "before the font which was hewn out of the trunk of a tree, hollowed into the shape of a canoe, the Princess Pocahontas had openly renounced her country's idolatry, pro-' fessed the faith of Jesus Christ, and been baptized" by the name of Rebecca. - Lippincott's Cabinet History.   MARRYING A PEACE.       215 no repulsive terms, nothing derogatory to the kingly honor of Powhattan.  Nothing was said, or done, about a treaty, nothing about restoration, nothing about reparation. The parties did not dictate, or stipulate, or buy, or conquer, a peace. They married it.  I do thee wed" was " the end of all strife." "And euer since '-since the marriage - wee haue had friendly trade and commerce, as well with Pow- hattan himselfe as all his subjects." Such is the record, and nothing more. But besides this, and because of this,' the tribe of the Chickahominies -  a lusty and daring people, free of themselves"- - voluntarily proposed a treaty of friendship and alliance, which was promptly ef- fected; they paying a small annual tribute, claiming to be called Englishmen and true subjects of King James and his deputies, and receiving from the Eng- lish a pledge of protection against any enemy what- soever. This also was an effect of Pocahontas's marriage. What the governor and his advisers, the captains and their soldiers, tried to do, but could not, was thus taken out of their hands, commenced anew in the school-room of the Gospel of Christ, and finally perfected and ratified at the altar. What the law of coercion could not do, in that it was weak through the' inborn wilfulness of Powhattan, Divine Provi- dence did.

In 1613, the five years expired which the king, in his instructions, had prescribed for trade in common  stock, and for bringing the whole fruit of their labors         A into common storehouses.     Sir Thomas Dale, under the magistracy of Gates, took advantage of this fact,  and introduced changes by which the colonists began  to acquire property in the soil, and property in time;  in each more or less, according, probably, to the cir- cumstances of their immigration.      Every man-as noticed at the close of our twelfth chapter--      had at least three acres of land, to be cultivated at his option, and  for his personal benefit.    This allotment was accompanied with an allowance to      each holder, per year, of one month of his time, and two bushels of  corn from  the public stock; for which he must render eleven months of labor for the store.    But as early as 1617, the number of this class was reduced to fifty-  four, men, women, and children. vice on the Sabbath, and for neglect of catechising, first offence, loss of  provision and allowance for the whole week following; second offence, loss of said allowance, and whipping; third offence, death.

For throwing slops or rinsing a kettle within certain prescribed limits, "whipping, and further punishment as shall be thought meete by the censure of a martiall court." Such legislation was not characteristic of. Puritanism or of Episco- pacy: it was characteristic of the age.   ANNALS.        219 The settlers at New Bermuda, - five miles from Henrico, and on the river Appamattuck, - and some others, rendered but one month's service, but not in seed-time or harvest, and two and a half barrels of corn. Sir Thomas Gates returned to England in March, 1614, leaving the government of the colony in the hands of Sir Thomas Dale. Dale's administration, although rigorously martial, was distinguished also for good judgment. 'With in- defatigable perseverance, and almost miraculously, he reclaimed the idle and dissolute ' to labor and an hon- est fashion of life." He was particularly careful for the planting of corn; and succeeded to the extent, that he largely supplied the necessities of the Indians. The cultivation of tobacco now commenced; and such was the eagerness of the colonists in this new experi- ment, that Dale found it necessary to interfere. He forbade the setting of any tobacco, until a certain quantity of ground, to each person in a household, had first been planted with corn. No other incidents worthy of particular notice oc- curred during his government, which continued until the spring of 1616; when he sailed for England, in company with Rolfe and Pocahontas, and left "Cap- tain George Yeardley to be deputy-governor in his absence." Yeardley had neither the controlling efficiency nor the wisdom of his predecessor; consequently the colo- nists gave the rein to their new conceit for the culture of tobacco. Indeed, the Governor himself partook of the popular enthusiasm. Hitherto a revenue had been sought for by the manufactare of clapboards    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6802-00000115"/> 220   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. and wainscoting, potash and tar, soap and glass, by  the cultivation of the vine, and the exportation of yellow earth. But for all except the first two of these, the cost had been greater than the receipts. Yeardley now directed the colonists to the cultivation of tobacco, "as the most present commoditie they could deuise for a present gaine." In this there was soon as much eagerness as formerly there had been in hunting gold. The people had no interruption through I fear of the Indians. Indeed, such was their sense of security, that they admitted the daily visits, not only  of the Powhattans and the Chickahominies, but of "divers other nations," who. sometimes guided the Englishl on hunting excursions, and sometimes hunted for them. Ycardley unwisely trained, and allowed   i others to train, several Indians to the expert use of the musket, that. they might provide food for the table.  The intercourse between the natives and the 9olo-  nists was thus free and unrestrained during the whole twelvemonth of Yeardley's administration. Heretofore every immigrant, and every one who had inhtoduced immigrants at his own expense, had been entitled to a hundred acres of land, personal adventure, for each, - the land to be set off at some future day, which was the utmost that could be granted in any single share. But such prosperity had accrued through the means and influence of Sir Thomas Dale, that less bounty was thought sufficient inducement for settlers. Now, therefore, but fifty acres' bounty was offered to future immigrants, and to those who; previously to June 24th, 1625, should de- fray the expenses of immigrants, with the privilege of adding thereto, when occupied and cultivated, fifty   ANNALS.         221 acres more. Lands might also be granted to any person who might have been a special benefactor to the Company or to the colony, but'not exceeding two thousand acres. Besides, every Iperson who should pay twelve and a half pounds ste!ling Into the treas- ury of the Company could obtain a title to a hundred acres. Captain Samuel Argall arrived in May, 1617, em- powered by the Company to act as Deputy-Governor. With the sole and sinister design of securing to him- self and his abettors sudden and enormous profits, at whatever expense of humanity or honesty, he hadf been appointed to this post of trust and power through' the intrigues and desperate efforts of a faction headed by Lord Rich, soon afterwards created Earl of War- wick. rgrall and Rich were pocket-partners in the scheme to wring money from the colonial enterprise. The better to secure their end, Argall was also consti- tuted Admiral of the country and seas adjoining. He was received by. "Yeardiey and h is companie in a martiall order, whose right-hand file was led by an Indian." Yeardley immediately returned to England. The colony was now  in a singular condition. There were about four hundred setItlers in the coun- try, and they had a live stock of a hundred and twen- ty-.eight cattle, eighty-eight goats, and innumerable swine; and "iL some places go-  enty of core." But the peop were scattered everywhere, possessed with a mania br the cultivation of tobacco. Every- thing else was neglected.' Indians were as often in the houses as the planters themselves; they had a great many English arms in their possession, and were skilled in their use. In Jamestown there were remain- 19*    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6802-00000116"/> 222   THE' YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. ing but four or five houses; the palisades were not sufficient to keep out the hogs; the well of fresh water was spoiled; the church had tumbled down, and the storehouse was used in its stead. The market-place was overgrown with tobacco. The streets were rank with tobacco. Every nook and corner was usurped by tobacco,. The whole population, in town and coun- try, on plantations and on bits of choice land in the wilds, planted it, nursed it, cured it, talked about it by  day, and dreamed about it by night. The dilapidation of the colony Argall set himself to repair; the people of the colony, to tyrannize over and oppress. Constituted both military and naval  commander, and ruling where the only law was mar-  tial law, aid being himself an avaricious, exacting,  arbitrary man, he had all the apparatus and qualities of a despot, and was admirably fitted for the purposes for which his election had been obtained. He proved it. Extortion and oppression were the watchwords of his policy. He monopolized the trade with the In- dians for his own benefit; he forced the tenants, the servants, theIships, of the Company, and the old plant- ers also, upon his own employments; he embezzled  the public cattle and. stoies; he tried by court-martial, and condemned to death, one Captain Brewster, for endeavoring to withdraw from Argalls busineso the servants on Lord Delaware's plantation, whom Brew- ster had in charge; * for trifling offences he condemned the colonists to confiscations and to limited servitude; * Some of the court, joining with the clergy, after much entreaty prevailed with Argall to spare the life of Brewster. The latter appealed to the Treasurer and Company in England, by whom he was promptly and honorably acquitted. Stith, 153, 182.   ANNALS.'        223. and even innocent persons he capriciousilysubjected to punishment. ' Complaints were repaide with stripes; moneys, with scoffs; and tortures were made delights." This intolerable state of things continued until about the 1st of April, 1619, when a little pinnace arrived privately from England for Captain Argall. She was sent by his noble accomplice, now the Earl of Warwick; and her despatches informed him that his tyranny and 'nalpractices had come to the know l- edge of the Company, that the pinnace was sent for his escape, and that he had better use her accordingly. He did so; and " within foure or five daiss 2 was off leaving Captain Powell as his deputy. But, though he went to England and braved investigation, through the intrigues and influence of Warwick he escaped unwhipped. On the 18th, ten or twelvedays afterwards, Yeard- ley - now Sir George'- arrived, having been ap- pointed Captain-General of the colony in place of Lord Delaware, who had died in 1.618, on his way to resume the duties of his office in"Virginia. The colo- nists were ravished Wiith joy at their deliverance from tyranny, and by the news that ample supplies, which they much needed, were on the way. "They thought themselves now fully satisfied for their long toil and labors, and as happy men as any in. the world." Hitherto the colonists had been more or less the serfs of a mercantile corporation, and precluded from all political rights in the community which they con- stituted. Since the establishment of martial law by Dale in 1611, - a measure for which there seem to have been imperative reasons,--they had not had,    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6802-00000117"/> 224   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.  even under accusations for capital offences, the right of trial by jury. "The necessities of the times, the ignorance of the people, and the oppression and tyran- ny of their governors, had thus far deprived them of the liberties and privileges of Englishmen, to which they had a right by the charters of the Company."  ! But now the bondage wa at an end. Every vestige of serf-dues was swept away; tribute of corn and tribute of labor, fronm the planters, were at an end; each man had the shares of land due to him. set off. to hold and to enjoy, to him and his heirs; they held property of every sort by a tenure as secure and as in- dependent as if residents in England;. the Governor, . no longer a despotic official, but under the check of a Council, could do wrong tq no man who might not have speedy remedy; the folns :of justice and trial by jury were 'established; and the statute law of Eng- land took the place of martial law. These changes were made by Yeardley in virtue of powers vested in ( him by the Company, and expressly for these pur- poses. But this was not all. The colonists were even called upon to share ii the high matter of legislation. This Yeardley did without authority, though he proba- bly knew that he was acting according to the spirit which now pervaded the Company.  He convoked an Assembly of Representatives, Which met in June, and "debated all mnatters thought expedient for the good of the colony." The people were divided into boroughs or townships," elven in number, each of which sent two Representatives. These, together with the Governor and .Council, -which he had or- ganized immediately upon his arrival, -constituted        .   THE ASSEMBLY.       225 THE FIRST COLONIAL ASSEMBLY of North America; the grain of seed since become a treeaeneath which all the nations of the earth gather together and rest. Although the acts of this Assembly could not be authoritative and binding without being ratified by the London Company, and although it does not ap- pear that the ratification took place, yet their moral influence was incalculable. It was "-a shadow of good things to come." The Virginians had plucked of the tree of the knowledge of political good and evil, but had hitherto only tasted of its fruit. Now they had broken its bitter rind, and penetrated to its grateful pulp. It was their first discovery of the good, and they never forgot it. It quickened within them an instinct heretofore repressed and paralyzed. It brought a Hercules from embryo life to infancy, des- tined to throttle the serpent. Though it had placed the people only in the outer porch of the temple of Liberty, it had opened their eyes to. the glories within, and they never ,went back. Like a draught from the cup of the gods, it darted through their veins, a palpi- tating currentrwhich they have transmitted, undegen- erated, unabated, and uncooled, to the present gener- ation.  May not even an accumulation of metaphor be pardoned, when inscribing and pondering the initia- tory act of American Independence? The inspiration of these several events was imme- diately felt. The colonists began to call what they labored for, their own; with right good-will they built houses, and displayed satisfaction and honest pride in their construction ; they held the plough with cheer- fulness and zeal, and wielded the hoe with alacrity;    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6802-00000118"/> 226   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. in short, they set themselves with manly vigor to every- practicable form of productive industry, and "the colonyr began to have the face and fashion of an orderly state." ", Our greatest possible thankes to the Company for the care that hath beene taken for the setling of the Plantation," was passed in their Assembly by acclamation. Sir Edwin Sandys, this year the Treasurer of the London Company, and upon whom     the burden of their affairs officially devolved, a man of remarkable energy and shrewdness, was- ardently and even hero-. ically devoted to the interests of the colony. Ear- nestly revolving ir his mind the great problem  of its prosperity arid permanence, instead of consulting ledgers, lottery schemes,@ or mercantile speculators, he- threw himself upon his own resources as a man of common sense, and    surveyed  the actual condition of the colonists in the light of humanity and nature. To a mind in this attitude, it was obvious at a' glance that as yet there was no organization of true society in Virginia; that its natural and essential element, the inspiring and conservative influence of woman, was wanting.    ' He wondered   not," he said, in a great and general quarter-meeting of the Company in November, " that the people of Virginia x The first lottery ever known in the kingdom of Great Britain was granted for the Company, when Sir Thomas Smith was their Treasurer, to aid their Virginia enterprise.

He won- dered not that they proposed, after having got some wealth, to return again to England, nor that such restlessness tended to the utter overthrow anl disso- lution of the plantation. The men had nothing to fix and settle them upon the soil. They had no homes, in the true English sense; no family ties to the glebe on which they sojourned; no endearing asscociations between their hearts and the visible objects around them. But very few Englishwomen had been there, for men would not take wives to a foreign wilder- ness, where they themselves purposed only an uncer- tain resideiice." Such were the arguments' by which he earnestly enforced his "third proposition " to the assembled Company, "that one hundred maids, young and uncorrupt, should be sent over the next spring to make wives for the inhabitants." Accordingly, ninety young women of good 1620. character and aspect were persuaded to go "to *  make wives," and were sent out early in 1620. So weli did this consignment succeed, (of course it would!) that the next year sixty more were sent for the same benign and politic purpose. Great must have been the amazement, and great the welcome, with which this novel merchandise was greeted on 'the shores of Virginia by the wifeless tenants of her soil. The devotees of tobacco even dropped their hoes and deserted their pet plants, so eager were they to inspect and appropriate the new importation. Maidens who came purposely and pro- fessedly "to make wives" need not be approached with bashfulness, or won by the mystic arts of court-    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6802-00000119"/> 228 '  THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. ship. So they were all quickly bespoken.   Yet they were not to be had for the mere bespeaking.    They were ' merchandise."   They were for sale.   If any one was 'married to a tenant, or farmer, of any public land, he could have her freely; the Company would defray the charges of her transportation.  To others who were freemen and tenants,    servants should not have any, -- they were for sale.  Their expenses must be paid at least; perhaps, too, something for choice- money, and something for the profit of the shippers.' But what were such considerations to men who could be thus diverted from  their absorbing pursuit? only "they had no moneye"!    "What then?   They had tobacco."  "Would the shippers receive tobacco?" "Yes, they would receive tobacco, - a hundred and twenty pounds for a young, comely, uncorrupt maid-. :en, well recommended by the Company!      At such a price, a gift surely, to a homeless, bachelor farmer in a strange land! Each one with her own recom- mendations and testimonials too! so that purchasers can judge 'and choose." So the farmers examined the faces and the certifi- cates, and judged, and chose, and paid the price, and took unto themselves wives.    Now  they were "MEN," as the Episcopal service "pronounces"' those, * The price was one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco, at three shillings, - equivalent to eighteen pounds sterling. The cost of trans- portation was about six pounds sterling, leaving a profit to the shippers of twelve pounds sterling to each woman; They were shipped, for the most part, by a society of trade distinct from the Company, but nomi- nally under their control, called "The Magazine," or the subscribers by "Roll."

SERVANTS,        229 who conceitedly think themselves men before mar- riage, to have become, in virtue of the marriage rite. Now they had homes.   And ithen, in process of time, came certain native Angloi-Virginians, --little tent-pins, holding the farmers' tabernacles securely to the soil; the very thing which Sir Edwin Sandys thought they would do. Thanks to his sagacity! the Virginians became " settled in their minds." But a sense of home, and fixture upon the soil, were not the only salutary results. The rudeness, restiveness, and turbulence of a mere male population subsided; -and more industry, more frugality, more thrift ensued,-- all natural consequences. Bonded or covenant service had been early intro- duced into the colony. Boys and girls were sent out, under indentures, to be " servants and apprentices" to tenants of the public lands, and to the old planters. Men and women also were sent out, under covenants, as " servants to be disposed of among the old planters"; and all other persons who went out, not defraying the expenses of their own passages, "' must, by a law of the. country, serve, if men and women, four years, if younger, according to their years "; but if under con- tract, before leaving England, for a longer term of service, then they would be bound for the term speci- fied in the contract. In 1619, Kitng James peremp- torily ordered&amp; the Company to transport "one hun- dred dissolute persons to 'be servants." The sending over of rascals and paupers, which is continued to the present day, was an early policy of England. From all such, service of labor was due, for specified terms of time, in the colony.

Virginia--often a large advance upon       the cost of transportation   -- entitled the purchaser, or master, to the entire time and powers of the immigrant until the debt was cancelled.    The profit became a temp- tation to unprincipled men to act as shippers of ap- prentices or covenanted servants.     Thus, in process 'of time, children were sold by poor parents; many were stolen from   their parents for the purpose of sale to shippers; many were     stolen by  shippers them- selves; magistrates thus disposed of young vagrants, and  even  convicted  innocent men, for the good of their own pockets.    The business became a regular trade in various parts of Great Britain, -   in Aberdeen, in' Bristol, in London, in   Dublin, and other places.

"Four years' service was required by law for the payment of transporta- tion"' (Leah and Rachel, p. 11, in Force); and "a man's labors" says Stith (p. 163), "was computed at ten pounds sterling a year." Compare these facts with Captain Smith's language, addressed to the royal com- missioners in 1623: "The general complaint saith that pride,'covetous- nesse, extortion, and oppression in a few that ingrosscs all, then sell all againe to the comminalty at what rate they please, yea, euen men, women, and children, for who will giue most, occasions no small mischiefe amongst the Planters."

SERVANTS.           231 they were to revel in numberless delights, but where in reality they were to be plunged into the miseries of compulsory servitude."*   The system affordedl a con- venient channel for disposing of persons convicted of political disturbances or political heresies, even down to the time of George the Second, if not later.     It was also convenient for getting rid of young heirs, to the advantage of the next heirs-at-law t "The condition of apprenticed servants in Virginia differed from that of slaves chiefly in the duration of their bondage," though it was inot impracticable on slight pretensions to effect an extension of the bond- age in certain cases. Btit a histpry of this matter is a digression.   It is sufficient to note the fact, that, under color of legal apprenticeship, a real and involuntary enslavement of free-born Britons existed in   Virginia in 1620, an1 previously.  Hence, when, in ALugust of that year, a Dutch: ship brought a gang of Africans to the shores of James River for sale, the' offer was only of black in lieu of white, with the single addition of unlimited servie.  With compulsory servitude the Virginians were already familiar, and it seemed rather an act of good brotherhood than otherwise, to    substitute the alien for the countryman, the Negro for the Caucas- ' Mackintosh's English Revolution, 179.

But whether any questions of casuistry were. mooted or not, it -was done; and the twenty Africans were sold and bought.  The end is not yet. During the administration of Yeardley, a donation was made to the treasury of the Company by' an "( unknown person in England, for the bringing up of the savage children in Christianity."  Another gave ~ by will three hundred pounds to the College, to be paid when there shall be ten young saluages placed in it; in the meane time, foure and twenty pound yeerly, to be distribvted vnto three discreete and godly 'young men in the colony, to bring vp three wilde young infidels in some good course of life."' In regard to this spiritual enterprise, upon which the Company :ifi their appeals enlarged not a little, one 'I Master Janas Stockam, a minister in Virginia," seenms to have been rather faithless.' In a letter to the Council and Company in England, dated M5ay 28th, 1.621, having first gravely raised the question whether they sought the conversion of the savages for the glory of God, or through a desire of tho*gain which they hoped might flow to them as a reward for their proselyting., he added as follows:- "'.As for the gifts bestowed upon them [the sav- ages], they deuoure them, and so they would the giuers if they could; and though many haue en-   PROSELYTING.       233 deuoured by all the meanes they could by kindnesse to conuerte them, they finde nothing from them but derision and ridiculous answers. We haue sent boies amongst them to learne their language, but they re- turne worse than they went; but I am no states- man, nor love I to meddle with anything but my bookes, but I can finde no probability by this course to draw them [the savages] to goodnesse; and I am perswaded, if Mars and Minerua goe hand in ha'nd, they will effect more good in an houre, than those verball Mercurians in their liues; and till their priests and ancients haue, their throats cut, there is no hope to bring them to conuersion." On this singularly Christian letter Captain Smith commented thus: "For the saluages vncertaine con- formitie [to the church] I do not wonder, but for their constancy and conuersion I am and ener haue beene of the opinion of Master lonas Stockam." TrWhitaker, " the apostle," was of the same opinion with Stockam and Smith. A second General Assembly was convened in May of this year; of whose doings, however, we have no record. For certain malicious by-ends of their own, the Earl of -Warwick and Captain Argall--now the head of a troublesome faction in the London Com- pany -had caused it to be reported in Virginia, and even to be told to Opechancanough, that the government of the colony was about to devolve upon Warwick, who would call Yeardley to severe ac- count, and to signal punishment, for maladministra- tion. Yeardley was a man too sensitive and amiable to bear the brunts and emergencies of his very pecu- 20*    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6802-00000122"/> 234   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.  liar post; and this rumor, which was variously con- firned, wrought in him such extreme dejection, as to induce a long and severe sickness, and of course to retard and embarrass the machinery of his govern- ment. For this reason, probably; though perhaps in connectioli with others, he desired the Company to release him from his duties when the term: for which he was appointed should have expired, which would be in November of 1621. Sir Francis Wyatt was therefore elected Governor, - "a young gentleman thought every way sufficient and equal to the place, and highly esteemed on account of his birth, educa- tion, integrity of life, and fair fortune." He left Eng- land with his commission about the 1st of August, 1621.   CHAPTER XV. OVER THE WATER. WE now go back a little in the order of time, and pass over to the old and bustling 1616 metropolis of England. Late in June, or perhaps in the early part of July, 1616, there was a lady sitting in a richly furnished apartment in London, who had some connection with the events of our narrative. She appeared to be about forty years of age, which was less than two years short of the truth. Her face was but indifferently handsome, -an aquiline nose a little drooping to- wards the mouth, a clear complexion, and rich brown eyes, just then rather heavy in their expression, though' usually lively. Her hair was elaborately curled and frizzled, dressed high, and decked sparingly with jew- els. Her dress was a rich, heavy silk brocade, the bodice tight; and forming a waist five inches longer than natural. The corsage of her gown was cut very low, but the bosom was covered with a transparent chemisette and a Brussels lace collar, and cuffs of the same material in three tiers ornamented her wrists. She wore the preposterous appendage of the day,- a farthingale, - so enormous that her very beautiful hands 'rested upon itr verge, when her arms were extended. She had no companion but a pet grey- hound, of a diminutive breed, which lay at her feet,    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6802-00000123"/> 236   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.  having around its neck an ornamented collar, on- which were embossed in gold the letters A. R. The lady had the appearance of one worn by cares. Indeed, she had a troubled look, as though some jagged thoughts were even then working their way through her mind. She seemed abstracted, and gave no sign of life other than a sigh, or a flitting contrac- tion of her brow and lip, as if she were in pain. At last she rose,- with what awkwardness and diffi- culty may be imagined,- and walked nervously to one of the large windows. She looked upoo the bright green lawn, glanced at some sombre build- ings and turrets beyond, and instantly turned back again. There was nothing cheering out of doors, for there was no sunshine. It was shut out by smoke and clouds. Observing by a timepiece in the apartment that it was almost noon, she sadly reseated herself, and took up a letter which had lain open by her side. She had read it before, but she commenced reading it again with evident interest. While she was thus engaged, a folding door of the apartment was thrown open from without by two men in rich apparel. A man entered without word or ceremony, the two attendants disappeared, and the door was closed. He was fifty years of age, of mid- dling stature, misshapen by the rickets just enough to give him an uncouth form, and had a countenance, even in its best state, disagreeably homely. Just now it was not in its best state; for, besides first a rolling, aand then an idiotic stare, of his large eyes,-- actions which were habitual with him,--he had a decidedly drunken look. Not that he was tipsy then; but he looked as though he had been, thoroughly,   OVER THE WATER.          237 when he went to bed, and had just risen to shame, re- 'pentance, and the headache. His dress was green from head to foot, of the same shade as the vigorous grass out of the window.   He looked as though he was a fat man, but he was not. His face, -   it was bloated; and his clothes, - they were stuffed with quilted pad- ding, I don't know how thick; but so thick that the ordinary daggers of the time, if they should    prick through to the skin, could not penetrate much farther. He was very much afraid of being stabbed; no one knew why, although some wiseacres said it was be- cause, just before he was born, a man was stabbed to death in his mother's presence, and he had never got over the fright.  In those days every man wore a  sword who pretended to be a gentleman, which he, through a very great error of judgment, thought him- self to be. But he had as natural a dislike to swords as he had to shorter weapons for stabbing, and wore instead, and in the place of one, a richly ornamented hunting-horn. He loved dogs and hunting dearly; it was said, better than he loved anybody in the world, or anything but eating and drinking and lying in bed." He made a peevish    sign to the lady, who was beginning the operation of rising, that she should remain seated, and advanced with an awkwAard and uncertain step, as though his legs were too weak for his body;-  and they were.   The slightest possible look of sorrow passed upon the lady's face, but it im- mediately gave way to a good-natured expression, her , Hume's History of England; Neal's History of the Puritans; Strick- land's Queens of England, Vol. VII. pp. 344, 345, 349 - 351; Dickens's Child's History of England; Aikman's Buchanan's Scotland, H. 384.              ,           .    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6802-00000124"/> 238   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. eyes beaming with their natural vivacity, and betray- ing a spirit anything but tame or diffident. Her hus- band adjusted himself upon a seat, after an ungainly process, sheepishly looked down upon the floor, and fumbled uneasily at his dress. "I am sorry for you, Jemmy," said the lady, refold- ing her letter; "but you should be more on 'your guard, man. You had such bitter shame and sorrow after that terrible debauch with brother Christiern at Theobalds, that I thought you would have profited by the lesson. Ten years 'to be sure; but not long enough for such a tiling to be forgotten. , And yet how many times since have you done just so?" Jernmmy was in the habit of swearing like a trooper, and of largely spicing his conversation with Latin. We omnit the Latin and the oaths. "I dinna ken, I dinna ken,"' he replied, with a clumsy articulation. His tongue was too big for his mouth. He always spake so. ' I canna hald frae swearing! Ani uncannie chiel! an uncannie chiel! And he began to cry.  ' You are not uncannie, Jemmy; you are not un- cannie,' said the lady in a soothing tone. "There is not your equal in all England-or Scotland." "Ay, ay! I could gie the teachings o' wisdom to a' in the twa kingdoms. But Solomon himsel had his weakness.

Gude forgie me!"And he wept and blubbered like a child. And thus, while the fit was on him, he snivelled   OVER THE WATER..       239 forth his morning penitence, wringing his hands, and ejaculating sneaking prayers "that God would not impute his infirmities to him." His wife, who really loved him, had hardly succeeded in bringing him to tolerable composure, when two more persons were ushered into their presence. One of them was a very handsome young man, twenty-two years of age, with a genteel air and fash- ionable apparel, and radiant with diamonds, - dia- monds in his cap, diamonlds in his ear-rings, and dia- monds on his shoes. The other was a youth of six- teen years, of a very modest and cwinning appearance; his countenance wearing an almost imperceptible shade of melancholy when in repose,* but lively, fresh, 'and ingenuous when animated by conversation. Was a hazy presentiment of .a stormy life and a tragip death already creeping over his young spirit, and spreading its pall over his features? "Steenie! Charlie!" exclaimed Jemmy, as the two entered, " ye 're the light o' my een; bonnie and braw as twa fresh-blawTn roses!" "Welcome, my little servant!" said the lady to the younger, using a term which she whimsically chose to express her affection to her son f' : My dear mother," replied the lad impetuously, 4 I have come to ask whether you will receive the prin- cess. Have you read the letter?" 4 Yes, child, I have read the letter.'

Even so brief an approach to the domestic life and character of James the First of England, makes one feel defiled and heart-sick. Such royalty looks better out of ear-shot. It is sufficient to remark, that the wrath of James against young Mr. Rolfe, for his presumption in yok- ing himself with royalty, " passed - off without any further bad consequence than a little displeasure and murmuring"; as did also his apprehensions that the husband of Pocahontas might lay claim to the crown of Virginia. Pocahontas, or, as she was called in England, the Lady Rebecca, had arrived at Plymouth on the 12th of June, having in her train several young Indians of both sexes, and devoted with all the fresh and trenmu- lous love of a new mother to the comfort and. the marvellous developments of an infant Thomas. She had acquired a fair command of the English language, had easily adopted the habits and manners of civilized life, and was well instructed in Christianity. Her journey of two hundred and sixteen miles to London was necessarily slow, partly because of the ill-con- structed roads and the lumbering vehicles of the day, and partly because of the hospitalities which she en- ' Strickland, VII. 349.

Great was the curiosity of all classes to behold the natives of the New World, and particularly the beautiful scion of barbaric royalty, the first Chris- tian of her nation, the first who had wedded an Eng- lishnran and borne him a-child. In the eyes of the crowd, all were national trophies; a kinid of first-fruit offering at the shrine of English greatness, types and pledges of a growing empire, which not only grati- fied English curiosity, but tickled English pride. Yet there were others who, while they shared in these pop- ular sentiments, greeted the stranger princess with English heartiness for ler own sake, as the :heroic savior of their countrymen, as the beautiful child of Nature, and a' rare emboodiment of female virtues. All strove, to do her holior. The London Company made appropriations for the generous maintenance of herself and her child; and her society was eagerly sought by families of the highest rank and of un- bending pride. The noise and the smoky atmosphere 6of Loindon so illy agreed with one always accustomed to the stillness and the pure air of the forest, that Pocahon- tas was immediately removed to Brantford, a short distance fromi the city. As soon} as Captain Smith heard of her being established, lie hastened to wel- come her, taking with him a party of his friends. It is undoubtedly true, though not stated in Smith's account of the interview, that he. met her with the ceremonious deference and reserve appropriate to the character in which she appeared, and to the sphere in which she was then noving, but in strong contrast to the frank and easy cordiality which had marked their interviews in the 'wilderness. This she instantly per-   OVER THE WATER.      245 ceived. It keenly wounded her sensitive nature. Her heart had bounded toward the man whom she had known in her father's lodge, whom she had re- peatedly saved from death, from. whom she had al- ways received the most cordial and parental saluta- tions, and whom she had ever regarded with childlike reverence and trust. But formality in him! she had not dreamed of it. It was chilling, cutting, stunning; for she had lost none of the simplicity, none of the affectionateness, none of the sensitiveness, which had marked her elastic childhood. The open warmth of the rough soldier had always gladdened her; the English iciness of the precise visitor smote upon her heart. She could not comprehend it., She re- turnedt it by a passionless and silent salutation, turned directly about, and covered her face with her hands. From this, grieved and wordless humor she would not be dissuaded, so that Rolfe and the visitors left her, much to the mortification of Smith. After two or three hours they returned, when she began to talk. "I see you are other than you used to be. I was but a little girl, yet I did save your life and the lives of your people whenever I could. Though I did not know God then, he moved my heart to love you and your people, and to take care of you.* Then you used to smile, and put your hand. on my head, and look in my eyes, and say, ' God bless you, my child!'

"'I see you have forgotten Pocahbntas.* You came to see the Lady Rebecca. She was here then," -al- luding to her own coolness and silence,- but she is gone now. This is Pocahontas, Captain Smiith- your child."  "I did, come to see Pocahontas,' Smith replied, kindly. "I] have riot forgotten her. I have not for- gotten what she did when my head lay upon the stone in her father's lodge. I have not forgotten what she did for my people when they had no food; I have not forgotten what she did in' the lonesome woods and in the dark night. She was as an angel of mercy whom God sent.  But here it is not proper that a poor soldier should conduct hiihself towards a king's daughter as though he were her equal." ' King's daughter here; king's daughter there.

Therefore I am afraid that you should call me ' Father,' or to call you Child.' " T4le idea was so absurdly ludicrous, that the seri- ousniess and grief of Pocahontas gave way, and she brolie into a ringing laugh. "Afraid!" said she.  "Who ever dared to say that Captain Smith was afraid!    It is silly. Were you afrail in  my country, among many strangers and terrible warriors?  No.  You  made all afraid but me.  How, then, can you be afraid among your own countrymien, and afraid of such a harmless thing as that I should call you 'Father'?

Charles, related to Queen Anne by letter the history of her relations and services to the colonists. After other conversation, he took his leave for the present; the sensitive princess relieved of the grief which the formality of their meeting had induced. They had frequent interviews afterwards, for Smith was daily importuned for an introduction to her, by persons connected with the royal court, and by others. It was a gay, frivolous, heartless world to which  Pocahontas was now introduced; but its shifting scenes, its glitter, its novelty, served effectually to 'blind her to its hollowness and misery, so that " she. was wonderfully pleased and delighted." For the brief term of her visit, her native and now matured purity was a sufficient shield against its contamina- tion, and of course its sting. So transparent was her goodness, and so natural and simple her dignity of manner, that the proudest and wickedest approached her with profound respect, and the boldest felt that there was a line beyond which they might not ad- vance. At masks, at balls, at theatres, she was a chief object of attraction; but neither viscount, earl, or duke presumed upon her simplicity. Though a wife and a mother, she had yet the loveliness and the sanctity of a child. In artificial society, she seemed like a modest and graceful lily, a pure and peerless product of Nature, fresh and fragrant, to whom the rank and gorgeous nurslings of the hot-house paid instinctive homage. Through means of -Smith's let- ter to Queen Anne, she was introduced to their Majesties by Lord and Lady Delaware. The whole court were surprised and charmed by the propriety and grace of her deportment; and even the sottish ,    '   OVER THE WATER.'       249 James was roused to sentiments of esteem, and con- ceded to her the position of a royal princess. She was frequently admitted to private interviews with the queen, and was publicly treated as the daughter of a sovereign prince. Thus she passed away the winter of 1616 - 17, the pride of a husband who loved her with passionate devotion, and admired by all for the beauty of her person and the loveliness of her character. Early in the spring,-it appears to leave been about the 1st of March,- Captain Argall sail d from Graves- end, near the mouth of the Thames, for Virginia. While waiting in that port to go in his ship to her native land, Pocahontas was suddenly arrested by a power from which there was no deliverance. She fell sick, and soon perceived that :Death stood at the door. As husband and friends m1oved about in con- sternation and in tears, her- childlike spirit was trans- figured before them, and Was clad in raiment of light. Behold, it was '; the spirit of adoption '! When she yearned to see once more the rivers and forests where she used to play, and the aged chief who used to delight in her infant glee, and to lay her body by the graves of her woodland fathers, it whis- pered, "Thy will, O God! not mine;" and the long- ing was stilled.  When she took leave of' husband and child, it mur- mured, "Even so, Father!'. and she was peaceful. And then she looked trustfully, steadfastly, upon the Offering for sin, - a "Thankls thanks! for the unspeakable Gift!" in her heart,--until, unsullied by a fashionable and wicked world, she sweetly fell asleep.                 .i    <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6802-00000130"/> 250    THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Her name, like   a  drop of dew, or a    perpetual flower, on a hoary ruin, is yet fresh and refreshing on the page of history; and the memory of her un- pretending life is like the memory of a heavenly vision.' * Pocahontas died at twenty-two years of age. Her son, Thomas Rolfe, "afterwards came to America, where he became a gentleman of great distinction, and possessed an ample fortune. He left an only daughter, who married Colonel Robert 13oiling, and died leaving an only son, Major John Bolling, who was the father ,of Colonel John Bolling and several daughters; one of whom married Colonel Richard Randolph, from whom was descended the late John Randolph of Vir- ginia," so distinguished both for his character and his talents.

The policy which he was instructed to pursue denotes much vigor and political sagacity on the part of the Company; yet betrays the same peculiarities for which the New England colonies have been stigmatized. Religious worship and rites ac- cording to the canons of Episcopacy; the honor and rights and respect of the clergy; " the avoiding "- a soft but ambiguous word--" of all factious and need- less, novelties "; loyalty; the prompt and equal ad- ministration of justice according to the forms and constitution of England; peace and friendship with the natives, and their protection from wrong; popu- lar industry; the suppression of gaming, drunken- ness, and "excess of apparel" ;t--  all these, among other matters, were expressly enjoined. This last item excited some sensation in' the col- * Meaning Puritanism particularly. t It may be a question whether the language of the Company on this point savors most of Puritanical preciseness a nd overmuch righteous- ness, or of Episcopalian jealousy for the privileges of rank. "No per- son, except the Council, or the Heads of Hundreds and Plantations, with their Wives and Children, shall wear Gold on their Cloaths, or any Apparel of Silk, except such as has been raised by their own In- dustry." -Stith, 194.    <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6802-00000131"/> 252   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. ony; not as an improper, but as a ludicrously inap- propriate, injunction. "We know," said the Gov- ernor and Council, " of no excess in apparel, except in the price of it; and had not the direction come from the Company, we should have thought it a flout for our poverty and nakedness." In one thing, at least, the Company discovered their Christian common sense, in a little homily borrowed from a sermon which was preached sixteen hundred and twenty years before, but is to this day disre- garded. In urging upon the colonists the- conversion of the natives to Christianity, they observed that i the example given by the English in their own persons and families would be of singular and chief moment." Elementary, and even classical education, were also recommended; and - quite as urgently - the culture of corn, the making of walnut-oil, wine, and silk, for the two latter of which the Company had made spe- cial and generous provision. Tobacco they discour- aged; commanding to restrict its cultivation to one hundred pounds per head, and declaring that, for dues to them, they would receive " not one Whit in Smoke and Tobacco, but only in useful Commodities.'" But the most important document brought by Sir Francis Wyatt was A Charter of Government. Un- der this instrument:, the powers of legislation were committed to the colonists through their represent- atives, in connection with the Governor and Council; hereby establishing, on a legal basis, the same form of free government of which Sir George Yeardley, without legal sanction, had given a pattern the year before. The Governor, Council, and Represent- atives constituted THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. The   THE CONSTITUTION.          253 Governor had a negative vote.     No law  passed by them  was valid, however, until ratified by the Com- pany  in England;   and  no commandment of the Company in England could have the force of law, until approved and adopted by the General Assembly in Virginia.'   The Assembly were simply required "to follow the Laws, Customs, an d Manner of Trial, and other Administration of Justice used in the Realm of England, as near as may be." Virginia had a WRITTEN    CONS]ITUTION!   She re- ceived it under the reign    of a despot!   No  man, ever more hated   constitutional rights, no man ever frowned more savagely upon popular liberty, than James.  ' Kingcraft," as he called it., was his voca- tion, if he had any.  In his own conceit, he was born for it, inspired with it, a master of it.  Such was his daily boast.  Yet he so ,handled his tools, that he was unwittingly shaping a   Commonwealth.     "The en- croachments of the prerogative, the avowed princi- ples of arbitrary power, began to raise the spirit of ' "We, the Treasurer, Council, and Compsny, by authority directed to us by his Majesty under the Great Seal, ..... do hereby order .... that henceforth there shall be Two SUPREnME COUNCILS......

Liberty in the nation,"-a spirit nowhere more active,  perhaps, than in the Quarter Sessions of the London Company. The Solomon of England withstood and goaded it in the Parliament; so it wrought the more efficiently in the Corporation, where it breathed the breath of life, whence it received its first form, its first habitation, and its first written gospel of great joy. The sacred fire which the king stifled, they nour- ishedl; and while as yet they could build for it no altar at home, they generously transmitted it, by their charter, to the colony which they had fostered abroad. Like the symbolic woman in the Apocalypse, the Genius of Liberty --clothed with' the sun, having the moon under her feet, and a crown of stars on her head- travailed in birth, and pained to be delivered. James, like the dragon of the vision, stood before her, to devour her child as soon as it should be born. But it was caught up, as a holy thing, under Divine pro- tection. And the woman fled, where she had a place prepared for her of God, into the wilderness, - which helped her and the remnant of her seed. There was no Star-Chamber in Virginia. They werehappy auspices under which Sir Francis Wyatt commenced his administration on the 18th of November, when he immediately convened the Gen- eral Assembly under the new Constitution. At this session, a system was established for the administra- tion of justice, -the Governor and Council consti- tuting a Supreme Court, and inferior courts being appointed in the different settlements for the trial of lesser cases, called County Courts, although the coun- try was not yet laid off into counties. Y   OPECHANCANOUGII.      255 At the time of his daughter's departure for Eng- land, Powhattan had removed his residence to the banks of the Potomac. Wearying of care as age advanced, and grieving for the death of his beloved Pocahontas, he gave himself up to the pastime of visiting the different chiefs and tribes under his sway, and left the charge of his government chiefly in the hands of Opechancanough. This fact, added to his personal popularity and his known pre-eminence in point of' talent over Itopatin, the next heir to the government, caused the king of Pamunkey to be re- garded as the rising sun; and, as such, he received the deference both of Indians and English. In addi- tion to this, by a, cunning artifice he had induced the powerful and independent tribe of the Chickahominies to elect him their king in the same year, 1.616,- an event which largely increased his consideration and influence. Powhattan, having maintained con- tinual peace with the English from: the time of Poca- hontas's marriage, had died in April, 1618. Itopatin had succeeded to his title and office; but Opechan- canough, to his influence and real government. Both immediately made a formal league of friendship with the English, which they had maintained, in appear- ance at least, until the arrival of Sir Francis Wyatt. This gentleman, soon after his installation in office, sent Mr. George Thorpe to the royal brothers on a friendly embassy, and to renew and confirm former leagues. They both gave fair and courteous re- sponses; but Opechancanough's deportment was particularly gratifying. He began to talk about the English God, and seemed to Mr. Thorpe to have "more motions of religion" than could be expected    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6802-00000133"/> 256   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. of one so benighted. Paganismn," he said, " did not satisfy him. He wanted to find the God of Captain Smith. - O that he might receive instruction! How gladly would he listen! Could not some way be devised to break the darkness of his poor heathen soul? Suppose that Mr. Thorpe should arrange that some English families should come to reside among liis people, and that some of his people should go to reside with the English. Thus he and others who now knew no other god than Okee -- and he did not seem to be much of a god --might come to under- stand about the English God, and thus they should&amp; be all one people. Would not Mr. Thorpe try to do so much for the poor Indians?"Certainly Mr. Thorpe would"; and the good man, much affected, returned from his mission elated by these ilnications of an opening door for the Gospel. Mr. Thorpe had been one of King James's Gentle- men of the Bed-chamber, was now one of the Gov- ernor's Council, and the Superintendent of the Col- lege lands. He was truly apostolic in his desire and self-denial for the conversion of the Indians.' For their good, he had consented to leave his native land to manage the affairs of the College, their College he considered it,--and was now laboring and pray- ing for the conversion of the chief and his subjects. Toward all these he was so tender in his feelings, and so disinterestedly anxious to conciliate them, that he could not bear to deny them any wish, or that they should be subject to any annoyance. Amiable and gentle as he was, he could exercise severity; but only upon those who wronged or insulted an Indian.-- The land assigned ,to the College consisted of ten   OPECHANCANOUGH.      257 thousand acres, laid off at Henrico, on which were located about a hundred planters, who, were tenants. Half the profits of their labor was to be their own. From the other half, "the fabricke ' was to be built in which " wilde young infidels" were to be trained for wholesome life and heaven. For the personal support of the Superintendent, three hundred acres were assigned, on which were placecden tenants. Mr. Thorpe was hard at work in arranging and managing the affairs of this important enterprise. There was a more of the secular than of the spiritual, however, in. his vocation at present. Houses were to be built, and lands to be allotted, broken up, and planted. Upon this preliminary drudgery he entered body and soul, as the necessary means to a good and glorious end. He could never divest himself of the impres- sions made upon his mind, and the hopes enkindled, by "the motions of religion " in Opechancanough; and, as the chief's residence was at; no great distance from the College manor, he determined to visit him. He did so. He was cordially welcomed, treated with the highest consideration, and listened to, when upon religious topics, with earnest attention. All this was hopeful in Mr. Thorpe's view, and lie thanked God as he was returning to his home. "What a sorry hut!" he soliloquized; "what a sorry hut for a king to live in! Suppose, now, I build him a nice, comfortable English house. Would it not win his confidence to a religion which leads its followers to do kindness even to unbelieving Indians? Then he will listen to my instructions even more teachably. Then, when he learns something more of the Bible, the Lord may unseal his eyes and open his 22 $ I    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6802-00000134"/> 258   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. heart. Then the other chiefs, and all the tribes, when they see the great king believing in the true God and Christ, will begin to learn. And then - and then -" Thus he went on until he sate the desert blossoming as the rose, and the weaned child with his hand on the cockatrice's den. As the result of Mr. Thorpe's meditations, a house was built for Opechancanough; and the two soon met there. The chief always had a smile and a welcome for his good English friend; but at this meeting he was particularly elated, and evinced both his gratitude and respect in every possi- ble way. His delight was unbounded, as he rambled with his visitor through the different apartments, and asked the purpose of this and of that, and wondered how each could have been constructed; but by the lock upon the door he was fascinated. He seemed perfectly contented, the wonderful lock with its key on the one side, and Mr. Thorpe with his Gospel on the other. Now he would turn the key, and now hear the words of grace. The lay missionary was somewhat puzzled by the vacillation of the savage mind between objects so dissimilar; but though the royal pupil w0uld sit and play lock and key a hundred times a day, yet he was so pleased with the company and discourse of his teacher, he asked so many ques- tions about Christianity, and looked so earnestly when he spoke or listened about it, that Mr. Thorpe could not but strike the balance of probabilities against the mystery of the lock, and in favor of the mystery of the Gospel. It was so evident that he had won the chief's ear and heart! and how cheaply too! only by a little painstaking, a little kindness, and a little English cot- tage with a lock and key! O how grateful he was   JACK-OF-THE-FEATHER.     259 for such free and easy access to the mind of this pagan king! He wished for only one thing more, - to lead him within the spiritual fold. How tearfully he prayed for him in secret places! and howu often, in the pres- ence of his pupil, did he mentally exclaim, "How can I give thee up!" Their interviews were repeated; and their conver- sations upon religious matters were long and frequent. Opechancanough could not be far from the kingdom of Heaven; and as for the peaceful behavior of the catechumen and his subjects towards the English, there was now in Mr. Thorpe's mind no shadow of apprehension. His confidence in their good-will never wavered to the moment of his death. The remark- able fruits of Opechancanough's " motions of religion" soon appeared. On the fertile bank of a small creek between James and York rivers lay a fair farm belong- 622 ing to a thrifty farmer by the name of Morgan. But Morgan's thrift was not all the result of his labor on the soil. He had a gift at traffic also, and had been known to drive many a good bargain, when his pres- ence was not needed upon his plantation, by exchang- ing English trinkets for Indian corn and peltry. He always had on hand more or less of those articles which pleased the natives; but in March of 1622 he had still a large supply, although he had been driv- ing a brisk trade during the winter. Quite early in the month, and betimes in the morn- ing, too, Morgan sat regaling himself with a pipe of tobacco of his own raising. There was a stout Indian with him doing likewise, whom Morgan had furnished    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6802-00000135"/> 260   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. with a lodging through the night, and with whom he had just finished a hearty morning meal. Smoking with a companion is a mystery which none but the initiated corprehend. It includes good-fellowship, and even a semi-mesmeric sympathy or interchange of thoughts; in other words, conversation without the trouble of speaking or hearing. As such, our planter- and Indian enjoyed it, without a passing thought of their difference in color, blood, or education. While the pipes lasted, they were brother-spirits, - nothing else.      &amp; This was no common Indian, and, as the sequel will show, he had no little to do with the development of Opechancanough's " motions of religion." He was a noted warrior, known among his people by the name of Nemattanow, a man of great bravery, and considered by the Indians one of their chief war-cap- tains. He had been engaged in many bloody con- flicts with the English before the marriage of Poca- hontas, and, though he had always freely exposed his person, had never received the slightest injury. He was exceedingly ambitious, and had adroitly taken advantage of his many escapes to work upon the su- perstitions of his countrymen, until they believed, what he vauntingly maintained, that he was both in- vulnerable and immortal, - in other words, something more than human. Consequently he was regarded with extreme veneration by all the associated tribes. His great popularity was very annoying to Opechan- canough, who looked upon him as a rival. He was a shrewd fellow, and knew well that any eccentricity of his would essentially increase the awe with which he. was regarded. For this purpose, as well as to gratify #    JACK-OF-THE-FEATHER.        261 his own vanity, he made himself as noted for his cos- tume as for his invulnerability.  He was never seen bat in an extravagant dress, and one wNhich to the eye of an Indian was very grand.   His hair was worn in the usual Indian style, so trimmed as to stand perpen- dicularly, about two inches in height, from the centre of the forehead over the crown to the nape of the neck,-a stiff ridge, "like a cock's comb," say the old writers; the hair on either side being drawn down flat upon the scalp, and knotted behind the ears. But Nemattanow   was peculiar for his display of finery. At each ear hung a beautiful spiral sea-shell, to which were strung three or four pearls.   Upon his broad breast was suspended, by a string of Wampum Peak,* a round tablet of about four inches in diameter, and of the highest polish, having the figure of a new moon and a few mystic characters skilfully etched upon the surface. His neck, wrists, and ankiles were also orna- mented with chains of Peak; while a few dull rings of English manufacture were sported, on his fingers. A sort of half-petticoat hung from   his waist down- ward to the middle of his thigh.    It was made of nicely dressed deer-skin, slashed to a fringe around the lower edge, as around the upper, which fell over and  concealed  the girdle, while  fanciful devices wrought with Peak adorned the surface.     His feet * Peak was of two kinds, both made of the conch-shell. The one, of a dark-purple color, and the most valued, was the Wampum Peak; the other, made of the white part of the shell, was called White Peak. "Ro- anoke " was of far less value, and was made from the cockle-shell. All these were fragments each one third of an inch long and one fourth of an inch in diameter, wrought in cylindrical form, smooth and polished, and strung by a hole drilled through the centre lengthwise. Peak and Roanoke were Indian currency as well as ornaments.

He wore also leggins of the same material, gartered below the knee, and tasselled. In winter he added a wrapper or mantle, called a match-coat, made of a skin or skins with the fur on and inwards; and when in full dress, his head was surmounted with a sort of coronet made of Peak and beads nicely woven, and of delicate colors. He carried his bow in his hand, and from his quiver, which was slung behind, hung the tail of a panther, sweeping the ground at his heels. But the warrior was most remarkable for the manner in which he tricked out his person with feathers. Wherever he could fasten them to please his taste, he did so, a long feather of the eagle, or the hawk, or the wild turkey, or the gay, glittering feather of the sea-drake, upon hs head, his apron, his bracelets, his garters, his anklets. An origi- . nal fantastic was Jack-of-the-Featiher, as the English called him. As there is an end to all things, there was an end to the silent conversation of Morgan and Jack. The pipes were exhausted, the ashes knocked out; the placid illusion was over; and once more the planter was a white man, the guest an Indian. Jack,. with a grunt of ineffable satisfaction, quietly laid his pipe upon a rude bracket at hand, adjusted to his better pleasing some of his ornaments, and broke silence: "Has my white brother mnade great trade since the corn-moon?? "No, no, Jack!" said the planter, in a desponding tone: " your people are too cunning at trade for such a simple man as I. They buy little; they pay little   JACK-OF-THE-FEATHER.    263 when they do buy.  Poor trade, Jack; very poor trade! I think I must give it up." And Morgan sighed heavily. (' Then you have not gone to the right place. The white man should carry to those whoa want what he /has to sell, and who have plenty of what he wants." "Nobody wants, and nobody has plenty," replied Morgan, as though he had never found a customer. "My white brother does not speak truly: many want; many have plenty." '"Who? where?" asked his host sharply. "I can't find them." "Jack-of-the-Feather knows." Nemattanow fancied his English name, when in a familiar mood. "Well, then, who? where? Master Jacl-of-the- Feather?" "I can tell, if Master Morgan has things to sell." "If I have them! I tell you, Jack, I can't sell them, your people are so poor, and so hard upon me. You don't suppose I throw them away, do you?" 4' Perhaps so." "'S blood, man! do you think I 'm a fool? Look here!" And Morgan threw open a chest containing a variety of glittering bawhles, which made the In- dian's heart dance. "A wise mnan," he said, in reply to Morgan's ques- tion,-"la wise man will hunt by the trail. The panther snuffs the scent on the wind."     ^ ; Well, Jack, I 'm neither a wise man nor a fool, nor a hunter, nor a panther; but I should like to sell my goods." ' Then let my white brother go with me."    <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6802-00000137"/> 264   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Where?" "To Panlunkey. They have much skins; no jew- els, no English beads, no bells, -no anything but corn and skins." "Do they want to buy? Much." "Will they?" "They will." ( What makes. you think so? ' '( They say it." "When?" "Yesterday. They did say, 'Tell Master Morgan come to us, for we have no presents for our women. Our wives are getting cross, and our young women do not look pleasant at our young men.'" "Will you guide me through the woods?"' "It will make the Pamunkeys happy. It will make my white brother happy. Why should I not show him the way, then? ' "Then I will go." The planter quickly gathered up his " truck," gave a few orders to two .stout young men, his servants, slung his compact budget upon his arm, and left, attended by Jack. Before night, the Indian had pos- sessed himself of the planter's treasures; the carrion- bird was scenting on the wing the odor of death, and down below her there in the forest lay the corpse of poor Morgan stark and stiff. Not more than two or three days after, Jack made his appearance again upon the plantation, and alone. "Where is master?" inquired one of the servants. "At Pamunkey," answered Jack, promptly. "He get much skins.'"   JACK-O F-THE-EATHER.     265 Why did he not come with you?" "He stay get much skins more. Jack could not stay." "4 What do you wear that cap for?" It was Morgan's cap, stuck full of feathers. 4 The white man love Jack much, and give." "Well, master's friend must come in, and get bread and smoke pipe." "And fire-water too?" "Yes, fire-water too." Jack was soon seated in the house, and James left him, saying that he would get fire-water. He soon returned with Thomas, - they were the only per- sons upon the plantation,-and, marching straight up to the Indian, le laid his hand upon his shoulder. Looking him full in the eye, he said sternly: Jack, you lie! Where is master?" "He die." The servants looked significantly at each other, and Thomas now stationed himself also at JSack's side, and grasped his arm. Their suspicions of foul play had been very strong, but were greatly confirmed by the Indian's avowal of Morgan's death. Jack, without seeming in the least disconcerted, coolly told them to let him alone. But the young men were sturdy, reso- lute fellows, and were now not a little excited. James replied boldly: "No, you red rascal! we shall not let you alone. Perhaps you 've murdered master, who  knows?  You must 'go to Mr. Thorpe." "Jack-of-the-Feather will go on his own path. You 'ake off hands." And the warrior looked sternly in their faces. 23             t    <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6802-00000138"/> 266   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. "No," said Thomas, "you must go and tell Mr, Thorpe where Master Morgan is." The Indian rose slowly to his feet.   "You bring Mr. Thorpe to me"; and with one swing of his powerful arm he hurled the servant across the room. James, however, threw himself resolutely upon Jack; and Thomas regaining his feet, there was a desperate struggle. No blows passed; the young men only trying to pinion the Indian, and lie only to free himself. After a. little rolling about, and some tumbles, the muscular sav- age succeeded in releasing himself, and stood proudly at bay. "Little, children should not try to wrestle with the warrior-chief," he said coolly but scornfully. "They might get hurt. It would make their mothers much cry."  The young men were somewhat confused at their discomfiture, but undaunted and determined. Jacl's sneer did not soothe them. "You shall go to Mr. Thorpe," said Thomas. "  Ugh! English pismire speak big words"; and the chief began to arrange his finery, which had been put sadly out of place by the scuffle. "Tom!" said James, ' this will never do. ie must not get away."  "Cripple him," replied Thomas, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder; and James disappeared. "One gone," said the savage. "He is wise." But a moment more, and James reappeared with a musket "Now, Jack!" said he resolutely, " will you go to Mr. Thorpe as you are, or will you be shot and go?" v             . &amp; J   JACK-OF-THE-FEATHEIR.    267 The Indian's bold look was a little changed at the sight of the weapon ; but he haughtily replied: "Lis- ten, little boy! This is Nemattanow, the great war- rior. Many English guns make shoot at him, but where are their' marks upon his skin? Not one. Boy! save your powder." Jack had lied so long and so many times about his charmed life, that; he half believed in it himself, and stood his ground. "Shoot him, Jim!" exclaimed Thomas, in a pas- sion. "Once more," said James, presenting the piece; "will you go to Mr. Thorpe?" "Nemattanow is a good friend in his lodge; in battle, a warrior. Children! tell MSr. Thorpe he can find Nemattanow in either place '"; and the chief turned deliberately to the door. "s Give me the gun, Jim!" and his comrade caught it from his hands. Nemattanow had strode but a few paces upon the greensward.. The musket was discharged. The chief, with a jerk, threw himself a little more erect, placed his hand upon his side, stopped, turned his face to his pursuers, tottered a moment,. and fell. The young men found him alive.  Without a word, they raised him to a sitting posture, and soon succeeded in stopping the flow of blood, the Indian yielding himself passively and sullenly to their man- agement. He now revived sufficiently to support himself; upon which the young men began to con- sider what they should do. "Going to Mr. Thorpe can't be done now, Jim. The fellow cannot walk a mile."    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6802-00000139"/> 268   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. James studied for a moment the pallid face and short breathing of the wounded man, and shook his head. "No, Tom, it can't be done. Slip him into the boat, and take him down to Sir Francisb I'm glad he's so near, for the sooner he knows the truth about this business the better. There may be a fuss made about it." "You 're right, Jim, if we can get him to the boat. Jack! can you walk, poor fellow, if we help you?" The Indian slowly raised his head, which had drooped upon his breast, and looked toward the lads. The natural fire of his eye was evidently flagging, but it was yet there. The lid was heavy, and the eye itself wavered, as if feeling after some object upon which to fix itself; but he made no answer. "Jack!" said Thomas, dropping upon his knees, and drawing the sufferer's shoulder gently upon his own for support; "Jack! do you hear? Can you get to the creek if we help you? We must take you. to the Governor. It will be all the way in the boat, you know."  The poor man only groaned. "Can't you speak?" continued Thomas, taking the Indian's hand kindly in his own. Jack slightly pressed that of the man who had shot him; but there was a gentleness, a woman-like meaning in the pres- sure, feeble as, it was, which said more impressively than words, "' There is no enmity between me and thee." Thomas felt its meaning, and was amazed. "What's come over the man,?"' said he, looking at his companion. "He feels my hand just as if I was   JACK-OF-THE-FEATHER.     269 his brother! Queer for a proud savage heathen, an't. it?" "We can't stop to talk about his feel, Tom. Can we get him to the boat? ' The speaker's voice now arrested the roving mo- tion of the Indian's eye, which became fixed upon James's face with a wistful expression not to be mistaken. "He wants something," said James. ; What is it, Jack? Would you like to go?" With a strong effort, the Indian managed to say, "Water!" "Get him some water, quick, Jim, while I hold him."' The poor man drank eagerly and largely, and soon revived enough to signify his assent to the plan of his captors. They therefore supported him to the boat, which was near, made an extempore mattress in it, on which they laid him with all possible gentleness, and 'in less than an hour had glided to the mouth of the creek, and were 'floating on the broad current of the James. Nemattanow had lain all this while with his eyes closed, and giving no sign of suffering but an occasional groan, or a faint call for water. Nei- ther had the two servants broken silence, except now and then by monosyllables. Once in the channel of the river, they hoped soon to be where Sir Francis Wyatt then was, the whole distance being only about seven or eight miles from their plantation. But the Indian now began to be, very restless, and was evi- dently in great distress. ' Tllat can I do for you, Jack?" said Thomas, whose compassion was much excited, even to tears. 23*    <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6802-00000140"/> 270   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Thank!" said Nemattanow, in a husky voice. "One thing. Two thing. Then I die." " no, werowance!" said James; " we shall soon be there. We shall get you a medicine-man then, and you will be better." ' No, no!" said Nemattanow, with some energy; for although his distress was evidently increasing, either his strength or his resolution seemed' to be in- creasing also. No, no! he repeated, raising him- self upon his elbow, '"I die. You do for Jack one thing? You do tao?" "Yes, Jack; one thing, or two' things, or any- thing we can," said Thomas, most earnestly. "Hold, Tom!" interposed James. "Let us know first what you want, Jack?" i"When I die, do notl send me to my people. Put me in the ground with the English. You do this?" "Yes, yes " exclaimled Thomas, impulsively. '( No, Jack; we cannot promise yet," said Jaines. "We will not do any such thing for you, unless you will do for us.,' "Do! What can Jack-of-thle-Feather do now?" ; You muslt tell us about master." "'What?"  "I-ow he died, and where he is."' "And then you do for me?"  * Ye's." '; Two thng?" "What is the other? ' "Do not let my people know that the English gun shoot me. Do not let them know I die." "Why not'? ' The dying chief sat up erect. Death was stamped   JACK-OF-THE-FEATHER.     271 upon his features, but he was shruggling with it hard. The spirit of the warrior was with:in him proud and strong. His eye glowed, he stretched out his brawny arm with a most impressive and even majestic air, and answered: "Nemattanow great warrior.  His people say he is a god; that nothing hurt him; that he cannot die. Let them say it. Let them think it when the great warrior is dead. Tell them I go to the hunting-grounds of the brave, but not tell I die. Say I go up oln the mountain-top; the Great Spirit send cloud very bright, and take ].emattanonw up. So they'will be proud of their great chief; and Ne- mattanow will be happy. You do t;wo thing?" "If you tell the truth about Master Morgan." "Then you do for me?" -f Yes!" "Yes!" responded both.. ' I kill." ' You killed him?" "Yes, I kill." In answer to their inquiries where the' corpse of their master might be found, the chief told as well as it could be done; but the information led to no dis- covery. Of his motives for the murder, and of its particulars, he would say nothing.. Solemnly re- minding the young men that by his confession they were pledged to fulfil his wishes, he signified that  conversation was at an end. "Now," said he, " let the warrior die. Nematta- now will go to his fathers." He held out his hands, one to each of his captors; grasped theirs in a mute but cordial :farewell, and fell back upon his couch. After two or three minutes he rose again, and began a wild chant in his native    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6802-00000141"/> 272,  THE YOUTH- OF THE OLD DOMNION. tongue. There were signs of bodily anguish which he could not suppress; but his face was radiant with pride and exultation, and every note of his song was clear, nervous, triumphant. The young men knew a little of the Indian tongue; enough to perceive that he was recounting his exploits on the war-path, and bidding the spirits of the dead to receive a mighty warrior with honor. Thus died Nemattanow; ingloriously, but full of pride; a heathen, but firm and exultant in the hope of immortality; ignorant of the true God, but stead- fast and consistent to the last in the only faith and the only. virtues which he knew. The historian sneers at his passion for posthumous admiration, yet cherishes the same folly, and calls himself a- Christian! The Pharisee scorns the pagan's fidelity to a dreed .so meagre, yet does no honor to his own by obedience. The puling spiritualist shudders at the bold .and boastful transit of an Indian warrior, yet is there a great gulf between his own life and the sim- plest precepts of Christ. Each is a nystery to all but God; and a living caricature of the Gospel, however demure, may rtt exalt himiself over the dying devotee of a sensuous faith. Each is a mystery to all but God; and so is the dying hour of each, with its oper- ations and its issues.'   Smith, 144. Stith, 208 209.   CHAPTER    XVII. THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT. THAE report of this double tragedy had hardly 1622. been made to Sir Francis Wyatt, when it was represented to him that Opechancanough was loud in his threats to revenge the death of Nemattanow. Prudence dictated that the rumror should be promptly, noticed. Accordingly the Governor despatched a mes- senger charged to impress upon the chief the injustice and the very bad policy of any hostile demonstra- tions. The message was delivered about the middle of March. Opechancanough was plainly told what rumors had reached the Governor's ears; that Ne- mattanow, although killed in a scuftle, had suffered justly as the murderer of an English subject; and that any attempt at retaliation on the part of the Indians would be terribly punished. The chief received the messenger with the utmost respect and friendliness. ' He was very much sur-- prised, he was grieved, that his peaceful disposition should be called' in question! What was the death of Nemattanow to him but a matter of collgratula- tion? The fellow had always been a thorn in his side. Had not Opechancanough told Sir George Yeardley that he would thank him if he would have Nemattanow's throat cut? Let Sir Francis ask Sir George. 'What did Opechancanough desire more    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6802-00000142"/> 274   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. than to see his people and the English living together like neighbors, like brothers? He had been arranging with Mr. Thorpe for this very sort of intercourse, and now should he break it up? Let the Governor ask Mr. Thorpe about hiMs heart toward the English. Mr. Thorpe knew all about it, for he was teaching him the good religion. Had( he not already made a treaty of peace, in which he had even consented that the English should freely occupy any lands under his con- trol not already tilled or built upon by the Indians? Was not that friendship? ,To show his sincerity and the perpetuity of that treaty, had it not been already engraved-upon brass, and fixed upon the most vener- able oak in his forests, that it might be had in ever- lasting remembrance? and had not this been done at the request of Opechancanough himself? What more could Sir Francis expect? No! the sky would fall before lie should break peace!,' Such eneirgetic asseverations on the chief's part, although not alone satisfactory, Were so in their con- nections. Mr. Thorpe, who knew him intimately, had the utmost confidence in his pacific disposition, and in his " motions of religion." Besides, the chief had sent such a message to Sir George, and of his sinceri- ty in doing so there could be no doubt. Under these circumstances, all apprehension subsided; and the little flurry to which the death of the Indian favorite had given rise, passed away like a morning vapor. All was again tranquil and sunny. All wore the aspect of peace. All rejoiced in a sense of security. The tide of prosperity had now fairly set in upon the colony, which had so long struggled against every conceivable hinrderance and misfortune. During the   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.         275 three preceding years, the number of immigrants had been  large.  Forty-two  ships and  twelve  hundred mariners had been employed in the transportation of three thousand five hundred    and seventy men and women, besides abundance of provisions and cattle; and the entire population amounted to      about four thousand.'   They were enjoying, under their new form of government, greater privileges and thrift than the most sanguine among them had ever ventured to expect.  The people were    scattered Wtherever they could find spots favorable to their several avocations, "and the further from neighbors held the better."   Iron- works, under the charge of Mr. John Berkeley, were in a state of forwardness at Falling Creek, and they were expected soon to be in successful operation. They had planted cotton for the first time the year before, and with such results that they were preparing for a new crop, andr  with sanguine hopes.   Mulberry- * Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, states the population for this year to have been three thousand eight hundred. Other writers indicate it as low as three thousand five hundred. The authority which I have before me is a volume entitled, "A Declaration of the State of the Colo- ny and Affaiies in Virginia, with a Relation of the Barbarous Massacre, in the Time of'Peace and League, treacherously executed by the Native Infidels vpon the English, the 22d of March last." It was "( imprinted" at London in 1622, and "Published by Authoritie." On page 14 it states, in agreement with otier writers, that the number of those who perished was three hundred and forty-seven; and on page 18, that "about eleven parts of twelve of the English were still remayning." This would, make the population previously to have been four thou.. sand one hundred and sixty-four, supposing the proportion of twelve to eleven to have been exact. The number of immigrants which I have given in the text, for the preceding three years, is as given in the same little volume, on page 6. On this"Declaration"I chiefly rely in sketching l;he following narra- tive.     <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6802-00000143"/> 276   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. trees were cultivated in abundance, silk-worms were prospering well, and the people were expecting soon to produce silk, under the superintendence of expe- rienced Frenchmen, who had been brought over for the purpose. French vine-dressers also had been sent out by the Company, and promised soon to manufac- ture wine in large quantities, a sample of which they had already sent to Englanl. Fig-trees, pomegran- ates, potatoes, sugar-cane, hemp, flax, &amp;c., &amp;c. were also under cultivation.  So much were the Company elated by this state of things, that " they voted that a sermon should be preached to testify and express their thankfulness to God for his blessing on their labors and undertaking "; and this was done at the Bow Street Church in Lon- don, on the 17th day of April. In addition to what we have stated, the most friendly and confiding intercourse was maintained be- tween the colonists and the natives. The Indians dis- played no jealousy or ill-will toward the English ;. the English had none toward the Indians. The latter, always of a roving disposition, were to be seen daily moving about the plantations; and to such a degree was this intimacy carried, that there was not a family whose numbers, whose persons, whose crops, whose times and places of labor, whose domestic habits, and whose private apartments even, they did not know. The houses of the planters were always open to the natives. The Indian came when he pleased, and when he pleased returned to his hut in the woods. He brought his burden of venison or wild-fowl, of fish or fruits, to sell; was welcomed to the white man's table, and lodged under his roof, and in the morning   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    2" received a return for his commodities, and went away cheerily for home. In short, the Indians and the Eng- lish ' seemed entirely to have coalesced, and to live together as one people," except that there were no in- termarriages between them, for the English "' excepted against the Indian women on accounl; of their being Pagans, as well as their complexions." Besides all these happy circumstances, there were to be taken into account the strong yearnings of Opechancanough after the Truth. They might soon result in his con- version! The influence of this upon his countrymen who could estimate? In such a state of'things, the planter could go to his field, or the trafficker upon his business, or the mem- ber of the Council to his duty at JarnestownNvithout the encumbrance of sword or firelock:. Arms were  altogether slighted. Guns were out 'of use, except when a planter was in the humor to bring down a deer or a turkey. Indeed, scarcely any weapon was to be found in the dwellings of the English more for- midable than the axe, the spade, or the hoe. On the 21st of March there was a peculiar move- ment of the various tribes under the sway of Ope- chancanough, whose talents and warlike qualities had acquired for him, not only the election of the powerful Chickahominies as their king, but the popular and practical ascendency over the dorinions of Powhat- tan, to whom -Itopatin had nominally succeeded. This movement was universal. It was conducted in silence, and almost wholly under cover of the for- ests. The natives were not only astir, but they were all converging, in detached parties, and with the 24    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6802-00000144"/> 278   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. greatest regularity and concert, towards the various settlements of the whites. The :first parties in motion were from their remote villages; but as these and the day advanced, others and still others from other and nearer villages took up their march. Only those who were within a few hours of the plantations remained quiet during the day. But as the sun went down, new parties were on foot, and still new ones as the night advanced, until, when the day of the 22d dawned, there was not a wigwam in all the extensive tract which had not sent forth its warrior. Yet still the movement progressed, each party with more and yet more caution as they approached yet nearer to the several plantations, treading one behind another, each man in the footprint of his predecessor, and the last' carefully effacing every vestige of their march. Rare- ly did any two parties come in hearing or sight of one another; but when 'they ;did, they exchanged no word, but,' with a silent recognition, pursued their several courses. By sunrise there was not a settlement of the English which they had :not closely surrounded. Then they quietly laid themselves down to rest in the woods, that they might be refreshed for the festivity which they had planned. Never did the most accomplished general plan and carry out with more celerity and precision so compli- cated a movement of so many bodiesof men, and from so many and so distant points. No mistake, no dis- order, occurred. That the English upon this occasion might not lack for good cheer, Opechhancanough had deputed a suffi- cient number to go in advance of their companions, with presents tlo the principal men of the colonists.                          .(   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    279 The evening before, it would seem, he had sent veni- son and fish and wild-fowl to Sir Francis Wyatt at Jamestown, and to some of the members of the Coun- cil, "with expressions of regard and assurances of frienclship." ' This morning, some of the Indians, leaving their fellows in the woods, went to others of the Council,t with like presents and. in great abun- dance, saying that their chief had had good luck in his hunting, and would share it with the white chiefs, his brethren., that they might be merry while he was merry. At the same time others entered the plan- tations, bearing game for sale; while a few, in th6 course of the morning, emerged from the woods in company with white men, whom they had guided carefully to their several homes 'by direction of Ope- chancanough. They were all franlly welcomed by the English, who gladly bought or accepted what they brought, and 'cheerfully loaned to them their boats as they would cross to or fro upon the river. Opechancanough must have had a great hunt, and a very brotherly heart toward the English, for there was not a single plantation where' were not Indians bear- ing burdens of wild-fowl and deer. It seldom, if ever, had happened that so many visited the settle- ments at once; and never had they been more cour- teous and friendly in their deportment. "Welcome, Tettatnow!' exclaimed Mr. Thorpe, as an Indian appeared at his door. "The white chief has a good heart" replied Tettat- now; " he always welcome for Indian." * Burk, I. 240; Beverley, 39; Smith, 144. t Bark, I. 239; Keith, 138.    <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6802-00000145"/> 280   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. "And why not? 'We have the same Father above. Are we not brothers, then, Tettatnow?" "We are brothers," the Indian responded, as he seated himself in a chair which his host presented. "Tettatnow bring his brother much present from Ope- chancanough." And he pointed through the open door to two Indians who had followed him, laden with the spoils of the forest. "Opechancanough is very kind to his white broth- er," replied Mr. Thorpe, and the good man's face beamed with pleasure. The present was valuable, but not half so much so for its own sake as'for its evidence of Opechancanough's esteem and affection. "He think much what Mr. Thorpe say about God of the English; and when the God of the English send him good hunt, he say, 'Because Mr.' Thorpe pray him.' So he send some for thank." Mr. Thorpe smiled at the Indian's simplicity; at the same time inwardly praying, with thanksgiving, that light might be vouchsafed to his royal pupil. Tettatnow was a warrior of some repute among his people, and a confidential assistant of Opechanca- nough. Mr. Thorpe had met him at the dwelling of the chief; and had often entertained him, both by day and bynight, at his own. Tettatnow had heard many words of Christian instruction from his lips; and the two were on a footing of as much ease and familiarity as could ever exist in those days between a white man of station, and a dignified, courtier-like Indian. The sun had but just risen when the latter made his appearance; andMr. Thorpe had been sitting alone at his table in a little room which served him as a study and a place of business, enjoying at the same   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.   281 time the goodness of God in the fresh air of the morn- ing and in the promises of the Word. He now closed his Bible, and went with Tettatnow to receive the present of the chief. After delivering it to the care of one of his servants, and after a little desultory conversation, Mr. Thorpe said: "Tettatnow, you know that we always pray to our God in the morning. It is now Our time. Will you and your men come with us while we pray?" "We will come. But why do you. pray to your God? Is he not good?" "To be sure! He is all goodness. We pray be- cause he is good." "Not like Indian, then. Indian's God good too. Because he is good, we not pray." "Not pray because he is good! I do not under- stand, Tettatnow. Besides, I have been told you do pray. Opechancanough prays to the Indian's God." "No, no, Mr. Thorpe. Our God is up above the sky. He so great, no man understand him. He so happy, he cannot be happier. He so lind, he not be kinder for pray, for nothing else. Look, Mr. Thorpe  is not the ground covered with dew? Look more, Mr. Thorpe! will not the grass growT and the flower open because they are washed with the dew  and warmed? From where come the warm.? From the sun. From where come the dews? From the morn- ing's womb. Do you pray the morning to send the dews? Do you pray the sun to send warm?  No, no, Mr. Thorpe! Why no? Because the sun so full he run over, and send warm without pray, of himself; and the morning so full she spill out the dews with- out pray, of herself. So Indian's God.

He so full, he cannot help it,-just like the sky, just like the sun. So we no pray him." "But you do pray, Tettatnow." - Not to Great Spirit. He so full of good, it come down without pray. He so great, he not stop to hear so little words of little small Indian. He just open his big stream of good all the time. It flow along, and flow along everywhere; for Mr. Thorpe, for Ope- chancanough, for Tettatnow, for all. Let each one drink. What for I pray the stream flow, when it flow all the time, and all around? No, Mr. Thorpe, we not pray the Great Spirit: we pray the bad spirit, Okee." The bad spirit! the Devil! Good God! for hat?' exclaimed Mr. Thorpe, in amazement. v "If we not pray him, he angry, and spoil the good things the Great Spirit sends. He give thunder and storm, and war and sick, and no food. We pray him, then he keep back thunder and storm and other bads, and let us have the food and health and peace which come along on the great river of God. That the way Indian pray. But Tettatnow will pray Eng- lish God with Mr. Thorpe. He much good Spirit too. But he like pray; so Tettatnow will pray him.' ": Mr. Thorpe, somewhat perplexed, mused a few mo- mentis in silence, and then said: "Well, Tettatnow, we will pray to the English God now. It is our time. Afterwa:rds we will eat, and then we will talk' more." "It is good," said Tettatnow. * Bcverly, 170. (,   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    283 The Indians were uniformly very unwilling to com- municate their notions of religion. Hence the words of Tettatnow were strange to Mr. Thorpe, notwith- standing his previous intimacy with the natives, and the many discourses which he had had with them upon religious matters. But his visitor was in a pe- culiarly communicative mood, and, as the sequel will show, cared not what knowledge his white fiiend might acquire, his only object being to gain the con- fidence and friendly interest of Mr. Thorpe by throw- ipg off all reserve. At a word from Mr. Thorpe, a long blast from a conch-shell was given, the signal for, morning prayer; and in a few minutes all the servants of the farm and all the inmates of the house were ranged in the com- mon halll. The three Indians likewise, half clad in their wild costume of skins and trinkets, sat gravely in the places assigned to them. After reading from the Sacred Scriptures and singing a hymn of praise, the family rose to kneel in prayer. 'This simultaneous movement startled the two stranger Indians. A look of mingled alarm and defiance crossed their features, and they half sprang to, their feet; but the composed attitude of Tettatnow, to whom the service was not new, and an almost imperceptible sign of rebuke from his eye, reassured them, and the incident passed al- most unnoticed. The Indians'sat perfectly quiet and respectful while Mr. Thorpe read the prayer for the day. But the good man's heart could not be con- fined to the form of words. The wild sons of the forest were in his presence, the heathen were there by the very steps of the altar,--how could he refrain from special petitions in their behalf'? Earnestly did k. I,      <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6802-00000147"/> 284   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. he plead for them and for their brethren, that they might be brought to the knowledge of the Truth, that English and Indian might have one fold and one Shepherd. This was a usual burden of' his prayers; but this morning he seemed earnest and importunate as the Patriarch when he interceded for the cities of the plain. The family now dispersed to make preparations for their morning meal, and Mr. Thorpe, with his three guests, stepped out to loiter upon the green- sward. An English mrastiff welcomed his master with signs of affection; but, setting his eyes savagely upon the Indians, gave a low, sullen growl, indicative of dislike and jealousy. They shrank back errified, for the natives direaded these strange and powerful animals even more than the English fire-arms. Mr. Thorpe, bidding his guests by no means to retreat, lest they should provoke an attack from the dog, im- mediately laid hands upon him, and called angrily for one of his servants. How many times, Thomas, must I repeat my orders that this dog shall not be permitted to frighten the Indians? Take, him and chain him; and if you are not more careful' I certainly shall have him killed too." Mr. Thorpe had already caused several mastiffs to be killed, and to the great grief of their owners, for no other reason than that they were objects of terror to the Indians.  I will chain him, sir," replied the man, sulkily, "because I must; but if I could --" "If you could what, sirrah?" "If I could have my say, I would say that some dogs know more nor some men.": *,   . r. . '  . *       THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    285 "Thomas!" said Mr. Thorpe, with some stern- ness, "if I did not know you as well as I do, I should think you were insolent. What do you mean?" "God forbid, Measter Thorpe!" replied the man, humbly. "I only mean that dumb brutes some- times see danger where men do noti. They seem to have some kind o' senses that we ha' n't to make up for their dumbness, like; an' somehow it seems to me that we ought n't to slight; 'em when they bristle up an' growl so. They always means some-. thin', sir."' "You are a silly fellow, Thomas;, if you think; there is anything to be afraid of now. So go and chain up the brute." The man did so; but he growled as much as the dog, declaring, aside, that his master must be half a fool himself, to think there was nothi:ng to be afraid of when there were so many Indian devils about. ' "Buck! yer are a dog o' sense?" said he, patting him with a patronizing air. "Maybe I mought say yer a Christian dog. Yer can't bear the sight nor smell o' a heathen, anyhow. Now, Buck, yer did n't see how the devils looked when master was a prayin', did yer? No, yer did nft, Buck, 'cause yer warn't there. But I did though, 'cause why? 'Cause I was there. An' did n't I peek under my arm? and did n't I see their infernal faces a lookin' as though they'd like to eat us all, the devils; just like the old un what goes round like a lion a roarin'?

Yes, good feller!    <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6802-00000148"/> 286   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Yer knowed jest as well! Atween this an' that, Buck, I think yer 've more sense on this pint nor Measter Thorpe hisself. Them 's my opinions, Buck!"Buck growled assent. ' Tom is right, an't he?" and the man seated himself, throwing his arm lovingly over the dog's neck, patting him, and looking into his clear, intelligent eye. Buck licked Tom's nose. "Now, Buck, tell' me, what 's so many on 'em round for this mornin'? an' what makes 'em so cussed perlite, a smilin' an' a smilin'? Yer remem- ber, old feller, what one of them Drury Lane popin- jays said one night, 'Can smile an' smile, an' be a villain'? Ay, yer do, do ye? An' that makes yer suspicious on 'em, does n',t it? Right, Buck! Yer an' I?s o' the same mind exactly. A smilin', an' a smilin', an' a givin' away venison an9 birds, an' a goin' to prayer, an' a grinnin' like hell, the infernals! Good by, Buck! Keep a sharp look out, an' speak if yer want to." So saying, the man went grumbling into, the house. A bounteous breakfast was served, Tettatnow shar- ing his meal at a table with Air. Thorpe, and the other Indians with the servants. Tettatnow was un- usually talkative and cheerful, and the others were bland and considerate in their demeanor, but not able to converse in English. The meal finished, every man went his way, wherever upon the plantation his services were required. Mrs. Rowles, the housekeeper, composing her babe in its little bed, resumed her do- mestic cares, while Richard, her husband, smiling upon the infant, betook himself to the field. Tettat- now, begging of Mr. Thorpe the loan of a boat, sent   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    287 one of his men across the river, while he and the other sauntered about the premises of Berkeley EHun- dred. Such was the free and easy deportment of the In- dians on this memorable Friday morning, not only on Mr. Thorpe's plantation, about; five miles ' from Charles City, but at all the English settlements to which they had gained access. Mr. Thorpe, after passing an hour or two in the business of his office, went out to inspect the labors of the field, and was immediately joined by Tettat- now and his companion. "I see," said he, "' that many of your people are with us to-day. We are glad to see them." There were at least a dozen Indians then in sigyht. ' So great hunt give our people much glad. They come to make much trade." A pleasant conversation followed, partly upon the English modes of tillage, partly upon matters of re- ligious faith and duty. Tettatnow was all attention, and manifested a very inquiring and teachable dis- position. Thus passed the time until nearly the. hbur of noon, when their conference was interrupted by Thomas, who called his master aside, saying: "Measter Thorpe, I can't be easy a minute, for these Indian devils. I must speak my mind, sir."' "Well, Thomas, speak your mind, if it will make you easy." "I 'n sure there 's mischief a brewin', sir, an' we 'd best take care of ourselves." * So says the "Declaration."

"Thomas! you are very suspicious, and, it seems to me, without any reason. We have always treated the Indians kindly. It is for their interest to behave peaceably, and they cannot wish or dare to do us any harm. Besides, they would fear to offend their chief, who is our firm friend. Look, Thomas! every Indian whom you see is unarmed. They have no bows and arrows, nor any other weapons. Go to your work, man, and give up these foolish fears." "If you 'd a seed what I have, sir, maybe you 'd think different.' ; What have you seen, Thomas?" "I seed them three when you was to prayer, Meas- ter, an' they 'd the strangest look o' their eyes you ever seed." C What look?" "Ugly-, like; klind o' snaky, sir, just as though they 'd jump an' eat every mother's son o' us." "All a fancy of yours, Thomas."' ' I do' know., Measter, I do' know. Sometimes a man's eyes tells tales when he don't mean it, a bein' more honest nor himself.

"Do let them talk together, if they want to; and if you don't like them so near, tell them so. Don't be foolish, man." "An' then, sir, the dog, he keeps a growlin' an' a   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    289 growlin'. An' not half an hour ago, what does he do but he ups an' begins a howlin' an' a howlin' like mad. He smells somtethin' wrong, I nm sure. Them dogs hal got strange foresight sometimes. I w'ish you 'd let me unchain him, sir." No, no, Thomas. If he is so uneasy, he would only frighten, or perhaps bite, these'poor naked In- dians. Let him be, and be easy :yourself, can't. you?  "Then, sir," continued the man, with tears in his eyes, "I beg you to go away into the house. For God's sake, sir, take care of yourself. There s no harm in that." "I 'l1 take care, my good fellow," said Mr.. Thorpe, much affected by the man's emotion; 'but the In- dians are my friends." "' Good God, Measter! I beg you to come away. If you woin't, let me take care of myself.'. ( yes!" replied Mr. Thorpe, laughing ; "only don't forget your dinner, Thomas. It will be ready soon"'; and he returned to his Indian friends, while "s timid servant swiftly disappeared. Tettatnow, upon Mr. Thorpe's return, eagerly pro- pounded a question about the Christ;ian's heaven, which roused all the good man's enthusiasm. "It is a glorious heaven, Tettatnow; full of love, full of happiness. All are good there; no hatred, no sorrow, no doing wrong. We are both great sinners, Tettatnow; but if we love Jesus and serve him here, then he will forgive us, and we shall both go there and see him. And oh! it will be enough only to see Him, - o-ur Redeemer! And then he will smile upon us, and call us his people, and tell us how he * . , m25    <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6802-00000150"/> 290   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. has always loved us. And then our hearts will be so full of joy, that we shall always be singing, ' Glory and honor and -- " When and where and how did' this lay apostle finish his description? Not in this world. A blow from behind, dealt with the whole strength of the stranger Indian, had cleft the good man's skull. At the instant, Tettatnow raised the war-yell. It was echoed on every side. Indians sprang from the woods, armed with bows and arrows and tomahawks. Three or four men fell instantly by the hands of the Indians who were near them, struck down with their own implements of husbandry. Others, taking the alarm, attempted flight. Shrieks came from the house, but only aE momentary effort could the mother malke to save her child. Both were slain, as was the husband and father abroad. Brief cries for help, and dying groans from strong men struck unawares, re- sounded from the field. The straggling Indians in sight, reinforced by those who had lain in ambush, made quick and savage work with their unsuspecting victims. The mastiff yelled with rage, and leaped frantically to the end of his chain. But it was strong, and the faithful creature, before whom every Indian would have fled, expended his efforts in vain. The work of death went on amid the yells of onslaught and of triumph. A single man---it was Rowles, nerved by the thought of his wife and babe --chanced to stand at bay; but unarmed, bewildered, and sur- rounded by half a score of foes, he added but a mo- ment to his life. On the ploughed field, on the grass, in the house, lay eleven corpses weltering in blood, - Mr. Thorpe, eight men, one mother, and her child.                  .   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.     2!91 Whether any escaped, save the man Thomas, does not appear in the records of the transaction. Not ten minutes had passed after Mr. Thorpe fell, when the slaughter was over, and every noise had ceased but the shouts of the butchers and the furious howls of the' mastiff. The slaughter was over, but not the work. Scalps hung dripping at the warrior's belts, or dangling upon poles. Pagan Indians. sported with English blood,-just as baptized English did with Scotch blood, more than a hundred years after, on the field of Culloden.* They mangled and quartered their victims, and tore them piecemeal, and flung their hearts, throbbing with lingering life, upon glow- ing coals, and hung. their heads on high for the car- rion-birds, --all of which was only just as the minions of George the Second did in Christian London, in the seventeen hundred and forty-sixth year of Grace i Not a corpse was cold before it was draggled in frag- ments across the field, or. flung by bits from Indian to Indian, as boys fling snow-balls in winter, or as fools do sugar-plums in Carnival. The body of Mr. Thorpe, their best friend, their unwearied benefactor, fared no better, but was " abused with such spight and scorn as is unfit to be heard or related."' "Not hee hath lost by it," says the chronicler whom we follow, " not hee hath lost by it, who, to the comfort of vs all, hath gayned a Crowne of endless blisse, and is assuredly become a glorious Martyr, in which -thrice-happy and blessed state we leaue him." * "The men [English soldiers] at length began to amuse themselves by splashing and dabbling each other with blood."

The Indians retired to the woods with their trophies, and Berke- ley Hundred, but just before full of lappy life and hardy industry, was left to Death and Silence. Even the dog, exhausted by hs own violence, and horror stricken by the scenes He had witnessed, lay whining, and trembling, and allone. But Berkeley Hundred was not the only field of blood thlat day. Its tragedy was simall compared with what was enacted elsewhere. On no less than thirty other planiations, at the same hour of high noon, the same signal of attack was given by other Indian parties, who had sauntered into thie settle- ments on the same pretences, and with the same innocence of deportment. Their familiarity with the English had long been such, that " they knew exactly at what places and quarters every Englishman was to be found"; and they stationed themselves accord- ingly, those in ambush p)atiently waiting for the sig- nal from their fellows who had dispersed over the plantations. At the same hour of high noon, through- out all those scattered settlements, the same signal, the same work of death; and before that one hour had expired, three hundred and forty-seven English - n some places only two, in others a dozen, twenty, ifty, at Martin's Hundred seventy-three -- had fallen victims, not only killed, but brained, beheaded, dis- *mbowelled, hacked asunder, kicked piecemeal about heir fields, hung i. fragmelns on the limbs of their rees or the posts o f theii doors. Men, w n, and hildren were indiscriminately slaughtered ad indis- rlminately outraged after death. Of these, eighty- even-as nearly as can be determined from the   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    293 lists given - were women and children, and six were meimbers of the Governor's Council. The plot embraced every individual settlement in Virginia; and there were eighty of them, scattered along the James River for an extent of a hund:red, and forty miles, and northward- even as far as the Po- tomac River. But the angel of mercy had interceded, and an invisible line had been drawn, beyond which the destroyers could not pass. In some, few places, the design had been detected just long enough to ad- mit of defensive measures. In such cases, the attack was either wholly prevented or but partially successfil. Such was their conviction of the advanta1ges of Eng- lish weapons; that the least sign of preparation, the least show of resistance, was sufficient so to intimi- date the Indians that they struck feebly or not at all. Nathanael Causie, a veteran soldier who had served under Captain Smith, though dreadfully wounded,. ,managed to brain one of a party who assailed him, upon which the rest fled in consternation, and he escaped. A' Mr. Baldwin, his wounded wife lying for dead at his feet, saved her life, his household, and his house, by a single firelock, although' suirrounded by scores of assailants. Two men who had retreated to a house defended themselves successfully against a party of sixty. On one plantation, the Indians had slaughtered six men, wounded the remaining seventh, and fired the house, when a boy, by one random dis- charge of a gun, frightened them away, and saved the lives of about twenty women and children. Even a defence with only spades, axes, and brickbats was sufficient to make the savages aband on an attack.- But to one incident chiefly were the survivors in.   <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6802-00000152"/> ,-  .- .. . ., uJu I DOMNION. debted for their salvation. There were two Indians, brothers, who were habitually employed to hunt for the English, one of whom was' domesticated in the family of Perry, the other in that of Pace. On the night before the massacre, they lodged together in Pace's house. One of thenm, Twhose name was Chanco, was a Christian convert. During the night, his brother revealed to Chanco the plan of attack for the next day, at the same time telling him that it was his duty as a subject of Opechancanough, by whose command it was to be executed, to talke pait in the tragedy, and ordering him in the chief's name to kill Pace, while he himself should be gone to do the same to Perry. The brother then departed upon his errand. "A summons 6f such tenor was well calculated to prevail with a savage mind; but a new mind had been given to this convert."- Shocked at the atrocity of the order, -for Pace was not only a fellow-man, but lhad ever treated him with parental and Christian kindness, -- he lef't his bed immediately upon his brother's departure, and disclosed the plot to Pace The latter, first fortifying his own house and with all despatch, instantly rowed across the river, nearly three miles, to Jamestow'n, and comlmunicated his startling intelligence to the Governor. Sir Francis took prompt measures to alarm-  . " such other plantations as was possible for a timely intelligence to be given," and as many as received the warning were consequtently on their guard. This was sufficient for their preserva- tion. But for this eleventh-hour discovery, the slaughter would probably have been universal. "For euen,  3ays our chronicler, "in the deliuerie of vs that now ijwjlB tljflrr-^^- Jt;;;;ZI  4 8$n-*--uu?,   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    295 suruiue, no man's particular carefulnesle saued any one person, but the meere goodnesse of God himselfe freely, and miraculously preserued whom it pleased him.

During the four years succeeding the death of Pow.2 hattan, Opechancanough had been devising this at- tack upon the English settlements, preparing the minds of his warriors for it, inflaming his people, and drilling them to the habit of concerted movement necessary to its execution. Having unbounded influ- ence with them as a warrior and a counsellor, he easi- ly imparted his Own implacable and deadly hatred of the foreigners. But' though a man of intrepid courage in his own rude mode of wfafare, he felt his inferiority to the Eiglish in respect to the weapons of war, and would not suffer his burning hatred to get the better of sound discretion. He therefore adopted a policy of profound dissimulation; and so absolutely and perfectly, during all these years, did he repress beneath the same mask the impatient rage of his war- riors, that not a word had slipped, not a hint had been dropped, not an unguarded look had occurred, to fore- shadow the plot. The blow and the war-whoop were its first tokens, and nine tenths of the victims knew not the hand or the weapon which felled them. The deportment of Opechancanough himself to- * I    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6802-00000153"/> ,ards the English was uniformly affable and frank; nd it is said that '" he was often the equitable media- r in differences which arose between the English  id his countrymen.'"          ngl  The sad events of the 22d explained his "motions religion" and Iris behavior in regard to the death of emattanow.

Public en- terprises were abandoned;-the iron-works at Falling Creek, where all had been murdered but a girl and a boy; the glass-works at Jamestown, designed partic- ularly for the manufacture of beads for traffic; and the College. The people were crowded into a spacie too narrowy; the fields under cultivation were insuffi- cient for their wants; a scarcity of food followed, attended by much sickness; and many of the colo- nists hurriedly returned to England, o:r migrated to the tract of country afterwards known as North Caro- lina. The colonists soon numbered only twenty-five hundred, and the cattle but one thousand. As a commercial speculation, the I Virginia enter- prise was a failure. The visions of gold and pearls and precious stones which had floated before the eyes of the orignal members of the Company had proved baseless. Even the returns of real merchandise had been nothing in comparison with the moneys invest- ed, the profit from tobacco itself, the only staple of the country, having been forestalled by the arbitrary impositions of the king. When, therefore, the news of this fresh and bloody disaster was received, it pro- duced a great sensation in England. Many of the shareholders abandoned the enterprise, and sold their shares for what they could. But though the hopes of the speculators were crusled, the feelings of humanity were roused. New shareholders, touched with sym- pathy for their countrymen in the wilderness, readily took the places of the sellers, and contributions were raised to supply the necessities of the colony.

It was a spasmodic effort at generosity,--too :reat for his heart. He failed under it. The arms, adeed, he gave,---though historians say that they vere good for nothing; the powder he lent on the Jompany's bond; the soldiers never appeared. Captain Slnith, with the spirit of self-sacrifice for Thich he was always distinguished, offered himselfe [e did " intreat and monue "the Company "to use im "; offering to go in person to Virginia, and, by -od's assistance, to force the savages to leave the wuntry, or bring them into such subjection that every an should follow his business securely." He only ked that the company would furnish him with a hun- ed soldiers and the necessary supplies, waiving all mpensation save what " he ,himself could produce )m the proper labor of the savages." The Company a body did not act upon this proposition; but indi- lual members told him that the charges would be too eat, and the treasury was empty; but that he might tain leave, if he would give the Company half the lage!"  I would not give twenty pound for all the lage is to be got amongst the savages in twenty rs," is his indignant comment upon this overture. 'w, although the treasury was empty, yet the Coin- ly were even then proposing to raise a salary of O,000 per annum for a new and quixotic scheme; * $ Smith, 153. r   THE CLOUDLESS THUNDERBOLT.    299 and besides, so niggardly a reply to Smith's noble offer was utterly " at variance with the character of the Company and its leaders, who were rather profuse in their expenses for the good of the colony, than lying upon the catch for little advantages and mean gains." How, then, are the reply of individuals and the silence of the Company to be accounted for? for the offeir "was published in their Court."' When we consider that the Company then was not what it was when Smith was in its employ; that it was la:rgely -imbued with the elements of a high aristocracy; that lords and earls and bishops were among its members; that, ever since this change, he had uniformly been treated with neglect, and his services declined ; that it has ever been an axiom in British Councils;, "that high capacity is only to be supposed or encouraged in per- sons of rank," and also an axiom, "lthat offices of emolument and posts of honor belong of right and exclusively to the nobility,"--we may perhaps dis- cern the true reason. "Rather let three hundred and forty-seven more thioats be cut, than that honor ac- crue so cheaply to a mere soldier of fortune!" is not always inconsistent with the pride or the conscience of peerage. To this pride the commonalty of Eng- land have always succumbed; never has the public voice remonstrated against its exclusiveness, save in Cromwell's day, until the year 1854. During the summer following the massacre there were no special disturbances between ;he colonists and the natives.

But little was accomplished, how- ever, except the burning of wigwams, the seizure of some corn; and the destruction of more; for the In- dians, well acquainted with the country, expert at sly and noiseless movements in the woods, and nimble of foot, readily evaded pursuers who were encunbered with. armor. In many instances, the destruction of their corn and their huts was the work of the Indians themselves. At Pamunkey, the English were duped by specious promises and artful parleys, until the In- dians had transported most of their corn into the recesses of the forests. Some of the English were wounded by ambuscades; and they returned from their foray " slupposing- that they slew two "Indians, - a bootless and mortifying result. Another course was now adopted. "The Indians were invited'from their fastnesses by the hope of peace, and the solemn assurances of safety and for- giveness. Confiding in these, they returned to their bormer habitations and avocations." By this strata- Yem the colonists effected a sanguinary vengeance, 'without regard to age, sex, or infancy." In 1623 they organized several parties under dis- inct commands, who assaulted as many different lative settlements on the same day, the 23d of July, 'and slew great numbers."  The Indians, greatly educed in number, disabled, and driven back into the vilderness, abandoned to the English their fields and illages on the James and York Rivers.   CHAPTER XVIII. THE CHARTER ABROGATED. KING JAMES was in very ill humor. H:e did 1623. not like the Company. They traded in tobacco, which, he said, was only fit to regale the Devil after dinner," and against which he had published a book, - though he liked its revenue. Besides, the Company had become democratic in the spirit and style of their meetings for business, and upon these occasions said things which did not agree with his notions of the rights of kings, or with his exercise of "lkingcraft." They refused, sometimnes, to do as he wanted them to do; they talked about their Charter, about their rights under the Charter, about what were the rights of Englishmen, and about what were not the rights of kings. Rights! What right had they to canvass rights, -his rights, and their rights, and especially rights under their Charter? Charter, forsooth! Where did they get their Charter'? Was it not his gift of grace? To be sure it was; and if he could give it, he could take it again! They were getting naughty, troublesome; were plresuming to look their king in the face, and even to gainsay him sometimes. Again: they were ruling affairs oni another continent, - a part of his dominions, too,--and he chose to rule there himself. So he would take away their Charter, which they swaggered about so much, and teach the fellows 26 i,.       <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6802-00000156"/> 302   HE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. manners. If a charter made them great, he would show them that no Charter would make them little - the upstarts! He went to work accordingly. But he always pre- ferred a cunning, sneaking way of doing a thing, even when an honest, open', manly way would do it better. So lie manieuvred, and made men-tools to rake out his chestnuts with. We need not lay open the inter- nal history of the Company, nor James's long course of teasing tyranny towards them, nor his spiteful cru- sade against tobacco, their only source of revenue.* It is sufficient to say, that, while the king was resolved upon the dissolution of the Company, and to take the colony into his own hands, he wanted to do so with some show of decency. He would proceed, therefore according to the forms of law. He could do so safely; for in those days judges of courts judged as was the king's judgment., Thus hle would gain his end, and at the same time " impress the nation with an opinion of his justice and integrity." At least so he thought, although the nation :were not so mole-eyed as he sup- posed. But first he wanted to make it appear that there was some great reason for proceedings against the Company; that they had managed affairs very badly,-much against the welfare of his dear sub- jects' in Virginia.  To this end, he instigated flagrant charges against the Company; whether true or false was immaterial. The result of this was 'easily foreseen. Two papers, in particular, were presented to his Majesty,-the -one urging an examination of the state of things in * An elaborate history of these matters is given by Stith; a more compendious one, by Burk. 4               t v?   THE CHARTER ABROGATED.     303 Virginia, the other describing frightful evils there which could be remedied only "by a divine and supreme hand,"' meaning, of course, the hand of Kinog James. Upon this, he had his I'rivy Council appoint five Commissioners to examine Virginia it- self, and, right or wrong, to bring back an evil report of the land. Two of these, John Pory and John Harvey, Were sent from England; one, John Jefler- son, took no part in the matter, being a, hearty friend to the Company; and two, Samuel M[atthews and Abraham Percy, resided in Virginia. In the beginning of the year 1624, Captain Harvey and Mr. Pory arrived at Jamestown. On the 26th of January, warrants were issued for a General Assembly; not,. liowever, atthe suggestion of the Commissioners. The people had been advised of what had passed in England, and copies of the papers presented to the king had been received. The general purport of these papers was, that the colony, for the most part, had flourished while Sir Thomas Smith was the Company's manager, namely, until 1619, but had fallen into a wretched lstate since. To these statements the Assembly gave their first attention. They met on the 14th of February, and on the 20th had drawn up their answers, addressedl to the king and to the Privy Council. Their motives were, as stated in their own words, " that the world might not be abused with false reports." In one of these answers, they made the appalling statements whch we have cited on a previous page of our nar- rative Y In reference to the royal intention of a change * See Chapter XII.    <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6802-00000157"/> 304   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. of government, they took occasion also to address the Privy Council in the bold and spirited language of men resolute for political liberty. '"WeV desire," they said, " tht the governors sent over may not have absolute authority, but may be restrained to the con- sent of the Council.. We have found inconveniences by the strict limitations of Governor and Council to proceed according to their instructions out of Eng- land; for those things, in so far distance, might seem good advice which might happen to prove very incon- venient in execution; neither is it fit that any main project should be set on foot which had not first approbation from hence. ..... Above all, we make our humble request that we still retain the liberty of our General Assemblies, than which nothing could more conduce to the public satisfaction and public. utility." In the drafting and passing of these petitions and prpresentations, Sir Francis Wyatt, the Governor, was most strenuous, active, and cordial. "They were carried in Assembly with the utmost unanim- ity and despatch."'  The Commissioners artfully attemptned to entice the Assembly, and to make them play into the king's hand; but that body 'had too much spirit, intelli- gence, and self-respect, to demean themselves as tools in a quarrel between the king and the Com- pany. The Commissioners were baffled, and beyond measure chagrined; although the Assembly gave them every facility for obtaining true information respecting the state of the colony. Further than * Sec above, note, pp. 188, 189.   THE CHARTER ABROGATED.     305 this, they received no attentions whatever. The legislature proceeded to its ordinary business, "as if no such persons as the Commissioners had ever been in existence." The laws passed at this session show how strongly the Virginians, at that early day, were imbued with the spirit of rational, constitutional liberty. Among , other things, they enacted "that the Governor should not lay taxes, save by authority of the General As- sembly, to be levied and employed as they should appoint; thathe should not withdraw the inhabitants from their own labors to his; that, in case any public emergency should require their services before the Assembly could be convened, men should be levied by order of the Governor and the whoi'e body of the Council, and in such. a way as should be the least burdensome."  Thus did this excellent G(overnor, Sir Francis Wyatt, and the Burgesses of Virginia, pro- claim the fundamental principle of constitutional gov- ernment,-the sacred right of. the sulbject to his property and to the liberty of his pers;on; the very burden of that famous Petition of Rlight sanctioned as law by Charles the First in 1628, amid the accla- mations of the British Parliament, and to the universal joy of the nation n Other important laws --and these are the earliest laws of Virginia now extant-- were passed at this session of the legislature. They chiefly related to the church and its ministry,. the administration of justice, the raising of crops, and the protection of the planters against the Indians. It was also ordered, that, "at ; * Hume's Iistory of England, Chap. II., Vol. II . p.429, Philadelphia edition, 1822.

Yet there was one domestic evil, extensively pre- vailing and seriously affecting the peace and happi- ness of the communnity, with reference to which this Assembly, with all their zeal for the public good, did not legislate. ri'his neglect is not easily to be ac- counted for; but certain it is, that they left for the Governor to do that which, as fathers of the people, they should have done themselves.  There was in' the colony a tendency to matrimony. An attempt to check it would have been neither politic nor avail- able. Yet it certainly required the interference of civil authority in some shape, it was producing such melancholy consequences. A young man, attracted by the lively features, the rosy health, and the efficient housewifery of a young maiden, woos lher smiles and wins them. A second, a thi'd, a fourth even, are equally encouraged, and to each in course she is pledged as a wife. Thus the fair one appropriates to herself four times her fair pro- portion of the mystic delights of courtship, while her suitors; each unsuspicious of a rival, are building castles in the air, and dreaming vain dreams about children and children's children. Fancy their-chagrin, fancy their indignation, fancy their possible quarrels, when the truth is discovered,-heretofore good neigh- bors and warm friends, now inveterate rivals! .Each has his claims, each has his darling plans for the future, each has his honest and manly attachment for the fair one and false, and neither is disposed to yield.

So prevalent was the   habit of coquetry, that no bachelor could feel confident of becoming a married man until the vows had been exchanged at the altar. A bad state of society this!   Hearthurnings, aliena- tions, feuds, it certainly produced; perhaps duels and bloodshed, maiming  and death.  The women said it was the fault of the men; they were so many, so ardent, so importunate, and so determined, that they would not be denied; and that a "Yes" for every wooer was the only means for the women to live in "peace."  In this there was doubtless some truth. On the other hland, the men, to justify the ardor and pertinacity of their courtship, pleaded the great scarcity of woren,-e  a fact which none could dis- pute.  Sir Francis Wyatt said " that the fault was in' the women, that; their behavior was a cryingi sin,' (to be sure it was!) "' that it must be stopped.   He would not have the'men trifled with so."     And as there was no Sir dLEcini Sandys now     in power in Engrland to import "( virgins young and uncorru)pt," Sir Francis resorted to the only other means of re- forming the bad manners of the women.     He issued a proclamation forbidding any one to contract herself @ I find no trace of young women being sent o'ver "to makle wives " after -the year 1620, until 1632, under Which date is the following by Burk (II. 36): "It appears by a regulation of the Council, that this in- teresting object of tiade was yet continued. The' seeming want of deli- cacy in this procedure, which sprang from necessity alone, is qualified by the nice and pointed attention paid to the chastity and reputation of their wives'before, and their delicate and liberal deportment to them after marriage. By an Order of Council of this year, two maids, each of whom had made afaux pas during the passage, were ordered to be sent back, as unworthy to propagate the race of Virginians."    <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6802-00000159"/> 308   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. to more than one man at once. He ordained that "what womnan .oever should use any woid or speech tending to a contract of marriage to 'two several per- sons at the same time, although not precise and legal, yet so as might entangle or breed scruple in their con- sciences, should, for such her offence, either undergo corporal correction, or be punished by fine, or other- wise, accprding to the quality of the person so offend- ing." This last clause indicates that the offence was not limited to a class. It is to be hoped that the evil habit of these early brides of Virginia was so season- ably corrected as t;o prevent its hereditary transmis- sion. Doubtless it was. The Commissioners returned to England soured in their feelings toward the Virginian Assembly, anid irritated by their failure to involve that body in the schemes of the king. rTheir report to James was framed according to his wishes. Tlereupon, in July, he suspended the action of the Company by procla- mation, pushed the legal inquiry into its conduct and pretensions, and the Court of the King's Bench gave judgment that the Charter was forfeited. Thus the Company was arbitrarily and violently dissolved, and. the government of Virginia reverted to the crown. No compensation was made to the shareholders for their large and generous expenditures, which had been equivalent to nearly seven hundred thousand dollars. Thus the crown of England acquired an established and thriving colony cheap! It was the greatest finan- cial operation of the king. He survived it only eight months; and when he was laid in his tomb, no one wept.   "HAPTER   XIX. ANNALS. No plan of government for Virginia was de- 1(24. termined upon by th e king when the Company was dissolved. He wrould frame one in his closet, he said. But death interfered before he had matured it. He had, however, issued a royal commission to Sir Francis WTyatt as Governor, and had appointed eleven gontlemen as his Cotncil, or assistants, to administer 'the government of the colony until he should have perfected a permanent arrangement for the future. The colonists had petitioned his Majesty on three several points; one of which was " that the use of Assemblies might be continued"; but to this prayer the king paid no attention. The fact that in the com- mission tod Wyatt "all mention of Assemblies was omitted," does by no nmeans indicate their suppres- sion. The subject was simply tntouched by James. Upon the accession of Charles to the throne, 12 he adopted the same arrangement for the col- ony which James had left, expressly declaring, how- ever, that it was only an arrangement for the time being, until he could decide uponi a permanent one. In his comission for this purpose, he also made no mention of an Assembly.      l In the next year, Wyatt leaving Virgiinia  to attend to his estate at home, Sir GeOrge    <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6802-00000160"/> Yeardley succeeded him    as Governor.

He now returned with a rankling rememebrance of the mortification which he had then encountered, when vainly attempting to tamper with the Assembly. He hated Assemblies, and it was the aim of  his policy to bring them  into disuse. Yet he  convened his first on the 24th of March, 1630..

This course was at first sec- onded by the Council, who were soon, however, like the Burgesses, reduced to the condition of puppets. Both bodies were probably led, for a wlile, to submiti in silence, from an unwillingness to be found in col- lision with the representative of their king. But soon the exactions, the inhumanity, and the insolence of the Governor became intolerable. The people be- came indignant, clamorous, and even inclined to open resistance. The Council now sympathized with the 131 people. The Assembly which was convened in February, 1631, boldly exercised their rights. After remaining quiet until the imonth of March, they passed a law forbidding the levying of any tax with- out the consent of the Assembly; and they also en- acted "Lthat the Governor should in future have no power to enforce the services of the colonists for his private benefit, or to levy them for war, without the consent of the Council'. Both these acts seem to have been only re-enactments of the laws of 1624 on the same points. The acts of all former Assemblies, this Assembly repealed; hence, doubtless, the passage of these acts at this time. The Governor found it vain to contend with the sturdy spirit,which he had roused, and the acts received his official approval. About this time the king issued to his favorites grants of land, which lay within the geographical limits of Virginia. A particular notice of these grants belongs more appropriately to the histories of Mary- land and Carolina. It is sufficient here to say, that they were resented by the -Virginians as encroach- ments upon their rights; that Governor Harvey sec-   ANNALS.        313 onded the course of the sovereign, and that he even gave away, in conjunction with 'certain royal commis- sioners, not only large tracts of the land belonging (ac-' cording to the ethics of the day) to the crown, but oth- ers, belonging to private planters. Thus matters 163 went on until April and May, 1635, when' the -Council peremptorily deposed Harvey from office, "'until the king's pleasure should be known "; and the Assembly, in comnpliance with a petition from the planters, collected evidence of the charges against him, to be presented to the king by a deputation from their owrn body. These charges were " haughtiness, rapa- city, and cruelty, contempt of the rights of the colo- nists, and usurpation of the privileges of the Council." He was sent to E]ngland with the delegates of the Assembly, that his case might be presented to the king. Charles, viewing the deposition of a royal governor in the light of a treasonable act, was highly incensed, refused audience to the delegates, and im- mediately ordered the return of Harvey, and his re- installation in office. He resumed his station 136 in January, 1636, and held it until displaced by Sir Francis WTyatt, iln November, 1639. By a law of this year (1639), "Jamestown was fixed upon as the permanent seat of government." Wyatt gave place to Sir William Berleley, who arrived with the king's commission, and assumed the govern- 1642. ment in February, 1642. Upon the return of Harvey to Virginia, and by virtue of his new com-. mission, the Council had been denied the right to fill their own vacancies. The crown had reserved it to itself. But under the commission to Berkeley, 27    <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6802-00000162"/> 314   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. the king waived this right, an restored it to the Council.  In March, Sir Williaml convoked the Assembly. He had been educated at Oxford, where he had taken the degree of Master of Arts in 1629. He had then travelled extensively in Europe, and was " the perfect model of an elegant courtier and a high-minded cava- lier." He was remarkable for his high sense of honor, and for his urbanity in the common intercourse of life, and seems to have been, at least at this time, a generous and warm-hearted man. With these quali- ties and accomplishments, lie rendered himself at once personally acceptable to the Virginians; and, although he was a stanch royalist, and largely imbued with the spirit and political sentiments of his sovereign, yet his administration was mild, and "he cordially co-operat- ed with the Council and the House of Burgesses in measures calculated to secure the liberties of the colo- ny." Under these circumstances, there was harmony between the Governor and the Assembly; and the colonists, enjoying general prosperity, were content. An event now occurred of no small political impor- tance. George Sandys had been sent to England as an agent for the colony, "with particular instructions to oppose the re-establishment of the Company"; a project, it seems, for which several attempts had been made in England.*  Betraying his trust, Sandys had presented to the House of Commons, and in the name of his constituents, a petition for the restoration of * For the particulars of this transaction, I rely upon a tract entitled "An Extract from a Manuscript Collection of, Annals relating to Vir- ginia," in Force, Vol. III.   ANNALS.        315 the Company. So soon as this was known in Vir- ginia, the Assembly acted upon it with spirit and de- cision. Although the people had been averse to the dissolution of the Company, yet they had since en- joyed, for the most part, so great tranquillity and pros- perity, and were so secure in their rights as freemen, that they were yet more averse to any further change. The Assembly immediately passed an act disavowing the proceeding of Sandys. In their protest, they in- veighed severely, and, if we consider only their con- dition under the Company from 161'9 to 1624, singu- larly; though truthfully enough, if the whole term of the Company's existence be considered. They posi- tively refused to submit to that Company, " or to ANY OTH-IER"; and gave at large and earnestly their rea- sons for this refusal. But not content with this, they proceeded further, and issued their solemn declaration and protestation against the measure suggested. "We, the Governor, Council, and Burgesses, ..... having taken into serious consideration, &amp;c.,..... do declare and testify to all THE WORL]), that we will NEvER admit the restoring of said Company, or any for and in their behalf. .....

House of Burgesses; and they immediately applied to the king for his confirmation of it. This transaction was not only highly important' and interesting, as marking the noble and determined spirit with which the Virginians met any attempt to inter- fere with their civil privileges, but as the cause of a. most important act on the part of the crown. The Declaration, Protestation, and Act of the Assembly were returned with the royal assent. We give the letter of the liing in substance. " CHARLES, REX. "Trusty and' well-beloved, we greet you well.

Yet the conflict was by no means decisive, [ r   THE CHEF S LAST STRUGGLE.   319 and probably it displayed a strength and spirit on the part of the Indians which the English did not wish further to provoke. The latter had aimed to proceed four miles beyond the field of conflict, where was the chief depot of the Indians, and where, after the en- gagement, they had rallied. But Sir Francis, for some reason, -possibly "the want of ammunition," - saw fit to retire. Of Itopatin - or Opitchapan, as he is usually called -- we have no further account. Still hostilities were not suspended. The colonists haid laid waste by fire a belt of land along their fron- tier settlements; thus destroying the luxuriant grass, the thick undergrowth, and the gigantic trees, under cover of which the Indians had been wont to creep unseen, and thence, like the tiger, to pounce upon their prey. But even this precautioa had availed little. The savage, burning with mortal hatred, would. patiently bear hunger, and wNatching, and exposure, and any discomfort, to secure from the plantations a, single scalp. Many: sudden irruptions had been made upon the settlements in days when the inhabitants were off their guard, or in nights when darkness andy rushing rain combined to conceal approach. In this  fitful and stealthy way the savages had conducted their wfafare, plundering the plantations of corn and cattle, butchering men, taking captive women and children, and then suddenly disappearing, without a trace of their retreat, into the depths' of the wilderness. So vigilant, so untiring, so stealthy was their system, that the English, unless in strong parties, had not dared to move where it was possible for an Indian to lurk. Not only had the enemy assailed the more exposed plantations, but had taken scalps and captives and plunder, had ravaged cornfields and buirned houses, in    <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6802-00000165"/> 320   THE YOUTH OF .THE OLD DOMNION. the more central parts of the colony. Thus matters had continued between the natives and the English until February, 1632, when the Chickahominies and the Pamunkeys, after a furious and destructive attack upon the whites, agreed upon a treaty of peace. It was a treaty, however, in which little confidence was placed. Though the plantations had steadily in- creased, and been pushed farther and farther into the wilds, still the colonists were apprehensive of attack, and many acts both for offence and defence had passed the Assembly. For the greater security of the people against treachery and surprise, all intercourse with the Indians had been peremptorily forbidden by law, ex- cept at particular stations upon the frontiers, and even there only for purposes of traffic. The thirty tribes composing the confederation, or empire,- all broth- ers and all Powhattans," -- had, step by step, been pushed back from the sea to the falls of the rivers,- from the falls to their sources. In the dark places of their retreat, they still brooded over their wrongs, and plotted revenge. On a gentle swell of land near the sources of the York or Pamunkey River was now the residence of the aged Opechancanough. Scattered here and there, over perhaps an acre of ground, were some twenty or thirty wigwams, of the conical shape such as were the usual dwellings of the common people. Inter- spersed among these were a few gigantic trees covered with the fresh foliage of spring, - it was the' 17th day of April, 1644.' Around this group of huts was an x The date of these events is determined by Winthrop, II. 165, and Hening, I. 450.   THE CHEF'S LAST STRUGGLE.    321 area of sixty acres or more under tillage, on which many trees were still standing, but bald and barlless, and about the roots blackened by fire, or girdled with wounds by the hatchet. These, together with the im- perfect manner in which the soil was brolken up, indi- cated that the settlement was comparatively new. A numb1er of Indian womeni and children were engaged, in different spots and companies, in beating up the ground witlh crooked sticks, - a few, with English hoes, -in planting corn, or in weeding that which had already begun to grow. In the centre of the vil- lage, and enclosing four or five venerable oaks, were ihree large circles of palisades, ten or twelve feet in height, one within another, and with intermediate spaces of five or six feet. Within this simple fortifi- cation were the dwellings of the chief and his im- mediate attendant.. These structures were of the better sort,-of an oblong area, their roofs forming an arch, and varying from sixty to a hundred feet in length. The largest was that of the chief himself, who was supposed to be now about a hundred years of age. It was at once his private dwelling and his council-hall. This was a day of convocation. Ranged around the walls was a concourse of sturdy chiefs and war- riors equipped for the war-path. The younger men were placed behind the elder, and were distinguished for the artificial hideousness of their appearance. One of the ancients had just finished a stirring address to the assembly, and had taken his seat. For a few moments a deathke silence indicated the impression he had made. The young mten grasped their weap- ons, and. panted with impatience. The -old men, sul- len and stern, bent their eyes upon the ground.    <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6802-00000166"/> 322   THE YOUTI OF THE OLD DOMNION. "Uttomatin has spoken well," muttered Opechan- canough from the couch on which he lay. "The hunter has half done his work when he has set his snares. Our snares are set. Our warriors are at their posts. The time has come." Then, raising himself from his couch, and dropping his mantle, he stood up, leaning upon the arms of two attendants; and every warrior also rose, from instinctive reverence for their patriarch king. They waited in profound silence for his words. It was an impressive scene. The largq and noble frame of Opechancanough had become bowed, emaciated, and shrivelled; but he stood as kingly and as stern in purpose as when in the vigor of his days, and the thin, whitened scalp-lock, which drooped to his shoul- der, seemed a symbol of his many changes and many griefs. The muscles of his face were working strong-  ly under the influence of his emotions, and every one around him caught their inspiration; but his own eyes were closed. After a moment's pause; he said: "Opechancanough would see his friends." The two chiefs who supported him, each gray with. age, gently, and as if touching something holy, took hold of his palsied eyelids, and unveiled his sight. The fire of life had abated in his veins; the nerve of his youth and the iron vigor of his manhood were gone for ever; but from that old man's eye shot forth a fire and a vigor, of purpose which told of a spirit within unrivalled by the most impetuous in his presence.

"Let the runners now be sent. "Children! remember what Opechancanough has said. He has done." The venerable chief, releasing the veterans who held his eyelids, gathered his mantle around him, and sank upon his seat. Instead of the acclamations and frantic pantomimes with which such addresses were usually received, the only sign of approval given was a low but portentous murmur, so profound was the impression upon all,. that the expedition on foot was one of no common moment, that the fate of their nation was at stake. Most of the warriors immediately retired, and sped to their several stations. A few, grizzled and scarred, lingered for a short time to press the hand of their aged chief, or to receive its sign of blessing as they knelt reverently at his feet. Opeclancanough \was soon left with only his customary attendants. Soon after midnight on the morning of the 18th, Opechancanough left his dwelling under escort of a small band of warriors, who were to act at different points as his lieutenants, and whom he had selected k   T'IE CHEF'S LAST STRUGGLE.        325 for their personal valor, their co  judgment, and their capacity for military co-operation.   His infirmities of limb, as well as the falling of his eyelids, prevented him from  proceeding on foot.   A litter was therefore prepared for him, upon which his devoted followers, emulous of the service, transported him   from place to place as he directed;.  The localities of the country- over which he had roamed again and aigain for nearly a century " were traced so clearly upon his mnind, that his orders were unenmbarrassed by the veil which over- hung his vision; and that -lis mental capacity for war was unimpaired   by age is evident   in the plan on which he acted, and in the concert which he sustained between the distant parties of his expedition. The escort, with their venerable burden, threaded their way in silence and with. perfect ease through the wilds.  The double curtain of forest-shade and night was no hinderance to their certain, and even rapid motion.

It might have been an hour, or a  little more, before one from an umvlooded position there could have discerned the. first strealk of"day, -when the patriarch chief and his attendants entered upon what seemed a natural opening of the forest, Hardly had the tramp of the party ceased, as the litter was placed upon the turf, when the soft tread of the moccason was heard by their practised ears, and one by one came warriors frolm the surrounding covert, until hundreds stood around their king. The star- light in the open space was sufficient to reveal the wild ferocity of their aspect; yet even that was soft- ened for the moment when they bent eagerly for- ward to discern, as each one might be able, the reclining form before thenm. The attitude, the sup- pressed breathing, the hushed movernent of the crowd, betokened the filial affection, and even religious awe, of every wsarrior. So predominant were these senti- ments, and sp completely had they chastenedl the fero- cious expression of their features, that they seenmed just then less like bancitti, gathered for a great and pitiless slaughter, than ,like brothers Nwho had come there to see a venerated father, or like worshippers who had met at a common altar. The halt was brief. Opechancanough, half raising himself upon his litter, made a few brief inquiries, and gave order for immediate and :rapid march. In- stantly separating into twenty or thirty parties, the rwhole band departed in'as many different directions; the chief, with his former attendants only, pursuing a   i ,trail by themselves. Half -an hour afterwards, they emerged from the wood', and again halted upon the skirts of a plantation. But a few minutes elapsed   THE CHEF'S LAST STRUGGIE.    327 when other parties arrived, and soon the chief was surrounded by a much larger assemblage than he hadL before met in the glade of the forest. A few rapid and nervous orders from his lips, and a few stinging allusions to the rapacious piracy of 1the white man and to the bitter wrongs of the Indian, were enough. The warriors noiselessly dispersed, and. with them the chosen ones who hatd tlhus far been the attendants of their chief, - others, though burning to share in the work of death, content with the honor of watching by his side. The few clouds which had been drifting overhead were gone, and a clearer light was shed over the peaceful landscape. At a short distance lay the rude farm-house of a pioneer planter, witlh its cluster of out-buildings around it; and, what was unusual except upon the frontier, two or three others;' could be faintly seen within the compass of half a mile. * So close a neighborhood was for the purpose of mutual protection. "' Children!" said Opechancanpough, and rising to his feet, " let me see the work of my braves." His eyelids were immediately held up. He turned his head slowly towards the east, and saw the first tint of morning. Then, looking steadfastly upon the cottages of his foes, he murmured, ' Wahunsonacoclk;  Wahunsonacock! 9' - Not ten minutes more had elapsed, when a slight flash was seen by the side of the nearest dwelling.

Other lights were now seen at the other and more distant houses, and soon they too began to blaze and spread. Very soon, for the walls of the dwellings were very dry, the fire ran up to the several roofs, and their thatch, combustible as tinder, was in a blaze. Now for the first time there was noise-- a shriek; then the dreadful war-whoop, an- swered from the more distant houses, and also from some invisible scene of slaughter eastward within the forest. Then came the yells and curses of mortal strife; then a shout; and there in the firelight were seen two forms struggling, life for life; and then came another rushing forward, a white garment flut- tering about it, and long hair streaming in the wind, and it threw itself upon the two fighting ones as if it had been a Fury; and the three fell and rolled to- gether upoln the ground. There was a struggle, a' death-scream, and then in the glare of the fire the tawny victor was seen astride his victims, and fran- tically waving aloft their dripping scalps. Like sounds of strife and death came also from beyond, but the eye of the chief could see there only the con- flagration; and at the eastward, and at two or three points southward, the tree-tops were lighted by un- seen fires, whose smoke was going up to heaven, a. testimony of the wrath of man. And now came the cry of swine, the bleating of sheep, the death-bellow of cattle, and then came - silence. Two, -three, - four, - half a dozen runners, one after another, now dashed breathless into the presence of the chief, reeling with blood and singed with fire. q.   THE CHEF1S LAST STRUGGLE:.   329 Each stood silent and motionless until questioned; received a quick, short order in reply to his message; and darted away again whence he came. The morn- ing had now fairly broken. The eastern sky was flooded, with' light. Opechancanough, taking a last look of satisfaction at the smouldering ruins before him, reclined upon his litter again, gave directions to his attendants, and was carried away to superintend other scenes of havoc, and to- keepup his communica- tions with his chiefs. Thus resolutely and with untiring industry did this aged warrior direct the work whiLch he could not share along the tributary streams of the Pamunkey, laying the border settlements in ashes, and strewing / them with corpses. To each of the bands under his immediate direction he assigned their several routes. He also, according to circumstances, checked or urged their progress, knowing all the time -where each was in operation. He, himself moved in concert with them, and to stations convenient for communication with all. Thus the work of carnage and of burning went on through the day, through the night, through the next day and the next night, the resolute chief- tain hardly allowing a moment's repose to himself or to his warriors. rThe frontier settlements had been forced and sacked, and the work had steadily pro- gressed, from all points, toward the interior. ,For, in the mean time, other tribes under other chiefs had seized tomahawk and firebrand at the same hour on the 18th; at distant points, and on other routes. From the heads of all the rivers, from the south side of James River, and from the north side of the Pamunkey or York River, different hordes 28*    <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6802-00000170"/> 330   THE YOUTH OP THE OLD DOMNION. had been hewing their way toward the centre of the colony, with all vigor and with unsparing exe- cution. Everywhere along these tracts were strewed the sad and revolting relics of a pitiless war. The corn in the blade was cut up. The corn in store was cast upon the 'embers of the habitations slaughtered cat- tle and sheep and swine and men apd women and children lay around on the desolated homesteads; household furniture and fanning tools were scattered about in fragments, or burned to ashes, - in short, the ruin was as universal and as complete as human malice and swift industry could make it. In addi- tion, many were carried into barbarous and hopeless captivity, - some to linger in slavery, some ,to be hewn bit by bit under the knife, sorne to be slowly barbecued ' at the stake. Nowhere was the work more frightful or rapid than on the track of Opechancanough and the favorite tribes under his personal command. They consti- tuted the, main strength 'of the Powhattans. They were the most courageous, the most fierce, the most implacable in their hatred of the English, and the most familiar with, the modes of English warfare; and well did they sustain their reputation. through these terrific days and nights. But their fame outran their havoc. Some who were attacked escaped, and fled on the wings of, terror to the inland settlements. The alarm quickly spread.

Opechancanough saw at once that the array of the English was. complete and resistless, that the onset of sword and firelock, and cavalry could not be sustained."     He gave the order for retreat,t and vanished with his exhausted bands into the depths of the wilderness,.    The other chiefs operating in other districts were also compelled to retire before the' superior weapons and fresh forces of the English. About five hundred colonists had perished.

The time-worn warrior of Pamunkey was ready to die whenever the Great Spirit would call him ; and yet he scorned to die. H[e could meet his spirit- fathers on their pleasant hunting-grounds without shame; for he had been a faithful Powhattfil for a hundred years. He had bared his breast to many a storm; he could bare it to more, seared and shrivelled :" as it was. It was not for him to cower like a wo- man; it was not for him to weep and whine like a child, under the Whip of sorrow. A warrior he had lived; a warrior he would die. He could not wield the tomahawl, but lie could direct the fight. In this mood had he retired before the mustering forces of the English, and- betaken himself to his secluded home. He had .done so only to save his men ; only that he might rallyr and redirect them to more equal conflicts. To this'latter task, therefore, he girded himself, with the stern purpose of a hero and the dig- nity of a martyr. His spies and runners were busy in all quarters, while his warriors stoodlwaiting his di- rections or went with enthusiasm to obey them ; and rarely was. a detachment of the English' abroad, but he sent out his ambuscades for scalps. But his rest- less spirit could not brook inaction. ' He would be abroad himself also, to watch and trap the marauders of his country, to hear their cries when struck down by his warriors, though he might not share the con- flict. Thus, while planning and directing the opera- tions of war, he was also carried by his men upon various hostile excursions. 'Upon one of these--it was, as nearly as we can calculate, in the latter part of May or early in June - he lay upon his litter, under a cool shade in the forest,   THE CHEF'S LAST STRUGGLE.    333 "at some dista'nce from. his usual habitation." He hacd been in motion for several days and nights; and now, overcome with fatigue and the heat of noon, he had given himself up to a short repose. He slept. But it was evident from the tone of his inarticulate mutterigs, and' from the passions gleaming upon his features', that the old man was youngr again in his dreams, and was reacting the strifes of fourscore years ago. His attendants Wvere watching around him in silence. Suddenly a warrior w-ho had been reclining upon the ground sprang noiselessly to his feet, with a look of alarm, and almost at the same instant a sen- try, who had been stationed at a short distance, dashed into the circle and announced the coming of English. They were close at hand, he said, and flight was out of the question. Three or four others now came hurriedly in from different points, bringing the samle report. T'hey were surrounded, and were not more than a dozen. Without a. wcrd, - for they were of one mind, an d knew it, -they stood shoulder to shoulder around their srlumbering chief, every man with his arrow upon his bow'. But; even the slight noise attending their movement had roused the sleep- er from his dreams. He had but just 'uttered a word of inquiry, when the English soldiers - some thirty or forty ini number - presented themselves on every side. Every arrow was sped at the instant, and every one found its mark,-but harmless against armor. The assailants, with only broadswords. rushed shbut- in- and at once upon the party. One :[ndian had but just time to throw himself as a shield upon the sacred person of the chief, before the soldiers were' upon them.  Another, aiming a blow with his 'war-club,    <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6802-00000172"/> 834   THE YOUTH O THE OLD DOMNION. received a sabre-stroke upon his shobulder, and fell bleeding upon the litter. A few others were stunned and slightly wounded, but all were overpowered by numbers. The struggle was over almost as soon as begun, and every Indian but the chief was pinioned. It had been the purpose of the soldiers to capture, if possible, without lthe loss of life. Tlhey had succeed- ed. Their leader, and one of the foremost in the on- set,, was Sir William   Berkeley. He hlad obtained information--in what manner we are not told- where Opechancano-Lgh waEs. Instantly placing him- self at the head of a squadron of light cavalry, he had -ridden with all speed to the spot, and, by an adroit approach and skilful precaution', had effected the sur- prise. He now addressed himself courteously and re- spectfully to the helpless chief, announcing thllat he should convey him to Jamestown. To this he made no r'eply, but, turning his closed eyes toward Sir VWillialm, asked sharply: " Are my children hurt ?  Who fell at my feet ?" " Uttomatin," replied a voice from the ground. " Is Uttomatin hurt ? " turning his face in the direc- tion of the voice.

The infirmities of the chief were well known to the English, and one of the soldiers stepped forward and raised his eyelids.    Not a glance didl the old man bestow upon his victors, until he had scannedthe per-     THE CHEF'S LAST STRUGGLE.    335 son of each one of his faithful warriors. Then, turn- ing to Sir William, ]he said, in the tone of a demand, ".Let them be unbound." "On one condition,-- they shall not attempt escape." The chief looled in the eye of the English noble- man with a right royal pride, and his lip curled with scorn. "Do the white men run away Nwhen their king is taklen captive? Opechancanough's, children die with him."' "It is enough,l replied Sir William, and the pris- oners were loosed. Deprived of their weapons and surrounded by the soldiers, the Indians now took up the litter of their captive king, and proceeded to the spot where the horses of the, party had been picketed. Opechanca- nough declined all conversation, and manifested a dignified indifference to his fate. TCheir progress to Janmestownn was without incident, except that the cap- tives, especially their chief, naturally athtracted, at their halting-places, such of the plante:rs on the route as had chanced to hear' of their approach. The ex- treme age of the chief inspired the people with rever- ence; his infirmities woke their pity; his history as a persevering and heroic foe excited their respect'; the majesty of his port, his undaunted aspect, and the filial devotion of his followers, commanded their ad- miration. Thus, wien the cavalcade entered James- town, although it was triumphal, and although the captives were a spectacle unto all; tiot a scoff grated upon their ears, or -a jeer, or an exultant shout, from all the mixed populace.

To this honorable sentiment and behavior the example of Sir William Berkeley contributed not a little. He appreciated the character of the captive warrior, and the filial devoted- ness of his attendants, aijd consequently demeaned himself towards them with all deference. They were his prisoners, to be sure, and of course in confinement and under guard; but he granted them every indul- gence in his power. None of his attendants were separated from the chief. Their touching anxiety for his comfort, and to serve him in their persons, Sir William would not interfere with. So Opechanca- nough in his prison-house had his court about him. He now felt that his last struggle was over; that his allotted work as a counsellor, as a warrior, as a king and father to his people, was done. He had nothing' more before him but to die like a warrior and a king. Yes, one thing more, le thought, and then - death. His old flesh must feel the knife, and crisp before the fire, and his old 'bones be crushed by the executioner, before his spirit might join the spirits of his fathers. The ingenuity of the wyhite man would invent unheard-of tortures for his most inveterate and successful enemy. Upon all this Opechancano ugh calculated; and so did his followers, for him, for them- selves. But his demeanor was that of a captive who felt himself a, king in every inch, - unbending, haughty, reserved, unsolicitou s about his fate. But whenever he spake of it, which was seldom, it was only to ex- press contempt for the torture-skill of the. pale-face, and to defy his power.  L -   THE CHEF'S LAST STRUGGLE.    337 But had not Opechancanough known the English thirty-five years? and did he not know that English- men'did not kill their war-captives by torture? Torture! was there no fashion of torture among Englishmen?  Were there no "thumb-screws ' in Christian England then? no ' boots :? 'no . scaven- ger's daughters"? no stakes and fagots? no disem- bowellings? no hanging by the neck, ' but not until dead"? no cutting-down of the sufferer while the pulse yet beat, that he might feel the lnife which laid his vitals 'bare, and the hand which tore out his heart to toss it on burning coals? Were there no such things in glorious England then? none long after ' To be sure there were! But Opechancanough did not know them. Perhaps not. But he knew  some other things. He knew what things the English did to' each other in Virginia. He knew what they had done to prison- ers among, themselves.  He knew  that they had thrust irons through their tongues; that they had broken live men's bones upon the wheel; that they had chained men to trees, and left them there to starve, alone in the forest; that some men they had burned;* that, at least, they did cut off the hands of Indian prisoners t Could Opechancanough expect better execution for himself, their bloody enemy for so many years, than they had given to their owni brethren? If they had done such things in the green tree, what would they do in the dry?

But however he may have reasoned, and on what.-   g :ver grounds he may have formed his expectations, one thing is certain, -he expected death by excruci--  sting torture,'but lie scorned it. Sir William was about to sail for IEngland, and the fate to which he had doomed his captive was--a voyage. It, would be such an honor 'to his name to present to his sovereign the champion-warrior of the Indians, and their king! Besides, what confusion to those in England who libelled Virginia as a pestilen- tial country, to see one of the inhabitants who had shaken hands with an hundred years! But this was not to be. The. chief and his men were considerately permitted. to enjoy the fresh air and the warm sun, without which they would soon have .. , pined and died. While enjoying this-privilege one day, - it was a fortnight after his captuire, - the aged king was suddenly fired upon by one of his guards, in a fit of passion. The 'ball lodged in his back, inflicting a mortal wound. The Indians were frantic w;ith rage. Unarmed as they were, they flew- like panthers at the ruffian soldier, and would have torn him to shreds but for the instant protection of his comrades. The roar of savage frenzy was bootless; and they turned, utter- ing wild cries of lament, to retire with their wounded patriarch to their apartment. Here they tried their rude skrill to stanch the blood, and to revive his con. sciousness. The stern men, from whom no tortures 3, could have wr-ung a sign of suffering, dropped tears and groaned'over Opechancanough. Sir William Berkeley was greatly incensed at the outrage, and did all in his power to prevent a fatal  result. Surgical aid: and proper attendance were pro-            ' ' t/   THE CHEF S LAST STRUGGLE.    339 vided for the chief, but with no seeming benefit. It soon became evident that he must die. He lingered, however, for several days. He gave no utterance of suffering, and no sign of dejection. He spake but few words, and those chiefly to his followers; but in many ways he discovered to the last an unbroken pride, a stoical indifference to his falte, and a lofty contempt for every Englishman who intruded upon his presence. He betrayed none of 1the milder feelings of human nature, except by the silent but eloquent affection with which he ieceived the services of his countrymen. Now and then it was displayed in the satisfaction with which he would gaze upon his at tendants for a few moments, and in the look of fare- 'well with which he would then order his eyelids to be dropped. . His children, as he always called them, were about him  night and day. .It would have moved the hardest heart to witness the breathless anx- iety with which they bent over his couch; the big tears which sometimes dropped from. their eyes, in spite of their pride; the womanly tenderness with whichi they relieved his posture, or ministered to his b-urning thirst; the gentle tones in which they asked his wants; 'the noiseless- tread with which they moved ; the tremulous whispers in which they spake; and the sullen anguish with which 1;hey sometimes sank writhing on the flooi. "The strong men bowed themselves.'" "Uttomatin!" whispered the dying patriarch, "why are my children so noisy? Let them be silent." "They are the pale-faces,. my father. They come to see." A frown clouded the brow of Opechancanough.  Uttomatin! let me see." i  .    <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6802-00000175"/> 340    THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. As his eyes were opened, he gave a look at the in- truders upon his privacy, beneath which some of them shrank,   brutal as they were. "Raise me, Uttomatin!'  The warrior did   so, supporting the dying    man against his breast. "Let the chief of the white men be called.       He must come instantly.   Opechancanough demands it." When Sir William   shortly after appeared, the chief with great effort attained to a full and strong voice, and said, with a look of right royal scorn: "Shame,-- shame to the pale-face chief, who makes a gazing- stock of his captive on a dying bed! Had it been my fortune to have taken Sir William Berkeley prisoner, I would have given him    honor, such as a great chief should have, at the stake, and in the presence of my braves.  But I would not meanly have liept himn for a show.  A dog has a right to peace and privacy when the hand of the .Great Spirit is upon him." - Soon after, the scene closed.   Opechancanough had fulfilled his course.  His spirit had returned unto God who gave it.  - I have varied the traditionaqr words of Opechancanough only so far as to give what I believe to have been his real meaning. The historian who retorts that he " made a show "' of Captain Smith, should remember that Opechancanough 'made no complaint that he, like Captain Smith, was made a show on his progress to the head-quar- ters of his captors ;and that there is a heaven-wide difference between the exhibition of a military captive in a triumphal procession, and the admission of a gaping rabble to the private apartment of a dying man. 'Opechancanough was consistent with himself, with his'own behavior, with his own high sense of honor. .His rebuke was as sound as cAustic; and, had the supposition on which it was made - that Sir William was privy to the transaction --been true, it would have been infamously deserved.   CHAPTER XXI, VIRGINIA AND CROMWELL. IN the same month in which Opechanca- nough died, Sir William Berkeley sailed for 1645. England, disappointed of his trophy. He returned, however, and resumed thee duties of his office in June of the next year. In October, 1646, a treaty of peace was effected with Necotowance, the successor of Opechancanough. He acknowledged himself a tributary of the king of England, and ceded to the English all the country be- tween the York and James rivers. In March, 1648, he came in person to Jamestown, having in his train five subordinate chiefs, and bring- ing his annual tribute to King Charles. Upon this occasion he made " a long oration ' to Sir William Berkeley, in which he protested that "the sun and' moon should first lose their glorious lightsand shin- ing, before he or his people should evermlore hereafter wrong the English in any kind, but they would ever hold love and friendship together." A large measure of internal thrift was now the lot of the colony. The Indians seemed thoroughly indis- posed to cope with their powerful invaders, retired beyond the neighborhood of their settlements, and were forbidden by Necotowance, on pain of death, to appear within the English limits, unless sent by 29*     <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6802-00000176"/> 342   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. him as messengers. The colonists now numbered fifteen thousand,? and " of negroes three hundred good servants." They were visited usually by about thirty trading-vessels in a year, and in the preceding December there lay in their waters at one time twelve ships from England, twelve from Holland, and seven from New England. There were in the colony twenty thousand neat cattle, two hundred horses and mares, fifty asses, three thousand sheep, five thousand goats, and innumerable swine and poultry; hundreds of acres of wheat, plenty of barley, excellent malt, and six publike Brew-houses "; indigo, hemp, and flax; four wind-mills, five water-mills, many horse-mills, but no saw-mills; twenty churches:, and ministers to each whose livings were worth at least one hundred pounds per annum. The Governor, from half a bushel of rice, had raised fifteen, which he was intending to sow at the next season.  He had fifteen hundred fruit-trees, besides apricots, peaches, quinces, &amp;c. Captain Brocas had planted a vineyard, and ' mnade most excellent wine." Richard Bennet, from an or- chard of his own planting, " had made twenty Butts of excellent cider." For\ the last three or four years, Richard Kinsman had made forty or fifty butts of perry. But " worthy Captaine Matthews, an old Planter of above thirty years standing," seems to have been the prince of planters,- " hath. a fine house, sowes yeerly store of Hemp and Flax, and causes. it to be spun; keeps weavers, and hath a Tan House; causes leather to be dressed; hath eight shoemakers * "Perfect Description," p. 3.

There was also at this time "a Fr!ee-schoole with two hundred acres of land, a fine house upon it, forty milch kine." It was established " by Mr. Benjamin Symes, worthy to be chronicled."' The civil war in England, which had been raging since 1642, was closed by the execution 1649. of the king on the 30th of January, 1649. Virginia had no share in the strife. Her intercourse with Eng- land had, indeed, been much interrupted, and her trade hindered; still, as we have seen, her domestic condition was prosperous. The planters pursued their quiet labors without interruption, and waited with anxiety for the issue of the struggle in the mother country. But when, at length, the news arrived that the king was beheaded,-that British royalty was overthrown, - the Virginians did not acknowledge "' The Commonwealth." Their Assemrbly met in Oc- tober, and in their first act "expressed the profoundest veneration for the late king; denounced all aspersions upon his memory as treasonable; declared it treason to doubt the right of Prince Charles to succeed to the crown, or to propose a change of government in the colony, or to doubt the authority of the Governor or government." * Perfect Description of Virginia.    <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6802-00000177"/> 344   THE YOUTI OF THE OLD DOMNION. If this attachment to royalty seem inconsistent with the sturdy principles of self-government which Vir- ginia had so long cherished, it should be remembered that hithertho - oing, perhaps, to the embarrass- ments of the late monarch-her liberties had been untouched. Practically, she had been independent. Under the shadow of the throne, she had been un- molested, and had flourished. Why, then, should s-he repudiate a political relationship hitherto little more than nominal., and, for aught she had experi- enced, salutary? VVhy, especially, should she capri- ciously transfer allegiance from the venerable crown, which generations of her ancestors had honored, to a usurping power which had sprung up in a night and might perish in a day? Above all, why should she, like a fickle maiden, welcome a new lord:, who, where he pow had sway, spurned the Church in whose arlms she had been reared, - who overturned her al- tars and drave out her priesthood? Cromwell and the Commonwealth were for Puritanism; the Crown and Virginia were for Episcopacy. Such considerations may account for Virginia " being whol for monarchy." The loyal spirit of the colony was well kno-wn in England. Berkeley, "the honest Governor, (for no man meant better,) .... writ to the king," Charles II., "almost inviting him thither," and had received a new commission from the royal hand. Virginia was a house of refuge to the despairing Cava- liers; many persons of good condition, and ';good officers in the war," "nobility, clergy, and gentry," u' transported themselves thither, with all the ,estate they had been able to preserve." They were wel- comed by the people; and Sir William Berkeley /   VIRGINIA AND CROMWELAL.       345 "showed great respect to all the royal party who made that colony their refuge.  His house and purse were open to all that were so qualify'd."   Thus the element of loyalty was largely increased, both in measure and in fervor; for the harrowing tales of the refugees carried captive the sympathies of those who heard them. The  Parliament, in  October, 1650, took i650. measures to reduce the several colonies of England to the authority of the' Commonwealth. A fleet under Sir George Ayscue was despatched for this purpose to Barbadoes, Bermudla, and An. tigua. 'In September, 1651, Commissioners ' were appointed "to use   their best endeavors to165 reduce all the plantations within the Bay of the Chesepick to their due obedience." 'They embarked in the "Guinea Frigate,' one of " two or three ships" under the " command and conduct of Captain Robert Dennis."  They were instructed " to assure pardon and indemnity to all the Inhabitants of the said Plan- tations that shall submit unto the present Govern- ment.  And in case they shal not submit by fair wayes and meanes, you are to use all acts of hos- tility that lies in your power to enforce them." t ' "Captain Robert Dennis, Mr. Richard Bennel;, Mr. Thomas Steg, and Captain William Clairborn." f Clarendon, 788. Also, "IDuplicate Instructions" ' in the name and by order of the Council of State appointed by authority of Parlia- ment," signed "John Bradshaw, President." The paper is in the tract entitled "Virginia and Maryland," pp. 18 20, in Force, Vol. II. From these "Instructions " it would seem that' there were only two ships sent to Virginia, - the John " and the "Guinny Friggot "; but as they firsl joined Ayscue (so says Hildreth) in the West Indies, it is possible that    <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6802-00000178"/> 346    THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNIONe In March, 1652, Edmund     Curtis, With his colleagues, Bennet andti Clairborne, arrived at Jamestown, and summoned the colony to surrender. Their ships were "armed     and manned," having on board a regiment of seven hundred and fifty men. Berkeley had received    notice of their coming, and assumed  a posture of resistance; whether wVith the intent to repel the vessels by force of arms, or only by a show  of such intent to obtain honorable terms, does not appear.                       : There were several armed Dutch ships, merchant- men, then lying in the river at Jamestown.        By an ordinance of Parliament, their presence there rentdered they appeared in the Chesapeake with such additional force as properly to be called 'la squadron." The Instruct-l s are so explicit in requiring that Dennis slould al- ways join in the official acts of his associates, that the words "whereof Captain Robert:Dennis to be one" make a perpetual jingle through the entire instrument. "Edmund Curtis, commander of the Guinny Frigot," was empowered to act with the others as Commissioner, "in case of mortality, or absence of Captain Robert Dennis." Beverly and Campbell state that Dennis was with the Commissioners at Jamestown; but, as Hildreth (I. 356) states that he and Steg " suffered, shipwreck on their passage " thither, and as only the names of Curtis, Clairborne, and Bennett-niotwithstanding' the strict orders of the Council of State- were appended to the papers subscribed at Jamestown, it is right to sup- pose that Dennis did not arrive there. It was doubtless from policy that " two of the Commissioners were taken from among the planters themselves," Clairborne and Bennett, both apparently in England. when the Instructions were drawn, lhad been banished from Virginia by the Governor and Council (Campbell, 68), and were bitter in their feelings toward the colonial. government, -fit agents for the Commonwealth. Besides, Bennett at least was a Round- head. In this view, we cannot say much about the " true magnanimity " which suggested their appointment. See Bancroft, I. 222b. The ships had on board a hundred and fifty Scotch prisoners of war, sent to Virginia to be sold as servants. H[ildreth, I. 356.

They were promptly brought broadside-to to the ships of the Commnonwealth, and their decks \Were efficiently reinforced by colonists. Several pieces of ordnance supported them from the shore, the height;s of which were thronged with experienced soldiers. Receiving at once a refusal of their summons, and seeing these formidable preparations, the Commis- sioners stood aloof. Communications, under flags of truce, -were opened by them with the colonial authori- ties, and under the shadow of these flags not only was the business of state conductedl, but a very free, and even fraternal, intercourse was sustained between the Parliament forces and the people on' shore. But there was another potent agency also at work for a peaceful accommodation.  The "John " and the 1' Guinny  Frigot" had valuable property on board belonging tlo two members of the Colonial Council. The Commissioners whispered this in the ears of the owners, who saw at once that they swould be richer or poorer, as they should promote or hinder the design of Parliament. Thus Mammon, always a great politician and diplomatist, had a voice in the deliberations of the Council. His sly pleadings raised a division there; and although in this instance they would not have prevailed alone, yet they first, and then the grave argument that resistance would prove bloodshed in vain, led to honorable terms of capitu- lation. These terms were dictated by the General Assembly themselves, and were sent to Curtis '4 ac- companied by a solemn declaration that, unless they were acceded to inl the most ABSOLU:E and LITEMRA]L    <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6802-00000179"/> 348   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. SENSE, without alteration or qualification, the colo- nists were ready to suffer the last extremities rather than submit."   They were " acceded to." The colony recognized the authority of the Eng- lish Commonwealth, and received guaranties in re- turn. It was stipulated, first of all, that this sub- mission be acknowledged a VOLUNTARY ACT ; not forced nor constrained by a conquest upon the coun- try, and that they shall have and elljoy such freedoms and privileges as belong to the free-born people of England."  They were then assured of full indem- nity; of the right of Assemblies as formerly; of free trade as the people of England do enjoy; of freedom from all taxes except by consent of the Assembly; of the security of land grants ; and of the use of the Book of Common Prayer for one year t   The safety of the Dutch allies and the Cavaliers was also pro- vided for.4 By other and separate articles of agreement be- tween the Commissioners and the Council, suitable and generous provision was made to insure the Gov- ernor and Council from harm or annoyance in their persons and estates, for one year, and within the bounds of Virginia. Such, in substance, were the terms on which Vir- ginia acknowledged the authority of the English Commonwealth;, terms by which all her former privi- Burk II. 85. t Notwithstanding these express 'words in the Instructions: "You' shall cause to be received and published the Acts [of Parliament] for abolishing the Book of Common Prayer." t By Articles X. and XIV., and particularly by Article IX. in the agreement with the Council.

The  commissions of the     Governor and    Council were of course void, and "the     Commissioners, with the advice of the Assembly, administered the govern- ment according to former precedents," until regular appointments   of Governor and    Council should    be made by the Council of State in England. A "There no sooner appeared two or three ships from the Parliament, than all thoughts of resistance were laid aside." Clarendon, p. 788. "Clarendon states the matter rightly.

There are two questions respecting this transaction. 1. Was there, or wasathemr not, any show of armed resistance? 2. 'Were, or were not, Dutch merchantmen trading with the colony at the time? Whatever " contemporary writers," or others, may be cited to sustain a negative answer to these questions, I humbly conceive that none are of authority so reliable as the very Articles of Capitulation, and the very Act of Indemnity, signed by the Commissioners then and there. These are now before me, in Burk, II. 85 - 90. On the first question. "The act of indemnitie made att the surrender of the countrey ' has these words in its preamble: ' Finding force raised by the Governour and countrey to make opposition. against the said fleete, whereby assured danger appearinge of the ruine and destruction of the plantation, for prevention whereof the burgesses of all the several plantations being called to advise and assist therein, uppon long and serious debate, and in sad contemplation -of the great miseries and cer- taine f(estruction which were so neerely hovering over the whole coun- trey," &amp;ce. We find here evidence, to us conclusive, cf a show of. resist- ance,--of very serious resistance,--of a resisting attitude of sufficient duration to admit of " long and serious debate." On the second question. To say nothing of the -statements of Gra- hame, Hildreth, Campbell, and Beverly, and without insisting upon the fact that Burk, when he says several Dutch ships were lying off James- town," appeals to "Ancient Records," I will give the "Fourteenthly"' of the articles agreed upon between the Commissioners and the Grand 30    <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6802-00000180"/> 350    THE YOUTH   OF THE OLD DOMNION. On the 30th of April, the Commissioners, jointly with the House of Burgesses, organized a provisional government " for a year, or until the pleasure of the Council of State [in England] should be known."' Their executive officers were Richard Bennett, Gov- ernor, William   Clairborne, Secretary, and a Council, whom   they invested with   only  " such powers and authorities, and to act from    time to time as by the Assembly: ' That all goods alreadie brought hither by the Dutch and others which are now on shoar shall be free from surprizall." The Dutch merchantmen had put their goods on shore for safety; perhaps purposely, that they might, unsuspected by the Commissioners, be. included in this very articleof agreement. These copies of original documents- we cannot suppose them to be forgeries - are of paramount authority, and hardly justify the, opinion that " the account of Beverly " - folloved, too, by that of Burk, on the testimony of records -- "is in itself improbable." Beverly, to be sure, "Iyrote in the next century"; but the Commissioners, on the 12th of March, 1652..  Dutch merchantmen, knowing' well their exposure to seizure by the ships of Parliament, "were careful to guard against the worst, by mounting cannon, and by a sufficient supply of small arms and am- munition." (Burk, II. 82.)                      v 4 But would the colonists engage in a trade which the laws of England declared, and treated, as contraband I They did. [Even in the next. year, they not only claimed the right of free trade, but they even found- ed that right both on the Articles of Capitulation and on the Parliament's previous Act of Navigation itself, however sophistical their reasoning from such. premises may have been. But more. They were so strenu- ous, sensitive, and jealous on this subject, that one Abrahara Read was arraigned and tried for saying "that no foreigners ought to have trade in Virginia, which is contrary to an Act of Parliament, and the articles granted upon the surrender of the colony." The' colonists certainly acted on the opinion that they had, and had had, the right to trade with foreigners. Burk, II. 96. The truth concerning this memorable transaction is of importance, as showing the chivalry of the Virginians, and their determinationto sub- mit to no imposition, to no dishonor, and to alienate none of their cher- ished rights as freemen.   VIRGINIA AND 'CROMWELL.       351 Grand Assembly shall be appointed and granted to their several places respectively for' the time afore- said." It was also declared, that all the officers of the colony should be appointed by the ::Burgesses. "It had been usual for the Governor and Council to sit in the Assembly; the expediency of the meas- ure was questioned, and a temporary compromise en- sued; they retained their former right, but were. re- quired to take the oath which was administered to the Burgesses," which was, "to act with the best of your judgment and advice for the public good, not min- gling with it any particular of private interest.'? And although the Assembly of 1654 were in- duced, for some reason, to restrict the right of 1654. suflfriage -hitherto conceded to all tax-payers -- to those who had a certain qualification in real or per- sonal estate, yet in 1656, by an act of repeal, they replaced the right on its. former demo- 1656. cratic basis, because "it is something hard and un- agreeable to reason that any person shall pay equal taxes and yet have no vote in elections." - In 1658, the Assembly created other safe- guards to their liberties. On the 13th of M1arch, 16 they "themselves " elected as Governor the man "who kept a good house, lived bravely, and was a true lover * "The payment of taxes was almost the sole qualification."--Burk, I. 303, note. "Every titheable or taxable inhabitant was an essential part of the sovereignty, and voted for members of the Assembly." - Ibid. 314.  1  Burk, II. 08; Campbell, 72. This was done under Edward Digges as Governor, who had been elected the year before, 1655, "by the As- sembly. itself," - Bancroft, I. 226, - i. e., without the Commissioners of Parliament, who were elsewhere occupied.    <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6802-00000181"/> 352   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNINION. of Virginia" '; and immediately saw fit to rescind the " temporary compromise" of 1652; by which act they denied the Governor and Council the right of sitting with the Burgesses;, - thus constitutiig themselves a separate and independenlt department of the Lecgisla- tive. .,This the ";worthy Captaine Matthews" re- sented. He therefore issued a message, on the 1st of April, declaring the Assembly dissolved. .The Bur- gesses denied his right to do so, and requested him to retract; and, in secret session, bound themselves by oath not to submit to an act so arbitrary. The Governor yielded, revoking the order of dissolution, but said that he shlould' refer to Cromwell the question of his disputed riglht. The Assembly, jealous lest one such reference should prove a precedent by which their legislative proceedings in future should[ become en- tangled and complicated., and their, liberties abridged, immediately and solemnly drew up and passed a dec- laration, that they were an independent body; that no power in Virginia but their' own could dissolve them; that, as representatives of the people, they were the sovereign power; and that they -who, as -such, had the power to make, had also the power to unmake.  To illustrate their doctrine, they, imme- diately deposed the Governor and Council. But to show that they did so from regard to a principle, and not from. personal pique, they immediately re-elected him, and offered to invest him.

Thus rigidly did Virginia adhere to the true doc- trines of free government, and thus boldly did she proclaim them; at different times, from 1652 to 1658, limiting the powers of the Executive, declaring that t'he people, by their representatives, should be elect- ors of all officers, that taxation gives suffrage, that the popular, branch of the Legislature should be a dis- tinct body, that it existed by tLe act; of the people and not by executive sufferance, and that magistr;:es are not the people's masters, but their servants. In other words, the Virginians proclaimed and expounded the grand democratic doctrine, that The Sovereign of the State is TIIE PEOPLE.

But Sir William's departure had been prevented, and he was therefore liable to arrest. To prevent this, the Assembly, in 1653, had passed a special act permit- ting him to remain eight months longer, And in 1656 his continued residence had been again sanc- tioned by an act of Assembly. Thus, under one pre- text and another, his residence in Virginia appears to have been uninterrupted. On the 22d 'of April, 1659, Richard Cromwell's power came {o-an end, and soon after ill that year he resigned his office. Governor Matthews had deceased when the Virginia Assembly next met, on the 13th of March, 1660. They immediately passed an act, de- claring that, as there was ( noe resident absolute and generall confessed power in England," therefore the supreme government of the colony should vest in the Assembly. Their next act was the 'election of Sir William Berkeley as Governor, restricting him from dissolving the Assembly without their consent. When the office was offered to him, he said in reply: "I doe therefore, in the presence of God and you, make this safe protestation for us all, that if any suprea-me set- tled power appeares, I will i:mmediately lay down my commission, but wrill live most submissively obedient to any power God shall set over me, as the experience of eight years have shewed I have done." There was no recognition of Charles II. in any of ttle acts of this Assembly; nor was there in an official letter of the Governor dated the 20th of August next, nearly three months after Charles II. had ascended the' throne, though before the event was 'knovn in Virginlia.* : Campbell, 73, 74, 78.   VIRGINIA AND CROMWELL.     355 In March, 1661, Berkeley received a new royal commission' as Governor, dated July 31st, ]661 1660. Thus quietly did Virginia pass fiorn the Crown to the Commonw ealth, and again from. the Common- 'wealth to the Crown; for the Assembly of this year - consisting, however, mainly-of new members, and probably the new were royalists--sent a loyal ad- dress to the king.    <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6802-00000183"/> CHAPTER,    XXII. FRONTIER LIFE. 165  FOR fourteen successive years Virginia had been governed by Sir Williamr Berkeley in the name of King Charles II. During this time the pop- ulation had greatly increased; and, to .a superficial observer, the colony had every sign of prosperity and content. For the most part,the administration of the Governor had been unexceptionable, and had been rewarded by the esteem and affection of the people at large. He had been with them thirty-five years, nearly all of which time he had ]been their chief magis- trate, distinguished alike for his public spirit, his high principle, his amiable manners, and his generosity. He had devoted the strength of his days, and a large portion of his private estate, Ito promote the interests of the colony. In addition tAo his salary of 61,000 allowed by the Crown, the Assembly, in 1767, had voted him 200 per annum, and for life, as some compensation for his losses under the' Common- wealth. In 1671, according to his statement made to the Lords of the Commissioners of Colonies, the people of Virginia numbered forty thousand, of which two thousand were negro slaves, and six thousand white indented servants. They could muster for military service eight thousand cavalry; had two forts on the   FRONTIER LIFE.        357 James River, and one on each of the rivers Rappa- hannock, York, and Potomac. They had thirty can- non; and received into their ample waters eighty ves- sels yearly from England and Ireland, which came for tobacco, besides a few small vessels from New Eng- land. In compliance with instructions from the king, an attempt had been made to establish towns as ports of entry; and in 1662 seventeen new houses had been added to the hitherto insignificant village of James- -'towrn. Of these, one was built by the Governor him- self; a few, by members of the Council; others, by planters and traders, and at the expense of the counties.* For a while, the place had been the scene of consider- able bustle. But this impulse, being' from constrained and artificial means, and contrary to the genius of the people and the natural currents of trade, was but tem- porary; and Jamestown, for a long time, was but a cluster of thirty-two brick houses, most of which had been converted into taverns and hucksters' shops. Until 1664, the Quarter Courts, and even the Assem- bly, had met in taverns. But at that time it was re- solved to purchase a house for the use. of the courts, and to build a State-House for the Assembly. But Jamestown was no specimen of Virginia. The thousands of her people were scattered thinly all along upon the banks of her noble rivers and her beau- tiful creeks. The planter seated himself, wherever he "- could effect a title, upon the rich bottom-lands, but x The settled territory of Virginia had been divided, in 1634, into eight shires or counties; in 1642, three had been added; in 1652, four; in 1653, one. In 1666, there were nineteen; in 1670, there were twenty.

The Virginia plantation asually extended back foomn the river's shore about an English mile; and. along the shore a half-mile, or )ne, two, three -miles, and sometimes more. Thus ?lantations of a thousand or two thousand acres, and wen more, were not uncommon; for the Virginian lad a passion for real estate, and the -bounty of fifty rcres to the transporter for every resident whom any )ne should transport from England, rendered the ac- luisition comparatively easy to settlers who could pay he trifling passage-money of servants. Thus situ- tted, the planters were necessarily scattered, seldom neeting except upon public occasions, and caring for ittle else than the visit of the trading-ship at their loors, and a fair exchange for their tobacco. It was rery natural, in a country rwatered by rivers some of vhich were navigable for a hundred miles, that its produce should be sought by the merchant, rather than hat the producer should transport it to stated and listant marts in the colony. 'The ship which entered he Chesapeake for tobacco must be laden for traffic. She must ascend the rivers. She must pass along rom plantation to plantation, bartering her miscella- Leous cargo for the staple of the country.' Thus the kipper on the Jamles or the Potomac, 'carrying all orts of truck, could at the best drive, in. the way of rade, only a sort of Scotch peddling't; while the plant- r, from his low-roofed but commodious dwelling, urrounded by this flocks grazing, Whislking, and kipping in his sight," looked out from. his door-way r his "shuttered' window upon the "delightfull"   FRONTIER LIFE.       359 river before him, and only waited for the coming of the supercargo, whom lie welcomed to his home, his table, his pipe, and his storehouse. It is e asy to perceive, there:[ore, why Virginia had no towns, and why all the instructions of the king, and all the orders of the Council, and all the bounties offered by the Assembly, could not make it otherwise. But there were hinderances to the general ease and content. Notwithstanding his many acres, his rich soil, his supply of 'servants, and his abundant crops, the Virginia planter of 1675 did not thrive. There had been a wise attempt on the part of the Assembly, in 1667, to establish manufactures, particularly of cloth. But the zeal in their behalf hadl subsided, and. after a little while, had become comparatively fruit- less. -There were no manfacturing operations in Vir- ginia worthy of account. For his simple utensils, the planter might rely upon his own unpractised handi- craft ; but for his more important ones, for his house- holdl goods, and for almost all his clothing, he must look to the market of Europe. His entire crop of to- bacco was scarcely sufficient to provide clothing for his dependents. "His sheep"  -if he had any-- ' yielded good increase, and bore good fleeces; but-- be sheared them on7ly to cool them.' VThile producing abundance, he was impoverished. With all his wealth, he was poor.  The paradox   is .easily explained: planters sheared sheep to cool. them; government sheared planters to heat them. This our narrative will show. In the year 1675, Stafford was the upmost or fron-, tier county on the Potomac.

They were neighbors, - which, in those days, meant that they did not live very many miles apart, -- and had fallen in with each, other, by a sort of tacit appointment, on their ways to their little rustic church, embowered by itself far from any one plantation, " though placed in the middest of them."   In this remote district, it was very seldom that public worship could be held ; for there were but about fifty parishes in Virginia, and    " not above a fifth part of them  were supplied with ministers."'  Glad to improve so rare an. opportunity, the party had been freely   gossiping about their domestic ex- perience and prospects, when one of them      very inno- cently gave a turn to their discourse, by a somewhat scrutinizing survey of the garments of a companion who  had but just joined them.     He did it by   no means impertinently, but it was noticed. ' Brandon! I am    a sorry-looking fellow, for one * Virginia's Cure, 4. Campbell, 79. Sir William Berkeley, Writing in 1670 or 1671, said: "Our ministers are well paid, and by my consent should be better, if they would pray oftener and preach less. But as of all other commodities, so of this, the worst are sent to us." (Campbell, 79.) The old. Cavalier disliked popular education, and a preaching ministry as an auxiliary to it. Yet it is not improbable that the clergy of Vir- ginia used their pulpits politically, and perhaps some of them were of "the worst." IIammond, in his "Leah and Rachel," printed in 1656, said that - previously, to be sure --"Virginia savouring not handsome- ly in England, very few Gospel Ministers would adventure thither. Yet many came, such as wore Black Coats, and could babble in a Pulpit-, roare in a Tavern, exact from their Parishioners, and rather by their dissolutenesse destroythan feed their Flocks." And added, "Oh! that God would stir up the hearts of more to go over, such as would teach good doctrine, and not paddle infaction or state matters!" (pp. 9, 20.)

I was inspecting your Sunday dress, to be sure.; but it was thoughtlessly, and yet thoughtfully. I mean, I was not conscious of an act which might seem impertinent, ald yet your garments set me a thinking. But what did you mean by saying, ' nor his fault'?" "I meant that the Lord has given me land enough, and cattle, and servants, and as brave a wife as ever came to Virginia woods; how, then, can I lay a threadbare coat to his charge?" "I know, I know," replied the other sharply; "you 're robbed; we 're all robbed." "Lawfully, though." ' Legally, not lawfully." ' Well, well," replied Bailey, "lawfully is by law, and legally is by law. But robbery is robbery after all." ' What do you mean?" inquired Thomas Hope, another of the neighbors. ' You talk. .about robbery and law-robbing. All I know is, that we can get nothing for our tobacco, and so we are poor. But no man robs us." ' Heavens! don't you know, Hope, what the Navi- gation Law is?" inquired Bailey. "Navigation Law! No.  But I know what the Navigation Act is. I 've heard o' tlhal." His companions laughed at their neighbor's igno- rance; but Bailey replied indifferently: ' Well, sir, the Navigation Act is the Navigation Law." ' Oh! is it? And what has the Navigation Act to do with robbing, pray?" 81    <pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6802-00000186"/> 362   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. "Did you not say," asked Brandon, ' that you know what the Navigation Act is?? Yes." What is it? "Why, it 's the law about sailing ships; and I say I don't see what ship-sailing has to do with robbing." "Upon my word," rejoined Bailey, "' you must have kept away from folks a great while, if you have n't heard how the Navigation Act robs you." "I 've been among folks some, - to the County Courts, and once I went to Quarter Court to James- town, and seed Sir William in his grand dress a- horseback.. So you need n't think I have n't been among folls. And I 've heard a deal said, in a kind o'a swearin' way, about the Navigation Act; but somehow I never could see what a planter like me, up here in the woods, has to' do with navigation." "Did you never ask, Hope?" inquired Brandon, who really felt sorry for his neighbor's heedless igno- rance. "No. I don't have nothin' to do with ships, only when one comes up the river for tobacco. What should I ask for?" "Suppose you ask now." "Well,' said the other, good-humoredly, I 'll ask. What has the Navigation Act to do with me, or with robbing folks?" "What do you get for your crop?" "About three happence. Maybe sometimes, for very good, tuppence." "And why don't you get threepence, fourpence, sixpence?" "My soul! if I did, I never should get to heaven,   FRONTIER LIFE.      863 I should be so rich; for a rich man can't get into the kingdom. The Lord preserve me from sixpence a pound!" "Don't deceive yourself, Hope," said Brandon, laughing. "'Don't deceive yourself with Puritan cant On the way to church. If sixpence a pound were offered you, I fear me you 'd forget about the kingdom of heaven." Maybe, maybe. I only said, c The Lord preserve me.' Well, Brandon, thrippence, fuppence, sixpence, -why don't I get it?" It 's time you should know, Hope. The Naviga- tion Act says that the man who buys your tobacco shall not carry it anywhere but to England." "All right. Old England ought to have it." "But if Old Elgland has all that grows in Vir- ginia, she has more than she wants." "Then let 'em carry it somewhere else.' "Right, neighbor; you 're right there. You have hit the nail on the head; and so has the Navigation Act, for it says they sha' n't carry it anywhere else." Sha' n't!" "Exactly, - sha' n't. And so, you see, if there is ten times as much Virginia tobacco in England as is wanted there, and if the law won't let them sell it anywhere else, then the law touches your tobacco crop, and your pocket." "Yes, yes, I see. Because they can't sell it." No. They sell it, but they get so little for it that they can give you but little." "So that 's the law, is it? that's the Navigation Act?" j"A part of it.", A        .-r ofit,    <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6802-00000187"/> 364   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. "And what 's t' other part;? 9 "There are two other parts. One is, that if the ships could carry your crop to France or Holland, you would get twice, or three or four times, as much for it. And the other is, that the ships shall not bring you a plough, or a spade, or a p)air of shears, or a piece of cloth, unless they are made in England." "An't that a good law? Faith! I don't wnt zmy things from anywhere else. The English can beat the French, and Dutch, and all, a makin' 'em, any day. Where can we get so good as in good Old England? - God bless her! ' Brandon was determined that. Hope should under- stand a matter so important, and patiently proceeded to instruct him. I 'll give you the whole in a nut-shell. You take a cargo of tobacco. You must carry it to England. 'Sir,' you say, ' will you buy my tobacco?' 'No, no, Mr. Hope. I have too much on hand already. I don't want it.' ' Very well, Mr. Londoner, I 'll just take it over to Holland.' The man grins, and you go away. But just then Mr. Navigation Act comes along, and says: 'Take care, Hope! If you take a pound to Holland, I 'll trounce you!' Now it would be a queer thing for little Mr. Hope to set himself up in a tussle with the British Lion. So he scratches his head to think; and being made all of a tremble by just the hint of good Old England's wrath, he comes back, and says: ' Mr. Londoner, please take my to- bacco. Mr. Navigation Act says I must n't take it to Holland.' So, so, Mr. Hope! exactly so. Well, to accommodate you, I 'll take it for so much.' 'That 's a ruinous price for a planter, Mr. Lon- ,\                        .   FRONTIER LIFE.         365 doner!'  ' Can't help it, Mr. Hope; sorry for you, but can't give more.' So you make your bargain at a ruinous price. But you have n't got; through with Mr. Navigation Act yet.  You want cloth and other thiings to bring back; not money.   You go about, jingling it in your pocket, to buy. 'But, Mr. Clothier, Mr. Brazier, Mr. Cordwainer, Mr. Cutler, these are ruinous prices for a Virginia planter!' ' Can't help it, Mr. Hope; we hardly make a penny,' the liars! 4 Well, gentlemen, I can't. afford it.  Mounseer or Mynheer can do better by me.'    Then comes Mr. Navigation Act again, with his cudgel ' Take care, Mr. Hope, how   you take French goods, or Dutch goods, or any other than English goods, into Vir- ginia.' And so my good friend Hope sneaks back, and says: ' Gentlemen, I can't help myself; I must have your goods, and I must take them     at your prices.' So you trade; the ruinous price of the buyer to sell for, and the ruinous, price of the seller to buy for.  And between them   both, poor Planter Hope is pretty well fleeced, and brings back ruinous little for his crop. Now you don't go. yourself; but that is just the way, my friend, that our tobacco, which we must sell, is sold; and just the way our goods, which we must have, are bought.   The Navi- gation Act was made for London purses, for London extortioners, and we are at their mercy, - that 's all.* * The English Navigation Act reached its climax of severity in 1663. It had its origin in a measure adopted by the Long Parliament for bring- ing the colonies into subjection, and for ruining the commerce of the Dutch. This was the nucleus. This famous act was not a Stuart measure, nor Cromwellian, nor Hanoverian. It was national. It was English. England, ever supremely selfish, and in her selfishness insane, held it as an axiom, that Englishmen of full blood became vulgarized4 31*    <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6802-00000188"/> 366   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. So you understand what makes my neighbor Bailey here wear such a coat on Sunday." Thunder!" and the frontier man stood agape. "What!" "Is that the Navigation Act?" "That is the Navigation Act, which you 've heard folks 'kind o' swearin' about.'" 'Fore George! it cuts both ways!" "Does it?" asked Brandon, sarcastically. "Well," innocently replied Hope, " we Lmust tell the Governor to get a better law." "Easier said than done!" muttered Bailey, with bitterness. ' But I 'm sure Sir William will do what he can to help us, and he 's a great man with the king," "Better for you to let the Navigation Act be as it is, neighbor," said Brandon. "Better!" exclaimed Hope, puzzled by Brandon's apparent versatility. "Yes." "What do you mean?   Just now you was saying that-" "Hold, friend!

FRONTIER LIFE.        367 The three had fallen a little in the rear of their companions, but were now arrested in their progress by the halt of the others, who blocked up the narrow footpath. Perceiving a look of inquiry in their faces, Brandon suspended his sentence, and asked what was the matter. "It 's Robert Hen's house," replied one. "We are wondering that he has not come out. He 's going to church, I know ; for he 'd be on his way to Northum- berland County.  He 's going to be herdsman to a planter there." Robert Hen had been a servant, but had worked out his indentures with credit to himself. His mas- ter, as was customary with the planters, had allowed him a little patch of ground for his own behoof. This he had patiently cultivated during the years of his service, in those hours of ordinary days, and on Saturday afternoons, when the custom of the country did not exact labor for the master. Year after year, he had raised his little parcel of tobacco, and carefully husbanded or invested its proceeds. A breeding pig and a heifer, which had freely herded with his mas- ter',s; had prettily increased; so that he had a little live stock and a few farming tools to. begin life with on his own account. Besides, there was a buxom dairy-maid on his master's plantation who had not said, "No" ; and her time of service was nearly out. So honest Robert had just taken up,* as by law he had a right to do, an unpatented lot of fifty acres by $ The enormous grants to Culpepper and Arlington - of which more 'hereafter- could not prevent new occupations of land by resolute men. Besides, at this date, the transaction was not universally known among the frontier-men, or at best was vaguely understood.    <pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6802-00000189"/> 368   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. the river, and had built for himself-* and Susan - a snug log cottage. Just now, he had an opportunity to turn his time to good profit by serving Mr. T. M.,-nobody knows anything 'of his name but its initials. So he had arranged to leave the trifling affairs ,of his cabin in charge of a young lad, until Susan and the parson should be ready; when his master was to present him-as was usual upon a servant's discharge - with ten bushels of corn, two new suits of clothes, and a gun. The rude chimney and the ridge of his, house were but just discernible by the party through the branches of the trees. After a little silent waiting, one of them gave a loud halloo. But the call died away in the forest without an answer. "I will go and find him," said Brandon ; and he immediately advanced through the trees in the di- rection of the cottage. In a few moments his call was heard, in tones of such distress and terror, that every man started instantly, and with rushing speed. They found Brandon in the door-way of the humble dwelling, on one knee, and supporting against his shoulder the mangled and ghastly body of Robert Hen. An Indian lay dead upon the threshold, and both were shockingly wounded on their heads, arms, and other parts of their persons. "There is life in him yet," said Brandon; " let us save him if we can.'" Some attempt was made to revive the dying man, but it was too late. Robert's eyes were fast glazing. He seemed conscious, however, that friends were pres- ent, for he slightly pressed the hand of-Brandon. "Robert! Robert!" he exclaimed, "who has done this?"    FRONTIER LIFE.      369 The man made two or three ineffectual attempts to reply; but at last he articulated in a whisper,'"Doegs! Doegs!" and expired. This was the name of a tribe, or small family, of Indians in the neighboring county of Northumberland. A noise from the interior of the house now startled the party. Brandon dropped the corpse, which he was still upporting, and sprang to his feet, while all receded a few steps from the door, where they stood together, waiting resolutely, though unarmed. The ailarm, however, rwas but for a momentl, for there ap- peared only-the lad with whom poor Robert was to have placed in charge his little home. He was pale as ashes; and no sooner did he perceive the group without, thans he leaped frantically over the dead bodies before him, and sank fainting on the ground. As soon as he recovered, he informed the party that he had been woke about daybreak by an outcry from Robert, whom he found standing ins the door-way, defending himself with a hatchet against a number of Indians, one of whom was lying almost lifeless at his feet; that he had hidden himself beneath the bed, where he had remained half dead with terror, until: he heard the-voices of Brandon and his com- panions.' The death of Opechancanough had proved the death of the Powhattan confederacy. The thirty tribes, severed, dispersed, and conscious of their weakness, had usually remained quiet upon their new fields and hunting-grounds without annoyance to the English. Soa long had this continued, that the * T.

Some depredations had been committed upon the property of the border set- tlements, but the resident Indians *had disavowed all share therein, and their disavow al had been sat- isfactory. The murder of Robert Hen was the first shedding of English bloodl which had occurred for many years, and, as we shall see, it had important results. Great, therefore, was the commotion' at the little church in the woods, when his mangled corpse, brought thither on a rude litter, was laid before the chancel. But no sooner had the rustic congregation heard the manner in which one of their number -a favorite with all who knew him - had met his death, than their consternation gave place to wrath. It was with difficulty that they could be restrained within the bounds of decorum during the solemn service for the dead; but when they came to commit dust to dust, and thought of the wreck of manliness and manly hope which had been wrought, and witnessed the dumb and stony agony of the orphan who stood there in a strange land beside the grave of her be- trothed,--they swore. Not noisily, not wildly, but in those stern, subdued tones which belong to strong men resolute, they swore to avenge t]he blood of Rob- ert and the breaking heart of the maiden. They kept their oath. Intelligence of the tragedy had in the mean time been sent to Colonel Mason and Captain Brent, who \   FRONTIER LIFE.           371 lived a few  miles down the river.    The news spread rapidly.  The hardy planters rallied; and soon Mason and Brent, with a small body of men under their com- mand, sped upon the trail of the murderers.        After passing  twenty  miles up   the river, and four miles across it within   the bounds of Maryland, the party under Brent attacked a cabin occupied by the Doeg Indianls, and slew the chief and ten of his men.     Those under Mason were doing the work of revenge al; an- other  cabin, a  little way off.   Having   slaughtered fourteen, the Colonel, to his great consternation and. grief, found that he was assailing a party of Susque- hannah Indians, who were friendly to the Virginians.

The Dutch had long sustained a valuable traffic in furs with the Indians living at the head of the Chesa- peake Bay, who used yearly to pass southward to hunt and to purchase Plains, ranging in their course along the western frontier of Virginia. 'The English traders, who' had occupied New York most of the time for ten years ]before its cession, covetous of the valuable fur-trade, and reckless of the laws of frater- nity, had inspired these Indians first with jealousy, and then with hatred, towards the Virginians, who had shared in the benefits of the tra:ffic. The depre- dations upon border property which have been men- tioned had been committed probably by these travel- ling parties. But they were now roused to more se- rious aggressions, and began to spill blood both in Virginia and in Maryland as they passed to and fro; and soon after the affair of lMason and Brent -- doubt- less a provoking cause--raurders became frequent. The Indians who were in treaty with Virginia had not given notice of the approach of these enemies, nor had they done anything to deter thllem, as by treaty they were bound to do. This roused. the jealousy of the whites, who, under the excitement caused by the assassinations of their neighbors, and without suffi- cient evidence, were led to adjudge the friendly tribes as accomplices, and were ready to fall upon themn upon the least pretence. The Marylanders had al- ready engaged in open hostilities with the Piscataway Indians and with the Susquehannahs, both of them tribes at peace with Virginia. The latter, driven from their homes by the Senecas, had sought shelter in a fort of the Piscataways, near the head of the Poto-    FRONTIER LIFE  .      373 mac." This fort was besieged by the Marylanders not long after the murder of Robert Hen and the action of Mason and Brent. ' It stood on a low, swampy spot, its walls consisting of.. high banks of earth. At each angle was an abutment furnished with ]loopholes, and commanding all approach upon the. entire line of each diverging wall. At the base, and around the whole, fort, was a ditch, broad, deep, and filled with watoer. Without this ditch was a strong palisade formed of young trees from  five to eight inches in diameter, sunk some three feet or more in the earth, and about eight or tenl feet in height. Through apertures in this palisade, the Indians could do execution upon any assailants, as well as through those in the abut- ments. An approaching party must, therefore, sustain a fire directly in front, and, when at the foot of the palisades, could lbe raked on either flank. The strength of the structure itself, the insecure, boggy footing without, and the facilities for defensive operations, forbade all hope of carryingit by storm, except at great loss t The Maryland infantry, having no cannon, had undertaken to reduce it by siege. The Indians before long had become straitened for food, iand had con- trived to evade the careless sentries of the English so often, as to havestolen away and devoured nearly all the horses of those who had ridden thither. Besides, they had made so frequent sallies, and with such spirit,' that scarce a day passed when their besiegers did not seriously suffer.  Under these circumstances, the $ T.

Marylanders sent to Virginia for a reinforcement. A body of men was according sent, under command of Colonel John W'ashington.'    When these arrived, the Indians had begun to be seriously pinched for want of food, and were also- disturbed by seeing their professed friends sit down in league with their ene- mies.  Both of these circumstances inclined them      f to confer with the English for peace ; and on this     i errand they sent out sixft of their chief men. These were immediately seized' by the '" two commanders,"     J and put to death. This unaccountable treatment of    ! an embassy for peace roused the fainting Indians to  - desperate fury. They made fierce alnd bloody sallies,   ;, and when offered parley gave. no other answer than "( Wherere e our great men?"  "At the end of six weeks - from the commencement of the siege? - the remaining Indians, being seventy-five warri6rs, be- sides women, and. children, having destroyed every- thing within the fort which. could be of value, slipped' through the lines of their enemies " in the darke "; : as they passed, knocking out the brains of ten Eng- lishmen, whom they found asleep.

Thle whites were attacked in their fields by day, in their dwellings by night, or captured by ambuscades as they -ventured th    he forests. Soln, not a day passed without bloodshed.' The border planters were terrified ; not only because they found themselves attacked suddenly by a resolute and stealthy enemy, but by one who seemed even unusually stimulated to cruelty. Wh]ite men, in un- guarded moments, were captured- by the prowling savages, taken before the doors of their lonely cabins; one by one, the nails were torn from their hands and feet; one by one, their teeth were wrenched from their jaws ; their eyes were rooted from their sockets; and slowly, little by little, from crown to heel, the skin of each helpless victim was peeled frora the bounding    <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6802-00000193"/> 376   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION, flesh. If then the heart still beat, he was left to die.'  Such a warfare was horrible. And when, as they often did, the English scouts discovered such a corpse where they went to find a living friend, the most sturdy and iron-nerved men would pale and sicken. The Virgilnians v-ere appalled. Many of -the more exposed plantations were strewed with the dead, or deserted by the living. Seldom was a cabin burned '  i or a crop destroyed. The Indians seemed bent only i, upon death.' The people were compelled, for mutual safety, to crowd together, l- two, three, four families I in a house, which they would fortify as well as they : were able. No man crossed the threshold without his  gun. They tilled their several fields in bands, going  first to one, then to another;, their -veapons by their : sides, and their- sentinels around theram f   ; Of coursej information of these atrocities -was sent, to Jamestown, and the aid of the Governor was im- plored. The messages were answered by promises.  Sir William had, indeed, sent Sir Henry Chichely,   : the Lieutenant'Governor, a gainst the Indians, with  ' five hundred men; but he had also, mysteriously and :suddenly, recalled them in 'the midst -of their march. . By his order also, or at least -with his approbation, eight rude forts were constructed and manned along   ' the border, which the Indians laughed at. A Body of  i rangers would have proved protective, but stationary  I  forces were easily evaded. Instead of being ai benefit . to the planters by making them safer or quieteri they : j were a new evil. The Indians levied upon their lives ! * Burwell Narrative, 7.  t T. M., 10. l   FRONTIER LIFE. ,      3" none the less; the garrisons levied upon their scanty property the more. The people petitioned. for their removal., But no. A British governor-royal could not have erred in judgment! Or, if he had, it would be derogatory to his station to acknowledge it; doubly so, to undo a deed tio please the vulgar or spare their purse. So had the favorite of the people changed, -and so had their condition changed, since thirteen. years ago! Now he was their lord. The people became indignant; not the people upon the belt of country along the river-heads only, but the whole people,--for the blood of' the: Virginian in Jamestown or Accotnac boiled within him when he heard that the blood of the borderer;was shed, - andl he was yet more excited when it was said, The bor- derer is unaided and oppressed." If one member suffered, all the meembers suffered with it. With lit- tie exception, there wTas but one heart in Virginia, - and it ached. But border wair was not her only affliction. In 1669, the king had made a grant to Lord Culpepper of all territory lying between the Rappahannockl and the Potornac. Early] in 1673, he had. granted to Cul- pepper and the Earl of Arlington, their executors. ad- ministrators, and assigns, the entire territory and do- minion of Virginia for thirty-one years; making th em lords proprietary of all the domain, and vesting in them all quitrents, duties, and escheats: - to be paid in specie, and not in commodity. These grants covered not only wild lands, but plantations lGong occupied, improved, and owned under the previous charters of the colony. As soon as these grants began to be put in execution in Virginia, in 1674, they naturally pro- 32    <pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6802-00000194"/> 378.

It was but an  I ungracious return, the people thought, for all their generous loyalty to the king in the years of his exile  and distress. Partial insurrections had taken place; but, having been without c oncert and without a- com- petent head, they had been easily subdued. The As- sembly had immediately sent commissioners to re-    j monstrate with the king, to. solicit a modification or a purchase of the grants, and "to procure a more perfect charter and constitution fo;r Virginia."  This I embassy involved great expense, -- for notliing, could I be effected at the court of Charles II. without enor-  mous bribes,-and created the necessity of special and heavy taxes upon the people, who had now waited a whole year without any encouragement from their commissioners. But neither were border war and unrighteous granlts the only afflictions of Virginia. The Assembly whicli had been convened in 1662, and elected for the term of two years, had not yet been dissolved. Conse- quently, the people had been deprived, during thirteen' years, of the right of electing representatives,. When  ; vacancies had occurred, they had indeed gone to the  polls; but false returns of the elections. had been made - by the sheriffs. In addition to this, a majority of the people'had lost all right of suffrage by a law passed in, 1670, that "none but freeholders and housekeepers    I: should thereafter }have a voice in the election of any burgesses." Thus  the people were disfranchised.   2 The right of representation, so long and so resolutely cherished by the Virginians, was rifled. County ofii-  r cers and parish officers, in whose appointment they -  , I *    @: :i   FRONTIER LIFE.         379 had no voice, arbitrarily laid the taxes in their respec- tive districts; while even the power of levying ,the colonial taxes had been resigned by the Burgesses to     " the Governor and Council. But neither were border -war, and grants of territory, and the loss of representation, with its consequences of arbitrary taxation and irresponsible officials, the only' afflictions of Virginia. The taxes themselves were grievous. - The impoverishing operation of the Navigation Act we have brought to view. It had advanced a step beyond what has been stated, for the trade between the  colonies themselves was   taxed. There was also a tax upon the curing of fish, and 'a tax upon all exports as sWell as imports. The people were taxed for forts to enllforce the Navigation Act; as, in England, men were/condemned to be hung, and to pay forty shillings for the operation.   They were taxed for useless forts on the frontiers.    They were taxed for the very large salary of the Governor. They were taxed for the wages of the Burgesses. They were taxed for the expenses of their commis- sioners in England. They ,were taxed for the emolu- ments of eight justices of the peace in each county, and by the justices at will.*  They were taxed by the parish officers, also at will t  The amounts  of the three last-named taxes were often fraudulently used, or wholly absorbed. by useless officials, or shared by -^.

Besides, there were often taxes for gifts voted by the Assembly "to the Governor and other great men."   All the taxes were laid by the poll, " whereby the poorer sort were in the heaviest condition, who, having nothing but their labor to maintain themselves, wives, and children, paid as deeply to the public as he that had twenty thousand acres." To a people thus oppressed, it was peculiarly irritating that members of the Coun- cil were exempted from all these burdens, and that the royal quitrents, instead of having been applied to the  benefit of the colony, had been given away for a term of years to one Colonel Norwood.  The direct taxa- tion, in general, was sufficiently proper in its objects. Its oppressiveness consisted partly in its excessive' amount, but chiefly in the comparative worthless- ness of the common currency, induced by the Navi- gation Act. Are obstinacy and avarice besetting sins of old age?  Sir William Berkeley was old. Why did he neglect to furnish efficient military aid to the fron- tier-men in their terrible necessity? His obstinacy - we may add, his aristocratic pride -was apparent in his refusal to withdraw the garrisons. But had the high-minded Cavalier become avaricious?  The rec- ords said, that, thirteen years before, he had virtually obtained a monopoly of the lucrative trade with the Indians in furs, and popular rumor said that this kept sition of thirty-five Burgesses, and tobacco at twopence a pound, rather more than it was worth. The taxes for the Commissioners were one hundred pounds of to- bacco per poll, aid from thirty to seventy pounds of tobacco upon every unsuccessful suitor in the courts.

It added, also, that he had an eye to the confiscations which SWould fill his coffers, should the: colonists ven- ture upon unauthorized hostilities. But however this may have been, he did nothing in behalf of the perish- ing, and the Indians still perpetrated their atrocities. The sufferers had petitioned for relief, and had been answered only with promises. They then petitioned that they themselves might march against the savages; they offered to go as volunteers; they offered to go, poor as they were, at their own charges; but the Governor resented and rejected their offers.* Useless and burdensome garrisons, a sham. expedition, and days of public fasting and humiliation, were his only measures for protection. The people went to church armed; they went to court armed.; they went to work armed; they went to bed armed; but they might not go against the Indians armed. Civil dis- abilities and impositions had galled them to a degree which would have vented itself before in open insur- rection, but for their long-established ha,bits of loyalty. Now, under the pressure of a merciless war, they be- gan to take counsel of their natural instincts. Com-  moln wrongs and common peril were ripening common sympathy.  The people came together, here, there, rwherever they could. They talked. They counted their grievances. The gatherings were more fie- quent, more tumultuous, more grave, and more stimulating, and the portentous mutterings of des- peration began to be heard, from the: heads of the rivers to the eastern shore.

CHAPTER    XXIII. THE 'YOUNG PROTECTOR. WITHN some few miles of the Falls of 1676. James River was one of the most inviting plantations in all Virginia. Its western poltion was undulating, and covered with a forest of pine, oak, hicklory, locust, chestnut, &amp;c., where deer, browsed and wild-fowl brooded their young. From its'east- ern portion, where the dwelling of the owner stood, the forest had been cleared away, and its fields were mottled with the various crops usually raised by an ambitious planter of ample means. I1t terminated on the eastward in a broad meadow, lying upon a gen- erous and fertilizing stream. In a small apartment of the mansion, which, though of, but one story, was of spacious dimensions, sat a young mother, whose appearance denoted at once that she had been familiar, with more polished life than belonged to the wilds of Virginia. Her complexion, her features, and lher dress were such as mark the educated and refined woman. The outline of her form was pleasing in its proportions, and indicated health. There was an intent vigor in the manner in which she plied her needle, in the nervous but regular cadence of her foot'as she' rocked the cradle of her little one, and in the quick; eager way in which she occasionally looked[ out upon the la wn, which be-    <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6802-00000197"/> 384   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION.  trayed unusual energy of character. There were un- mistakable marks of mind and refinement around her, as well as in her person and costume. The furniture of the room, though not rich,.was adapted to comfort, and in good taste. There were some little elegances here and there, such as a true woman, likes to collect around her; a few choice engravings upon the wall, and they were classical designs too; a small but beautiful painting of Hagar and Abraam, :in a posi- tion to catch the best light; a few smhil books upon the table, and some hundred or two raniged soberly within a small alcove. Sonme of them had a law-look about them. The young mother herself seemed to be about twenty-two or twenty-three years of age. How did such a one as she happen to stray to Vir- ginia, and find a, hom-e on a frontier swarming tvitl hostile savages?  The question is easily answered. She was a captive. She had been carefully reared and educated in England by the fondest of parents, who were just beginning to find a priecious-reward for their care and anxiety in the cheering Companionslip Wvhich h r opening mind afforded them, when she w^ suddenfy torn from their protection, and consigned to bonds from   which only death could free her. She wept sorely when she was taken on shipboard; but there was not one in the wide world who would lift a finger to restore her to the home of her girlhood.  In such a place as London, to say nothing of rural dis- tricts, there are always to be found young men who think but little of the susceptibility of hearts which have beat two score years or more, and go about   ' plundering old people's treasures, because, forsooth ! their own hearts are young.  I wonder how they can;   THE YOUNG PROTECTOR.     385 for I am old and gray now, and know how palss- ing value is a filial child. - Tut! Our story is about Marion and Nathanael Bacon! . This young gentle- man, now less than l;hirty years of age, was of a good family in the county of Suffolk, in England ; had re- ceived a liberal education; " to his title of Gentle- man, by his long study at the Inns of Court, had added that of Esquire?"; and had tfiavelled freely upon the European continent.' His natural talents, particularly his powers of elocution, -were brillian t. With such, endowments, to which were added a win- ning address, a manly figure, and prepossessing fea- tures, he was a prince among the class of young men who hoodwink fathers and mothers lto steal away their daughters. Marion -- was not proof against his willinning ways and noble heart. She vowed away her life to him at the altar, turned from those who hlad borne and cherished her, and went with him to the wilderness. Such had been the opening fortune of Marion Bacon. And now she sat in. her Virginia home alone, ex- cept the sleeping treasure in the cradle, which she wished she could show to those who had cradled her. The wish woke up Memory, -who whispered a score of bygones in her ear; telling her so tenderly about some little gift, or indulgence, or self-sacrifice, or gentle voice, or fond smile, of that old and dateless love she had left behind, that she covered her face and wept, --not sorrowfully, but lovingly, as young wives often do, when the freshness of wedded life has passed. Suddenly she started to her feet, noiselessly ' Strange News.    <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6802-00000198"/> ou   i aIsHE YUU'l'JL UVf TOlni VtD E ,UUIII.

"And the people?"                 : "Are as stoutly determined as he. I have mingled freely with them, you know. But I have been a lis- tener and an observer only, not a speaker.

But to sit still and be mur- dered, - that passes loyalty, and reason, and nature, and the law of Heaven. They will bear no longer.

But when a people, always loyal, loyal to this very hour, first rise only for the defence of their wives and little ones, and then demand only the restoration of what the crown has given, but the crown's trustee has stolen, 't is no treason, no rebellion, child! If such be trea- son, I 'll be a loyal traitor, but nrever a free-born Briton slave!" "It is a serious affair" said the wife, gravely; "' we must count the cost." i Yes, my love, it is a serious affair, and we will count the cost. Thank God! I have a wife who will help me, by her counsels, her fearlessness, and her prayers. Look you, Marion! The people will rise. They must have a leader, or they will be scat- tered like sheep. Shall your husband lead them ." "I knew it! I knew it!" she exclaimed, "because * Burwell Narrative, 8.    <pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6802-00000199"/> 388   THE YOUTH1 OF THE OLD DOMNION. you said they are men. They would not be, did they not know that my husband has not his equal in Vir-  ginia." Bacon smiled, not only at her words, but at read-  ing the pride, defiance, and gladness which she uncon- sciously betrayed in her voice, her features, and her attitude. Marion Bacon was not the only woman Whose husband, in her eyes, (has been the man of   I men.                         if "But the cost, Marion! the cost! You said we  must count the cost." Yes. I 'll count the cost." "But please remember, you and I have nothing to gain." "Wait! First, the cost. We may lose our for-  tune, of which, God be thanked! he has given us enough. We may lose the fortune which you would inherit from your uncle. We may lose each other, for I know well that Indian warfare is no boys' play; and that governors, if they catch those whom they call rebels, have no tender mercies.

But if Nathanael Bacon will give himself to shield the mothers and children of Virginia from the tomahawk, and to re- deem the rights of freemen, Marion Bacon will give Nathanael.

You will gain the gratitude and prayers of the unprotected. You will gain the satisfaction of mak- ing a noble effort, and risking a noble sacrifice, for freedom. That is enough. And if God grant suc- cess, that will be a gain we cannot, estimate." "Marion! if it be a duty to engage in this affair, I can give my heart; to it, and stake my fortunes. But, seriously, I consider the issue doubtful. Will Sir William yield to what he calls the clamor of a rabble, and authorize, an expedition? If not, the people will go without authority. This may rouse him to some measure which will lead to an open quarrel. If so, the civil rights of the people will not be recovered, I fear, without a bloody struggle, if at all. In such a case, you see what will be my posi- tion, if I head this movement." "I do. On the other hand, 'to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is SIN.' " "What do you mean? That sounds like a quota- tion."'  Marion smiled, rather sadly though, and replied: "You should read your Bible more, Nathanael. Like your namesake whom our Saviour commended, you are 'without guile'; but I fear me you do not search the Scripture so well as he." "Bible! Scripture! Marion, do you mean to say that those words are in the Bible? Say them again." "No, my love, St. James shall. say them to you, himself." She opened a Bible, which he himself had given her, and pointed out the words. Hie read them in silence. He seemed disturbed; for he rose and walked the room for some minutes, absorbed in 33*    <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6802-00000200"/> thought, and without a glance at his -wife.  At length he stopped, and said, with a deep inspiration and an emphatic gesture : , Marion! God's word is a two-edged sword !  " Is that a quotation ?" " Quotation !

Not many men so well off as you, Nat. Bacon junior, Esquire; and if you do go to perdition, you ought to be ashamed!" No one stood higher in Virginia than this youn  man. Though he had been there less than three years, he had already won the esteem of all who knew him, and of multitudes who did not. His command- ing talents had quickly made him conspicuous, without effort or intention of his. He had already been raised to the highest office which he could hold, except that of Governor; and had brought with him ' ,S80, which, with his right to fifty acres of land for himself,   THE YOUNG PROTECTOR.,     393 his wife, and each one of his servants, constituted an easy, if not abundant fortune. He had been induced to leave England by the solicitation of his uncle, Na- thanael Bacon, who resided in Virginia, a gentleman of long standing in the Councill, a very rich politick mnan, and childless, designing this kinsman for his heir." The junior Bacon had, therefore, no private profit to hope for, but the contrary, in sympathizing with the masses and espousing their cause. It was now early in the month of April. The peo- ple were growing very impatient for decided action; and, two or three days after the conversation which we have related, and which represents Bacon's true position and motives, a large number of people gath- ered, and, " with no common zeale, they sent up their reiterated prayers, first to'himselfe, and next to heaven, that he might becom their guardian angel, to protect them from the cruelties of the Indians." Immediate- ly, and doubtless at his suggestion or demand, they made earnest application to the Governor that he would ratify their choice, and grant to their general elect a commission; offering to follow their leader at their own charges. .To this Sir 'William replied by evasive promises. The application wTas repeated, and the promises too. But no commission came. The people could ill brook these delays, which seemed to -them like trifling with their miseries. Accordingly, about the 10th of the month, a body of three hundred men, among whom were nearly all the officers of the government, both civil and military, whose residences were near the heads of the rivers, met in the neigh- borhood of Bacon's plantation for consultation. The question before them was whether to proceed at once lu,*    <pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6802-00000202"/> against the Indians without a commission, .or, yet hoping for one, to suffer passively under the murders by which they wrere yet decimated.: Upon this occasion Bacon addressed the people in a spirited and effective harangue.   The Navigation Act; the enormous and illegal grants of land by the king; the oppressive taxes; the useless and expensive garrisons, vwhich the people began to regard as intend- ed to overawe them rather than thae Indians; the ex- clusion of a large and respectable class of freemen from the right of suffirage; tile unaccountable neglect of the Governor to shield thlem   from  massacre-- these were the topics which he urged and expounded with all the eloquence of a gifted andl indignant mind. He assured theni that he was ready, at the proper time, to lead them   against the savages; and to seek their relief from civil oppression; that for the public good only he was willing thus to hazard his dear- est interests; and that to this end he pledged himself never to lay down arms  until success had crowned their efforts. He concluded by demanding of them a solemn pledge of their faithful co-operation. It was promptly given, and his words were answered by the ringing applause of his hearers.t It was then resolved by the assembly instantly to commence the necessary preparations for an Indian war; to make a  new appli- cation  to the Governor for' a   commission; and to march on a certain day, whiether it were received or not received; f    while Bacon himself declared, that, commission or no commission, if he heard of another   THBE YOUNG PROTECTOR.    395 murder by the savages, he would commence hostili- ties, even though but twenty men should join him.* He immediately drew up and published - as well as he could, for there was no printing-press in Virginia -- a declaration of the public grievances, and the mo- tives for the present rising in arms. This declaration he issued over his own signature. He also addressed a respectful letter, which he sent by a special mes- senger to Sir William Berkeley, stating frankly the necessity for the people's movement, and conjuring him to grant a commission, as the only means of quiet- ing their dissatisfaction t It might have been about 'ten or twelve days after these events, or about the middle of April, when Bacon, with a clouded brow, announced to his -wife that ie had received a letter from the Governor. "Read it," said he, putting it into her hand: I want your opinion." He moodily paced the little garden pathway wher? they had met, while Marion read and again read th letter. ' He does not refuse," she observed, as she refolded the sheet. "Humph! Does not refuse!"

The weather was more than mild; the morning' was very inviting, with its cloudless sky, its bounteous dews, its bird-music, and its rising sun1; and Bacon, i to whom the Governor's letter had but just been de- -  : livered, had found Marion among her pet shrubs and   i  vines. They continued to discuss the offensive let-  i  ter, and were still in the midst of seriofts conference, when Bacon suddenly exclaimed, interrupting his     ; wife: "Good heavens! there is some bad' news'! .

In consequence of their cabals, the Gov- ernor, on the 29th of May, issued a, proclamation, declaring that all who had joined the expedition of Bacon, and " who should not return 'within a limited day-" should be regarded as rebels; and forces were raised "to reduce him  to obedience, with which Sir William advanced. from the Middle Plantation [now Williamsburgh] to find him out, and, if need wa s, to fight him."'

"76, JULY FOURTH. 1676  THE Long Parliamenet" of Virginia - the Assembly elected in 1661, and still in exist- ence - consisted almost altogether of men who had but little sympathy with the masses.  They were chiefly royalists who had fled from England at the downfall of Charles the First; had received the pro- tection and generous hospitalities of the Virginians; had become proprietors of large landed estates; and were conspicuous for their education, their wealth, and their courtly manners. They we(re of that class, significantly English, who arrogated. to themselves aristocratical distinction, official power, and enor- mous emoluments, as a birthright. Hence, with the Governor's connivance, they had retained the reins of government, which had been intr:usted to then only for the brief term  of two years.  Attached to the usages and exclusiveI privileges :of monarchical so. o ciety, ignoring the doctrine of people's rights, and regarding popular liberty as a usurpation, they had trodden in the dust the hard-earned privileges of an -enfranchised province, and driven Lthe rowels deep into the quivering flesh of the people. From this class Sir William Berkeley raised the forces with which he went "to find out Bacon, and, if need was, to fight him."  He had advanced, hoII- t   '76, -JULY FOURTH.  .   401 ever, only thirty or forty miles in the direction. of the James River Falls, when the noise of the people, as the noise of many waters, reached him from the counties in his rear. They were in arms. They had cast off all deference for the authority of the govern- ment, and acknowledged only the decrees of thei r leaders. Retracing his steps, and entering oanes- town, the Governor found it 'almost entirely de- serted," and himself with scarcely more than the shadow of authority. With no small degree of con-. sternation, he found that Bacon zwas; not the only insurgent leader, that the spirit of ;revolution had pervaded almost the whole' colony, and that men of consideration and influence, without concerting with the young general, had placed themselves at the hpad of a resolute people, in open and organized revolt. The popular voice was strong, stern, and distinct. It recited the complaints set forth by Bacon in his Declaration, and demanded the immediate disnian- tling of the frontier forts, and the diss:olution of the Old Assembly. The Governor, upon examining his position, found himself without power to resist, and was obliged to sacrifice his pride and yield. The demands were of necessity complied with, and writs were issued for the election of a new Assembly. The people of course elected such as sharecd in their griev- ances, and would insist upon redress. ' They paid no regard to the law which prescribed that only free- holders should be /eligible as Burgesses.  Bacon, without effecting anything against the hos- tile Indians, who -warily 'fled into t:he remote for- ests as he advanced, returned home, and was soon after " unanimously" elected a Burgess from Hten- 34   ,    <pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6802-00000206"/> 402   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. rico, his own county, although he was a proclaimed rebel. The Assembly was to meet ,on the 5th of June, and Bacon embarked seasonably in a sloop for James- town, accompanied by twenty or thirty armed men. Anchoring before the town, he proceeded - un- known, it would seem- to the house of Mr. Law- rence,.a man of repute, and "l popularly inclined," to reconnoitre, and ascertain whether he mighit with safety appear openly. In the mean time, as a pre- cautionary measure, he had stationed a part of his men in concealment on shore, but within call. A clergyman, to wh:om his person Twas known, saw and recognized him, and reported his arrival and the pres- ence of his soldiers to the Governor, who immedi- ately ordered the alarm beat. Of course the whole town was in commotion.  In the confusion, Bacon escaped with his men aboard his sloop. But finding his vessel " shol; at, was forced to fly up the river" with her.. Perceiving this movement, Berkeley not only sent a long-boat in pursuit, under charge of Cap- tain Thomas Gardner, which obliged Bacon to take to his own for greater speed, but sent orders to cer- tain ships, lying above at Sandy Point, to intercept him.  Thus beset, and finding escape impossible without bloodshed, Mr. Bacon, after parley and ca- pitulation, " quietly surrendered himself prisoner " to Captain Gardner, " to the great satisfaction of all his friends." By Gardner he was transferred to the cus- tody of Major Hone, the High Sheriff "of James- town. ' * "Strange News from Virginia," though in the main not reliable, affords a clew to the seemingly differing accounts of Bacon's visit and   '76, JULY FOURTH.          03 Bacon's surrender without iresistance had a pacify-  ing influence upon Sir William, which partly explains "the surprising civility " with which 'he accosted his prisoner. "Mr. Bacon! have you     forgot to be a gentle- man? "No, may it please your Honor."  Then I will take your parole"; and he immedi- ately set him at liberty, "without confining him either to prison or chamber," but the men wht'o had accom- panied him  were plut in irons.   These occurrences seem to have taken place on the 4th of June. "The next forenoon," the Burgesses., having assem- bled and organized, were summoned to meet the Gov- ernor and Council.   Sir William  addressed them par- ticularly upon their Indian affairs, protesting, " with a pathetic' emphasis," against the slaughter of the chiefs at the Piscataway fort, Colonel Washington and  his associate. commander both    being  present members of the H-ouse.

I think the three not inconsistent, and have accordingly blended them all in the text. T. M. says that the arrest took place while Bacon was yet on his way down the river to Jamestown. That this writer, as Camp- bell observes, "was a Burgess present in Jamestown about the time of Bacon's capture," hardly justifies a reliance upon his very brief state- ment of these occurrences as " the more probable " ; for, as T. M. him- self says, the arrest took place beobre his 'own arrival. The Burwell Narrative contradicts all the others.    <pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6802-00000207"/> 404   THE YOUTH OF THEI OLD DOMNION. On the next Saturday, the 10th of the month,* the Council and Burgesses being again in joint conven-   ! vention, the Governor rose and saidl: "If there be joy  d in the presence of angels over one sinner that repent- eth, there is joy now; for we have a penitent sinner come before us. Call Mr. Bacon." Bacon then' made his appearance, and, bending upon one knee before the Governor, read and deliv- ered to him a paper, in which he confessed his de- parture from duty in raising an armed force, begged pardon for his offence, and (' promised, upon the word' and faith of a Christian and a gentleman, that, upon such pardon granted, he would demean himself duti- fully, faithfullyi and peaceably to the government-and laws of the country." A short silence followed the reading of the paper, when the Governor replied: "God forgive you! I forgive you, - I forgive you, - I forgive you!" "And all that were with him?" asked Colonel Cole, one of the Council. "Yes," replied Sir William, ' and all that were with himn."                        " This seems to have referred more particularly to    ' those who hadaccompanied Bacon to Jamestown, and who -were then in irons.

Mr. Lawrence, to whose house Bacon wentl when he first came to Jamestown, was a. gentleman of tal- ents and sobriety, " nicely honest, affable, withlout blemish in his conversation and dealings," and had received an education at Oxford,. His house was a place of public entertainment, and a rendezvous of- men of high standing; for his accomplishments and, his " even temper '"  were attractive to persons of all ranks.  Constitutioinally, and by education, he was of a kindred spirit with Bacon, and also shared openly in his political sympathies, having been a leader of the people in the, late revolt in the lower and middle counties. He Was now Ia member of the House of Burgesses.  He and Drummond-    a Scotchman, and lately the Governor of North Carolina, and also a resident in Jamestown and a, Burgess -- had just been publicly denounced by Berkleley to the House as " tw o rogues of whom they should beware."  Ba- con, therefore, was naturally drawn into intimacy and friendship with Lawrence, and nowfolund lodgings in his house. The elder Bacon, as a member of the Council, had pe Juliar facilities of information daring the present crisis of his nephew's affairs, and had labored indefatigably in his behalf.  It was by his hand that the recantation of the latter had been" drawn up, and through his influence and earnest entreaties that it had been reluctantly signed and the Indian army; but upon further inquiry into his affairs, it was not thought fit to be granted." Probably this was the exact truth, and that the partial, and perhaps' equivocal, promise was honestly and fairly understood by Bacon, as .absolute. That Berkeley, while avoiding a . literal promise, intended it as an anodyne to Bacon and his partisans, is strongly indicated by his subsequent behavior.         ,    '76, JULY FOURTH.      407 published.'  To him the young patriot na urally went to vent his chagrin and indignation, w len he found that the Governor would balkl himr of his com- mission. He was peculiarly irritated by his disap- poinhtment, having just heard of fresh murders com- mnitted by the Indians. The old gentheman sympa- thized with hiin in his peculiarly trying position, and shared his. anxieties for his family so exposed upon the very precincts of war; but he also succeeded in imparting something of his own cooler deliberateness. The young man was at length persuaded to curb his wravth, and, for a day or two at least, to wait the course of events. The elder pramised to watch care- fully every movement which might concernn the latter;, andL thus they parted. But the young mran had hardly composed himself to sleep that night;, when he was roused by his kinsman and Lawrence. '; Up! up, my son!" said the old gentleman, spoil- inog a very promising dream about Marion.

You will probably swing on a gallows, if you don9t get into your boots quick.'" "Ha! well, let him catch me!:' "'He will be about it quickly," said Lawrence.

Their interview had been sudden, their words few ;' for time was press- * ing, and the little band without were impatient. They gave a shout as he reappeared; and the moment he rejoined them, they were in rapid motion, and soon out of sight. Three or four days after Bacon's flight, there was a great bustle in Jamestown.

The boys were full of fun; the women, of won- derful stories and wonderful curiosity; and the men, of politics and wise predictions. Bacon's name was on everybody's lip; and everybody but sheriffs, sec- retaries, and tide-waiters was wishing blessings on his head. News had that day been received that he was within thirty miles, at the head of four hundred men, infantry and cavalry, on his way to Jamestown. Sir William was at once in. business, deep; de- spatching orders for militia, and messengers for intel- ligence ; receiving reports ; and debating with his dis- turbed and divided Council. The next day came ti- dings that the young general's forces were increasing; and then there was more gossip in the houses and, streets, and more writing and talking in the Gover- nor's apartment. The place of rendezvous which he had appointed for the train-bands was at some dis- tance; and he was told, to his vexation, that but a few stragglers had appeared. The next day expresses from the country came in hourly. Bacon's forces still increased, and he -was in motion, they said. But the York train-bands grew very slowly; they who had mustered did not number one hundred, and were sulky,-"-no t one half of them sure, neather," was   '76, JULY FOURTH.     413 reported to Berkeley; and he had a body-guard oJf only twenty men. The next day Bacon was near; the train-bands were so sluggish in' their motions, that now they could not arrive in season. Resistance was out of question; but the proud old Governor could meet the storrm bareheaded and alone, and he would. A little after noon the insurgeiat ifrces lwere filing over the isthmus; and by two oioeck they had formed, six hundred horse and foot, and in good order, upon the State-house green. , They immediately proceeded to take possession of all the avenues, and to disarm all in town. About an hour and a half afterwards,-- during which tinie the Hotise had entered upon their afternoon session,- -Bacon advanced between two files of soldiers-to a point near a corner of the State- house, where he was met by the Governor and Council. I    Here!" exclaimed the veteran Cavalier, whose blood was just now up to youthful heac. "Here,!  and he presented his naked breast; shoot me! 'Fore God, a fair markl! "No; mlay it please your honor," answered Bacon, courteously, " we will not hurt a hair of your head., nor of any other man's." "Shoot! shoot!" persisted the Governor; "a fair mark!" which he repeated again and agarin, in great excitement. Neither did he add any other \vords. "No, your honor!" answered the young rman, be- ginning to be infected with the 'passion of the other: we are come for a commrission to save our lives from the Indians,--the commission which you have so often promised." "Shoot!" reiterated Berkeley, still standing haugh- ty and erect, with his breast bared. 35*    <pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6802-00000212"/> "4    THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. Bacon, roused by receiving insulting challenges to murder, in lieu of an answer, gave way to violent ges- ticulation, and repeated, "No, we come for a commis- sion; and we will have it, too, before we go." Without any answer, Sir William turned, with the air of a man distracted, and walked, attended by his Council, toward his private apartment at the other end of the State-house. It is recorded that the young general now lost his teimper, and followed the Governor, with " outragious postures," exclaiming: "Damn my blood! I Ill kill Governor, Council, Assembly, and all; and then I '1 sheathe my sword in my own heart!" In the mean time, says the chronicler, the Burgesses were eagerly looking from    the windows upon    the scene bd1ow, when Bacon's body-guard presented their cocked fusils at them, crying,! We will have it! we will have it! '  Upon which one'of the, House, waving a handkerchief, cried out: "You shall! you shall!" when the soldiers shouldered their pieces, and stood quiet.  "Afterwards," it is added, "'t was said, Ba- con had given a signall to his men who presented their fusils at those gazing out at the window, that, f he, should draw his sword, they were on sight of it to fire and slay them." * * It will be perceived that I have not-.stated Bacon's passionate threat of wholesale slaughter, and his private order to his soldiers, as facts. v They are wholly inconsistent with his uniform character and deportment, eveni under greater provocations. The threat was too silly even for a child; and it was utterly at variance with the first words which he uttered to Sir William. The threat, and the order to the sol- diers, rest altogether, as T. M. himself admits, the one upon the asser- tion of his servant, "who in the hubbub got'nigh " to Bacon and Berke- ley, and the other upon mere rumor. Besides, the Burgesses were   '76, JULY FOURTH.        415 An hour afterwards, Bacon entered the chamber of the Burgesses, urging that he should have a commis- sion, and pleading eloquently, for the space of half an hour, the miseries of swar and oppression under which the people were groaning. The House then proceeded witf the bill before them, ordering a levy of one th   sand men against the Indians, and appointingmacon commander-in- chief. For a long time the high-mettle4d Governor refused to sign this bill, which, in his view, sanctioned an act of rebellion.  But the importunity of the As- sembly and of the Council prevailed:; so that he signed not only the commission of General for Bacon, but also a bill " of indemnity to Bacon and his party for committing this force, and a highly applausive let- ter was writ in favor of Bacon's' designs and proceed- ings to the King's Majesty, signed by the Governor, Council, and Assembly."' By this Assembly the people were restored to their rights; and thus one great object of Bacon's move- ment was accomplished.   Besides making provision for the Indian war and its command in accordance with the popular voice, they put an end to the imo- nopoly of the Indian trade; they gave to the freemen of parishes the election of their own vestry-men; they restored to all freemen the right of sufirage, and the more than half of them warm partisans of Bacon, and he knew it. For these reasons, -to say nothing of the prolific habits of Rumor in an hour of intense popular- excitement, -these murderous allegations against Bacon may fairly be considered as apocryphal. * T.

A few days after sign- ing Bacon's commission, the uneasy Governor dis-, solved the Assembly. Such were the fruits of the general movement among the people, which the young gpatriot Bacon had initia'ted and propelled by his bold, minanly, and persistent course, and at the imminentl hazard of his' life, his fortune, and his good name. Through his example, and by m.eans of his Declaration, the people had been roused., 'while he .was yet in' the wilder- ness, to demand the suppression of the garrisons, and the dissolution of the old Assembly. Through his influence, they had taken their stand, in the elec- tion of a, new Assembly, upon the universal right of suffrage and.the eligibility of all freemen to, a seat in the legislature. It Wvas through his influence, there- fore, that this remedial legislation was prosecuted, and, on the 4th of July,' ratified. On that day, .and under his auspices, Virginia toolk her stand, alone, against lawless tyranny; and on the same day of the same month, the sa:me spirit of resistance, matured by the added &gt;wrongs of just one', hundred years, once more arose, .- too well taught, to be bullied, and too stout to .be subdued. On the same day of the same month, just one hundred years aftervards, andL bring- ing in her hand the same principles of freedom im- perishably embodied by another of her sons, but no longer in her childhood or alone, Virginia again stood, * June 24th, Old Style.

The Fourth of July in sev.. enteen hundred and seventy-six was the offspring of that other fourth of July in sixteen hundred and sev- enty-six.- The spirit of Bacon lived after him. The influence of his struggle for rational independence was never lost. Suppressed indeed, but fresh, it sur- vived for three generations.

THE INSURRECTION. 1676  THE young General lost no time. Hs first step was to organize the military resources of the country. In this grave work he: not only mani- fested military skill, but statesmanlike sagacity. First obtaining the signature of the Governor to a sufficient numbber of blank commissions, he sought for men truly competent, and who would at the same time be acceptable both to the Governor himself and to the people. For this purpose, he diligently asked, advice and information. Ascertaining that the present com- manders of the militia would be willing to serve un- der him, with much labor and despatch he drafted a list of their. names, with which he filled the blank com- missions; thus. confiding the execution of his plans to "the first men in the colony in fortune, rank, and in- fluence." To these men, in their respective counties, he assigned the command of well-armed companies, and the duty of ranging the forests, swamps, and other places of their districts, in which the Indians might lurk for mischief. Thus the whole country was at once under organized, authorized, and efficient military protection; and the planters went to their neglected fields with a sense of security, and a glad- ness of heart, to which they had long been strangers. Bacon reserved for himself a different sphere of opera-   THE INSURRECTION.     419 tions,- te remote strongholds of the enemy. As soon as he had completed his judicious arrangements, he placed himself at the head of his men, and made directly for Gloster County, the most populous and aristocratic in Virginia. Here he. paused to disarm, in virtue of his authority of military co immander-in- chief, those partisans 'there who were disposed to embarrass his movements. He then ]proceeded up the river toward the frontier. When he had almost reached the head of the river, and was ,"fitting his provisions" for his plunge into the wooded wilderness, he wsas surprised by the sudden arrival of a horseman, who 'rode to his quarters at full speed.. He brought letters, which Bacon: had no sooner read than he turned to the two or three who happened to be pres- ent, saying, with slight' indications of disturbance: 'I Gentlemen, a council, with all speed! I would have every officer present;." And hel immediately re- tired to an inner apartment of his cabin. Less than half an hour had passed, when, the offi- cers being assembled, he appeared before them, very cool in his demeanor, but in his rigid, moody features bearing unmistakable evidence of smothered anger. "Gentlemen!" said he, "through letters from ]Mr. Lawrence and Mr. IDrumnond; I have the honor to inform you that your General isa rebel! He has just been so proclaimed by his Majesty's Governor of Vir- ginia. Sir William Berkeley is now raising the train- bands of Gloster and Middlesex against us; meaning either to attack us in our rear immediately, or to wait and fall upon us as'we return weary and worn by the hardships of our campaign. I submit to you three questions:- Will you disperse to your homes, rather %                . ^     <pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC6802-00000215"/> 420   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. than follow a rebel? Will you follow him forthwith against the Indians? Will you turn and face his Majesty's Governor of Virginia? I tell you frankly, gentlemen, that he has gone there in compliance with a request from persons residing there." The consternation produced by this announcement was great. There was, however, but little debate. It was promptly decided, that, though the expedition against the Indians must not be abandoned, this de- sign to cut in pieces the protectors and servants of the people must first .be dealt with. "Such," exclaimed Bacon, now giving. way to his emotions, "such, gentlemen, I did believe would be your opinion. It is mine. We must take care of ourselves, or we cannot take care of our wives and V children. Even :ow the savage may be prowling around some unprotected family, or shedding their blood. But if we advance to their defence, or re- venge, we may ourselves be crippled by our own countrymen, or rather by both assailants, like corn between the stones. It vexes. me to the heart,' he added vehemently, " that, while we are hunting the wolves, tigers, and bears which daily destroy our harmless and innocent lambs, we should be pursued in the rear with a full cry, as more savage beasts. We will return. Let the order be given for instant march." The patriot soldiers now retraced their steps, with forced marches, "to attack the Governor before he could be reinforced." Re-entering first the county of Gloster, and finding that Sir William had evaded him, the General sent out parties of horse to bring before him as prisoners various individuals of whom   THE INSURRECTION.     421 he had reason Qo be suspicious. To these he offered a strict oath that they should not molest' him in his operations against the Indians ; and all who took it- were immediately set at liberty. Ha:ving effected this precautionary measure, he turned southward to 'the Middle Plantation,--the Williamsburg of to- day, -whre h    ee halted, fifteen miles from James- town. In the mean time, the summons of Berkeley to the freemen of Gloster ard Middlesex had been obeyed. T Twelve hundred had assembled on the day and place appointed. He proposed that they should pursue and disperse the forces of the rebel General. The proposal was heard with amazement. Debate' arose, between the few who had induced the Governor to this course, and the reti; of the convention. The overwhelming opinion was, in substance, that Bacon had gone on an important and pressing service "against the common enemy, who had in a most barbarous manner murthered some hundreds of their deare brethren and countrymen, and who would, if not prevented by God and the endeavours of good men, do their utmost for to cut off the wholl Collony. It was, therefore, against right reason" that they should do as the Governor proposed. "But should the Generall, after the Indian war was finished, at- tempt anything against his Honer's person and Gov- ernment, they would rise up in arms with a joint consent, for the preservation of both." Having thus expressed their sentiments, greatly to the chagrin of 'the Governor and his too sanguine advisers, the whole convention "4 disbanded to their. owne aboads," enthusiastically shouting, as they moved away, "Ba- s6    <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6802-00000216"/> 422   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. con!"Bacon!"B 6acon!" Berkeley, seeing the temper of the counties in which he confided as the most loyal in Virginia, and having intelligence of Bacon's countermarch, retired crestfallen with a few of his adherents across the Chesapeake, thirty miles,. to Accomac, or ' the Eastern Shore." Before his de- parture,'howeevr', lhe again proclaimed Bacon a rebel and a traitor, on the 29th of July. 4' Accomac, al- though subject to the authority of Virginia, was nominally and legally a distinct territory." The young General was in a perplexing condition. Intrusted by the representatives of the people with a solemn and critical mission, .he was suddenly obliged to defend himself against the civil authority. Thus situated, he certainly needed the highest'guaranty for his own safety, and the highest sanction. for con- tinuing in armls for the country's defence. This he saw, and instantly adopted bold and decisive meas- ures. His first act was to issue a manifesto, declar- ing his true position as a loyal patriot. ; Can we," he demanded, 4; deserve the name of rebels a'nd traitors? we, who are wholly devoted to our king and country, who aim only at our country's good? we, who are mustered here, with our lives and our fortunes in our hands, purposely and only to sub- due those who are at war with our sovereign and country? we, who have never attempted or plotted a single wrong to any of his Majesty's subjects, in their lives, namesj fortunes, or estates? We point to our behavior. 'What man's house have we plun- dered? What man's' purse have we touched? What. man's corn, or tobacco, or cattle, have we distrained?

Some of them came here poor. That is no sin. But now they are rich. That is no sin. But how did they get their riches, in a country where the faces of the poor are ground? They have been office-holders. Ay, and sponges that have sucked up the public treasury, wrhich the people have filled by the sweat of the brow. Is it not so? Judge ye. What, arts, what sciences, what schools of learning, what manufactories, have these men promoted? "Our hostile intentions against the Indians are just. We need not prove it. 'It is written in blood.

The call of the General was promptly answered. On the 3d of August, " a grate, conven- tion of the people met him at his quarters"'; " most of the Prime Gentlemen of those parts, whereof some were of the Councell of State." Bacon addressed the convention at length, and with great eloquence; urging them to devise some expe- dient to secure the country both against Sir William and the Indians; and reminding them,' tha tneither reason nor common sense required that he and his soldiers should march against the savages, without assurance " not to have their throts cut when they should return horie, 'by those who had set them to worke."           /  First of all, it was declared by the convention, that Sir William Berkeley, by his withdrawal from the territory of Virginia to Accomac, ihad abdicated the government; that therefore it was vacant; and that, * Cotton, 6; Burwell Narrative, 15.               ,.

That, should any forces be sent from England to support the Governor, they would resist them, until the country's cause should be heard and decided upon by the King. I On the last two articles there arose great' debate, which continued from noon until midnight. For their adoption, however, Bacon was resolute; urging, with great argumnent and elo- quence, that uzter security and protection fox himself and his army was but reasonable, if they engaged in the country's work. He added, also, that, if these could not be given, he must surrender his commis- sion. At this juncture, two items of news arrived; the one, that the Indians had just made a murderous inroad, upon Gloster County; the other, that York fort--the most considerable in the country--had just been stripped by Sir William of all its muni- * Burk, I. 172.   t Cotton, 6.. t Burwell, 17.    s Ibid.      1' Ibid. 36* * - ,  '          i    <pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC6802-00000218"/> 426   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. tions bf war, leaving multitudes of frightened people withili its walls at the mercy of the prowling savages. Fresh murders, and the rdbbery of the fort, stimulated the convention to a decision. All the articles of agreement were passed, concluding with the words, "and we do swear, that we will him, the said Gen- eral, and the army under his command, aid and assist accordingly." It was als6 expressly declared in the' body of the engagement, that they did "'believe in their consciences that it consisted with the welfare of the country, and with their allegiance to his Most Sacred Majesty." Writs were then issued, in his Majesty's name, and signed by Bacon and four of the Council who were present,. for the, election of an Assembly, to meet on the 4th of September. The General, now having the sanction of the peo- ple, and their warrant a that he might proceed without molestation, once more departed upon the errand of mercy and retribution which he had so long been striving to accomplish. By his previous excursions, the Indians' had become aware that the wrath of the colonists was aroused, and that a vigorous war was at hand. This had occasioned a new combination of  the various border tribes for offence and defence. No sooner, therefore, had Bacon retraced his steps to. baffle the schemes of the Governor, than they had resumed their bloody incursions. To put a stop to these was now his first object, and he quickly drove them back from the confines of Gloster. They re- treated slowly before him, annoying him whenever they could without serious exposure, and confining themselves to stealthy and harassing- operations. More or ,ess of 'them, however, fell victims to the   THE INSURRECTION.      427 vigilance and resolution of the General. He also destroyed several of their villages, their. corn-fields and their granaries. Still they kept on hisS)ront; sometimes' showing themselves, and shouting deri- sively beyond gunshot; and sometimes firing from ambush upon 'the advanced scouts, then instantly darting away, unseen and scathless. Thus step by step, and from point to point, they ,drew the arnmyy into the forest depths; on, and still on, from the Pamunkey towns to the Chickahominy, and thence still farther into the wilds. They were luring the Virginians toward the point; where their warriors were gathering with overwhelming force, to smite the strength of the colony at a blow. And the young General and his men followed their lure un- consciously, boldly, steadily, eager to avenge the widows and the fatherless; by day, toiling slowly along their pathless and perilous course; by night, stretching themselves, wearied' but still stout-hearted, upon the naked ground. Stimulated as they were by the recollection of neighbors and kindred burned at the stake or flayed alive, they needed no other incen- tive to perseverance, and asked- no bett;er fare. , At length the ambuscades' grew more frequent; painted warriors were oftener seen at safe distance, waving or shouting defiance; but still the hardy pioneers pa- tiently pushed on whither the foe was gathering for battle. Could they have been told beforehand that he would have stood at bay, they would have heard the news with exultation. But they were destietl to meet him suddenly, on ground of his ow-n choosing, in his full strength, and ravening for slaughter.* * Burk,!I. 175, 176.    <pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6802-00000219"/> 428   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. There were now strong palisades around the dwell- ing at Curie's, -the name of Bacon's residence,-- sadly marring the beauty of the spot, but necessary for safety. These had been erected immediately after the murder of. Bacon's overseer and servant. The laborers upon the plantation used their own cabins, which were detached and somewhat scattered, only as places for food and rest during the heat of the day. Within' a very few miles of the boundary line be- tween the Indians and the colony, and where the population was comparatively scanty, they had not the same security against attack which some other districts enjoyed under the new military arrangement. Consequently, they were ever on their guard ; tilling the field under the watch of sentinels, and each work- man with his weapons at hand. Before evening twi- light, they daily returned ii a compact body to their master's mansion:, which now served as a fort. The one passage through the palisades was then closed and strongly secured; and 'soon after, a watch was set for the night. Marion had constituted herself the commander and inspector of the place, which was as clearly insurrection against the authority of her hus- band- for she had no "' commission - as his defen- sive behavior, at the outset of disturbances, was insur- rection against that of the Governor. She had been well informed, from time to time, by her husband's messengers, of his embarrassments and his measures; but for a few days past she had received no tidings. She only knew, that, not far from  Chickahominy Swamp, he had struck into the pathless forest, and that the Indians were hanging on his march. She had her solicitude about him, of course; but it did ^ "  '              *  '   *   THE INSURRECTION.      429 not prey upon her peace, for it was sweetly subdued and held in check by that Heaven-born faith through which many, "of whom the world was not worthy, have stopped the mouths of lions, escaped the edge of the sword, waxed valiant in 'fight, and turned to flight the armies of the aliens." Her choice things she intrusted to the disposal of Our Father. Thus she was dauntless and placid, yet full of care ald vigilance. She felt just as responsible for the safe- keeping of her dependents, as though there were zno Eye which, neither slumbers nor sleeps. When they returned from the field, she met them at; the gate, to gladden them with her bright face and her words of welcome, to inspect the fastening of bar and bolt, to receive the key, to unchain the dogs, to go 'the rounds of the enclosure, and to apportion to each one his am- munition and duty for the night. Upon these occa- J sions, she was always attended by a gray-headed man, maimed of an arm, who was sometimes very garrua- lous about the thundering charges of Cromwell's Ironsides. He was always wishing that he had a squadron of such fellows in Henrico County. Noth- ing ever did stand before them, he said, ,and nothing ever could. By one week's ride, with them at his heels,..he would have all the infernal savages within twenty miles, as easily as a boy would minims in a scoop-net. Saved-by-Grace Staunton did not like the Prayer-Book. It looked too much like the hand- writing of ordinances, he said. If other folks could /prevail with Heaven by it, he had no objection; but he never could. One evening, about the middle of the month, after the gate was secured and the servants had dispersed, 5 ,'          '\    <pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC6802-00000220"/> 430   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. the old soldier, who was precise in his rways, vainly attempted; as he had vainly done a thousand times before, to assume a, measured martial tread by the side of his mistress, as they proceeded around the circuit. The short, quick step of the lady pothered him ex- ceedingly; and every few yards his awkward skip of a step-- to time for once with her - showed how much for his com} t it would have been had she been trained in the camp, and how much he would like to berate her if she were only a man. But Saved-by- Grace was as deferential to his superiors as he was exact in his locomotion. Besides, he was strongly attached to Marion, having been born into the service, and under the roof-tree, of her father's family. So he stoically shuffled along withoutt a murmur. IBut the privileged old man had talking-matter to his heart's content. "Why do the heathen rage?" he exclaimed, as soon as the servants were out of ear-shot. "You have the same accounts of the Indians, I suppose, Staunton? 'Dame Bacon! of a surety they come up like the frogs of Egypt."' "What can be their purpose?" "The Lord only knoweth the hearts of men. I did think that they would pay us a visit. But they have some other plan, I fear." "You fear!" "I should like a brush with them. a But not around our house, Staunton!" ' And why not? Marion Bacon is not afraid; and it would be the most convenient place for me." "No, Staunton, I am not afraid; and should they   THE INSURRECTION.      431 come, I think I should do my duty. But I shall not entice them, nor pray for their conming." "I should be glad of their coming, for the sake 'of their scattering. I remember Mr. Shortridge and William." But you said they have some other plan. What?" "I do not know, dame. But since they have be- gun to show themselves more within a day or two, I find they have a fort." "Where"?  "On Crooked Run, about two miles and a half-- peradventure three miles - from here ;anrd there are some hundreds of then there, at least." "How do you know this?" "By my eyes.' The lady looked up in astonishment; and her coun- tenance plainly expressed displeasure.  Dame Bacon! a garrison should always send out scouts for intelligence of the enemy. Tt is as impo:r- tant as any practice in war, in order to ascertain his position, his force, and his movements. It was said unto me in a vision of the last night, ' Saved-by- Grace!' And I said, ' Here am I.' . And lo! the vis- ion frowned until I did quake exceedinlgly, Then it said: ' Sirrah! thou art a lazy scoundrel.

But how did you go, and what did you discover?" ' Good dame! as for the manner of my going, for the most part, after I had gained the woods, it was on my hands and knees- I mean, on my knees and hand, --though ofttimes I was fainL to crawl like a snake.'" "It is a woonder you:were not shot and scalped." "The devils were like grasshoppers, but the Lord suffered them not.." "\Well?" "I could not. judge nicely of the distance, for I never reconnoitred 'before after such a fashion. But to judge from the time and by the feeling of my limbs, I should say a dozen miles, only I know better. It is about three.

Called Apollyon, sometimes, dame!? Such Eas all, of importance to our nariative, which passed at the time betwxeen Marion and her lieuten- ant. The little family garrison .was scrupulously in- spected, as usual; the evening meal was eaten in peace; and the evening offering of prayer was ren- dered; when all retired to rest, save those on. guard, and the lady, who sat musing by the window till the moon went down. The morrow brought a new state of things at Curle's. The first incident which attracted the atten- tion of Marion was a commotion in the dog-kennels.   THE INSURRECTION.      433 The animals, about the middle of the forenoon, sud- denly grew uneasy, starting, growling, and in a ver;y short time howling and frantic. Marion knew a t once that there was some sufficient cause for appre- hension; and though she could neither see nor hear a single other token of danger, her mind immediately reverted to the strange increase of ]ndians in the neighborhood, and to their new garrison on Crooked Run. She had no 'doubt the mastiffs haLd detected some hostile movement on the part of the savages, for whom the creatures had a trained antipathy. Nor was she long in suspense, for she soon. perceived her servants at this unusual hour retuining from the field, evidently for refuge. -Saved-by-Grace, for reasons which he had not chosen to communicate, had that morning, gp'pe out with them, and was now marching, with hisubest military air, at their head. The old. sol- dier had for weeks 1kept them anier daily drill, and had not only trained them to certain evolutions adapt- ed to repel atck both in field and fort, but to a reg- ularity of tread which was his special pride and de- light. In. his best style, h1e Vow wheeled thlem in front of the gate just as it was throwln op;en by a stout wench whom her mistress had sent for the purpose.; nor did he suffer them to break up their array until'he had led theme with due precision to the usual point 'wyithin the inclosure, when they were dismlissed in true militar/y form. Marion was impatient under the Rounidhead's formality; but nis duty as a commander over, he caime directly to report to his superior. With a stiff military salute, he announced: ' There is a noise, Dame Bacon, in the camp of the Philistines,-- a noise as of many rushing to battle.

"And you think you are afraid? "Golly, missus! nebber, nebber! Cato be cussed shame nigger when him catch 'fraid 'fore missus!" The forenoon passed away, but the dull report of guns was still heard at intervals. The strife was evi- dently protracted; and notwithstanding all her efforts at self-control, Marion was conscious of anxiety to a degree which was becoming painful, especially when she caressed her babe and coaxed out; ts unpractised sniles. But she -was soonl relieved. About three o'clock two horsemen approached at a round trot, and halted before the gate. It devolved upon Saved-by- Grace to meet them, which he did, and, after a mo- ment's p arley, gave them admission. They bore the marks of hard fighting; and one of them was in a condition whch required both lint and. restoratives. They had been despatched by Bacon, from whom they brought a verbal message that he was near, and should soon be at Curle's. They also gave an account of the long and desperate fight, which had ended in the complete rout of the Indians. It was remem- bered long afterwards as the battle of ]Bloody Run, at which the strength of the Indians in that district was for ever crippled.' There had been a terrible slaugh- ter of them before they would abandon the strife. In less than an hour afterwards came in wourded men, some having yet strength enough to keep their feet or saddles, some transported on litters. They * Burk, II. 176.

Marion's premises now assumed the aspect of a hospital; and she devoted herself assiduously to suich surgery as she could contrive. 'The poor suflfrers lay scattered here and there, some on the floors of the house, some out of doors, some on pallets and some on the ground. Marion went from man to man, to minister to their relief; and as she kneeled beside them, examniing and washing their wounds, carefully applying lint and bandage, or ministering cordials, - all with' her own hands,- the rough ba ckwoodsmln half forgot faintness and suffering in admiration of her precious Christianity, and faltered more ejacula- tions to Heaven in her behalf thai she heard. or dreacmed off.

A busy, sleepless night it was for both, and few were the minutes which they could snatch for conver- 37     <pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC6802-00000224"/> 438   THE YOUTI[ OF TEIE OLD DOMNION. sation, so busy was she with the wounded, and he in preparing for an early march. .There were many prisoners at. the fort, and a detachment must be left to guard them, while he should proceed with his main force, and with all speed, across the James River, to chastise the Appomattock Indians, and others farther south. Allowing his hardy men only indispensable rest, the next dayhe was again on the march. This southern expedition, which he prosecuted .as far as the banks of the Roanoke, was also successful; and he returned thence "to the head of York River," where his presence, for some reasons to us unknown, was temporarily required.' But his 'men had been worn by a most harassing campaign, in which they had travelled several hundred miles in various direc- tions. Such. being their condition, and "the Indians having been sent packing a grate way from the bor- ders," he had dismissed his army to their homes, that they might recruit " against the next intended expedi- tion," reserving only a few' as a resource in any sud- den emergency. It was now the 9th or 10th of September, when suddenly Lawrence, Drummond, and Hansford, who bore a commission of colonel under Bacon, appeared at his quarters, with the news that Sir William Berkeley on the 8th had entered Jamestown. in triumph, with a force of from six hundred to a thousand men.. The General had before heard that Giles Bland, who had attempted with a force of four armed vessels to sur- prise the Governor at Accomac, had failed, himself * Compare Burk, II. 176, with Campbell, 91, and note, and with Cotton, 7.   THE INSURRECTION.      439 and his vessels having been captured, partly by strata- gem and partly by treachery. "Sir William had us under the guns of si3en or seventeen armed vessels," said Hansford. "Our de- fensive means were nothing. We numbered, to 'be sure, some eight or nine hundred men, but we could lnot resist artillery." "We had no choice," added Lawrence, "but to turn traitors or abandon the place. We chose, and advised, the latter." The General mused in silence while these and other circumstances were related, manifesting neither sur- prise nor disturbance. At last he said coolly: "The fox mus be unearthed. I have only three hundred tired me4, but they have stout hearts." Quick in his action as in his decision, he beat to arms, would not wait for reinforcements, but, confid- ing in the enthusiasm and tried courage of those about him, immediately commenced a rapid march toward Jamestown.'    - B' Burk, II. 182.     <pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6802-00000225"/> CHAPTER    XXVI. TIE SIEGE.- THE CATASTROPHE. pr6  THE sun was just going down, when, to the 1676. great consternation of Sir William Berkeley, the arch-rebel was upon him. Bacon, first pausing on the height of the mainland to concert his plans, led his men along the neck towards the town. Throwing himself from his horse, he speedily traced with his own hands a line for an intrenchment in front of a palisade which intersected the neck, barring farther advance. Calling upon his men to lose no time, when a few hours of hard labor that night would save them blood and life to-morrow, and throwing. off his upper gar- ments, he seized a spade, and plied his own strength to the work. The men could scarcely drag them- selves along for. weariness when they had entered upon the isthmus, and now would gladly have lain down upon the marshy ground and slept. But their young General had imparted his owni indomitable enthusiasm, and they forgot their fatigue under the inspiration of his example. Every man' sprang to the work; the moon shone out to cheer and help them; and before midnight they had thrown up a breastwork of trees and earth sufficient for their present purpose. 'They then took refreshment, and lay down exhausted on the wet ground and slopt. "My dear aunt!" said Bacon to a royalist lady, / *  '   THE SIEGE.       441 who, to her surprise, found herself in a rebel camp at daybreak; ' my dear aunt! my word for it, I did not expect to find yot' here!" "It 's not with my consent, I assure you," replied Madame Bacon, in a tone of resentmen t. I have no relish for a midnight ride on a pillion with a vulgar trooper, and a rebel too"; and the' lady pursed her lips and straightened, as though'she felt the indignity keenly. "May I be permitted to ask what are Gen- eral Bacon's commands?' Dear madam! Colonel Bacon is now with Sir William Berkeley. You will not object to joining him, I suppose?"  "By no means, most gracious nephew! So you have given me this very odd ride, just to introduce me to mny husband! I am distinguished by your kind consideration, surely.^'  I protest, dear aunt," taking her hand, in his old, affectionate way, " that I had no purpose of bringing you here. I wished for some ladies, to effect certain purposes of my own, and sent my horsemen to catch them;, but your arrest is an accident."' "I believe you, Nat; for I never had reason not to. So kiss me, and let 's make up. Stop! I am to go to the Colonel, am I? That 's the condition!" "Certainly you are." "Well, then," and the old lady exchanged the kiss of peace. "And now how long -  There! I frgot when in the bargain! You may keep me here a week, for aught I know. Ah, boy! how is it?

But now, you young rebel, what do you want of women?" "Will you tell the Colonel and Sir William?" "'Nat! do you suppose I can't keep a secret?" "No; but; I Zwish you to tell them."

Who 'd want to scramble over such a tear-ly-eyes-out thing as that is?" "Well, it is n't finished, and I must finish it. But if I put my men up there to work, they will be shot at from the town." It's likely. You 'chetter not.' "Now I intend that the ladies whom I have sent for shall help." "What! up there?"  "Up there." "Bless my soul, Nathanael! are you in your senses? What do ladies know about such things? ]D' you   THE SIEGE.       443 expect ladies to shovel dirt and chop wood? Besides, they 'll be shot at!  1 Precisely, if you don't prevent it.'  - 'Me? Good gracious!" 6 But you promised you would tell the Colonel." ' To be sure I did." "Well,'tell him that I have not finished my works, but that I shall do it immediately. And when my men are about it, Madam Bray, Madam Page, and Madam Bullard, whom you see yonder with those other ladies, - all of whose husbands are royalists, and in Jamestown, --will be side by side with my men. If, then, the Gov- if Sir William chooses to fire upon us, he can do so."  The old lady lifted her hands and eyes in a4onish- ment, but was silent, and rather grave. She was about to reply, when a volley of fire-armls outside the trenches made her spring, like a young girl, to her feet, and grasp her nephew's arm. "Sit still, aunt! that is, if you like your seat. It is a small patty which ][ have sent out to wake up Sir William." It does not appear, in the annals of the times, what precise method the young General adopted to convey his kinswoman and ambassadress in safety to the town. But that he did so is certain, although she compelled him first to submit in all meekness to a brisk homily on the folly and peril of rebellion, and to an unavailing exhortation to repentance. Soon after she had disappeared through the defences of the town, he gallantly addressed the other ladies, who stood trembling with apprehension, telling them that they had nothing to fear, and should be treated with all    <pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC6802-00000227"/> "4   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. respect. Then, introducing each to an officer, and offering his arm courteously to Madam Bray, he po- litely requested her to accompany him. He was fol- lowed by the officers with their ladies,--who were "mightily astonished at this project," - and all were soon distributed along the unfinished breastxwork. The labor of construction was immediately recom- menced on the whole line. As soon as it was com- pleted, the officers released the ladies from duty, and escorted them to a place of safety. Madam Bacon had undoubtedly delivered her message; for, although Sir William had just planted " three grate guns at a hundred or hundred and fifty paces,' which could have easily torn to pieces the crude works of Bacon, not a shot had been fired "w'hile these Ladyes white Aprons" were visible. "Neather Sir Willian-l nor  the husbands were voide of arnazements at this sub- till invention. If Mr. Fuller thought it strange that the Divell's black gard should. be enrouled God's soul- ders,* they made it no less wonderful that their inno- cent and harmless wives should thus be entred a white garde to the Divell. But this is manifest," adds our old authority, c' that Bacon knit more knots by his owne head in one day, than all the towne was able to untye in a whole weeke." It soon became known to Sir William, that "the Gent: women, Bacon's Gardian   Angles, was, by order, drawne out of danger."  He immediately opened a brief fire from the "three grate guns,"t * Alluding, doubtless, to the graceless rabble whom Sir William, in his straits, had enlisted. t So I understand the words, "after a terable noyse of thunder and lightning out of the Easte."   THE SIEGE.       445  after which he ordered an assault. About seven or eight hundred men, .in good order, and with every show of resolution, marched upon the' int renchments. A steady, well-directed fire brought them to a halt. "A contest of a few minutes " was sufficient for the assailants. Seeing many of their number dead and wounded, they turned suddenly upon their heels, and fled pell-mell within their lines. The Baconians, with loud shouts, leaped from their trenches in pur- suit, but were almost instantly recalled by their Gen- eral, who feared that so sudden .a retreat was but a lure to a snare. Some of Berkeley's officers, it is said, were frantic with vexation, and with tears be- sought their men to 'rally,-which was doubtless 3 true. But it is also recorded, and with equal proba- bility, that, even before the sally, ,' a Cellonell's or a Captain's Commission" would have been sold by those who held thenm " for a chunke of a pipe." Even in Accomac, where no insurrectionary spirit had been manifested, the. Governor had been met with petitions against grievances, instead of offers of service, - in short, with a significant coolness, which, to one in his situation, was both humiliating and dis- tressing. And after he had, " by a sort of miracle,"' captured Bland's armed vessels without; a drop of blood, he was obliged to levy his forces from the very dregs of the people; and even they were brought to his standard only by dazzling promises,--freedom for servants, and plunder and. confiscations for all. Such recruits could not stand before the intrepid ardor of men contending against oppression; and the moment they had tested the stern mettle of the patriots, they had sense enough to perceive, that, if 38    <pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC6802-00000228"/> "6   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. plunder and confiscation did lie in the distance, wounds and death intervened. These they had not bargained' for, and, finding them in the ascendant, declined the adventure. Berkeley had but about twenty men who cherished or could even compre- hend loyalty. He was exceedingly incensed at the cowardice and worthlessness of his followers, yet sternly resolved to brave his enemies to the last. But when, -on the next day, Bacon planted cannon upon his trenches, which he brought to bear both upon the town and vessels, his chivalric resolution passed only for insanity with his cowardly merce- naries, or, at best, for the childish folly of a broken old man. T'Iey began to show symptoms of mutiny. The twenty were willing, if he so decreed, to bury themselves with him in the ruins of the town; yet they frankly told him, that, with such men around  him, a general assault from Bacon - which was con- stantly expected-- would insure a useless and dis- graceful ruin; and that his life and honor might be reserved for bletter auspices. At length the haughty old man bowed his head to the tempest; and, a weekl after Bacon had made his appearance, the royalists silently abandoned the town at midnight, re-embarked, and dropped down the river twenty miles, whenre they came to anchor. When the morning revealed the flight, Bacon, after some precau- tions against a possible ambuscade, took possession of the town. He found the houses stripped of every valu- able, the cannon spiked, and the streets deserted. The position of the fleet indicated an intent to return at any favorable opportunity. News came that Colonel Brent was advancing against the Greneral from the   THE SIEGE.        447 Potomac, at the head of a thousand men. The town - in itself insignificant - must be abandoned, for the purpose of meeting Brent. It would then serve only as a fortress and base of operations for' Sir William. For these reasons, it was resolved to lay it in ashes and on the night of the same day, the smoke and glare and flying cinders of Jamestown announced to the fleet below that it was no longer a hold to be striven for. Two of the best houses were those of Lawrence and Drummond.   Each fired his own. Only the ruined tower of the church, gray with moss and draped with ivy, now marks where Jamestown-- was.'* Bacon now withdrew to Greenspring,- Berkeley's private residence, - where he kept free quarters with his men; partly to give them that rest which they so much needed, and partly to watch the movements of the fleet. The Governor's house was doubtless roughly used -- almost ruined," it was said-by men who had certainly been roughly used by him. They found there household goods of great value, three hundred sheep, seventy horses and mares,-an ample stud, certainly, for the Governor of an impov- erished colony, -and abundant corn and provisions, besides "two great beasts"; none of which his Honor ever saw again.

After two or three days, finding that the fleet had weighed anchor and proceeded again to Accomac, Bacon re- sumed his march. His first business was with those of Gloster Countyy who had not yet taken the'engage- ment agreed upon by the convention at the Middle Plantation.: For this purpose he issued his sum- mons, commanding all the inhabitants to meet him at the court-house on a certain day. While this business was still in progress, one Captain Potter arrived " post-haste '" from ]Rappahannock with infor- :mation that Brent was advancing rapidly. The drums instantly beat to arms, and the General ap- pealed at once to the patriotism of his soldiers: "Will you meet a thousand men resolved to fight you?." He was answered by an enthusiastic shout, and a demand to be led on without delay. This was done. When they had advanced three days, -by easy stages, that they might be fresh for work,---news came that Brent's men had suddenly deserted him; and that he himself -"was mightily astonished, say- ing that they had forsaken the stowwest man, and ruin'd the fairest estate in Verginia." Buct most of them were partisans of Bacon, and the rest had no heart to measure strength with the men who had just- put the Governor himself to flight. And " they being (as they thought) more obliged to looke after their owne concernes and lives, than to take notis, eather of his vallour, or estate, or of their owne cred- its, were not to be rought upon by anything that he could do or say, contrary to their own fancies." The General now returned to meet the Gloster men according to appointment, who appeared to the   THE CATASTROPHE.      449 number of six or seven hundred. They hesitated, but at a second meeting took the engagement. The suc- cess of Bacon was now complete.  The people's rights had been legally restored. The forces of the Indians had been so shattered, and their. courage so completely broken, that they " were never afterwards able to make any firm stand against the whites, and gradually became tributary to them." The Governor had twice fled before the people, and1 had not a foot of land in Virginia on which to stand. Brent's ava- lanche had melted away. Even the temporizing and tenacious royalists of Gloster had peaceably submit- ted. The whole colony was under the authority of the young patriot, who was now planning- an expe, dition to Accornac, the place of the Governor's re- treat. There was a Doctor Pate in Gloster County, whose house had seemed for several days to be an object of attraction, especially to the patriot soldiers. Officers had been seen so often going 'to it and from it as to excite remark. Soon there had appeared sentinels at its avenues of approach, by whom most of the comers had been refused admittance. Then it had been ob- served, for a day or two past, that both officers and 'soldiers who had approached made no other attempt than to exchange a few words with the sentinels, and then to go away with an aspect which indicated sor- row. Sometimes small parties of soldiers had been seen lingering in front of the mansion, and talking in subdued tones, whose gestures and attitudes denoted a deep interest in something pertaining to Dr. Pate's house. No one, during these last days, had had free 38     <pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC6802-00000230"/> 450 . THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. access to the premiises except Dr. Pate himself, Mr. Iawrence, and a Mr. Wading, a clergyman who a short time before had been put under guard by the General for endeavoring to dissuade the people of Gloster from taking the engagement. But during the first day of October the sentinels were withdrawn, save one, who seemed to be retained more for form than for special duty. The house itself had now less of a gloomy aspect, for windows which had been closed and darkened were thrown open, and there were more signs of life and bustle within. But the appearance of the soldiery was far otherwise. From general officer to drummer, they seemed to be suf- fering under some common calamity,-to be over- whelmed, not only with grief, but with consterna- tion. A day or two afte:rwards, there was a gloomy military parade before the mansion; a coffin was brought from the house and laid upon a bier, and men of high rank in the army bore it upon their shoulders to the neighboring church, preceded and followed by the little army itself, with reversed arms and muffled drums. The consecrated house was too small by far for the concourse, and every window was crowded from without by men striving to see and hear the solemnities within. At length the fu- neral chant and the funeral prayer were over, and the coffin was brought out again and carried to the churchyard, and lowered into the grave with the  usual ceremonies of honor. There were strong men there who sobbed, and sunburnt cheeks which were wet with tears; and as the multitude stood there with uncovered heads when the last solemn rite was performed, a stranger might have supposed that each   THE CATASTROPHE.      451 one had lost a father, or a brother, or a bosom friend. And yet-unknown and unsuspected by all but those necessarily privy to the falsehood -- that coffin had been laden only with stones; the mourners had fol- lowed no corpse to the grave. But there was another coffin. It; was very rude, because the hands which shaped it were guided by affection only, and not by skill. And there was an- other funeral, which was very lumble, and other mourners, who were very few; for the last service which they were performing for the dead must be performed by stealth. Teir coffin shrouded a body, -that of Virginia's friend,--the young General of the people, who had been proclaimed an outlaw. They must bury hira in secret; else, shpuld the vin- dictive Governor recover his power, he \vould move heaven and earth to wreak vengeance on the m dn, though dead, who had so withstood his oppressions. He would surely rifle the grave of its tirust, and drag the bones of the patriot from their sanctuary, to dan- gle on the way-side gibbet. Ingram and Lawrence and Drummond would balk the malice of the oppres- sor. The rude coffin had been taken from the house by night. It had been carried, with its sacred treas- ure; far away into the green forest, to a wild, se- cluded spot, where even the hunter rarely if ever strayed, - to a spot which will never be known until the day of the revelation of all things. It was laid upon the ground by its bearers, beneath the branches of the cypress and the oak, just as the sun went down on the day of the unreal funeral at Gloster. The half-score of heavy-hearted friends dug Bacon's grave there with their own hands. Darkness came swiftly    <pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC6802-00000231"/> 452   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. in the depths of the woods ; but the wilderness which gave a grave to the patriot gave also her torch-wood for his obsequies. The grave was finished; the fu- neral service was read; dust was committed to dust; the turf with its adhering coppice was replaced where it had grown; all traces of the work were effaced; and then, beneath the sombre glare of their torches, the soldier-frieiids,-on their lnees, joined hands over the remains of their gallant General, in solemn cove- nant never to reveal the place of his burial.  "No 4Ian knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day."  But Marion! her grief, her secret consolation! what of those? Gentle reader, History tells of heroes and traitors, but not of widow's tears.  God treasures those. The welfare of the whole colony had long been depending upon the sagacity, watchfulness, and en- ergy of their General.  The load had been thrown upon him  suddenly. He had accepted it.  He had borne it, too, under circumstances the most trying, both to his moral susceptibilities and his bodily pow- ers. His own words affectingly describe the corrod- ing indignation of an honorable mind, conscious of its integrity: "It vexes me to the heart, that, while we are hunting wolves, tigers, and bears, that daily destroy our harmless sheep and lambs, we are pur- sued with full cry, as more savage beasts." ])uring * The critical reader may, perhaps, indulge my supposition of a false funeral of General Bacon; for, dying as he did in the middle of his army, it would seem to have been necessary to prevent all traces of the real one; and, besides, it seems to be indicated--faintly, to be sure- by the very peculiar language of T. M., p. 24, in Force, Vol. I.   THE CATASTROPHE.      453 all this time he had' had all the responsibility and personal care of the country's affairs, both in the wil- derness and in the- settlements; for although he had his lieutenants in the several counties, upon whom he laid important local trusts, yet of none did he ever divest himself. On his various exhausting marches from the York River to the Roanoke, and during all. his hours of watching and fighting, he had been con- stantly anxious and constantly directing for the secur- ity of the interior. And no sooner .had he returned thither, than he gave himself assiduously and without rest to the personal inspection of every military posi- tion, alid to the yet more arduous work of sustaining the unity and confidence of the people. 'In all his marches and countermarches, he had shared danger and fatigue with the meanest soldier. lHe had borne at once the hardships, of a private, the care and anxie- ties of a general, and the burdens of a magistrate. He had hardly begun to breathe after his return from the banks of the Roanoke, before he was working in the trenches at Jamestown, and sleeping night after night, and unsheltered, upon the swampy ground. To those more immediately about his person. it had for some time been evident that these things were undermining his strength. Still his zeal, his courage, and his toil had continued unabated. But at length fatigue, care, -and exposure had induced a virulent disorder of the bowels, under which nature had yielded. Through the whole of his remarkable public course, he had been governed by no mercenary or ambitious motives. Not rashly and in a fit of passion, but de- liberately, hesitatingly, reluctantly even, he had been    <pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC6802-00000232"/> 454   THE YOU;H OF THE OLD DOMNION. persuaded to move, without official sanction, in de- fence of the frontiers. All his aggressive proceed- ings had been against the Indians. His attack upon Jamestown, and its destructiont had been strictly de- fensive operations. He had never manifested rancor against the Governor's person, nor a wish to usurp or even to supersede his authority, until Sir William's own conduct rendered the latter necessary to prevent a state of anarchy. He had staked his life, his for- tune, and his good name, and had sought no immu- nities but for the people. With a devoted soldiery at his command, he had been guilty of no excesses, even when flushed with success and tempted by the great- est provocations. He was ever careful of shedding Christian blood,--in this respect a perfect contrast to Sir William Berkeley. At the time when the lattei was driven from the Middle Plantation, a spy had been detected in Bacon's camp, who had repeatedly deserted from party to party. He had been tried by court-martial, and condemned to death. Bacon pub- licly offered, that, if any one man in the army would speak but one word in his'behalf, he should be saved; and it was not until there was no hope of an inter- cessor that he was executed,- the only instance in which the young General took life, save what, was unavoidable in the heat and hurry of battle. When Berkeley captured Bland and his vessels, he had pro- ceeded instantly to the work of vengeance; directly hanging Captain Carver, one of Bland's men who had gallantly " resolved," as he said, "to adventure his old bones against the Indian rogues," and reserv- ing Bland and others in irons for a like fate. When the news of this cold-blooded execution was received   THE CATASTROPHE.      455 by Bacon, Sir Henry Chichely, thY Lieutenant-Gov- ernor of the crown, was a prisoner. A word from Bacon, and it would have been the knight's life for Carvers, - a decree which Sir Henry expected, in reprisal for what he himself " exclaimed against as a most rash and wicked act of the Governor.' But the young patriot had not so learned patriotism as to re- venge upon Chichely the sin and barbarity of Berke- ley. Such had been the temperate and humane course of a successful military leader with all power in his hands; a course rarely, if ever, equalled under like circumstances and provocations. Happy was it for him, that he could take such a review of the past, when, in the flood-tide of his fortunes, his spirit was suddenly called to give account for its deeds in the body.      <pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC6802-00000233"/> CH  PALPTEIR XXVII. IEVENGE. THE spider sat in his Accomac cell. He could now shoot out his webs over the whole Chesapeake and its tributaries, in whatever direction the wind would waft them. - The besom which had so long been sweeping down his toils- the head, the heart, the right-arm of the insurrection-was gone. More than a month since poor old Captain Carver was netted! He would spin another thread and float it forth; for he was hungry,- very hun- gry: it might entangle something. He did so, and the wind bore the messenger across the Bay to York River. It caught upon the house of one.

They were brought over to' Accomac, of course. The twenty common ones " were committed to prison," notwithstanding " the justifiers" of Sir Wil- liam Berkeley averred afterwards that he hung folks because "he had no place of strength to secure them." The prime one was for sacrifice. A court- martial quickly arranged that matter. There was a   REVENGE.        457 little time of grace granted him in his prison. For only one thing did he pray to his judges; "that 'he nmight be shot like a soldier, and not be hanged like a dog." This being denied him, he at once shut his eyes and heart to the world, and betookI himself in his cell to other prayer, in which he hadi,' an Advo- cate with the Father."'  Having thus intrusted his soul, with confession and contrition, he went to meet the sentence of those who only have power to kill the body, 1 ; Takel notice," said he to the crowd before the gallows; "on the list of my sins before God, rebel- lion ing written. I die a loyal subject and a loveri of .my country. I have never taken up arms but for the destruction of the Indians, the nurderers of so many Christians." The youthful patriot was swung off, "the first Vir- ginian borne that dyed upon a paire of Gallows." This was on the 13th of November. Sir William Berkeley began to breathe. Such suc- cess, on the first effort, was encouraging; and no sooner had Major Beverly, the knight's purveyor,-- "a parson calculated to. the Latitude of the sarvis,"- ' delivered his fraight at Accomac," thuaLn he was off upon another hunt. There was a little passage-at- arms upon this cccasion ; but Beverly succeeded, and, brought back to his master Captain Farlow, Captain Wilford, Major, Cheeseman, and fivV or six others. r Wilford was a dapper little fellow, but he 'had a stout heart, and, in the matter of bearing arms, a clear conscience; so he could afford to meet Sir William's vengeance coolly. He had just lost an eye in the skirmish in which he was captured; " but if I 89    <pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC6802-00000234"/> 458   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. were stark blind," said he, knowing hee Governor's humor for hanging, ' lhe would be sure to furnish me a guide to the gallows, for he promised it to me long ago for going with the General against the Indians without a commission." "What made you serve under the rebel Bacon?" asked Berkeley of Cheeseman. "May it please your Honor," said the prisoner's young and loving wife, giving him no time to reply, "I made him." "You!" and Sir William eyed her keenly. "Yes, your Honor, it was through my means. I proposed it. I urged it. I provoked hilm to it. He never would have done it but for me. I do therefore beseech your Honor -- and she threw herself upon her knees- "that the punishment miy fall where it belongs,- on the most guilty. The tempted may find grace, but not the tempter. Let him be spared. Send me to the gallows in his stead." The beauty, the youth, the imploring attitude, the self-devotion, the plea, the earnest, tremulous, tearful face of the petitioner, drew from the Governor.--a parley? a relenting doubt? a pardon? No. Even an intercession so noble, so touching, could not move him to pity or to admiration. He Was iron. He was savage. He was aristocratic. He was Sir William Berkeley. He knew that what she said was truth. But he also saw that, in throttling the husband, he should crush the wife. He could have two victims.

Chleeseman soon died, to be sure, and he died a victim,--his life wrung out of him by hard usage n and want i his dungeon; but both were spared the ignominy of his public strangling. Farlow died as Wilford did, and so died the five or six others. Sir William Berkeley had breathed. He now took heart. - He was so animated by these oblations, that he ventured across the Bay himself, chuckling in an- ticipation of what his own presence, would achieve. He did not venture on shore yet, buit cast anchor in a good offing at Tindell's Point, and sent others ashore. But the fortune of war was against them. The first thing which happened was, that '": thirty 'men and boys," at Colonel Bacon's house, routed " a hundred and twenty " men-soldiers whom his Honor sent against them. He sent out Major Ladwrence Smnith, too, with six hundred men against Ingram, Bacon's successor. The Major ran away, and his men were taken prisoners; but Ingram generously dismissed them to their own homes. A party if the patriots, to be sure, had been taken prisoners on the south side of James River; but here,. on the. York, they were knocking the royalists about like ninepins. Under these discouraging circumstances, the Governor be- thought himself of a new policy. He would stoop a little, and try the effect of fair words and promises. So he wrote several very courteous. and even flatter- ing letters to Walklate, an associate general with Ingram, proposing to both a negotiation for peace,- carefully keeping himself, on shipboard still. The overture was opportunely made. The people were    <pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC6802-00000235"/> "O   THE YOUTH OF THIE OLD DOMUNION. weary of a strife which 1had so long interfered with their industrial pursuits; for their fields 'had been necessarily neglected and their crops curtailed. The supplies for the soldiery could be obtained only by arbitrary levies, for whichl each party plundered the other as occasion required or opportunity offered. The controlling mind, the mloral :influence, and the  sound, effective eloquence, of Bacon were wanting. Upon his successors the public mind could not rest with the confidence which is necessary to unity, en- ergy, avid progress. It would seem, too, that these officers had come to distrust their own. position; fear- ing that, by a dissatisfied people or by aspiring rivals, they might be displaced. Thus, we say, it was a favorable time for Beirkeley to proffer compromise. To Ingram, WalllaLte, and Langstone, another prom-  inent leader, he oflberped a full pardon, without any fine or other pun'ishment; they to restore all plunder which they had taken from the Indians or the Eng- lish. To these terms they readily agreed. But it was necessary tihat the soldiers should be reconciled.  To this end, Captain Grantham, who had been the Governor's medium of negotiation, and who, the sol- diers were given to understand, was a friend to their cause, arranged fol a mediatorial interview. he was received with respect, and proposed their- surrender to the authority of the Governor on the following condi- tions: -1.

IThus Berkeley recovered his supremacy, and the insurrection vas at an end. The stipulations were performed on the part of the' patriot officers and soldiers.

This was the first step of his Honor.  The second was openly and practically to repudiate his own soleran promise of general amnesty, juist so far as caprice, or personal pique, or covetousness might dictate. As soon as the staff was in his own hands, the order of the day was fines, confiscations, and strangling. A court-martial was held on shipboard-  -67 where Sir William  still remained---on the l11th of January, and four men were summarily con- demned and executed.

Nothing could have been more gratifying; for he had long had a special " rancor " against Drummond, con- sidering  ' tile Scotchman the originall cause of the whole rebellion,~ - on what grounds, other than his pretensions in common with others for the public good, does not appear, for he had never borne arms. Sir William, under the excitement of this capture, now ventured for the first time ashore, and with a mock bow accosted hlis new victim. " Mr. Drummond! you are very welcome. I am more glad to see you than any man in 'Virginia. Mr. Drummond! you shall be hanged in half an hour." ' What your Honor pleases," coolly replied Drum- mond, and the interview closed.

But he has answered to it before this!" There were very, very few, throughout the whole colony, who had not been implicated, directly or indi- rectly, in the insurrection; hardly a man who -was not thus obnoxious to' the Governor's vengeance; hardly a man who did not live in daily trembling lest he- should be a rraigned; hardly a man who did hot cast about in his mind for some means of escap- ing from a country which bade fair to become a UGol- gothaA.

Now, a none escaped being found guilty, condemned, and hanged, that put themselves on trial"; and so it soon came, to pass, that this question was always proposed to the person arraigned,--" Vill you be tried, or will you. be fined at the discretion of the court?"  The unfortunate man, recurring to the uniform fate of his predecessois, and perceiving that there was no hope through a trial, would discreetly choose to be fined;  thus buying his life by sacrificing his estate.

They brought with them a royal act of grace and forgiveness for all but Bacon.  This, to. gether with their own commission and 'instructionis, they immediately delivered, urging Sir William to publish forthwith the king's proclamation of. grace, that the distracted people might be quieted.

Hanging was yet in vogue, notwithstanding the royal decree of grace. Bland, who had beeni choicely reserved in chains ever since he was entrapped at Accomac, was at last brought up for judgment.  He pleaded' that Sir William Berkeley had at that moment his pardon, with the royal signature, in his pocket; and he had, - a spe- cial pardon procured by Bland's friends in England. But he was found guilty, and hung.

They received complaints only on testimony of credible, loyal, sober persons, moderate, disinterested men, whom they enjoined to testify "'in such sort as might become dutiful subjects, and sober, rational men "; and yet, " even with this caution, the num- ber, variety, and enormity of those charges which were supported astonished them, and they were at a loss to reconcile this assemblage of odious vices with the received reputation of Sir William Berke- ley."

It was the last which wVas seen or heard of this accomplished and high-minded man.  Sir William Berkeley, leaving the government of Virginia in the hands of Colonel Herbert Jeffries, who had been commissioned by the King, sailed for Eng- land late in the month of April. Upon his arrival, he  found that 1he odor of his cruelties had preceded him. The commissioners had reported in reprobation of his conduct, and it was regarded with horror both by the King and his Council. "The old fool," said ' Charles the Second, indignantly, "has hanged more men in that naked country than I have for the mur- der of my father." Under such reprobation, - ap- proved doubtless by the voice of his own conscience, --the hoary executioner of men who had only de- fended their firesides and resented oppression, gave way; and in July of the same year he sunk into a dishonored grave. So disappeared the actors in this brief but memora- ble drama. In what were the people bettered? They had over- awed the savages, but their own choice men were gone. Their persecitor was gone also, but his power to tyran- nize was transferred unabated to others. The amelio-y rating laws of the patriot Assembly--"Bacon's laws" they were called -were repealed. But the liberal Charter for which agents had been se nt to England in 1675, what of that?

In its stead, the King issued troops and a paltry patent, which related chiefly to the judicial powers of the Colonial Council and the security of land-titles, but making no recognition of the Assembly. By sepa- rate instructions, that. body was indeed- permitted, during the royal pleasure,,;' but it was to be called only once in two years, and then was to continue in session only fourteen days.  The right of electing Burgesses was taken from all but freeholders. The aristocracy of Virginia was reinstated on the backs of the people. The punishments which had been inflicted 'by Berkeley were terrors' not- soon to be forgotten; and they effectually stifled all murmurs against.the return of old, and' now aggravated., griev- ances. Unequal and burdensome taxes were revived; they were fearfully increased 'by the expenses of the insurrection; they were collected by men whose vo- cation it was to extort, and whose emolument it was to defraud. They were so laid - by poll - that tle poor man, 'paying as much as the rich man, was crushed under a burden which he could not lessen, because he could not vote. Once more Virginia was  REVENGE,         469 under the heel of pitiless power, - of power respolsi- ble only to a distant monarch, who lolled in the laps of courtesans, and flung thoughtlessly to titled beg- gars the rights and properties of thousads, for a new beauty or a purse of gold. How, then, was Virginia bettered, by her struggle against oppression? To overawe her spirits, an armed force had been imposed upon her soil and billeted upon her citizens, and was not disbanded until 1682. The Navigation Act, enforced by a frig- ate ruiser in, their waters, still kept the people por'; the doubling of the Governor's salary, upon the aLc- cesion of Culpepper in 1680, besides, his bonus for house-rent and his perquisites, made them poorer; his unblushing rapacity and inventive extortion made thieml poorer still, until tobacco fell to a penny a' pound, the people lacked the common necessaries of life, and it was thought necessary, in 13682, to curb their starving restlessness by new executions on the gallows. The grants to Arlington and Culpepper were not annulled until 1684, when Virginia, again became a province of the Crown.   Still the system of exaction and oppression went on, and was unmit'i- gated.  Colonial office was sought by profligate cour- tiers, only for the sake of making money; and the British nobleman, too proud and too lazy for honest trade; could stoop to wring from his storehouse the hard earnings ;of the planter, to defraud, the hireling soldier of his -wages, to extort exorbitant and even arbitrary fees, and to haggle with his ow-\n clerks for a share in their perquisites of office. Not Culpepper only, but his successor, Effingham, and his successors, were taskmasters arid pickpockets to the planter, 40 f,'     <pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC6802-00000240"/> 470   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOMNION. while the Crown made him a tributary to the trades- man and artificer of London. What did God give England colonies for? To enrich her merchants and her nobles, to be sure! The profit of England was -the colonist's chie f end. He was made for it. He could conduce to it. He must work for it. Such, from the beginning, were the axioms of the mother country, and they were maintained for a century longer, until Virginia, with her sister colonies, had disbursed her wealth, and poured out her blood like water, in loyalty to the Crown; until, impoverished and depleted as she was, she drew the sword upon tyranny, and flung the scabbard away. And the struggle of Bacon and his peers was boot- less? Not so. The leaven which they had infused remained. It was hidden, but it wrought. The tyranny which sought to suppress, only diffused it. Even the aristocratic class became affected, and the royalist Burgesses kicked against the goads, even be- fore Bacon had lain in his unknownl grave a year; and again in 1681; and yet again in 1685, so vigor- ously, that James the Second told them to stop " their unnecessary debates, their unquiet dispositions, and their tumultuous proceedings"; and even alarm- ingly did they repeat their behavior in 1688. The chains not only cut deep into the flesh of the poor, but began to chafe the rich; and they who could savor their banquet with the oil and olives of the Mediterranean, the sugar and the coffee of San Do- mingo, and the choice wines of Southern' Europe, 'rgumbled at the convivial board about the overbear- ing encroachments of the Crown. Bacon's move- ment had indeed taught Virginia a lesson of ven-                    . '   REVENGE.    -    471 geance which she long remembered with horror ; but  it had also given her a relish and a passion for civil freedom which she never lost. If we estimate the events of 1676 only by their immediate results, we err. Their influence did not perish in a' day. - Every now and then its hidden presence and strength were shown by the bubbling upon the waters:, all alongthe lapse of, years while the Stuarts were passing away, and the childless Prince of Orange, and the parri- cide Anne, and the first and second Georges. The generation taught, for so short a time only, by the youthful patriot to resent and to resist oppression, transmitted their temper with their blood. Not that Virginia had not before been jealous of arbitrary rule. She had long been, and it has been our pleasure to record it. But not until 1676 had she riseen up. The babe first balancing upon its- feet may fall, and its mishap may make it timid; but it; never forgets its discovered power: it yearns for its exercise, until it can run alone. An intelligent review of the early history of Vir- ginia cannot be made ,wtvhout enthusiastic admira- tion. It may be questione whether that meed ,of honor has yet been rendered to her which is her due. The profligacy and worthlessness of her pioneer set- tlers, with the exception of a few rare and devoted men,-- Smith, and Hunt, and Gosnold, and Percy, -- are seldom equalled, never surpassed. But their de- ipravity was their bane. They were but the menial scouts, not the fathers, of the new commonwealth; and when they had done their drudgery, they died. Hardier and better men entered into their labors --    <pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC6802-00000241"/> 472   THE YOUTH OF THE OLD DOM:iNION. men who loved the broad wilderness and virgin Na- ture, not for licentiousness' sake, but for that sense of manhood and healthful freedom which they give; who breathed an untainted air with delight, yet deferred to civil rule as salutary. The alphabet of self-government Was, indeed, sent to Virginia by her fosterers in England, who might not use it there themselves. The New World had given her a new instinct; and she learned so rapidly to read and write, that she outstripped her patrons, and first framed a Bill of Rights. That which the British Parliam'ent extorted from Charles the First, which historians have venerated and lauded as the original charter of cot stitutional liberty, was but the successor and the tran- script of Virginia's in 1624. Nor was this the only memorable instance in which the aged mother was fain to learn wisdom from the despised and youthful daughter. In 1688, when England was at her wit's end to reconcile her fundamental doctrine of heredi- tary succession. with her craving for a new dynasty; when she had scared Jtames the Second to France; when she was at the crisis of her glorious Revolu- tion,-glorious in its results, though infamous in its prosecution, -she piously compromised with her con- science, her will, and, haer constitutiotn, and cunningly- cut the knot which she could not untie, by declaring that her legitimate monarch uwas not, while he was yet alive and claimed allegiance,-- that her realm was kingless, - that flight was abdication. Whether absurd or rational, whether a truth or a lie, was not essential. It was gravely adopted by the Conven- tion of 1688-9 ; for it suited their purpose, it resolved their perplexity. Were they sages above all others? :\   REVENGE.       .7 473 Although it was a figment, a trick upon common sense, it was an admirable expedient for a worthy end. But they did not originate it: Virginia did. Twelve years before, she had done it. When Berke- ley had been scared to Accomac, she had declared that flight was abdication." England availed her- self; of so shrewd a precedent, -for James in Francee was like Berkeley in Accomac, - and demurely avowed a notion for which she had chastised her daughter. 'Would she, of herself, have divined so odd a doctrine? - Honor to whom honor.' But Virginia was not only the first tTpropound to England a Petition of Right, and the first to show her how she might make a Revolution. She was the first to tell her bluntly, that tyranny would not do for Anglo-Saxons in America; the first to draw the sword of Liberty, and the first to furnish martyrs. The elder sister of the Colonies, she had sustained the dignity of her birthright. It was meet, therefore that by her it should first be "proposed" that the Congress of the Colonies should declai'e their inde- pendence. It was meet that by a son of her's that Declaration should be drawn; that from, her should arise the Father of the Country, the first chief magis- trate of the new republic. Ald it was also meet that on her soil, where revolution was first attempted, the grand drama of triuvmphant Revolution should be closed; that where the first blow had been struck for Freedom, there, a century after, should be struck the last; that, on the very spot where Drummond was martyred on the gallows, Cornwallis should surrender to Washington. So God orders. THE END.     </p>
