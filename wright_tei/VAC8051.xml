               <p>Not in the orilliantly illuminated ball-room—nor in the elegant mansion of
                  aristocracy and wealth—nor in the gilded saloon of rashionable dissipation—nor yet
                  in the squalid abode of poverty and vice—is the opening scene of our story
                  laid.</p>
               <p>But within the gloomy walls of a Philadelphia prison—that stern and terrible
                  institution, rendered necessary, of the vices of humanity, to the preservation of
                  social order, and to the prevalence of equal and exact justice among men.</p>
               <p>Let us traverse, with echoing footsteps, this dark corridor;—we pause before a
                  massive iron door, and, through a narrow aperture, we are enabled to view the
                  interior of the cell.</p>
               <p>Its sole inmate is a youth of rare personal beauty, possessing a form slender and
                  graceful, yet vigorous, and a faultless countenance, full of expression and
                  fire.</p>
               <p>It is the young Outlaw, who has been committed to await his trial for one of the
                  most daring and extensive bank burglaries upon the annais of crime—an affair in
                  which his accomplice, known as the "<hi rend="i"/>Ribber," was killed by one of
                  the officers of justice.</p>
               <p>This prisoner is the celebrated Jack Harold; he is examining with intense
                  satisfaction, the tools which have been conveyed to him by the mysterious old man
                  who calls himself the "Wandering Jew."</p>
               <p>Suddenly the prisoner starts to his feet, his countenance radiant with joy; for,
                  by the aid of these tools, he hopes to gain his liberty, and the hope inspires him
                  with unusual strength, as he resolutely attacks the heavy iron bars at the window
                  of his cell.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Perhaps there can be no stronger motive in the world, to urge a man to industrious
                  activity, than a desire to accomplish his release from imprisonment. So, at least,
                  thought the young Outlaw, as he vigorously worked upon the iron window bars with
                  his sharp tools; while thoughts of freedom nerved him to the laborious task.</p>
               <p>By noon he had made considerable progress; and he then desisted from his toil,
                  knowing that the turnkey would soon appear with his dinner. The deep cuts which he
                  had made in the bars, he filled up with a black <unclear>pus-</unclear>
                  <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8051-00000003"/> ty-like substance with which he had been
                  provided; so that it would require a very close inspection in order to observe the
                  marks of the tools.</p>
               <p>He had just completed every arrangement calculated to avert suspicion, when the
                  cell door was opened, and the turnkey entered with his dinner, consisting of an
                  abundance of coarse but wholesome food.</p>
               <p>"Your trial will come on to-morrow," remarked the turnkey, as he placed the repast
                  upon the table.</p>
               <p>"Indeed! 'Tis is sooner than I expected," said the prisoner, with an air of
                  indifference—"I wonder what the devil they will do with me—come, sir; you have
                  some experience in such matters; what sort of a sentence do you suppose I will
                  receive?"</p>
               <p>"Why, to tell you the truth, Jack," was the turnkey's reply—"I don't think you'll
                  get a moment less than fifteen years!"</p>
               <p>"Well, there's no help for it," was the prisoner's philosophical
                  rejoinder—"there's no use in mourning over spilled milk; and those who dance must
                  pay the fiddler—two capital maxims which are infernally consoling."</p>
               <p>"Just so," said the knight of the keys, who was a good-natured fellow, and
                  disposed to be somewhat communicative—notwithstanding which, he was a most
                  vigilant officer—"just so. But I must not forget to mention one thing to you,
                  Jack. The head keeper of the jail, who lives next door that's his house, right
                  under your window—is going to give a grand <emph>blow out</emph> tonight to his
                  friends, in honor of his daughter's birth-day. There will be dancing, and music,
                  and singing, and drinking; and I shouldn't wonder if the noise kept you awake all
                  night. I am invited to be present; we intend to keep it up all night, and get as
                  drunk as owls."</p>
               <p>"Well, I hope you may enjoy yourself. I shall not mind the noise," said the
                  prisoner; and the turnkey took his departure.</p>
               <p>"This is d—d unlucky," thought Jack, when he was left alone—"I shall be obliged to
                  pass through the head jailor's house, in order to reach the street. The house will
                  be full of company, and it is ten chances to one that I will be noticed and
                  arrested. However, I must risk it, for I dare not postpone my escape until
                  to-morrow night, as my trial comes on to-morrow; and I am aware that immediately
                  after the conviction of a prisoner he is sentenced and conveyed to the place
                  destined for his imprisonment, without being returned to this jail. To-night I
                  must escape from this place, or never!"</p>
               <p>He hastily despatched his dinner, and then resumed his work upon the window bars.
                  During the whole of that afternoon he toiled with untiring industry, and by supper
                  time he felt that three hours' additional exertion wold suffice to accomplish his
                  object.</p>
               <p>Again he filled up the deep crevices in the iron bars with the black substance.
                  The turnkey entered with his supper, and having placed it upon the table, he
                  advanced to the window, as was his custom every evening, for the purpose of
                  satisfying himself that the prisoner had not been tampering with the stout grating
                  which opposed his exit.</p>
               <p>Something peculiar in the appearance and movements of the turnkey, attracted
                  Jack's notice; and he soon perceived that the worthy jail functionary had been
                  anticipating the approaching festivities of the night, by getting tolerably well
                  drunk.</p>
               <p>This was a very fortunate circumstance for our hero; for the oblivious condition
                  of the turnkey greatly diminished the probability of his discovering the marks of
                  the tools upon the bars of the window.</p>
               <p>"All right, my boy!" he exclaimed, after a brief examination—"I was a little
                  af-afraid that you'd g-give me the<unclear>slip,</unclear> b-but you ca-ca-can't
                  do it <emph>now</emph>—hic!—be-because after to-night y-y-you won't be under
                     <emph>my</emph> ch-ch-charge! Tomorrow night—hic!—you'll lodge in the Eastern
                  Pen-pen-i-ten-ten-tiary!"</p>
               <p>"I wish," said Jack, laughing—that you would honor me with an invitation to the
                  party which the head jailor gives to-night, in celebration of his daughter's
                  birth-day."</p>
               <p>The turnkey burst into a roar of laughter at the exquisite joke, and stammered
                  forth—</p>
               <p>"So I <emph>would</emph> invite you, my boy, if I wasn't af-afraid that you
                  couldn't come—ha, ha, ha! You might be com-compelied to stay at home, you know—ha,
                  ha, ha! Your kind f-f-friends might object to your going out to spend the evening
                  be-because you might for-for-forget to come back—ha, ha, ha! No, Jack; I don't
                  think that you'll have the—hic!—pleasure of drinking to-night to the health of the
                  jailor's l-l-lovely daughter—the pretty Nell Douglass!"</p>
               <p>"Well," said Jack, demurely—"if you don't invite me, I shall invite myself.
                  Remember, I shall be present at the party to-night, and drink to the health of the
                  pretty Nell Douglass."</p>
               <p>At this the turnkey laughed louder than ever; and he swore that Captain Douglass,
                  the head jailer, should be informed of the excellent joke.</p>
               <p>"You're a funny fellow, Jack," said the turnkey, on taking his leave—"I'm so-sorry
                  that you've go-got into this bad scrape, which will—hic!—be sure to shut you up in
                  the stone house for fif-teen years! Ah, well, poor fellow; you'll be sure to come
                  to the party to-night; you won't disappoint your friends; oh, no! of course not!
                  not by any means—ha, ha, ha! I shall be—hic!—sure to expect you—over the left! I
                  so-say, Jack, just tell us at what time you're coming, so that we can nave
                  something ready for you, to eat and drink; something nice and warm, you know—ho,
                  ho ho!"</p>
               <p>The humorous turnkey narrowly escaped going into convulsions at his own
                  facetiousness. Jack merely remarked to him, as he closed the cell door—</p>
               <p>"I shall look in and see you at about twelve o'clock!"</p>
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho!" roared the other, as he turned the key in
                  the lockand took himself off.</p>
               <p>Left once more to himself, our hero again went to work upon the bars. As he
                  industriously plied his tools, sounds of boisterous merriment indicated that the
                  festivities of the night had commenced.</p>
               <p>The clock in a neighboring church steeple struck ten, just as Jack had cut through
                  the last bar which offered an obstacle to his escape.</p>
               <p>"Thanks to thee, old gray-beard Jew! he muttered—"ere day-break I shall again
                  stand within thy mysterious abode!"</p>
               <p>Tearing his blankets into strips, he formed a rope of a length and strength
                  sufficient to enable him to descend to the roof of the jailor's house, which was
                  about twenty feet below the window of his cell. It was eleven o'clock when he
                  completed this task.</p>
               <p>"I will wait another hour," thought he—"by that time the male guests, at least,
                  will probably be somewhat intoxicated, and I shall enjoy a better opportunity of
                  showing the company that some things can be done as well as others!"</p>
               <p>The midnight hour arrived, and our young Outlaw prepared to prosecute his daring
                  enterprise.</p>
               <p>Having firmly attached one end of his rope to the iron bed-stead, he lowered the
                  other end out of the window; and then, by the friendly aid of this simple
                  contrivance, he descended in safety to the roof of the jailor's house.</p>
               <p>The roof being very nearly flat, he was enabled to walk upon it without danger.
                  Discovering a sort of cupola, furnished with windows and a door, he<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000004"/> approached it and to his joy found that the door
                  was unfastened.</p>
               <p>Without a moment's hesitation, he descended the stairs leading into the building.
                  The deepest darkness reigned; yet he could hear the noise and loud shouts of
                  laughter which issued from the apartment wherein the guests of the head jailor
                  were assembled.</p>
               <p>Groping his way with the utmost caution, he passed down another flight of stairs;
                  and paused before the door of a room in which he knew the company to be at
                  supper—ample evidence of the fact being furnished by the clattering of plates and
                  glasses, to say nothing of the peculiar "pop—phiz—gurgle!" produced by the
                  extraction of corks from bottles of champagne.</p>
               <p>Our hero peeped through the keyhole, and had a good view of everything inside. The
                  apartment was large, and decently but not expensively furnished. Around a large
                  table, which was spread with the materials of an excellent supper, were seated
                  about a dozen gentlemen and as many ladies—all persons of respectable appearance,
                  evidently not of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon ton,</foreign> but belonging to
                  the middle class of society.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">TERRIBLE EVENTS.</head>
               <p>Captain Douglass, the governor of the jail, was seated at the head of the table.
                  He was a thick-set, powerfully-built man, apparently about forty-five years of
                  age; the expression of his countenance was severe, although a sort of disdainful
                  smile seemed to be almost continually lingering upon his lips. Now and then he
                  would turn towards a young girl who was seated next to him; and on such occasions
                  the scornful look would instantly vanish from his face, to give place to an
                  expression of the most doting fondness. This young girl was the head jailor's only
                  daughter; and his affection for her was the only redeeming trait in his
                  character—for he was a most violent, unprincipled, selfish man; and to the poor
                  prisoners under his care, he was a tyrant.</p>
               <p>His daughter, Nell Douglass—in honor of whose seventeenth birth-day this feast was
                  given—was a very pretty, lively, animated girl, with laughing blue eyes, which,
                  joined to the dazzling fairness of her complexion, gave a He-be-like youth to her
                  features and expression. Whenever she smiled, she exhibited a brilliant set of
                  teeth; and therefore, of course, she took good care to smile very often.</p>
               <p>At her side was seated the turnkey, who had been so amused at Jack Harold's
                  self-invitation to the party. He was evidently an admirer of the pretty Nell, and
                  extremely desirous of initiating himself into her good graces; but, she, being a
                  coquette, took very little notice of the poor fellow, whose eyes sparkled with the
                  combined fires of love, jealousy and wine.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, whose name, by the way, was Rimser, was one of those easy,
                  good-natured, smooth-going fellows, who, while they pass through life without
                  attracting notice, also glide down life's stream without making enemies. Although,
                  as a turnkey in the jail, he was vigilant, and faithful to the authorities who
                  employed him, he was nevertheless invariably kind to poor prisoners, to the great
                  disapprobation of the stern head jailor, who often rebuked his subordinate for not
                  treating the inmates of the jail with a sufficient degree of vigor and
                  severity</p>
               <p>In her own heart, the fair Nell Douglass was favorably inclined towar is the
                  good-looking turnkey, although, in a spirit of malicious coquetry, she had point
                  blank refused to marry him, and affected not to care for him the value of a brass
                  button.</p>
               <p>As for Captain Douglass, he had, on hearing of Mr. Rimser's offer of marriage to
                  his daughter, thus addressed him:—"You want my Nell for a wife, sir; you can't
                  have her. I'll tell you why; you're too chicken-hearted to enter the Douglass
                  family. There's too much of the lamb, and too little of the bull-dog about you, to
                  suit me for a son-in-law. Get rid of your milk of human kindness, learn to be
                  savage and rough, treat all prisoners like brutes, and then come and ask my
                  consent to marry Nell; not until then!"</p>
               <p>But Mr. Rimser, as much as he loved the gruff tyrant's daughter, would not steel
                  his heart against the unfortunate, even for the sake of gaining her hand.</p>
               <p>All honor to the man who refuses to check the generous impulses of his soul, even
                  at the expense of sacrificing his dearest and most cherished wishes!</p>
               <p>Mr. Rimser, although somewhat elevated with wine, was not half so much intoxicated
                  as when he had carried our hero his supper; for the hearty repast which he had
                  eaten, in a great measure prevented the fumes of exhilarating beverages from
                  ascending to his brain. This circumstance will account for the coherence of his
                  speech, during the conversation which follows.</p>
               <p>And every word of that conversation was distinctly audible to Jack, who stood
                  listening at the door.</p>
               <p>"By the way, Captain Douglass," suddenly exclaimed Mr. Rimser, who had just looked
                  at his watch and found It was half past twelve o'clock—"I've got something to tell
                  you which will make you laugh. You remember the young fellow whom we've now got in
                  jail, and who gives his name as Jack Harold—"</p>
               <p>"Yes," growled the Captain—"the young scoundrel whose trial comes on to-morrow for
                  attempting to rob the Bank of Mammon. His partner was killed, and it served him
                  right, damn him! Pity this Harold hadn't been killed too; however he'll be hung
                  some day, and that's some comfort—What of him?"</p>
               <p>"Ever that infernal prophecy—<emph>hung! hung! hung!</emph>"—muttered our hero,
                  grinding his teeth with an intensity of agony produced by mingled rage and fears
                  for the future.</p>
               <p>"You shall hear," said Mr. Rimser. "This evening when I carried him his supper, I
                  chanced to mention to him that you were going to give a party tonight in honor of
                  Miss Nell's birthday; whereupon Jack remarked, as cool as a cucumber, that he
                  would look in and see us at about twelve o'clock, and drink the health of the
                  pretty Nell Douglass. It's now half past twelve, and I hardly think that he'll
                  keep his appointment—ha, ha, ha!"</p>
               <p>Every one seated at the table joined in the laugh, with the exception of Captain
                  Douglass, upon whose stern countenance there gathered a dark frown.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said he—"the young rascal's words may contain a deeper meaning than any
                  of you imagine.—Rimser, you have treated him with too much indulgence. You should
                  have fed him on bread and water, and allowed him no bed; the stone floor is good
                  enough for him. More than this, sir, you should have placed him in irons. Why the
                  devil did you neglect to do it, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I had no orders to that effect," replied the turnkey, with some show of
                  indignation—" I didn't consider that such harsh treatment was at all necessary.
                  What need is there of exercising cruelty towards a prisoner, as long as his
                  security is provided for?"</p>
               <p>"Silence, sir!" thundered the head jailor—"how dare you question me? Be careful,
                  or you may chance to lose your situation. Did you this evening carefully examine
                  this fellow's cell, and see that everything was perfectly secure?"</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8051-00000005"/>
               <p>"Yes—it was all right," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Rimser, is Jack Harold handsome?" inquired the pretty Nell, now for the first
                  time taking a part in the conversation; for the subject of the discourse had begun
                  to awaken her interest and curiosity.</p>
               <p>"Ahem! why, to tell you the truth, Miss Nell," answered the worthy turnkey, who
                  was too honest a fellow to speak disparagingly of the personal appearance of a
                  handsome youth, even in the presence of the woman he loved—"to tell you the truth,
                  the young fellow is rather good-looking; in fact, he is one of the handsomest boys
                  I ever saw; for he isn't over seventeen or eighteen years of age. His form is
                  splendid, and his face is beautiful enough to set half the girls in Philadelphia
                  fairly distracted!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, how I should like to see him!" cried the young lady, her enthusiasm imparting
                  a rich glow to her dimpled cheeks—"there is something <emph>so</emph> romantic in
                  a handsome robber!—Ah! I adore such fellows as Dick Turpin, Claude du Val, and
                  Jack Harold! I remember, papa, that good-looking pickpocket, English Tom, whom you
                  had in jail some time ago; what a dashing air, and what fine, bold eyes he had! I
                  declare, I quite fell in love with him, and was almost tempted to steal the keys
                  of the jail and let him out. To-morrow, when Jack Harold is taken out for trial, I
                  am determined to have a peep at him, if I die for it!"</p>
               <p>"Hush, child," said her father, reprovingly—"how can you speak thus in reference
                  to thieves and felons? As for this Harold, he's a delicate, womanish-looking
                  rascal, with a mind as weak and effeminate as his looks. <emph>He</emph> threaten
                  to be present at this party! I shouldn't be at all afraid to imprison him in a
                  willow basket, for I am confident that he hasn't the pluck to break out of it.
                  Curse the fellow he hasn't a single particle of manhood in his entire
                  composition!"</p>
               <p>"LIAR!"</p>
               <p>This single word was uttered in a loud, stern voice. Everybody turned, and beheld
                  a youth of a slight, but graceful and elegant form, and a countenance of rare
                  beauty. Fierce anger flashed in his eyes, and an expression of ineffable scorn sat
                  upon his lips.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rimser dropped a glass of wine which he was in the act of drinking, and
                  exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"<emph>Jack Harold, by God!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said our hero, proudly—"I am he. Captain Douglass, you are a tyrant, a
                  villain, a bully and a liar! Here, in the presence of your assembled guests, does
                  Jack Harold spit upon and defy you! You called me a coward, and asserted that I
                  lacked the spirit and the courage to break from imprisonment; yet you perceive
                  that I am here, to fulfill my appointment, and to hurl defiance in your teeth! I
                  have come to drink to the health and happiness of that sweet maiden, who is alone
                  disgraced by her relationship to <emph>you</emph>—hard-hearted miscreant that you
                  are!"</p>
               <p>The audacious youth snatched from the table a full glass of wine, and raising it
                  high above his head, he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Here's to the health and happiness of the pretty Nell Douglass—may she never get
                  a worse husband than Rimser the turnkey!"</p>
               <p>Then, looking the head jailor sternly in the face, he added—</p>
               <p>"<emph>And here's damnation to the tyrant!</emph>"</p>
               <p>As he uttered these words, he dashed the full glass of wine, with unerring aim,
                  directly into the countenance of the astounded Captain Douglass, who, as well as
                  the rest of the company, had remained paralyzed with astonishment during the
                  progress of the foregoing extraordinary scene.</p>
               <p>The wine glass was shattered to pieces, cutting the Captain's face in several
                  places, while the ruby contents completely saturated his carefully arranged
                  shirt-frill.</p>
               <p>"Blood and furies!" cried the maddened head jailor, literally foaming with rage;
                  and, leaping to his feet, he exclaimed, in tones of thunder—</p>
               <p>"Villain, die the death of a dog!—The law will justify me in shooting an escaped
                  felon. This to your brains!"</p>
               <p>Quick as lighting he drew a revolver from his breast; and taking a deadly aim at
                  our hero, pressed the trigger—</p>
               <p>Just as his daughter had thrown herself before him, by a sudden impulse, crying,
                  in imploring accents—</p>
               <p>"Pray don't shoot him, father!"</p>
               <p>Too late—too late! The report of the pistol filled the apartment with its mimic
                  thunder, ere the excited man could stay his hand.</p>
               <p>Jack Harold stood unharmed.</p>
               <p>But oh, horrible result! the bullet had entered the heart of that ill-fated young
                  girl, and <emph>Captain Douglass was the slayer of his own daughter!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>It was a frightful and a soul-harrowing scene, such as sometimes haunts us in our
                  dreams!</p>
               <p>The horrified looks of the guests, who, pale with agitation and terror, seemed
                  rooted to their seats.</p>
               <p>The shrinking form of Jack Harold, who was overcome by the fearful nature of the
                  catastrophe.</p>
               <p>The wretched father, his rigid and ghastly face covered with a cold perspiration,
                  the veins upon his forehead swelled almost to bursting, his eyes starting from
                  their sockets. The awful occurrence appeared to have frozen up every faculty of
                  body and soul; he stood with outstretched arms, motionless—like a marble statue of
                  despair!</p>
               <p>The grief depicted in the honest countenance of the poor turnkey, who supported in
                  his arms the lifeless form of her whom he had sincerely loved.</p>
               <p>And oh! more horrible than all! the bleeding corpse of that unfortunate girl—so
                  light-hearted and so beautiful—that creature so artless, so innocent and so
                  gay—whose very presence was a ray of sunshine—the "pretty Nell Douglass," who had
                  fallen a victim to her generous desire to save the life of one whom she only knew
                  as a prisoner escaped from jail!</p>
               <p>A few minutes of intense and death-like silence prevailed.</p>
               <p>Then, arousing from his lethargy by a mighty effort—like a statue struck by the
                  lightnings of immortal Jove, bursting asunder its shackles of stone, and starting
                  into life—all the horrible realities of the scene rushing upon his disordered mind
                  with the force of a raging whirlwind—with a howl like that of a tiger robbed of
                  its young—the bereaved father sprang upon Jack Harold, seized him by the throat,
                  and hurled him to the floor.</p>
               <p>Captain Douglass, under any circumstances, was a man of uncommon physical power;
                  but, upon this occasion, his strength was increased four-fold.—His muscular hands
                  encircled our hero's neck with the force of a vice.—Jack's face became livid, and
                  there was every reasonable prospect of his being strangled on the spot—in which
                  case the gallows would have been robbed of a victim, and our narrative would now
                  be brought to an abrupt termination. But it was not so to be.</p>
               <p>For suddenly the Captain's grasp relaxed, and with a deep groan he fell to the
                  floor, senseless.</p>
               <p>Jack Harold had stabbed him with the Spanish dirk-knife furnished him by the
                  mysterious Jew.</p>
               <p>The guests were aroused from their stupor, by this fresh deed of blood; and they
                  gathered around the young Criminal, with loud cries of—</p>
               <p>"Seize the villain! Kill him! Tear him in pieces!"</p>
               <p>"Stand off!" cried Jack, brandishing the knife with an air of fierce
                  determination—"I wish not to shed more<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8051-00000006"/>
                  blood, but the first man who touches me, dies!"</p>
               <p>The crowd drew back, in fear. It was strange to see stout and rugged men quailing
                  before the lightning glances of that slender but desperate youth!</p>
               <p>Jack gradually worked his way within reach of the table, and, ere the guests could
                  anticipate his design, he suddenly overturned it. The plates, bottles, glasses,
                  lamps, &amp;c., came to the floor with a tremendous crash, and the room was
                  enveloped in darkness.</p>
               <p>Five minutes of wild confusion ensued; the bewildered guests stumbled against each
                  other, or fell and bruised themselves amid the ruins of the feast. At length a
                  light was procured; but, on looking around, it was discovered that the daring
                  yonng outlaw had made his escape.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE VOLUPTUOUS ISABELLA AND THE MYSTERIOUS JEW.</head>
               <p>Let us now proceed to the abode of the arch imposter who styles himself the
                  "Wandering Jew."</p>
               <p>It is evening, and this man is seated in a well-furnished room, which contains
                  nothing to indicate the peculiar nature of his calling. Stripped of the costume
                  and appointments in which he imposes upon the credulity and excites the awe of his
                  visiters who come to seek mysterious knowledge, we see before us a man possessed
                  of a vigorous form and a dark, repulsive and villainous countenance. His garments
                  betray a vulgar taste, being coarse and showy. His brows are knit, his lips firmly
                  compressed; and, for a while, he seems buried in profound thought.</p>
               <p>"I have furnished Jack Harold with the proper tools," he muttered—"and, with his
                  skill and daring, he can hardly fail to make good his escape from jail. I am
                  convinced that he suspects nothing of my true identity, and that he will, from
                  motives of curiosity, if nothing else, fulfill his promise and visit me, as soon
                  as he is at liberty.—He must escape to-night, for his tria. comes on to-morrow;
                  and he will probably arrive here at about midnight. I must get him entirely under
                  my control, still retaining my assumed character as the "Jew." When I have
                  succeeded in getting him to commit a MURDER, then will I denounce him to the
                  authorities, and fulfill my oath by seeing him swing upon the gallows! Ha! there
                  goes the bell! Another visiter. The business thrives—I shall grow rich. What weak
                  and credulous fools there are in the world!"</p>
               <p>A man dressed as a Turk entered the room, and announced that a well-dressed lady,
                  closely veiled, desired an interview with the Wandering Jew.</p>
               <p>"Does she appear to be a young person?" asked the arch imposter.</p>
               <p>"Judging from her form and gait, I should say she was," replied the pretended
                  Turk.</p>
               <p>"Humph! some love-sick damsel, I suppose, who has come to consult me concerning
                  her lover, whom she suspects of inconstancy. With such customers 'tis scarcely
                  worth my while to go through with the coffin and picture performances. I will put
                  on my disguise; and, in five minutes, you will show the lady into this
                  apartment—you understand?"</p>
               <p>The attendant bowed, and withdrew; while the imposter proceeded to array himself
                  in the mask and habilaments of the "Jew."</p>
               <p>At the expiration of five minutes, the door opened and a lady entered.—She was
                  richly dressed, and her air was distinguished. Her countenance was entirely
                  concealed by a thick veil.</p>
               <p>"Be seated, madam," said the imposter, in a hollow tone, as he pointed to a
                  chair.</p>
               <p>The lady started, no less at the sepulchral voice, than at the fearful appearance
                  of the "Jew." Summoning up courage, however, she took a seat in such a position
                  that, while the imposter remained in shadow, her person was fully revealed to his
                  gaze by the clear rays of the lamp.</p>
               <p>"What would you with me, madam?" demanded the Jew—"speak freely, for we are
                  alone."</p>
               <p>"I have heard of your wonderful celebrity as a magician," said the lady, in low,
                  tremulous tones—"and have come to consult you upon a subject of extreme
                  delicacy."</p>
               <p>"Before we proceed further," said the Jew—"I must request you to raise your veil;
                  for, as the science of physiogomy is one of the principal auxiliaries of my art,
                  it is indispensable that I should behold your face."</p>
               <p>"I cannot comply with your demand," rejoined the lady, in a some-what haughty
                  tone—"for the nature of my application to you is such as to render it necessary
                  for me to preserve the strictest <foreign xml:lang="ITA">incognito</foreign>."</p>
               <p>"Then, madam," said the Jew, coldly, as he arose from his seat—"our interview is
                  at an end."</p>
               <p>"Nay, then, if you insist upon it, I will do as you wish;" and with these words
                  the lady raised her veil.</p>
               <p>The Jew started, as if in surprise; and muttered to himself—</p>
               <p>"By heavens! I know her now.—What can have brought <emph>her</emph> here? Yet I
                  see it all; the enlarged proportions of her form tell the whole story. Ah, ah! I
                  shall have no difficulty in convincing this lady of my wonderful powers."</p>
               <p>The countenance of the lady, who had probably reached her twenty-fourth year, was
                  regular and handsome, though somewhat grave in its expression A keen observer
                  might have detected that this gravity was rather assumed than natural. Her dark
                  brown hair was very elegantly yet simply arranged; and her form, which was
                  somewhat tall, was finely proportioned, and exhibited the outlines of a superb
                  bust.</p>
               <p>One peculiarity in her form would have struck even a careless observer—the
                  amplitude of her waist which indicated that she was "in that state in which ladies
                  love to be who love their lords."</p>
               <p>A deep blush suffused her countenance, when she saw that the Jew was regarding her
                  with the closet scrutiny.</p>
               <p>"She is a glorious and voluptuous creature," muttered the imposter—can I not take
                  advantage of her past frailty by extorting her favors? I shall sec."</p>
               <p>"Can not your magical science acquaint you with the particular object of my coming
                  here?" inquired the lady.</p>
               <p>"Ah, you wish to avoid the mortification of a delicate disclosure," said the
                  Jew—"'tis natural. I must consult my magical chart."</p>
               <p>So saying, he took from a drawer a scroll of parchment, which, on being held to
                  the light, proved to be entirely blank. Muttering certain cabalistic words, he
                  continued for a few minutes to wave this scroll around the flame of the lamp.
                  Finally, there appeared upon the blank parchment a multitude of strange characters
                  and hieroglyphics, whose meaning it would have puzzled Doctor Faustus, or the
                  devil himself, to make out. This feat was not a very astounding one, being easily
                  accomplished by the aid of a superficial knowledge of chemistry. To an ignorant
                  observer, however, it would seem wonderful.</p>
               <p>The lady, being educated and intelligent, smiled scornfully on witnessing this
                  simple experiment, for she fully comprehended its nature.</p>
               <p>The Jew now appeared to examine the characters upon the parchment with close
                  attention. Then he affected the greatest astonishment at the information thus
                  acquired and he gazed<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8051-00000007"/> at his fair visiter
                  with a look of interest and amazement.</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible, madam," he exclaimed—" that I have the honor of receiving a
                  visit from a lady of your distinction?"</p>
               <p>"You do not know me," said the lady, with another scornful smile.</p>
               <p>"Question me," said the Jew—"and you shall be convinced."</p>
               <p>"I have but little confidence in your power; can you state my name?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly—<emph>Miss Isabella Rich!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The lady screamed with astonishment; but, having long accustomed herself to
                  command her feelings, and to conceal her most violent emotions, under a mask of
                  indifference, she quickly recovered her usual composure—her cold, passionless
                  demeanor.</p>
               <p>Beneath an exterior which seemed to indicate the absence of every amorous impulse,
                  and the existence of the most rigid virtue, the bosom of this young lady contained
                  a perfect volcano of raging desires and passionate yearnings.<ref rend="super"

                  </note>
               <p>"What further knowledge have you of me?" asked Miss Isabella Rich.</p>
               <p>"You are the only daughter of the highest officer in the State of New York."</p>
               <p>"That, also, is correct; what further?"</p>
               <p>"You have been indiscreet in an amour."</p>
               <p>"Go on, strange man!"</p>
               <p>"You have come to consult me in relation to the best method of concealing your
                  frailty from the knowledge of the world in which you hold so distinguished a
                  position."</p>
               <p>"Gracious heavens! you read my heart as an open book!" cried the frail fair one,
                  again losing all her cold composure in the excitement of wonder—"mysterious man,
                  you have stated everything correctly; henceforth I shall entertain the most
                  implicit belief in the powers of magic. Tell me—tell me of some sure, safe and
                  secret means of getting rid of the evidence of my frailty, so that my reputation
                  may be preserved; do this, and any reward which you may demand, shall be granted.
                  Besides, you may be assured of my eternal gratitude. The exalted character which I
                  have heretofore sustained, for piety and virtue, would render my exposure doubly
                  mortifying."</p>
               <p>"I can assist you, madam; but I fear that the reward which I shall require, as a
                  recompense for my services, will seem to you to be preposterous."</p>
               <p>As the disguised scoundrel uttered these words, he fastened his lustful eyes upon
                  the lady's animated countenance.</p>
               <p>"State the sum of money that will satisfy you," said Miss Rich, averting her
                  face—"and, however high it may be, it shall be paid you. Fear not to name your
                  price, for I can command almost any sum."</p>
               <p>"Lady, I crave not <emph>money</emph> from so sweet a creature as yourself; there
                  is another way in which to requite my services——"</p>
               <p>The Jew suddenly paused, and advanced towards his fair listener with outstretched
                  arms, as if with the intention of embracing her.</p>
               <p>The lady regarded him with an expression of undisguised wonder.</p>
               <p>"I do not comprehend you," said she.</p>
               <p>"Would you have me speak plainer?" demanded the Jew.</p>
               <p>"If you were a young man," rejoined the lady, with embarrassment—"there would be
                  but one way of interpreting your words; but surely a person of your very advanced
                  age cannot imagine that——no, sir, you have mistaken me; it must not be. I will
                  take my leave without troubling you any further, since you demand in me a
                  sactifice so odious, and, considering your years, so absurd, so impracticable, and
                  so unnatural."</p>
               <p>She arose, and walked towards the door.</p>
               <p>The Jew advanced, and seized her arm.</p>
               <p>"Hear me, lady," said he, in a voice hoarse, but tremulous with passion—"you know
                  that I am in possession of your most dangerous secrets.—I have but to proclaim my
                  knowledge of your character and situation, to ensure your ruin, your eternal
                  disgrace, and exclusion from respectable society. Think of your distinguished
                  father, your admiring relatives and friends, who all unite in believing you to be
                  a model of piety, chastity and excellence. Would you have your shame trumpeted
                  through the length and breadth of the land—your frailty a rich harvest for
                  miserable penny-a-liners, and your person an object of loathing, for the finger of
                  scorn to point at? Do not, by a foolish refusal to comply with my wishes, ensure
                  your own future misery and degradation!"</p>
               <p>The wily rascal, in his strong desire to possess his beautiful listener, delivered
                  the foregoing speech with real eloquence and thrilling effect.</p>
               <p>The lady trembled, while the Jew painted, in such vivid colors, the consequences
                  of her refusing to yield her person up to his embraces.</p>
               <p>Yet her fear was mingled with as tonishment, that a man so apparently aged, should
                  display a vehemence of amorous passion usually ascribed to fiery youth or vigorous
                  manhood alone.</p>
               <p>For the fair Isabella Rich was deeply <emph>experienced</emph> in all the
                  mysteries of intrigue. Not only had the ardor of boyhood and the impetuosity of
                  youth been quenched in her arms, but feeble old age had been warmed into animation
                  by her caresses, and pillowed its withered face upon her volupiuous bosom.</p>
               <p>We may observe, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en passant,</foreign> that Miss Isabella's
                  interesting condition, upon the occasion to which we are now referring, was owing
                  to the pious efforts of the Rev. Lustful Cheatem, a venerable New York clergyman,
                  and President of the "Man-Eating and Heathen Donation Society." With this
                  gentleman she had for several years been on terms of the most
                     <emph>intimate</emph> friendship.</p>
               <p>Recovering some what from the terrifying effect produced by the speech of the Jew,
                  Miss Isabella said to him—</p>
               <p>"For heaven's sake talk not of exposing me! Any sacrifice, even death itself,
                  would be preferable to that!—But there is something about you, strange man, that I
                  cannot fathom—a something which leads me to suspect that you are not what you
                  seem.—Your voice is changed from the faltering accents of extreme old age to the
                  powerful tones of manhood. How is this?"</p>
               <p>"I will attempt to deceive you no longer; behold!" cried the imposter tearing off
                  his disguise, and presenting himself to the astonished lady in all his burly
                  strength and ruffianly aspect.</p>
               <p>"I ought scarcely to be surprised at this sudden transformation," remarked Miss
                  Isabella Rich, quickly recovering her presence of mind—" for I had begun to
                  suspect something of the kind. You are, I confess, far less repulsive to me now
                  than you were in the character of an aged and decrepit man. Aid me in my
                  emergency, and—and—</p>
               <p>"You will grant all that I require—is it not so, fair creature?" cried the
                  enraptured Jew, as he clasped her rounded form in a warm and vigorous embrace.</p>
               <p>The beautiful Isabella blushed her assent, as she abandoned herself to the
                  caresses of the ruffian.</p>
               <p>The change wrought in the appearance of the Jew, by the removal of his disguise,
                  was not more striking than was the alteration in the aspect of this frail lady,
                  now that her passions were aroused by the immediate prospect of<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000008"/> indulging in amorous dalliance, even with that
                  villainous impostor.</p>
               <p>For all her gravity and purity of expression, which she wore as a mantle to
                  conceal the real wantonness of her nature, had vanished, to give place to the glow
                  of desire which now suffused her face, her neck, down to her beautifully rounded
                  shoulders; a glow warm and rich as the hue of the western sky at sunset; a glow
                  produced by her burning blood which coursed madly through every vein. She seemed
                  the very incarnation of the soft and melting passion. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Her eyes, her lips, her cheeks, her shape, her features.</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The licentious Jew glues his hot lips to hers, and the kiss is returned; his
                  coarse hand toys with the luxuriant development of her fine bust, and her actions
                  seem to invite the familiarity. He whispers a few words in her ear, and glances
                  significantly at the door of a chamber which adjoins the room; her looks, in
                  return, not only express a perfect willingness, but a wild impatience.</p>
               <p>And then the precious pair—the pretended magician and the pretended pious
                  lady—pass into the chamber, and door is closed.</p>

                  <unclear>Upon the</unclear> expiration of an hour <unclear>afterwards,</unclear>
                  Miss Isabella Rich left the abode of the "Wandering Jew," who had her with a
                  letter of address recommendation to one of the most celebrated and infamous female
                     <emph>abortionists</emph> of the day.</p>
               <p>When his visiter had departed, the impostor threw himself into a seat and rubbed
                  his hands with every appearance of the most intense satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Ah, she is a glorious creature!" he muttered—"during the whole course of my
                  extensive experience in such matters, I have never met her equal. What fire, what
                  impetuosity, what insatiable ardor does she possess! In point of voluptuous
                  beauty, she <unclear>is</unclear> scarcely surpassed by that magnificent woman,
                  Mrs. Harold, whom I——but enough of that; that was the darkest crime of my life.
                  Malediction! if her husband, who is now, I hear, a member of Congress, should
                  discover in me the perpetrator of that outrage, I tremble for the consequences. I
                  am safe enough, however, in regard to that matter; but let me leave the subject;
                  for I hate to think of it. The recollection of that crime is associated with
                  murder and vengeance, and yet I can never forget <emph>that night</emph> of
                  delirious pleasure!</p>
               <p>"Let me, if possible, consign the past to the dark tomb of oblivion, and reflect
                  upon the present and the future. 'Twas fortunate I knew this Miss Isabella Rich,
                  whom I have often had pointed out to me upon the fashionable promenades of New
                  York, as the daughter of a distinguished politician. My knowledge of her name,
                  connections, &amp;c., astonished her, and established my power over her; as to her
                  being <foreign xml:lang="FRA">enciente,</foreign> any ordinary observer would have
                  noticed that fact; and it was a very natural surmise on my part that she had come
                  to consult me as to the best means of screening herself from exposure. Many ladies
                  have visited me on the same delicate business, and <emph>all</emph> of them have
                  been compelled to grant me their favors, for when once they cross the threshold of
                  this house, they are completely in my power.—Yes—they are in my power in a double
                  sense; both in person and reputation—for, if my threats of <emph>exposure</emph>
                  fail to make them yield, then <emph>force</emph> over-powers them—their cries
                  never penetrate beyond these walls, and they are afterwards very little disposed
                  to proclaim the outrage in order to bring me to justice, their visits to me being
                  of such a very questionable character, so far as they are concerned.</p>
               <p>"Now this Miss Isabella Rich has placed herself in my power, from this night
                  forth. I shall have no difficulty, at any time, in extorting from her almost any
                  amount of caresses and cash, as the price of my silence in regard to her frailty.
                  As to her caresses, she herself assured me that I should be welcome to them at any
                  time, when opportunity served, 'for,' said she 'you play the part of the lover
                  even better than you personate the character of the old man.' As to the matter of
                  cash, money is no object to her, for she is the heiress to a splendid fortune. I
                  have but to ask, to receive."</p>
               <p>While the impostor was indulging in these reflections, to him so agreeable, the
                  clock struck eleven.</p>
               <p>"Another hour," he muttered—"and I shall expect the arrival of Jack Harold."</p>
               <p>The hour passed, and the door bell was rung.</p>
               <p>"'Tis he!" cried the Jew, in a tone of triumph—"now he shall mount the last round
                  of the ladder which leads to the scaffold!"</p>
               <p>The Turkish attendant entered.</p>
               <p>"It is a youth who wishes to see me, is it not?" demanded the Jew,
                  breathlessly.</p>
               <p>"No—it is another <emph>lady,</emph>"</p>
               <p>
                  <unclear>A lady—confusion!</unclear> Then it cannot be Jack, yet he may have
                  disguised himself in female attire, the better <unclear>to</unclear> his escape.
                  That's it! <unclear/>how this <emph>lady</emph> up!"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">ANOTHER LADY VISITER.</head>
               <p>Scarcely had the Jew assumed his disguise, when the door opened and the new
                  visiter entered.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, Jack Harold!" cried the impostor, advancing with extended hand.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he started and drew back; for he perceived that the visiter was a lady,
                  and <emph>not</emph> the young Outlaw.</p>
               <p>The conduct of this lady, on hearing the name "Jack Harold," was most
                  unaccountable and extraordinary. With a loud shriek, she staggered back against
                  the wall, and after vainly endeavoring to articulate, fell senseless upon the
                  floor.</p>
               <p>The Jew raised her up, placed her upon the sofa, and sprinkled water upon her cold
                  and marble-like face, in order to restore her to a state of consciousness. While
                  thus engaged, the following thoughts passed through his mind:—</p>
               <p>"My frighful appearance has so overpowered this lady, that she has swooned. I can
                  scarcely wonder at it, for I <emph>do</emph> look rather awful in this masquerade
                  costume. What can be the object of her coming here? Judging from her appearance, I
                  should say most decidedly that she is <emph>not</emph> in the delicate condition
                  of her predecessor. She probably desires imformation on some subject or
                  other—perhaps concerning a run-away husband, or a lost child, for I perceive that
                  she is a woman of middle age. Though somewhat faded, she is still quite beautiful;
                  and her garb shows that she is a lady of highly respectable position.</p>
               <p>"There is something in her countenance that seems strangely familiar to me; 'tis
                  not in the outline of her features, nor yet in the expression. But there is a
                  certain indefinable <emph>something</emph> that reminds me of—of—on my life, I
                  cannot tell whom. It is probable that I have never before seen this lady; yet I am
                  quite positive that I have seen somebody who resembles her to a most remarkable
                  degree. Who that somebody is, I cannot recall to mind. No matter: 'tis of no
                  consequence.</p>
               <p>"Humph! shall I add this comely dame to the list of those whose favors I have
                  enjoyed, when they have come to consult me? <emph>She</emph> looks as if she would
                  not submit to my solicitations, under any circumstances. Why not take advantage of
                  her present unconscious<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8051-00000009"/> scious state? No,
                  I will not; not that that I have any moral scruples, but because my recent
                  delightful interview with Isabella Rich has rendered me indifferent to any
                  immediate gratification.</p>
               <p>"It is time for Jack Harold to arrive; what can have detained him?—Has he failed
                  in the attempt to escape? If so, all is lost, for to-morrow night he will be
                  within the walls of the Eastern Penitentiary, from which escape is impossible, as
                  I have good reason to know, having myself passed five years in its gloomy cells,
                  and made every effort to gain my liberty, in vain.</p>
               <p>"May all the saints assist him in escaping to-night! If he fails, to-morrow he
                  will be taken into court and sentenced to fifteen or twenty years' imprisonment.
                  Either he or I may die before the expiration of that time;and then will I be
                  cheated of my <emph>vengeance!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"But, if the good saints shall aid him in the enterprise of to-night, he shall
                  swing upon the gallows before the expiration of another year!</p>
               <p>"When I exhibited to him the two pictures of magic lantern, I intended that the
                  hanging scene in the yard of the Egyptian Tombs should be fulfilled; not so,
                  however, with the picture representing the interior of the Eastern Penitentiary,
                  which I merely introduced for effect, as a preliminary to the execution scene.
                  Heaven grant that the Eastern Penitentiary scene may never be fulfilled, for I
                  have something far more terrible than that, in reserve for the object of my
                  hate!</p>
               <p>"If he does not arrive within an hour, I shall begin to despair. So, so! the lady
                  revives. Fear not, madam; let out my appearance frighten you.—No harm shall happen
                  to you."</p>
               <p>The lady slowly opened her eyes, and gazed about her with an air of be wilderment.
                  Soon she became fully conscious of her situation. Raising herself from her
                  recumbent position upon the sofa, she regarded the false Jew with a look in which
                  there was much of wonder and inquiry, but not a single trace of fear.</p>
               <p>Now that her handsome but rather care-worn countenance was illumined by the
                  intelligence of a pair of fine, expressive eyes, the Jew became still more
                  strongly convinced that he had seen some person who bore to her most astonishing
                  resemblance.</p>
               <p>"When I entered this apartment," said the lady—" you pronounced the name of
                     <emph>Jack Harold;</emph> it was my astonishment at hearing that name which
                  caused me to swoon,"</p>
               <p>"Why were you astonished at hearing it?" demanded the Jew, profoundly
                  surprised—"do you know the person who bears that name?"</p>
               <p>"It was concerning that very person that I came to consult you. I had little faith
                  in your art, but my extreme anxiety in regard to the youth drove me here. Judge,
                  then, my astonishment, on entering this room, to hear you utter his name, before I
                  had opened my lips. Every doubt of your supernatural powers is removed. Wonderful
                  man, now knew you that I came to consult you respecting that particular
                  person.</p>
               <p>"Humph! a very singular coincidence of events," said the Jew to himself—"supposing
                  her to be Jack in disguise, I utter his name; this lady, who has come here for the
                  purpose of seeking information in regard to Jack, thinks that I announce the
                  object of her coming; she ascribes my supposed knowledge of her unuttered wish, to
                  my magical art—and she is, of course, astonished. What a remarkable combination of
                  circumstances, all tending to impress her with the fullest belief in my powers as
                  a magician! Now can I work upon her credulity with success. What under heaven can
                  she want in know about Jack? but perhaps the young rascal has robbed her, and she
                  wishes to find out some means of recovering ering the booty. I shall see
                  anon."</p>
               <p>"Madam," said the impostor, aloud—"the sublime mysteries of my science enables me
                  to read within your heart the unexpressed desire to gain information concerning
                  the person whom I named on your first entrance here. Several days ago my prophetic
                  gifts announced to me that you would come here to-night, at twelve, for the
                  purpose of knowing something of Jack Harold, as he is called. But that is merely a
                  name given him by his adopted parents; he is an illegitimate child."</p>
               <p>"My God! that is true," cried the lady, hiding her face in her handkerchief, and
                  sobbing violently. Her emotion caused a flood of light to rush upon the mind of
                  the Jew, who, on again obtaining a view of her countenance, said to himself—</p>
               <p>"It must be so, and I am blind not to have arrived at the fact sooner, for the
                  resemblance between them is most striking and remarkable."</p>
               <p>"Madam," added he, aloud—"shall I continue to speak of this young man in whom you
                  seem to be interested?"</p>
               <p>The lady assented by a sign.</p>
               <p>"Well, then: Jack Harold, although a mere youth, has attained to a rare
                  distinction in crime; he is, in short, a most notorious Criminal."</p>
               <p>"Spare me—oh, in pity spare me!" cried the wretched woman, in piercing
                  accents.</p>
               <p>"He is destined to terminate his career upon the gallows," said the Jew, in a tone
                  of malicious triumph.</p>
               <p>"God, in his infinite mercy, forbid!" exclaimed the lady, clasping her hands and
                  raising her streaming eyes to heaven.</p>
               <p>"<emph>This gallows-doomed Criminal is your own son!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The unhappy and unfortunate Clarissa Cooper—the mother of Jack Harold—would have
                  again fallen to the floor, had she not been caught in the arms of the villainous
                  Jew.</p>
               <p>Recovering herself by a powerful effort, she released herself from her support,
                  and by degrees became tolerably calm.</p>
               <p>The impostor seated himself at a little distance from her, and regarded her with a
                  sort of ferocious satisfaction. It seemed as if the deep and intense hatred which
                  he felt towards the son, extended itself also to the mother.</p>
               <p>After a pause of a few minutes, Miss Cooper said, in a low and tremulous tone—</p>
               <p>"In the hour of my shame and sorrow—for I was the victim of a villainous seducer—I
                  abandoned my child to the mercy of strangers. The knowledge of my history which
                  you have already displayed, mysterious man, assures me that you are acquainted
                  with many circumstances which it is unnecessary for me to repeat."</p>
               <p>"Concerning the miniature and other matters," suggested the Jew, who knew the
                  whole story, which had been imparted to him in detail by the
                  '<emph>Prince,</emph>' Jack's father.</p>
               <p>"Yes," continued the lady, sadly "I never knew the name of the kind family who
                  adopted and reared my son as their own. Shame, and the fear of exposure, prevented
                  me from making any inquiries after him. Six yearsage I fancied that I saw him,
                  under very strange and mysterious circumstances, but I may have been mistaken. I
                  have, up to this very day, been in profound ignorance, not only of his fate, but
                  of his name. In company with my parents, I arrived this very morning from
                  Washington. Fatigued with travelling, I retired to my chamber, in order to seek a
                  little repose. Dreams crowded upon me, for my mind was troubled; I saw, in my
                  fancy, a young girl, for the purpose of protecting herself from violence, plunge a
                  glittering knife into the breast of my seducer, whose name was——"</p>
               <p>"The Prince, John Hamblin," observed the Jew interrupting her</p>
               <p>"Yes, that was his name; I saw<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8051-00000010"/> him
                  weltering in his gore, and I felt that he had met the just reward of his
                  villainy."</p>
               <p>"Your dream was correct, for the Prince met his death in precisely the manner you
                  have described," remarked the Jew, much surprised—for, pretended magician as he
                  was, he had no real faith in the accuracy of dreams.</p>
               <p>"If John Hamblin is dead, the world has got rid of a villain," continued Miss
                  Cooper. "Often have I been tempted to destroy his life; but the dread of staining
                  my soul with the awful crime of murder restrained me. I next dreamed that the
                  young girl who slew my seducer became intimate with a youth of lawless habits, who
                  was called <emph>Jack Harold,</emph> and who was <emph>my own son.</emph>
                  Frightened and trembling, I awoke, and endeavored to forget the visions of my
                  sleep by glancing over the columns of an old newspaper in which I had wrapped
                  several articles of the toilet. Conceive my astonishment when my eyes fell upon a
                  paragraph of two lines, which read thus:—"The celebrated <emph>Jack Harold</emph>
                  has again escaped from the Refuge." The name exactly corresponded with that of the
                  subject of my dream. I was overwhelmed with wonder at a coincidence so
                  extraordinary. Something whispered to my soul that the person alluded to in the
                  newspaper was my son; and the mysterious instincts of nature prompted me to seek
                  that person out, if possible."</p>
               <p>"Therefore you came directly to me," remarked the Jew.</p>
               <p>"I did, having previously heard of your fame as a magician. I came here with very
                  little confidence in your power, but the first words you uttered satisfied me that
                  your pretensions are just. And now, whoever you may be, I pray you to inform me
                  where this youth—my son—can be found. Though he be guilty of a thousand crimes, I
                  will none the less fondly clasp him to this maternal breast.'</p>
               <p>The Jew remained silent for a few minutes, during which his thoughts were not
                  idle, but moulded themselves into the following form:—</p>
               <p>"It is very singular that she should not have seen, in the newspapers of the
                  present week, the lengthy accounts of the great bank burglary in which Jack Harold
                  was concerned. But it is very evident that she has <emph>not</emph> seen these
                  accounts, for if she had, she would have known at once that Jack Harold—whom she
                  so anxiously seeks, and of whose whereabouts she seems to be in such profound
                  ignorance,—was probably to be found in snug quarters within the walls of the
                  Philadelphia jail. I'll question you on this point."</p>
               <p>"Madam," and the Jew—"the criminal exploits of your hopeful son at present fill
                  almost every newspaper in America. How comes it, then, that after dreaming of Jack
                  Harold, you did not immediately identify the vision of your sleep with the
                  celebrated young criminal who bears the same name?"</p>
               <p>"For the simple reason, sir, that I seldom or never look into a newspaper my
                  reading being limited almost entirely to the Bible and other religious books. I
                  was not aware that there was a great criminal called Jack Harold; would to heaven
                  that I had never known it!—Now, sir, take pity on an afflicted mother, and tell me
                  where I may find my erring son! Though he be a thousand miles distant from this, I
                  will fly to him, and on my bended knees win him back into the path of integrity
                  and virtue!"</p>
               <p>The Jew was about to make some reply, when he was interrupted by the sound of the
                  door-bell, which was rung with violence.</p>
               <p>An expression of joy and expectation then sat upon the villainons countenance of
                  the imposter.</p>
               <p>The Turkish attendant made his appearance at the door, and, having held a
                  whispered consultation with his master, he retired.</p>
               <p>The Jew then approached the lady who was sitting calm and unmoved upon the sofa.
                  She observed a sort of fiendish triumph in the eyes of the accomplished scoundrel,
                  for which she could not account.</p>
               <p>"Madam," said he—"how would you like to see your son this very night?"</p>
               <p>To-night!" cried the lady, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Yes—within an hour, in this very house."</p>
               <p>"Is this possible?"</p>
               <p>"All things are possible to me!—Yes, you shall see your son, provided you swear to
                  comply with certain conditions which I shall name."</p>
               <p>"I will agree to anything, if I can see my son," said the mother of our hero,
                  eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Listen, then," said the Jew, in whose polluted soul a dark and horrible plot had
                  already been hatched.—"You will conceal yourself in the room which adjoins this. A
                  small aperture in the wall will enable you to see and hear all that passes in this
                  apartment. I will receive your son here; I will draw him into conversation, and,
                  unconscious of your presence he will give utterance to his true sentiments without
                  any restraint. Thus you can have an excellent opportunity of judging his character
                  as it really is. Do you agree to this?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—anything to see my son."</p>
               <p>"Whatever you may hear, be careful to suppress any movement or exclamation of
                  surprise or horror."</p>
               <p>"Fear not—I shall be discreet."</p>
               <p>"When I have done conversing with your son, I shall, in a whispered tone, acquaint
                  him with the fact that his mother is in the next room, waiting to embrace
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Thanks—oh, a thousand thanks!"</p>
               <p>"You must be content to remain in darkness, until your son shall enter, bearing a
                  light. The moment that he enters, you must run towards him with extended arms</p>
               <p>"Ah! holy nature and nature love would prompt me to do that, without
                  instruction."</p>
               <p>"Run towards him with extended arms—but observe: <emph>your veil must be closely
                     drawn over your face</emph>, and you MUST SPEAK NOT ONE WORD."</p>
               <p>"The conditions are hard, but I agree to them, so that I see my son."</p>
               <p>"Fail not to comply with all these conditions to the very letter, or you shall be
                  separated from your son forever; you know my power."</p>
               <p>"I shall do everything as you have said."</p>
               <p>"Swear it, by the **** *****!"</p>
               <p>"You frighten me! But to see my son—yes, I solemnly swear it!"</p>
               <p>"Enough—now follow me into the adjoining room."</p>
               <p>The Jew opened a door, and conducted the lady into a small apartment which
                  appeared to be entirely unfurnished. In the wall was a narrow aperture which would
                  enable a concealed person to witness whatever might occur in the larger room, and,
                  at the same time, to hear whatever might be said.</p>
               <p>The lady, by the directions of the Jew, stationed herself at this aperture. Then
                  the impostor passed out into the larger room, carefully closing the door of
                  communication between the two apartments.</p>
               <p>Having seated himself, as was his custom, in a place remote from the glare of the
                  lamp, the Jew rang a bell.</p>
               <p>The door opened, and Jack Harold made his appearance.</p>

               <head type="sub">MOTHER AND SON.</head>
               <p>"Welcome! I congratulate you on your restoration to liberty," cried the arch
                  impostor.</p>
               <p>"For which I must return you<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8051-00000011"/> thanks,"
                  said our hero, as he threw himself into a chair—"and yet I could almost wish that
                  I were still an inmate of my solitary cell."</p>
               <p>"How! you regret having effected your escape! You could wish to have remained, in
                  order to receive a sentence of fifteen or twenty years' imprisonment! What mean
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"My escape has been attended with bloodshed."</p>
               <p>"Ha! state every particular, I pray you," said the Jew, with trembling
                  eagerness.</p>
               <p>"How comes it, O wise prophet and wonderful magician!" exclaimed Jack, with a
                  scarcely perceptible sneer—"how comes it, I say, that you, knowing everything
                  past, present and to come, are in ignorance of the deeply unfortunate and tragical
                  circumstances which attended my escape? But listen, and I will tell you all."</p>
               <p>Our hero then related all the details of his escape, with which the reader is
                  already acquainted. When he described the appalling scene in the supper room of
                  the jailor's house, and told how Captain Douglass had shot his own daughter, and
                  how he (Jack) had stabbed the Captain himself, he feared, mortally—when, we say,
                  our hero had stated all these circumstances, the Jew, unable to restain himself
                  longer, gave utterance to the most extravagant joy.</p>
               <p>"By heavens!" he cried—"the summit of my wishes is already attained, for you have
                  committed a murder!"</p>
               <p>A smothered groan was heard to proceed from the adjoining room. Jack started, and
                  glanced inquiringly at the Jew, who cast a look of fierce anger towards the
                  aperture in the wall.</p>
               <p>"What was that?" demanded our hero.</p>
               <p>"'Twas nothing but the wind moaning over the house-tops," answered the other—"but
                  are you <emph>sure</emph> that you killed Captain Douglass!"</p>
               <p>"The case was desperate, and I stabbed him severely. I am afraid that 'tis all
                  over with him."</p>
               <p>"Good—good!" muttered the Jew—"he has committed a murder, and I can now at any
                  time place him in the hangman's hands!"</p>
               <p>"For what purpose did you request me to come here?" asked the young Criminal.</p>
               <p>"You will know presently. Now that you are at liberty, what are your plans for the
                  future?"</p>
               <p>"I shall continue in my career of crime!"</p>
               <p>"Do you never think of repentance?"</p>
               <p>"Bah! repentance!—'tis the idle prattle of fools! It is impossible to repent, for
                  the world never forgives a departure from the line of its own stiff propriety. The
                  woman who falls from virtue can never rise again; the man who swerves from honesty
                  must remain forever a branded Outlaw!"</p>
               <p>A deep and long-drawn sigh from the aperture in the wall reached the sharp eyes of
                  the Jew, and again were his eyes turned in that direction with an expression of
                  anger.</p>
               <p>"Do you never feel any remorse—any qualms of conscience, on account of your evil
                  deeds!" inquired the impostor.</p>
               <p>"I did <emph>once</emph>—but that day is <unclear>past</unclear>. Henceforth, I
                  shall recklessly plunge onward in a course of guilt, nor pause until I
                  reach——"</p>
               <p>"The gallows," said the Jew, calmly.</p>
               <p>"Ay, the gallows! You yourself, old man, prophesied that thus should terminate my
                  career, and I believe you to be a true prophet.</p>
               <p>"The contemplation of my probable fate no longer inspires me with horror. When the
                  day of my doom arrives, I shall mount the scaffold with a firm step, and die with
                  a bold heart and an unblanched cheek. But would to heaven that I could meet that
                  villain o a Spaniard who first initiated me in crime! Eternal fury light upon him!
                  I would tear out his accursed heart."</p>
               <p>The Jew smiled strangely as he heard these words, and his eyes glittered like
                  those of a serpent.</p>
               <p>"I applaud your courage," said he—"and you may ere long have an opportunity to
                  test it. I have now something very particular to say to you; and, in order to be
                  on the safe side, I will communicate with you in a whisper."</p>
               <p>Casting a look of assurance towards the aperture in the wall—as if by way of
                  announcing to the concealed lady that he was then about to inform Jack of his
                  mother's presence—the Jew arose and seated himself in a chair close to our
                  hero.</p>
               <p>"What I have to tell you is of the greatest importance," said the artful and
                  accomplished villain, in a tone so low as to be entirely inaudible to the
                  concealed lady, who was gazing through the aperture with the utmost interest,
                  anxiety and impatience.</p>
               <p>"Proceed," said our hero.</p>
               <p>"You must answer, faithfully and truly, every question which I shall put to you;
                  for there are certain matters beyond the reach of my magical art."</p>
               <p>"Ask, and if proper, I will answer."</p>
               <p>"What has become of <emph>Gallus Kate?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Jack's brow grew dark, as he <unclear>replied</unclear>—</p>
               <p>"Curse her! She left me in the city of Washington, penniless; she eloped with a
                  fellow whom she scarcely knew, named Armitage."</p>
               <p>"That was a scurvy trick, for she professed to love you. Why don't you punish her
                  for her perfidy?"</p>
               <p>"I was in pursuit of her when I got into this unlucky bank business, which led to
                  my arrest. She and her lover are in Pittsburg, and I shall follow them."</p>
               <p>"Speak lower. What will you do to her, when you find her?"</p>
               <p>"I know not; I fear that I shall be tempted to slay both her and her
                  paramour."</p>
               <p>"What! you surely could not have the heart to injure Kate—lovely Kate—whom you
                  love so well?"</p>
               <p>"Love! I hate her worse than hell itself! She has proved herself treacherous,
                  cruel and mean; and by heavens! I will have terrible revenge!"</p>
               <p>"Softly—softly; don't speak so loud," whispered the Jew, as our hero, carried away
                  by his excitement, raised his voice; and then the wily rascal said to himself—</p>
               <p>"Merely by accident, but by the greatest good fortune, I have hit upon the right
                  track. I have now only to spur him on."</p>
               <p>"So," remarked the Jew, in the cautious whisper which he had adopted—"you will go
                  to Pittsburg?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—and I shall do a murder in Pittsburg, if I can but find her of whom I am in
                  search."</p>
               <p>"Speak lower, or <emph>Kate</emph> may overhear you."</p>
               <p>"Kate—what Kate?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Gallus Kate, to be sure—who else?"</p>
               <p>"Explain yourself—what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"I mean that she whom you seek is in this house."</p>
               <p>"'Tis impossible—'tis false!"</p>
               <p>"Why impossible, and why false? Is it very wonderful that she should have tarried
                  in Philadelphia, instead of going to Pittsburg? Is it very strange that she should
                  have come to consult me in regard to <emph>your</emph> fate? I tell you, boy, that
                  she whom you call Gallus Kate is in the next room."</p>
               <p>Jack started from his seat, but the strong hand of the Jew restrained him.</p>
               <p>"Be patient—be calm!" whispered the impostor—"or I swear you shall not see her.
                  Sit down!"</p>
               <p>Jack reluctantly resumed his seat. His dark and desperate soul thirsted for
                  revenge upon the perfidious Kate.</p>
               <p>"Restrain yourself," said the Jew, who still continued to speak in a low and
                  almost inaudible whisper—"utter not one word until I give you permission<pb
                     n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8051-00000012"/> sion, or by all that's sacred I will
                  cheat you of your vengeance! Do you promise? If so, nod your head."</p>
               <p>Jack gave the required sign of assent, and the impostor proceeded.</p>
               <p>"An hour ago, Kate came here in order to consult me concerning you. She asked me
                  how long a sentence you would get, on the bank burglary. I told her fifteen or
                  twenty years. She remarked with a smile of scorn upon her beautiful lip—'I am glad
                  of it; he deserves it, for he is a cowardly and contemptible puppy."</p>
               <p>Jack writhed in his seat; his countenance grew black with suppressed rage; a cold
                  perspiration covered his forehead, and his glaring eyes were fastened upon the
                  door leading into the next room.</p>
               <p>The Jew continued:—</p>
               <p>"Do not be offended with <emph>me</emph> for giving you the substance of Kate's
                  remarks. 'I never cared a copper for the poor fool,' said she—'I only made use of
                  him for my own purposes. Now that he is deprived of my support, the miserable
                  devil will starve to death.' And then she laughed heartily, in her sweet and
                  silvery manner, at the comical look of astonishment and mortification which (she
                  said) your namby-pamby countenance must have worn, when you discovered that she
                  had abandoned you and left you penniless."</p>
               <p>Jack literally foamed with rage; his entire form quivered with the intensity of
                  his passions; his teeth were ground together as closely as if he had been
                  afflicted with lockjaw, and his hands were clenched with a force that brought
                  blood from the palms of them.</p>
               <p>The Jew observed with hellish satisfaction these evidences of our hero's mad
                  excitement, which was absolutely essential to the diabolical purpose that he had
                  in view. He continued:—</p>
               <p>"Kate assured me, just before your arrival here, that while you and she lived
                  together in New York, she had over a dozen favored levers, while you, poor fool!
                  (I use her own language,) fondly imagined that she was faithful to you."</p>
               <p>Jack groaned with the agony of his pent-up rage. The Jew remarked—</p>
               <p>"You may speak now; but remember—in a whisper only."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Lend me a dirk-knife!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The words came hissing from between the set teeth of our hero. The Jew—who had
                  anticipated such a request, and prepared himself accordingly—secretly passed to
                  him a large and glittering weapon of the most formidable and murderous appearance,
                  saying—</p>
               <p>"Conceal this in your coat-sleeve until just before you strike—so, that's right.
                  Now take the lamp in your left hand, walk calmly to that door, open it, and enter
                  the room. The deceitful hussy, on seeing you, will perhaps run towards you with
                  her arms extended, with the intention of bestowing upon you a Judas-like kiss.
                  When near enough, stab her in the left breast; give her the full length of the
                  steel, so that it may cleave her false heart in twain!"</p>
               <p>"I need no instructions; I am not so much of a novice in the business as you may
                  imagine," responded the desperate youth, in a hoarse whisper. His agitation had
                  suddenly vanished, to <unclear>be</unclear> replaced by the most rigid
                  determination. He was deadly pale, and his eyes had that cold, hard and stony
                  expression which is a thousand times more terrible than the sparkle and the flash
                  of excited rage.</p>
               <p>For the false words of the lying Jew—words carefully selected by the abominable
                  scoundrel as being best calculated to drive his intended victim into a perfect
                  phrenzy of rage—those galling words, we say, had aroused within the breast of the
                  young Outlaw a stern and iron-like resolution to take the life of his former
                  paramour, "Gallus Kate,' whom he firmly believed to be in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>The reader of course perfectly comprehends the fiendish design of the villianous
                  lianous Jew, who had artfully arranged everything to the end that Jack Harold
                  might qualify himself for the gallows by <emph>murdering his own mother!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>And now the young Outlaw takes in his left hand the lamp; then, with a firm tread,
                  he advances to the door, and opens it. He has scarcely crossed the threshold, when
                  a <emph>veiled female rushes</emph> towards him with extended arms. He quickly
                  draws the knife from beneath his sleeve, and raises it high in air in order to
                  give the murderous thrust.</p>
               <p>The lady, observing this sudden movement, starts back in alarm, and exclaims, in
                  accent of mingled affection and reproach—</p>
               <p>"Oh, my son—my son!"</p>
               <p>And her life is saved.</p>
               <p>For Jack instantly recognizes her voice, and, throwing away his weapon, he clasps
                  his mother in his arms, and weeps like a child.</p>
               <p>And now, for the first time in many years, does the unfortunate Clarissa Cooper
                  press to her desolate bosom the long-lost son. Her maternal instinct tells her
                  that she is not deceived.</p>
               <p>It is a deeply affecting scene—this strange meeting of the heart broken mother
                  with her ruined and outlawed son.</p>
               <p>But that scene is of brief duration; for, like a stealthy serpent, the Jew comes
                  gliding into the apartment, and hoarsely whispers—</p>
               <p>"<emph>Is it done?</emph>"</p>
               <p>Then, seeing that his diabolical plan has failed, he gives vent to his
                  disappointment in a deep and terrible curse.</p>
               <p>Jack turns upon him with the fury of a wounded panther, seizes him by the throat,
                  and with irresistible force hurls him to the floor, at the same time
                  exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"So, damned villain! you would have had me murder my mother! Thank heaven, your
                  infernally artful plot, though so nearly successful, has failed! Keep off, or by
                  all that's sacred old man, magician or devil though you be, I'll strangle
                  you!"</p>
               <p>But the seemingly aged Jew possessed an amount of physical strength of which our
                  hero was little aware. Springing upon Jack with concentrated fury, he commenced a
                  most violent and savage attack upon him; and the pair rolled over and over upon
                  the floor in a most desperate struggle, their eyes gleaming with all the ferocity
                  inspired by their mutual hatred.</p>
               <p>Clarissa Cooper was an affrightened spectator of the scene.</p>
               <p>The Jew was too powerful for Jack, who, notwithstanding his indomitable courage,
                  would soon have been entirely at the mercy of his implacable enemy, had not his
                  hand, during the scuffle, fortunately come in contact with the dirk-knife which he
                  had thrown away, on recognizing his mother.</p>
               <p>Firmly grasping this deadly weapon, he attempted to stab the Jew with it, but the
                  scoundrel avoided the thrust, and, releasing his antagonist, precipitately
                  retreated to a corner of the room.</p>
               <p>For, during the contest, his long grey beard, and every other portion of his
                  disguise, had been torn in pieces, and his own hideous countenance was now fully
                  exposed to view.</p>
               <p>"LOPEZ THE SPANIARD!" exclaimed Jack, scarcely believing the evidence of his own
                  senses.</p>
               <p>The Spaniard—for such we shall hereafter call him—made no immediate reply, but
                  coolly walked into the adjoining room and deliberately rang the bell with which he
                  was accustomed to summon the miserable fellow who, before visiters, played the
                  part of his Turkish attendant. The latter made his appearance, and, having
                  received from his master certain hasty and whispered instructions, he gave a nod
                  of intelligence and retired.</p>
               <p>This done, the Spaniard returned to the room where the mother and son were
                  enjoying an interview whose sanctity we will not invade—nor is it<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000013"/> at all necessary that we should do so.</p>
               <p>After surveying them for a few minutes with a look of intense scorn, hatred and
                  baffled rage, Lopez the Spaniard said—</p>
               <p>"Happy meeting of a precious pair! Mother and son—ha, ha, ha!—The
                     <unclear>mether</unclear>, the former mistress of a notorious felon; the son,
                  an escaped prisoner and branded Outlaw! I wish you both joy of this encounter, so
                  unexpected to both, and, evidently, so extremely gratifying."</p>
               <p>"Beware, villain!" cried Jack, advancing towards him, menacingly, with the
                  dirk-knife—"provoke me not to do an act which would instantly consign your
                  blackened soul to the flames of hell! Why did you plot to have me slay my mother?
                  Could the oath of vengeance which you have sworn against me, be satisfied with
                  nothing less than that?</p>
               <p>"Malediction!" exclaimed the Spaniard, with sudden rage—"that I should be thus
                  cheated of the sweetest morsel of revenge that I ever prepared for my longing
                  lips! God! what a triumphant fulfilment of my oath, boy, to have had you hung for
                  the murder of your mother! But no matter; you shall swing for the murder of
                  Captain Douglass, the head jailor. Do you hear? you shall swing for it, I
                  say."</p>
               <p>"Peace, ruffian!" cried Jack—"or with this weapon, furnished me by yourself for a
                  horrible purpose, I will cut off your blasphemous tongue and dig out your vile
                  heart!—Come, mother," he added, turning to the lady, whose bosom swelled with
                  emotion on being addressed by that title, of all others the most tender and
                  beautiful—"let us leave the den of this villainous impostor, and seek a purer
                  atmosphere. I will keep the promise which I gave you, and abandon my course of
                  crime forever."</p>
               <p>"God grant it, my son," sobbed the unfortunate lady; and, leaning on Jack's
                     <unclear>arm</unclear>, she passed into the larger room and approached the door
                  leading to the passage.</p>
               <p>"Hold!" cried the Spaniard, regarding Jack with a venomous look, such as the most
                  malignant demon in hell might have envied—"hold! we part not thus easily. You
                  shall not yet go hence, neither shall you quit your career of crime."</p>
               <p>"Out of the way, reptile!" said our hero, scornfully—"the presence of my mother
                  here alone prevents me from teaching you a lesson in the science of vengeance, of
                  which, with all your cunning, you have no conception."</p>
               <p>"I repeat it," said the Spaniard, with a peculiar look—"you cannot depart
                  hence."</p>
               <p>"Fool! who will prevent me?" demanded our hero, scornfully.</p>
               <p>"The officers of justice!" thundered the other—"I hear their footsteps upon the
                  stairs, even now. They are here. To me you are indebted for your escape; and to me
                  also shall you be indebted for your re-capture."</p>
               <p>At this moment the door was thrown violently open, and Rimser, the jail turnkey,
                  made his appearance, followed by a police officer and two or three watchmen. The
                  poor turnkey looked pale and haggard; the sudden and awful death of pretty Nell
                  Douglass, the head jailor's daughter, pressed heavily upon his soul, and rendered
                  him the most miserable of men.</p>
               <p>He pointed at Jack, who was immediately taken into custody. The unfortunate mother
                  looked on, her eyes streaming with tears.</p>
               <p>"Calm yourself, dear mother," said Jack—"we shall meet again."</p>
               <p>"Yes," muttered the Spaniard—"you <emph>shall</emph> meet again, but it will be
                  when you, Jack, are preparing for the scaffold!"</p>
               <p>This brutal remark was unheard by the others.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Rimser,' said our hero, in a tone of deep commiseration—'pray inform me, sir,
                  is Captain Douglass dead?"</p>
               <p>"He is not," was the reply—"although desperately wounded, and exhausted by loss of
                  blood, the physician gives it as his decided opinion that he will recover."</p>
               <p>"Thank God!"? exclaimed Jack, fervently.</p>
               <p>"Captain Douglass not dead—likely to recover!" thought the Spaniard, deeply
                  disappointed—"perdition! In that case there is no immediate prospect of Jack's
                  being swung. My usual good fortune seems to have deserted me; for on all sides I
                  meet with nothing but disappointment."</p>
               <p>Our hero again addressed the turnkey, in faltering accents—</p>
               <p>"And—and—Miss Douglass—is she——"</p>
               <p>"She is dead," said poor Rimser; and, brushing away a tear, he gave orders for
                  Jack's removal to jail.</p>
               <p>At the earnest entreaty of our hero, one of the watchmen, an elderly, respectable
                  looking man, promised to conduct Miss Cooper in safety to the hotel at which she
                  and her parents were stopping. The parting between the mother and son was deeply
                  affecting to all present, with the exception of the Spaniard, who now experienced
                  another disappointment; for the arch villain had cherished the hope of being able
                  to retain Miss Cooper as a prisoner in his house—make her the object of his
                  hellish passions, and vent upon her inoffensive head all the malignant hatred
                  which he cherished towards her son.</p>
               <p>When, therefore, he saw her depart from the house, under the protection of a
                  worthy man whose sterling integrity he knew to be superior to all bribery, he
                  ground his teeth in secret and impotent rage.</p>
               <p>Jack was conveyed back to the jail from which he had so recently escaped. He was
                  not of course placed in the same cell from which he had broken out, but was
                  accommodated with temporary lodgings in a large cell wherein several other
                  prisoners were confined. On account of its massive structure, this cell was known
                  as the "<hi rend="i"/>Strong Room," and escape from it was deemed impossible.</p>
               <p>In the Strong Room was Jack locked up, and left to the enjoyment of his own not
                  very agreeable meditations.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">A GENTLEMAN IN DIFFICULTIES.</head>
               <p>Stretched upon a rude couch of straw, our hero soon fell into a feverish and
                  uneasy slumber, from which he did not awaken until the beams of the morning sun,
                  straggling in through the grated windows, played upon his face.</p>
               <p>He started up, rubbed his eyes, and for a few moments his bewildered senses
                  comprehended not the realities of his situation. Soon, however, the mists that
                  obscured his mental vision were dispelled, and he began to appreciate the
                  disadvantages of his position, to their fullest extent.</p>
               <p>He recollected all the events of the last few hours, and could not restrain his
                  tears as he thought of his poor mother, to whom he had been united for so brief a
                  season, and from whom he had been separated under such painful circumstances.
                  Then, when his mind dwelt upon the melancholy and tragical fate of the unfortunate
                  Nell Douglass, a feeling of profound sorrow took possession of his soul; for he
                  considered himself as having been the involuntary cause of her death at the hands
                  of her father.</p>
               <p>His own prospect he contemplated with feelings of the deepest despair; for well he
                  knew that his having attempted to take the life of the head jailor—leaving the
                  bank robbery entirely<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8051-00000014"/> ly out of the
                  question—would in all probability consign him to a prison cell for the remainder
                  of his life.</p>
               <p>He sat down upon his miserable bed and, in order to divert his thoughts from the
                  painful channel into which they were beginning to flow, he began to examine the
                  cell, its appointments, and its occupants.</p>
               <p>It was lighted by two grated windows, and was in a tolerable state of cleanliness.
                  Besides his own bed, there were three other beds, each of which was tenanted by a
                  fellow captive.</p>
               <p>One of these individuals was awake, and eyed our hero with considerable curiosity
                  and interest. He was a long, lean, gaunt fellow, forty-five or fifty years of age,
                  with a grizzly beard and a shock of dirty hair. His entire appearance proclaimed
                  him to be a member of the extensive fraternity of <emph>loafers.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>This gentleman lay in bed with his solitary blanket drawn close up to his chin;
                  and, as the said blanket chanced to be of exceeding brevity, his feet and the
                  lower parts of his legs were entirely uncovered.</p>
               <p>There was something so irresistibly comic in the man's situation and appearance,
                  that Jack, in spite of his grief and despair, could not help laughing.</p>
               <p>"Ah, you may well laugh, young feller," said the strange gentleman, in a tone
                  which partook 'more of sorrow than of anger'—"you see before you a feller critter
                  that has experienced many reverses of fortune—one that has been high in office,
                  and in the confidence of his fellow-citizens, but now is, by the inscrutable
                  decrees of Providence, actually destitute of a shirt.—Young feller, take warning
                  by my fate; avoid the path of sin and death before it is too late. Beware of the
                  flowing bowl, and lay up your treasures in heaven. Have you got any tobacco about
                  you?"</p>
               <p>Jack courteously replied that he did not use the article, a circumstance which (he
                  said) he regretted, as he was thereby prevented from supplying the wants of his
                  new friend.</p>
               <p>"Ah, no matter," said the strange gentleman; and then he added, with a thoughtful
                  air—"I s'pose that you haven't got such an article as a quarter of a dollar about
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have," answered our hero, who was beginning to be much amused with the
                  fellow.</p>
               <p>"Have you though?" exclaimed the strange gentleman; and the intelligence seemed to
                  be so agreeable to him, that he brightened up amazingly—"I s'pose that you'd
                  object to lending that trifling coin to a perfect strarger?"</p>
               <p>"By no means," said Jack, as he good-naturedly produced and handed over the
                  'trifling coin' in question—. "I am always happy to accommodate a gentleman in
                  difficulties."</p>
               <p>"Come to my heart, my best, my dearest friend!" cried the gentleman in
                  difficulties, as, in a transport of gratitude he leaped out of bed and embraced
                  our hero with a fervor that was rather annoying than otherwise.</p>
               <p>With considerable difficulty, Jack extricated himself from the clasp of his
                  affectionate friend, whose remark in reference to his being destitute of a shirt
                  was not merely metaphorical; for he was indeed minus that useful article of
                  raiment, and now stood in a condition of perfect nudity.</p>
               <p>"Be not surprised at my appearance, friend of my soul," said the shirtless
                  gentleman, as he proceeded to invest himself in a suit of clothes which had
                  attained the last degree of shabbiness—"holy Nature demanded food, and I disposed
                  of my shirt for the benefit of my stomach; and now I am like the last rose of
                  summer which was left blooming alone, with all its lovely companions stepped out
                  and gone!"</p>
               <p>"Pray, sir, what are you confined here for?" inquired Jack, as he narrowly
                  regarded the strange gentleman; for it occurred to him that they had met
                  before.</p>
               <p>"I am accused," replied the other, looking hard at our hero—"of a deficiency in
                  the quality of integrity; of an inclination to indulge in practices of dishonesty;
                  in short," cried the strange gentleman, with a burst of indignation—"I am charged
                  with purloining a leg of pork!"</p>
               <p>"But you are innocent, of course," remarked Jack, dubiously.</p>
               <p>"Innocent!" exclaimed the strange gentleman, smiting his breast in a manner to
                  indicate that it was the abode of unsullied honor—"innocent! Is the unborn babe
                  guiltless? Is the moon chaste? Is the snow-drop pure? Is the heaven holy?
                  Innocent! Well, <emph>I'll</emph> bet I am!"</p>
               <p>It is impossible to describe the air of proud and mournful dignity with which the
                  strange gentleman denied the truth of the odious charge preferred against him.</p>
               <p>The longer Jack looked at his new acquaintance, the more he became convinced that
                  he had known him before. At length a sudden remembrance flashed upon his mind, and
                  he abruptly inquired—</p>
               <p>"Pray, is not your name <hi rend="i"/>Piggot?"</p>
               <p>The strange gentleman evinced considerable surprise, and admitted that his name
                     <emph>was</emph> Piggot.</p>
               <p>"Were you not formerly the overseer of the New York House of Refuge?" asked
                  Jack.</p>
               <p>"I once had the honor of occupying that proud and exalted position, young feller,"
                  replied the other, with sudden dignity—"but how did you become acquainted with my
                  name and former occupation?"</p>
               <p>"First tell me," said Jack—"by what reverses of fortune you became reduced from
                  that 'proud and exalted position,' as you call it, to your present deplorable
                  situation. Then I will tell you my name, and I think that we will prove to be old
                  acquaintances."</p>
               <p>"The tale of my downfall is a melancholy one," said Mr. Piggot, dolefully shaking
                  his head, whose 'knotted and combined locks' betrayed its innocence of all
                  knowledge of a comb.—"Our party got defeated, and of course every one that held an
                  office got kicked out; myself among the rest. In vain did I declare that I loved
                  my country better than my wittles or my life; in vain did I express my willingness
                  to die upon the altar of that country, if necessary, and shed my hearts' blood
                  with a perfect looseness. It was all <emph>no go;</emph> 'leave!' was the word,
                  and leave I did. Ah, young feller! it would have did your soul good to have heard
                  the howls of anguish, and seen the tears of sorrow, of my poor bereaved children,
                  which was under my care, when I announced to them that I announced to them that I
                  should be obliged to leave them to the care of a stranger; for I was a father and
                  mother to them all, and they knew it. As a last token of my love, I flogged them
                  all 'round; and left them bathed in tears. Ah! them beloved youngsters will never
                  get another over-seer over them like me!"</p>
               <p>"I don't think they will," remarked Jack, drily. "What did you do, after your
                  removal from the office of overseer?"</p>
               <p>"I went into the <emph>swearing</emph> business, replied Mr. Piggot, with an air
                  of honest pride.</p>
               <p>"The swearing business! what the devil is that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's very easy. When a feller got into trouble of any kind, and got into the
                     <emph>jug,</emph> he had only to send for me, slip a five dollar bill into my
                  hand, and then I'd go before the magistrate that committed him, and <unclear>tail
                     him</unclear> out, by swearing that I was worth ten or twenty thousand dollars.
                  That's what is called giving straw bail—it's almost as good as
                     <unclear>leg</unclear> bail."</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8051-00000015"/>
               <p>"But had you really any property?"</p>
               <p>"Not a cent. People called such swearing, <emph>perjury;</emph> and I was finally
                  compelled to abandon the business, through fear of getting into the State
                  Prison."</p>
               <p>"What did you do next?"</p>
               <p>"Went into the <emph>mock auction</emph> business which paid very well for a short
                  time, until the infernal police, which is always meddling with a man's bread and
                  butter, came down on the game, and blocked it, by stationing fellers in front of
                  all the mock auction shops, bearing a sort of a wooden banner, on which was
                  painted, in large letters—'Beware of Mock Auctions!'"</p>
               <p>"Then you are what is called a <hi rend="i"/>Peter Funk?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. It was my duty to lounge around the auction room, and by bidding freely
                  myself, encourage the green ones to bid. Every day I appeared in a different
                  disguise—sometimes I was a farmer, sometimes a sailor, then again a marine, or a
                  mechanic; and sometimes, but not often, I appeared in the character of a
                  gentleman."</p>
               <p>"That, I should think, was the most difficult part of them all for
                     <emph>you</emph> to play."</p>
               <p>"Ahem! Young feller, don't let the fact of my being in your debt to the extent of
                  a quarter of a dollar, encourage you in the belief that I can be insulted with
                  impunity. I'd have you to know that I was formerly a prominent New York
                  politician, and——"</p>
               <p>"There, I apologize for my remark," interrupted Jack, who was anxious to hear the
                  remainder of Mr. Piggot's history—" proceed with your narration."</p>
               <p>"When I could no longer assist in the disposal of brass rings and galvanized
                  watches, I turned my attention to some other means of support. A feller of my
                  genius didn't have to search a great while for employment. But my fortunes were on
                  the decline, and the business that I next went into wasn't near so respectable as
                  them which I had been following. I am almost ashamed to make the humiliating
                  confession; my cheeks burn with shame while I state the fact; but I became——"</p>
               <p>"What?" demanded Jack, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Reporter for a daily newspaper.</emph>" replied Mr. Piggot, with a deep
                  groan, and averting his face.</p>
               <p>A brief pause ensued, and the exoverseer resumed—.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was installed as reporter for the '<title>Daily Dose and Diddler's
                     Journal.</title>' From that moment I lost all self-respect, and became what you
                  now see me—a ruined, broken-hearted, and perfectly used-up man!"</p>
               <p>Mr Piggot wept, wiped his eyes on his coat-sleeve, and continued his
                  narration:—</p>
               <p>"From morning till night I travelled about, collecting items for the 'Daily Dose.'
                  When there was a scarcity of news, I manufactued it; often have I, on paper,
                  perpetrated a murder, a rape, or a suicide, in order to procure the means of
                  getting a dinner—a meal which was beginning to be very scarce with me. Ah, young
                  feller! the many lies that I was obliged to tell, when I was a reporter, sit heavy
                  on my conscience!"</p>
               <p>The idea of Mr. Piggot's having a conscience was so particularly absurd, that Jack
                  could not refrain from laughing. The ex-overseer proceeded:—</p>
               <p>"Finally, my moral scruples got to be so strong, that I abandoned the profession
                  in disgust; but I shall never forgive myself for having been guilty of such
                  voluntary degradation, as to allow myself to become reporter for a daily
                  paper'"</p>
               <p>"What was your next business?"</p>
               <p>"The drama, I went upon the stage."</p>
               <p>"The devil you did!"</p>
               <p>"Fact, upon my most sacred and unsullied honor. I became an obscure but useful
                  member of the profession. I removed chairs and tables from the stage, and once,
                  with singular success, personated the Dragon in a Christmas pantomime.
                  Occasionally I bore a banner, or a spear—and all for the modest consideration of
                  three dollars per week and the privilege of the negro gallery. I might have done
                  well, but for one fatal, fatal circumstance."</p>
               <p>"What was that, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Young feller, the Demon Alcohol made me his victim. Three cent nippers was the
                  cause of my ruin. One night, while playing the part of a <unclear>Holy</unclear>
                  Father in the church, I fell down upon the stage dead drunk, and was carried off
                  by a carpenter and the call-boy. I was conveyed home in a wheel-barrow, and the
                  next day was dismissed from the theatre with startling abruptness;—in other words,
                  I was kicked out by the stage manager."</p>
               <p>And after that?"</p>
               <p>I became a reformed drunkard, and lectured on temperance. But this didn't last
                  long; the brethren soon discovered that I didn't drink liquor, but poured it down;
                  and they hustled me out of their ranks. After this, I tried preaching and quack
                  doctoring; but it was no go—I could get neither hearers nor patients. I very soon
                  got to be out of money, out of credit and out at the elbows; in short—I blush not
                  to own it, for poverty is no disgrace—I became a loafer of the seediest kind. One
                  fine morning, after passing the night under a fish-stall in the Catharine Market,
                  I made a light breakfast at one of the street pumps, and fell into deep meditation
                  on my condition and prospects. It is plain, thought I, that merit such as mine
                  ain't appreciated in New York; I'll go to Philadelphia, which may open a field for
                  the exercise of my talents. So I stole a passage across the Hoboken ferry, took
                  the turnpike road, and footed it to this city, begging my grub as I came along
                  When I arrived here I couldn't find any opening for the display of my genius, and
                  I have since been living, as the saying is, from hand to mouth.—Sometimes I have
                  lodged at the establishment of Johnny Cox, and——"</p>
               <p>"I have the pleasure of being slightly acquainted with that gentleman,"
                  interrupted Jack—"so you were one of his patrons?"</p>
               <p>"Just so. New you see, young feller, the ungrateful and shameful manner in which I
                  have been treated by this here city of Philadelphia; instead of taking me to its
                  bosom and shoving me into some good office it violates every rule of hospitality
                  and common politeness, by putting me in jail upon the absurd charge of purloining
                  a leg of pork!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Piggot here finished his 'strange eventful history;' and Jack thus addressed
                  him—</p>
               <p>"Piggot, I can scarcely wonder that you do not recollect me, for time has altered
                  my appearance. I have good reason to remember <emph>you</emph> however; for your
                  brutality to me, when I was an inmate of the Refuge and in your power, can never
                  be forgotten. Can you not call to mind the name of Jack Harold?"</p>
               <p>The ex-overseer gazed at our hero for a few moments with a bewildered expression
                  of countenance; and then, rushing towards the former victim of his cruelty, as if
                  to embrace him, he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"It is—it is the darling youth of my soul! Come to my arms, thou whom I have ever
                  regarded with a father's love!"</p>
               <p>Jack repulsed his affectionate friend with a movement indicative of disgust. The
                  ardor of Mr. Piggot, however, was not to be thus extinguished. Producing a
                  delapidated and very unclean pocket handkerchief, he began to dry his imaginary
                  tears, and give vent to his agitated feelings.</p>
               <p>"To think," said he—"of meeting my beloved young friend, after so long<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8051-00000016"/> a separation, and under such
                  circumstances! One also, that I was a father and mother to, and that was so
                  ungrateful as to run away from me twice!"</p>
               <p>"Take care how you stir up such recollections, villain!" cried Jack, sternly—"or I
                  may be tempted to avail myself of this most excellent opportunity to repay you, in
                  part, for your damnable cruelty to me, in former times. I still bear upon my
                  person marks of the lash, inflicted upon me by <emph>you.</emph> Your present
                  miserable situation is the just reward of your villainy; as it is, I scorn to take
                  vengeance upon one so wretched and degraded."</p>
               <p>Here the occupants of the other two beds, who were awake and had been listening to
                  the foregoing conversation, signified their approval of Jack's remarks by a low
                  chuckle of satisfaction; whereupon Mr. Piggot, enraged at the idea of their
                  enjoying themselves at his expense, 'pitched into' the nearest lodger with the
                  utmost ferocity; and as the lodger happened to be an elderly individual, of feeble
                  frame, he would in all probability have received severe personal damage, had not
                  Jack relieved him of his assailant, by knocking the latter down. As the
                  ex-overseer fell, his head came in violent contact with the corner of an iron
                  bed-stead; and he lay, stunned and bleeding, upon the floor.</p>
               <p>At this moment, the door of the cell was thrown open by a turnkey, who beckoned
                  our hero to come out. Jack obeyed, and having followed the official through a long
                  and gloomy corridor, he was shown into a small cell about six feet square,
                  containing nothing but a straw bed and a rude wooden bench. There was no window;
                  and only a dim light was admitted through a small crevice in the iron door.</p>
               <p>Jack shuddered as he entered this gloomy dungeon, which so much resembled a
                  tomb.</p>
               <p>"Here you are to remain," said the turnkey—"until your trial, which will come on
                  soon, as the court is now sitting. They are only waiting until Captain Douglass
                  gets well enough to testify against you. It will go hard with you, young man."</p>
               <p>"But why am I placed in this infernal hole?" demanded Jack, indignantly—"why could
                  I not remain where I was?"</p>
               <p>"You are such a slippery chap," replied the turnkey, with agrin—"that we dare not
                  trust you even in the <hi rend="i"/>Strong Room. Besides, it is too much
                  indulgence for you to have company. Solitude, and bread and water, are necessary
                  to bring you to a proper sense of your condition. You won't escape from
                     <emph>this</emph> cell, my young friend."</p>
               <p>"You are perfectly sure of that, I suppose?" said Jack, with the utmost
                  indifference.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'll take my oath of it," rejoined the turnkey, with the air of a man who
                  weighs his words, and is well satisfied of their correctness.</p>
               <p>"We shall see," said our hero, as he threw himself upon the straw bed as if
                  desirous of taking a nap.</p>
               <p>The turnkey now took his departure, after having double locked the massive
                  door.</p>
               <p>Jack abandoned himself to feelings of the most profound despair. Hope had, for the
                  time, entirely deserted him, and he might have said, in the words of Addison's
                     <title>Cato</title>— <q>

               <p>Days passed away, and still Jack Harold remained the inmate of that gloomy
                  dungeon. Twice every day did the turnkey make his appearance with the prisoner's
                  allowance of bread and water, and, upon every such occasion, the petty official
                  regarded our hero with a grin of triumph, as if to say—"Ah, ha! my fine fellow
                  we've got you now!"</p>
               <p>But, meanwhile, Jack was not idle. His natural buoyancy of spirits returned, and
                  he set himself about forming some plan of escape from that dreary place, and from
                  the consequences of his probable conviction.</p>
               <p>As we before observed, there was no window; and, being without tools of any kind,
                  it was impossible for him to operate upon the door. Therefore, he was obliged to
                  resort to a plan of the most daring, desperate and dangerous character.</p>
               <p>Pretending to be very ill, he kept his bed continually; and, whenever Gruff, the
                  turnkey, came with his food, that gentleman was invariably saluted with a chorus
                  of the most dismal groans from the prisoner, who seemed to be suffering all the
                  agonies of the most dreadful sickness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gruff, being a gentleman of phlegmatic temperament, and rather hard-hearted
                  withal, at first took no notice of these 'signals of distress;' but at length,
                  fearing that the prisoner might die on his hands through neglect, he condescended
                  to ask our hero what ailed him?</p>
               <p>Jack, with many contortions, intimated that his bowels were in an awful state, in
                  consequence of the unaccustomed coarseness of his diet; and concluded by
                  expressing a fervent wish that he was dead and comfortably buried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gruff, firmly believing the prisoner to be dangerously unwell—and thinking,
                  moreover, that his illness was entirely occasioned by the coarseness and
                  insufficiency of his food—so far relaxed from the severity of the jail discipline
                  as to furnish Jack with certain nourishing broths and light wines calculated to
                  recruit his strength, from the same benevolent motive which induces a butcher to
                  fatten a hog, preparatory to the slaughter of the ill-fated animal.</p>
               <p>Although these savory viands were most welcome to our hero, in contrast with his
                  usual fare of bread and water, the object which he had in view, in feigning
                  sickness, was of far greater importance than the mere acquisition of wholesome and
                  nourishing food, as we shall see presently.</p>
               <p>Jack pretended to be too weak to arise in order to take his food; and therefore
                  the unsuspecting turnkey would come to his bed-side and administer the same, with
                  a care and patience which were alone prompted by a desire to get the prisoner into
                  a fit condition to appear before the court, which was then in readiness to proceed
                  with his trial, as Captain Douglass had recovered sufficiently to testify against
                  him.</p>
               <p>One dark and stormy afternoon, when he imagined that everything was ripe for the
                  hazardous enterprise which he had in view, Jack leaped out of bed with a vigor and
                  agility quite surprising on the part of a person affecting to be completely
                  prostrated by sickness. Having assured himself that there was no spy peeping
                  through the crevice in his door—for, since his confinement in that cell, he had
                  more than once detected the sharp eyes of Mr. Gruff stealthily gazing in upon
                  him—he rapidly divested himself of his clothing, which he had continued to wear
                  both day and night, not choosing to bring his tender skin in contact with the
                  rough and somewhat dirty blankets of his bed. Taking a couple of these blankets,
                  he stuffed his clothes with them, thus forming a sort of effigy of himself. This
                  figure he placed in the bed, threw a blanket over it in a careless manner, and
                  then patiently awaited the arrival of the turnkey, with his evening repast.</p>
               <p>Our hero had now no other garment on but his shirt; and, as the cell was<pb
                     n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8051-00000017"/> both cold and damp, he soon began to
                  suffer considerably; yet his stout heart, and the hope of achieving his liberty
                  sustained him.</p>
               <p>As evening came on, and the time for the turnkey's appearance drew nigh, the
                  ordinary darkness of the cell increased, and every object within it was enveloped
                  in a dim obscurity most favorable to the prisoner's hopes.</p>
               <p>At length Jack heard the heavy tread of his jailor approaching; and, with a
                  beating heart, he crouched down in a dark corner nearest to the door.</p>
               <p>The key rattled in the lock; the heavy bolts flew back, and the massive door swung
                  open upon its iron hinges.</p>
               <p>The turnkey entered, and, as usual, approached the prisoner's bed.</p>
               <p>Jack glided out of the cell as noiselessly as a cat.</p>
               <p>"Come, young fellow, rouse up; here's your supper," said Mr. Gruff, as be gently
                  shook the figure in the bed.</p>
               <p>Quick as lightning, Jack closed the cell door and turned the key, which had been
                  left in the lock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gruff gave utterance to a fearful oath, for he instantly saw the trick which
                  had been played upon him.—Dragging the image from the bed, he bestowed upon it a
                  tremendous kick, as if to chastise it for its having assisted to deceive him.
                  Then, well knowing the futility of attempting to force open the door, he made the
                  cell resound with loud cries of—"A prisoner escaped! stop him! stop him!"</p>
               <p>Fortunately for Jack, the cell was in a corner of the jail so very remote, that
                  there was but little probability of the turnkey's cries being heard by those for
                  whose ears they were uttered.</p>
               <p>Running swiftly along the corridor, our hero soon came to the great door which
                  guarded it. This door, having been left open by the turnkey, proved no obstacle in
                  the way of Jack, who now found himself standing in the jail vard, an area of
                  considerable extent, surrounded by a stone wall of great height.</p>
               <p>A cold and drizzling rain was falling; and, as the young Outlaw was in almost an
                  entire state of nudity, it is easy to conceive that his situation was far from
                  comfortable. Besides he knew that even should he succeed in scaling the wall and
                  gaining the street beyond, his nakedness would expose him to the fearful risk of
                  being re-captured and returned to his old quarters—a catastrophe which he
                  naturally contemplated with the utmost horror. If Richard was willing to give his
                  "kingdom for a horse," Jack, in his present emergency, would most assuredly have
                  thanked propitious fortune for the temporary loan of a pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Although shivering with cold, and drenched to the skin, hope did not abandon him;
                  on the contrary, his courage and capacity seemed to expand, in proportion to the
                  critical nature of his position.</p>
               <p>While groping about in the profound darkness, endeavoring to devise some means of
                  getting over that that formidable wall, which, towering above him, seemed like an
                  impassable barrier between him and liberty, he stumbled against a huge ladder
                  which had been left in an upright position against the jail, by some workmen who
                  had been engaged in making certain repairs and alterations upon the roof of the
                  building.</p>
               <p>Imagine with what transports of joy he discovered this means of escape from his
                  dangerous situation! His feelings at that moment resembled those of the
                  ship-wrecked mariner, who, from the barren and desolate rock upon which he has
                  been cast, sees for the first time an approaching sail, and cherishes the blessed
                  hope of being rescued from an awful, lingering death by famine.</p>
               <p>To mount this ladder was but the work of a few moments; and Jack stood upon the
                  flat roof of the jail.</p>
               <p>Upon one side of this building, as the reader is aware, was situated the house
                  inhabited by Captain Douglass, the head jailor. On the other side, and immediately
                  adjoining, was a large and handsome edifice, occupied by a wealthy and
                  aristocratic family.</p>
               <p>To pass from the jail to the roof of its more agreeable neighbor, was a very easy
                  matter, both buildings being of precisely the same height.</p>
               <p>Without much difficulty, Jack managed to effect an entrance into the rich man's
                  house, through a cupola which adorned its summit. Descending cautiously, and in
                  the midst of the deepest darkness, he finally groped his way into an apartment
                  which seemed to be a bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>The means by which our hero had gained access to this house, irresistibly reminded
                  him of his mode of entrance to the residence of the jailor, upon the occasion of
                  his former escape; and he could not forbear breathing a fervent hope that his
                  present daring enterprise, unlike the other, might be unattended with bloodshed.
                  Since his interview with his mother, under the extraordinary circumstances
                  detailed in a former chapter, we will do him the justice to say that he had formed
                  a resolution to abandon forever his course of crime; in this determination he was
                  perfectly honest and sincere, but his dark and relentless fate seemed to be bent
                  upon his ruin and destruction, notwithstanding the strong desire of his soul to
                  reform. <q>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE LADY AND HER ANXIOUS PHYSICIAN.</head>
               <p>That the apartment into which Jack had managed to grope his way, was furnished
                  with extreme luxury was evident; for his feet pressed a carpet of extraordinary
                  thickness and softness, and his extended arms came in contact with various
                  articles of furniture which he knew to be of a magnificent and costly
                  description.</p>
               <p>To secure suitable clothing, and then depart unnoticed from the house, was now his
                  great object.</p>
               <p>To accomplish this, he began to search about for the entrance to a closet or
                  dressing-room in which clothing was likely to be kept.</p>
               <p>This search was successful. He soon discovered a door, and opening it, he entered
                  a room around the walls of which was suspended a profusion of garments. These
                  appeared to be of an elegant and fashionable kind—but, unfortunately, they were
                  all the garments of a <emph>lady;</emph> not a single article of male wearing
                  apparel was to be found.</p>
               <p>Under these circumstances, Jack resolved to sustain a female character until such
                  time as he could procure clothes more appropriate to his sex. Accordingly, he was
                  proceeding as best he could in the darkness, to array himself as one of the fairer
                  portion of creation, when he heard the sound of approaching footsteps. In great
                  consternation, he hastily closed the door of the dressing-room, and awaited the
                  result with the most intense anxiety. As this door was of glass, screened by a
                  curtain drawn partially aside, he was enabled to witness whatever might transpire
                  in the adjoining bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>A gleam of light now shone into this chamber, proceeding from a wax candle held by
                  a lady, who entered with a quick and elastic step. She was followed by a
                  gentleman, who carefully turned the key in the door. His nervous and agitated
                  manner seemed to announce a degree of eager delight, in which the lady shared,
                  although there was visible in her looks a shade of hesitation and fear.</p>
               <p>Having placed the light upon the table<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8051-00000018"/>
                  ble, the lady threw herself upon a sofa, and the gentleman seated himself at her
                  side.</p>
               <p>Jack had now an opportunity of taking a hasty survey of the chamber. We will not
                  inflict upon the reader a tedious and detailed description of the place, for such
                  an account would be neither necessary nor desirable; suffice it to say that every
                  article contained in that splendid apartment was a perfect gem of luxury and
                  art—every rare and beautiful thing was there which could be procured by unbounded
                  wealth, or suggested by the most refined taste. The low and voluptuous French bed,
                  with its magnificent counterpane of white satin embroidered with flowers, and its
                  cloud of overhanging drapery of spotless hue and most charming delicacy of
                  texture—that couch, worthy the soft slumbers of a fairy, particularly attracted
                  our hero's admiring gaze. It reminded him of the theatre of love's joys, wherein
                  he and Kate had in former times passed so many hours engaged in soft and amorous
                  dalliance. That recollection, even then, caused his pulses to throb and his blood
                  to boil. Yet, when he thought of Kate's desertion, this excitement subsided, to
                  give place to feelings of rage.</p>
               <p>By way of improving his time, and availing himself of the light which now shone
                  into the dressing-room, Jack continued with noiseless haste to array himself in
                  dainty female attire, taking care to select the most costly and elegant garments.
                  He was sufficiently well versed in all the divine mysteries of a lady's toilet to
                  perform his task with a tolerable degree of accuracy and case.</p>
               <p>While thus engaged, however, he stole frequent glances into the chamber for the
                  purpose of watching the progress of the lady and gentleman; while not a single
                  word which they uttered, escaped his ears.</p>
               <p>We have become so weary or describing the charms of the actresses of our drama,
                  that in the present instances we shall merely observe that this lady was a
                  remarkably fine-looking woman young and voluptuous in the extreme. Yet her rather
                  coarse mouth expressed sensuality, while her bold and wanton eyes amply confirmed
                  that expression. Her companion had a decidedly <emph>professional</emph> air; he
                  was a gentleman of middle age, and rejoiced in a very respectable reputation as a
                  fashionable physician.</p>
               <p>By listening to the conversation of these parties, we may perhaps be enabled to
                  judge of the relations existing between them.</p>
               <p>Dr. Chatelle—for such was the name of the medical gentleman—contemplated his
                  beautiful companion with an enamoured gaze; while she, either feeling or affecting
                  embarrassment, began to trace numerous intricate figures upon the rich carpet,
                  with the point of her delicate satin slipper.</p>
               <p>Whatever might <emph>then</emph> have been the wishes and intentions of this pair,
                  it was evident that they had never before met in secret; for their actions
                  betrayed that timidity which is perhaps inseparable from a <emph>first
                     amour.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The lady was the first to break the silence, which was beginning to be rather
                  awkward:—</p>
               <p>"Dr. Chatelle will perhaps deign to inform me why he has requested a private
                  interview?"</p>
               <p>"Does that request excite within you emotions either of displeasure or surprise?"
                  demanded the physician, respectfully, but in a slightly reproachful tone.</p>
               <p>"I confess that I am somewhat surprised. Why could not this interview take place
                  as well in the presence of my husband, as in my chamber? Is it proper for us to be
                  alone—and <emph>here?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly. I am your family physician, and any intercourse between us, under
                  all circumstances, is sacred. My position—our relative situations—will admit of
                  the most unbounded privacy vacy between us, without the slightest infringement of
                  propriety."</p>
               <p>"But, granting all this—why have you summoned me here?"</p>
               <p>"I wish to have a private and confidential conversation with you. I am interested
                  in your welfare. You are unhappy."</p>
               <p>The lady sighed. The doctor continued:—</p>
               <p>"How can you be otherwise than unhappy, my dear Mrs. Delaplaine, united as you are
                  to a man old enough to be your grandfather—an old dotard, whose filthy gold
                  purchased your <unclear>divine</unclear> person from mercenary
                     <unclear>parents."</unclear>
               </p>
               <p>"You are severe, sir."</p>
               <p>"I speak the truth, <unclear>madame, and</unclear> you know it,"
                     <unclear>rejoined</unclear> the doctor, who, being a man of the world, hoped
                  that a little specious argument would gain his point. He recollected the
                  proverb—"the woman who hesitates, is lost."</p>
               <p>The physician proceeded:—</p>
               <p>"Your husband, my dear Mrs. Delaplaine—your <emph>nominal</emph> husband, I should
                  say, for he cannot be your husband in fact—is an aged and impotent man, worn out
                  by the excesses of his youth. He is afflicted with various diseases, among which
                  is that fashionable and excrutiating malady, <emph>the gout.</emph> These render
                  him cross, peevish, exacting, troublesome, and eminently disagreeable. Your time
                  is consumed by your attendance upon his whims; you are the constant object of his
                  ill humor. Nor is this all: he has become habitually intemperate in the use of
                  wine, and even now, propped up in his easy chair in the drawing-room below, he is
                  sleeping off the effects of a protracted sitting after dinn er, as it is
                  called."</p>
               <p>"Alas! sir, it is true," sighed the lady.</p>
               <p>"How can such a man contribute to the happiness or enjoyment of a woman like you,
                  gifted by nature with the most tender sensibility, the most ardent passions, and
                  the most abundant capacity for unlimited indulgence in the ineffable delights of
                  matrimony—those joys to which you are an utter stranger, in consequence of your
                  unnatural connection with this odious and imbecile old wretch?"</p>
               <p>The costly lace which covered the lady's well-developed bosom, was agitated by the
                  profound sigh elicited by the doctor's artful and exciting words</p>
               <p>The physician saw that he was making rapid progress towards the consummation of
                  his wishes, and continued, with enthusiasm—</p>
               <p>"I plainly perceive, my dear madam, that your health is seriously affected by your
                  unhappy position—a wife, without a husband. The most deplorable consequences
                  invariably result from nature's unsatisfied longings. The glitter of your eyes,
                  and the deep glow upon your cheeks, although they enhance your beauty, betray an
                  unhealthy fever in your blood. It was in order to consult you in regard to this
                  most important matter, that I ventured to demand a private interview—for the
                  subject is of too much delicacy to discuss in the presence of others."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Delaplaine bowed, and averted her head in order to conceal the burning
                  blushes which suffused her cheeks. Dr. Chatelle said—</p>
               <p>"Suffer me to examine your pulse."</p>
               <p>She extended her white and jewelled hand, and the fingers of the physician toyed
                  amorously with the beautiful wrist. This contact thrilled through both their
                  frames like an electric shock.</p>
               <p>"Ah, madam," said the doctor—"this pulse beats far too rapidly, and requires to be
                  moderated. You are in a far more critical state than I had imagined. Ha! you seem
                  to breathe with difficulty; can it be possible that your chest or lungs, is
                  affected? Allow me—<emph>professionally,</emph> you know——"</p>
               <p>The doctor's hand gently—almost imperceptibly—glided up that soft and naked arm,
                  and insinuated itself beneath the gauze-like covering of that<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000019"/> luxurious bust. There it remained.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, Jack Harold—who had lost none of the details of the foregoing scene,
                  which he enjoyed hugely—had completed his toilet, and was now ready to take his
                  departure as soon as the lady and her <emph>anxious</emph> physician should vacate
                  the bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>And now the parties, enfolded in a close embrace, began to exchange the most
                  passionate kisses. These were soon followed by still more ardent demonstrations;
                  the doctor whispered in the lady's ear, and the pair disappeared behind the snowy
                  drapery which veiled that voluptuous couch.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE AGED HUSBAND AND THE YOUNG WIFE.</head>
               <p>An hour passed, during which our hero suffered all the agonies of an extreme
                  impatience to depart, to say nothing of the mad excitement of feeling created by
                  his reflections concerning the manner in which the lady and the doctor were
                  employed.</p>
               <p>At the expiration of that hour, the amiable pair made their appearance—the
                  estimable Mrs. Delaplaine much flushed in face and disordered in attire, while the
                  countenance of the respectable Dr. Chatelle wore an expression of triumph.</p>
               <p>The lady re-arranged her ruffled plumage at the mirror, and then prepared to
                  accompany her gallant down stairs.</p>
               <p>The doctor bestowed upon her an affectionate kiss, and whispered—</p>
               <p>"Henceforth, dearest, we must seek many such golden opportunities."</p>
               <p>"I am wholly yours," was the murmured response of the lady, as she abandoned
                  herself to the embrace of her lover with an air which bespoke a feeling of languid
                  voluptuousness.</p>
               <p>In a few moments they quitted the chamber, carrying with them the light.</p>
               <p>Jack now cautiously issued from the dressing-room, and having groped his way to
                  the door of the chamber, passed out, and cautiously descended the stairs leading
                  to the principal hall of entrance.</p>
               <p>One of the doors communicating with this hall was slightly ajar. Urged by an
                  invincible spirit of curiosity, notwithstanding the dangers of his situation, Jack
                  paused at this door and stealthily gazed into the apartment.</p>
               <p>Two persons were there—the beautiful but frail Mrs. Delaplaine, and her aged
                  invalid husband, the <emph>millionaire.</emph> The fortunate Dr. Chatelle had
                  discreetly taken his departure.</p>
               <p>The lady was seated at a distance from her "liege lord," and seemed to be occupied
                  with thoughts that were both novel and pleasing.</p>
               <p>Old Delaplaine was reposing in a large easy chair. He was propped up with pillows,
                  and his gouty foot, of enormous dimensions, rested upon a cushioned foot-stool. He
                  was a shrivelled, grey-haired old man of seventy, with a countenance expressive of
                  great ill humor and irritability, though flushed with the rosy hue of wine.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, this old man seemed to awaken from an uneasy slumber, and in a sharp,
                  petulant voice he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Julia! where are you, Julia?"</p>
               <p>"I am here," said the lady, rising and coming towards him.</p>
               <p>"Curses on my head! it will burst asunder with pain. Give me some drink, for I am
                  parched with thirst. Million devils! can't you move more quickly?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Delaplaine poured out a bumper of choice Burgundy, and presented it to her
                     <emph>husband,</emph> who drank eagerly.</p>
               <p>The delicious beverage refreshed the old wretch, and imparted a temporary warmth
                  to his icy blood; for he encircled his wife's beautiful waist with his withered
                  arms, and said, or rather croaked—while his ugly old face assumed an amorous
                  expression that was absolutely disgusting—</p>
               <p>"Ah, ha! July! you look lovely as an angel to-night; and you are all my own—mine,
                  mine! How many a young buck, now—yes, young and handsome, too, who would laugh at
                  the old man—how many such, I say, would give their right hands to be allowed to
                  clasp this delicious waist, as I do now! But you wouldn't let them, would you—hey?
                  You'd scorn, them, July, if they wanted you to prove unfaithful to your old man,
                  wouldn't you—hey?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," murmured the lady, with difficulty concealing her strong disgust. Old
                  Delaplaine patted her on the back with a sort of feeble, lazy rapture.</p>
               <p>"Good girl—good girl!" croaked he—"I only wish that I was—just—a
                     <emph>little</emph> younger, say a year or two. Not that I'm old now; by no
                  means. I'm just in the prime of life, as one might say. I have many years to live
                  yet; so you mustn't expect to be left a rich young widow very soon, my dear. I
                  haven't the least intention of dying. With the exception of this accursed gout,
                  I'm well enough. Yet I wish that I was a <emph>very</emph> little younger, for
                  both our sakes. Ah, well, well; you're very pretty, July; kiss me."</p>
               <p>The lady, almost shudderingly, pressed her ripe, moist lips to his withered cheek,
                  to the great delight of the old dotard, who continued to talk on:—</p>
               <p>"Ah, ha! many a young man would give a thousand dollars for that sweet kiss; but
                  you would'nt sell a kiss, for love or money, would you, July—hey? No one shall
                  kiss you, except me; shall they, hey? Many young gallants—handsome fellows,
                  too—were after you; I know it; but <emph>I</emph> bore off the prize, in spite of
                  them all. My money bought you of your poor, miserable devil of a father, who
                  hadn't a copper—hey? You're wholly mine, because I've paid for you—ha, ha,
                  ha!"</p>
               <p>It was a horrid laugh. Mrs. Delaplaine's fine eyes blazed with indignation at the
                  brutality of the speech; and the angry reply which she would have made was alone
                  restrained by the reflection that her amour with Dr. Chatelle amply revenged the
                  insults of the old wretch. She now blamed herself for not having sooner engaged in
                  an intrigue as an agreeable and much-desired solace for the misery of her
                  matrimonial condition, united as she was, by the terms of a mercenary marriage, to
                  an <emph>impotent,</emph> petulant and abusive old man.</p>
               <p>Surely, under such circumstances, there is some excuse for a woman when she is
                  tempted to go astray by a man possessing every desirable qualification in which
                  her "husband" is lamentably deficient? We believe that the generality of women
                  prefer to be the "slaves" of young men, (in a <emph>certain sense,</emph>) rather
                  than the "darlings" of impotent old dotards.</p>
               <p>A sudden shriek of agony, arising from the lips of old Delaplaine, alarmed the
                  lady, and even started Jack, who was an invisible spectator or the foregoing
                  scene. An intensely painful twinge of the gout had caused this cry of torture.</p>
               <p>As usual with him in such cases, the chivalrous Mr. Delaplaine—who was, and always
                  had been, a prodigiously mean man, in every sense of the word, vented his anger
                  and spleen upon the head of his young wife.</p>
               <p>"Curse you!" he cried, with concentrated rage, as he attempted to strike
                  her—"hussy! wretch! you have trod upon my gouty foot! Go—go; leave me; you are
                  hateful in my sight. You are no companion for me; you are a wretch—a prostitute,
                  for what I know!"</p>
               <p>The lady could restrain herself no longer; her indignation rendered her<pb
                     n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8051-00000020"/> superb y beautiful, as she exclaimed, in
                  thrilling tones:—</p>
               <p>"And if I <emph>am</emph> a prostitute, does not your brutality, your impotence,
                  and your disgusting person, justify in me a departure from virtue's course?—It is
                  time that we should understand each other; know, then, miserable old man! that I
                  loathe the very sight of you—the very atmosphere which you breathe seems
                  pestilential to me! Nay, more than this—since you have aroused me to make the
                  confession—know that I have already, this very night, sweetly avenged my wrongs by
                  indulging in a delicious amour with a young, handsome and accomplished man. Yes! a
                     <emph>man,</emph> who deserves that proud title, and whose person, compared
                  with yours, is as the gallant eagle contrasted with the unclean vulture! Yes,
                  within an hour—in this house—in my bed-chamber—have I and my gallant lover——"</p>
               <p>She paused, for a sudden and frightful change was visible in the old man's face.
                  Jealousy and rage had produced an awful effect upon that feeble frame, broken down
                  by old age, disease and excessive indulgences. His tongue was powerless to give
                  utterance to the tempest of wrath which swelled within him. His eyes seemed to be
                  starting from their sockets, and the rushing blood caused his countenance to
                  assume an almost sable hue. Tossing his arms wildly, as if clutching at the
                  intangible air, he at length gave utterance to a deep groan, and fell forward upon
                  the carpet. On partially raising him up, the lady discovered that he was dead.
                  Apoplexy had claimed him as its victim.</p>
               <p>Although Mrs. Delaplaine cordially detested her aged husband, his sudden and awful
                  death inspired her with such feelings of horror, that she swooned.—Jack, who ever
                  had an eye to business, took advantage of this circumstance to glide into the room
                  for the purpose of appropriating to his own use such articles as might tend to the
                  replenishing of his purse. From the body of the old man he took a valuable gold
                  watch and a well-filled wallet; and then, from the tempting lips of the
                  unconscious lady, he stole an amorous kiss—for the incorrigible young dog could
                  not restrain the ardent propensities excited by the lady's beauty, even in the
                  presence of death. There is no telling how much further he might have gone, had he
                  not been startled by the abrupt entrance of one of the servants; a very pretty and
                  buxom lass, who almost screamed with astonishment when she beheld the
                  extraordinary group.</p>
               <p>Jack, with his usual presence of mind, remembered that he was in female costume,
                  which, by the way, became him singularly well, on account of his fine form and the
                  delicate beauty of his countenance.</p>
               <p>Assuming an air of dignity, and an effeminate voice, he approached the astonished
                  servant maid and said—</p>
               <p>"Do not be at all alarmed, my good girl; your master has only fallen in a fit, and
                  Mrs. Delaplaine has swooned. I was merely paying them an evening visit, being an
                  old friend and school-fellow of the lady. Do what you can to revive them both;
                  and, meanwhile, I had perhaps better go for a physician. Have the kindness to show
                  me out of the house."</p>
               <p>Completely deceived by the air of perfect nonchalance assumed by our hero, the
                  servant obeyed, and Jack found himself in the open street, dressed in female
                  attire, and with the rain pouring upon him in torrents.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">A STRANGE ADVENTURE.</head>
               <p>"Devilish pleasant!" muttered the young Outlaw, as he threaded his way through the
                  wet and almost deserted streets—"here am I, dressed as a lady of high fashion,
                  wandering I know not where, and liable to be insulted, and perhaps
                  outraged—ahem!—by any lustful ruffian with whom I may chance to come in contact.
                  Confusion! how it rains' My silk and satin finery will be completely spoiled; and
                  this "love of a Parisian bonnet," which has so often shrouded the fine eyes of the
                  beautiful Mrs. Delaplaine, is already ruined past all redemption. How gladly would
                  I exchange these splendid garments for the coarsest description of male clothing!
                  However, I am free, and must trust to luck for the rest.—As for the matter of
                  funds, I am in a tolerably flourishing condition; and if I am so fortunate as to
                  escape the vigilence of inquisitive Charleys—the whole race of whom may the devil
                  confound—then is 'Richard himself again!'"</p>
               <p>Thus mentally soliloquizing, Jack hurried onwards, with the intention of seeking
                  lodgings at some humble tavern, in the character of a "female in distress,"
                  trusting to his own ingenuity for the manufacture of a plausible story in
                  explanation of his situation. It suddenly occurred to him that the "<hi rend="i"
                  />Red Ball Tavern" of Mr. Cox might, under the circumstances, afford him a safe
                  temporary place of refuge, where he could easily procure male clothing. Therefore,
                  notwithstanding the strong feelings of repugnance which he entertained towards
                  that far from respectable establishment—to which he had been once introduced by
                  his deceased friend <hi rend="i"/>the Ribber—he proceeded in that direction, for
                  he felt that he had no other alternative.</p>
               <p>To his great satisfaction, the rain had now entirely ceased, and the dim rays of
                  the incon began to struggle feebly through the clouds which had so long obscured
                  her surface.</p>
               <p>While tripping lightly along, with all the grace appropriate to his assumed
                  character, and highly elated at having regained his liberty Jack was so
                  unfortunate as to encounter a party of half-drunken rowdies, who were making night
                  hideous with their yells and snatches of bacchanalian songs.</p>
               <p>An unprotected female, in the streets of Philadelphia, at night, who may chance to
                  fall into the hands of any of the ruffians who are continually prowling about,
                  need expect no mercy at their hands. Insult, violence and outrage are the three
                  words which express the sort of treatment she is destined to receive. Even the
                  company of a male friend is no adequate protection for her; the gentleman is
                  perhaps beaten until he is senseless, after which the unfortunate lady is
                  subjected to usage still more brutal and fiend-like. Upon such occasions, the
                  frantic shrieks of the poor victim very rarely brings any one to her assistance.
                  As to the valiant city watch, they generally take good care to remove themselves
                  to a safe distance from the scene of outrage, not wishing to come in contact with
                  a class of miscreants whose desperate character is proverbial throughout the whole
                  Union. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Suing to these men were as the bleating</l>
                        <l>Of the lamb to the butcher, or the cry</l>
                        <l>Of seamen to the surge."</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Jack Harold was well aware of all this; and, although in reality he was no
                  "unprotected female," yet as he appeared in the character of one, and was very
                  desirous of preserving his secret, no wonder that his meeting with these midnight
                  gentry created within him considerable alarm.</p>
               <p>Hoping to escape their notice, he glided into a dark passage-way, intending there
                  to remain until they should have passed.</p>
               <p>But, alas! they had seen the flutter of a lady's dress and, like bloodhounds on
                  the scen of a fugitive, they rushed after our hero.</p>
               <p>Their leader—a singularly repulsive looking villain, with red hair—seized the
                  supposed lady with an iron grass and exclaimed, with many oaths—</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8051-00000021"/>
               <p>"We've caught the bird, by G—! She's fair game, and good picking; look at her
                  plumage—silk and satin, or <emph>I'm</emph> a liar! One of the upper crust
                  night-walkers, I suppose. This dark alley is the very place for us; and remember,
                  fellers, I am first. Now, Miss Highflyer, or whoever else you may be, please to
                  keep your mouth shut, or you you'll get your head caved in, that's all!"</p>
               <p>Jack instantly recognized the voice of <hi rend="i"/>Carrotty Tom the
                  locksmith—the fellow who had betrayed him and his companion the Ribber, in the
                  affair of the bank robbery. Although, upon that occasion, Tom had been dangerously
                  injured, he had recovered, probably in order that he might grace a halter at some
                  future time; and he had resumed his villainous career, notwithstanding that he was
                  a coward of the most despicable description; never venturing abroad unless with a
                  crowd at his heels, and seldom daring to molest any except defenceless women.</p>
               <p>On making this discovery, Jack's blood boiled with rage, and had he possessed a
                  weapon, he would have slain the villain upon the spot.</p>
               <p>With many a fierce oath and threatening gesture, this gang of ruffians gathered
                  close around our hero, who, notwithstanding the dangers of his situation, could
                  scarcely refrain from laughing at the oddity of the adventure. He determined, if
                  possible, to put an end to the affair at once, more especially as Carrotty Tom had
                  begun to make certain familiar investigations which may better be imagined than
                  described.</p>
               <p>Judge, therefore, the astonishment of the last-named gentleman, upon receiving
                  from the supposed female a kick in the stomach of such precision and vigor, that
                  his internal arrangements were seriously disturbed, and he fell back senseless
                  into the arms of his companions.</p>
               <p>It was now a matter of life and death with Jack to escape from the hands of his
                  enemies. His way to the street being intercepted, he <unclear>took</unclear>
                  advantage of the temporary confusion of the rowdies to run rapidly up the passage,
                  trusting to find some other outlet. It being intensely dark, he ran with some
                  violence aginst a door, which yielded to the shock and flew open. The fugitive
                  rushed in, and quickly succeeded in securing the door by means of a stout
                  bolt.</p>
               <p>The rowdies, who had hotly pursued our hero, now found themselves completely
                  baffled; and although they thundered and kicked against the door, its strength
                  defied all their efforts, and they failed in effecting an entrance.—The noise
                  attracted a small party of the city police to the spot, and these officers—more
                  vigilant, courageous and efficient than the watch—soon dispersed the ruffianly
                  crew, who imagined themselves cheated of a delicate morsel of female loveliness.
                  They went off cursing and swearing; but none cursed or swore louder than Carrotty
                  Tom, whose digestive organs had received the most severe injury.</p>
               <p>We now return to Jack. The door through which he had passed, just in time to "save
                  his bacon," led into a small garden, situated in the rear of a house of modest but
                  respectable appearance. The tremendous noise made by the rowdies was overheard by
                  the only inmate of this mansion, who was a middle-aged widow lady in comfortable
                  circumstances, and of the most unblemished reputation.</p>
               <p>Alarmed at the unusual disturbance in the immediate vicinity of her quiet domicil,
                  and wishing to ascertain the cause thereof, this amiable lady—upon whom her late
                  husband had bestowed the very <emph>uncommon</emph> name of Smith—appeared at the
                  threshold of her door, bearing a light. The first object that met her astonished
                  gaze was a drooping figure arrayed in elegant but disordered female attire, and
                  having the appearance of a beautiful young lady.</p>
               <p>'Who are you, miss, and how came you in my garden?" demanded the worthy Mrs.
                  Smith, in great astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, madam, for my intrusion," replied the stranger, in a feminine and very
                  musical voice—"I fled hither to escape from the insults of a party of ruffians
                  whom I encountered in the street. If you will but have the kindness to afford me a
                  temporary shelter, I will explain everything to your entire satisfaction."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith was a woman, and a very kind one at that; how could she, then, resist
                  such a touching appeal from one of her own sex,(!) uttered in accents the most
                  melodious and refined?</p>
               <p>"Come in, poor creature," said she "your misfortune is a direct passport to my
                  heart and hearth. You shall be cordially welcome to such hospitalities as my
                  unpretending home may afford. Even if you are frail, you are none the less a
                  sister, and entitled to a woman's sympathy. Come in, my dear girl, and I will do
                  what I can to make you comfortable."</p>
               <p>These kind words were uttered in a tone of such genuine benevolence, that the
                  disguised young Outlaw was deeply affected, and hesitated a few moments ere he
                  made up his mind to accept the good lady's offer. Should <emph>he,</emph> a
                  fugitive from justice, branded with crime, and fresh from a felon's cell—should
                     <emph>he</emph> take advantage of that excellent woman's unsuspecting kindness
                  of heart, and intrude his polluted presence into her pure abode? And yet there was
                  no other alternative; therefore, overcoming his scruples, be briefly expressed his
                  gratitude, which was really sincere; and, remembering that he was now to play his
                  assumed part before the experienced eyes of a female, he determined to bring into
                  play all the grace and art of which he was so abundantly possessed in order that
                  the lady might not suspect his true sex.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith, with many expressions of sympathy and condolence, conducted the
                  disguised robber into a small apartment which was furnished with taste and even
                  elegance. The most exquisite neatness and order prevailed; and upon the hearth
                  cracked a cheerful wood fire, for the night was damp and cold. Everything was
                  exceedingly cozy and sung, indicating the comfortable circumstances of the
                  blooming widow, and her desire to enjoy the good things of this world to their
                  fullest extent.</p>
               <p>Jack seated himself in a luxurious arm chair before the fire, while the lady
                  busied herself in preparing refreshments for her interesting stranger guest. Our
                  hero had now for the first time an opportunity of scrutinizing the personal
                  appearance of his hospitable hostess; and he was surprised to find that she was a
                  very handsome and attractive woman—for he had expected to behold nothing less than
                  an ugly old widow, or a superannuated old maid</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith was "fat, fair, and"—<emph>not</emph> "forty;" for her age still
                  lingered within the ripened precincts of thirty-five, the glowing summer of female
                  life, in very many cases. Nay, we have seen women in the autumn of life—forty—far
                  more voluptuously beautiful than many of the delicate and undeveloped flowers of
                  girlhood. But, alas! those well-preserved specimens are rare. Family cares and
                     <emph>duties</emph> inordinate vanity, and tight lacing, play the very devil
                  with the women of the present day. Mrs. Smith, then, was thirty-five. We said she
                  was "fat;" but the word is odious and vulgar, and we retract it. Infernal word!
                  which always brings to us visions of Falstaff, apoplexy and hogs lard! The
                  expression must have been invented by some malignant pork butcher. Let our modern
                  lexicographers at once and forever expunge it from all the dictionaries—it
                     pollutes<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8051-00000022"/> the English vocabulary—it
                  smells rank, and fishy! It gives to the sensitive stomach a villainous twinge; and
                  oh! breathe it not into the ear of him who is afflicted with sea-sickness!—Say
                     <emph>obese—corpulent</emph>—anything; but not fat! Certain students of
                  Shakspeare assert that Hamlet was fat; but a million Princes of Denmark, inky
                  cloaks and all, could never render the word classical.</p>
               <p>The shape of Mrs. Smith—what a name for a heroine!—was decidedly buxom; you might
                  have spannd her waist with your aim, but then that arm would be rather
                  inconveniently full, though not <emph>unpleasantly</emph> so; for what the devil
                  can there be unpleasant in clasping the well-formed waist of a pretty woman,
                  though she be as fat——we mean, as plump, as Mr. Daniel Lambert himself?</p>
               <p>Buxom, then, was Mrs. Smith in shape, and fair in complexion, with a skin as soft
                  and smooth as satin; so, at least, her late husband was wont to declare over his
                  fourth tumbler of punch—and he, of course, was an excellent authority on that
                  subject.</p>
               <p>The liberality of nature towards Mrs. Smith enabled her to dispense entirely with
                  many <emph>bustling</emph> appendages which ladies too frequently affect. No
                  cotton padding was needed to impart to her bust a luxurious swell; all was firm,
                  and genuine, and particularly <foreign xml:lang="FRA">recherche.</foreign> Nature
                  had to her been very generous indeed.</p>
               <p>Her face was unexceptionable; eyes, teeth, lips, cheeks, nose and hair, all united
                  to form one of the most charming countenances in the world. Her smile was witchery
                  itself—her voice the essence of all music. Byron himself would have been in
                  raptures with the smallness, whiteness and delicacy of her hands, which were
                  unadorned save by a single plain mourning ring. She was dressed with all the
                  modesty simplicity and elegance which became her years, circumstances and
                  position.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">JACK'S ROMANCE.</head>
               <p>Such was Mrs. Rosalia Smith, the widow of a moderately wealthy merchant—a woman
                  possessing beauty without vanity, wit without malice, a winning manner without
                  coquetry, amiability without affectation, and true benevolence without the
                  slightest particle of ostentation.</p>
               <p>This good lady, having prepared a light but excellent repast, invited our hero to
                  partake thereof. Jack, being very hungry, did not require a second bidding, but
                  did full justice to the meal. At its termination, he cast his eyes upon the carpet
                  with an air of modest diffidence, and said:—</p>
               <p>"In return for your kindness, madam, it is but just that I should state, freely
                  and unreservedly, all the particulars of my situation, and explain the
                  cirucmstances under which I was compelled to intrude into your garden tonight, and
                  solicit a temporary shelter in your hospitable abode."</p>
               <p>"I wish to extort no confessions from you, my dear young lady," said Mrs. Smith,
                  with a smile of ineffable sweetness—" for your appearance fully assures me that
                  you are not one of the fallen sisterhosd, as I was at first inclined to suspect.
                  However, if you choose to give me your confidence, I shall be much pleased to
                  listen to your story."</p>
               <p>Jack's powers of imagination were quite equal to those of a modern novelist; and
                  he had therefore but little difficulty in "making up" the following romance, which
                  he delivered with an air of ingenuousness that seemed to bear the impress of
                  truth:</p>
               <p>"My story, madam, is short and simple, and its relation will detain you but a few
                  minutes. I am the only daughter of a gentleman occupying a respectable position in
                  a government office at Washington. My mother died a year ago; and, since the death
                  of that dearest, best of friends, I have been indeed alone in the world.——Madam,
                  excuse these tears, and pity my weakness; would that I were with my angel mother,
                  in Heaven!"</p>
               <p>"Take comfort, my dear young lady," said the sympathizing Mrs. Smith—"and pour
                  your sorrows into the bosom of a friend. Your words, no less than your appearance,
                  have inspired me with interest. Regard me in the light of a mother, my child."</p>
               <p>As Jack looked at the amiable and beautiful woman, so full of quiet elegance and
                  soft voluptuousness, he thought that he had much rather take her as a mistress,
                  than as a mother.—He continued:—</p>
               <p>"My father is one of the most worldly of men, ambitious to attain political
                  distinction, and very desirous of accumulating wealth. Affection for his only
                  child has no place in his cold and mercenary breast. So far from treating me with
                  tenderness, he exhibits towards me the utmost harshness and severity."</p>
               <p>"Poor, unhappy child!" murmured Mrs. Smith; and, overcome with sympathy for a
                  young lady so unfortunate, she folded the interesting stranger to her bosom.</p>
               <p>Encircled by her warm and loving arms, and with a pair of luscious lips pressed
                  affectionately to his, Jack could with difficulty refrain from abandoning himself
                  to the intoxicating feelings which his exciting situation naturally aroused.
                  However, he controlled himself by a powerful effort, and resumed his fanciful
                  narration:—</p>
               <p>"A few months ago, an elderly gentleman, high in station and renown, whose fame as
                  a statesman is tarnished by the abundance of his private vices, was introduced to
                  me at a fashionable party; he is a widower, and immediately began to persecute me
                  with his addresses. I at once, and with decision, rejected his suit; for I had
                  involuntarily conceived towards him a strong dislike, and determined never to be
                  his. Still he persisted; and finally, seeing that I would not listen to his
                  proposals, he appealed to my father, who immediately espoused his cause, and
                  demanded of me, with an air of almost savage indignation, what I meant by refusing
                  to marry so distinguished and wealthy a man as the Hon. gentleman, who was in
                  every respect a most desirable match for me' I replied that the man, besides being
                  of an unsuitable age, was personally repulsive to me; and therefore that I never
                  should consent to become his wife."</p>
               <p>"Courageous girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Smith, whose womanly instincts caused her to be
                  deeply interested in this tale of the imagination. Our hero continued:—</p>
               <p>"Enraged at this avowal of my resolution not to comply with his wishes, my father
                  abused me in the most cruel manner, and emphatically declared that I should be
                     <emph>forced</emph> into obedience. I replied only by a scornful smile, which
                  rendered him furious, and he so far forget himself as to descend to personal
                  violence towards me, his own child. Yes—that unnatural parent raised his arm, and
                  struck me senseless to the floor!"</p>
               <p>Jack—artful dog!—purposely introduced this tragic clause in order still more to
                  excite Mrs. Smith's sympathy, and elicit from her another affectionate
                     <emph>maternal</emph> caress—a stroke of policy which proved eminently
                  successful; again was he fondly pressed to that luxurious bosom, and again did he
                  taste the nectar of those rosy lips, which breathed words of tender
                  condolence.</p>
               <p>"When I recovered from the effects<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8051-00000023"/> of
                  this violence," continued the pretended young lady in distress,—"I found myself
                  locked up in my chamber. A message soon reached me from my father, to the effect
                  that he had fixed the date of my marriage with the Hon. Mr. ——, at exactly one
                  month from that day, at which time he was determined that I should be united with
                  the object of <emph>his</emph> choice, even if I had to be dragged to the altar.
                  Meanwhile, I was to be kept closely confined in my chamber, and allowed to see no
                  one whatever except a cross old woman who was to bring me my meals.</p>
               <p>"Conceive, dearest madam, the horrors of my situation! A prisoner in the house of
                  a cruel father—excluded from all sympathy, without a friend, and forced to
                  contemplate the possibility of my union with a man whom I detested!</p>
               <p>"Alas! <emph>then</emph> did I feel most poignantly the loss of that tender and
                  most excellent mother, whose influence might have shielded me from the evils with
                  which I was threatened, and whose breast would have pillowed my aching head."</p>
               <p>By way of illustrating the manner in which the imaginary mother would have
                  "pillowed his aching head," our audacious young rascal reclined upon the bosom of
                  his beautiful listener, and remained in that very comfortable situation.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith entreated him to proceed, and he obeyed:—</p>
               <p>"Fired with indignation by the cruel and arbitrary treatment of my father, I
                  determined to flee from a roof which was no longer a home for me, and trust rather
                  to the cold charity of the world than to the protection of a harsh and unnatural
                  parent. Not to weary you, madam, with unnecessary details, I will merely say that
                  I succeeded in making my escape; and having come to this city, I sought a
                  temporary home at the abode of a distant female relative of my mother's. This
                  relative received me with kindness, and strongly urged me to remain with her
                  permanently. Beneath her hospitable roof I might have enjoyed that happiness to
                  which I have so long been a stranger, had not my relentless fate decreed it
                  otherwise."</p>
               <p>"What new calamity overtook you, my poor girl?" asked Mrs. Smith, kindly.</p>
               <p>"A very great calamity, in the shape of my cruel father, who, suspecting my place
                  of refuge, arrived here this evening, from Washington. Two hours ago, while seated
                  in the comfortable parlor of Mrs. Frederickson—my mother's relative—I was
                  frightened almost out of my senses by the abrupt entrance of my father. Foaming
                  with rage, and uttering fierce curses, he upbraided me for my conduct in
                  clandestinely leaving his paternal roof; and then, having exhausted all his powers
                  of abuse, he imperiously commanded me to make immediate preparations for my return
                  with him to Washington; adding, that as a punishment for my undutiful and
                  scandalous conduct, I should be compelled to marry the Hon. Mr. ——before the
                  expiration of another week. Not daring to make any reply, I bowed my head as if in
                  token of obedience; and then, ascending to my chamber, I hastily threw on my
                  bonnet and shawl and secretly left the house, not knowing nor caring where I
                  should go, so long as I was beyond the reach of my tyrant father. The rain
                  drenched me to the skin, as I wandered through the streets, a poor and friendless
                  outcast. It was my misfortune to encounter a band of lawless and riotous men, who
                  treated me rudely and doubtless would have subjected me to the grossest outrage,
                  had not a merciful Providence directed my flying footsteps up the passage-way
                  which leads to your garden. Fortunately, I was enabled to pass through the gate
                  and to secure it, thus effectually baffling my pursuers, whose noise attracted ed
                  your notice, my dear madam; and coming to ascertain the cause of the disturbance,
                  you beheld <emph>me</emph>—a poor and friendless intruder upon your premises. You
                  did not spurn me, as many would have done, who, judging from circumstances and
                  appearances, might not unnaturally suppose me to be a wanton. No; you received the
                  poor stranger with a smile of welcome and with the warmest hospitality, for which
                  may Heaven forever bless you."'</p>

               <head type="sub">JACK AND THE WIDOW.</head>
               <p>Warm and tender was the embrace bestowed by the lady upon the "interesting
                  stranger," at the conclusion of this very affecting narrative; and Jack's close
                  proximity to that fine woman, combined with her unconsciously exciting caresses,
                  began to create within him feelings which might endanger the preservation of his
                  secret.</p>
               <p>Philosophers in affairs of love assert that there is a nameless charm in the
                  amorous relations which may exist between a youth in his teens, and a woman of
                  mature age. Be that as it may, the handsome Mrs. Smith, with her winning softness
                  of manner, beauty of countenance and voluptuousness of shape, inspired our hero
                  with desires as ardent as had ever been excited even by the magnificent "Gallus
                  Kate."</p>
               <p>"Be comforted, my dear girl!" said Mrs. Smith—"you are here safe from the pursuit
                  of your tyrannical father."</p>
               <p>"Alas, madam!" cried the young impostor, who was struck with a sudden idea—"you
                  know not my father's savage malignity and invincible perseverance. He will make
                  the most strenuous efforts to discover the place of my retreat; and once again in
                  his power, I am lost. Madam, I cannot remain in Philadelphia, for I dread being
                  continually tormented by fears of re-capture. To-morrow I shall leave this city
                  for New York, where I have friends who will afford me shelter and protection. Nay,
                  do not oppose this resolution, I entreat you; it will be for my welfare to do as I
                  have said."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, you must act as you think best; and, although I should be happy to
                  have you remain beneath my roof, as a companion and friend, still my wishes must
                  not interfere with your interests. I trust that at some future time we may be
                  enabled to enjoy the delights of social intercourse without any fear or
                  restriction."</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant it!" responded our hero, whose ideas of the "delights of social
                  intercourse" with Mrs. Smith were of a nature which would perhaps have astonished
                  that virtuous and pure minded lady, just at that particular time.</p>
               <p>"I have a plan," continued Jack—"which I will submit to your consideration, and,
                  if it meets with your approval, I will adopt it. My father will not hesitate to
                  employ any means, no matter how harsh or unjust, which he may consider likely to
                  place me again in his power. I fear that he may issue advertisements concerning
                  me, describing my person, and offering a liberal reward to any one who shall
                  furnish such information as may lead to the recovery of his "runaway daughter."
                  Now, in order to enjoy additional security, in my journey from this city to New
                  York, I have thought that it would be an excellent plan for me to disguise myself
                  in <emph>male attire.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith reflected for a few moments, and then said—</p>
               <p>"I approve of this plan, my dear; for, although it may shock your delicacy to
                  assume the garments of a man, still it is best to do so in order to provide
                  against the possibility of your being restored to your cruel father."</p>
               <p>"I am glad that you approve of it," exclaimed our hero with unfeigned<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000024"/> joy; for he had anticipated some opposition to his
                  plan from the fastidious lady, who had never "worn the breeches," even during the
                  life-time of her worthy husband.</p>
               <p>"But how, dear madam, shall I procure the necessary clothing?" inquired the artful
                  impostor, with some appearance of anxiety.</p>
               <p>"How very fortunate!" cried Mrs. Smith, as a smile of satisfaction illumined her
                  charming countenance—"it is the very thing! Give yourself no uneasiness, my dear,
                  on the score of your disguise; we shall not have to go far in order to fit you out
                  in the most complete and admirable manner."</p>
               <p>"What mean you, dear madam?"</p>
               <p>"Listen. I have a nephew, about eighteen years of age, who is being educated at an
                  academy in Germantown. He usually spends his vacations with me, for he has no
                  parents; and as I shall probably never marry again," (here the lovely widow
                  blushed and sighed,) "he will inherit what little property I possess. Well—this
                  nephew is now at his academy, but a considerable portion of his clothing is here,
                  and as I have the keys of his trunks, I shall have no difficulty in selecting from
                  his really extensive and fashionable wardrobe, every article which may be required
                  to convert you, my dear, into a young gentleman of the most unexceptionable
                  exterior. When he pays his next visit, and hears what I have done, he will feel
                  honored and highly pleased, at the idea of his having, although involuntarily,
                  obliged so beautiful and fascinating a young lady as yourself."</p>
               <p>"This kindness, dear madam, merits and shall receive my eternal gratitude," said
                  Jack, who was overjoyed at this prospect of speedily resuming the garments
                  appropriate to his sex.</p>
               <p>"Say no more, my dear," rejoined Mrs. Smith—"in this affair I am merely acting as
                  the agent of my nephew Augustus. It is perhaps fortunate that he is not here in
                  person, for the sight of so charming a creature might play sad havoc with his
                  susceptible heart."</p>
               <p>"Ah, madam! you flatter me," said our hero, who really began to feel somewhat
                  embarrassed by the lady's compliments and delicate attentions. The part which he
                  was playing was an extremely difficult one, but he had all along sustained it with
                  a skill and address that would have reflected credit upon the most accomplished
                  actor. The unsuspecting nature of Mrs. Smith, and her easy credulity, had also
                  materially assisted him in carrying out the imposture with success; although a far
                  more penetrating observer than the good lady, might have been deceived as she
                  was.</p>
               <p>Although conscious of the excellence of his performance, Jack grew weary of his
                  part, and longed to terminate the farce. This impatience might have originated in
                  his ardent desire to be embraced in his own true character, by that singularly
                  attractive and fascinating woman. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Oh! how impatience gains upon the soul,</l>
                        <l>When the long promis'd hour of joy draws near!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"I do not flatter you," said Mrs. Smith, in answer to our hero's last words—"but
                  enough of that. Since we have both determined that you shall become a gallant
                  cavalier, suppose that we repair to the chamber occupied by my nephew when he is
                  here, and there make a selection of suitable garments, and see if you can secure a
                  tolerable fit. However, if you are too much fatigued, we can postpone the
                  examination until to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Oh, let us go now, by all means!' exclaimed the young impostor, eagerly; for the
                  lady's proposition was in exact accordance with his most earnest wishes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith smiled her assent, arose gracefully from her seat, took a light, and
                  requested the supposed young lady to follow her. Jack obeyed, with a wildly
                  palpitating heart.</p>
               <p>The lady led the way into a large <unclear>and</unclear> handsomely furnished
                  bed-chamber. The peculiar tastes of Master Augustus, its occasional occupant, were
                  very strikingly manifested by various articles which lay scattered around. Here
                  was a pair of boxing gloves; there, a watchman's rattle, and the brass knocker of
                  a street door—the former wrested from some vanquished Charley, and the latter
                  unlawfully wrenched from the habitation of some peaceable member of the Society of
                  Friends. In one corner lay a pair of theatrical buskins, a sword, a plumed hat,
                  and a spangled mantle; for, in addition to his many other accomplishments, Master
                  Augustus was afflicted with Shakspeare, and belonged to an amateur theatrical
                  club. The young gentleman was evidently also a connoisseur in female beauty, for
                  the walls, besides being adorned with a picture of a prize fight between "Buffer
                  Donnelly" and another pugnacious gentleman with an unpronouncable name, were
                  ornamented with several rather loose paintings of ladies possessing great beauty
                  and but slight costume.</p>
               <p>Perceiving that her companion regarded these different objects with some
                  curiosity, Mrs. Smith said, with some confusion of manner—</p>
               <p>"Such articles, my dear, are certainly inappropriate things to be found in the
                  house of a respectable widow lady; but allowance must be made for the tastes of a
                  wild youth, whose exhuberance of spirits will sometimes lead him into folly,
                  although he hasby no means a bad heart. He was never properly reared by his
                  parents, and I have neither the strength nor the courage to attempt his reform,
                  which is perhaps impossible. However, I have strong hopes that when he has "sown
                  his wild oats," as the saying is, he will become a sober and respectable member of
                  the community. His kind and affectionate treatment of me, always effectually
                  disarms me when I begin to reprove him for some act of folly which never
                  degenerates into positive wickedness. As he seems to take pleasure in these silly
                  things which you see here, I have not the heart to disturb them, and accordingly
                  suffer them to remain, although those pictures, I must say, are decidedly
                  objectionable. Don't <emph>you</emph> think so?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam," modestly replied Jack, who had been contemplating with a flushed
                  countenance a superb painting representing a group of naked wood nymphs, engaged
                  in amorous sport.</p>
               <p>The lady, meanwhile, had been stealthily regarding a picture of the Apollo
                  Belvidere, whose glorious proportions had ofton excited her admiration, and caused
                  her widowed bosom to swell with feelings which she found it difficult to resist.
                  For this pure and excellent woman had inherited a liberal share of those passions
                  which are inseparable from humanity.</p>
               <p>"Come, my dear; let us examine my nephew's wardrobe," said she.</p>
               <p>Producing a bunch of keys, she proceeded to unlock various bureaus and trunks,
                  from which she took a great quantity of garments, all of the finest material and
                  most fashionable make; for Master Augustus was an exquisite of the first water,
                  and prided himself upon the elegance of his attire, although he was indebted to
                  his generous aunt for the means of procuring it.</p>
               <p>Jack saw at a glance that the clothing would fit him to a nicety; and warmly did
                  he congratulate himself upon this issue to his singular adventure—for not only had
                  he secured a splendid suit of clothes, but he also cherished strong
                  hopes—presumptuous dog that he was!—of being made the happy recipient of Mrs.
                  Smith's kindness; for she had inspired him with the most ardent passion.</p>
               <p>Jack's knowledge of human nature enabled him to perceive that this lady was a
                  woman of strong passions, which is often the case with females of a calm<pb
                     n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8051-00000025"/> and placid exterior. The surface of the
                  ocean is sometimes smooth as glass, out who shall say what is hidden in its
                  unexplored depths? "Still water runs deep," saith a venerable proverb, in which
                  there is a great deal more truth than poetry.</p>
               <p>Our hero saw in Mrs. Smith a woman eminently beautiful, and susceptible of
                  emotions the most tender and voluptuous. Possessed of wealth, moderate indeed, but
                  amply sufficient for all her wants, she lived in unpretending but elegant
                  solitude, and enjoyed an unbroken leisure and a luxurious repose which gave her
                  imagination free scope to wander, even against her own will, amid those flowery
                  paths of pleasure from whose actual delights she was, from the nature of her
                  position, excluded. She was a widow, too, and familiar with the blisses of love;
                  how natural that she should recall to mind the joys of her past experience, and
                  contrast them with the peculiar discomforts of her present solitary and widowed
                  state!</p>
               <p>To such a woman, how dangerous is temptation! Though she be "chaste as snow," ere
                  its white and unpolluted surface is kissed by the wanton sun, let her not too
                  highly estimate the power of her virtue; for, like the snow, that virtue, in an
                  unguarded moment, may melt beneath the burning rays of a lover's ardent eyes.</p>
               <p>Our hero saw the kind of material he had to work upon, and doubted not of his
                  eventual success. One circumstance strongly confirmed his hopes: he saw the looks
                  of intense admiration with which the lady regarded the Apolly Belvidere, and from
                  that moment he had whispered to himself—"She is mine."</p>

               <head type="sub">"VIRGIN MODESTY."</head>
               <p>Having selected the most magnificent suit which the wardrobe of Master Augustus
                  afforded, the young impostor expressed his wish to "try on" the garments
                  immediately, in order to assure himself of their perfect fit.</p>
               <p>Here ensued a very delicate scene and, in order to sustain his part properly, Jack
                  was obliged to bring into requisition all the tact, skill and address which he
                  possessed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith—who, of course, had not the slightest suspicion of the deception which
                  was being practiced upon her—offered her services to assist the pretended young
                  lady in the performance of the duties of the toilet.</p>
               <p>The tone and manner in which the good lady made this offer, indicated that she
                  considered its acceptance as a matter of course—its refusal, as entirely out of
                  the question. For what could be more natural than for one lady to assist another,
                  under such circumstances? Her fair young friend (she thought) was, from motives of
                  policy, about to go through the unusual operation of putting on male clothing; and
                  therefore <emph>her</emph> help was indispeasable.</p>
               <p>Jack had his own reasons for wishing to perform his toilet alone. He did not wish
                  that the lady should be astonished and shocked by any <emph>abrupt</emph>
                  discovery. He desired that the truth should gradually dawn upon her mind, so
                  gently, that when she perfectly comprehended the real facts of the case, she would
                  be prepared to receive the declaration of his passion, without experiencing any
                  sudden or violent emotion to destroy her natural ardent susceptibility.</p>
               <p>Imagine the profound surprise of Mrs. Smith, when the supposed young lady
                  respectfully but firmly declined receiving any assistance whatever!</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, my dear child," said the nandsome widow, in a tone of gentle
                  remonstrance—"how can you, without my aid, put on these awkward male garments, to
                  which you are of course entirely unaccustomed? Come, take off your gown, and let
                  me unlace your stays."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, madam. I cannot suffer you to wait upon me like a servant. Be assured,
                  I can get along very well without your assistance; for, since my childhood, I have
                  been used to dress and undress myself."</p>
               <p>"That may be, my dear, but you have never yet dressed yourself in male clothing,
                  about which there are many peculiarities unknown in the costume of our sex. Nay, I
                  insist upon rendering my services, and shall be offended if you refuse them."</p>
               <p>"But, my dear madam——'</p>
               <p>"But me no buts, for I will <unclear>not listen</unclear>," playfuly interrupted
                  Mrs. Smith—"you decline my aid because you wish to avoid giving me trouble; you
                  will find, however, that I am a very obstinate creature, when I am determined to
                  have my own way."</p>
               <p>So saying, Mrs. Smith advanced and began to busy herself in removing the elegant
                  dress worn by the young impostor.</p>
               <p>Jack, finding himself driven, as it were, into a corner, resolved to make a bold
                  push in order to rid himself of the lady's attentions, while changing his clothes.
                  Casting his eyes modestly upon the floor, he summoned up a blush, and said, with
                  much timidity and embarrassment of manner—</p>
               <p>"You will think me very silly, I am sure; yet I trust, madam, that your refined
                  delicacy of heart will enable you to appreciate my feelings. I may be prudish and
                  ridiculously sensitive; I may carry to an absurd extreme that modesty and reserve
                  which should characterize our sex. Forgive me, if I err; but it is better to err
                  on the right side—is it not, dear madam?"</p>
               <p>"I do not understand <unclear>you," said</unclear> the lady, astonished.</p>
               <p>"Well, madam, I will <unclear>endeavor</unclear> to explain my meaning. <unclear>I
                     know</unclear>, then, that from my earliest childhood I have ever felt an
                  invincible repugnance to the most trifling exposure of my person, even to one of
                  our own sex. I never could endure to dress or undress even in the presence of my
                  mother, who observed this strange peculiarity of mine, and kindly humored it. This
                  feeling has grown with my years, and at the present time I would suffer the
                  greatest inconvenience rather than appear before a second person <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">en dishabille.</foreign> That, madam, is the true reason of my
                  declining your kindly meant offers. Pardon me, but I could not endure the thought
                  of your beholding me in a condition——you understand me, and I need not speak
                  further. Oh, madam, would that I had never entered this house, for you will both
                  hate and despise me for this worse than childish weakness!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith felt seriously offended. Her refined and womanly feelings enabled her
                  to comprehend that excessive delicacy, or rather, bashfulness, which might render
                  a young lady averse to being seen <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en dishabille,</foreign>
                  even by one of her own sex. Yes, she could even share in such a feeling. But
                  surely her newly-found friend might have made an exception with reference to
                     <emph>her,</emph> considering that the affair in question involved the
                  mysteries and unaccustomed difficulties of making a male toilet, which rendered
                  assistance almost absolutely indispensable. Under <emph>ordinary</emph>
                  circumstances, the extreme modesty displayed by the interesting young stranger
                  would have been excusable—perhaps commendable; "but under these
                     <emph>peculiar</emph> circumstances," (thought Mrs. Smith,) "her rejection of
                  my aid is carrying her ideas of propriety to a ridiculous
                     <unclear>length</unclear>."</p>
               <p>Here was another cause of Mrs. Smith's chagrin: it seemed to her that<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000026"/> she had been <unclear>surpassed</unclear> in her
                  notions of strict modesty by her young friend. She felt humiliated and experienced
                  that vague sensation of uneasiness and self reproach which people often feel, when
                  they imagine that they have done something wrong, and yet cannot distinctly recall
                  to mind what that something is.</p>
               <p>Therefore was Mrs. Smith offended.</p>
               <p>Jack instantly perceived that he had lost ground in the lady's favor, but he
                  contented himself with the reflection that he was in a fair way (as he hoped) to
                  gain even more than he had lost.</p>
               <p>"I have displeased you, madam," said he, with an air of contrition.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith was too truthful a woman to deny the fact implied by the words of the
                  young impostor. She merely replied by a faint smile; and remarked, as she turned
                  to leave the chamber—</p>
               <p>"When you have completed your toilet, you can, if you please, join me in the
                  sitting room."</p>
               <p>She closed the door after her, and Jack was left alone.</p>
               <p>"I have hurt her feelings," thought he, as he began rapidly to throw off his
                  female garb—"and I am sorry for it, but it could not be helped. When I return to
                  her, I shall speedily restore her to the most excellent humor, and entertain her
                  in a manner that she little anticipates. Ah! I am a fortunate fellow, to have
                  managed my escape from prison, and gained a magnificent woman for my mistress, all
                  during the same evening! However, she's not mine yet, and I may be 'reckoning
                  without my host.' Now for the male toggery; I am delighted to cast aside these
                  cursed female duds, and resume the proper habilaments of manhood. Ha! these
                  broad-cloth pants fit me to perfection, and so, I am sure, will these elegant
                  French boots. Faith, I am vastly obliged to Master Augustus for the use of his
                  wardrobe; he is a fellow of taste, and I should like to make his acquaintance, but
                  as that is not possible at present. I will express my gratitude for the loan of
                  the clothes, through the medium of attentions to his handsome aunt."</p>
               <p>In less than ten minutes after the conclusion of the foregoing soliloquy, Jack was
                  completely dressed in a most costly and elegant suit of clothes, the cut and
                  fashion of which would have immortalized a Parisian tailor. As he surveyed his
                  really superb countenance and matchless form in the large oval mirror which
                  surmounted the dressing-table, a smile of gratified vanity parted his finely
                  chiselled lips, and he murmured—</p>
               <p>"Ah! what woman could resist me now! Certainly not a buxom, voluptuous, and
                  handsome widow, who has for some time been a stranger to the joys of love! By St
                  Paul! the blood rushes like burning lava through my veins, as I think of that
                  glorious woman! What eyes, beaming with a soft and heavenly light—what a mouth for
                  kisses—what a shape, suggestive of substantial blisses—and then what a full, rich
                  bust, as yet concealed from my enamoured gaze by that high-reaching dress, but
                  these eager eyes shall ere long feast upon its beauties! Yes, these sacriligious
                  hands shall invade that region of snow, and wanton amid its glowing treasures
                  Never did Napoleon look forward to the achievement of a victory, with a mightier
                  joy, than that with which I now anticipate the conquest of the lovely, chaste and
                  languishing widow! Shine out fair sun of hope! But the devil take
                     <unclear>all</unclear> soliloquizing; I go now into the presence of my
                  divinity."</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Jack entered the apartment in which the beautiful widow was awaiting his
                  arrival.</p>
               <p>His elegant appearance—the ease and grace of his manner—elicited from the lady a
                  exclamation of surprise and admiration.</p>
               <p>For the faintest shadow of suspicion that the young impostor was not a female, had
                  never entered her mind, with such consummate skill and address had our hero played
                  his part</p>
               <p>She had expected, that when dressed in male attire, her young friend would present
                  rather an awkward figure, and exhibit; the bashfulness and restraint of manner
                  natural to a young girl who for the opposite sex.</p>
               <p>But she found herself agreeably disappointed, and the pleasure which she
                  experienced effectually dissipated her anger, and restored her to all her natural
                  good humor.</p>
               <p>She arose, and with a radiant smile held out her hand, which Jack pressed warmly
                  to his lips. He then led her to the sofa, and placed himself at her side.</p>
               <p>"What an astonishing change!" exclaimed the beautiful window, as she surveyed her
                  companion with looks of undisguised admiration. "I can scarcely recognize you as
                  the young lady form who, I parted a short time ago. Even your features look more
                  masculine, your form more robust, and your appearance in every respect is that of
                  a young gentleman."</p>
               <p>"I trust dear madam, that the change which I have, thanks to your generosity, been
                  enabled to you? If it is, I shall sincerely regret having abandoned the 'petticoat
                  banner' for the honors of the breeches."</p>
               <p>"Your alteration in costume, my dear produces no alteration in my regard or you.
                  You are still a young lady whose misfortunes demand my sympathy. How mach you now
                  resemble my nephew Augustus! The same graceful form and remarkably well-formed
                  legs! This disguise admirably becomes you, and displays your symmetrical shape to
                  the greatest advantage."</p>
               <p>"Speaking of your nephew Augustus—ah! Dear madam, what a happy fellow he must
                  be!"</p>
               <p>"And why so, pray!"</p>
               <p>"Because he is related to so beautiful a woman, and can pass a considerable
                  portion of his time in her adorable society; because he can have the privilege of
                  loving her, and enjoy the bliss of being beloved by her in return—and although
                  that mutual affection is of the cold and chaste nature proper to the relations
                  which exist between a nephew and his aunt, still it must be inexpressibly
                  delightful when that aunt is so charming, dear madam, as your self."</p>
               <p>"When did you learn such graceful flattery, my dear? It must have been poured into
                  your ears by some eloquent lover. You could not speak with a greater degree of
                  enthusiasm, if you were in reality a young gentleman."</p>
               <p>"And if I <emph>were</emph> a young gentlemen, would you not hate and despise
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"I could neither hate nor despise you under any circumstances. But good heavens!
                  When you spoke just now, your voice seemed to be as greatly altered as your garb.
                  Its tones were almost masculine."</p>
               <p>Jack threw his arm around the lovely widow's buxom waist, pressed her closely to
                  him and said—</p>
               <p>I could almost wish, dear madam, that my sex corresponded with my present garb, so
                  that I might enjoy the luxury of loving you with that passion ate ardor which your
                  beauty is so well calculated to excite in the male breast Then might I possibly
                  inspire you with a reciprocal flame, and taste with you the ineffable blisses of
                  love!"</p>
               <p>The lady's superb bosom swelled with a deep and passionate sigh. Her downcast eyes
                  and glowing cheeks proclaimed the effect produced by the exciting words of her
                  companion.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8051-00000027"/>
               <p>"Oh!" cried the artful impostor, as he drew her still closer to his throbbing
                  breast—"how happy will be the man who shall succeed in winning the priceless jewel
                  of thy love—who shall claim the blessed privilege of holding thee ever in his
                  arms, as I do now—who shall possess the right to kiss thy beauteous lips—thus—and
                  whose nightly pillow shall be this peerless bosom, with all its glorious
                  loveliness revealed to his enraptured gaze!"</p>
               <p>During the utterance of this impassioned burst of amorous eloquence, Jack took
                  good care to "suit the action to the word." The beautiful widow, bewildered, and
                  excited by feelings which she could not exactly define, but which she acknowledged
                  to herself were strangely delightful, abandoned herself without restraint, and
                  with a wildly palpitating heart, to the kisses, caresses and audacious
                  familiarities of her mysterious companion, who now commenced throwing off the
                  false character which he had assumed.</p>
               <p>A light began to dawn upon the lady's mind. Half frightened, half secretly
                  pleased, and yet quite uncertain, she endeavored to extricate herself from Jack's
                  embrace, saying, in agitated tones—</p>
               <p>'Your words, your looks, your actions, alarm me! Who and what are you, thus to
                  excite within me feelings which—nay, I cannot remain longer with you, for it seems
                  as if—something tells me that you have been deceiving me. You are not what you
                  pretend to be; you are——"</p>
               <p>"I am your adorer!" cried Jack, now speaking in his natural tones; and throwing
                  himself at her feet, he almost devoured her fair hands with ardent kisses.</p>
               <p>"Ah, that voice! It is that of a man!" exclaimed the agitated widow—"good heavens!
                  how indiscreet I have been, and how strangely blind, not to have detected this
                  abominable imposture. Whoever you are, sir, I command you to quit this house in
                  stantly. No gentleman would have taken this base advantage of a woman's
                  unprotected situation. Go, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Never, until those sweet lips have pronounced my pardon. Hear me, madam. I have
                  long adored you in secret. Maddened by your beauty, I resorted to his stratagem in
                  order to obtain admission to your presence. I am young, and will devote my future
                  years to the promotion of your happiness. I am rich, and will throw my fortune at
                  your feet. All that I ask in return is the blessed privilege of being permitted to
                  consider myself your most devoted slave'"</p>
               <p>"Who are you, then?" asked the widow, who was beginning to feel a strange interest
                  in this eloquent and mysterious youth.</p>
               <p>"I am, madam—ahem!—I am of noble birth. My father is Lord Ashbarrel, the British
                  Minister, now at Washington! I will inherit the broad English acres and the
                  ancient title of my distinguished and noble sire!"</p>
               <p>"And your intentions—"</p>
               <p>"Are honorable. Yes, charming madam, the sacred rites of the church shall sanctify
                  our love. Thy peerless brow shall be decorated with the glittering insignia of
                  nobility. In the halls of my ancestors, shall you, as the Lady Ashbarrel, receive
                  the homage of a thousand vassals. It shall be so, upon the honor of a British
                  peer!"</p>
               <p>Never did a "walking gentleman" of light comedy recite a passage with more
                  brilliant effect than that displayed by our hero, in the delivery of the foregoing
                  extravagant speech, the audacity of which was fully in accordance with the vast
                  amount of assurance possessed by him. Mrs. Smith was by no means a woman of
                  penetration, and she saw nothing absurd in these lofty pretensions of the dashing
                  and elegant youth, whose fine person and rare accomplishments she so much admired.
                  She was as credulous and unsuspecting as she was beautiful and amiable; and her
                  vanity was flattered by the idea of having a "peer of Great Britain" at her feet,
                  an humble petitioner for her smiles and favors.</p>
               <p>Ah, well! why need we dwell longer upon this scene? The reader has already
                  anticipated Jack's complete triumph. The heart of the beautiful widow, already
                  half rebellious against her better judgement, soon succumbed to the thrilling
                  persuasions of excited passion. How could she resist the fervent pleadings of that
                     <emph>eloquent and nigh-born youth,</emph> whose love for her was so romantic
                  and sincere? Had she been an angel, she might have escaped from the tide of
                  delicious emotions that overwhelmed her soul; but being merely a woman, two words
                  will tell all the rest—<emph>she fell.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>And Jack Harold passed the night in delightful imprisonment within the arms of
                  beauty.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">CARROTTY TOM THE LOCKSMITH.</head>
               <p>It was late when Jack arose upon the following morning; and if ever a fellow
                  enjoyed a capital excuse for havinh neglected that maxim of health which enjoins
                  the necessity of early rising, it is certain that <emph>he</emph> was that fellow,
                  upon that occasion.</p>
               <p>Having resumed the elegant garments of Master Augustus, he announced to the
                  beautiful widow—who was now all smiles, and blushes, and amorous fondness—that
                  certain business of importance, connected with his illustrious father's official
                  position, demanded his immediate attention.</p>
               <p>"I shall return this evening, queen of my soul,' said he, with the air of a
                  theatrical lover—"to renew our transports, and to make arrangements relative to
                  our union."</p>
               <p>"Farewell, <emph>Frederick Adolphus,</emph>" murmured the languishing fair one—for
                  Jack had assumed that aristocratic title—"farewell. The hours will pass on leaden
                  wings until your return. Ah! 'tis agony to part, but our reunion will be
                  proportionably happy."</p>
               <p>The lovers embraced, and separated. Jack issued forth into the street, and the
                  enamoured widow, who had not arisen, threw herself back in her luxurious couch,
                  and abandoned herself to the soft languor produced by the recollection of the joys
                  of the preceding night, while she anticipated future pleasures. Having taken the
                  first step in the path of frailty, this really well-meaning and once excellent
                  woman found it both easy and delightful to continue in the flowery road of guilt,
                  reckless of the horrible abyss of destruction in which that road is generally sure
                  to terminate.</p>
               <p>As we shall perhaps have no further occasion to allude to this lady, in the course
                  of this narrative, we may as well here remark, in dismissing her from the stage,
                  that shortly after her intrigue with our hero, she was so fortunate as to become
                  the wife of a very worthy man, whose affection left her nothing to desire, Her
                  unsatisfactory position as a widow had contributed to her fall from virtue; but,
                  as her marriage with a man in the prime of life immediately placed her in a
                  situation to her the most intensely gratifying, she had nothing to wish for, and
                  was superior to temptation. Her subsequent excellent conduct as a wife and mother
                  amply atoned for her fault. Eight months after her marriage, she presented her
                  overjoyed husband with a son. The infant was of remarkable beauty, and the happy
                  mother was struck with its extraordinary resemblance to a certain young
                     <emph>British nobleman</emph> with whom she had formerly enjoyed a slight
                  acquaintance. However, being a discreet woman, she said nothing.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8051-00000028"/>
               <p>We now return to our hero, whom we find again at liberty, and in the possession of
                  a fashionable suit of clothes and a full purse. The garments were those of Master
                  Augustus; the money was that which he had taken from the dead body of old
                  Delaplaine.</p>
               <p>So far from intending to repeat his visit to the beautiful widow, Jack determined
                  to leave the city without any delay, for he well knew that every effort would be
                  made to re-capture him.</p>
               <p>It was not without many fears that he now passed along the streets, dreading every
                  moment to encounter some police officer or individual who might recognize him and
                  cause his arrest.</p>
               <p>Not daring to approach a railroad or steamboat depot for the purpose of leaving
                  the city, he resolved to get into the open country and trust to good fortune for
                  the rest.</p>
               <p>In pursuance of this design, he walked rapidly towards one of the great bridges
                  which span the Schuylkill river, intending to cross and seek some safe means of
                  conveyance to Pittsburg.</p>
               <p>For he recollected that "Gallus Kate" and her paramour. Armitage, had fled to that
                  city, and the deadly thirst for vengeance still retained possession of his
                  soul.</p>
               <p>He was hurrying forward, when he encountered a man whose appearance caused him to
                  pause suddenly, while his face assumed the crimson hue of desperate rage.</p>
               <p>The man was dressed as a mechanic, and was a hideously ugly fellow, with flaming
                  red hair. On seeing Jack, he also paused, and turned pale as a corpse, while his
                  knees smote together with fear.</p>
               <p>This man was <hi rend="i"/>Carrotty Tom the locksmith, who had betrayed Jack and
                  his partner in the affair of the bank robbery, in which the unfortunate <hi
                     rend="i"/>Ribber was killed.</p>
               <p>It will be remembered that this same fellow was the ringleader of the ruffians
                  who, on the preceding night, had attacked our hero, supposing him to be a female,
                  he being disguised in female attire.</p>
               <p>Jack surveyed the trembling coward for a few moments without speaking, and then
                  said to him, in tones of concentrated hatred, rage and scorn—</p>
               <p>"So, scoundrel, we have met again!"</p>
               <p>Carrotty Tom made no reply, but, turning on his heel, he would have fled, had not
                  Jack caught hold of him with an iron grasp.</p>
               <p>"Thou craven cur," cried our hero, as he shook the wretch until his teeth
                  chattered in his head—"we part not thus easily. There is a heavy account to settle
                  between us. 'Twas owing to your damned treachery that my friend met his
                  death."</p>
               <p>"Let me go, or I'll cry out for help!" faltered the affrightened locksmith, who,
                  by the way, was a powerfully built man, and might easily have over come his
                  youthful assailant, had it not been for his own despicable cowardice.</p>
               <p>The street in which this scene took place being rather retired, there was no great
                  probability of much attention being attracted by Carrotty Tom's cries for
                  assistance. Jack perceived this, and determined to gratify his thirst for
                  vengeance, at least in part, by inflicting upon the treacherous locksmith a most
                  unmerciful thrashing.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, he forthwith went to work upon the ugly profile of his victim with
                  such industry and vigor, that a dozen or so of Carrotty Tom's teeth were extracted
                  with a facility seldom achieved by a dentist; and, within the space of two
                  minutes, the locksmith was as thoroughly whipped and terribly bruised as any
                  gentleman that ever figured in the classical records of the fistic science.</p>
               <p>"That's for your treachery!" cried Jack, as he planted a tremendous blow upon that
                  useful organ wherein snuff-consumers usually deposit their titillating ting
                  compounds of Scotch and Maccaboy.</p>
               <p>"And that's for your attempted outrage, last night, upon an <emph>unprotected
                     female,</emph>" added Jack, with a laugh, as he made the unhappy locksmith see
                  stars by a severe rap in the region of his optics.</p>
               <p>This last blow was a "finisher" to Carrotty Tom, who lay "straightened out" upon
                  the side-walk. The punishment which he had received was exceedingly severe, but he
                  certainly deserved it, for he was a most unmitigated scoundrel.</p>
               <p>Two or three persons had witnessed the foregoing scene, and were not a little
                  surprised to see a great burly ruffian like Carrotty Tom so effectually beaten by
                  a slender and handsome youth, dressed with all the elegance of a Parisian
                  dandy.</p>
               <p>Having completed this work of vengeance to his own entire satisfaction, Jack made
                  a graceful bow to the spectators of the scene, as if to thank them for their
                  non-interference, and then resumed his walk with as much unconcern as if nothing
                  had happened.</p>
               <p>The discomfitted locksmith picked himself up, as the saying is, and gazed at our
                  hero's retreating form with looks of frantic rage, as he muttered a whole volley
                  of fierce curses. It maddened him to think that he, a notorious bully and
                  "blower"—a rowdy, and member of the desperate band of
                  "<emph>Killers</emph>"—should be thus publicly beaten by a person so much his
                  inferior in point of size and strength.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Carrotty," cried out one of the spectators—"you had more than your match
                     <emph>that</emph> time!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said another—"that young gentleman, notwithstanding his delicate and
                  fashionable appearance, has spoiled your beauty for some time to some, old boy.
                  Wonder who he is? He seems to be a perfect master of pugilistic science."</p>
               <p>The words, "<emph>wonder who he is?</emph>" immediately suggested to the dull mind
                  of the locksmith a plan of avenging his injuries; and he was astonished that he
                  had not thought of this plan sooner.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you who he is," he cried, with sudden animation—"he is a robber—a
                  burglar, and has broke out of prison. It is Jack Harold!"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed the others, incredulously—"the person of whom you speak is
                  in jail, awaiting his trial for bank robbery and attempted murder."</p>
               <p>"I tell you that it <emph>is</emph> Jack Harold! I <emph>blowed</emph> upon him in
                  the bank robbery business, and that is why he <emph>pitched into</emph> me, just
                  now. Follow and arrest him—quick, before he escapes—and you will get a reward. If
                  he is not Jack, you may drown me in the Schuylkill!"</p>
               <p>The locksmith spoke with an enregy that carried conviction with it; and the men
                  started off in pursuit of the young Outlaw, who was by this time a considerable
                  distance off.</p>
               <p>A couple of police officers, who chanced to be in the neighborhood, on being
                  briefly informed of the circumstances of the case, also joined in the chase.
                  Carrotty Tom limpingly brought up the rear.</p>
               <p>Jack, having walked very rapidly, had nearly crossed the bridge ere he became
                  aware that he was pursued.—Then he bitterly cursed his own impetuosity and lack of
                  caution, in suffering himself to become involved in a broil with the miserable
                  locksmith, whom he should have avoided out of a regard for his own safety. It was
                  now, however too late to remedy the evil.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE LEAP FOR LIBERTY.</head>
               <p>Jack's pursuers were close upon him. On either side of them were the railings of
                  the bridge and beneath was<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8051-00000029"/> the dark
                  rolling river. Before him, beyond the bridge, extended a dusty turnpike road,
                  bordered with numerous farm-houses. No place was visible likely to afford him
                  concealment; not even a clump of trees or a cluster of bushes.</p>
               <p>Should he dash forward and rush along the turnpike, trusting to his speed and
                  agility as a runner, for his escape? No; for those in pursuit would fill the air
                  with their shouts, and men would come forth from the farmhouses to stop him, and
                  ferocious dogs would be set upon him. What, then, <emph>should</emph> he do?
                  Tamely surrender himself into the hands of the Philistines?</p>
               <p>"Never!" thought he—"I will stop and parley with these fellows, and try to bribe
                  them If that fails, I have a plan; 'tis a dangerous and desperate one, but I'll
                  try it!"</p>
               <p>He paused, faced his pursuers, and awaited their approach. Thinking that the
                  fugitive might possibly be armed and prepared to make a stout and bloody
                  resistence, these gentlemen stopped at a safe distance, in order to
                  deliberate.</p>
               <p>"That's Jack Harold, I'll take my oath!" remarked one of the police officers.</p>
               <p>"Ay," said the other—"so it is, but how shall we capture him? He is a desperate
                  young chap, and is most likely well armed."</p>
               <p>Our hero, guessing their fears, and wishing to have them approach him near enough
                  to converse, now extended his open hands to show that he had no weapons, and
                  endeavored by signs to assure them that he meditated no act of hostility.</p>
               <p>Thus relieved of their fears, the pursuing party approached to within a few paces
                  of the spot where Jack stood. Carroty Tom skulked behind the others, and, with his
                  characteristic modesty, seemed to be desirous of keeping out of sight.</p>
               <p>"Well, gentlemen," said our hero, courteously—"what is your business with me?
                  Please to be as brief as possible, for I am anxious to be getting forward on my
                  journey, having business of importance to transact."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, my dear sir, to disturb any of your arrangements," said the most
                  gentlemanly of the police officers, with a smile—"but you must condescend to
                  accompany us back into the city. Nay, so anxious are we for the pleasure of your
                  company, that we will positively take do denial. <emph>our</emph> business is
                  quite as important as yours."</p>
               <p>"But suppose that I peremptorily decline conferring upon you the honor of my
                  society?"</p>
               <p>"I scarcely believe you to be capable of so ungentlemanly a refusal. To be obliged
                  to resort to <emph>compulsory measures</emph> would cause us sincere regret."</p>
               <p>"Come, sir, it is time to put an end to this masquerading," cried our hero, who
                  was now beginning to grow impatient—"please to state, in as few words as possible,
                  why you have followed me, and what you expect of me!"</p>
               <p>"We have followed in order to arrest you, for you are one Jack Harold, an escaped
                  prisoner, charged with heavy crimes. We expect you to return to jail with us
                  peaceably, in order to avoid the necessity of our treating you with harshness,
                  which, I repeat, would cause us regret, for there is something in your manners and
                  appearance which interests us."</p>
               <p>Jack thanked the gentlemanly officer for the compliment, and then, spying out
                  Carrotty Tom, he thus addressed that worthy individual:—</p>
               <p>"Scoundrel, remember my words. I am again indebted to you for being placed in a
                  situation of peril, and I now <emph>owe you one.</emph> Half an hour ago I settled
                  up with you for past services. You have now incurred another obligation, and be
                  assured that the debt shall be punctually paid. The punishment that I gave you
                  to-day, is nothing to that which I shall inflict upon you, when we meet again.
                  Gentlemen, since this sneaking wretch is in your company, I cannot so far forget
                  my own dignity as to join you. You will therefore excuse me for wishing you, in
                  this abrupt and unceremonious manner, a very good morning!"</p>
               <p>The next moment, Jack had leaped over the railings of the bridge, and plunged into
                  the deep and rapid current of the Schuylkill river.</p>
               <p>Petrified with astonishment, the spectators of this scene could scarcely believe
                  the evidence of their own senses.</p>
               <p>Our hero was an excellent swimmer; but, encumbered with a full suit of
                  tight-fitting clothes, he found himself greatly embarrassed. Yet, with a stout
                  heart, he struck boldly out, hoping that the current would soon carry him beyond
                  the reach of his pursuers.</p>
               <p>Recovering from the amazement produced by this daring and desperate act, the
                  officers and their allies looked hastily about them, in the hope of discovering
                  some means of overtaking the fugitive. They soon espied, drawn up on the nearest
                  shore, a small boat, containing a couple of oars.</p>
               <p>"The very thing!" cried one of the officers; and, followed by his companions, he
                  ran to the end of the bridge and descended to the beach. The united strength of
                  the party soon placed the little vessel afloat. The two officers leaped in, and,
                  seizing the oars, rowed away most vigorously, leaving the others to regret that
                  the small size of the boat prevented them from sharing in the glory of the chase.
                  They hastened to return to the city, in order to spread the particulars of this
                  remarkable affair.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CONDEMNATION.</head>
               <p>The current had carried our hero to a considerable distance, but the boat
                  containing the two officers gained upon him rapidly. Finding himself thus
                  unexpectedly pursued, he redoubled his efforts, but all in vain. The minions of
                  the law were soon upon him; and then, completely exhausted and over-come with
                  profound despair, he suffered himself to sink in the watery depths, preferring to
                  drown than to be taken.</p>
               <p>But he was not thus destined to terminate his career—for there is a proverb which
                  saith—"He that is born to be hanged can never be drowned."—When, almost senseless,
                  he arose to the surface, one of the officers seized him in his powerful grasp, and
                  dragged him into the boat. Hand-cuffs were immediately placed upon his wrists as a
                  measure of precaution, and then the party hastened to effect a landing, in order
                  to convey the prisoner to safe quarters.</p>
               <p>Poor Jack! when he recovered his perfect consciousness, he found himself again an
                  inmate of the same dismal dungeon from which he had made his escape on the
                  preceding evening.</p>
               <p>Here he remained two days. In addition to the other horrors of his situation, he
                  was obliged to endure the brutality and abuse of the malignant turnkey whom he had
                  locked in the cell, and who was not slow to avail himself of this most excellent
                  opportunity, of visiting upon the unfortunate and helpless prisoner the full
                  measure of his wrath.</p>
               <p>Jack endured this oppression with philosophical fortitude; his mind was too deeply
                  engrossed with the awful peril of his position, to admit of his bestowing any
                  attention upon the petty annoyances of the miserable jail flunkey—otherwise, the
                  latter gentleman<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8051-00000030"/> man might have received
                  some token of the prisoner's regard, more striking than agreeable; for our hero
                  was full of spirit and courage, and was besides no contemptible opponent in a
                  physical encounter.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the third day after his re-capture, Jack's cell-door was thrown
                  open, and he was requested to come forth. He obeyed, and found himself in the
                  presence of two officers attached to the criminal court which was then in session.
                  These gentlemen, having briefly informed the prisoner that they had come to convey
                  him to the Court House for trial, politely escorted him to the trial, politely
                  escorted him to the door of the jail, where a carriage was in waiting.</p>
               <p>Having entered this vehicle, the party were soon driven to the massive stone
                  edifice in which the solemn tribunal was sitting.</p>
               <p>The court room was crowded to excess, and many ladies were present, for Jack's
                  reputation had spread far and wide, and his exploits in crime, and escapes from
                  prison, had rendered him the hero of the day.</p>
               <p>On being placed in the prisoner's dock, which was considerably elevated above the
                  audience, Jack gazed about him with a bold and undaunted expression.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he started, and betrayed symptoms of extreme surprise—for, seated among
                  the elegantly dressed ladies, herself the most beautiful one among them, was
                     <emph>Mrs. Smith,</emph> his voluptuous companion of the night on which he had
                  escaped from jail.</p>
               <p>In attendance upon this lady, was a handsome and fashionably dressed youth, whom
                  Jack naturally supposed to be no less a personage than Master Augustus, her
                  nephew.</p>
               <p>As the dress of our hero had been greatly changed, since his re-capture, the
                  beautiful widow did not recognize in the prisoner at the bar, the "young British
                  nobleman" whose grace and comeliness had seduced her from the path of virtue; and,
                  not being at all desirous of such a recognition, Jack kept his head averted in
                  such a manner as to prevent the lady from viewing his countenance.</p>
               <p>The Judge upon the bench was noted for his extraordinary severity, and the
                  prisoner saw that he need hope for no mercy in that quarter.</p>
               <p>The usual formalities having been gone through with, the trial of the prisoner for
                  attempting to murder Capt. Douglass was commenced.</p>
               <p>The affair of the bank robbery had been laid aside, conviction being certain on
                  the other charge, the punishment of which, it was thought, would be adequate to
                  cover both offences.</p>
               <p>We do not intend to weary the reader by giving a detail of the trial, which was
                  short and summary. Jack declined the proffered services of counsel, for he saw the
                  perfect absurdity of protracting the <unclear>affair</unclear>, which he knew must
                  inevitably result in his condemnation. The frowning, dark-browed Judge, the savage
                  looking jury, and the particularly malignant looking prosecuting attorney, who was
                  renowned for his legal acquirements and bitter eloquence—all these combined to
                  assure the prisoner that there was no hope.</p>
               <p>"GUILTY," said the jury. Jack listened to the verdict with perfect indifference,
                  for he had expected it as a matter of course.</p>
               <p>Then arose the black looking Judge, with terrible eye, stern lip, and contracted
                  brow. He quoted largely from the Revised Statutes; he talked learnedly on matters
                  pertaining to law; he expatiated upon the divine majesty of justice, and enlarged
                  upon the necessity of protecting society by punishing every description of crime
                  with the most unrelenting severity. As for mercy, he remarked, that ridiculous
                  quality had no business in a court of justice. He concluded a very impressive
                  speech by sentencing the culprit at the bar to imprisonment in the Eastern
                  Penitentiary, <emph>during the term of his natural life.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The court then adjourned; the audience dispersed, the jury repaired to a
                  neighboring tavern to <emph>lunch,</emph> and the Judge went home to indulge in a
                  comfortable nap until dinner time. All were satisfied—excepting our hero.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">MARY THE MAID OF THE INN.</head>
               <p>The Eastern Penitentiary stands upon the outskirts of the city of Philadelphia,
                  and is conducted on a plan peculiar to the state of Pennsylvania.—The system here
                  is rigid, strict, and hopeless solitary confinement; and although its intentions
                  may be kind, humane, and meant for reformation, there can be no question that its
                  effects are cruel and wrong.</p>
               <p>To this terrible institution was Jack Harold sentenced for life.</p>
               <p>Immediately after his sentence, the unfortunate youth was hand-cuffed, and
                  conducted to the carriage which was to convey him to the place destined for his
                  hopeless imprisonment. He was to go in charge of the same two officers who had
                  brought him from the jail. These men were both rough and hard-hearted fellows, who
                  could contemplate any amount of human misery without feeling a single sentiment of
                  pity.</p>
               <p>The party having seated themselves in the carriage, were driven at a rapid rate
                  towards the prison.</p>
               <p>As if Nature had determined to mock the misery of the <emph>doomed for
                     life,</emph> the day was one of uncommon loveliness. Brightly shone the
                  glorious sun from the deep blue of a cloudless sky; and the shining river danced
                  merrily beneath its golden beams.</p>
               <p>As the carriage slowly ascended a hill of considerable steepness and length, a
                  prospect of singular and luxurious beauty opened to poor Jack's view. In the
                  distance lay the busy and populous city, that from the height seemed still and
                  lifeless as a region of enchantment over which the mid-day sun hung like a
                  guardian spirit. Beyond, in sweeping diversity, stretched wood and dale, and
                  fields presenting a yellow surface to the eye, ever and anon relieved by some
                  bright patch of green; while, here and there, spire and village studded the
                  landscape, or some lowly cot lay, backed by the rising ground or the silent woods,
                  white and solitary, and sending up its faint tribute of smoke in graceful wreaths
                  to the altars of heaven.</p>
               <p>The Schuylkill river was more pregnant of life than its banks; barge and boat were
                  gliding gayly down the wave, and the glad oars of the frequent and slender vessels
                  consecrated to pleasure were seen dimpling the water made by distance smoother
                  than glass.</p>
               <p>As Jack eagerly but sorrowfully gazed at these different objects from the carriage
                  window—objects which were to him so painfully suggestive of happiness and liberty
                  that <emph>he</emph> could not enjoy—one of the officers said to him, with a
                  coarse laugh—</p>
               <p>"That's right, young feller—take a good look at the world in gineral, for it will
                  be a d—d long while afore you have another chance to see anything except the
                  inside of the stone box in which you are to pass the remainder of your life—ha,
                  ha, ha!"</p>
               <p>This brutal laugh was echoed by his companion, who doubtless saw something very
                  witty in the remark. As for Jack, his thoughts were too busy with the horrors of
                  his position, to admit of his attending to the unfeeling mirth of the
                  officers.</p>
               <p>At a short distance from the prison was situated a small road-inn, whose swinging
                  sign proclaimed "Good Entertainment for Man and Beast."—<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000031"/> Here at the request of the officers, the driver
                  stopped—for the worthy minions of the law were dry, and they knew by pleasant
                  experience that the liquor of mine host was of excellent quality.</p>
               <p>One of the officers leaped out of the carriage and entered the tavern, while his
                  companion remained to guard the prisoner.</p>
               <p>The landlord—a second Falstaff, with a nose like a beet—received the officer with
                  all the cordiality due to a good customer.</p>
               <p>"Glass of brandy for me," cried the officer—"and carry another to my comrade in
                  the carriage. Be quick, for it is time that we were at the prison."</p>
               <p>While the landlord was bustling about to comply with these orders, his daughter, a
                  young and very pretty girl, entered the tap-room.</p>
               <p>The officer emptied his tumbler, and the landlord went out, decanter in hand, to
                  supply the wants of the gentleman who remained in the carriage. When he returned,
                  his countenance wore an expression of curiosity, and he asked—</p>
               <p>"Pray, sir, who is that good-looking young fellow whom you have in the carriage
                  hand-cuffed? I suppose he's a convict for the prison?"</p>
               <p>"You're about right there, my man," replied the officer, with a patronising
                  air—"by the way, landlord, I'm a devilish good-natured chap as you know very well,
                  so I'll make a great man of you to-day—for nothing makes a man so great as being
                  let into a great secret. Did you ever hear tell of Jack Harold the great bank
                  robber, who broke out of jail and nearly murdered Captain Douglass, the head
                  keeper?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly—who has not?"</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see him?"</p>
               <p>"No! I can't say I ever did."</p>
               <p>"You lie, landlord—you saw him just now."</p>
               <p>"What?" cried the landlord, in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Fact, 'pon honor. That's him in the carriage, hand-cuffed; we're carrying him to
                  the prison, where he is sentenced for life."</p>
               <p>The landlord's pretty daughter hurried out in order to obtain a view of the famous
                  young criminal, whose wonderful exploits had already rendered him the hero of her
                  untutored and romantic imagination. Her heart palpitated with mingled love and
                  pity, when she saw Jack's youth and beauty, and noticed his extreme dejection.
                  Seeing that he also looked pale and weakly, she ran back into the tavern, poured
                  out a bumper of excellent port wine, and then returning to the carriage, raised
                  the tumbler to the prisoner's parched and feverish lips. Jack murmured his thanks,
                  and drank eagerly, while the officer looked on with a grim smile. Even
                     <emph>he</emph> had not the heart to interfere and deprive the poor prisoner of
                  the last refreshment of the kind which he should ever probably enjoy.</p>
               <p>"I pity you very much," whispered the young girl, applying her rosy lips to the
                  prisoner's ear.</p>
               <p>"Ah! such sympathy is sweet," answered Jack, speaking in the same tone—"you make
                  me feel almost happy, in spite of my awful situation."</p>
               <p>"Have you no hope?"</p>
               <p>"None; the Governor will never pardon me, and I fear that it will be impossible to
                  escape."</p>
               <p>"Do not despair; nothing is impossible to a person like you. Come closer to me, so
                  that the officer may not overhear us—so; now listen to me. Make every effort to
                  break out of the prison, and if you succeed—as I prophesy that you will—come to
                  me, and I will assist you. That is my chamber, with the white curtains to the
                  windows. There is a ladder behind the stable—you understand me? Always reckon upon
                  Mary Wilson as your friend"</p>
               <p>"Dear Mary—for your kindness emboldens me to call you so—how shall I thank
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"By taking good care of yourself, dear Jack, and never giving way to despair,"
                  replied the girl, as a deep blush mantled upon her pretty face.—The most
                  passionate love for the handsome young convict had already sprung up in her
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"What the devil is all that whispering about?" now demanded the officer, who had
                  not heard a single word of the foregoing conversation—"are you courting?"</p>
               <p>"Suppose that we are," said the young girl, pertly—"what business is that of
                  yours, Mr. Sauce-box?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, none at all, my pretty dear; but you've found a precious lover at last. Why
                  don't you kiss him? You won't have another chance for some time—ha, ha, ha!"</p>
               <p>The girl, wishing to provoke the officer—who was, by the way, a rejected suitor of
                  hers—and being also urged by an irresistible impulse, threw her arms around Jack's
                  neck, and pressed her warm, moist lips to his.—A momentary sensation of delight
                  thrilled through the frame of our hero, whose blood had been warmed by the
                  generous wine; and the heightened color of the girl iudicated the pleasure which
                  she derived from the affectionate salutation.</p>
               <p>"Well done!" cried the officer, endeavoring to conceal his jealously and
                  chagrin—"now, my dear, won't you also give <emph>me</emph> a kiss?"</p>
               <p>"Kiss <emph>your</emph> ugly face—never! I hate the very sight of you," replied
                  the mischievous Mary, who delighted to torment this man, whom she really
                  detested.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sneak—for the officer rejoiced in that melifluous cognomen—colored with rage.
                  At that moment, the other officer, who had been indulging in repeated potations,
                  issued from the tavern, and resumed his seat in the carriage.</p>
               <p>Old Wilson, the landlord, made his appearance, and angrily demanded of his
                  daughter what she was doing, idling there, when she should be busy with her
                  household concerns?</p>
               <p>"She has been making love to this young rascal here, and kissing him!" maliciously
                  bawled Sneak from the carriage window.</p>
               <p>"Has she, the wench! I'll learn her to kiss thieves!" exclaimed Wilson; and with
                  these words, the old brute rushed upon his daughter, and struck her.</p>
               <p>Jack's blood boiled, but, of course, he could do nothing. The two officers
                  laughed, and one of them remarked that old Wilson knew how to keep his daughter in
                  trim.</p>
               <p>"He often beats her," said the other—"she's a pretty girl, but rather wild."</p>
               <p>The carriage now started; and, as he was being whirled rapidly away Jack saw poor
                  Mary standing at one of the windows of the inn. She fixed upon him a loving and
                  sorrowful look, and <q>
                     <l>"Adieu! she cried, and waved her lily hand."</l>
                  </q>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE SOLITARY PRISON.</head>
               <p>In less than ten minutes, the carriage drew up before the prison; and Jack
                  shuddered as he gazed up at the dark and frowning walls, within whose awful
                  precincts he was doomed to be immured, a hopeless captive.</p>
               <p>"Here we are," said one of the officers, as he leaped from the carriage; his
                  comrade followed, and assisted Jack to alight. Then the two men, taking the
                  prisoner between them, approached the gloomy pile.</p>
               <p>Between the body of the prison and the outer wall there was a spacious<pb
                     n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8051-00000032"/> garden. Entering it by a wicket in the
                  massive gate, the party pursued the path before them to its other termination, and
                  walked into a large room occupied as an office.</p>
               <p>Here they were received by the governor of the institution, and several of his
                  deputies. The two officers, having formally delivered the prisoner, and various
                  documents relating to him, took their departure, after removing the hand-cuffs
                  from Jacks wrist's.</p>
               <p>The governor now made a short address to the prisoner, explaining the rules of the
                  institution, describing the punishments which would inevitably result from any
                  violation of those rules, advising him to abandon every hope of pardon or release,
                  and exhorting him to peruse his Bible diligently, to pray constantly, and to
                  endeavour, by a sincere repentance, to atone for the many crimes of his past life.
                  The governor, at the conclusion of a most "refreshing discourse"—he was an
                  ex-clergyman, by the way—assured the prisoner that, if he behaved himself with
                  perfect propriety, he should be treated with every indulgence consistent with his
                  situation.</p>
               <p>This being over, Jack was conducted, by one of the deputies, into a smaller
                  apartment. Here he was requested to strip himself entirely naked. This order
                  having been obeyed, the deputy noted down in a book a most exact description of
                  the prisoner's person, not omitting the <emph>brand of crime</emph> which had been
                  placed upon his breast, years before, when he became a member of the "Unholy
                  Alliance."</p>
               <p>Having bathed, and had his hair cut snort off, Jack was furnished with a suit of
                  coarse grey cloth, the convict uniform of the institution.</p>
               <p>When he had duly arrayed himself in this "fancy costume," he followed the deputy
                  back into the office, and there underwent a ceremony which now for the first time
                  elicited from him a groan of anguish</p>
               <p>This ceremony, simple in itself, but very significant in its import, consisted of
                  the drawing of a black hood over his head and face.</p>
               <p>In this dark shroud, an emblem of the curtain which was dropped between him and
                  the living world, he was led to the cell which he was sentenced to occupy during
                  the remainder of his life.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>A description of this celebrated prison may prove interesting to the reader.</p>
               <p>There is a large chamber, from which seven long passages radiate.—On either side
                  of each of these passages is a long row of low cell-doors, with a certain number
                  over every one. Above, is a gallery of cells like those below, except that they
                  have no narrow yard attached, (as those on the ground tier have,) and are somewhat
                  smaller. The possession of two of these is supposed to compensate for the absence
                  of so much air and exercise as can be had in the dull strip attached to each of
                  the others in an hour's time every day; and therefore every prisoner in this upper
                  story has two cells adjoining and communicating with each other.</p>
               <p>Standing at the central point, and looking down these dreary passages, the dull
                  repose and quiet that prevail, are awful. Occasionally, there is a drowsy sound
                  from some lone weaver's shuttle, or shoemaker's last, but it is stifled by the
                  thick walls and heavy dungeon door, which only serve to make the general stillness
                  more profound.</p>
               <p>A man who becomes an inmate of one of these cells, or sepulchres, never hears of
                  wife or children, home or friends; the life or death of any single creature. He
                  sees the prisons officers, but with that exception he never looks upon a human
                  countenance, or hears a human voice. He is a man buried alive, to be dug out in
                  the slow round of years; and in the meantime he is dead to everything but
                  torturing anxieties and horrible despair.</p>
               <p>His name, and crime, and term of suffering are unknown, even to the officer who
                  delivers him his daily food. There is a number over his cell door, and in a book
                  of which the governor of the prison has one copy, and the moral instructor
                  another: this is the index to his history. Beyond these pages the prison has no
                  record of his existence; and though he live to be in the same cell ten weary
                  years, he has no means of knowing, down to the very last hour, in what part of the
                  building he is situated; what kind of men there are about him; whether in the long
                  winter nights there are living people near, or he is in some lonely corner of the
                  great jail, with walls, and passages, and iron doors between him and the nearest
                  sharer in his solitary horrors.</p>
               <p>Each cell has two doors, the outer one of stout oak, the other of grated iron,
                  wherein there is a trap through which the prisoner's food is handed.—He has a
                  Bible, and a slate, and pencil, and, under certain restrictions, has sometimes
                  other books, provided for the purpose, and pen and ink and paper. His razor,
                  plate, and can, and basin, hang upon the wall, or shine upon the little shelf.
                  Fresh water is laid on in every cell, and he can draw it at his pleasure. During
                  the day, his bed-stead turns up against the wall, and leaves more space for him to
                  work in. His loom, or bench, or wheel is there, and there he labors, sleeps and
                  wakes, and counts the seasons as they change, and grows old.</p>
               <p>Imagine that ten years must pass over the head of the prisoner, in this awful
                  place. Ten years! What a period of seemingly endless duration to him, immured
                  within the gloomy walls of his narrow cell, daring not to breathe the pure
                  atmosphere of heaven, or look upon the unclouded sky! His heart is never gladdened
                  by the bright smiles of nature; he hears no sound but the whistling of the wind
                  without, or the dull echoes of the busy loom reverberating along the vaulted
                  passages of his prison-house, counting each day, as it wearies on, by the light
                  which steals through the grating of his windows; at morn, praying for night, and
                  with its approach, sighing for the return of day.</p>

               <head type="sub">IMPRISONMENT.</head>
               <p>If a sentence of ten years to this place be so terrible, imagine what must have
                  been the feelings of Jack Harold, who, in the very flower of his youth, was
                  condemned to <emph>imprisonment for life!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>On being conducted to his cell—one of the upper ones, to which there was no garden
                  attached—Jack's black hood was taken off, and the scene of his captivity was
                  disclosed to him in all its dismal monotony.</p>
               <p>The doors of his <emph>tomb</emph> were closed upon him and locked, and he was
                  left alone in his misery.</p>
               <p>At first, he was stunned. His confinement seemed to be a hideous vision and his
                  old life a reality. He threw himself upon his bed, and lay there abandoned to
                  despair. By degrees, the insupportable solitude and barrenness of the place
                  aroused him from this stupor, and when the trap in his grated door was opened, he
                  humbly begged and prayed for work, saying—"Give me some work to do, or I shall go
                  raving mad!"</p>
               <p>Work was furnished him, and by fits and starts he applied himself to labor; but
                  every now and then there came upon him a burning sense of the years that must be
                  wasted in that stone coffin, and an agony so piercing in the recollection of those
                  who were hidden from his view and knowledge, that he started from his seat, and
                  striding up<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8051-00000033"/> and down the narrow room with
                  both hands clasped upon his uplifted head, he fancied that he heard spirits
                  tempting him to beat his brains out against the wall.</p>
               <p>Again he fell upon his bed, and lay there, moaning. Suddenly he started up,
                  wondering whether any other unfortunate was near him—whether there was another
                  cell like that on either side of him—and he listened keenly.</p>
               <p>There was no sound, but he knew that other prisoners might be near him, for all
                  that. He remembered to have heard once, when he little thought of being confined
                  there himself, that the cells were so constructed that the prisoners could not
                  hear each other, though the officers could hear them. Where was the nearest
                  man—upon the right or on the left? Or was there one in both directions? Where was
                  he sitting then—with his face to the light? or was he walking to and fro? How was
                  he dressed? Had he been there long? Was he much worn away?—Was he very white and
                  spectre-like? Did <emph>he</emph> think of his neighbour, too?—And, above all, how
                  long was he sentenced to remain an inmate of his tomb—<emph>for life?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Scarcely venturing to breathe, and listening while he thought, Jack conjured up a
                  figure with its back towards him, and imagined it moving about in the next cell.
                  He had no idea of the face, but he was certain of the dark form of a stooping man.
                  In the cell upon the other side he put another figure, whose face was hidden from
                  him also. Day after day, and often when he awoke in the middle of the night, he
                  thought of those two men until he was almost distracted. He never
                     <unclear>changed</unclear> them. There they were always as he first imagined
                  them—an old man on the right, a younger man upon the left—whose hidden features
                  tortured him to death, and had a mystery that made him tremble.</p>
               <p>The weary days passed on with solemn pace, like mourners at a funeral; and slowly
                  did poor Jack begin to feel that the white walls of his cell had something
                  dreadful in them—that their color was horrible—that their smooth surface chilled
                  his blood—that there was one hateful corner which tormented him. Every morning
                  when he awoke, he hid his head beneath the coverlet, and shuddered to see the
                  ghastly ceiling looking down upon him. The blessed light of day itself peeped in,
                  an ugly phantom face, through the unchangeable crevice which was his prison
                  window.</p>
               <p>By slow but sure degrees, the terrors of that hateful corner increased until they
                  haunted him at all times—they invaded his rest, made his dreams hideous, and his
                  nights dreadful. At first, he took a strange dislike to it, feeling as though it
                  gave birth in his brain to something of corresponding shape, which ought not to be
                  there, and racked his head with pains. Then he began to fear it, then to dream of
                  it, and of men whispering its name and pointing to it. Then he could not bear to
                  look at it, nor yet to turn his back upon it. It seemed to be every night the
                  lurking-place of a ghost—a shadow—a silent something, horrible to see; but whether
                  bird, or beast, or muffled human shape, he could not tell.</p>
               <p>When night came on, there stood the phantom in the corner. If he had the courage
                  to stand in its place, and drive it out—he had once, being desperate—it brooded
                  upon his bed. In the twilight, and always at the same hour, a voice called to him
                  by name. As the darkness thickened, the Phantom began to live; and there it stood,
                  a hideous figure, watching him till daybreak.</p>
               <p>Again, by slow degress, these horrible fancies departed from him one by one;
                  returning sometimes unexpectedly, but at longer intervals, and in less alarming
                  shapes. Occasionally, the<unclear>old</unclear> agony came back; a very little
                  thing revived it—even a familiar sound, or the scent or flowers in the air; but it
                  did not last long, for the world without had become as a vision, and his solitary
                  life, the sad reality.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">JACK AND THE GOVERNOR.</head>
               <p>Summer faded into autumn; and when the winter had passed, and spring had returned
                  with all its beauty, Jack Harold was still an inmate of that horrible cell.</p>
               <p>One day, the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania, accompanied by several members
                  of the Legislature and other officials, paid a visit to the prison, and passed
                  from cell to cell, for the purpose of examining the condition of the institution
                  and its numerous inmates.</p>
               <p>"His Excellency,"—(what an abominable title to bestow upon a republican
                  officer!)—was a tall and singularly ugly personage, of limited intellect but
                  boundless conceit; he had been elevated to office by one of those accidents which
                  so frequently convert political cyphers into figures of the first magnitude, while
                  men of true worth and ability are neglected.</p>
               <p>When the party of distinguished visiters came to Jack's cell, the doors were
                  thrown open, and the gentlemen crowded around in order to obtain a view of the
                  youthful prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jack, who was thoughtfully pacing to and fro in his cell, paused in his walk, and
                  surveyed the party with an air at once haughty and stern. He disliked to be made
                  an object of curiosity, and he believed that these persons had come for no other
                  purpose than to stare at him.</p>
               <p>Although our hero had now been nearly a year in confinement, his health had not
                  been materially affected. The excellence of his condition was the result of the
                  abundant exerercise which he took daily, and the sufficiency of good and wholesome
                  food which he received. He had also, in a great masure, recovered his ordinary
                  cheerfulness of mind, and this, more than anything else, had doubtless contributed
                  to the preservation of his health, despite the pernicious influences of a close
                  and solitary imprisonment.</p>
               <p>The visiters were suprised to see, in that tomb-like place, a youth of such rare
                  personal beauty and dignified aspect; for the crushing discipline of the
                  institution almost invariably, in a short time, converted the most robust men into
                  puny and spiritless wretches—mere animated corpses.</p>
               <p>Jack was, indeed, looking remarkably well. He had taken extreme care of his
                  person, and preserved the most scrupulous neatness in everything about him. Cut
                  off from every kind of dissipation and irregularity, his entire system was in
                  admirable order, and he needed but the air of liberty to complete the perfection
                  of his bodily condition.</p>
               <p>When first incarcerated, he had given way to despair; but the natural buoyancy of
                  youth had finally triumphed over his feelings of depression, and hope whispered to
                  him, that, not-withstanding his <emph>sentence for life,</emph> he should again be
                  free. The consequence of this change in his spirits soon became manifest, in the
                  improvement and preservation of his health.</p>
               <p>But we must not so far forget the respect due to an exalted functionary, as to
                  keep the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania standing at the door of a
                  prisoner's cell, waiting for our attentions. So we will return to "His
                  Excellency," and his retinue.</p>
               <p>The Governor, not liking the stern and haughty air with which the prisoner
                  regarded him, turned to the prison<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8051-00000034"/> on
                  officer who was in attendance, and abruptly demanded—</p>
               <p>"Who is this convict?"</p>
               <p>"Please your Excellency," was the reply of the obsequious officer—"he is sentenced
                  for life, for attempting to murder Captain Douglass, of the city jail."</p>
               <p>"Oh—ah; I remember; a desperate young villain," muttered the Governor.</p>
               <p>When Jack heard this gentleman addressed as His Excellency, he knew at once that
                  his visiter was no less a personage than the Chief Magistrate of the Commonwealth,
                  who, in that State, alone possesses the pardoning power, independent of the
                  necessity of seeking the concurrence of a Council, as in Massachusetts, where the
                  Executive cannot act singly, in such cases.</p>
               <p>Here, then, was an opportunity of very rare occurrence—a chance to apply for the
                  clemency in person, and not through the indirect medium of a petition.</p>
               <p>Jack instantly determined to avail himself of this opportunity.</p>
               <p>"Who knows," thought he—"perhaps, if I ask him, in an humble and proper manner,
                  the old fellow may take a notion to pardon me on the spot. Such things
                     <emph>have</emph> happened; at all events, it is worth trying, and the effort
                  cannot make my situation worse. So here goes."</p>
               <p>Abandoning his air of pride, Jack assumed an attitude of entreaty, and, in a
                  supplicating voice, he thus addressed the astonished Governor:—</p>
               <p>"May it please your Excellency, you see before you an unfortunate and most
                  wretched youth, the victim of cruel circumstances, which have combined to place me
                  here, a prisoner for life, with all my hopes blasted and my feelings crushed.
                  Driven by stern necessity into crime—my aged parents, and famishing brothers and
                  sisters yelling for bread, and myself destitute of the means of procuring even a
                  penny roll—in an evil hour the tempter thumphed, and I became involved in an act
                  of dishonesty. Yes, your Majesty—I mean, your Excellency—my reputation, which
                  until that fatal moment had been spotless and brilliant as the sword of a knight,
                  became stained with guilt. Thrown into prison, I made my escape and on passing
                  through the house of Captain Douglass the head jailor, that gentleman, from an
                  exaggerated notion of duty, attempted to take my life. Self-preservation, nature's
                  first law, prompted me to defend myself to the full extent of my ability. In the
                  struggle, the Captain was unfortunately wounded, but is now well. For this
                  offence, may it please your Royal Highness—I mean your Excellency—I have been
                  sentenced for life. My punishment is too severe, your Honor—I mean your
                  Excellency.—If I live to serve out my term of imprisonment, and stay here all my
                  life, I shall be ruined—overwhelmed—crushed—in other words, completely
                     <emph>floored.</emph> Therefore, great and illustrious man! whose fame is as
                  enduring as the eternal hills, and lustrous as the stars—therefore, my good sir—I
                  mean, your Excellency—damn my forgetfulness!—design to release me from these
                  bonds, and I will at every convenient opportunity send up a prayer for your
                  health, happiness, personal and political prosperity, and long continuance in the
                  office which you now adorn. 'To err, is human—to forgive, divine.'"</p>
               <p>The Governor, too obtuse to detect the irony contained in this singular appeal,
                  and too egotistical not to notice and feel pleased at the gross flattery which
                  pervaded it, gazed around upon the company with a bewildered air, and seemed to
                  ask their opinion as to the propriety of pardoning the eccentric youth, whose
                  mischief-loving propensities could not be restrained, even while supplicating the
                  highest officer in the State for his release from perpetual imprisonment.</p>
               <p>A half-suppressed titter, on the part of the company of visiters, who fully
                  appreciated and enjoyed Jack's remarkable speech, delivered as it was with an
                  effect half serious and half comic—led the Governor to suspect that the prisoner
                  had been <emph>making game</emph> of him. Now this was intolerable to a man of his
                  Excellency's irritability and importance; therefore, swelling with wrath, he said
                  to our hero, harshly—</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, sir—what do you mean? How dare you speak to me—to
                     <emph>me?</emph> Do you know who I am—eh! Do you know that I have the power to
                  let you go free, or hang you up, just as I see fit? (This was a stretch of
                  imagination on the Governor's part; he was rather addicted to such little
                  deviations from truth.) I won't pardon you, sir; I won't. You're not a fit subject
                  for mercy. You must stay here all your life, according to your sentence. I shall
                  leave orders with the warden to treat you with the utmost severity, for I believe
                  you to be a desperate and hardened young reprobate!—Not a word more, sir, not a
                  word; I won't listen to you. Officer, close the cell door!"</p>
               <p>"Stay a moment," cried Jack, whose indignation was aroused by the harsh tone of
                  the Governor, whom he longed to mortify and humiliate in the presence of the
                  company—"before you go, gentlemen, suffer me to express my deep regret, at having
                  so far lost sight of my own self-respect, as to condescend to ask a favor of
                     <emph>His Excellency,</emph> who seems to be too much of a tyrant to
                  comprehend, much less exercise the divine quality of mercy, and too much of a
                  jackass to understand when he is made a butt for ridicule."</p>
               <p>Then, addressing the astounded Governor, who stood pale and trembling with rage,
                  Jack continued—</p>
               <p>"I shall get out of this prison without your official aid, my high old rooster!
                  Put that in your gubernatorial <unclear>pipe and smoke it</unclear> until your
                  leather brains become singed! We shall meet again; and when we <emph>do</emph>
                  meet I shall have just five words to say to you, and those words will be short
                  ones. The interview will take place, not between a Governor and a convict, within
                  the walls of a prison; but between man and man, beneath the blue vault of heaven,
                  and upon the ground of equality. Gentlemen, pardon me for having detained you so
                  long; but, really, I see visiters so very seldom, that when honored with a call, I
                  am naturally disposed to make the most of it. I cannot at present return your
                  civility, but may be enabled to do so at some future time, notwithstanding the
                  objections of His Excellency. Good day, gentlemen."</p>
               <p>Amid a general murmur of astonishment, produced by the audacity of his language
                  and manners, Jack made a low bow, and turned away. The door was closed upon him,
                  and the visiters departed, marvelling greatly that an inmate of that
                  body-destroying and soul-crushing institution should, after a year's confinement,
                  retain a sufficient amount of spirit to openly ridicule and threaten the highest
                  dignitary in the State.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE HIDDEN TREASURE.</head>
               <p>Having lost all hope of being released from prison by Executive pardon, our hero
                  now set himself seriously to work to devise some plan for effecting his escape. He
                  well knew that this task would be attended with the utmost difficulty. Indeed, it
                  was considered absolutely impossible for a prisoner to escape from that
                  institution. Yet Jack determined to make the attempt, and either recover his
                  liberty or perish.</p>
               <p>In consequence of the Governor's <unclear>recommendation, our</unclear> hero was
                     now<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8051-00000035"/> treated with great severity by the
                  officers of the prison. His food was of inferior quality, and he was required to
                  perform a daily amount of labor almost double that demanded of him previous to the
                  unfortunate visit of His Excellency. But this harshness only served to strengthen
                  his determination to escape from that abode of solitude and hopeless misery.</p>
               <p>His superior jugenuity was not long in suggesting what seemed to be a capital
                  plan; and he proceeded to put it into immediate operation.</p>
               <p>A young clergyman—the Rev. Mr. Spoons—officiated as chaplain of the prison. He was
                  a young man of fine personal appearance, and graceful manners. Although a great
                  dandy and a most unmitigated hypocrite, he made the most extravagant professions
                  of piety, and was generally regarded as an earthly saint. These pretensions to
                  holiness he managed to sustain by an externally correct deportment, and a constant
                  solemnity of speech and manner. Few per ons suspected that, beneath that grave and
                  pious exterior, there lurked almost every bad passion that can disgrace humanity,
                  or degrade the sacred office of a minister of the gospel.</p>
               <p>Jack, with his natural penetration, soon perceived the true character of this man,
                  whom he now resolved to make an involuntary instrument of his escape from
                  imprisonment,</p>
               <p>As the convicts never issued from their cells, for any purpose whatever—not even
                  to attend divine service—the <emph>reverend</emph> gentleman, in order to
                  administer spiritual consolation to these poor, benighted souls, every Sabbath day
                  went from cell to cell, passing a short time with each of the inmates, and
                  exhorting them to turn from the paths of sin, and embrace the ways of
                  righteousness and peace.</p>
               <p>Thus far, the weekly visits of the young clergyman to the cell of our hero had not
                  produced any very satisfactory results; for Jack detested hypocrisy is any shape,
                  and he did not hesitate to express, his doubts of his religious friend's
                  sincerity, particularly as the latter gentleman had upon one occasion manifested
                  some slight symptoms of inebriation, and had also accidentally dropped from his
                  pocket a card, upon which Jack found inscribed the address of the most notorious
                  and fashionable brothel-keeper in the city of Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Spoons afterwards accounted for his possession of the card by saying
                  that he had been summoned to that "sink of iniquity" merely in order to pray with
                  a dying fellow creature of the female gender; but Jack thrust his tongue into his
                  cheek upon hearing this lame explanation, and pronounced the single word
                     "<emph>gammon!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Attracted, in spite of himself, by the intelligence, independence and boldness of
                  our hero, the Rev. gentleman, under pretence of laboring for his soul's salvation,
                  frequently visited him, and upon such occasions, he would remain locked up in the
                  cell with the prisoner until he desired to be released, when, by knocking
                  vigorously upon the door, he could easily summon the jailor who would let the holy
                  man out.</p>
               <p>The conversations which took place between the prisoner and the parson, during
                  these interviews, were by no means confined to religious subjects. On the
                  contrary, they embraced almost every variety of topic, and were conducted with the
                  utmost familiarity, and without the slightest regard to the relative situations of
                  the parties. By this means, Jack was kept "posted up" in all the news of the day;
                  and, under the circumstances, the society of the young clergyman was to him a
                  source of the most agreeable entertainment.</p>
               <p>This was the state of affairs when the prisoner formed his plan of escape, which
                  plan will be thoroughly developed in due course.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the Governor's visit to the prison, the Rev. Mr. Spoons noticed that
                  Jack grew extremely melancholy. All his cheerfulness had left him, and he seemed
                  to be laboring under some hidden and overwhelming sorrow.</p>
               <p>Attributing this apparent grief to the refusal of the Governor to pardon him, the
                  parson endeavored to console the prisoner by holding out hopes of pardon when some
                  other person should be elected to the chair of State.</p>
               <p>"You mistake the cause of my sorrow," said Jack, heaving a profound sigh—"I no
                  longer desire the pardon of man, which cannot benefit my soul My many
                  transgressions require a <emph>Heavenly</emph> forgiveness, and 'tis that which
                  makes me wretched."</p>
               <p>"Can it be possible, my friend, that your heart has experienced a change?" cried
                  the astonished clergyman.</p>
               <p>"Thanks to your pious discourse, I begin to see the error of my ways," replied
                  Jack, solemnly.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Spoons, on hearing these words, so flattering to his vanity as a man
                  of most immaculate piety, assumed a more than usually sanctified look, and began
                  to think that he must in reality be a perfect saint, since his discourse had been
                  the means of converting a sinner.</p>
               <p>It is no uncommon thing to see hypocrites deceiving themselves as well as other
                  people, and placing implicit confidence in their own purity and excellence. Bulwer
                  somewhere remarks, that 'the easiest person to deceive is one's own self.'</p>
               <p>"The Lord be praised!" cried the parson—"that I have been made the humble and
                  unworthy instrument of conducting a lost sheep to the good shepherd's fold!"</p>
               <p>"Amen!" responded Jack, as he privately placed his thumb to his nose, and waved
                  his extended fingers in the air—a piece of quiet pantomime that was unobserved by
                  the parson.</p>
               <p>At their next interview, our here thus addressed his reverend friend:—</p>
               <p>"I will not deny that my unsuccessful application to the Governor has caused me
                  much disappointment; for I had a far nobler and more important object in view than
                  the mere recovery of my liberty. Yes, I designed to do an act of justice, which
                  should in part atone for my past crimes. Had I been restored to liberty, such is
                  the mighty change which religion has wrought in my soul, that I should instantly
                  have made reparation to those whom I have robbed, by distributing among them the
                  enormous wealth which I have accumulated during my career of crime. But, alas!
                  that satisfaction is denied me; here I must remain, while that illgotten treasure
                  lies mouldering and useless!"</p>
               <p>The clergyman, a man of expensive habits and but limited income, pricked up his
                  ears when he heard the prisoner thus allude to a concealed treasure, and said—</p>
               <p>"So, then, you have accumulated riches?"</p>
               <p>"Unfortunately, yes. My many successful bank robberies have placed me in
                  possession of an immense amount of money in gold, to say nothing of a large
                  quantity of valuable jewelry, obtained by extensive burglaries in different cities
                  of the Union."</p>
               <p>"Where is this treasure deposited?"</p>
               <p>"I am bound by a solemn oath never to reveal the spot where the property is
                  buried. A partner in crime, with whom I took this oath, is now dead; but yet I
                  regard the oath as sacred, and shall keep it I could only go in person, to recover
                  the treasure."</p>
               <p>"May I ask in what section of the country this treasure is buried?"</p>
               <p>"I have no objection to answer that question. The gold and jewelry, contained in a
                  large box shaped like a coffin, are deeply buried in the earth in a certain
                  church-yard near Philadelphia, and not five miles from this prison. We<pb
                     n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8051-00000036"/> selected a church-yard as our place of
                  deposit on account of its security. No one would think of searching for gold amid
                  the quiet inmates of the grave!"</p>
               <p>"Very true," responded the parson, who seemed to be struck with a sudden idea. Now
                  listen to me with attention. It is a great pity that you should be prevented from
                  acting in accordance with the commendable dictates of your reformed heart. Could
                  you be enabled to return that treasure to its lawful owners, what a burden of
                  guilt would be removed from your conscience!"</p>
               <p>"Yet, alas! it is impossible!" groaned jack.</p>
               <p>"It is <emph>not</emph> impossible," said the parson, emphatically—"you may dig up
                  the treasure, and through me, or some other trustworthy person, distribute it
                  among those persons to whom it properly belongs. And when you have performed this
                  act of justice, allow me to assure you that thousands of persons will sign a
                  petition for your pardon, which the Governor will not then refuse to grant."</p>
               <p>"But," said Jack—"how am I, a prisoner, to have an opportunity of digging up the
                  gold?"</p>
               <p>"It is simple enough. I will this very day speak to Mr. Fox, the warden of the
                  prison; and I have not the slightest doubt that he will consent to your being
                  conveyed—under sufficient escort and properly secured, of course—to any place
                  which you shall designate; any churchyard, for instance, wherein you may desire to
                  dig, in order to find the bones of some relative or friend.—You understand—ha, ha,
                  ha!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I understand perfectly; but that will be violating my oath."</p>
               <p>"Such an oath, involving an unlawful secret, is not binding; besides, you do not
                  reveal, <emph>in words,</emph> where the money is hidden, which, I presume, is the
                  only prohibition involved in the oath."</p>
               <p>Apparently convinced by these flimsy arguments, Jack said—</p>
               <p>"Well, so great is my anxiety to rid my conscience of this weight of stolen
                  treasure, that I will agree to the arrangement which you have proposed."</p>
               <p>"That is well. Mr. Fox and my self will probably be a sufficient guard to
                  accompany you. I will go instantly and consult the warden upon this subject."</p>
               <p>With these words the clergyman gave the signal and was let out of the cell, saying
                  to himself—</p>
               <p>"It will be remarkably strange if I fail to enrich myself abundantly, in this
                  affair!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE WARDEN AND THE PARSON.</head>
               <p>That same evening, Jack was honored with a visit from Mr. Fox the warden, who came
                  to the cell accompanied by the reverend chaplain, Mr. Spoons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fox, without any circumlocution, proceeded at once to business.—He was a
                  gentleman of very decided manners, and pompous speech. He wore a wig of modern
                  cut, carefully curled and powdered, which gave somewhat of a modish, and therefore
                  unseemly grace, to a solemn eye; a mouth drawn down at the corners; a nose that
                  had something in it exceedly consequential; eyebrows, sage and shaggy; ears large
                  and fiery; and a chin that would have done honor to a Mandarin. Nature had
                  impressed upon his mind a prodigious love of the grandiloquent; he disdained the
                  exact language of the vulgar, and built unto himself a lofty fabric of words, in
                  which his sense managed very frequently to lose itself.</p>
               <p>"Convict," said Mr. Fox, addressing Jack with appropriate dignity—"this worthy
                  minister of the gospel has received ceived from you a verbal communication, in
                  which you have declared your ability to proceed to, and distinctly designate, a
                  spot, peculiarly located, in which are secreted certain unlawfully procured
                  valuables, abstracted from various establishments, which—moreover—and
                  whereas——"</p>
               <p>"It is all understood," impatiently interrupted the chaplain—"you, prisoner, are
                  to conduct us to the place where the gold is buried, this very evening, as, for
                  obvious reasons, it would not be so well to attend to it in broad day-light. We
                  shall go in a chaise, and carry with us all the necessary tools. We had better
                  start at once."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Mr. Fox, as he produced from his pockets a pair of hand-cuffs—"
                  with a convict who is sentenced for life, we must employ every needful precaution,
                  in order to prevent the remotest possibility of the escape of the aforesaid
                  convict, and to the end that we may not be made the dupes of any artifice which
                  the said convict may ingeniously concoct, or otherwise—that is to
                  say—moreover——"</p>
               <p>The chaplain here gave a growl of impatience, for his fingers were itching to
                  clutch the golden treasures contained in Jack's imaginary "coffin-shaped box."</p>
               <p>The handcuffs having been properly adjusted upon our hero's wrists, the party
                  stepped out of the cell, traversed the gloomy corridor, passed through the office,
                  crossed the garden, and, emerging from the great gate, entered a chaise which was
                  in waiting, and which contained a pick-axe and a couple of spades.</p>
               <p>The night was beautiful, and a brilliant moon rode majestically through the
                  star-spangled sky.</p>
               <p>The prisoner's emotions were deep and powerful, on finding himself once more
                  beyond the limits of those accursed prison walls, and breathing the pure, free air
                  of heaven.</p>
               <p>"By heavens!" he mentally exclaimed—"sooner than return to captivity, with this
                  brace of soft fools, whose avarice renders them blind, I will die a thousand
                  deaths. Smile upon me, sweet Fortune! thou fickle goddess, who hast treated me so
                  churlishly of late; and this very night shall I stand within the chamber of Mary
                  Wilson, the inn-keeper's pretty daughter!"</p>
               <p>"In what direction lays the churchyard to which we are going?" demanded the Rev.
                  Mr. Spoors, as he took the reins.</p>
               <p>"We follow the main road to the city for a considerable distance," replied Jack,
                  without hesitation—"I will show you where to turn off."</p>
               <p>The clergyman nodded assent; and then, starting the spirited horse into a rapid
                  pace, the gloomy prison walls were soon lost to view.</p>
               <p>When the party drew near to the road-side inn of old Wilson, the heart of our hero
                  beat with many conflicting emotions of joy, and hope, and doubt and fear. Judge,
                  then, of his feelings when Mr. Fox announced his intention of stopping at the inn
                  for a few minutes, in order to obtain a draught of mine host's excellent
                  home-brewed ale.</p>
               <p>No proposition could have been more welcome to the Rev. Mr. Spoons, than this;
                  and, on arriving at the inn, the pious gentleman leaped from the vehicle with an
                  alacrity far surpassing that displayed by Mr. Fox, who was rather infirm in
                  consequence of a severe attack of the rheumatism.</p>
               <p>Jack observed the latter gentleman's extreme stiffness, and was greatly rejoiced
                  thereat. Then, hearing Mr. Spoons call loudly for a bumper of brandy, our hero's
                  hopes of success mounted almost to certainty.</p>
               <p>"All goes well," thought he—"with one of my guards a cripple, and the other half
                  drunk, what is to prevent my escape?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Fox, not daring of course to leave the prisoner alone in the chaise<pb
                     n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8051-00000037"/> commanded him in a tone of authority to
                  alight. Jack obeyed, and was conducted into the tap-room and seated in one corner,
                  which, being remote from either door or window, was deemed a safe place for
                  him.</p>
               <p>The warden sipped his ale while the parson drank freely of brandy and water, which
                  he seemed to enjoy with the utmost relish. Old Wilson, the landlord, waited upon
                  both gentlemen with all the respect due to their importance; for he knew them, and
                  they were excellent customers of his—particularly the parson.</p>
               <p>No one took any notice of Jack, who, seated in his corner, like the celebrated
                  "Johnny Horner" of pleasant memory, seemed to be buried in profound thought.</p>
               <p>His mind, however, was racked with anxiety to see the pretty Mary Wilson; he
                  longed that she should become acquainted with the state of affairs, in order that
                  she might be prepared to receive him in her chamber, and assist him in his flight,
                  as had been agreed between them nearly a year before, when he was being conveyed
                  to the prison.</p>
               <p>To his great joy, the Rev. Mr. Spoons, warmed with the liquor he had drank,
                  suddenly said to the obsequious landlord—</p>
               <p>"Friend Wilson, where is your handsome daughter? Your house loses more than half
                  its attractions, when she is absent."</p>
               <p>The landlord chuckled, rubbed his hands with delight, and replied—</p>
               <p>"Your notice of my daughter does me honor. In truth, the wench is passing comely,
                  but very obstinate. If I could only persuade her to marry—but she has got some
                  strange notions in her head, and won't listen to the idea of choosing a husband.
                  She's in love with some worthless rascal, I'll be sworn. But you shall see her,
                  gentlemen, immediately."</p>
               <p>He left the room, but almost instantly returned, followed by his daughter.</p>
               <p>The young girl, on seeing our hero, recognized him at once. Her surprise at this
                  unexpected meeting was so great, that she with difficulty repressed a scream; but
                  our hero made her a rapid but significant sign, and she remained silent.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CHURCH-YARD.</head>
               <p>Mary's appearance was charming. Her plump cheeks glowed with the
                     <unclear>rich</unclear> hue of perfect health, and her gloss hair, in most
                  picturesque disorder, fell over her neck and shoulders of snow. Her rustic beauty,
                  and the hope of tasting the sweetness of those balmy lips, in the thrilling
                  privacy of her own chamber, increased our hero's determination to escape from his
                  guards.</p>
               <p>With impertinent familiarity, the now half-intoxicated clergyman chucked the young
                  girl under the chin, and then suddenly bending forward, snatched a kiss from her
                  lips.</p>
               <p>Mary was about to resent this insult with a proper display of indignation, when a
                  sudden thought seemed to strike her, and she merely blushed and smiled.</p>
               <p>For she was anxious to keep on good terms with the clergyman, in order to learn
                  from him the particular circumstances under which Jack had been taken from the
                  prison.</p>
               <p>She was not left long in the dark in this respect, for the potent liquor had
                  loosened Mr. Spoons' tongue, and, not regarding the winks and nudges of Mr. Fox,
                  he informed the landlord that the prisoner was going to point out the spot where a
                  valuable treasure was buried.</p>
               <p>Then, with the natural quickness of a woman's wit, Mary Wilson very nearly
                  comprehended our hero's <emph>plan.</emph> Giving him a glance of intelligence and
                  encouragement, she approached the clergyman with a coaxing air, and requested
                  permission to give the poor prisoner a glass of wine.</p>
               <p>"For you know dear Mr. Spoons," said she, as her soft hand coquettishly toyed with
                  that of the amorous gentleman—"that this unfortunate prisoner will require some
                  refreshment to enable him to go through the toil of digging up the treasure."</p>
               <p>Who could have resisted this appeal, which was uttered in the most musical tones
                  in the world? Mr. Spoons certainly could not; and he gave the desired
                  permission.</p>
               <p>Mary filled a tumbler half full of excellent brandy, and presented it to our hero,
                  who quickly imbibed the exhilerating fluid, and then, as he returned the glass,
                  stealthily pressed the fair hand which had given it to him.</p>
               <p>The young girl responded to the pressure with a glance of love, and passion, and
                  triumphant anticipation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fox now arose, and declared that it was time to be moving.</p>
               <p>"I hope you may be successful," said Mary, glancing meaningly at the prisoner.</p>
               <p>"There can be no doubt of it," replied Jack, with strong emphasis.</p>
               <p>The limping warden and the staggering clergyman, each took an arm of our hero; and
                  the three having placed themselves in the chaise, away sped the horse at his
                  utmost speed. The roadside inn was soon left far behind.</p>
               <p>The copious dose of brandy which Jack had taken warmed his blood and raised his
                  spirits to the highest degree of buoyancy. His long abstience from both wine and
                  woman," well qualified him to enjoy both, to their fullest extent.</p>
               <p>The party had driven probably about three miles, when the prisoner espied a narrow
                  cross-road which he knew led to a little village in which was a church-yard.</p>
               <p>"We turn off here" said Jack—"and have but a short distance to go now."</p>
               <p>Both the warden and the clergyman grunted in token of their satisfaction; and both
                  in imagination, were already clutching the gold.</p>
               <p>Having turned off into the crossroad, as directed, the party shortly arrived
                  opposite the low stone wall which enclosed the village church-yard.</p>
               <p>"This is the place," said Jack—"you had better fasten the horse in the deep shadow
                  of these trees. We can easily climb over the wall."</p>
               <p>The horse having been secured as suggested Messrs. Spoons and Fox took the tools
                  from the chaise, placed them on the inside of the wall, and then, taking hold of
                  Jack's arms, assisted him to climb over—a task which was attended with
                  considerable difficulty, on account of the hand-cuffs which confined our hero's
                  arms.</p>
               <p>At length the whole party stood within the precincts of that hallowed spot,
                  devoted to the quiet slumbers of the dead.</p>
               <p>A solemn silence prevailed, save when the soft breeze rustled amid the foliage of
                  the weeping willows, that bent over the graves like guardian spirits. Here and
                  there a tomb-stone arose in the moon-beams like a ghost; and troops of gliding
                  shadows seemed to gather in obscure corners, for the purpose of repelling the
                  invaders of their mysterious abode.</p>
               <p>The limping warden and the half-intoxicated clergyman could not forbear
                  shuddering, as they looked around upon this solemn scene. They felt as if they
                  were doing something unlawful and sacriligious, in thus accompanying a convict, at
                  night, to a church-yard, for the purpose of searching among the graves for stolen
                  treasures. In the same proportion as their fears gained the ascendency over them
                  did the courage and confidence of our hero increase; and, had he not been
                  hand-cuffed, he would without ceremony<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8051-00000038"/>
                  have leaped over the wall, and trusted to his own agility for his escape from two
                  such inefficient guards.</p>
               <p>"I like not this adventure; let us go back," said Mr. Fox, as he rubbed his
                  rheumatic shin, which he had brought into violent contact with a tomb-stone.</p>
               <p>"No, damn it!" cried the clergyman, forgetting, in his intoxication and
                  excitement, his pretensions to holiness—"we have gone too far to retreat. Besides,
                  I know a delicious little widow who can only be bought with gold and jewelry, and
                  this treasure is the very thing. Ha, ha! we parsons are the fellows to gull the
                  natives! But honor bright, you know—mum's the word. Prisoner, conduct us to the
                  place of deposit."</p>
               <p>"This way, gentlemen," said Jack; and, followed by Messrs Spoons and Fox, (who
                  carried the tools,) he led the way to a corner of the church yard which was in
                  deep shadow, and paused before a mound of earth having the ordinary appearance of
                  a grave without a tomb-stone.</p>
               <p>"Here," said the prisoner, with a sanctified air—"buried six feet below the
                  surface of the ground, and contained in a coffin, are those immense treasures
                  which I have accumulated during my career of crime, and which, my heart having
                  become touched with repentance, I am most anxious to have restored to those
                  persons from whom the said treasures were unjustly taken. Let this act of
                  reparation atone for my past transgressions! Praised be the Lord! Dig away!"</p>
               <p>Off came the parson's coat in a trice; and seizing a spade, he attacked the mound
                  of earth with a vigor that soon made the perspiration pour from his face,
                  unaccustomed as he was to employment so laborious. However, nerved by the near
                  prospect of obtaining wealth, and stimulated by the hope of securing possession of
                  the "delicious little widow" to whom he had alluded, the reverend gentlemen
                  persevered manfully, and ere long he had dug to the depth of several feet.</p>
               <p>When he had become thoroughly fatigued, he leaped from the hole, and Mr. Fox, with
                  many a groan of anguish, scrambled in to take his place.</p>
               <p>The soil had now got to be so very hard, that it was necessary to loosen it with
                  the pick. Jack could hardly refrain from laughing, when he beheld the infirm Mr.
                  Fox, engaged in the unusual gymnastic exercise of brandishing an enormous
                  pick-axe, and pausing between each stroke to rub his afflicated shins and mutter
                  deep curses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fox soon became exhausted, and was obliged to desist. With a sorrow ful sigh,
                  Mr. Spoons was preparing to resume his place in the hole, when Jack remarked—</p>
               <p>"It is a pity, gentlemen, that you should thus fatigue yourselves. Here am I,
                  young and strong, and greatly in need of exercise. Let me take a turn at the
                  spade, and I'll engage that it will not be long ere the golden treasure is
                  revealed to your sight."</p>
               <p>"But you are hand-cuffed, and cannot work," said Mr. Fox, who was panting for
                  breath.</p>
               <p>"Surely," rejoined Jack—"you are not afraid to set my arms free for a short time,
                  in order that I may assist you in this laborious task. Are there not two of you,
                  to prevent my escape, if I were inclined to make the attempt—which, heaven knows,
                  I am not; for I repeat that I am anxious to make atonement to society for my
                  crimes."</p>
               <p>The warden hesitated, and said—</p>
               <p>"The sentence against you is a very heavy one. I hardly know if it would be
                  safe—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, very well," interrupted Jack, with assumed indifference—"act your own
                  pleasure, sir; it is nothing to me. I only wanted to assist you."</p>
               <p>The parson, being rather averse to manual labor of any kind, was strongly disposed
                  to favor the prisoner's proposition. He had, moreover the most implicit confidence
                  in his own sagacity. Therefore he remarked to the more cautious warden—</p>
               <p>"This work is very toilsome, and we really need help. There can be no danger in
                  taking off the prisoner's irons for a short time. I myself will be responsible for
                  his safety."</p>
               <p>Mr. Fox hesitated no longer. Taking a key from his pocket, Jack was soon relieved
                  from his hand-cuffs; and seizing a spade, he leaped into the hole, and began to
                  throw out the dirt most manfully, while his two guards looked on with the highest
                  degree of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Our hero worked away until the hole was very nearly six feet deep; and then,
                  complaining of fatigue, he asked and obtained permission to come out. Accordingly,
                  he scrambled up, though not without difficulty; and the parson prepared to take
                  his place.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE COFFIN AND ITS CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>"A little more digging will bring you to the treasure," remarked our hero, as the
                  clergyman carefully descended into the pit.</p>
               <p>"I will put on your hand-cuffs," said the cautious warden, as he produced those
                  ornaments of the wrists, and advanced to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Just at that moment—so critical to Jack—the parson, who had thrown out two or
                  three spade's-full of earth, cried out, in a tone of triumph—</p>
               <p>"Hurrah! I have come to the box of treasure!"</p>
               <p>On hearing this gratifying intelligence, Mr. Fox, forgetful of his intention of
                  ironing the prisoner, leaned over the deep and narrow cavity, in order to obtain a
                  view of the casket of treasure.</p>
               <p>Jack placed himself at the warden's side.</p>
               <p>"The box is large, and shaped exactly like a coffin!" cried the elated
                  parson—"there is even a silver plate upon it—placed there, no doubt, in order to
                  avert suspicion, should the box be discovered. From appearances, no one would
                  suspect that this was anything but an ordinary coffin, containing a corpse.
                  There's something in it more valuable, however, as we shall soon see. It will be
                  very difficult, I am afraid, to raise the box from this hole, for gold is very
                  heavy."</p>
               <p>"Can you not open it, and pass up the treasures in small quantities at a time?
                  'Twill be the easiest way," said the warden, who was trembling with eagerness to
                  behold the glittering spoils.</p>
               <p>The parson assented to this proposal. Having contrived to introduce the sharp
                  point of the pick-axe between the coffin and the lid, he gave a vigorous wrench; a
                  large portion of the lid flew off with a crashing noise.</p>
               <p>Just then a dark cloud stole over the surface of the moon, and obscured her
                  brightness.</p>
               <p>Mentally cursing the sudden darkness which prevailed, the parson stooped down and
                  thrust his hand into the crevice which he had made in the box, in order to clutch
                  a portion of the treasure.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he done so, when he uttered a loud cry of astonishment and terror.</p>
               <p>For his hand, instead of grasping a quantity of golden coins or precious jewels,
                  came in contact with the cold and clammy face of a corpse.</p>
               <p>"Oh, God! assist me out of this dreadful place!" cried the affrightened parson, as
                  he made ineffectual efforts to climb out of the grave.</p>
               <p>He imagined that the disturbed corpse, arrayed in its frightful shroud, was
                  arising from its coffin, in order to twine its dead arms around him.</p>
               <p>The cloud passed from the surface of<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8051-00000039"/> the
                  moon, which now shone forth with all its former brilliancy.</p>
               <p>Then, for the first time, the warden, as he gazed down into the grave with mingled
                  curiosity and fear, beheld the dreadful spectacle.</p>
               <p>The parson, having failed in his attempt to regain a position upon <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">terra firma,</foreign> was crouched down in one corner of the
                  grave, shaking with horror.</p>
               <p>And oh, fearful sight! painfully visible in the bright moon-beams, was the ghastly
                  face of the corpse, upon which corruption had begun to set its disgusting
                  seal.</p>
               <p>The warden, with a sickening sensation, turned for a moment from the awful scene.
                  Then, recovering his presence of mind, he regarded our hero with a furious look,
                  and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Scoundrel! you have deceived us! What is the meaning of all this?"</p>
               <p>"Go down and see," replied Jack, as he gave the warden a sudden and violent push
                  forward.</p>
               <p>Taken completely by surprise, Mr. Fox plunged headlong into the grave, and falling
                  heavily upon the parson, that gentleman was rendered for the time insensible, more
                  through fear than in consequence of any actual injury received by him.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. Fox, his lameness prevented the possibility of his getting out of the
                  grave without assistance. However, he began to call loudly for help; and to stifle
                  his cries, Jack seized the spade which had not been in use, and with it cast a
                  quantity of earth upon the head of the unfortunate warden, who was soon too busily
                  engaged in clearing the dirt from his eyes, mouth and nostrils, to admit of a
                  continuation of his calls for help.</p>
               <p>"My business is now completed in this place; I must be off," thought our hero; and
                  running to the church-yard wall, he leaped over it, and repaired to the spot were
                  the horse and chaise had been left.</p>
               <p>Finding all in safety, he entered the vehicle, and drove off rapidly. He had
                  proceeded but a short distance down the cross-road leading to the main turnpike,
                  when he encountered several men belonging to the village, who were returning from
                  Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>An idea struck our hero. "Those poor devils," said he to himself—"may perish in
                  that grave, unless they are taken out. I will inform these countrymen of their
                  situation; but I must do it in such a manner that they will not suspect the true
                  circumstances of the case."</p>
               <p>Checking the horse, he addressed the countrymen, who had civilly withdrawn
                  themselves to one side of the narrow road, in order to let him pass; for, from the
                  style of the equipage, they imagined Jack to be some gentleman of consequence, an
                  opinion that was confirmed by the lofty and patronising tone of superiority which
                  he assumed. As for the prison garb which he still wore, there was nothing in the
                  dark grey cloth of which it was made, sufficiently remarkable to excite suspicion,
                  or even to attract attention, at night.</p>
               <p>"My good fellows," said Jack—"I am a Philadelphia physician, and have been a few
                  miles beyond your village to attend a sick patient. On my return, while passing
                  the church-yard just above, I noticed two men within the enclosure, who appeared
                  to be occupied in a suspicious manner. Knowing that there are wretches in the
                  employ of unprincipled members of the medical faculty, who do not scruple to rob
                  the grave of its inmate, I cautiously watched these men, and soon became convinced
                  that they were what is called <emph>resurrectionists,</emph> or
                     <emph>body-snatchers.</emph>—Though I myself am devoted science, I never have
                  resorted to such a diabolical method of acquiring scientific knowledge. Therefore,
                  fired with indignation, I sprang over the <unclear>wall of</unclear> the
                  church-yard and rushed upon the villains. After a severe struggle, I succeeded in
                  hurling them both into the grave which they had defiled; and I am now hastening to
                  the city in order to summon a sufficient police force to take these wretches into
                  custody, that they may receive the punishment due to their unnatural crime.
                  Meanwhile, my honest fellows, you will confer a favor upon humanity and the cause
                  of justice by going and securing the robbers of the dead; as otherwise they may
                  possibly make their escape, before I can return with the officers."</p>
               <p>"We'll take care of the scoundrels, your honor," replied one of the
                  countrymen—"but will you be good enough to tell us in what part of the churchyard
                  the grave be, what you throw'd them into?"</p>
               <p>"The grave is situated in the extreme north-east corner," answered Jack.</p>
               <p>"What! is it a grave without a tomb-stone, nearest the wall, with two willows
                  growing not far from it?"</p>
               <p>"The very same," replied our hero, much surprised.</p>
               <p>The countryman gave utterance to a deep and terrible oath, and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"It is the grave of my wife, whom I buried a fortnight ago! Follow me, comrades,
                  and we'll take the law into our own hands, and lynch the villains! death to the
                  robbers of the dead!"</p>
               <p>"Ay! death to the robbers of the dead!" cried the others; and the whole party of
                  countrymen rushed off towards the churchyard, at headlong speed.</p>
               <p>"I fear that it will go hard with the warden and the parson," thought Jack—"but
                  they deserve some punishment for their avarice. Their motives in searching for the
                  supposed treasure, were entirely selfish. The parson, in particular, merits
                  chastisement, he is such a confounded hypocrite. I should like to stay and see the
                  result of this strange affair; but I must not compromise my safety. Now for the
                  road-side inn and the chamber of the pretty Mary Wilson! A year's abstinence from
                  lovely woman's caresses, renders a fellow furious! Dash on, my gallant steed!
                  Bright star of fortune, I thank thee!"</p>
               <p>Highly elated with the complete success of his daring and ingenious plan, Jack
                  drove at full speed towards the abode of the pretty Mary.</p>
               <p>Let us, in the meantime, return to a couple of very respectable gentlemen, whom we
                  left in what may be termed a "peculiarly perplexing predicament."</p>

               <head type="sub">LYNCH LAW.</head>
               <p>Although Mr. Fox, the dignified warden of the Eastern Penitentiary, seldom
                  indulged in the luxury of swearing, he found it impossible to repress a few
                  muttered curses, on finding himself at the bottom of a deep grave, in close
                  companionship with a corpse, and nearly suffocated by the earth which had been so
                  plentifully showered upon his head. He had also to endure the pangs of
                  disappointment, in relation to the expected treasure; and the mortifying
                  reflection that he had lost a prisoner solely on account of his own credulity and
                  avarice, embittered his feelings still more.</p>
               <p>As for the parson, he soon recovered his senses. Starting to his feet, he glanced
                  at the pale face of the corpse with a shudder; and then, addressing his partner in
                  misfortune, he said—</p>
               <p>"We have both been regularly victimized, and the least said about this affair the
                  better. Our first object is to get out of this horrible hole. Permit me to mount
                  upon your shoulders that I may extricate myself, which being done, I will help
                     <emph>you</emph> up."</p>
               <p>The warden did not much like this arrangement; however, he submitted<pb n="82-83"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000040"/> for he was as anxious to get out of the grave as
                  his reverend friend.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spoons having gained the surface of the "upper earth," took hold of the hands
                  of Mr. Fox, and with much difficulty succeeded in placing that gentleman also upon
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">terra firma.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>They had scarcely time to congratulate themselves on their liberation from so
                  horrible a captivity, when they found themselves in the rough grasp of half a
                  dozen men—the countrymen whom Jack had met upon the road.</p>
               <p>These men began to beat and bruise the warden and the parson most sorely, at the
                  same time loudly vociferating—</p>
               <p>"Death to the robbers of the dead!"</p>
               <p>"Death to the villains who have dishonored the grave of my wife, and would have
                  stolen her corpse!" thundered one of the countrymen, who had been gazing down into
                  the violated grave, with tearful eyes.</p>
               <p>"Away with them—let us hang them upon the nearest tree!" cried the others.</p>
               <p>A short time previous to these events, a grave in that same church-yard had
                  actually been robbed of the body of a most respectable inhabitant of the village;
                  and this circumstance will account for the fury displayed by the countrymen, on
                  getting the supposed grave-robbers into their power.</p>
               <p>"These must be the same rascals as robbed the grave of 'Squire Goodwin, three
                  weeks ago!" exclaimed one of the men.</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay—we've caught them, sure enough," said another—"let's hang them without
                  judge or jury; this tree will serve for a gallows, and I've got a strong cord in
                  my pocket!"</p>
               <p>Up to this moment, Messrs. Fox and, Spoons had been too much frightened and
                  bewildered to attempt any explanation of the situation in which they had been
                  found. But the immediate prospect of being strung up by the neck, suddenly
                  restored them to their senses, for the close contemplation of a halter, when it is
                  apparently destined to encircle one's own neck, can scarcely fail to set a fellow
                  into a "devil of a thinking."</p>
               <p>Seeing the necessity of making the most powerful efforts, in order to avoid the
                  unpleasant contraction of their wind-pipes, the warden and the parson now
                  attempted to explain; but as, in their eagerness to be heard, they kept
                  continually interrupting each other, they merely created confusion, instead of
                  producing any impression in their favor.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, you mistake; I am the warden—"</p>
               <p>"You do me injustice, gentlemen; I am the chaplain—"</p>
               <p>"I am a respectable man, and—"</p>
               <p>"I am a Christian minister, and—"</p>
               <p>"You take me for a grave-robber but—"</p>
               <p>"You suppose me to be a villain but—"</p>
               <p>"I came here, supposing that a treasure—"</p>
               <p>"A damned rascal of a prisoner told me that a treasure—"</p>
               <p>"For heaven's sake, listen—"</p>
               <p>"My explanation, gentlemen, is—"</p>
               <p>"Help, help!"</p>
               <p>"Murder, murder, mur—d—e—r!"</p>
               <p>Totally disregarding these protestations and cries, which in truth, they did not
                  understand, the enraged countrymen dragged the two victims to a neighboring tree,
                  and prepared to put in force that summary and diabolical system known throughout
                  the South and West as <emph>lynch law.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>We called it a diabolical system, and it is so. It is truly horrible to see a
                  crowd of men, crazy with excitement, and perhaps drunk with rum, usurping the
                  sacred powers of regularly constituted law—in other words," taking the law into
                  their own hands"—and drugging some poor devil to a sudden and violent death, upon
                  the mere <emph>suspicion</emph> of crime, without allowing him the inalienable
                  right of the greatest criminal upon the face of the earth—the right of enjoying an
                  impartial trial, by a jury of his country.</p>
               <p>It is also horrible to behold the indifference with which such outrages against
                  law and justice, are regarded, particularly by the press, which often alludes to
                  these flagrant acts as the "pardonable excesses of a justly-indignant
                  populace!"</p>
               <p>The general prevalence of "lynch law" would afford a splendid opportunity for any
                  malignant or envious wretch to accomplish the destruction of an enemy or a rival.
                  He would only be obliged to put in circulation some infamous falsehood concerning
                  his destined victim, who, with the public indignation strongly excited against
                  him, would be liable at any moment to be dragged forth by a ruthless mob, and hung
                  up like a dog!</p>
               <p>Every participant in such an outrage should receive the punishment due to a
                  deliberate murderer.</p>
               <p>The writer of these pages has seen a man, in a Southern state—the boasted abode of
                  chivalry and honor—a man merely <emph>accused</emph> of an odious crime, bound to
                  a stake and <emph>deliberately roasted to death over a slow fire;</emph> and the
                  crowd stood calmly by, and surveyed the victim's writhing limbs, and listened to
                  his groans of agony; yes, that <unclear>mob</unclear> of infernal miscreants, who
                  would disgrace the black portals of hell itself, looked coolly on, and
                  laughed!</p>
               <p>Such is the infamous "lynch law."</p>
               <p>Let us resume our narrative.</p>
               <p>The warden and the parson were dragged to a neighboring tree, whose thick trunk
                  and strong projecting branches seemed to be well adapted to the fatal purpose
                  which the countrymen had in view.</p>
               <p>One of these honest but misguided men took from his pocket a long and stout cord.
                  A running noose was made at one end, and placed around the neck of the parson,
                  who, it was determined, should be the first victim.</p>
               <p>The other end of the cord was then thrown over one of the limbs of the tree. The
                  arms of the poor parson having been bound with a handkerchief, the men grasped the
                  cord, and prepared to give a "long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all
                  together."</p>
               <p>The warden, meanwhile, apprehending that his turn would come next, lay upon the
                  ground quivering with terror, and begging for mercy.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE UNWELCOME BATH.</head>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Spoons, feeling assured that his time had come, suddenly became
                  struck with the idea that he was a very great sinner, and needed some little
                  preparation prior to being hurried into another world. There fore, he asked to be
                  allowed the space of five minutes, for prayer.</p>
               <p>This reasonable request being granted, the parson began to mutter a supplication
                  for divine mercy, which, if not so eloquent as those which he was accustomed to
                  deliver in the pulpit, was certainly a great deal more sincere.</p>
               <p>This delay, brief as it was, proved the means of saving those men from committing
                  the crime of murder. Their blood having time to cool, they began to ask themselves
                  if they were not going too far in the matter, and if the consequences of the act
                  might not prove disastrous to themselves; for lynch law does not flourish with
                  entire impunity in the vicinity of Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>The result was, that they held a whispered consultation among themselves; and came
                  to the conclusion of abandoning their original design of putting the supposed
                  grave-robbers to death.</p>
               <p>They nevertheless determined to inflict a severe punishment upon our<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000041"/> friends the warden and the parson, and then hand
                  them over to justice.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, Mr. Spoons was released from his unpleasant and dangerous situation,
                  to the great joy of himself and the warden—the latter of whom saw, in his
                  companion's liberation from the halter, an assurance of his own safety.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," cried the delighted Mr. Spoons—"suffer me, on behalf of myself and
                  friends, to thank you for having rectified your mistake in time, and——"</p>
               <p>"Silence!" harshly interrupted one of the men, who seemed to have some influence
                  over the rest—"silence; we don't want any thanks or explanations. As for our being
                  mistaken, it's no such thing; you are a couple of rascally doctors, most likely;
                  and it's lucky that the good gentleman, whom we met in the chaise, caught you in
                  your rascality. You'll both be sent to the Eastern Penitentiary for this night's
                  work."</p>
               <p>"Would to heaven that I were in the Eastern Penitentiary now!" groaned the
                  respectable warden of that institution.</p>
               <p>"Amen!" responded the chaplain of the same agreeable edifice.</p>
               <p>"The prisoner has not only made his escape, but he has also stolen my horse and
                  chaise; for these fellows just now spoke of the <emph>gentleman</emph> whom they
                  met in the chaise," muttered Mr. Fox.</p>
               <p>"We are a pair of d—d fools," sighed Mr. Spoons.</p>
               <p>The whole party having got over the church-yard wall, entered the village, and
                  approached a large and deep pond of water situated in a vacant lot. This pond was
                  stagnant; a green scum covered its surface, and many a gigantic bull-frog revelled
                  in its mud, or croaked his hoarse song upon its banks.</p>
               <p>The warden and the parson exchanged looks of terror, as they advanced towards the
                  pond; for they suspected that they were doomed to become too familiarly acquainted
                  with its sweets. All doubts on the subject were soon set at rest, when the rope
                  which had so recently adorned the parson's neck, was securely adjusted around that
                  gentleman's waist.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spoons now made another attempt to enter into explanations; for, being a dandy
                  who prided himself greatly upon the elegance of his dress and appearance, the
                  prospect of being saturated and half stifled with the filthy waters of that foul
                  ditch, was most dreadful to him. He was, however, quickly silenced by the
                  assurance that if he objected to the punishment, he should be conveyed back to the
                  churchyard, and strung up to the tree. So, of two evils, Mr. Spoons wisely chose
                  the least.</p>
               <p>And now was enacted a scene which would have been extremely ludicrous, could a
                  spectator have divested himself of every feeling of pity for the hapless victim,
                  who was the principal performer.</p>
               <p>The sturdy countrymen, taking the parson up bodily, threw him headlong into the
                  pond, and laughed as they saw him floundering in the soft and slimy mud. Whenever
                  they thought that he was in danger of being drowned or stifled, they would bring
                  him to the shore by violently jerking the rope that was attached to his waist; and
                  then, as soon as he had blown the mud from his mouth and nostrils, and recovered
                  breath, they would plunge him in again, to repeat the performance.</p>
               <p>When the poor parson had become thoroughly exhausted, they released him, and
                  transferred the rope to the waist of the warden. This gentleman, with a degree of
                     <emph>cunning</emph> very appropriate to his name, tightly held his
                  handkerchief to his mouth and nostrils; so that, when his tormentors threw him
                  into the pond, he imbibed but a very small quantity of the fifth. Moreover when
                  they drew him to the shore, he lay perfectly still, and pretended to be
                  insensible. The countrymen, little suspecting that he was merely playing "possum,"
                  concluded that he had been sufficiently punished, and desisted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fox, finding that the ordeal was over, soon recovered from his "swoon;" and he
                  then asked if he and his friend were at liberty to depart? The reply was a most
                  decided negative.</p>
               <p>"You don't get off so easy," said the fellow who acted as chief spokesman of the
                  party—"a mere ducking in the pond ain't half punishment enough for such a crime as
                  yours. You must go with us to the lockup, and in the morning Justice Beeswax will
                  dispose of you as he thinks proper. Me and my comrades will receive the thanks of
                  the community for bringing two such villains to justice; perhaps we may get
                  liberally rewarded—who knows?"</p>
               <p>"Ay—who knows?" echoed the others, in concert; and then, seizing Messrs Fox and
                  Spoons in no gentle grasp, they escorted those unfortunate and ill-fated gentlemen
                  towards the village "lock-up."</p>
               <p>On their way, they stopped at the residence of the village constable, in order to
                  arouse that high functionary, so that their proceedings might receive a sort of
                  official sanction; for, to tell the truth, they were not without some secret
                  misgivings as to the final result of that night's violent operations.—Being now
                  pretty well "cooled off," they began to fear that they had gone almost too
                  far.</p>
               <p>They had another object in summoning Constable Crawl: that officer kept the key of
                  the lock-up, and his presence was absolutely necessary to the incarceration of the
                  prisoners. He soon made his appearance, in the person of a small, mean-looking
                  man, with the eyes of a reptile, and a countenance suggestive of petty
                  larceny.</p>
               <p>On hearing a brief statement of the case, Constable Crawl not only approved of the
                  conduct of the countrymen but also assured them that they would receive the thanks
                  of the nation, for their patriotism and heroic courage in arresting the two
                  prisoners, who (he said) were old offenders, having often been in his official
                  grip for various crimes and misdemeanors. Thus comforted and sustained by the
                  approbation of a distinguished pillar of the law, the fears of the countrymen
                  vanished, and they rejoiced exceedingly.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE VILLAGE BASTILE.</head>
               <p>"Fellows!" cried Constable Crawl, fiercely addressing the prisoners—"I am about to
                  question you. Be very careful, for your answers will be brought forward in a court
                  of justice as evidence. You look like old convicts; have you not both been in the
                  Eastern Penitentiary?"</p>
               <p>"We have been there, but not——"</p>
               <p>"I thought so!" cried the constable, in a tone of triumph, and vastly delighted
                  with his own wonderful penetration—"I thought so. You are now in a fair way to get
                  back to your old quarters. Come—you must go to the lock-up; in the morning, the
                  justice will <emph>settle your hash.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Under the formidable escort of the constable and the countrymen, Messrs. Spoons
                  and Fox were now conducted to the village Bastile, which was a small brick edifice
                  without any great pretensions to architectural beauty, being built somewhat in the
                  shape of a Dutch oven. Windows there were none; but then there was an iron door of
                  very decided appearance, and the said door was furnished with a grating to admit
                  light and air.</p>
               <p>Producing from the depths of his pocket a key, which had been keeping<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000042"/> company with four brass quarters, a small bottle of
                  medicine and a syringe, Constable Crawl unlocked the door of the Bastile with the
                  inflexible air of a jailor who wasn't to be bribed, and ordered the two prisoners
                  to enter.—They obeyed, and the door having been closed and locked upon them, Mr.
                  Crawl and his followers departed.</p>
               <p>The moonlight which shone through the grating in the door, enabled the warden and
                  the parson to see that the dungeon, which was about ten feet square, was destitute
                  of even an apology for a bed, and was besides so disgustingly filthy in every
                  part, as to render it almost impossible to move an inch with defiling the person.
                  However, the recent close intimacy of our friends with the stagnant pond had
                  already so besmeared them, that they cared but little for the dirt of their
                  dungeon; and accordingly they threw themselves upon the stone floor to await the
                  arrival of the morrow, when they knew that they would experience no difficulty in
                  gaining their liberation.</p>
               <p>"It is hard," groaned the warden, as he and his companion condoled with each other
                  upon their manifold misfortunes—"it is hard that I, who have turned a key upon so
                  many prisoners, should now have a key turned upon me. This night's work will be
                  the death of me, I fear; the soaking I received in that accursed pond will
                  increase my rheumatism, and I shall be obliged to hobble on crutches for the rest
                  of my days. Oh! why did I believe the tale of that artful young villain? To what a
                  series of misfortunes has my blind credulity subjected me! I have been
                  disappointed in my expectations of finding gold! I have been cast into a grave,
                  and nearly buried alive; I have lost a <emph>life</emph> prisoner, and been robbed
                  of a valuable horse and chaise; I have narrowly escaped being hung; and now, after
                  having been nearly drowned in a foul ditch, I am thrust into this filthy len, to
                  be arraigned in the morning before a magistrate, like a criminal, on the odious
                  charge of attempting to steal a corpse! In addition to all this, I shall become a
                  laughing-stock for every body, and perhaps lose my situation as warden. Oh, cursed
                  fate! and oh, thrice miserable Fox!"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" cried Mr. Spoons—"I also have cause to mourn, and groan in anguish of
                  spirit. It was mainly in consequence of my persuasions that you consented to enter
                  upon this unfortunate enterprise; otherwise we might both, at this moment, have
                  been comfortably seated in the prison office, discussing your own particular and
                  private Cogniac. I shall never be able to divest myself of the choking sensation
                  produced by the infernal rope which encircled my neck; and I feel that my ducking
                  in the pond has forever morally degraded me. But oh! worse than all—that immersion
                  in filth—that unholy baptism in the foul waters of the "Slough of Despond," has
                  irretrievably ruined my best suit of clothes, which, although unpaid for, were
                  dear to my heart. Alas, too credulous tailor! I fear me much that thou art
                  destined never to receive the dimes for the elegant productions of thy divine
                  needle! And oh! thou too chaste washerwoman—Mrs. Suds—thou who hast so often
                  rejected my amorous advances, can thy artistic skill ever eradicate from this foul
                  linen these ignoble stains? Alas, poor Spoons! thou has indeed fallen from thine
                  high estate!"</p>
               <p>The lamentations of the parson were here interrupted by a voice which apparently
                  issued from some foreign quarter of the Bastile. Upon examination, it was
                  discovered that the strange voice proceeded from a head of forbidding aspect, and
                  also that the eyes belonging to the said head were anxiously peering through the
                  grating in the dungeon door. A further investigation developed the fact that the
                  voice, head and eyes were the personal property of Mr. Constable Crawl.</p>
               <p>"Hullo, you fellows in there!" said Mr. Crawl, in a tone that was intended to be
                  condescending.</p>
               <p>"What do you wish?" asked the prisoners, meekly; for a thorough soaking in a
                  stagnant pond hath a marvellous tendency to subdue the spirit of the most
                  valiant.</p>
               <p>"I am disposed," said the great man, with an air of lofty benevolence—" to treat
                  you with kindness; for, after all, are you not my fellow beings, made, like
                  myself, in the image of a benificent Creator?"</p>
               <p>Now this was a great concession on the part of the constable—an acknowledgement
                  that those degraded captives belonged to the same noble species of which he,
                  Crawl, was so superb a specimen. The warden and the parson therefore expressed
                  their gratitude with becoming humility, although they could not help thinking that
                  if the constable was really an image of his Creator, the said image was very
                  indifferently executed, and must have been "got up" during and unusual press of
                  business.</p>
               <p>"Yes," continued Mr. Crawl—"although you are doubtless great villains, and worthy
                  of the extreme penalty of the law, I will be merciful. I will batter the edge of
                  the sword of Justice, so that it shall not utterly destroy you.—I will place a
                  couple of brick-bats under the wheels of the Car of the Constitution of the United
                  States, so that you may not be entirely crushed, like mashed turnips. What amount
                  of money have you in your possession?"</p>
               <p>"That is a strange question," remarked Mr. Fox—"why do yon ask?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Crawl, having looked cautiously around, in order to assure himself that there
                  were no listeners near, thrust his nose still further through the grating, and
                  said, in a low tone—</p>
               <p>"Give me ten dollars, and I will release you from confinement."</p>
               <p>"You mean to say——"</p>
               <p>"Exactly so. I will let you go for ten dollars, and so arrange things as to lead
                  to the belief that you managed your own escape."</p>
               <p>"Then you will accept of a bribe?"</p>
               <p>"Hush! that's an ugly word; don't use it. Not a bribe, but a <emph>present</emph>
                  you know."</p>
               <p>The warden and the parson, having consulted together, concluded to accept the
                  constables offer; for, although they were sure to be liberated in the morning,
                  upon establishing their true identity, they preferred to avoid, as far as possible
                  the exposure of their treasure-seeking expedition.</p>
               <p>Therefore, they began to investigate their pockets, in order to make up the
                  required sum; but soon found to their consternation, that their joint finances
                  fell rather short of the amount necessary to "pay the turnpike toll of a
                  walking-stick"—by which elegant simile we mean to convey the fact that neither of
                  them was, at <emph>that moment,</emph> in possession of a single farthing; all
                  their loose change having been paid to old Wilson, for refreshments at the
                  road-side inn.</p>
               <p>They therefore announced to Mr. Crawl their inability to comply with his demands;
                  but that gentleman, supposing that they merely wished him to lower the "price of
                  liberty," intimated his willingness to "let them slide" for one half the sum which
                  he had named.</p>
               <p>"Unfortunately," said Mr. Fox—"neither my friend here nor myself can immediately
                  reward you for setting us at liberty, as we are both out of funds. However, I will
                  pledge you my word of honor——"</p>
               <p>"Gammon!" interrupted Mr. Crawl, whose ideas of honor were very obscure—"if you
                  are such poor devils that you can't pay five dollars, you may stay in your dungeon
                  through all eternity, for what I care."</p>
               <p>So saying, the indignant and disappointed constable discharged a superannuated<pb
                     n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8051-00000043"/> perannuated quid of tobacco through the
                  grating, at the prisoners; and having in this manner soothed his injured feelings,
                  he departed and bent his steps homeward, where he resolved to enjoy such
                  consolation as might be derived from a mysterious looking black bottle which
                  occupied a corner of the upper shelf in his cupboard, and whose contents emitted
                  an odor suspiciously resembling the villainous smell of very bad brandy.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE MAGISTRATE.</head>
               <p>Left again "alone in their glory," the warden and the parson prepared to pass the
                  night in as comfortable a manner as was possible in view of the wretched plight in
                  which they found themselves.</p>
               <p>It soon, however, became apparent that the privilege of repose, even in that
                  miserable place, was to be denied them; for they were assailed by a legion of
                  half-starved rats. These disgusting creatures came upon them in swarms, and seemed
                  determined to banquet upon their carcasses. Messrs. Spoons and Fox were obliged to
                  act upon the defensive, in order to preserve themselves from being actually torn
                  in pieces by their loathsome enemies, which frequently leaped upon them in
                  numbers, fastening their sharp teeth in the flesh of these two most unfortunate of
                  gentleman.</p>
               <p>The whole night was occupied with this description of warfare, and it was not
                  until daylight had begun to struggle in through the grating of the dungeon door,
                  that the invading army retreated from the field of battle</p>
               <p>It seemed, however, that the rats had only retired in order to give place to
                  another set of persecutors, who were almost equally annoying. For the report that
                  two grave-robbers had been arrested the preceding night, had spread through the
                  village, and before sun-rise nearly the whole population, men, women and children
                  had repaired to the lock-up, in order to have a view of the two desperate villains
                  who had been caught in the very act of stealing the person of a very respectable
                  lady who had the misfortune to be dead.</p>
               <p>Gathered around the door of the Bastile, the crowd pushed and struggled to obtain
                  a peep at the supposed grave-robbers, who found themselves the objects of a
                  curiosity that was rather annoying, particularly as the spectators were very free
                  with their remarks.</p>
               <p>"A pair of gallows birds," said one.</p>
               <p>"Villainly is written in their looks," said another.</p>
               <p>"They are a couple of ugly thieves," sneered a woman who rejoiced in such personal
                  attractions as red hair, a turnup nose, and a terrific squint.</p>
               <p>"I despise a thief of any kind," remarked a fellow who had recently been
                  discharged from the Eastern Penitentiary, where he had been confined during a term
                  of one year for robbing a blind beggar of a dollar's worth of coppers. On taking a
                  closer view of the inmates of the Bastile, this man instantly recognised the
                  warden of the institution from which he had so lately emerged. With a muttered
                  exclamation of astonishment, he immediately made himself scarce.</p>
               <p>"Here comes Constable Crawl!" observed some one in the crowd, as that high officer
                  at last made his appearance with an air of dignity that struck awe and terror to
                  the soul of every spectator.</p>
               <p>"Make room, here, make room!" cried Constable Crawl; and producing the key of the
                  Bastile, he unlocked the door, and commanded the prisoners to come forth. The
                  warden and the parson obeyed; and, escorted by the constable, and surrounded by
                  the rabble, they were conlucted to the office of Justice Beeswax, which was
                  situated near.</p>
               <p>The appearance of the prisoners was certainly not in their favor, they being
                  covered with filth from head to feet; yet the prospect of their being soon
                  released somewhat encouraged them.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes the magistrate entered the office and took his seat.—Justice
                  Beeswax was an elderly gentleman with a kind and open countenance; and he surveyed
                  the wretched looking prisoners with an air of benevolent pity.</p>
               <p>The office was crowded with the inhabitants of the village, all anxious to behold
                  the proceedings. Conspicuous among the crowd were the six country-men who had
                  arrested the prisoners and treated them with such extreme severity.</p>
               <p>Constable Crawl, armed with his staff of office, stood near the culprits, whom he
                  eyed with an expression of stern integrity and holy horror that was quite
                  refreshing to behold.</p>
               <p>The worthy magistrate, having adjusted his spectacles, and taken an agitated pinch
                  of snuff, thus addressed the accused:—</p>
               <p>"I am truly sorry to have two such respectable looking men brought before me on a
                  charge so odious and so disgraceful; for, notwithstanding your filthy condition, I
                  can readily perceive that your looks, as well as your garments, are what the world
                  calls respectable. How came you both in your present very unclean state? Who are
                  you, and what are your names?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Jedediah Fox, and I am the warden of the Eastern Penitentiary."</p>
               <p>"And I," added the parson—"am the Reverend Sylvester Spoons, the chaplain of the
                  same institution."</p>
               <p>A murmur of indignant astonishment ran around the office, excited by those
                  apparent ridiculous falsehoods on the part of the prisoners. Mr. Crawl put on a
                  look of lofty contempt, which did him great credit; for it is very difficult to
                  express the feelings of contempt with a nose of the pug and rummy order, to which
                  class the proboscis of the constable belonged.</p>
               <p>The Justice, on hearing the replies of the accused, surveyed them attentively for
                  a few moments. Then, appearing to recognize them, he started slightly, and his
                  looks betrayed profound surprise.</p>
               <p>Rising from his seat, he requested them to follow him <emph>into an
                     adjoining</emph> room, which being done, the door was closed upon the staring
                  crowd, who marvelled greatly at this strange proceeding.</p>
               <p>"I don't understand this at all," muttered Mr. Crawl, with a look of be wilderment
                  and chagrin.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE TABLES TURNED.</head>
               <p>Half an hour elapsed, during which time Messrs Fox and Spoons, both of whom were
                  known by sight to the Justice, fully explained everything to the entire
                  satisfaction of that excellent magistrate.</p>
               <p>When Justice Beeswax and the prisoners again made their appearance in the office,
                  great was the astonishment of the spectators to see the Justice hand the supposed
                  culprits a couple of chairs, and request them to be seated, with an air of almost
                  obsequious politeness!</p>
               <p>"What in the devil's name can all this mean?" muttered Mr. Crawl, with much
                  uneasiness.</p>
               <p>The magistrate took his seat, and assumed an expression and tone of unusual
                  sternness, as he said—</p>
               <p>"Let the six persons who arrested these gentlemen last night. stand forward."</p>
               <p>The countrymen, expecting to be publicly applauded and perhaps rewarded<pb
                     n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8051-00000044"/> warded, for the <emph>valor</emph> which
                  they had displayed, stepped from the crowd, and took their places in front of the
                  magistrate's desk.</p>
               <p>"Let a messenger be despatched for the Deputy Sheriff and a couple of constables,"
                  continued the Justice—"for we may have a number of prisoners to be taken care of,
                  if I am not greatly mistaken."</p>
               <p>On hearing this, the six countrymen glanced at each other with looks of alarm.
                  Constable Crawl, considering that the sending for an additional constabulary force
                  was an insult to <emph>him,</emph> as reflecting upon his own inefficiency,
                  mustered up courage to say to the Justice—</p>
               <p>"Please your honor, I can take care of the these two prisoners very well; I don't
                  think it necessary to send for any help."</p>
               <p>"Silence, sir!" thundered the magistrate—"lay down your staff of office and take
                  your seat. I shall have something to say to <emph>you,</emph> presently."</p>
               <p>Mr. Crawl obeyed, with a wondering and chop-fallen air. He couldn't understand the
                  thing at all; yet he had a vague fear that the Justice had been made acquainted
                  with his offer to liberate the prisoners for money.</p>
               <p>Justice Beeswax now addressed the six countrymen, who stood before him with an
                  expression of painful uncertainty stamped upon their rather sheepish-looking
                  countenances:—</p>
               <p>"My friends, I regret to say that you have placed yourselves in a very unfortunate
                  position. These two gentlemen, whom you arrested last night, are really what they
                  have represented themselves to be—Mr. Fox, and the Reverend Mr. Spoons, the warden
                  and chaplain of the Eastern Penitentiary."</p>
               <p>At these words, the six countrymen were astounded—Mr. Crawl was frightened, while
                  the spectators awaited with breathless interest the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >denouement</foreign> of this strange and mysterious affair.</p>
               <p>The magistrate continued:—</p>
               <p>"These gentlemen, having reason to suppose that stolen treasures were buried in
                  our church-yard, had dug for them, little suspecting that they were intruding upon
                  the sacred quiet of a grave. A convict in the prison, in order to accomplish a
                  certain object, had deceived them: but they have nothing whatever to reproach
                  themselves with, in regard to the matter."</p>
               <p>The countrymen, thinking that they had now heard the worst of the affair, felt
                  their fears vanish; and one of them, the spokesman of the party, observed to the
                  magistrate—</p>
               <p>"We are right glad, your honor, that the gentlemen are not the villains that we
                  took them for. However, your can't say but that we did perfectly right in
                  arresting them as we did; for we found them in very suspicious circumstances."</p>
               <p>"I confess," said the Justice—"that the circumstances <emph>were</emph>
                  suspicious—extremely so; and it was your duty, as good citizens, to arrest them.
                  Thus far, you did perfectly right, and I commend your zeal. But what has
                  transpired after you had arrested those gentlemen?"</p>
               <p>The countrymen looked confused, and held their peace; and the magistrate
                  continued, in a tone of severity—</p>
               <p>"You seem to be forgetful of the events of last night; permit me to refresh your
                  memories, Instead of questioning the gentlemen, in order to see what account they
                  could give of themselves, you refused to hear one word of the explanation, which
                  they were anxious to make. Instead of peaceably delivering them into the custody
                  of an officer, as persons whom you believed you had detected in the commission of
                  an unlawful and criminal act, you began by violently assaulting them, which, to
                  say the least, considering your superior numbers, was unmanly and cowardly. Not
                  content with this, you determined to commit a still greater outrage—an outrage
                  which, had it been consummated, would have brought you to the same punishment as
                  that which you designed for the two victims of your brutality. You placed the
                  lives of these gentlemen in jeopardy; and 'tis fortunate for you, that you
                  refrained from committing the crime of murder. But, although you concluded to
                  spare the lives of these innocent victims of unfortunate circumstances, your
                  insane thirst for outrage was not yet satisfied; and, dragging them to that foul
                  and stagnant pond which is a disgrace to our village, you cast them in, the one
                  after the other, and gloated upon their struggles for air and life, until death
                  had nearly snatched them from the grasp of your brutality. Answer me, all of
                  you—is this true?"</p>
               <p>The countrymen had not the audacity to deny the facts so clearly stated, and each
                  of them acknowledged that it <emph>was</emph> true.</p>
               <p>At this point of the proceedings, the Deputy Sheriff and several constables
                  entered the office. The Justice, having motioned them to remain in attendance,
                  continued his remarks to the valiant and now trembling captors of the warden and
                  the parson;—</p>
               <p>"My duty in this case is a painful one, but it is none the less imperative on that
                  account. I believe you to be honest, well-meaning men, who have been led into this
                  deplorable error by angry excitement; yet, as Mr. Fox and the Rev. Mr. Spoons have
                  entered a formal complaint against you all, for endangering their lives and also
                  for an aggravated assault upon each of them, I have no alternative but to bind you
                  over for trial at the next term of the Court of Sesssions. I shall require each of
                  you to give security for your appearance, in the sum of one thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>Scarcely believing the evidence of their own senses, the six countrymen, with
                  mouth and eyes wide open, stared at the magistrate and at each other with looks of
                  bewilderment that were very natural, considering the expectations which they had
                  formed of receiving both approbation and reward for their valorous conduct on the
                  preceding night. They were, soon however, aroused from their stupor, and made
                  sensible of all the painful realities of their situation, when the Deputy Sheriff,
                  calling them aside, inquired of them whether they could produce the required bonds
                  for their appearance at court?</p>
               <p>Being nothing but poor laboring men and as destitute of wealthy friends as poor
                  laboring men almost invariably are, not one of them could get bail; and
                  consequently they were carried off and provided with accommodations in the county
                  jail; there to await their trial—a warning to all those rash and hot-headed
                  republicans who descant on the propriety and justice of an indignant populace
                  "taking the law into their own hands."</p>
               <p>This matter being disposed of, Justice Beeswax turned to Constable Crawl, and
                  sternly said to that high-minded and incorruptible functionary, who seemed to be
                  about as much at his ease as though he were seated upon a bed of hot coals—</p>
               <p>"So, sir, it seems that you are in the habit of proposing to release prisoners, on
                  condition of their rewarding your kindness by making you <emph>presents!</emph>—In
                  other words, you are not only willing but anxious to accept of bribes. I have long
                  suspected you of this rascality; and I now fully understand the heretofore
                  mysterious manner in which so many prisoners have disappeared from the lock-up.
                  Leave the office, sir; I shall take good care that from this day henceforth you
                  never again occupy the office of constable."</p>
               <p>Mr. Crawl crawled off with a very miserable and sheepish air; and Justice Beeswax
                  announced to the auditors that they might retire, the business of the office being
                  concluded.</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8051-00000045"/>
               <p>The warden and the parson, having thanked the worthy magistrate for the justice
                  which he had done them, obtained a conveyance to the prison, where they arrived in
                  safety after so many strange and perilous adventures.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the treasure-seeking exdepition of Messrs. Spoons and Fox. This portion
                  of our narrative is not an exaggeration, but is strictly fonnded on truth in all
                  its essential details. Of later years, a convict in the Massachusetts State Prison
                  successfully carried out a somewhat similar "game," but he was afterwards
                  re-captured.</p>
               <p>We may as well here state that the six countrymen who had so severely maltreated
                  the warden and the parson, were are all convicted, on trial, of aggravated
                  assault, and they were each and severally sentenced to one year's imprisonment in
                  the Eastern Penitentiary. Consequently, they were made partakers of the
                  hospitality of Mr. Fox, and also had the satisfaction of listening to the
                  spiritual teachings of the Rev. Mr. Spoons; but we doubt very much whether their
                  introduction, as prisoners, to their former victims of the stagnant pond,
                  contributed greatly to the comfort of their situation, while inmates of the
                  "Solitary Prison."</p>
               <p>We now return to Jack Harold, whom we left on his way to the roadside inn, and to
                  the arms of pretty Mary Wilson—after having possosssed himself of a horse and
                  chaise, and gained, what was of far greater importance—<emph>his liberty.</emph>

               <head type="sub">THE GUILTY LOVERS.</head>
               <p>Like a faithful and impartial animal as he was, the good steed of Mr. Fox trotted
                  away as cheerfully and as rapidly under the guidance of the escaped prisoner, as
                  when the warden himself, the legitimate owner, held the reins.</p>
               <p>The little road-side inn, with its swinging sign, soon "hove in sight," as the
                  sailors say; and Jack, having leaped out of the chaise and fastened the horse in
                  an obscure and convenient place, approached the inn, which was now closed for the
                  night.</p>
               <p>Recollecting the directions which the pretty Mary Wilson had given him, nearly a
                  year previously, Jack glanced up at the windows with the white curtains which
                  served to indicate her chamber. A light was faintly gleaming from that chamber,
                  and the shadow of a human form moving about assured our hero that the young girl
                  had not retired to rest.</p>
               <p>"She is expecting me, that beautiful creature!" murmured Jack; and a thrill of
                  delight tingled through his frame, as he anticipated the raptures which he was to
                  enjoy in the society of the charming girl.</p>
               <p>Going around to the stable, he found a ladder that was well adapted to the
                  purpose. This he conveyed to the front of the house, and having placed it in the
                  proper position, he ascended, and with a beating heart tapped lightly upon the
                  window.</p>
               <p>Instantly the curtain was drawn aside, the window softly raised, and then Jack's
                  lips were pressed to those of the beautiful Mary.</p>
               <p>With a low exclamation of delight, the young girl assisted her convict lover into
                  her chamber; then, having drawn the curtain and closed the window, she threw
                  herself into our hero's arms, and fairly sobbed for joy.</p>
               <p>Mary's chamber was a perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bijou</foreign> of neatness
                  and comfort; and although luxury had no part in its arrangements, there prevailed
                  a quiet elegance which denoted a refined and womanly taste, while the voluptuous
                  bed, with its snowy drapery, would not have disgraced the sleeping apartment of
                  the "highest lady in the land."</p>
               <p>In one corner stood a table spread with all the essentials for an excellent
                  supper, together with a couple of bottles of wine, whose dusty appearance
                  indicated their ripe age. In the well-stocked cellar of old Wilson, these jovial
                  twins had slumbered for many years, until their sparkling contents had acquired
                  that delicious flavor which alone can render wine fit to be "the drink of the
                  gods."</p>
               <p>After a prolonged and passionate embrace, the lovers—for such we may now call
                  them—seated themselves upon the sofa; for Mary's apartment, unpretending as it
                  was, contained that very convenient and cosy article of furniture.</p>
               <p>As the happy girl sat with her graceful form encircled by the arms of our hero,
                  she surveyed him with looks of mingled curiosity and admiration.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" she murmured—"now that I can view thee without interruption, I find thee
                  even handsomer than I had supposed. 'Tis a bliss that I have long anticipated with
                  impatience; for I knew that thou wouldst escape from captivity. Some mysterious
                  but infallible instinct assured me of it."</p>
               <p>"Dear Mary, when you first saw me to-night, in the custody of my two guards, did
                  you have any hope that I should be able to elude their vigilance?"</p>
               <p>"I was so <emph>sure</emph> of it, that I made every preparation for thy
                  reception," answered the young girl, who, having been brought up in a Quaker
                  family, had acquired the peculiar dialect of the <emph>Friends,</emph> which
                  dialect she unconsciously used; and never did the Quakerish <emph>thee</emph> and
                     <emph>thou</emph> fall more musically from rosy lips.</p>
               <p>As Mary spoke, she pointed to the well-spread table; and gently urging her lover
                  towards it, placed a chair for him. Jack, nothing loth, seated himself, and began
                  to discuss, with a keen appetite, the excellent viands which proclaimed so
                  eloquently the superiority of mine host's larder. A year's subsistance on the
                  coarse diet of a prison, had well qualified Jack to enjoy such luxuries as cold
                  roast fowl, beef, ham, pickled oysters, delicate pastry, preserves, and a variety
                  of domestic and topical fruits.</p>
               <p>A few glasses of the generous wine soon elevated the spirits of the young Outlaw
                  to the highest degree of happiness. Mary also drank of the purple juice; but
                  sparingly, for <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Alas!" sighed Jack, as a sudden feeling of sorrow oppressed his heart—"after all,
                  dear Mary, this meeting, which seems so joyous, can be productive of nothing but
                  unhappiness to us both; and I almost regret having sought your sweet presence, for
                  this hour of bliss will but enhance the agony of our separation."</p>
               <p>"Heavens! why dost thou talk of separation?" demanded the enamoured young girl, in
                  affright—"are we not united forever?"</p>
               <p>"Would that it could be so! but 'tis impossible. Long before day-light I must be
                  on my way to a distant place; to linger in this vicinity, even although blest with
                  your sweet smiles, would be madness—for large rewards will be offered, and every
                  effort made, to effect my re-capture. I must not risk my liberty, which I have
                  gained with so much difficulty."</p>
               <p>"Yet we need not part—nay, I swear that we shall not; for I will be the companion
                  of thy flight, the sharer of thy hardships and thy dangers," cried the young girl,
                  with determination.</p>
               <p>Jack strained her closely to his breast as he exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Noble, generous girl, I will not basely take advantage of your heroic and
                  confiding nature, by consenting to so great a sacrifice on your part. Can I suffer
                  you to leave the comforts of a virtuous and happy home, in order that you may
                  become the sharer of my desperate fortunes? Never! I am an<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000046"/> Outlaw, but in spite of my many crimes, there yet
                  dwells within my breast a principle of honor; and, to prove its existence,"
                  continued Jack, as he arose from his seat—"I shall now take my instant departure
                  from this place, leaving your virgin purity unassailed; for 'twas to rob you of
                  that purity that I came here. Fair girl, adieu; you shall never become a sufferer
                  by a villainous act of mine!"</p>
               <p>As Jack (who spoke with the most perfect sincerity and truth,) advanced towards
                  the window for the purpose of leaving the chamber, the beautiful Mary threw her
                  arms around his neck to detain him, while, in the most impassioned accents she
                  said—</p>
               <p>"Thou shalt not go and thus deprive me of the society of the only being whom I
                  have ever loved. I must accompany thee, or die; thy refusal will force me to
                  commit the dreadful crime of suicide!"</p>
               <p>Jack shuddered, and pressed the infatuated girl closely to his throbbing heart.
                  She continued—</p>
               <p>"Think not that my love for thee is as the lightning's flash, which blazes for a
                  moment and is gone. 'Tis enduring as eternity itself. And imagine not that in
                  following thy fortunes, I shall forsake a happy home. The cruelty of my father has
                  long tempted me to deser this roof, which is to me naught but the abode of misery.
                  Let me accompany thee and cling to thee forever; and any sacrifice that thou mayst
                  require of me, for thy pleasure and gratification, shall be cheerfully
                  yielded."</p>
               <p>Who could have resisted the soft pleadings of that enamored girl, whose exciting
                  words were accompanied by glances the most passionate and caresses the most
                  voluptuous? Not our hero, who exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Be it so! Since you are determined, sweet girl, to quit the protection of your
                  tyrant father, we will sink or swim together. Come, dear Mary—let us devote one
                  little hour to love and then we'll start on our journey in search of happiness and
                  fortune."</p>
               <p>The youthful and criminal pair exchanged an impassioned glance, and the drapery of
                  the couch formed a curtain which will, for a brief season, shroud them both from
                  the gaze of the author and his readers.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE ROBBERY AND MURDER.</head>
               <p>An hour elapsed; an hour which, in the chamber of that unpretending roadside inn,
                  was perhaps fraught with joys as delirious and as sinful as any that ever
                  contaminated the holy season of Night, within the luxurious precincts of a ducal
                  palace.</p>
               <p>From the soft embraces of that now polluted couch issued the guilty pair; the
                  youth, with an expression of triumph gleaming in his splendidly wicked
                  countenance—the maid (<emph>that was</emph>) with the blush of shame upon her
                  cheek, yet with a subdued glance of gratified passion in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Come," cried our hero—' it will soon be daylight, and it is nigh time that we
                  were on the move. Let us start at once."</p>
               <p>"Stay a moment," said the girl, who, at her lover's suggestion, had now abandoned
                  the Quaker dialect, as being liable to lead to her detection. "Stay, until we have
                  put on our disguises."</p>
               <p>"Our disguises!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. I must now tell you that in anticipation of our flight, I have prepared
                  suitable costumes for us, in order that we may pass through the country without
                  exciting suspicion. The clothing is plain, but appropriate. Here it is."</p>
               <p>So saying the thoughtful Mary went to her bureau and took from thence two entire
                  suits of clothing which were, in truth, well adapted to the purpose in view. The
                  garments were plain but respectable; and, when arrayed in his suit, Jack looked
                  like a sober young country gentleman of the better class. His appearance might
                  have proclaimed him to be the son of some very wealthy farmer.</p>
               <p>The clothing of the girl was also of the masculine order. When duly arrayed, she
                  presented the aspect of a rustic but unusually handsome boy, whose careful mother
                  had neatly arrayed him for a visit to his relatives.</p>
               <p>Having finished dressing, the pair were about to take their departure through the
                  widow, when Jack suddenly paused, and seemed to be struck with an idea.</p>
               <p>"I am unfortunately out of funds," said he—"and in an emergency like the present,
                  when we are about to travel and incur many necessary expenses we should endeavor
                  to provide ourselves with the <emph>needful,</emph> at all risks—even if we are
                  obliged to rob our nearest relatives. What think you, dear Mary?"</p>
               <p>"I understand you," replied the young girl—"and approve of your suggestion; for my
                  father has no claims of duty upon me. He has considerable money in the house, and
                  I well know where he keeps it."</p>
               <p>"That is capital; such old rascals always know how to accumulate the dimes. But
                  pardon me for speaking thus of your——"</p>
               <p>"He is my father no longer; I have long ceased to regard him as such. There will
                  be considerable risk in securing the money; but I do not fear. I will go to his
                  chamber, while you remain here to await my return."</p>
               <p>"Nay, I will accompany you. Lead the way, and I will follow. In case of discovery,
                  I must be near to aid you; for otherwise, should the old devil chance to awaken,
                  he would murder you."</p>
               <p>"That is true," said the girl, with a shudder; and then, requesting her lover to
                  follow, she passed out of the chamber and stood in the passage way to listen.</p>
               <p>All being silent, save the welcome sound of a distant <emph>snore,</emph> which
                  was rendered in the deepest possible bass Mary noiselessly descended a flight of
                  stairs and paused before the door of a room from which, with increased volume
                  issued the nasal music.</p>
               <p>"Here is where my father sleeps," said the young girl to her lover.</p>
               <p>Jack tried the door and found that it was not locked.</p>
               <p>"Let us enter," whispered he—"the old man sleeps soundly. Should he awaken and
                  interfere with my proceedings, he shall <emph>sleep</emph> a deeper and longer
                  sleep than any he ever enjoyed before. Come!"</p>
               <p>"Surely," said Mary, in a low and agitated tone—"you would not commit
                     <emph>murder?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Our safety above everything else. Follow me!"</p>
               <p>They entered the chamber.</p>
               <p>A light was burning dimly upon the table. On a mean and uncurtained bed lay the
                  portly form of old Wilson the inn-keeper. His red, bloated face and carbuncled
                  nose, contrasted with the white pillows, looked like a huge coal of fire sizzling
                  in a bank of snow; and the music which that carbuncled nose discoursed, resembled
                  the reverberations of distant thunder. Close to the bed-side was a chair
                  supporting a bottle of liquor and a tumbler—affording evidence that the old man,
                  during his intervals of wakefulness throughout the night, was accustomed to
                  indulge in his favorite potations and thereby renew his intimacy with the drowsy
                  god.</p>
               <p>With old Wilson, his "ruling passion" seemed to be strong in sleep; for, with all
                  the characteristic pertinacity of a veteran rum-seller, he would occasionally
                  mutter—"Won't trust; liquor costs money; owe for two glass<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC8051-00000047"/> es already. Where's my daughter? D—n her, I'll beat
                  her to death; she won't wait on the customers——"</p>
               <p>And here a terrific snore would interrupt the muddy current of the old man's
                  alcoholic ideas.</p>
               <p>"Where does this wretch keep his money?" inquired our hero in accents of strong
                  disgust.</p>
               <p>"In a large chest beneath his bed; the keys are under his pillow."</p>
               <p>Jack cautiously thrust his hand under the pillow and drew forth a bunch of keys,
                  one of which he found fitted a large and somewhat heavy box that was placed
                  beneath the bed of the unconscious sleeper.</p>
               <p>This box having been softly drawn from its hiding place, our hero opened it, and
                  to his inexpressible delight, he found that it contained a sum money, in gold and
                  bank-notes, not far short of a thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>While hastily transferring the money to his pockets, he unfortunately dropped a
                  heavy purse of specie upon the floor, and the chinking metal created a
                  considerable noise.</p>
               <p>The young robber mutter a deep curse.</p>
               <p>The old man awoke.</p>
               <p>The girl uttered a piercing scream.</p>
               <p>"Murder! thieves! help! murder!" yelled the inn-keeper, whose dread of losing his
                  money, instantly overcame his fears of the robber; and, leaping out of bed, he
                  seized Jack by the throat.</p>
               <p>A terrific struggle ensued. Old Wilson was a portly, powerful man, but he was
                  scarcely a match for his young and vigorous antagonist, who also possessed a
                  considerable knowledge of pugilism. In a "rough and tumble" encounter of this
                  kind, however, brute strength perhaps tells to a far greater advantage than
                  pugilistic skill.</p>
               <p>The young girl, half frightened out of her senses, stood a horrified looker
                  on.</p>
               <p>Both the combatants fought for a great personal object:—the inn-keeper to preserve
                  his hoarded wealth, and the robber to secure his liberty.</p>
               <p>Having succeeded in laying old Wilson prostrate upon the floor, Jack was preparing
                  to follow up his advantage by throttling his adversary, when the latter suddenly
                  caught the thumb of our hero between his teeth, and bit it fairly off</p>
               <p>Maddened by the intense pain produced by this unexpected amputation, the young
                  robber seized the brandy bottle from the chair, and with it struck a most
                  tremendous blow upon the innkeepers head. The blow fractured the skull, and caused
                  the instant death of the unfortunate man.</p>
               <p>For a few minutes, the murderer contemplated the corpse of his victim with the
                  deepest feelings of horror; for he had not anticipated the perpetration of a crime
                  so black and so appalling.</p>
               <p>The daughter of the murdered man, on seeing the brains of her parent scattered
                  over the floor, fell senseless.</p>
               <p>Jack soon recovered from the state of stupefaction into which he had been thrown
                  by the consciousness of the awful crime which he had committed; for his soul had
                  become too familiar with the blackness of guilt, to admit of his being permanently
                  affected, even by such a bloody deed.</p>
               <p>"He brought it upon himself," muttered he—" curse him! the thumb of my right hand
                  is gone, and that mark will serve to point me out whenever a description is
                     <emph>given of my person.</emph> Besides, I shall never again be able to pick a
                  pocket with my accustomed grace and professional skill."</p>
               <p>Having stopped the effusion of blood, and dressed his mutilated hand as well as
                  possible, Jack secured all the murdered man's money about his person, and then
                  addressed himself to the task of restoring Mary Wilson to a state of
                  consciousness.</p>
               <p>This being effected, the young girl gazed at the corpse of her father, and
                  shuddered.</p>
               <p>"Gracious God! this is terrible!" she murmured, as she cast upon her criminal
                  lover a glance of fear.</p>
               <p>"Twas a deed of necessity. Come, it is time for us to take our departure."</p>
               <p>"But I cannot go while the remains of my father are——"</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, girl," interrupted Jack, sternly—"you must at once throw aside
                  these feelings of weakness, or we part now, and forever. My safety must not be
                  compromised by a foolish indulgence in unavailing regret. My criminal pursuits may
                  often demand the shedding of blood. If you cannot endure such sights, without
                  manifesting feelings of horror and fear, then you are no companion for me. I leave
                  this place at once; you can remain, if you choose."</p>
               <p>"I will go with you," said the young girl sadly—"I have advanced too far to
                  recede. Henceforth, I resign myself to a dark and ruinous fate, which seems
                  inevitable. Let us go."</p>
               <p>"Bravo, Moll! you are a girl after my own heart, after all. Your desperate frame
                  of mind well becomes the mistress of a bold Outlaw. Come, courage, dear girl! a
                  glorious career is before us. In some one of the cities of the West, we will lead
                  a life of pleasure and luxury that will shame the regal splendor of princes! Long
                  hours of voluptuous dalliance—the midnight feast—the masquerade—theopera—splendid
                  apparel—these and a thousand others are the delights which shall console us for
                  the hardships we may have to endure, the dangers we may encounter. These are the
                  celestial joys which shall efface from our memories the remembrance of every deed
                  of blood!"</p>
               <p>"Oh!" cried the young girl, completely carried away by the excitement produced by
                  the infernal eloquence of her criminal lover—"there is a dangerous, but delightful
                  and seductive fascination in your words which I cannot resist; and would not, if I
                  could! Take me where you please, do with me as you will; henceforth, I am yours,
                  body and soul. Command, and I will obey; I am your mistress, your adorer, your
                  slave!"</p>
               <p>And there, in that bloody chamber—the scene of robbery and murder—there, in the
                  ghastly presence of death, did that guilty pair seal the devilish compact of their
                  co-partnership in crime, by indulging in a long and delirious embrace; the
                  murderer, unawed by the presence of his victim's mangled remains—the girl,
                  unrestrained by the close proximity of her father's corpse!</p>
               <p>It was a scene such as devils would have delighted to contemplate—lust, robbery
                  and murder, all congregated together!</p>
               <p>And demons, in their dark and lurid home, must have celebrated with infernal
                  orgies and a diabolical festival, the terrible events of that Night of Crime! <q>

               <head type="sub">THE HIGH SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY.</head>
               <p>It was nearly day-light when the criminal pair issued from the road-side inn. The
                     <emph>sky was obscured</emph> by dark clouds, and a light but penetrating rain
                  was falling.</p>
               <p>"Curse the rain!" muttered Jack—" it will probably defeat my plan for removing all
                  traces of the crime. Although I have set fire to the house in several places. it
                  will never burn in this shower."</p>
               <p>On repairing to the spot where he had left the warden's horse and chaise, Jack
                  found all secure; and, congratulating himself on having such a convenient means of
                  conveyance, he<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8051-00000048"/> and the disguised young
                  gir entered the vehicle and drove rapidly towards Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>When they entered the city, it was broad day-light, and many people were abroad,
                  none of whom suspected that the two occupants of the chaise, who seemed to be a
                  comely, sedate looking young man and a handsome country boy, were in reality a
                  murderer and his mistress flying from the scene of a most terrible crime.</p>
               <p>Jack drove quickly through the streets and approached one of the huge bridges
                  which cross the Schuylkill. This bridge was the same one that had been the scene
                  of his daring exploit, when he leaped into the river in order to escape from his
                  pursuers—an adventure which, the reader will recollect, resulted in his being
                  re-captured.</p>
               <p>Having crossed the bridge, the gallant and faithful steed, under the guidance of
                  his new master, dashed at a spanking pace along the great turnpike road which
                  extends through the entire State of Pennsylvania to Pittsburg, and beyond that
                  city, to Ohio.</p>
               <p>At noon they stopped to take some refreshments at rather a stylish tavern, the
                  landlord of which happened to be the High Sheriff of that county. This gentleman
                  being blessed with rather more than the usual average amount of curiosity, was
                  very inquisitive; and, while the two travellers were at dinner, he began to
                  persecute them with all sorts of inquiries, as to who they were? where did they
                  come from? where going? what was their business? and a host of other questions
                  which many people would have considered not only as unnecessary, but also as
                  highly impertinent.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what, Mr. What's your-name, I am usually regarded as a very polite
                  person; but, if you persist in your cross-examination, I shall be reluctantly
                  compelled to insinute that my affairs are none of your d—d business."</p>
               <p>"But I am the High Sheriff of the county," said the landlord, pompously.</p>
               <p>"If you were the High Sheriff of Hell, you should not insert that ugly snout of
                  yours into any concern in my possession—except one. What is the reckoning?"</p>
               <p>The indignant Boniface having named the amount of his charges, it was paid,
                  although the bill was very extortionate.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, the horse which Jack had <emph>borrowed</emph> from the warden, had
                  been taken care of by the ostler. As our hero and his disguised mistress re-seated
                  themselves in the chaise, Boniface stood in the tavern porch and surveyed the
                  horse with a keen gaze and somewhat of an astonished air.</p>
               <p>"By Jupiter!" he suddenly exclaimed—"if that horse ain't the property of Mr. Fox,
                  warden of the Eastern Penitentiary, I'll give my head for a football! Why, Fox has
                  put up at this tavern hundreds of times, and I know the animal as well as I know
                  my own nose!"</p>
               <p>The worthy landlord's acquaintance with his own nose reflected but little credit
                  upon him as a gentleman of respectability and moral uprightness, inasmuch as the
                  said nose was of a dissolute, not to say rummy appearance; in fact, it was what
                  might be termed a dissipated nose, notwithstanding that it was the property of the
                  "High Sheriff of the county!"</p>
               <p>"Young men," continued the landlord—" how came you in possession of Mr. Fox's
                  horse?"</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken; the animal belongs to me," said Jack, disdainfully.</p>
               <p>The ostler here spoke up, and corroborated the statement of his master; asserting,
                  with many oaths, that the horse <emph>was</emph> the property of Mr. Fox, and had
                  been for years.</p>
               <p>A crowd, attracted by this altercation, here began to gather around the
                  disputants; and Jack, fearful of being detained or arrested on suspicion suddenly
                  denly started the animal into a swift gallop, leaving Boniface and his auditors to
                  make their own comments and form their own opinions.</p>
               <p>This incident left a very disagreeable impression on the mind of our hero, for he
                  feared that the landlord's recognition of the warden's house might furnish a clue
                  to the latter gentleman in regard to the direction taken by the escaped prisoner;
                  and then to this escaped prisoner might be traced the robbery and murder of old
                  Wilson.</p>
               <p>With this view of the case, Jack resolved to part with the horse, and change the
                  disguises of himself and companion, as soon as possible.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE HIGHWAY ROBBERY.</head>
               <p>The afternoon was declining into evening. The rain had ceased, and the last rays
                  of the setting sun faintly gilded with the hues of crimson and gold, the fleecy
                  clouds that floated in the western horizon.</p>
               <p>Jack Harold and his mistress, seated in the chaise, were proceeding leisurely
                  along in a most lonely part of the road, hoping soon to arrive at some tavern or
                  farmhouse which would afford them accommodations for the night.</p>
               <p>On gaining the summit of an elevation of considerable height, our travellers were
                  enabled to command a view of the surrounding country for miles around; and not a
                  single house was visible.</p>
               <p>"What a desolate spot!" exclaimed our hero—"and how suitable for a deed of robbery
                  and crime! Dick Turpin, mounted on his 'bonnie Black Bess,' would have selected
                  this spot, above all others, to be the scene of one of his daring and romantic
                  exploits. Ah! those were the good old days in England, when highwaymen thrived,
                  and were regarded as heroes, instead of criminals!"</p>
               <p>Mary was about to reply, when the noise of approaching wheels was heard, and soon
                  a carriage, drawn by two fine horses, emerged from a small wood which bordered the
                  road, a short distance ahead.</p>
               <p>"By heavens!" cried Jack—"here is an opportunity to open the campaign. I shall
                  stop that coach, and rob its inmates!"</p>
               <p>"But if there should be a number of persons, you will be overpowered," said the
                  young girl, as a shade of anxiety crossed her pretty countenance; and this anxiety
                  arose more on her lover's account, than her own.</p>
               <p>"If the coach contains a dozen men I am determined to make the attempt," was the
                  careless reply of the bold young Outlaw, in whose eyes danger of any kind
                  possessed a peculiar degree of fascination.</p>
               <p>The girl replied not, but gazed upon her lover with a look which indicated the
                  extent of her admiration and the profound depth of her passion for him.</p>
               <p>When the coach had approached to within a short distance, Jack stopped his horse
                  in the middle of the road, and then leaped from the chaise, followed by his
                  paramour.</p>
               <p>It was now nearly dark, and every object was enveloped in obscurity.</p>
               <p>The coachman, being one half asleep and the other half drunk, had not observed the
                  approach of the chaise; and he was suddenly aroused from his drowsy condition, by
                  the rearing and plunging of his horses, caused by Jack's powerful grasp upon the
                  reins.</p>
               <p>"Hullo, what the devil's this?"—growled Jehu, who was a fat, lubberly fellow; and,
                  not immediately perceiving the cause of the difficulty, he began to ply his whip
                  with all the activity of which such a corpulent and lazy subject was capable.</p>
               <p>At this moment the window of the carriage was thrust open, a head looked<pb
                     n="100" xml:id="VAC8051-00000049"/> forth, and a voice exclaimed, in tones of
                  extreme impatience and irritation—</p>
               <p>"What <emph>is</emph> the trouble, Dobson? Do get on, for heaven's sake; for I
                  must be in Philadelphia to-night, on the most important business."</p>
               <p>Jack started with surprise; for it seemed to him that the voice of the traveller
                  in the coach sounded strangely familiar.</p>
               <p>"Please yer Excellency," replied the bewildered coachman—"some person is at the
                  horses' heads, and I'm afraid that we're beset by robbers. Oh, dear—oh, dear! I
                  shall be murdered, as sure as my name's Toby Dobson!"</p>
               <p>By this time the horses had become perfectly quiet, and poor Dobson was too much
                  frightened to attempt to urge them forward.</p>
               <p>"Rascal!" cried the gentleman in the coach—"who do you think would have the
                  presumption to rob <emph>me,</emph> the Governor of the Commonwealth? You are
                  drunk, sir, and have mistaken the finger-post for a foot-pad. Be careful, or I'll
                  discharge you. Drive on!"</p>
               <p>But it so happened that the coachman <emph>couldn't</emph> drive on, for the very
                  excellent reason that he was sprawling in the midst of the road, having been
                  dragged from the coach-box by Jack, who quieted him by the assurance that if he
                  made the least noise he should be murdered on the spot.</p>
               <p>While the disguised young girl attended to the horses, in order to keep them
                  quiet—a task of which she was perfectly capable, being an inn-keeper's
                  daughter—our hero presented himself at the window of the coach, and thus addressed
                  the traveller, who was really the Governor of the State:—</p>
               <p>"Your Excellency, my name is Jack Harold. You may possibly remember that upon one
                  occasion, when you paid a visit to the Eastern Penitentiary, you found me an
                  inmate of one of the cells, sentenced for life. Your Excellency saw fit to address
                  me in the language of insult, and I then ventured to assure you that we should
                  meet again, under the free sky of heaven, when I should have <emph>just five short
                     words</emph> to say to you. That time has come; and those five words are
                  these—'YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE!'"</p>
               <p>Vain would it be to attempt a description of the Governor's fright; he was alone
                  in the carriage, and well knew that he could not depend for assistance upon
                  Dobson, the coachman Besides, he knew not but that the young highwayman was
                  desperately armed, and attended by a dozen or twenty other robbers.</p>
               <p>Therefore, with a heavy heart and a deep groan of anguish, His Excellency produced
                  and handed over a pocketbook apparently well lined, and what seemed to be a
                  valuable gold watch.</p>
               <p>Having cut the horses' traces, in order to prevent an immediate pursuit, Jack bade
                  the Governor an affectionate good night, and then, followed by his mistress,
                  leaped into the chaise.</p>
               <p>Away sped the guilty lovers, at almost lightning speed, along the now moon-lighted
                  road; for, by this time, bright Luna had begun her celestial journey, shedding a
                  radiance as brilliant and as pure as that upon which fair Juliet gazed, when first
                  she linked the thought of that soft light with Love and Romeo!</p>

               <p>We must now bid the reader a temporary adieu; but, should he feel an interest in
                  the fortunes of our various characters, and in the <emph>final end</emph> of our
                  crime-stained hero, he will perhaps accompany us through the concluding Tale of
