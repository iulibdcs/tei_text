"BLESS me, how provokingl" ejaculated im- patient Lucy Greenwood, her blue eyes peer- ing anxiously away in the dim distance. "Patience, lady fair; see, the long desired rounds the point off yonder--five minutes more, and this suspense will be ended," replied her gallant, hand- some Ernest Elwood. A pleased smile lighted up the little girl's spark- ling eyes, and her silk skirt became inflated through the rapidity of her shuffling little feet that did infinite credit to .the instructions of some "Master of Ceremonies." "The ' Percival,' as I live!" exclaimed Edith Elwood, another of the waiting group, ad the steam- er neared the wharf, and sent up a volume of black smoke from its iron lungs, accompanied by a shrill scream that would have curdled the blood of a unsophisticated hearer.

"Yes ; I never 'look upon the wine when it is red,' but my ears suffer for the indulgence," respond- ed the young man with an appearance of pain upon his handsome face, as though- his auricles were then enduring compression! I heard; I saw it all, as I drew my sable furs around my insignificant shoulders, and leaned back in an obscure corner of the waiting 'Buss.' - I was the poor cousin of the queenly Edith, and con- sequently she was my escort upon the present occa- -sion, and in fact upon almost every occasion that drew me into the  gay world- with my beautiful and wealthy relative. - She zuas beautiful, so far as large, liquid, heaven- ly blue eyes,- cream and roseleaf Cheeks, luscious- cherry lips and elaborate ringlets of purple'black- ness could constitute beauty. I loved, to sit and gaze upon her faultless face, unobserved, and half sighed as I beheld my own features reflected in the mammoth mirrors, in perfect contfest to those of my brillianthelle cousin's. I longed for one ninetiethl part of the love that was lavished upon her, and- secretly bemoaned Nature's niggardness in fashion- ing-my dark, diminutive face. But I' was not really unhappy. My cousin was warm-hearted-and kind, though capricious and woqiettish; and: by constant services rendered, for her amusement and benefit, I. lwas not wholly comfortless, though my / dependent position galled my proud spirit.    &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8303-00000005"/> 8  -   THE STRANGER'S STRATAGEM  I had never known a mothers love ; she died in giving me birth, and i father's last blessing was breathed upon my head ere I could realize the ex- tent of my irreparable loss. Theirs was an ill-starred union- in opposition to the wil of my maternal grandfather, from pecuniary considerations-and my proud relative could never quite forgive. me for bearing the name and carry- ing in my slender arteries the plebeian blood of my "poor preacher" parent. . For my own part, I gloried in my blood and cog- o nomen, but secretly, for fear of a reprimand and stern command to abdicate my comfortable :quarters close beside my uncle's 'old arm chair.' I loved him. He was the only white being in the wide world that I did love, then. My aunt was not positively 4hrsh and unfeeling, but she evidently regarded me as an interloper. I had none of her blood in my veins, but my uncle's was mingled with the " poor preacher's" there, and I loved him for my dead mother's sake, with all the ardor -that a- little lone child can Cherish for an only object. He was kind, but undemonstrative-distributed his gifts equally between:his two children and my- self -and no one -had ever detected a symptom of partiality or distinction exhibited towards the three juvenile creatures of his care. He was an indolent, indulgent, but ambitious man, who contented him- self with simply defraying the expenses of his children's education, and handing them over un- reservedly, to his wife and their instructors.

My cousins were both the counterpart of -their mother, in mind and in person, and my aunt's whole : life was centered in her beautiful offspring. She was not devotedly attached to her husband, and I secretly thought she essayed to estrange her children from him, that their entire hearts might be bestow- ed upon her I She was jealous as a turbaned Turk, and this canker of the mind was manifested even with reference to her children's love? Me she evidently regarded as an object of charity, and her quiet patronising care and favors made me continually feel my humiliating. position. I could not have defined the distinction she formed between me and my cousins; the difference was not obvious to one uninterested; I could only feel, in my soul, that a line of demarkation did exist. I knew I was not loved, though I shared, apparently, her care and solicitude for my cousin Edith.

My cousin Ernest was a bright, bold and beautiful boy, good hearted but wayward as his sister, who snubbed ipe in his moments of ill-nature, and play- fully pelted me with candies and nuts, when his fits of passion had subsided, to compensate for his past indignity. He treated me as an amusing playthilg, because of my doll-like size-would shonlder me in hisfrolicsome moods, for a gallop around the wide green garden, and be not over scrupulous of setting me down as softly as would better have suited my physical comfort.

I had but one friend at these times of peril and playful persecution,-an old- grey-haired servant of my maternal grandsire, whose long and faithful services had been rewarded by emancipation, in the last will and testament of his aged master. Uncle Will, who had been consigned to the care and support of my mother's brother, during his life, occupied a small shed upon' the premises, and thither I repaired upon every occasion that requir- ed comfort and condolence. Uncle Will was "a-, friend in need," and consequently " a friend indeed." The affection he had cherished for my mother was transferred to her child, althougll he'sorrowfuilly in- :formed me I wasn't :' one mite- like 'ergl " and that I " 'sembled my farder jest as much as .two peas." Uncle Will had-professed conversion under my father's ministry, and revered his memory as much  as he loved my lost mother for her beauty and gentleness of soul. I knew she was beautiful; the only ornament I  possessed in the world convinced me of that fact. It was a little gold locket, attached to a delicate chain of the most exquisite-workmanship, that was clasped by a heart and hand -tat bore my'mother's initials, and my own, "al .

I was graciously permitted to attend school with my cousin Edith, and I labored early and late to improve the advantages vouchsafed me. I possessed a thinking; calculating mind.- My isolated child- hood had thrown me upon my inner life for amuse- ment and companionship; I spent all the day and half the night listening to an invisible something away in the memory of-my immaterial being, singing sweet wild fancies, that were perpetuated in after years. I had a secret motive in such unremitting labor. When fully competent, I designed to' leave my splendid, but icy home, and render my mental accomplishments subservient to my longing for free- dom and independlence. We had attained our seventeenth year, and were upon the eve of departing for a distant Seminary, for an absence of twelve months-the finishing of our scholastic course. Edith was four months my senior, and three years the junior of her brother Ernest, who would receive his diploma in one more year, at Randolph Macon College. "Mabel shall share equally with my daughter, in educational advantages. She is my only sister's child, and shall have the benefit of my patrimony, so far as mental culture. Let that end the discussion." Reader, I had stopped inadvertently at their cham- ber door, as I caught my name uttered by-my uncle,   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     15 in an unusually firm and high tone. I could not have moved an inch, in some seconds, had the ghost of Samuel, or any other "spook," risen up before me. I was rooted to the spot. My heart almost stopped its pulsations a moment; the next it beat one hun- dred to a minute, and a blindness camne over my eyes as I stumbled into my own chamber, and dropped down upon the hearth-rug. I was exceedingly sensitive, and of a most nerv- ous temperament. I trembled from head to foot, and my hands grew cold as the marble statues in uncle's garden, as I sat there and tried to calm my excited nature. It was the first insight I had ever had into my aunt's character. I had always known she did not love me, but I did not know or suspect that her in- difference amounted to such entire heartlessness- that shegrudged me the little from her heavy coffers, that my uncle expended for my education. I half resolved to decline accompanying mvy cousin Edith, and enter at once upon the course that I had mentally marked out for my future; 3 could com- plete my education, with the fruit of my own exer- tions, and thus relieve my penurious aunt of an in- tolerable burden. I could not compose my shattered nerves until I had confided this new-found, overwhelming trouble, to my sympathizing sable friend; and noir; as upon all previous occasions of distress, I posted off to un- cle Will.

In his warm sympathy and solicitude, the old negro patted my cranium caressingly, as in the days of my childhood, as lie leaned upon his hickory staff, and looked down upon my sad -face, with his age- dimmed and mournfully compassionate eyes. I took- uncle Will's advice, and kept the secret of my aunt's cupidity and heartlessness from all others.   Y  CHAPTER II. Is it the sound of days that are no more?--Ossia. I WONDERED what he was thinking about, with those great blue eyes, so like my angel mother's riveted upon the red coals in the glowing grate. All was silent in that luxurious apartment. The costly and glittering decorations seemed to mock the melancholy stillness and gloom that hung over the three occupants. My aunt sat in the opposite corner, poring over the "Mysteries of Paris," and Edith's chair was ten- antless; the beautiful heiress was surrounded by her admirers in the drawing-room. t watched him surreptitiously, as I sat close by his side, till unconsciously my French exercise gra- vitated slowly to my lap, and-my own thoughts ran wild through the ruddy fire-flame that flickered over the anthracite. There was thick shade upon that full, massive brow, and deep sadness in those introverted azure eyes. I- wondered if he were not living over again his boyhood time, dreaming of the sweet eves " long, long ago," when three, who now lay in the silent grave, clustered around that old homestead-hearth, tlnd life was all sunshine and promise before him.

There were large portraits in the drawing-room of my grand-parents and uncles, painted by the cel- ebrated American artist, George Healy; my own mother's had once hung there, but was removed and consigned to the flames by a vindictive father, after her marriage with a "poor preacher." I saw the stern, cold face of my unrelenting grandsire, looking through a grave-like mound in the glowing grate, as I mused on and on. It looked gloomy and remorse- , ful, and a seeming of acute pain furrowed the white, aged brow. The hallucination was so vivid arid distinct, that my heart beat faster as I gazed. I wondered if he saw it, too, and what effect did it produce. I leaned softly, very quietly back, in order to observe his face without attracting attention, and turned my face very slowly and cautiously towards him. I had expected to see those blue eyes riveted upon the red coals, in wonder and half fear, and that manly face white with emotion. My superstitious mind had invested him, for the moment, with like weakness and-perceptions. I met: those blue eyes full, as I slyly lifted mine towards them; they were very sad, still, but a soft. ness, a soul-kindness, beamed out of them into mine, that shot down to my heart, and effectually unhing ed mnimental mechanism. a    OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     19 He smiled benignantly as he witnessed my star- tfled and nervous expression, and laid his hand affect' ionately upon my head, as he had never before ca- ressed me.                $ "A penny for your thoulghts, Bell; I've been studying your face for at least ten minutes, and have seen it vary as many times, T'll declare!

You're sorry, too, not a little bit, but a ' big heap', as the little darkies say--I see it all about your tiny mouth, that looks like a piece offlint, by Jupiter!-What's the matter, Bell?-hate to go away and leave uncle, eh?" I lost sight of my aunt and every thing extrane- ous, as I heard that dear kind voice, and felt thati father-like hand laid tenderly upon my orphan head, and acted solely from impulse. I sprang upon his knee, clasped my arms around his neck and kissed- him many times in quick succession, with more pas.- sion than I had ever displayed in my life before.- He was evidently surprised, though he -put his arms around me and drew me closely up to his broad-. breast, as he pressed his lips warmly and lingeringly to mine.

I swallowed down a mighty sob, and raised my head. "I was sad because I was all alone in the world. I have no father and mother to care for me. I am poor, and dependent upon you for my education, but I will teach and -support myself, when I am qualified. I am poor and plain, and nobody loves me, I thought, and I had rather not live than not be loved by you, uncle. I know you have fed and clothed me seven- teen years, but my heart has been freezing and starv- ing. Nobody ever said they loved me, but uncle Will.! Don't you love me, uncle?" I could scarcely breathe, he held me so tightly. A strange pallor had settled around his closely compressed lips, and two large tears had melted into a clear stream along the lower lids, that only needed a slight motion of those lids to shake them over the black lashes upon the white cheeks be- neath.  HeI dropped his face upon mine and those tears wet my forehead. I cried more heartily than ever. "I love you, Bell, my darling, as my own child, and as such I regard you. Half of your mother's wealth was bequeathed to me, and you have a right to what you have received. You shall never teach, while I live, so put that out of your head, notw. Good Lord I what a soul you have, and I thought you were as cold and hard as granite, and cared no more for your uncle than the man in the moon!"   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     21 He turned upon my aunt a glance the signifi- cance of which I could not then comprehend. The motion reminded me of her presence, and I shrunk instinctively as I met her eyes. They were  calm, but very cold-cold as ice, in their expression, and her face was white as my uncle's. I trembled and my arms tightened involuntarily around his neck, as I looked. He gave me a glance, at the act, and I saw that my inner life was no longer veiled from his awakened perceptions. My aunt laid aside her book, and spoke very soft- Aly and composedly, while her eyes glittered with jealous rage. "Nature must have designed you for the stage, -1iss Hastings, you act so well and so naturally. You assume that no one loves you, when from your infancy I  have performed, by you, the part of a mother. Your ingratitude is unparalleled. Have I not cared for you, even as my   own daughter? What charges can you prefer against me for neglect and unkindness?" "I make none, aunt, and I am not certainly un- grateful." "Then why this fine acting, and these sly insinu- ations? You say no one loves you, when all the care you have received during your past life, proves the assertion a  falsehood. What secret design does this theatrical scene cover?" Her fierce eye and) sarcastic tone stirred up all my inherent pride.

I know you have cared for my physical wants and comfort, but I never felt that you loved me. I knew you were only giving in chllarity what you bestowed upon me. I have laid my arms, many a time, around your neck, hoping to have the yearnings of my orphan heart satisfied by one symptom of affection, but you put them gently but carelessly away. Love, aunt, speaks to the heart, without words or deeds, while the want of it will be felt even though actions would indicate its existence.

" You possess the faculty of speech in an eminent degee, Miss Hastings, and after your past dullness and taciturnity, I am surprised to find your volu- i ,-'bility equal to your impudence.

I was quietly rising to go to and essay to conciliate her, when my uncle drew me firmly back, and held ;: me securely in his folded arms, as he said, calmly but decisively  "I wish to talk with'lMabel; you can retire if the scene is offensive." She went quickly, with a storm of passion fulmi- hating in her cold glittingng eves. My heart grew. heavy within me, for I saw I had provoked an im- placable enemy;  We satthere a long time, and I learned more of my uncle's kind- .and loving nature than I had de- tested in seveenteen years. He told me about my mother-of their early affection, and her unfortu- nate marriage that separated her from her proud relatives, and cautioned me against forming so im- prudent an attachment. My heart sank like lead at this well meant advice, for, reader, I had, long ago, formed a strange attachment, and was then the betrothed wife of one whom I had never met, and of whose circumstances and social position I was utterly ignorant!  I struggled to. tell him all-to make g frank and full confession of what I had so long and carefully concealed from even my confidant, uncle Will, but my spirit failed me. I feared .the frown and stern rebuke, now that I new his feelings for, and inten- tions oncerning me .

I had never seen him--and my uncle Edward designed to bestow my mother's portion of his property upon her orphan child. Conscience stung me, like a serpent's tooth, for my duplicity as I listened; but dread of losing the love I had so lately found, held me in bands of iron. I resolved to trust to time for strength to make the revelation, and defer the evil day as long as possible. My betrothed was then in Europe, and, would not, return until- my school-days were ended, when he would appear to claim the. hand I had pledged him under such wildly romantic cir- cumstances.  .     .    CHAPTER III. ALONE in my chamber, after the first "good- night" kiss I had ever received from my moth- er's brother, I took from my travelling trunk, ready packed for to-morrow's journey, the daguerreotype of one whom I had never met, but in whose last letter Lhad read the words, italicised, with two ex- clamation points following, "Mabel, my wife!/" as applied to me! How my heart bounded and my hand shook as I read those words, and how cold I grew after it I Would he love me when we met? I asked myself. No one loved me that knew me personally, but poor ignorant uncle Will; would not he change when his ideal stood before him in propria persona? I grew cold with dread, for iso- lated as I was from all the world, with a heart yearning for affection, I had been easily impressed by his words of admiration and love, and a view of his noble, manly nature, as displayed through *the medium of two years' correspondence. But how was this affected? Sydney Sutherland was hundreds of miles away, and I was an-obscure, plain and penniless orphan of a "poor preacher." Reader, I was a Poet, unknown to all the world 2      -(26)  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8303-00000014"/> 26    THE STRANGER'S STRATAGEM ; but him, to whom my effusions were transmitted. The loneliness of my heart found relief in poetry; and waifs of Passion, Love, and Despair, went out overthe land, from the deep solitude and gloom of my spirit life. My writings were extensively cop- ied, and I soon found myself growing famous behind the shelter of a friendly'4i4om lek plume, without daring to enjoy publicly the benefit of such uii- looked-for celebrity. I had the satisfaction of hearing myself eulogized, and, abused, according to the antipodal tastes of individuals, without being -for a moment suspected ask the author of so -much discussion and curios- ity-  :  My cousin Ernest was one of my most ardent admirers, and posted a letter of inquiry to tile editor of the journal to which I contributed, con- cerning me. I was aware of his design, and foiled him in his effort. Ernest anathematized the editor for declining to make the disclosure. How he would have stood aghast, had he known the author of his indignant outhurst was his little insignificant "poor cousin!   .\  My. cousin Edith curled her luscious crimson lip, that :a honey-bee would have lit upon, in a flower- bed, for a rosebud, through mistake!-with the slightest- bit of scorn, as she heard my praise: she had her mother's nature, and was jealous, even of a - stranger!  I grew less sad than formerly--I had found a new world, new" hopes, new aspirations. I wrote on i ,v   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     27 and on, and guarded the secret even from uncle Will.  Six months from my dAbut in-the literary arena, I received a communication from Sydney Suther- land, enclosed and directed by my editor. tHe had resorted to this method, in order to effect an epis- tolary acquaintance.' I had long known him as a writer of high merit and considerable renown in the literary world. My pride was gratified by this event, but prudence held me in long deliberation. Would it be proper to comply with his wish, and enter into a private correspondence? I was young --not yet fifteen. I had no friend to whom I could apply for. counsel. No one lived, on whose affec- tion and solicitude for my welfare I could suffi- ciently rely, to confide to them even the secret of my authorship. I obeyed the promptings of incli- nation, and granted his desire. I eluded detection, by resorting to woman's wit in obtaining his com- munications from the P..O., though I mrny times escaped as by a: miracle! I learned, tfrn, that du. plicity is a constant trouble! Uncle Will wasmy agent-his ignorance and affection :/- shield. I  liked Mr. Sutherland more and more, until I finally committed the absurdity of " falling in love" with one I  never saw, only through the instrumen- tality of Dagueree, and in two yeara from the recep- tion of his- introductory letter, we were betrothed! I  hesitated to enter into an engagement until itf could be made -verbally, but my objections were overruled.

He relied implicitly upon my truth and faithfulness, and should rest content, during his long absence, with my simple promise of, marriage on his return. I loved him: he was the only one on earth, of my own race, that loved me, and-I promised I My relatives would, doubtless, rejoice to be re- lieved of such an incumbrance, and I consulted my own feeling without revealing to them my posi- tion. - We exchanged miniatures, rings'and tresses, and he embarked in the steamerfor Liverpool-- and with him went all the cheerfulness and hope I had enjoyed since my yearning heart first found a resting-place in his own. Again I felt all alone in the world; the *ide ocean rolled between us; per- haps its green waters would flow on forever, and sunder us as widely! One year had passed away-it had not cooled the long-ago warmth of my heart for the distant 'wanderer. But-now I'had found another love, and I grew cold with fear lest my engagement should incense my uncle. I was "in a strait' betwixt two.    CHAPTER    IV. I LOOKED down upon'the pledge-ring upon my finger--beneath were the initials "S. S." and- with my elbow upon the trunk-lid, I rested my lips upon the golden circlet, while I contemplated the likeness of my absent lover. He was not handsome-I was glad of that-but noble in person, and interesting in countenance. The hair was jet black and curly, and lay in thick masses upon the full temples. The forehead was very broad and high; I  would not' have pledged him my hand, had it not been--Ihad studied Spurzt heim's Phrenology, and subscribed heartily to his doctrine; my own observation had convinced me of its validity.

I made the configuration of her head the test of his science, and not in one instance did its developments refute his argument!

He was not erratic in temperament, I thought, and possessed a tendency to metaphysics and profound research. Thus far 1his appearance pleased me perfectly. I was unable to decide upon the precise color of his -eyes; they were not black nor blue-either a dark'grey, or light hazel. They were large and full, betokening fluency of speech. I knew he was an orator, at heart-his letters were rainbows of poetic beauty, studded with star gems of sense and reason. The face was oval in" contour, and wholly destitute of the fashionable appurtenance of the present day. It looked young, but manly. The mouth-was finely cut, with a slight indentation in either corner, the effect of a seemingly irresistible smile. The mouth was, to me, the only objectionable feature, i had strange notions for a girl of seventeen. My cousin Edith would hav'e ridiculed me for object- ing to that soft, unconscious smile; but I did regret its existence. A grave, even stern compression of those lips, indicating energy and indomitable will, would far better have suited my odd fancy; but I made the circumstances under which he sat, an- apology for' the light, half-quizzical expression abouf that softened mouth. I knew he possessed energy and strength of character, despite that effeminate seem- ing. I contrasted it withl my own, and they sug- gested June and mid-winter: Mine was emphati- cally like " patience on a monument." I wondered how he could insist upon an engagement, after be- holding my plain, sunless semblance, and w[th his kiiowledge, too, of my position in my uncle's faily, ,- .{   v%, l; s DOUBLE DECEIT.    31 for I had told him all. I had never received an in- timation of his circumstances, though I was unavoid- ably led to suppose him an aspiring artist. I only knew he possessed a high soul, and independent spirit, whatever might be his social position and pe- cuniary condition. I breathed a sigh of regret over the manly shade; not tha;t'I loved. him less, but the thought of my am- bitious uncle filled me with vague sensations of dis- coritent and dread. Had he bedn thus kind,.years ago, I had not thus sighed. over my duplicity. . But there was no recanting now, and whatever was Syd- ney Sutherland's station, I would fulfil my engage- ment, though it subjected me to the fate of my own poor mother. Twelve months subsequent to. that night I was again the lonely occupant of that chamber, in that precise position, and -filled with such gloomy fore- bodings of my uncle's wrath. I longed to m ake a revelation,-but my soul still faltered at the thought Like St. Paul, I had " finished my course," for my school days'were all ended. They had been 1alm, but notjoyous.

Mary Lane, my room-mate, was a congenial spir- it. -We talked little and studied much. She was evidently as ambitious of excelling, as myself, and I think as sincere a friendship spranga up between us as could exist between two whose inner lives were not revealed in words. I only knew that she de- signed teaching after the expiration of her scholastic term. I parted with her more sorrowfully than I had ever said farewell to one of my own sex. Years after, she married a wealthy and worthy man-one capable of appreciating her mental love- liness. She was not handsome, but gifted and good. Mary Lane's beauty was that which outlives the years. Miss Greenwood's brother was a college chum of my cousin Ernest, and two months after our return home, they fulfilled their promise of visiting my cousins. Charles' Greenwood was strikingly handsome, and I soon discovered that Edith's beauty had cap- tivated hisyoung fancy, while Ernest was equally enamored of the fair Lucy, and I foresaw a duplicate union of the two aristocratic houses, at no distant day. To the two visitors, I was a mere stranger. They looked down upon me as only the "poor cous- in," and considered it beneath their dignity and sta- tion to notice one so low, Charles was handsome, but his beauty was of an r 1r *   'OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.    33 effeminate order-soft, and destitute of strength and self-reliance. Adversity would have driven him to degradation; he could not have borne up manfully, beneath a burden -that required energy to shake off. Lucy was a greenhouse plant, that a -breath of winter air would have chilled and blighted. We were going to Edith's maternal aunt's, at the time our story opens, to attend the grand celebra- tion of her cousin Ellen's seventeenth natal day. A brilliant - ball was to usher her into society as a "finished young lady," and Edith and Lucy were on the qui vive for the excitement. Reader, I was a preacher's daughter, with a soul widely at variance with such scenes. and was not going from any desire of my own, but to gratify my uncle, who privately insisted upon my accompanying my cousins; for, as a member of his family, I had been included in the general invitation. My aunt and Edith gravely heard my assent, and looked surprised at the decision ; they were not aware that my uncle was the prime mover in the matter. I saw a sly smile exchanged between them, evidently at thoughts of the fine figure I would undoubtedly cut in that brilliant assembly. It did not affect my feelings, for I was inured to such silent significance, from them, with reference to my uncomely visage. I was puzzled by Edith's repugnance to the "Percival " on that occasion. True, she had advo- cated the cause of temperance pretty-eloquently for the last two months, but her abhorrence for wine I had never seen so fully evidenced as now. Soon 2*  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8303-00000018"/> 34    THE STRANGERS STRATAGEM; after our return from the seminary, we attended a temnperance lecture-the speaker had located him? self in town during our absence. Mortimer MAan- ley, Esq., the orator, was a nan of rare powers, of burning eloquence, and his denunciations of the "ruby woe," on that- occasion, had d6ubtless struck conviction to the heart of my beautiful cousin. He had been an occasional' visitor at my uncle's since that time ;-Edith' beauty and wit were powerful attractions to the-" lords of creation." To me he was yet a; stranger, I had never met him in the social circle : I was not considered a parlor orna- ment, and rarely appeared there from inclination. My autnt and cousin were satisfied with my disposi- tion for'retirement, though my uncle opposed and ridiculed my predilection, and sometimes pushed nie into society mightily against my will. I saw his motives were an advantageous marriage, and shrank from the conviction, for I was already wed- ded in heart to Sydney Sutherland, even had I the power of winning another; I wished to :remain in seclusion until he came to astound my relatives with an expos6 of our position. Mr. Manley passed quickly, and stepped into the waiting boat, as Ernest uttered his reply to Lucy's -badinage. I saw Edith color: as she beheld him, and screen her face. Ernest observedhim also. "Now, there goes the- great Temperance Lecturer, sig i--if he can patronize the bar-keeping boat, you can. -No excuse for your- obstinacy now. We shall lose an hour by such nonsense-come along, I say!"   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     35, Ernest sprang out of the omnibus, and drew Lacy gently after him, grimacing at- Edith, as he went. Charles clasped her hand, -and lifted her tenderly out. She made a feint of resistance-for I saw it was only a feint. She went gladly. I followed without assistance; no one feared for my neck .or delicacy. I was no heiress, and could "help myself."        .  My curiosity was wide awake, and I watched them closely. Was that gay and volatile girl cap- tured by a poor lawyer? Mr. Manley was only a poor lawyer, but his talents and superior powers compensated for a deficiency in wealth, evidently. He was universally courted and admired. But he- was only a poor lawyer, and my proud uncle would never sanction their union, I felt confident. I fore- saw Edith destined to trouble if she really loved hi-m. A group of gentlemen stood around the entrance- way-among them was Mr. Manley. . I saw Edith's face turn towards him. He was not looking at her; his eyes were bent towards the black waters. I had never been so near. him, before. .He looked strangely interesting. I forgot, to " consider my ways" and stepped ,upon my travelling skirt, as I went up the slight ascent. I stumbled and fancied myself going down into the waters, at the boat's side.

I was blind, for a mo- ment, -by the propelling power that launched me for- ward ;-when my vision cleared, I found myself in the arms of Mortimer Manley! He had sprung for- ward; and arrested my fall. I disengaged myself and looked up in his eyes as I stammered-some words of thanks. Reader, I did not look long-why, I could not tell then, nor there- after. He smiled as I met his eye, and that smile startled something away down in my soul, that had never been agitated before. My heart felt as though under the influence of a galvanic battery ; its wild throbs shook my entire frame. It might have been the effect of the fall, but I dated my in- constancy to Sydney Sutherland, from that mo- ment It              ( Edith returned hastily when she beheld me in Mr. Manley's arms. I did not see them exchange glances, I was too flustered to look up. He saw my nervous state, and kindly drawing my arm within his own, conducted me to the cabin. He had a soul to feel for one in my poor and unprotect- ed condition. He seated me comfortably,and passed over to Edith. His face was from me, as they conversed, but hers- was radiant with- satisfaction. I felt in my heart a strange wish of mingled: anguish and remorse, as I beheld them--a wish that I had nzever -wet him!   CHAPTER V. I met thee in a luckless hour.--ToMsoN. M R.

I read it in that proud glance. She looked brilliantly beautiful in the ball-room, thati night; I thought God had never created a lovelier being. I saw Mr. Manley's, eyes follow her, as she floated, like thistle-down on a balmy breeze, through the mazy dance. I tried to read his feel- ings, in his eyes. They were calm, but liquid, and his face was grave and placid, as when I saw him through the half-open door of-the steamer. He could not help loving her, I thought, but his discre-, tionary mind led him to a. system of wooing unlike that of those who fawned and fluttered around her. He was too proud and self conscious to bend easily. He would stand aloof awhile, and approach gradual, ly, at her inviting smiles.  3 I watched to see him lead her forth as a partner in the amusement, but he did not dance.

I grieved for my engage- ment, my poverty, and plainness I I knew I had never loved Sydney Sutherland with all the capa- city that I then felt within me, but the knowledge ; had come too late!  I saw him approaching the window where I stood concealed. Would he come out? I asked myself, in trepidation. I looked around for a refuge, but saw none. I meditated springing from the portico into the garden, but the height forbade it; my neck would certainly suffer by the leap. Reader, he did come out I I saw his fine form outlined in the lamp-light. I had shrunk into the farthest corner of the veranda, and longed for the " invisible ring"I had heard of in my child- hood.                 ^ He hesitated a moment, upon discovering me, as though meditating a ietreat, then came slowly up. There was no possibility of escape,and I stood my ground bravely, externally, but there was a storm  within. He bowed as he recognized me. There was a grace, dignity*and composure in that gentle inclination.

My timidity vanished, for I felt that I was in com- munion with a kindred spirit-one that could sym- pathize with my every thought and emotion.

Strangers in a strange land, but little was known of their former circumstances and social position, though their refined manners and cultivated minds evidenced a brighter'fortune and more elevated station in earlier years. In his fifth year, little Ralph was left fatherless, and his delicate, consumptive mother bequeathed him to the cold charities of the world, ere ten sum- mers had shed their sunshine and shade over his helpless head. To maintain her reputation for benevolence and exemplary Christian character, how obtained, only the hypocritical pretender can elucidate! Mrs. Penton received the friendless orphan under her roof, and thus added another laurel toathe crown of conceded righteousness. - Mris. Fenton was a prominent member of the Protestant Episcopal Church. She sighed devoutly over her elegant prayer-book, and received, at the holy altar, the broken body and shed blood of our (96)   THE ROD AND REPROOF.      97  Lord Jesus Christ, while her little pale prqotgd was weeping tears of childish anguish over the memory of his dead mother, in her dark and dingy ? a garret, or spelling out the words in his liAtie I  primer, off in some quiet nook of the old garden, wrapped in the cast-away garments of her elegantly attired son, who, though one year the junior of little Ralph, sat demurely beside his dignified and pious (?) mother, in her richly cushioned and " carpeted pew, only restrained from squirming and yawning with soul-weariness by the reflection of "a certain something after that" when the hall door of his home had closed behind him. Master Bob knew from past experience, it was "better to brave the ills he had," than to provoke an after-piece. The world commended her charity,: and Mrs. Fenton smiled saint-like, as she received its flatter- ing expressions of admiration and praise. Little Ralph had never heard her soft, silvery voice in the outer world, or he would not have recognized her in the domestic circle, for Mrs. Fenton's religion, like the chameleon, changed with surrounding circumstances. Mrs. Fenton was "monarch of all she surveyed," in her elegant home. Her liege lord, little meek- eyed Lawrence, had wedded her for convenience, and was constitutionally formed to be wholly con- tent with a No. 2 position under his matrimonial roof. Physically little Lawrence would have come out of a  connubial contest second best, as-his physique grew "small by degrees and beautifully  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8303-00000050"/> ?',f * 98    REGINALD'S REVENGE; OR, less.' beside his magnificently constructed conjugal partine -  "   :Mr. nd .Mrs. Fenton's wedded life was mild as 1^^'": '4" ay:!o rning, so far as- they individually were cofncerned i for little X Lawrence invariably suc- cumbed toi*s better-half's superior judgment, and beat a hasty; retreat before her two-edged sword of a tongue, whenever it betrayed symptoms of an onslaught among the children and servants, and all opposing forces. - Mr. Fenton verified to the letter the old adage -" first at a feast and last at a fray," as his rotund little person and full moon of a face bore ample testimony. He would sit an hour at his sump- tuous boatrd, luxuriating in the delicacies before him, and run as fast as his well-gorged corporation would admit, from the slightest premonition of a domestic squabble. He was good-natured, as all lazy imitations of manhood are, and though no church-member, was less feared and better loved by his children and servants, than their sanctimonious mother and mis- tress. Little Ralph would have found a kind shelter under his protecting wing, but for his pusillanimous fear of incensing his domineering spouse. He sat silently, as she dealt blows upon the : -ophan's little weary head, and offered him a kind word in secret.

Weak and ignoble as his spirit was, we will not slander human nature by asserting that Mr. Fenton loved his wife. He confessed secretly, that he had never harbored the tender passion; his mental mechanism was too frail to sustain the burden.

Mr. Fenton thought if Mrs. Fenton was a fair specimen of the church's piety, he could manage to get to heaven without it; and, thus he travelled on down the winding-way of time, stumbling at every step  over his wife's hypocrisy!  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8303-00000051"/> 100    REGINALD'S REVEXNGE; OR, "Let me help you to some of the steak, my dear -:-said Mr. Fenton one morning.

Little Ralph entered with a plate of hot mpffins, soon after Mrs. Fenton's declension of her lord's proffer on the score of fast-day; for the poor orphan was not permitted to sit at table with the rich family, but took his meals in the kitchen with the servants, and was subjected to any office that kept him in constant motion, in order to " pay for his keeping."

His childish heart had grown strong and intrepid; he defied ghosts and hobgoblins, and slept as fearlessly, in his lonely and gloomy garret, among the scampering mice and chirping insects, as master Bob in his richly fur- nished and taper-lighted chamber. It was a soul-saddening contrast-the sallow, lean, overtasked, friendless little orphan boy, slum- bering from sheer fatigue, upon his coarse pallet of wheat-straw, made by auntf Dinah's kind but clumsy fingers, upon the dusty floor. of that dim, prison- looking attic, and the plump, pampered and rosy- cheeked youth, snoring amid the down and' snowy fixments of his costly couch, beneath the same roof I The angels looked down- from their star-homes nightly, and beheld a Dives and a Lazarus inbthe home of a professing Christian I With the dawn of day, little Ralph's perpetual round of monotonous and laborious duties began, (106) *     n                    s-   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     107 while the red morning sun had gone on his journey for hours, along the blue upland-way, ere master Bob rolled lazily from his cosy nest, and went, with hair "'like quills upon the fretful porcupine," snappish and yawning to his morning meal. Master Bob inherited his mother's nature, unfor- tunately, and snubbed the poor boy at will, for his own amusement, and with impunity, until Ralph's spirit rose, one day, when forbearance was no longer a virtue, and thrashed his tormentor to his heart's content.! His little back and shoulders suffered severely for the indulgence of his pug- nacity, from his indignant mistress' lash, but mas- ter Bob never thereafter ventured to provoke a similar chastisement from the poor boy. But the two youths were ever afterwards hostile to each other, and Bob embraced every opportunity to make his young foe feel the fire of his burning spite, whenever he could accomplish it beyond the reach of his returning shot. Little Nelhe was a fac simile of her father in person, and inherited the best traits of his charac- ter. She had, happily, escaped the -transmission of his weakest points, and combined his physical beau- ty with mental strength and intellectual bright- ness. In her was developed all that he might have been, through the exercise and culture of his in- herent possessions and powers.

She was gentle and  obedient, but the antagonism of their temperaments repelled her warmest affections, and sent them over to her father in sympathy and congeniality. Mr. Fenton loved his daughter as he had never loved a human being since the days of his infancy; he had idolized his mother, but she was early taken from him, and an inebriate father was illy quali- fied to " train up a child in the way he should go ; thus the garden of his young heart was left to run to waste. There were germs of nobleness and beauty in his soul, but they had been early dwarfed and debilitated, and had never brought forth fruit to perfection. Nelhe was five years the junior of Ralph, and pitied the poor boy's condition from the inmost recesses of her sympathizing little heart. Mrs. Fenton forbade all intercourse between the chil- dren, lest her own should imbibe the mean spirit and plebian. sentiments of the young pauper, and Nel- lie's compassionate soul rebelled against the unjust interdiction. She had constituted herself Ralph's teaclter, and was tempted to 'duplicity by this ma- ternal prohibition. She secretly supplied the poor boy with books, and as often as opportunity offered, heard him recite his lessons. She did not always escape detection in- this labor of love, and her little ears blushed crimson beneath the heavy hand of her incensed mother.

Such opposition only served to increase little Ralph's ambition for knowledge. He possessed a most inquiring- mind and a strength of character that impelled him to persevere in spite of all obsta- cles. He carried his book in his pocket, and de- voted to its pages every moment he could snatch from the fleeting hours. On Sunday he accom- plished much, for Mrs. Fenton durst not risk her reputation -for piety by requiring him to labor on that holy day.

WTHEN the morning sun glanced through the crimson curtains of the east, and beheld the startled countenances of the inmates of Fenton Hall, little Ralph was far away, trudging along the high-road, with his bundle on his back, swung over his shoulder upon a hickory stick. Friendless Ralph felt free as the birds that twittered among the boughs above his old straw hat, and he now and then whistled a merry strain to the wild warblers that fluttered about his path, and peeped at him through the leaves with their shining black eyes. Ralph had intentionally taken a southern course, and when the round red sun lay down in a purple pile of gorgeous clouds in the low west, the ab- sconding youth had measured many miles from the home of his h6artless and hated mistress. He had found a friend, during his- journey, in the person of an old grey-headed negroess, who re- minded him of aunt Dinah by her pitying expres- sions for the forlorn child, and supplied him plenti- fully with food sufficient for the day's march.

Ralph now began to look about him for a lodg- ment-for the night. His day's journey had been pleasant and -prosperous, but the country was dark and wild, and thinly populated, and he feared to sleep among the trees lest, peradventure, a hungry beast might make a meal of his small self, without any scruples of conscience! Ralph's black hair began to stand on end with apprehension, as the twilight deepened around him and no signs of a human habitation became visible. He-was reflecting seriously upon the advisability of taking a tree for the night, and trusting to Providence till morning, when the" gee-haw!" of a' guttural voice fell upon his eager ear.

"Please let me ride a little bit, uncle? I'm mighty tired." "Sartin', chile--jump up behine dar-gee-haw! git up heer 1" and another lash fell lumbering upon the tough beasts--"Got any 'baccy, massy?"

I dunno whar you kin git a place in dese diggin's, chile." Poor Ralph's spirits sank at this information; he had not sought for a home during the day, but now he considered himself far enough from Mrs. Fenton to settle down in a safe harbor. An imposing and brilliantly illuminated mansion burst upon his sight; through a beautiful grove, as the lazy oxen rounded the corner and turned up a by-path. "Dare, you kin stay yander, chile, twel ter-mor- rer, annyhow-da'll take keer uv ye-po thing!" "I'm afraid to go there, uncle." "What fur, chile?"

The old servant looked at Ralph's ragged trousers, sorrowfully, and said," you's had a hard time in de worl' ain' you, chile?'? Ralph told his new friend something of his young trials, reserving the fact of his being a fugitive. "Dad drap 'er!" growled his sympathizing inter- locutor, "she'll pay fur it when de ole Harry gits 'er-fore de Lord! he'll make 'er smell fire 'n brim- stone-dat's de trufe!" But no assurance could induce Ralph to approach   the stately mansion; he had a childish horror for fine dwellings and aristocratic paraphernalia. He slept in uncle Jacob's cabin upon a clean pallet, spread by the old negro's kind-hearted help-meet, with a good, substantial supper for a bed-fellow, and went trudging on his way, with the earliest song of the morning birds, grateful for the good fortune that had followed him since his escape from Mrs. Fenton. Ralph's little heart was soft and gentle save when he remembered his stonysouled mistress: the gall of bitterness welled up, at the remembrance of her cruelties, and a deeper yearning for revenge strengthened within him. Many suns rose and rounded over his young head, and yet Ralph was homeless. He had not suffered from inanition, but his little feet were sore and blis- tered by long travel, and once he had been forced to sleep upon the limb of a tree, with his little body lashed to its great trunk to avoid the catastrophe of gravitating earthward during somnolence. Ralph was getting tired of a gipsey life. The sun was slowly sinking in the golden horizon, when the little wanderer came in sight of a hum- ble but neat-looking tenement, set down in a neat enclosure, and shaded by thick, breezy maples and running roses. It looked the very picture of con- tent and kindness, and Ralph's weary little feet turned longingly through the small gate, and ap- proached the plainly-attired matron, at the thresh- old.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8303-00000061"/> 120    REGINALD'S REVENGE; OR, "Please let me stay here to-night, ma'am?

Ralph's young heart went out to the kind matron at the first" tone of her voice; its gentle, soothing accents reminded him of his dead mother, and his pale lips quivered with emotion, as she smoothed his dark hair and encouraged him to feel easy in his strange quarters, "You are a tiny bit of a bairn to be wandering about all alone, my dear; where do you come from, and where are you going, my child?" "I come from London, with papa and mamma, ma'am, when I was 'most a baby; they's both dead now, though, and I'm tryin' to find a home, but no- body wants me! they say I'm too little to do much ; but I'm fourteen, and- can work mighty hard, too; I'm used to it."

After the rough storm upon the deep waters of distress and desolation, he had been moored, by an unseen Hand, into a calm and secure haven. Ralph was grateful, and believed firmly in the existence of a God now, but the bitter waters of hate and revenge would rise in his soul-sormetimes, when he retrospected his past condition, and inun- date his better feelings. He had now time enough for study, and a kind helper in the amiable Mrs. Hartwell, so far as her capacity extended, and he progressed with sur- prising rapidity. Mr. Hartwell also assisted him when his daily labors were done and a cheerful winter fire crackled upon the clean hearth, and through the long summer evenings.

Relieved from constant fear and oppression, his little lean form expanded and rounded, and his large black eyes sparkled and smiled with health and happiness over two plump and ruddy cheeks. It was universally conceded, by all who saw him in his new home, that Ralph Reginald was " a beautiful boy." Mr. Hartwell was not a rich man, but " well to do in the world '--respected for his veracity and inflexible probity, and loved by all his neighbors for his benevolence and -genuine piety. His house was the " preacher's home," when the itinerant minister filled an appointment at the little brown country church, hard by the honest farmer's humble but comfortable habitation, and Ralph had the bene- fit of their instructions and counsel, during their transient visits. His thirst for knowledge and his precocity interested them, and rendered him an object of peculiar favor with the travelling clergy. Ralph had attended the country-school two sessions, and astonished his tutor and fellow- students by his rapid advancement, when Mr. Browrwas appointed to the Roanoke Circuit by the Methodist Episcopal Conference, in the boy's sixteenth year. Mr. Brown's attention was soon arrested by the youth's talents and embryo greatness, and devised   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     125 a plan for his promotion, which was, to enter him at Chapel Hill College as a beneficiary. Ralph's heart palpitated with an accelerated movement at the prospect, and bright, golden visions of "much learning" flitted through his young, ambitious brain. Mr.-and Mrs. Hartwell acceded to the good man's proposal, for the boy's benefit, and reluc- tantly saw him depart with his Rev. benefactor. Ralph was duly installed as a member of the Institution, and well he repaid his friend's atten- tion and interest, by his steady application and unimpeachable conduct. Five years passed away with their many revolu- tions and changes, and the little ragged, pale orphan-boy, that begged with tearful eyes a night's lodging at Mrs. Hartwell's door, seven years- before, was a tall, robust, well-dressed and hand- some man, returning from Chapel Hill to the same roof that sheltered him in his young helplessness, with his blazing diploma in his broadcloth pocket I Verily, the YEARS write marvellous histories, and work wonderful transformations!-old Time sets- up kings, and pulls down empires and dominions!

Truly, "a man's gift- maketh room for him? and bringeth him before great men." Ralph now resolved to qualify himself for the pro- fession, and forthwith entered upon the study of law, with the kind old walking-encyclopedia for a master. He accepted the situation of teacher, in the old school-house where he had formerly been a pupil, and prosecuted his studies with a zeal and whole- heartedness characteristic of the oppressed orphan- boy poring over his greasy primer in Mrs. Fenton's gloomy garret. At twenty-three he was duly qualified, and ad- mitted to the bar, and had stood up in the hall of justice, in the little shire-town of W , before his admiring master, and successfully defended his first client. Ralph's progress was steadily "upward and onward." But a cloud came over his sky, in the death of his loved and loving foster-father, when the sun of prosperity shone brightest upon the morning of his manhood; and ere he had attained his twenty- fifth year, Ralph had shed tears of sorrow and affection upon two graves in the little dim church- yard I Mr. and Mrs. Hartwell, side by side, " slept well," and the monument that Ralph erected to their memory, told the living who "viewed the ground," that " they died in the Lord."

Ralph retraced the road he had traversed ten years before, and gathering a leaf from the old tree in which he had slept, a friendless, horieless little boy, the strong-hearted, gifted man laid it carefully in his memorandum-book, as a memento of early years. On the eve of the third day his spirited steed bore him in view of the elegant mansion he had refused to enter, long ago, through fear of its aris- tocratic surroundings, and Ralph looked eagerly about him for his old friend and host-uncle Jacob. He had resolved to obtain an interview, if he were yet in the land of the living. A wide field stretched away between him and the mansion, over which broad, level area the young spring corn gently bent in the light evening breeze, and our traveller's black eyes scrutinized every sa- ble face that bent over the hilling hoe, and followed the cutting plow ; but Ralph's search was fruitless.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8303-00000065"/> 128    REGINALD S REVENGE; OR,     ' -The laborers amused themselves with a song as they finished their day's tasks,-and the clear, rich voices that rolled up to the blue heavens, interested and saddened him by their plaintive cadences and long-drawn syllables.

He visited the young lawyer at his office, stated the 'case- and asked advice, anticipating his hearty cooperation, from a knowledge of Ralplh's hatred for Mrs. Fenton. Ralph, finding that a verdict had been rendered for the defendant, and a new trial granted to the plaintiff, who thereupon immediately ordered his .suit to be dismissed, from pecuniary inability to con- tinue it, which the court had permitted,--and no judgmei t having been entered, on the verdict, so as to bar any future action, therefore no bar existed ; he took the matter-in -his own hands, merely stipu: lating, as his fee in case of success, the Fenton mansion. Ah! the thorn of animosity rankled deep in his unregenerate heart ! In six months Efter Ralph's appearance in Al- verton, as an Attorney, Mrs. Fenton 'was reduced from affluence to comparative poverty, through the agency of the ragged pauper-boy whom" she had so cruelly treated: in -by-gone days, and he was the possessor of the mansion in whose garret he had dragged out more than four miserable years! thus verifying the Word: "He that covereth his sins shall not -prosper.' Mr. Fenton was now in as " evil a case" as Ralph had ever bemoaned : .he had a shrew for a wife, and no wealth as a compensation! but his inherent ; strength now shone forth for his idolized dauglh- ter's sake.

Bob, who had been reared as a gentleman at large, without employment or profession, quitted the town in a rage that did infinite credit to his mother's violent temper, and took up a line of march to the shout of " Westward ho !

She could not shut out from her guilty conscience the words: " I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay-tree: yet he passed away,--I sought him but he could not be found." Mrs. Fenton wept tears of anger and hate, mingled with remorse: memory was active during her daily avocations, and poverty was teaching her penitence. .

Auiint Dinah wept tears of joy and sorrow, when Ralph took possession of his new home; she was more forgiving than her young master, and shed tears of sadness for the fate of her old mistress, while our hero compressed his lips closely, and locked up his bwn- feelings with the key of obmu- tescence; -yet away down in his soul was groaning the hoarse sound that had followed him ten long struggling years--"REVENGE! REVENGE!" But aunt Dinah did not grieve long over the change-it was not in human nature ; she no longer got a head-ache from a hasty and irritable thump, and was mistress of the key-basket, yet she visited the fallen Fe tons frequently, without " let or hin- drance," to offer consolation in her peculiar way. Nellie greeted her eagerly, for Ralph was the old negro's theme, and the loving girl never wearied of hearing his praise. She knew he possessed a noble heart, and his hard lot in boyhood palliated his unforgivihg spirit, in the fair maiden's mind. She loved him, in spite of his hardness, and prayed daily, nay, hourly-for Ralph was ever in her thoughts-that God would " take away his heart of stone, and give him one of flesh," thfat could forgive and forget her mother's wrongs to the little helpless I   THE BROD AND REPROOF.     1 orphan-boy of long ago ,;but the heavens were brass, and no signs of a " elting mood" appeared in Ralph's demeanor, whenever they casually met. The courted and flattered man mingled much in the gay world, where Nelhe was no longer seen, and danced and smiled, the gayest of the gay, till rumor whispered that'Miss Fanny Farley would soon become the bride of the handsome and elo- quent lawyer. Nellie caught- the floating sound, and her whitening face betrayed the inner stuggle, but no word of comment escaped her lips. Ralph was poring over the morning paper, in his bachelor home,-both patent-leather boots perched upon the glittering fender, and a fragrant Havana protruding from his finely cut lips, while aunt Dinah rattled the china upon the breakfast-table, as she cleared the board. Suddenly his fine face flushed to a crimson hue, his black eyes grew larger and brighter, and a radiant smile lighted up his handsome countenance. All throughll the day it was bruited throughout the town that " lawyer Reginald had fallen heir to the princely fortune of his grandfather, the earl of Montrose, who had recently deceased, and beqeathed his vast possessions to his only daughter; or her de- scendents, if she-Mrs. Mary Reginald-who had emigrated to America twenty-one years ago, was no longer living."

Our hero bore his great good fortune with calm dignity, and soon the city papers announced his de- parture for Europe, in an editorial long and loud enough to satisfy the vainest of the vain. Mrs, Fenton pressed her lips closely, as she. caught the flying news, and a paleness overspread her cold face; conscience stung her for her injus- tice to the poor 'orphan boy, and robbed her of peace in watching his prosperity. Had she been humane, and a mother to the motherless, what honor would now be reflected upon her, in lieu of poverty, and reproach, and a galling memory. Her daugh- ter might have been the wife of the grandson of an English noble-for Mrs. Fenton had early de- te6ted their young partiality, and feared it-instead of toiling for her daily bread, and wasting her youth and beauty in neglect and obscurity. She knew Nellie's love for Ralph-she had seen it in her brightening eye, when they met, or his praise was sung by the popular voice, and in her colorless face, when the rumor of his marriage with Fanny Fenton reached her ear.

She suffered from the knowledge that her gentle, uncomplaining daughter was reduced to labor, and slowly wasting away with secret sorrow, for her sins! She now realized what Ralph felt when she con- sidered him destitute of sensibility and unworthy of education, simply because of his poverty; she was forsaken by-her old associates, and coolly passed by those who had once courted her society, because of her station ; and Mrs. Fenton keenly felt her in- justice to the poor, friendless boy, now far her su- perior in wealth, talents and station. Mrs. Fenton found there was retributive justice in the earth, when Nellie's waxen cheek premonished her of con- sumption; and Bob's complaining letters were an occasional thorn in her remorseful memory.  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8303-00000080"/> CHAPTER IX.

Four years had elapsed since they last ported, and Mr. Brown, though apprised by the public journals.'of his old favorite's: good fortune, was utterly igno- rant of his locality,-until his arrival in Alverton. He soon, learned Ralph's whole history, and , sor- rowed for the vindictive spirit clearly evidenced by recent transactions. The -good man could not regard Ralph's conduct as the world viewed it-he did not justify his measures upon the ground of past oppression. ' Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us," was written with the Spirit's stylus upon his holy heart. Mr. Fenton's mother was a member of the Meth- odist church, and he had ever retained a partial- ity for that denomination, but was led off by his proud wife to the "high church," where she had attended from childhood. But with her reduced circumstances, and the desertion of her aristocratic friends, Mrs, Fenton had consented to attend a plainer sanctuary, for a triple reason: firstly, there was no pew-rent, which she could ill afford; secondly, she could no longer compete, in costly- and fashionable apparel, with her old associates; and thirdly and lastly, her humble cottage was distant from the " high church " and in the vicinity of the " low," the " shouting sect," so denominated  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8303-00000081"/> BREGINALD S REVENGE ; OR, -    by lthe 1' upper-tendom."

Mrs. Fenton had leasrned ,a; sad- and long lesson, since her downfall, that she had never conned in the sunshine of wealth and high social position. Mr Briown soon found his way into her- cottage from desi:refor apersonal acquaintance with Ralph's old mistress, and Istartled and interested them with - a revelation-Ne llie, particularly--of the orphan boy s:life in, North Carolina; and ere Ralph's return,-the good pastor had enrolled the names of : the three Fentons upon his book of churchl-mem- bership.

Mr. Brown's eloquent and impressive discourse, from the text---'If ye forgive not men their tres- passes, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your trespasses," did not one whit relieve his aien- tal excitement.

I robbed you of them, and it is in my power to make restitution! -My wife shall forget the wrongs of her secret lover, in her husband's devotion." But Nellie's happiness had already swallowed up the memory of the past, so far as feeling was concerned; the horizon of her sky wore a brighter blue and sunnier sheen, for having been obscured by a sable cloud of sorrow. Ralph anxiously awaited Mrs. Fenton's coming, and the low knock that heralded her return called up a smile of anticipation to his soul-lit face.   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     176 There was no longer dread to subdue, or pride to conquer, in him; his heart had been softened by his confession to Nellie, and her sweet acknowledg- ment of reciprocated love. Mrs. Fenton's feet became rooted to the spot, and her thin face grew paler, as her eyes fell upon her old enemy, seated with so much complacency under the humble roof to which he had maliciously driven her, from the proud home of her youth.  His appearance there filled her with apprehensions of further trouble and misfortune. She considered him her implacable enemy-one that was past redemption in his natural state, and he had mani- fested no symptoms of " repentance towards God." Ralph advanced towards her, soberly, both- hands crossed behind him. "Mrs. Fenton, I need not recapitulate the story of by-gone years: it is printed by the great press of memory upon the leaf of your conscience. Shall it be stereotyped by continued enmity, and handed down, through the years that may come, to tell how human hearts can hate and revenge? or, shall we blot it from the book of life, and write in its stead, with the fluid of friendship, "Forgive and Forget?"-he extended his hand. Nellie trembled and smiled as she awaited the result unseen. Mrs. Fenton burst into tears as she laid her hand, now, hardened by toil, upon his soft palm, once lean ,nd begrimmed by daily labor for her.

She was beautiful even in her misery. A casual observer would have thought the- light breath had escaped forever from  those exquisitely chiselled lips, and her mother, her widowed mother, who sat near her, seeking consolation from the holy word  of inspiration, ofttimes paused in her heavenly re- search for some slight indication of vitality, which was evinced by a soft undulation of the fleecy folds &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8303-00000094"/> 186      ITALIA ALMAN;.

The long dark lashes that fringed her closed eyelids, pencilled her child-like cheek, so pale and fair, and the golden brown hair, pushed carelessly back from the blue-veined and transparent brow, lay in shining rings upon the snowy pillow, from between which a white, unfolding rose-bud, with a tiny tear-drop trembling in its pure heart, in the golden light of the night lamp, peeped forth, as if to vie in 'whiteness with the dimpled hand that nes- tled beneath the young cheek of the sorrowing one. On-that same sweet night in June, a little group was gathered in a vine-latticed porch near a silver lake that flashed and sparkled in lthe calm moon- light. Far away, through a deep beautiful grove of leafy trees that waved silently in the soft breeze, looked down upon the little circle the pretty white cottage of widow Alman, from its mountain site. "Poor Italia!" said the 'mother, " she is so sen- sitive and delicate, I' fear she will break her heart with grief if you persist in you present purpose, Harry.

Obey the mandate of your country's call, and when peace is restored to our beloved land, I shall glory in the consciousness that one in whose veins courses my own life-tide, stood boldly forth :in her defence. I only regret that these palsied limbs and feeble frame are incapacitated from bearing you company." "Brother! dear brother!" cried the fair girl, that leaned almost lifeless upon her mother's bo- somn; and starting up with a sudden effort, she twined her white arms about his neck--"I should be unworthy of you," she said, " if my heart could falter at your decision.

Scarce had his foot crossed the threshold, when the soft arms of the fair young dreamer upon the low couch were twined around him, and a tear wet his cheek as he pressed her trembling lips. "What! in tears my own Italia?" he exclaimed, forcing a smile to dispel her own sadness-"Does your patriotic nature waver as the trial-time ap- proaches? Does your firm heart quail before the apparitions of fancyv's conjuration, and would you speak one word to deter me from flying to the defence of our own native land?" "No, Harry, no," replied she, striving to repress her tears--"I would not place so dark a stain upon your untarnished name and nature.

Italia Alman sat gazing out upon a bright sum- mer sky, and the moonlight's gold falling upon her attenuated form, revealed but a wreck of her former self. The cool winds stealing through the curtained window, lifted the bright curls from her white forehead, and soothed. her throbbing heart with their delicious breath. The sweetness of a starry night, the little lake shining far away, and the tranquil loveliness of Nature's blooming face, lulled her to a dreamy listlessness, and her low, sweet voice rose in song upon the hushed air, startling her mother-by its long-silent melody. She sang, and listening nature caught the low, heart-sound, and bore it on its balmy wing to lend new music to its own --sweet sighs.

"What can it mean, Mary?" she continued, as a young girl entered the apartment, and stopped with surprise, at the strange inquiry, and. her lady's excited appearance. "Ma'am," said the girl, as Mrs. Wayland, ceased from relating the circumstance, " that reminds me of a mysterious affair, last night. I was sitting at my chamber window, gazing up at the blue sky be spangled with gold, as usual--for you know they call me the star-gazer--when a low sound attracted my attention, and leaning from the open lattice, I observed the figure of a man stealthily approaching the parlor window, where you and Minnie sat with Parson Dale.

The hoarse thunder of old Otto's voice,' in hot pursuit of the flying foe, interrupted the narration of Mrs. Wayland, and carefully securing the prem- ises against the intrusion of midnight marauders, the three retired to their chambers, wondering and ill at ease. The morrow's sun threw his broad smile over the quiet mountain village, and his bright- beams fell in a shower of sparkles amid the quivering foliage of the dark, beautiful grove that environed the pleas- ant mansion of Mrs. Wayland, ldoking like golden spangles dotting a crimson robe.

A S the brilliant flames curled aloft over the city of New London, the light of the conflagration fell upon a pale maiden who wandered among the massacred on Groton hill. Tremblingly she look- ed upon the silent forms around, but- no familiar face was there. On, on she went, wildly brushing- the death-dewed looks from each cold face, and re- coiling in horror as the glazed eyes looked into her own despairing ones. On, on she ran, in that place of death, alone. With a wild scream she suddenly threw herself upon a rigid form stretched upon thte cold, blood- stained earth, and fondlypressed the icy lips of the loved one. She laid her hand upon his heart-a slight tre- mor played beneath it, and with a glad cry she staunched the tiny stream that slowly oozed from a ghastly wound. Casting a glance of horror upon another face that lay beside him, she darted along the banks of the Thames, and when Godfrey Way- land awoke from his fainting sleep, the form of his hated rival had disappeared.

By the side of the sick couch stood a fair young girl, watching with intense interest the fine but death-like countenance before her. An old veteran, whose silver locks bespoke the frosts of many winters, stood with folded arms at the feet of the departing one. "It will soon be over-" he said; " the death- struggle will soon be passed, my child; bow to the will of the great Dispenser with meekness and resignation." ,  A heart-sob from the weeping girl awoke the sleeping sufferer, who opened his wild dark eyes upon her. "Cousin!" burst from his feeble lips, as he recognized the pale mlourner-- " where am I? whence come you, Julia? Italia--" he could add no more, but sank back fainting upon the pillow. The old man sprang to resuscitate relaxed animation, while the maiden dropped by the bed-side and adored the heavenly powers for this first faint indi- cationl-of sanity. The bright moonlight stole through the lattice that lovely eve, and mellowed around a snowy couch surrounded by four grateful, happy hearts. "Speak not now," said the old man, as the in- valid looked inquiringly around; " the life-thread may be broken by the slightest exertion.

The feeble sufferer spoke but one word as he' looked upon the fair girl-"Italia." "I know nothing of her," said the poor victim of a hopeless love, turning ashy white at his in- quiring gaze; " it has been long since we met, and I have not dared to encourage a hope in her heart that I could not myself entertain. I was but return- ing to my own home after a long absence, when the invasion of Arnold drove me from the city, and thinking, perchance, to find some of my kindred among. the slain, I entered -the blood-stained fort, and with the assistance of this good father, bore you to this cottage." The listener closed his dark eyes, and a refreshing slumber stole over his weary frame. The car of Time rolled on with laggard pace, and Harry Verner was enabled to roam along the green banks of the beautiful Thames, leaning upon the arm of the gentle girl, his preserver from almost inevitable death. * -ne .

"Shute um down, down! the painted varmints!" cried Otto, jumping up and down in his excitement -" de sneakin' rats don't wuth a living!" A mighty crash levelled the door, and in rushed the armed foe upon the bewildered miscreants.

A fierce struggle ensued, the besieged contend- (226) -1 *   THE CHLD HEIRESS.     227 ing desperately for liberty. Swords clashed, curses loud and deep rose above - the war-din. The little hut quivered to its foundation beneath the mighty conflict. Bravely fought the outnumbered party, till two shots from the Yankee boys laid their victims low. One only remained; Godfrey Wayland contending against the fearful odds. Dashing through the door, he plunged into the gloom beyond, making a sweep at Otto as he went, which left upon his right ear a living monument to the memory of this traitor to his country and outrager of every feel- ing of humanity; but, fortunately for good old faithful, it merely proved the proficiency of the desperado in the science of Division. The three farm youths bounded after the flying foe, joined by Bob Winters and Jo Wilkins ; and anon a shot boomed in the distance.

"You go tu grass!" said Jo, picking up a little ball, and, unrolling it into something like cap-shape, lie brought it with a nervous jerk over his flushed brow, and strode out of the hut just as the first red streak of dawn broke over the eastern hills. The two lifeless forms of the British soldiers being decently disposed of, the still insensible Italia was gently borne to the home of the good farmer, and committed to the motherly care of the pitying house-wife. At an early hour, Otto was again pursuing his Gilpin race in the direction of his mountain home, but with far different emotions than those that had urged him on the night previous.

Weeks wore on, and shadows hovered darkly over two hearths ; uncertainty clouded the fate of Harry Verner, and the veil of mourning clothed each loving heart. The sister of Harry-the love- ly Alice-sat beside the slumbering form of her brother's love, gazing musingly upon the gorgeous beauty of an autumnal sunset, when her father entered the chamber, flashes of delight streaming from his blue eyes, as he joyfully exclaimed: "He lives, Alice! our dear boy lives, on the banks of the Thames, saved by the hand of our returning Julia, from the savage minions of the traitor Arnold, and will soon be back again to his long mourning home!?

A little group was gathered in the vine-latticed porch of Col. Verner, one golden eve. Bright, tearful eyes pierced the settling shadows of the dewy twilight, and far away, along the white road, a carriage rolled with rapid sweep. Nearer and still nearer it came, till the sound of its revolving wheels fell like sweet music upon the fluttering hearts of the anxious watchers. Nearer and still nearer, and the glad -words that rise upon the eve- ning air, as a pale soldier springs to the arms of waiting ones, tell that Harry Verner has come back again. The dark eyes of the beautiful Italia hid their bright sparkles in blushing tremulousness upon his bosom, as the manly arms of the young soldier drew, her willowy form, quivering like a frightened dove, in one long and fond embrace to his warmly- throbbing heart.

As they neared the spot where sat Ellie beside the insensible Mrs. Wayland, she opened her lan- guid eyes, and extended her feeble arms towards the sweet child, then with a faint cry swooned again. Old Howard lifted her from the damp earth, and with the aid of the two girls bore her to her cham- ber.; Assistance was -called to the strange woman who had sought the life of the little innocent, and she, too, ivas conveyed to the mansion of Mrs. Wayland, with the hope- of obtaining from her dying lips the occasion of so unaccountable an adventure,-the wound inflicted by Mr.- Howard's weapon having been examined by Dr. Earle, and pronounced by him to be mortal.

The daylight was fading behind the dim old hills, where the scattered leaves lay in gold and crimson heaps, moaning and rustling in the requiem winds. It was a sad autumnal twilight, and lonely and desolate seemed the still halls of Mrs. Wayland's proud mansion ; lonely and desolate--for death had been there, and suffering threw a dark shadow over each pale face that watched beside a breaking heart.

The little one threw her plump arms over the sleeper, and, pressing her rosy lips to the cold cheek, screamed and clung wildly to the throbless bosom. She could not then realize the extent of this be- reavement, but the tiny helpless one had lost a second motheir.

One moonlight eve she wandered from the bright hearth of her uncle's home, and strayed beneath the almost exfoliated grove that wooded the mountain side, the warm tears trembling over her pale cheek, and bedewing the crumbling foliage that rustled beneath her feet.

I fear you have none of your mother's spirit, my child, or you would have more charity for one who has innocently come between you and your super- abundant vanity." "Innocently!" repeated Harriette; "yes, she was very innocent in calling Merton to come over to her when she saw him approaching me; she was very innocent in taxing all her powers of coquetry to detain him near her throughout the entire evening.

"My child, how can you pain me thus?" said the mother, tears gushing profusely from her eyes, at the heatlessness of her daughter: "you know, Harriette, I am more opposed to Rodman than any of your slitors, and I know you speak thus pur- posely to distress me."

"But you do not suppose," returned Mary, now much interested in the conversation--" that a girl of seventeen can deport herself with all the for- bearance and self-command of a woman of thirty? You do not mean to imply that true love is never accompanied by impatience and jealousy?" "I do mean to imply this," replied Mrs. Monk- ton; "true love and petulant jealousy are alto- gether incompatible. That is not true affection that kindles momentarily into a passionate excite- ment when the object of it looks at or speaks to another. I call not this love, as some term it-- indeed I never could define it unless it is a tortu- ous monomania, for it subverts the peace of both parties, innocent and guilty, if manifested after marriage, and is a-a-feeling, or passion, if I may so term it, that absence will soon extirpate; but this is never cherished by any but selfish, con- tracted, and tyrannical minds. Jealousy! don't tell .me it is the inseparable companion of love-that love canniot be perfect without it; I never could believe in this system as some do-on the con- trary, I should never believe that love perfect or of long duration, where distrust was manifestly a part."

( "Certainly,"-returned Mrs. Monkton, "I will give you an illustration of my views on this subject. Love is an unfathomable deep, like the mighty ocean, still, calm, 'and peaceful, unless rocked by the battling elements of some adverse storm; but not lashed into fury by every little wind that passes' over it. True love is too stable to be shaken by trivial circumstances, like the passion that is frequently mistaken for it, and which may be reckoned like the eddies of the shallow stream that are everlastingly whirling and dashing, and cease- lessly heard in the distance. This is an indication that there is a deeper fountain far away; but it were a miracle, indeed, if the burning rays of dis- trust do not wholly absorb it, ere it emerges into its silent rest." "But you do not mean to say that a light pas- sion may not gradually flow into a deep sea of love?" queried Mary, looking piercingly at Mrs. Monkton. "I believe there is but one basis upon which love ever rests-namely, Virtue-and but one source from whence it can spring, and that is Purity," answered Mrs. Monkton.  "Now you may think it animates bosoms of the vicious as well as the virtuous, and that it may cling as tenaciously around an unworthy as a worthy object. I believe minds, noble by nature but degenerate by art, may love, in every sense of the word; but they plunge        s   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    257 headlong into the sea, dazzled by the extrinsic beauty or brilliancy of the object; but alas 1 how often do they split upon a rock of disappointment, and watch the wreck of hope tossed by the wave of time around them I then they reflect upon the folly of being blind because they would not see. But if you will observe it, such a one never launches forth again without a guarantee of per- fect security. But if the affections of a precipitate heart fortunately rest upon a worthy object, and that/ one, detecting the gem beneath its uncouth maasi, reciprocates the feeling, the least worthy imbibes the purity of its superior, and becomes re- fined and purified; for love purifies the heart, and as 'evil communications corrupt good manners,' so this rule may in all justice be reversed." "I never- heard such a- dissertation in my life, before," said Mary, half laughing, half musing. "I don't know how to decide, really, though it seems very plausible; but I have known one in- stance that would refute your argument. Do you know," said she, turning quickly to Mrs. Monkton, "that I have been married?" "You!" cried Mrs. Monkton, distending her eyes with astonishment-" no, indeed I 'I never had the most remote idea of such a fact." "Well, it is a fact," responded she, "and he whom I married possessed the most contracted mind that ever human form encased, and yet he loved me with all the fervor that ever a -virtuous heart was capable of cherishing."    &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC8303-00000130"/> 258      LILIA ROSELY; OR,-.

"And does an act of jealous desperation confirm the strength of his devotion? But tell me, was he invariably kind, and gentle, and affectionate, to you?" ": Kind, and gentle, and affectionate?" repeated Marv, staring at her; "no, indeed and that is what always puzzled me. - He was sometimes gen- tle as a dove,and his caresses bountifully be- stowed ; but if I cast a casual glance at a passer- by, or returned a salutation, he forthwith construed it into admiration or affection, and would weep and rant like a madman."

"But did- you love him?" inquired Mrs. Monk- ton. ' He is gone now," returned Mary, "and I must not reply to this." "Bt do tell me," said Mrs. Monkton, who under- stood her perfectly, " did you ever love him?" '":Yes, truly I did," cried she, with' an emphasis that admitted of no doubt of her sincerity.

Allow me to read your charac- ter." "Well." "You were once beautiful and admired, which inspired vanity. You possessed a naturally noble and gifted mind, but flattery subverted its best qualities. You met him, a stranger-is it not so?"  "I Yes." "He was handsome, ambitious, and conceited, and, withal, hypocritical. He wooed you from ambition to enjovy a triumph over his many rivals, and when his pride was gratified by the possession of your hand, he became jealous of your love, because he knew himself unworthy. Your daily- increasing indifference, arising from conviction of his unworthiness, drove him to desperation, and in a fit of jealous frenzy he perpetrated an act which you call confirmation of love." "You have read aright!" cried Mary, starting up and traversing the chamber; "it was precisely so; by what instinct judge you so rightly?': "By 'experience, observation, and a knowledge of human nature," answered Mrs. Monkton.

Mary started back, and fell against Mrs. Monk- ton's couch, who did not observe her intense emo- tion. "I did not know, then," continued Mrs. Monkton, "that he loved me, and that a contract between him and my father united him to one who he knew loved another. Mine was an instance in which the least worthy imbibed the purity of its superior, and oh, how grateful am I that Provi- dence interposed to rescue me! for I learned from good authority that the union of Frederic Ray- rmond with one who was said to be my counterpart in mind, though unlike in person, was a most wretched one."

"I have nothing to forgive," said Mrs. Raymond, taking her extended hand.

"Is it possible you think it a change for 'the bet' ter?" said Grace, feeling reproved; "why, she is ready to cry with vexation, because she yielded to her mamma's wishes, (ah, 'there's the rub,'; and Harriette wished heartily that that had been :l! that subjected her to the ridicule of her light-headed-I mean internally-companions,) and I think sher i" not recover to-night; see how cross she 1t;^ : " "She should not have been laughed:,:.f0rvher sacrifice," returned Lilia; "she is a noble giri, :dlyi a little spoiled by flattery; I will endeavor to con- sole her," and she seated herself beside Harriette, leaving Merton with Grace,'who thought -her-vite wreath was about to -triumph, when she Sgwl'him turn his eyes from the simply-adorned heads. of Lilia and Rarriette, to her grand one, with a smile something akin to contempt; (she didn't know -ie ,  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC8303-00000136"/> 270      LILIA ROSELY; OR, looked at hers first;) but, alas for her sweet ribbon and diamond band, he, too, crossed the hall, fol- lowed by Colonel Bentley, and the plain Harriette :;!;f found herself surrounded.

"Pray tell me, Miss Monkton,' said Colonel ,Bentley, "- who is that young lady yonder," mean- ing Gracel; 'and is she a particular friend of yours?" with an indefinable stress upon the word friend. i' 'Thtat is Miss Guyman," returned Harriette, be- giminning to feel a-little uncoimfortable as she looked 'at her 'splendid wreath and thought of her poor pitiful bud, "and she is a particular friend of mine -t -t'tis, one of my associates."

The evening passed delightfully with Harriette, in whose bosom a friendship- had sprung Up for' Lilia, quite as unaccountable to Grace, as her newly- acquired penchant for "'Quakerism," and Harriette would have forgotten that Lilia had not been in- vited, had not a remark of Bentley's refreshed her memory. "- shall never cease to be grateful to the Provi- dence that led me to an acquaintance with your father," said he, bestowing a glance upon her that suffused her cheek with a bright tinge, and he went on, till she gathered the whole truth of the mystery. tHarriette felt more angry with herself than -she had ever with another then, and in her hear tshe:blessed the Providence that had thwarted her mean pur- pose. "And this is the reward of my little-souled in- tentions," thought she, as she ascended to her cham- ber, after the breaking up of the company, to half- stifle aunt Mary with kisses; and in her humility the good spirit triumphed, and her. delighted mother had never more occasion to impute-to her injustice.

"Yes, indeed, it is gone," replied she, putting her little hand, that looked like a damask rose trembling in moonlight, to her head, as if seeking the lost treasure, and turning away that aunt Mary might not see the blush on her cheek. She knew very well where it was, for Colonel Bentley had requested it as a pledge of future friendship; but Harriette didn't care to tell aunt Mary then; she felt fatigued and sleepy, and aunt Mary woun  laugh at her for "rushing headlong into the sea," and with the assurance that it needed not that to remind her of this night, she fell asleep to dream of- we know not what, unless it was of aunt Mary's story, Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;  If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep.

BUT what of Grace? Ah, poor girl I her splen- did wreath looked as fresh and snowy as ever, when she entered her chamber that night, and stood before the mirror; but she was in no mood to ad- mire the beautiful then; and she tossed it from her with an air of disgust. Tired and dispirited, she threw herself on the bed, and burying her face in the pillow, desired to be left alone; and, with.a long-drawn sigh, as much as to say, "how shame- fully I am treated," her mother retreated from the room, leaving her to give free vent to an over- charged heart. Unhappy mother I with what truth she might have said, " It is the work of my hands." Poor Grace! she had seen the last bright star fade from the horizon of hope, and well might that young heart weep in darkness amid the ruins of its sweetest joys. And why? was she not beautiful and rich ? and had she not been flattered, courted, and admired? True; but Grace felt it was the homage of fawning sycophants to wealth and sta- tion, not the tribute of true hearts at the shrine of 12*   &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC8303-00000138"/> 274   -    LT A ROSELY; OR, worth. Had Grace possessed a less noble mind, she would, have returned in triumph to her mother, escorted by the dashing Rodman, who was one of  those butterflies who bask in the rays of fortune, and court alone its favorites, to laugh over the metamorphosis exhibited in the appearance of Har- riette; but Grace's good sense told her it would be the height of folly to ridicule that which had won the respect and deference of a heart she would have given worlds .to secure. The noble Merton, who had stood aloof in- the meridian of her glory and ; triumphant sway, had been lured by her sweet sim- plicity to, render to Harriette the'homage due to her worth; and Grace felt as jealous of her as she had ever of Lilia, because poor Lilia had nought but a pure "mind and lovely face to win her way through the world; while, added to these, Harriette possessed the irresistible charm of gold, and, of course, Grace thought the most powerful magnet- would be the most attractive, without for a moment considering that the proximity of the less would counteract the influence of a more distantf; and while aunt Mary watched the smile on the rosy lip of-. Harriette, and felt that she had been the instru- ment of calling up such beautiful dream-visions, the unhappy Mrs. Guyman bent over the restless piI- lowq of Grace, and through her incoherent wander- ings, that told of a deep heart-sorrow, the misguided mother received the reward -of her folly in the un- happiness-of her child, for with all her faults she possessed a mother's heart.   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.     275 The next morning, Grace received a visit from Miss Wilee, a very beautiful creature with azure eyes and jetty ringlets, who might, with all pro- priety, have been compared to the leopard, for ex- ternal appearance and-disposition. "My dear Grace," cried she, coming into the dressing-room where Grace sat en dishabilk, "how miserable you appear this morning, which is not at all astonishing, considering the dull affair last night; did you ever know anything so absolutely lifeless?" Now it must be confessed that Miss Wilee- had exerted all her powers to entrap Mr. Merton the night previous, and that her ill success had ren- dered her as jealous of Lilia Rosely, as Grace was of Harriette. "It zoas dull," assented Grace, leaning back in her chair, and wishing Miss Wilee any where but there. "And that Lilia Rosely," continued Miss Wilee, "she is the most-soulless, inanimate creature in the universe. I wonder Harriette invited her; I know she never liked her until last night, when there seemed to spring up, most unaccountably, a won- derful 'intimacy between them; but I suppose it was to answer some end which Harriette has in view; you know she is an artful creature." ' And the best skilled in the world," exclaimed Grace, taking fire at the mention of Harriette's name; " did you observe her dress, and what an effect it produced on Mr. Merton?

Grace should not have said so much, for she had resolved she would hereafter accommodate herself to the different tastes of persons ; but alas, for poor human nature I when it begins wrong it cannot be expected to end right, and so Grace and Clara talked on, the best friends in the world, deprecia- ting the absent, and winning each the other's jeal- ousy. Had Mr. Merton fancied either of the young ladies, the rejected one would have despised the other in her heart; but --they had nothing to fear from each other, and of course they were the best of friends. Grace had never felt much attached to Clara, for she knew her to be not very amiable. Mrs. Wilee was a cold-hearted, soulless woman, re- gardless of everything but display, and it could not be expected that Clara should be otherwise; but Mrs. Wilee could not be reproached as having spoiled her daughter--she was so from the begin- ning.

INTER, spring, and summer,-had passed away, T and New York was enlivened by the return )of those who had retired from the dull, heavy at- mosphere of the city, to the salubrity of the fresh country air; but ere we establish them   in their city residences, we will visit them once at their retreat. The sun was just going to sleep behind the white fleecy sheet that spread across the western heavens, and Lilia Rosely sat in a window watching the golden shafts, that ever and anon darted between the silver folds of the tinged curtain that obscured it, as it slowly sank to its rosy bed, wholly uncon- scious of all that was transpiring around her, until the door opened, and a tall, handsome man, of most noble mien and benignant contour of features, en- tered the. hall.  We have only to watch the deep- ening rose on the sweet cheek of Lilia, dear reader, to be assured that one was Mr. Merton; for Lilia [277]  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC8303-00000140"/> 278   -  LILIA ROSELY; OR, never blushed at the sound of any other foot-fall, and she could distinguish that one from all others. Grace and Clara, Harriette and Colonel Bentley, were all there, for Grace and Clara'declared they could not be separated from dear Harriette and Lilia, and they must assuredly visit at the same watering-place. Grace an'd Clara looked daggers at the bloom on Lilia's cheek, and very pleasantly remarked that her health had improved vastly since she left New York, which confused Lilia very much to find her sensitive heart had betrayed her. To screen her- self, she leaned out at the window, just as a very handsome man was passing it. He came up on observing her, and offered to her acceptance a beautiful white rose-bud. - Lilia blushed a -good deal as she- took it, for she thought it might appear as though she had inten- tionallyiarrested his attention. With some pleasant and graceful remarks he passed on, having first engaged her for a party the next evening, for it must be remarked that she was not yet engaged to Mr. Merton, and therefore could not, with the slightest excuse, decline; but Lilia felt exceedingly mortified by the circumstance, and wished, for the first time in her life, thatrMr. Merton had remained absent a few moments 'lo;er. "How very much you prize that sweet bud," said -Clara, as Lilia sat with it to her lip, unconscious of so doing; "you haven't ceased to press it to your lip since Dr. Clayton left."   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    279 Lilia raised her eyes at this, and they met the earnest, inquiring gaze of Merton, upon whose cheek not the least color was. "You know my passion for white buds," answer- ed she, trying to rally her spirits; " and I prize this only because of that fact." "Dr. Clayton appears to be well aware of your preference," continued Clara;'" that withered bud in your braids was given you by him yesterday." "Which must be sufficient evidence of my par- tiality," answered Lilia; "could I have obtained a fresh one, I should not have preserved this so care- fully." Grace gave her a quizzical look, having first taken care that Merton should observe it; then seeming to feel abashed at the detection, with a light laugh left the room. The evening wore away rather heavily to all but Grace and Clara, who were unusually animated, and laughed at Mr. Merton until they succeeded in wiling him away from the vicinity of Lilia, who was far from spirited; for, poor Lilia : there was a weight upon her heart, that rendered her most un- happy; and   Merton, misconstruing her silence, partook of her feelings, and the presence of each was a burden to the other,' Oh, surely, "The course of true love never did run smooth." Dr. Clayton was announced after tea, and took the vacant seat of Merton, to the inconceivable chagrin of Lilia; not that she disliked him, for si A  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC8303-00000141"/> 280      LILIA ROSELY he was a most worthy man; but lilia would much have preferred being left alone, for her head ached badly, and she felt averse to conversation, but courtesy demanded the sacrifice. Lilia had another reason for wishing this; she had scarcely spoken to Merton since the conversation about the rose- bud-a reserve had gradually stolen over both, which she could not shake off, for she felt that Mer- ton might misjudge' her conduct, which she would gladly have explained, had he given her an oppor- tunity, but he seemed determined to preserve ob- mutescence; and what could she do? Poor Lilia I! Merton's attention appeared to be wholly ab- sorbed by Grace and Clara, but his eye would wander to Lilia and Clayton, who sat apart from the rest of the company, and as he saw a deep blush suffuse her cheek, just at the moment her eye caught his, he rose quickly and left the room, though not before he saw Dr. Clayton replace the withered bud in her hair with -a fresh one. That night her pillow was moistened with the dew of an aching heart, and the morrow's sun rose upon her unclosed eyelids.     CHAPTER V.

SHAKSPEARE. WE will now follow them to their city homes, and   attend a party given by Mrs. Wilee, in honor- of her daughter's eighteenth birth-day. Har- riette and Colonel Bentley were there, and report said they were to be wedded in a short time. One thing we know; Harriette had told aunt Mary all about the rose-bud, and aunt Mary had patted her cheek, and said it was a  "precipitate" affair, but one which "the   least worthy would imbibe the purity of its superior ;" and Harriette laughed, and said her mamma was right in saying we could not apply opprobrious epithets to one we truly love. It was late before Lilia entered the brilliant hall, and   when she came, leaning on the arm  of her brother, all eyes turned with astonishment upon them, for it was the first time Lilia had appeared at a  party without Mr. Merton. All1 did I say? no, I meant not that, for Grace and Clara looked quite indifferent; they knew all about it. (281)  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8303-00000142"/> 282      LILIA ROSELY; OR, Lilia's cheek was very pale, and the company thought her country residence had not contributed to her appearance. Mr. Merton came soon after; but he too, looked pale and dejected, and assidu- ously avoided, Lilia; and,scandalous whispers went round -the room, having first started from Grace and Clara. Lilia was -dressed&amp; in a simple white robe, without a single ornament; her hair was smoothly braided and confined by a silver comb, and what; was most unaccountable to, some who knew her best, not a single bud nestled amid its darkl- braids.    - This circumstance was commented upon in the presence of Dr. Clayton, who rose immediately, and taking a beautiful, unfolding, snowy bud from a stand near by, carried it to Lilia. He presented it gracefully, but she did not directly observe him. She started abruptly, when she became aware of his object, and motioned him back, as if fearful of touching it. " hate flowers!" cried she, unconscious of the horror depicted in her countenance, or the construc- tion that might be placed upon her words-"I haven't touched one for years." "You haven't touched one for years!" reiterated Dr. Clayton, in consternation. "You wander, Miss Rosely; 'tis but a few weeks since you accepted one from me." "Oh, I had forgotten," said Lilia, as if awaken- ing from a dream; " but I have lived years since then," she added, seeming to speak mentally-   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    283 wholly unconscious that envious hearts were trem- bling with delight, to gather somewhat whereby they might crush her-to the earth. "Do accept this," persisted Dr. Clayton, placing it in her hank. She shrank back, and suffered it to fall upon the floor. Mr. Merton sprang forward, lifted it from the carpet, and threw it into the street, with flashing eyes. Murmurs went round and round, and Lilia found herself acting in quite a scene. "Pray tell me the cause of your newly-conceived prejudice against a flower that was recently so de- cided a favorite," said Clayton, stationing himself beside her. "I loved white roses when I believed in friend- ship,' answered she. "I once thought white buds typical of some hearts; but circumstances have convinced me that human nature partakes more the dye of the crimson rose,. than the purity of the white;" and her eye glanced towards Grace and Clara, who blushed and turned quickly away, pre- tending they had not heard her. "And you reckon all hearts alike!" said Clay- ton, looking earnestly at her; " do not place me on the crimson list; I deny the imputation of change- ableness.'" "Every one will," said Lilia, " every one is true and faithful till the test -comes-then it is--' Mene, kIene, Tekel, Upharsin. ' "I am utterly confounded," cried Clayton, " to hear you speak-thus; I thought your whole nature  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC8303-00000143"/> 284      LILIA ROSELY; OR, was love, and that you could. not exist without its balmy atmosphere." '"When existing in the sunlight of friendship," answered she, " we think we could not walk with- out; but when it is obscured by the blackness of disappointment, the darkness renders us totally cal- lous to what may surround us, and misanthropy makes us rejoice even in our loneliness." "Good heavens!" cried he, starting in evident surprise--" you surely do not mean this-you can- not!7' "You discover we are all liable to change!" said Lilia. "Your astonishment plainly declares you could not have believed me capable of it." "I cannot believe it now,"' said he-" for once you say what you do not believe; you are deceiv- ing yourself, Miss Rosely." "-You may think so," added she--" but the time may come, when you, too, will doubt the sincerity of all friendships." Metton sat a silent observer of this conversa- tion, pretending to be wholly absorbed by a book he held before him; but he forgot to turn over a leaf, thus inducing the belief that he was either a very slow reader, or a very inattentive one; but as Lilia uttered the last words, he rose and hastily re- tired from the hall. Whispers floated about, after his exit, quite detrimental to the fame of Lilia; who sat with stoical indifference to all around her. The girls drew back, farther and farther, till she was left entirely alone, with the exception of Harriette,   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    285 who clung to her during the evening. Week after week went by, and Lilia heard of parties being given by those who had never before slighted her, but no invitations came to her. Poor Lilia! well might she distrust the reality of friendship. She heard of a splendid affair about to be gotten up at Mrs. Guyman's, but she gave it no heed, for she felt quite sure she would be omitted in the in- vitations, for Grace and Clara had not called upon her since the party at Mrs. Wilee's; but strange to tell, an invitation did come, with a very affection- ate little note from Grace, begging she would not fail on the specified evening. Lilia would have de- clined, but her brother, her nearest relative, a proud, hot-headed, but withal, noble-hearted young man, of two-and-twenty, declared in positive terms she should go, merely to confront those who had insult- ed her, and consequently sent an answer to that effect. Let us go back a little, and investigate this mys- tery. Grace and her mother held. a long confab about the propriety or expediency of inviting Lilia, who owed her good fortune, if we may so term it, for the end proved it so, to the fact that Mr. Mer- ton had never attended a party where Lilia was not, and they knew he had special invitations, so they decided accordingly. This was the whole sum of the mystery. Well, it came at last, and with it Lilia, her brother, and the long secluded Merton. Lilia was dressed in white satin; chain, bracelets, and dia-  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC8303-00000144"/> 286      LILIA ROSELY; OR, mond circlet, that shone brilliantly amid the dark braids of her glossy hair. Not a single bud or delicate flower, indicated that softness of soul that had heretofore characterized her, but she had never looked so brilliantly beautiful.' There was a bright crimson spot on either cheek, that gave a radiance to her Splendid hazel eye, and a most touching deli- cacy to her transparent cheek. tHer slight form looked frail as a lily-stem drooping in an autumn blast; and as Merton's eye followed her, as she moved around the room on the arm of Dr. Clay- ton, there was a something in his heart that seemed to say he had contributed to the unhappiness of one he loved above all earthly beings; but he would question the possibility of this, since Lilia had re- jected his love; and how could he add to her sor- row? he would ask himself, without receiving a satisfactory reply ; and the mournful glance of her eye, whenever he casually caught it, made him truly miserable. ;Dr'. Clayton was untiring in his attentions to Lill, and some of the dashing beaux, dazzled by her transcendent loveliness, wishing to show off to adavantage by engrossing her-attention, were heard to' apply the term "monopolizer," in reference, to him. Clayton overheard it, but knowing the shal- lowness of[ the source, deigned no reply, nor yield- ed his charge, but walked to a stand of roses, and laughngly offeredj Lilia a white bud. Before we proceed, it must be told that Clayton had proposed to Lilia, who had'declined the honor   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    287 of his hand; with the assurance that her affections were not at her own disposal, else her decision had been favorable to his wishes, and he was too honor- able to feel mortified or piqued by. her rejection of his suit; and being really attached to Lilia, he re- solved to promote her happiness, to the utmost of his power, even should it be by facilitating her union with another. This, reader, is what we term love- the pure love of a noble heart! and woe to Merton, had he acted dishonorably, for the comparison would have been fatal to his hopes. But Lilia learned from her cousin Bentley, that Merton had never appeared in company when she was absent; a circumstance' which rendered his conduct un- fathomable, which she longed for an explanation to elucidate. Poor Lilia I she knew not an explana- tion had been sought and received, which drove Merton nearly to despair; but there was one in that assembly who could have revealed the -secret of her brilliant cheek, and Merton's heavy, restless eye; but no marble statue was ever more soulless, and insensible to human kindness than that one. Merton managed to get near Clayton and Lilia as if by chance, and, without appearing to do so; overheard the conversation between them. Clara and Grace had nearly despaired of ever winning him to wear their chains, for he had dexterously escaped every snare to detain him at their side, and thus induce the belief that he was -a devotee at their shrine; and they now watched him with jealous eyes as he stood near the rosestand.  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC8303-00000145"/> 288      TALTA ROSELY; OR, "Do allow me to affix this where it would look so natural," said Clayton, holding up a pretty white bud; "there seems to me to be something wanting, without a bloom of Nature's in your braids." "No," said she; "place it where it will be em- blematical of the spirit-I claim no communion with the soul's sweetness; these diamonds better bespeak my nature." Merton turned quickly- towards her, involun- tarily, but averted his head ere her eyes met his; and conscious of having betrayed himself, walked hastily away, and sat down by Miss Wilee. "Can you tell me," said he to her, trying to speak composedly- "what disappointment Miss Rosely has recently met with?" "Dear me!" cried she; "is it possible you are ignorant of what has agitated the world? but you have lived so retired of late, that I do not wonder at this." "And pray, what may the agitation have issued from?" inquired he. "Why, from Col. Delly's marriage with Miss Morse," said she; "which you know was con- summated a short time previous to our return from the country." Merton pondered it over in his mind, and dis- covered it was precisely the time the change had appeared in Lilia. Clara went on' "'Tis said Lilia was devoted to him, and we really thought, at one time, it would be a match;   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    289 but he finally left her boarding-house, and at length married the daughter of his landlady. I know Lilia wept bitterly the night we were ap- prised of his nuptials, but I have never touched upon the subject in her hearing, from an unwilling- ness to pain her sensitive nature. Poor Lilia I no wonder she doubts all friendships;" and Clara brushed a tear from her pitying eye. Reader, dear, I cannot leave you to suffer from suspense as Merton did, but must tell you that Col. Delly was a rejected suitor of Lilia's--that to ban- ish her from his heart he had left the house where she boarded, and after -one year wedded Miss Morse, whose sweetness of manners reminded him of Lilia's gentle nature. Lilia heard of his mar- riage the day after the breach between her and Merton, and for what her tears were shed can readily be imagined. This was what roused the tenderness of Miss Wilee's nature, and induced her to drop -a tear for poor dear Lilia's unhappi- ness. Merton did not remain longer with Clara, after gathering this information, but retreated from the room.  Lilia saw him depart, and her head grew giddy with some new fear she could not define; for she saw him sitting with Clara, whose friend- ship she had every reason to doubt, and' she re- marked, also, the wildness of his eye as he went out. Clayton endeavored to prevail upon her to sit to the piano, but she positively declined, and begged Clara- to supply her place, which she readi- 13   &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC8303-00000146"/> 290      LILIA ROSELY; OR, ly did, not from a desire to gratify her, but from a wish tAo display her skill as an amateur. The company gathered around the beautiful pianist, delighted by her sweet strains, and Lilia stole un- observed from the room. Her head ached, and she felt sick at heart, and now she prayed the time -would come for her -departure. Merton she thought already gone, and she ran along, uncon- scious whither, in her excitement; for she had turned down a dark passage, and in seeking a win- do w at the farther end, she ran against some one, whose arms immediately closed around her, and she was pressed closely to an unknown bosom. 4Release me!" cried she, struggling for freedom, and terrified by the action. "Pardon me," said the mournful voice of Merton -.. I could not resist so favorable an opportunity of bestowing a first and last embrace upon one whdm H may never more see one whom I have so long but hopelessly- idolized." "You have not offended me," said Lilia, laying her hand upon his arm; " but I thought you gone." Merton said- not a word, but drew her to the window, and by the pale light, that struggled through, their eyes met. What a world of thought and feeling may a single glance express; words could not have spoken half so eloquently, and the first, tears of joy that Lilia had ever wept were shed upon his bosom. Oh, could Grace have seen her there, she would have execrated the hour in which she solicited her presence. And Clara too;   l-n"TRlUMPH OF VIRTUE.    291 she was in the height of her glory, exulting in tile success of her well-devised plan for confirming the tenor of the infamous note she had written in reply to one from him to Lilia, which she had bribed from the servant during their residence in the country. Ah, poor Clara! how little did she then dream she would ere long be dragged from security to open confusion, by the very one Whom she had-so deeply wronged. A step was- heard in the passage, and Merton disappeared through  a  side door, leaving Lilia alone at the window. It was- Clara, who had missed her, and  as guilt is ever cowardly had' gone out to seek her, lest, as she declared, she should become a prey to melancholy, which was evidently seated in her bosom. Lilia went back with her, and  soon after Merton appeared also. Dr. Clayton resumed his place by the side of Lilia, and Merton stationed himself beside Clara, who cast a  look of triumpll towards Grace, whose ill- concealed displeasure rendered Clara more ami- able; and a more spirited creature never received the attentions of an admirer-of wit and beauty Dr. Clayton again begged Lilia to favor him with a song, and unhesitatingly she complied. "How very impulsive," he said, as she rose from the piano; "you seem to think there is such an motion as love yet extant--perhaps you will now ?ccept this bud, which was a   short time since - ejected."

Clayton looked earnestly at her bright cheek and flashing eye, whilst a shade of distress flitted , across his fine brow, and then followed her eye, which-involuntarily glanced towards Aferton. None but he saw the smile exchanged between them, for the action was too quick to be easily detected; but he comprehended it all then. Poor Clayton I! strange that he had not before thought of Merton, for how could he believe Lilia loved one who had wedded'another? Clara had told him all about Col. Delly; but now he sighed as the conviction that she was forever lost forced itself upon his mind. Mr. Merton attended Clara home thlat night, and Grace cried with spite, until " tired nature's sweet restorer" lighted -upon her lids, just as she vowed vengeance upon her dear friend. Oh, friendship! Well, time winged away very pleasantly to all parties. Clara thought her plan had succeeded to admiration, and Grace thought she was the favored one, for Merton was constant in his attentions, and the mothers wondered, which of their daughters would be mistress of the elegant mansion that was being fitted up for the handsome and wealthy Mr. Merton. But now another excitement was produced by the marriage of Col. Bentley with Harriette Monk- ton. Merton escorted Clara -to the wedding, and   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    293 Grace sulked through the evening.  Lilia was there with her simple robe and white bud, but none thought of remarking hier appearance, she was so vacillating of late ;--all agreed on one point, that she was a very unaccountable girl. Tears trembled in aunt Mary's eyes as tEarriette was pronounced Mrs. Bentley, and papa and mam- ma smiled upon their bride daughter. It passed off happily to all but Grace, whose good humor was not restored until AMerton called upon her the next day, and requested her superin- tendence, in connection with Clara and the young ladies who had slighted Lilia, in preparing for a party at his newly-fitted house, which was to come off next week. Grace accepted it, and a merry time they had, for Grace and Clara both thought they were adorning their own home. All things were arranged in order, and the guests assembled at the hour; but Lilia was nowhere to be seen. Clara thought this all right, and her fine spirits diffused light and gladness through the assembly, until the door opened, and a little party, headed by Bentley and his bride, entered the hall, and, wonder- ful to tell, Merton among the number, leading a lady whose face was concealed by a white veil, that defied penetration. An aged minister came for- ward-the party halted, and oh, horror of horrors I! a marriage rite began, which was to unite Merton to the veiled unknown!  The ceremony ended. Harriette removed the bride's veil, and the eye of Lilia Merton rested upon the colorless cheeks of  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC8303-00000148"/> 29.4     LILIA ROSELY ; OR, Clara Wilee and Grace Guyman, who disappeared from the hall without congratulating the newly wedded. "My own at last - ' said Merton, as he stood upon the veranda, in the calm moonlight, with Lilia- folded fondly to his bosom; "no envious heart, or lip of falsehood, can ever separate us now; and he warmly pressed her lovely, smiling lip, while tears of love and joy filled her beautiful eyes as she nestled her blooming cheek upon his bosom. Grace and Clara' did not accompany Mrs. Mer- ton and Mrs. Bentley to the country that summer, but Dr. Clayton and a fair cousin of Harriette's- Miss Julia Monkton-did; and Dr. Clayton was heard to say how very much Miss Julia resembled Mrs. Merton ; and when it called forth the raillery of his companions, because of a' blue-eyed, fair- haired girl being reckoned like a brown-eyed, dark- haired woman, he felt somewhat confused, and con- fessed the resemblance was more in disposition than personal appearance. ' My dear Mrs. Merton," said Dr. Clayton, one day--" do initiate me into the mystery of such sentiments- as you once expressed concerning the reality of friendship." Mr. Merton smiled as he looked at Lilia, then handed, Clayton a copy of the note he had written her, and her reply dictated by Clara, the truth of which she had learned from her maid, who confess- ed her own guilt in the matter, won by the rich   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    295 bribes of Clara. In justice to Grace, we must say she knew nothing of this ; for although shb rejoic- ed at the breach between Merton and Lilia, she 'was naturally too noble-souled to have recourse to so mean a measure to effect it. Clara stood alone in the matter, and alone she bore the censure of all but Rodman, who, to obtain the golden frame, beautified his house "up on Broadway" with the picture.           -  "Pray, what is that?" asked Harriette of Lilia, as she was examining a white rose-bud in a golden case richly set with brilliants. "This," said Lilia, " is the first bud Frank ever gave me; you remember the party at Mrs. Guy- man's?" This was what Merton was in quest of, when Lilia called him back, which excited Harriette's wrath when our story commenced; and Harriette recalled her mother's words on that occasion- "never condemn precipitately." At Dr. Clayton's marriage with Miss Julia Monkton, Grace was present with a winged caterpillar, whom she after- wards wedded, through her mother's influence. In conclusion, dear reader, we will only say that the unions of Grace and Clara made them feel more keenly-Lilia Rosely's Triumph.  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC8303-00000149"/>  THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.

She was miserably mangled, and her coarse garments crim- soned with the dark tide that-flowed from the wounds, while groans and sobs mingled with the screams of the frightened little ones clustered around her. "Hello I what's the fuss?" squeaked the cracked voice of an elderly gentleman, with an astonishing circumference, and head so small that it looked ashamed of being set up on the conspicuous end of so big a body. His short legs seemed indignant at the little progress they were only capable of- making at each successive stretch, and as if to make amends. for the narrow space to whichi-they were limited by nature, they plied with a velocity that brough:t him to the spot, puffing and blowing like a steam engine.

I I never could forbear smiling at a rotund piece of humanity in big trowsers, with a short neck swal- lowed up by a mammoth coat collar, with a small breastpin in a wide frill, and watch chain, like the Atlantic cable, swinging far below his last vest button, with a-handful of heavy seals, keys and peach-seed baskets, nicely wrought out with a pen- knife, dangling at the end, in the ample folds of his double-fall pants. I'm always reminded, on behold- ing a corpulent frame of bones and sinews, of the Israelites whiping for the flesh pots of Egypt. "Thrown from  the wagon-leg broke- horse skeered by a drunken beast--going to market-- she's done for'--were snatches of information, gathered from the increasing-crowd, as Julia and I turned away from the awful scene, and resumed our evening walk. She was silent and deathly pale, as we rounded the corner of the city garden, and pro- ceeded slowly towards the green banks of the shining Potomac. She was very beautiful--just eighteen, and an. orphan. I wondered, secretly, as I watched her white, lovely face, and large, burning black eyes. I -thought of the poetic sentiment-" a heart to feel for others' woe," as I observed her sorrow-shaded, marble-like brow, and: small, compressed mouth, about which quivered an expression of acute pain. "Do you suffer so deeply for others' misfortune?" I asked with assumed lightness.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER,    301 '-YES!" the little monosyllable was firm as granite and icy as the North Pole. I marvelled at the strange air and tone of the girl. "If you grieve for every calamity you witness in your life-march, you'll have your hands full, and soon be in a strait-jacket with your black curls-cut short off!" "And sooner the better. Lunacy is a night of years, and maniacs sleep through it, free from all sorrow." I crushed down my consternation, and suited my tone to the necessity of the case. "I don't know about that-and if it were true, I hope the Lord will permit me to walk into the un- known land across the mountains of mortalityv with the eyes of my intellect wide open, and not go stumbling through the dark.

"Yes, I love you just as well as though we had been christened at the same font, and taught by the same Gamaliel.

I was perplexed by herunusual seeming, and mentally resolved to: unlock the shut door of that sorrow- filled heart.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    303 We had reached the terminus of our walk, and stood now upon the dusky edge of the Point beyond the Light-house, with the dark purple waters of the Potomac tinged afar with the red sunset rays,- sobbing up from the deep channel, and moaning and rippling among the rocks at our feet. The south winds made slumbrous melody among the thick leaves overhead, and far away flashed out the glittering spires of the various churce steeples in the last feeble spark of the day's extinguished fires. Above, around, beneath, all was subdued tenderness -earth was rocking her tired children to sweet repose, in the soft, curtained cradle of the Night, . with the drowsy chant of the winds and waves for a soothing lullaby. I never could stand in the solemn shadows of closing day, with the slumbrous breathings of in- fant twilight rippling up though the great hush of pensive Nature, without having the lachrymal foun- tain of the soul stirred and shaken up by an indefin- able feeling of sadness. ';--That is not akin to pain, And resembles sorrow, only, As the mist resembles the rain." I sat down on an old mouldering, moss-covered log, upon -the river's rim, and looked away down the wide, watery path cut through green ridges-of grass and bordering trees, with here and there a snow-white hut specking -the distant, hazy banks, to hide the .gathering tears, just ready to drop at the  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC8303-00000153"/> 304   THE DRUNKARDIS DAUGHTER. slightest shifting of the surcharged lids. I did not wish to add to her own heart-heaviness, by a symp- tonm of grief or melancholy in my seeming or tone, and tried to crush back the blinding spray dashed up by the troubled waters of transient feeling.- She nestled down, suddenly, half kneeling, upon a grass-clump beside me; crossed her white' bare arms upon my lap, and laid one round, roseless cheek against my shoulder. The quick action displayed a large, overladen tear, that, breaking from the sustaining lashes, fell heavily upon her hand, splash- ing: the small golden-hooped wrist, as the big drop burst.    - She started nervously, and gave me a wild, search- ing look, then dropping her face upon her arms, burst into a low, heart-mourning cry, mingled with spasmodic sobs and stifled moans. It was all over now-my self-control was scat- tered! to the four winds, and I wilted like the mimosa at the touch of rude hands. But philoso- phy soon came to the aid of second thought, and throwing my head back against an old tree-trunk, I broke into a loud, merrywlaugh. The effect was satisfactory. She lifted her wet face, and wiping off the shining tear-drops, looked her unfeigned astonishment. My assumed gayety was rendered-real by her confounded expression. "If I ever wear a strait-jacket and short hair, it'll be after, you, I'm thinking!" she remarked, dryly.

I saw there was some mystery in the sad affair-something that concerned her person- ally, and my curiosity and interest were aroused. I maintained a lively aspect, to compass the desired end, and lightly responded: "No! your unappreciative soul is at fault. I laughed at that old gentleman with the little head and big chain, and wondered if there were more sympathy under his breast-pin than could be got into the seed-basket dangling by his watch-key!

"Poor child!"--she clasped her slender arms around my waist, and her expressive face told the sympathy of her affectionate soul.

I 'smile at fortune, battle on,' because I know that spangled azure is only a thin veil drawn over the glorious land, where those I love have gone before, and are resting securely from all ' the'ills that flesh is heir to;' and the hope that when the little span of earth-life is measured upon the sands of Time, I shall part that blue veil with my spirit-wings, and pass, through the gate of pearl, to the golden city of the great King, and meet the loved ones safely landed there, never more to be dissevered, makes me laugh at the petty plagues of human probation, and bid defiance to the things that must have an end." "Ah! you have hope for those you love, while I have none!" she hid her white face and sobbed- - "If there were one dear to your heart as its own life-tide, of whom you could cherish no hope in this world nor the one to come, who, though living, is worse than dead-would you smile and philosophize then?" 4' My dear girl, while there is life there-is'hope. I should never despair of a loved one, howeyer degraded and seemingly lost, so long as a spark of vitality glimmered through the windows of the soul's tabernacle, and it is written that- "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners," even the " chief."

If it benefits you half as much as it has me, then bit was not written in vain. I have treasured it up in my Bible as an apple of gold in a picture of silver." "What is it?" "An 'Italian bishop, who had struggled through many difficulties, without repining, and been much opposed without manifesting impatience, being asked by a friend to communicate the secret of his being so happy, replied: 'It consists in a single thing, and that is, making a right use of my eyes.' His friend, in surprise, begged him to explain his meaning. ' Most willingly,' replied the bishop. 'In whatever state I am, I, first of all, look up to heaven, and remember that my first great business is to get there. I then look down upon the earth, and call to mind how small a space I shall soon fill in it. I look abroad- in the world, and see what multitudes are in many respects less happy than myself. And thus I learn where true happiness is placed, where all my cares must end, and how little reason I ever-have to murmur, or be otherwise than thankful. And to listen in this spirit, is:to be al- ways happy."'  "I wish I had your faith, Florence." "You may have as great, if you will." "How?" "Try to believe.

She was the only child of parents that had passed away ere I knew and learned to love her. I waited impatiently for the promised revelation. She was gazing steadily at Venus, lying .round and full in the soft blue folds of slumbrous twilight. "No you wouldn't, Florence." "What?" "Scorn one you once loved, for the sin of inebri- ety."

"In this degenerate age, men estimate character by a cash-balance." IT was a blue and breezy May morning, when Henrv Raymond and his beautiful young bride entered their pretty and pleasant cottage home on street.- It was, indeed, a " sweet home," white and modest in physiognomy, set down amid thick shadow-weaving maples, and clambering vines, that wrought lattice-workaround the cool little portico, and low, wide windows. A snow white paling shut in the grassy, flower-hemmed yard, and beyond the cozy cottage, you might catch, through the dark breezy hall and lace-veiled windows, sweet glimpses of the luxuriant garden, with its winding, pebbly walks and sea of fragrant blossoms floating upon an undulating surface of deep green billowy leaves. Nina R-,mond, the frail bride, was just blushing into womanhood-fair as a lily of the valley, and modest and unassuming as a meek spring violet. Her soft, heavenly blue eyes, clear anrd liquid as a cloudless June sky, looked melting tenderness through long, curving black lashes, upon her hand- some and manly bridegroom, and clustering curls [311] ,'r  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC8303-00000157"/> 312    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHT'IR. of richest hazel hue, rippled in silky clouds over plump shoulders of spotless purity, and round trans- parent cheeks, that wore only the delicate tinge of the wild rose save when sensibility painted them a richer red. Henty Raymond's black eyes grew brighter, and his tall graceful form dilated with proud exultation, as he looked upon the fair prize he had borne off in triumph from so many bold aspirants, richer in worldly goods, but not more noble, than himself. His wooing had been attended by many doubts and fears, owing to ambitious and mercenary parents, and now that the object was attained, he appreci- ated it more fully, because of difficulties he had encountered and surmounted in accomplishing the desired end. Nina's parents, though aspiring and avaricious, were devoted to their beautiful child, and through solicitude for her failing health, the effect of oppo- sition in her dearest desires, they yielded a reluc- tant consent to her marriage with Raymond, and saw her go forth from her early home, to meet tile responsibilities, and perform the duties, of a wife, with no fear for her future happiness, but deep regret that she had not chosen one whose pecuniary circum- stances would have elevated her to a loftier social position. Nina's girl-heart had been won by the no- bleness of Henry Raymond's soul, combined with the beauty of his person and evident devotion, and love in a cottage was far preferable to her pure mind, to splendor of surroundings and unsatisfied affections.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    313 Years passed quietly and prosperously away, and a little trio, of which Mary was the eldest, flitted and frolicked through the white cottage, and tracked the neat flower-beds of the blooming old garden, to the offence of Nina's well developed organ of order. Mary inherited the dark eyes, raven curls and intrepid spirit of her father, and grew, with years, into a beautiful and graceful girl, the admiration of the opposite sex, and envy of her own. Her fifteenth birth-day was celebrated in an elegant mansion, filled with the Elite of the city, in a style comrporting with the wealth and high station of the man who sixteen years previously had wedded the gentle Nina Rivers, to the chagrin of her proud, ambitious parents, simply because of his moderate means. Fortune had smiled upon the man of perseverance and integrity, and the moneyed aristocracy,- who once passed him haughtily by, without deigning even a nod of recognition, now courted his society,- and esteemed it a privilege and honor to enter his stately home upon terms -of friendship and equality. Brainless and soulless, they ran, at the ring of his silver bell, and flattered and fawned-little-souled sycophants, at the shrine of dollars and cents-and tagged behind him everlastingly, like lean dogs scenting a Coat-tail plethoric with some odorous substance calculated to appease insatiable greed. Henry Raymond well knew they worshipped his golden calf, and flocked around him from the seven principles that actuate the meanest of God's crea- tures, viz : five loaves and two fishes--yet met their " :r',  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC8303-00000158"/> 314  a THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGH'tIR. cringing civilities with gentlemanly return, when he would not have trusted them with a half-dime to drop into a contribution box. He looked upon them with supreme contempt, knowing them to be human flies, who swarmed around him merely to suck the sweets of prosperity from his golden cup, and would leave him to famish with hunger, should a shock of adversity devastate his immense posses- sions. Nina's parents now regarded their opulent son- in-law with proud affection; and submitted to -his judgment and suggestions with all the deference that sordid minds ever pay to wealth-- and station. They congratulated themselves upon having yielded their will to her desire, and commended her choice as heartily as they had once opposed it; andi'simply because Henry Raymond, though the same being,  morally and intellectually, had -pried open the +  oaken heart of the world with a wedge of perish- ing gold I Surely, if there is one niche in the torrid zone of Eternity that admits of the superlative degree of the adjective hot, it is reserved, by a just and sin- avenging God, for the mean and contemptible worshippers of Iammon.

Though a public speaker, on patriotic and benevolent occasions, from his youth to the period of his nomination, yet his oratorical powers were never discovered to be of a superior order, until a golden halo, reflected from his accu- mulated thousands of double eagles, encircled his brow, upon which the groveling progeny of Demas had written "THE PEOPLE'S CANDIDATE!" He had been taught " temperance in all things," from early childhood, by a pious mother, and in humble life had faithfully practised her precepts; but during his electioneering campaign, he had con- formed to the custom of the times, and thrown off the restraints imposed through- long and peaceful years, by principle and early instruction. He had even committed some petty absurdities, during partial intoxication, which were received with up- roarious applause, by the money-honoring crowd and 'capital fellow ' ' perfect brick!" three cheers- for Raymondl' ' hurrah!'--burst simultaneously from the admiring audience-while 'put him out F! low rascal!" down with the brute!' greeted another inebriate, from all quarters, on the same, occasion whose seedy coat and caved-in hat evidenced a desti. tution of the means thatjustified the rich man in any ,1 * t' r  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC8303-00000159"/> 316    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. excess and absurdity!

HARLES PERCY was the only son of the opu- J lent citizen who manifested so great solicitude. for Mr. Raymond's safety on the occasion alluded to in the last chapter; and as Charles was a suitor for the hand of Mr. Raymond's lovely and wealthy daughter Mary, his consideration and tender care; of the intoxicated father might reasonably be at- tributed to selfish motives, particularly when in that. father's years of poverty, Mr. Percy, senior, had disdained to recognize him as-even a common acquaintance. Indeed, Henry Raymond, in retr0- specting his past life, recalled to memory the time when he had received an indignity from Charles' paternal relative, of mushroom-aristocracy-extrac- tion and belonging, who, ignorant as the beast thiat Baalam rode on his journey to Balak, and of vevy close affinity to said animal in character andde- portment, neglected no opportunity to endeavor to impress an inferior in wealth with an overwhelm-, ing sense of his superiority and grandeur, without an atom of regard for gentlemanly bearingor indi-. vidual feeling.

Mr. Percy's literary attainments had never ex- itended beyond simple division, and Murray's rules for spelling and writing correctly were as much Greek to the purse-proud gentleman, as the commu- nication traced upon a chip was to the aboriginal Indian during the early period of our country's history. His ignorance of Webster, and things "generally," was so intenie and startling, consider- ing his pecuniary circumstances and proud claims to the highest seat in the synagogue of upper ten- dom, that he had absolutely been heard to remark, with all the dignified gravity and importance of a self-sufficient ignoramus; that the situation of a cer- tain patient was utterly hopeless, " as the doctor had positively decided that he had a spine!" And the irrepressible smile that appeared upon Mr. Raymond's fine face, on that occasion, con- duced to the attempted insult (for it was a matter of impossibility to; insult Henry Raymond, who heartily endorsed the sentiment of Cowper: "An honest, liberal, and well bred man, Will not insult me, and no other can," of the poor, intellectual man, from the rich numb- scull. -But now the scorned of other years could com- pete in wealth and magnificence with the mean- minded money-hugger, and he courted and caressed the highly favored son of capricious fortune, with the blissful hope of uniting the two aristocratic houses by the silken cord of matrimony.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGH'TER.   319 Mr. Raymond comprehended his motive, and smiled, pityingly, at the meanness of his sordid soul, yet he was too noble-hearted to suffer the events of the past to interfere with his child's hap- piness, and sanctioned her betrothal to Charles, knowing that her young heart was wholly in the keeping of the estimable son of so stupid and grov- elling a father. Charles Percy was one of those rare specimens of manhood who united personal beauty with high mental endowments. and acquirements, and was as unlike his leaden-brained slovenly progenitor in physique and morale, as it is possible for imagina- tion to conceive. His unpardonable ignorance inspired him with an insatiate thirst for knowledge, and his mean cupidity and sycophancy enlarged and ennobled his young, indignant soul, in exact. ratio with his in- creasing perceptions of the littleness and contempt- ibility of his greedy and grovelling nature. It was a matter of as- much surprise to the discriminating portion of the community, who entertained the be- lief in hereditary transmission, to find one so intel- lectual and estimable spring from so insignificant and morally stunted a stock, as it was to the Israel- ite in whom there was, no guile, to see something good come out of Nazareth. In Charles Percy were developed the higher elements of character, that, by proper culture and judicious training, might have eminently qualified his weak-minded father for the exalted social posi-  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC8303-00000161"/> 320    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. tion to which his wealth alone had elevated him, and which he filled with about as much grace as an ourang-outang would a royal throne. To those who repudiate the doctrine of heredi- tary transmission, a more powerful argument could not be adduced in support of their heterodox views, than the virtues and intellectual superiority of such a son, in striking contrast with the antipodaI char-, acters of such parents, (for Mrs. Percy was the precise counterpart, in mind, of her liege lord, and the only piece of advice she had ever been known to follow faithfully, was "take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves," only Mrs. Percy had improved upon the maxim, and never lost sight of the greater in supervising the less.) What they would have been by mental culture and energetic exercise of the superior order of feel- ings, was demonstrated in their son, for the estab- lished Tact of man's free-agency refutes the argu- ment that human nature is ever so destitute of latent powers and embryo goodness, as to inca- pacitate one of God's creatures-rationally born- from  rising' from the slough of mundane meanness, and cutting its way, heroically, through a phalanx of ignorance and constitutional besetments, with the glittering sabre of moral courage, and intellec- tual might; else " the dear God who loveth, us, who. made and loveth all," were unjust in holding us responsible for what we are incapable of resist- ing or-performing.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    321 Mr. Percy gloried in Charles' triumph over the many suitors of Mary Raymond, and demeaned himself with so much tenderness towards the art- less and credulous girl, that he quite won her young, unsuspecting heart, and her pure love cover- ed his multitude of sins. Had a Gipsey oracle fore- told the agony of soul his hypocritical pretensions and mean cupidity would occasion her in coming years, she would have laughed merrily at the wild and absurd prediction.

Henry Raymond, the gifted and noble-hearted, like thousands who had gone before him, sank lower and lower in the scale of morality and-virtue, as the passion for intoxicating beverages grew upon him day by day. His powers of resistance seemed wholly subverted, and in one year from the day of his nomination, he had acquired the unenviable and shameful reputation of being " a confirmed drunk- ard "  His business -matters ,were confided to i clerks and hirelings, and supervisory neglect speed- ily told a sad tale of his pecuniary affairs.

Others far less substantial, withstood the shock, and looked with amazement upon the mighty wreck of the rich man's shattered barque, drifting upon the subsiding waves of a stringent monetarial epoch; and the last end of Henry Raymond's eighteen years of wedded life was worse than the first. in every point of view--pecuniary, social and  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC8303-00000163"/> 324    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. moral. Mr. Rivers' pride received a stab, by this sad and, sudden reverse of circumstances, from which he never recovered, and as- Mrs. Rivers had passed away in the richest flush of her child's pros- perity, ere long Nina Raymond was parentless and penniless, with a husband whose increasing aban- donment and unkindness, the inevitable result of intemperance, made her weary soul yearn for a quiet resting-place beside them in the sombre grave- yard. The bridal day of Mary and Charles was fast approximating, when the great world was astounded by the unexpected failure of the wealthy and popular Mr. Raymond. Despite his degeneracy in morals, he was still sought and flattered by those who would worship a dime in a den of infamy, but immediately upon his reverse of fortune, like summer birds, they were gone, early, and came no more, with soothing strains of sympathy and friendship, to cheer his winter of poverty. In other years Mr.-Raymond would have smiled with pitying scorn at such an evidence of false- heartedness and sycophancy; but having basked in the golden sunshine of prosperity and -popular favor, and his strong mind having been weakened by dissipation, the sudden shutting in of the great light of social life, and toppling over of lofty posit tion, -operated disastrously upon his shattered nerves, and plunged-him recklessly forward into deeper exchss and degradation. Ah! Henry Ray- mnond had fallen far from the manly height he main-   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    325 tained in early years, when his pecuniary circum- stances were as moderate as now, and lihe went firmly forward in the discharge of duty, regardless of the neglect and indignities of the wealthy and worthless; and all because the venomous WORM of the STILL had sapped the green tree of moral cour- age, and withered the fresh, cool leaves of self-re- liance and inherent energy. Mr. Percy peremptorily forbade his son's union with the bankrupt's daughter, and disinheritance was the promised consequence of filial disobedience; but despite her changed circumstances, Charles Percy, with the soul of a true man, pleaded earn- estly, with all the ardor of a faithful lover, for the performance of her vow made in brighter and better days, when his soulless and sordid father was proud to acknowledge her as the betrothed of -his son. Mr. Raymond stormed at the proposition, and in a state of intoxication ordered Charles from his house, with the furious declaration that "he'd see him in hell before the son of that damned rascal should wed one of his daughters; and he'd k-ick the miserable old money-hugging villain to ever- lasting perdition, if he ever ventured within gun- shot of him, henceforth and forever-the mean old ignorant, grovelling lhypocrite!" He pronounced a fearful curse upon Mary, if she dared to marry in violation of his express com- mands. Mary Raymond had too much pride of nature to  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC8303-00000164"/> 326    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. enter a family opposed to receiving her, and the misery of refusing Charles was added to the great burden of her domestic misfortunes. Believing that circumstances justified the deed, Charles urged an elopement, preferring poverty and obscurity, with the -object of his heart's first affec- tions, to affluence and worldly honor, without her ; buther father's awful curse held her firm to her purpose, and her sobbing refusal, and look- of un- utterable woe, silenced his passionate pleadings. Possessing a soul of intensest feeling, and an organ- ism, one of the most refined and delicate of nature's workmanship, the rude fingers of Fate, grasping the broken buds of his youthful hopes, pressed the slender strings of his mental mechanism too roughly, and soon Charles Percy was borne from his brilliant home, made desolate and  dreary by a father's cupidity, to Mount Hope Lunatic Asylum, from which he has never returned.   CHAPTER V. "The rich man down, you mark his favorite flies." THROUGH the influence of his wife and daughter whom he tenderly loved and caressed as in olden times, when not rendered insane and brutal by the poisonous liquid, Mr. Raymond removed to the country, at length, to escape the irresistible temp- tations that beset him on every hand, in the rum- dealing establishments that disgraced and polluted the place of his birth. For a time high -hopes were -entertained by the little loving home-circle, of his entire reformation, but in an evil hour he fell and shattered: the golden vase that held the brilliant blossoms of sweet anticipation that gladdened anid made happy the domestic hearth. Henry Raymond "resolved and re-resolved? to abandon his pernicious habit, and live henceforth for his heart-broken wife, and pale, toiling chil- dren; but relapse succeeded reform, until mania a potu was the final result of his inordinate indul- gence, and it became absolutely necessary to ren- s rav]  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC8303-00000165"/> 'HE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.  der the Work-House his temporary residence, to obviate fatal consequences in his own humble home. Intemperance effected a perfect transformation of his natural temperament, and- the gentle-souled, tender-hearted, sober Henry Raymond, was con- verted into a " roaring lion, seeking whom he might devour," by intoxication. During a dreadful paroxysm, Nina fled from their poverty-pinched home to the dark woods, in the deep night, with her two little frightened ones, to escape his frantic violence; and they were drenched with a chilly October rain, that laid the foundation of an insidious disease, that ere long sent them all three to the friendly grave, sweetly sleeping side by side, from the sorrows and degradation of a drunkard's home. This great bereavement prostrated the frail form of Mary, and she was borne from the drunkard's hovel to the home of a maternal relative in the city, apparently only to die; but a strong constitu- tion triumphed, and even the blessing of insanity was denied her. But the sweet spring of youth was forever dried in her desolate heart, and no cool gush of pleasant waters has since moistened its parched and thirsty urn. And the great world rolls heedlessly on, nor pauses in its round of gayety and dissipation, to think how desolate and yearning must be the heart robbed in its earliest bloom of girlhood of all the green things that gladden the May-time of life; and only God knows and pities the great agony   that swells and surges in that lonely breast, for the cold world has no sympathy for the poor and suffer- ing. And many a one, blessed with home and friends, murmurs and repines because of some thwarts ed purpose, and bemoans their unhappy lot, as pecu- liarly unfortunate, and themselves as God-forsaken, when the troubles they realize and repine at would be but "trifles light as air," to the crushed and writhing victims of the monster-murderer INTEM- PERANCE. Ah! if those who grieve over adverse fortune, could look down into the arid waste of lives that know real sorrow, how much more gratitude would go up to God for blessings unappreciated, and trampled under the feet of a murmuring and un- thankful world. Mary's proud spirit shrank from dependence upon relatives for subsistence, whose affection would have shielded her from individual exertioi, and her mu- sical accomplishments were brought into requisi- tion to subserve her independence. Mr. Percy, who once petted and praised her, with a greedy eye to her father's coffers, now passed her with a stiff jerk of the head,-meant for an aristo- cratic bow, and coarse grunt of " how-d'e-do" sig- nification, like any other swine. Mary's lip curled with supreme contempt at every sight of the old hoary-headed Shylock, with one foot in the grave, and both avaricious hands clinging tol the golden rails of the world with a desperate, miserly clutch; and memory of the noble lover, buried in the morn. &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC8303-00000166"/> 330    THE DRUNKARIDS DAUGH'TER. ing of his manhood, in a living tomb, by the old miscreant's superlative meanness, filled her heart with doulble-refined hatred for the despicable wretch, and gave her mind a tone of misanthropy that shut her in -from all social intercourse. The death of his wife and children, under the circumstances, stung the soul of Mr. Raymond to remorseful madness, and in a fit of drunken despera- tion, he inflicted a wound upon his person, that confined him long to the poor-house, and had well- nigh proved mortal, and by many who once knew him, he is thought to have died from the insane stab; but a long-suffering God raised him up for some inscrutable purpose, and to-day you have witnessed the result of his restoration to physical strength and access to the intoxicating cup."

The streets of N---.:ere almost deserted as the brother and:- sister wended along in the cold moonbeams :that fell In silver bars upon the pave- ment, between the exfoliated boughs of shivering trees that edged the walk. No sound disturbed the stillness, save afew low echoes of homeward- bound foetsteps. "Where are you taking me, brother?" inquired Eva, as they turned down a dim alley from the lighted way. "To a home of destitution and misery, Eva. To the hearth of the drunkard's wife."

Wilmer cast one glance around, and introducing Eva to Mrs. Winters, disappeared through the door. "Your brother has been very kind, Miss Evylin," said Mrs. W. "But for him and Dr. Ervill I know not what would now be my situation, for comfortless as it no doubt seems to you, compared with the days ere chance gave me their friendship, it is cheerful and happy*.' Eva, who had never before witnessed such desti- tution, found it impossible to restrain her tears, at sight of which the tiny girl crept from the: expiring embers, and- laying her baby cheek upon her moth- er's bosom, put up her round, red lip, and sobbed. in sympathy. There is a voice in tears that tells the whole story of the heart in eloquent and touch- ing language, and- Mrs. W. knew that, in ,Eva Evy- lin, she had found a true and sympathizing friend. "But how long have you known my brother, Mrs. Winters?" inquired Eva, at length. "Two years ago he came to- my desolate home more cheerless than this, and relieved the adistress of a miserable wife, justly expiating the sin of dis- obedience, blinded- by a youthful passion.

Throughl Dr. Ervill,- whom .I met; tii morning, your brother was doubtless ap- prised of my arrival." Wilmer- now  re-entered-the room, followed by Walter Ervill, who started with surprise and colored deeply on seeing Eva. Soon after their entratice'a: woodman supplied the empty fire-place, and a bright blaze sent its genial warmth through- out the apartment. Mrs. Winter's eyes filled with tears of gratitude as she bent them upon the noble' young men, but Walter hid his head behind the- iunni  curls of the little prattling girl, to keep them from Eva;, while the black-eyed -boy was doing his utmost to Full open the fingers of Wil- mer, in order to come; at something which he was assured lay concealed upon the palm. Eva,-wholly unconscious of having inspired Walter With- a sentiment warmer than friendship, felt :addened by his reserve. True, they had met in social --converse but rarely since the school-girl had-merged ---into womanhood; but Eva thought the intimacy and familiarity of youth, with some modifications, might have extended to mature years.     -   -  "My Friend, Dr. Ervill,--informed me to-day of your return, Mrs. Winters.- said Wilmer., but I he :yeLt to learn if your husband is living."

Ah, Mr. Evylin, the world is darkly traduced when they tell us it is all false- hood, selfishness and sorrow." . -- "Those -who assert that, Mrs. Winters,"' said Walter, '4expose the weakness and ignorance-of their own hearts, for the world is arranged in har- mony with all our faculties, the moral sentiments and. intellect holding the- supremacv, and- those who fail to attain what the Creator intended-that is, the gratification of these powers-stamp upon their brow, by the signet of sorrow, non-conformity to His laws. You, madame, wear its impress, but your heart and lip confess that you have infringed those laws, and incurred the penalty of that trans- gression. Had you exercised the powers that God designed to be the guide and control of a being destined to immortality, obedience to their dictates, though adverse to the promptings of nature, would have been attended with a rich reward. Judgment and reason are the only sure -counselIors, and if dis- obeyed, will be avenged-upon the offender.' Wilmer watched narowly the effect of this speech upon Eva, and saw, with pleasure, that her interest was deeply engaged.  ' You reason like my brother, Wal-, Dr. Er- vill," she answered. (She had. almost said Walter, but remembering his reserve, she blushingly made the correction.) "But I cannot -comprehend, she continued, "how Mrs. Winters could foresee that poverty and distress would accrue from her union.' ! ^-  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC8303-00000175"/> 348       EVA EVYIN. "She could not, by possibility, have foreseen such a catastrophe, Miss Evylin, but as 'obedience to eachIlaft is attended with its own reward, and dis- obedience with its own punishment,' she could have foreseen that sorrow and repentance would be the inevitable consequence of setting at defiance parent- al authority." "Parental authority,. reiterated Eva, glancing l inquiringly at Mrs, Wintrs. , Alas, -it is too true, Miss Evylin, that I set at naught a father's superior judgment, and, yielding to a wild and enthusiastic passion, eloped with my husband... -"And do you attribute her present pecuniary condition to that fact, Dr. Ervill?" inquired Eva. "  Pecuniary embarrassments proceed from physic- al causes, Miss Evylin. Her present circumstances, though arrising from that disobedience, are not the direct penalty :of that transgression. Had she wedded- her husband with her father's sanction, and the approbation of the higher faculties, poverty might have overtaken -her, but the sympathetic fibres of: two kindred souls would have gladdened its dim way, for poverty is not sorrow if not the result of propensities that eventuate in shame and self-reproach."  : "But had fortune continued to smile upon them?" said: Eva.   -  :-!

"And is it invariably thhus?" said Eva. "May not a parent err as well as a child?" "Supposing her father actuated by other motives than consideration ' for her' happiness," replied Walter, "his injustice would not have justified her disobedience. And supposing her submissive to his unjustifiable requirements, the consciousness of having sacrificed love-to duty would have conduced to the satisfaction of the higher faculties, and yield- ed a greater degree of happiness than by offending tlhose powers, gratify the inferior feelings."- "The inferior feelings,' repeated Eva, "has affection its origin from thence?---the love of the heart, Dr. Ervill--does your philosophy teach to subvert that?" "The love of the heart, Miss Evylin,  said Walter, in a :voice slightly tremulous, "is the sympathetic influence of two equal powers, acting in perfect harmony, and must, in themselves, become dissatisfied to destroy the affinity of mind'-with mind.  As an illustration, I 'would say, had Mrs. Winters been obedient to her father's demands,:that obedience would have yielded its own reward with- out lessening her affection for the lover so long as  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC8303-00000176"/> 850    -    EVA EVYIN. -her superior faculties received direct gratification from his. To subvert the love of thel heart, the basis upon which it builds must be destroyed, and the fabric will fall and lay its fancied bliss in ruins. The only security is to test the foundation ere it construct, for all is not tlove, Miss Evylin, that bears its semblance."  /Eva glanced towards her brother and saw his eyes fixed approvingly upon the young speaker.

CHAPTER IV. ITME wore away, and the New Year was fast ap- preaching. Wilmer adroitly managed to bring the silent and the avowed- lover, and the- maiden, frequently together, that Eva might perceive the contrast. He also drew forth Walter's' eloquent and poetic powers, that some times startled the no less the poetic Eva, by its brilliant and- chaste beauty. She would sit, at night-fall, and hear him descant upon the glories of the Spirit-world, till fancy flew above the stars and gazed upon its splendor, so vividly was it portrayed; but let the proud and stately Herbert Henley enter the- hall and ' all was earth again," so powerful is a first passion!          ' Herbert really loved Eva with all his capacity, the very fact of which would have rendered her more wretched, by an alliance. The most: vicious men seek an amiable and virtuous 'wife, thus dis- closing their appreciation of that with which they themselves are unimbued; forgetting, in the im- potence of their nobler faculties,- that the very principles of which they are enamored, would- con- duce to indifference in the possessor, when repulsed by their own unsympathizing propensities, which [851]  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC8303-00000177"/> 352o       EVA EVYIN. indifference would excite jealousy, in the least ' worthy, that seed of death, " sown in weakness, and raised in power!" Eva passed many pleasant hours in the society of Mrs. Winters. Walter encouraged- the intimacy, knowing that Mrs. Winters was well qualified to excite, rather than suspend the activity of the finest Sensibilities.   ' : The unfortunate widow at length confided to her youngE friend the sad story of her past life, only reserving some truths that can npver find way from the heart's secret depths; for the heart mayv grow cold and estranged from- the -object that once thrilled it with fond affection, but the lips must for - ever be sealed to the unworthiness of one we have loved. Flora Wilton was the only child 'of wealthy and indulgent parents. At the early age of fourteen, death deprived her of a mother's love and care, and the whole wealth of a father's heart, centred upon hionly tie to earth. In-, bestowing upon her every accomplishment, necessary to fashionable life, the cultivation of the mind was forgotten, and the dark billows of, that neglect, rolled back, in after time, upon the heart of the deserted father. Two years from  her mother's death, Flora gave her heart to' Harry Winters, a handsome stranger, touring through the States, to whom her father objected, on the plea that knowledge of cha-  racter was indispensable, to obtain his sanction to his daughter's union.  *v, J         ,   ,           .   EVA EVYIN.       353 Flora, unaccustomed to opposition, eloped with her passionate lover, and they were married I Mr. Wilton died, soon after the consummation, forgiving his erring child, and bequeathing her his whole possessions. Had Harry Winters realized her every anticipation, the memory of- that fond, indulgent father's cold, white face and shrouded form, would have left in the heart of that disobedient daughter, and too late repentant wife, a life-long agony. Winters proved to be a penniless wanderer and professional gambler. Flora loathed the principles of her husband, but the mother's heart preferred sharing the father's degradation, to deserting that husband and father with all his contemptible vices, for there is a tie in maternity, it is said, that nought can sever. Mr. W.'s strides to ruin were rapid and reckless. With the hope of retrieving what he had already lost, in a state of blissful intoxication, he staked his remaining all, and a single cast of the die beggared his helpless wife and innocent babes. The friends of his prosperous hours fled like sum nr birds before the winter's gloom, and the keenest poverty, and wretchedness was the award of. his crimes. It was in this state that Walter was. called to attend the miserable wife, while the brute- of a husband, the author of all-her destitution, lay upon the bare floor in a trance of beastly- intoxication.

"had the son of him who won my husband's wealth, been as noble a soul as your brother and Dr. Ervill,? Eva,?' said Mrs. W., in cncluionlusion, I might-yet enjoy days of peace and plenty." "' And will he not assist you, Mrs. W.?" asked the thoughtful girl'. Has he not a heart of suffi- cient flexibility to compassionate, and relieve the wants of an injured wife, wronged by his own father?  l'Hie tells me that he is not answerable for the deeds of that father," said Mrs. W. "I have little hope for mercy at his hands, though the amendment of those wrongs would little impair his immense wealth..l Herbert H-enley, though a brilliant star in the gay world, is sadly deficient at heart h Eva turned deathly pale at that name, and com- plaining of indisposition, returned home in a state of m'ental agony. Wilmer rose, smilingly, as she etered; and throwing herself wildly upon his bosom,: the poor girl wept long and passionately. Tenderly he inquired- the cause of her distress but promising toreveal all in the future, she retired to her chamber to weep over her disappointment.- ' Wilnmer's distress was no ways inferior to his- sisfer's, and learninglfrom her maid that she had visited -Mrs. Winters, he was s0on standing beneath her roof, and gathered- from the grateful widow'the source-of Eva's unhappiness, in" the recapitulation ,of the conversation.

The hour for- con- fession had come, and Wilmer seated himself beside the pale Eva, and drew her young head upon his manly bosom. Thus they sat months agone; and what had the intervening period brought of joy or woe? All the hopes of a brother's heart hung upon the developments of that narrow space of time. Silently they sat, till -a low sob from Eva told that the past was fraught with sorrow and disappoint- ment. "My sister," he said, trembling, ":have you dis- covered aught in the character of Herbert Henley, to awaken regret'?" "I have Wilmer," replied Eva, lifting her tearful eyes to his; "and now, brother, recur nomore to the past. I :will never wed him as he is, but I can never love-another"    - "'I am no 'prophet, nor the son of a: prophet,' Eva," said Wilmer, making an effort to :cheer her sadness, " but, if I. should predict I would yet give (355) r.  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC8303-00000179"/> 356-       EVA EVYIN. -our little heart a victim to Cupid, and make it believe it had never loved by once." "Never, Wilmer, never. I can love no more." 'The heart that once truly loves never forgets;  But as truly loves on to the close: As the sunflower turns qn her god when he sets, The same look that she gave when he rose.'" "Hearts united by mutual sympathy will never forget, Eva, though distance forever divide them: but the heart, rudely repulsed -by uncongeniality, like the vine around the lightning-seared oak will fade and fall away, yet leave the germ unscathed. But tell me, sister, with the knowledge that you possess of Herbert Henley, do you love him yet?"  Eva hid, her face and was silent. Her higher  feelings -clashed with the inferior, and nature warred with judgment. Her trusting heart had invested Henley with every perfection;. and now that the weil tas lifted, and reason looked upon his deformed principles, still the tendrils of passion clung tena- ciously -around her first fancy. In proportion as the heart is easily ensnared, without the interven- tion of judgment, is it loth to relax its hold when intellect comes in to dispel the-illusion;i for the preponderance of propensities that urged it blindly onward, though restrained by the perceptive powers, hold in check the superior feelings, and leave i; to alternate between desire and will. A supremacy of superior :feelings, had Eva possessed it, would :hae held in abeyance the inferior, and permitted a . i      EVA EVYN.        357 her to resign Herbert Henley with less violence to "her faculties, now that the higher were offended. As the shades of twilight deepened, Henley was announced at Loveland, and ushered into the pre- sence of Eva. She rose to receive him, pale but calm, to an observer, yet mentally there was a struggle for mastery. A soft flush suffused her fair face as she met the smiling eye of the object of her first sweet dreams, but it quickly faded away be- neath the snow of her young cheek. Wilmer rose and left the hall, and Herbert availed himself of the opportunity offered, to again urge Eva to decide his fate. In a voice low and trembling, despite her efforts to subdue emotion, she gently but firmly declined the honor of his hand. Henley started, colored deeply, then became deathly pale. All the weak-- ness of the young girl's nature defied restraint as lie clasped her hand passionately, and bending over gazed wonderingly, yet mournfully, in her blue eyes, and yielding insensibly to his embrace, she sobbed hysterically upon his bosom. "Eva, I fancied I had awakened an answering echo in your heart, or I should not have subjected myself to the humiliation of this hour. Have I been deceived, dear Eva, in believing that you loved me?t "; I have loved you, Herbert," replied the maiden, rallying, and withdrawing from the arms of -her lover . "And how have I forfeited that love, Eva?"  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC8303-00000180"/> EVA EVYIN.  With a mighty effort she summoned resolution to confess, that though her heart urged acceptance; she rejected his hand from conviction that happi- ness-c6uld not be long realized in an alliance where dissimilarity of disposition was so apparent. Hen- ley was confounded. He had hot dreamed that the Volatile and impulsive Eva could be controlled by rigid calculating judgment. " Andwill you lay the heart a sacrifice upon the altar of false philosophy ?"  : "It is not false philosophy Herbert. If similar- ity of, mind is necessary to the support of love, it were better, far, to 'part now in amity, than by uniting ':moulder piecemeal upon the rock' of dis- sension and discord." "You have never loved as I have, Eva," he said, bitterly," or you could not thus crush my dearest hopes."- "'-he! future must test that, Herbert. You know my motive for refusing my hand against the plead- ings .of my heart, Time will tell the depth and purity of your own affection." Hrberbert Henley left the hall, that ,night, with a heart, oscillating between love and pride. "To be rejected by her," he soliloquized, " when others far more lovely, and equally as gifted, would proudly wear the name of Henley." H'lEerbert was not deficient in intellect, and secret- lyiconfessed the wisdom of Eva's decision; and but for his indomitable pride, which he strove not to control, he might yet' have won her hand, but his   I   -j   EVA EVYLIN.               359 self-esteem took alarm, and in four months he was united to the beautiful heiress of Colonel Elton, of N Eva, as the intimate friend of Ella Elton, was chosen bridesmaid. She deliberated long, with regard to accepting the invitation, but virtuous pride came in to the aid of weakness, and she re- solved to go. "He shall see that I am capable of supporting what I have advanced ,nshe .said mentally.  " He shall not triumph if appearance; can-deceive; and yet, am-I equal to the effort ?" she asked herself. " Well has Byron sung  'Pride may cool what passion heated, Time will tame the wayward will; But the heart in friendship cheated, Throbs with woe's most madd'ning thrill.' He never loved me, or he could not so soon have forgotten. And should I not feel grateful for such an escape?  But, after all," she ejaculated, ' has he not cause for righteous indignation, to be discarded from so poor a plea?  What knows the heart of reason?   Can philosophy school it to apathy ? I know he is deficient in the noblest prin- ciples of human nature, but, I love im yet I and I can never love another. But I have sealed my own fate, and pride must bear me out. Oh, brother, your philosophy has destroyed my every hope." With such reflections she arrayed herself for the trying scene. "You look so pale, Missis," said her maid.

Eva, though unaccustomed to sporting false hues, wishing -to conceal her own weakness, yielded to her maid's entreaties, and a soft tinge added lustre to her flashing eyes. Accompanied by Wilmer and Dr. Ervill, who -fancied she had never appeared more gay and lovely, she sprang into the carriage, and was soon set down at the brilliant mansion of Col. Elton. Firmly,.yet with a palpitating heart, she ascended to the bride's apartment to await the appearance of the groom, Soon the door was thrown back, and the lovely Herbert Henley en- tered, and sat down, smiling, beside the blushing Ella. Glancing around upon the train, his dark eye fell full upon the bright blue ones of Eva. A rich flush mantled his brow as he recognized her w-ith a slight bow -of ease and grace, Eva returned it- with calm and cool politeness. Walter felt her slight form quiver, as she leaned upon his arm in the crowded hall, and the words were spoken, "I, Herbert, take you, Ella, to be my wedded wife, to love," but no emotion was visible in :her smiling, -glowing face. Thus may the heart hide behind the veil of seeming. 'Eva was: -an accomplished pianist and sweet vocalist, and during the evening was frequently called upon for a song, which request she as often declined, tilloHenley united his importunities. "He is unfeeling," she said mentally, ' and exults in my incapacity. I will- teach him otherwise;"   EVA EYVYIN.         361 and taking the arm of Walter, she stepped lightly across the hall and sat down to the piano. A faint- ness came over her as her hands swept the keys and preluded the air, but the knowledge that his ear was attentive, gave her strength, and in a voice sweet and clear, yet slightly tremulous, she sang -the touching lines of Charles Jeffreys :- "Oh I take her, but be faithful still, And may the bridal vow Be sacred held in after years, And warmly breathed as now. Remember, It is no common tie That binds her youthful heart; 'T is one that only truth should weave And only death can part.

And may your days-glide sweetly on In happiness and peace." Her voice, which had become faint, as she pro- ceeded, suddenly rose, lute-like and thrilling, and in a firm, distinct tone, she repeated the last stanza, and turned her smiling eyes upon the wedded pair. Ella answered her with a loving glance, but Her- bert gazed earnestly into their azure depths, while a shade of thought flitted across his handsome face. Eva observed the change, and pitied the' trusting bride. 16  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC8303-00000182"/> 362        EVA EVYIN. "How unworthy," she thought, "to peril her happiness in seeking to be revenged upon me," and with a deeper insight into the character of him who had inspired her young heart with a first passion, she returned home, more aiive to the uncertainty of Ella's future happiness than her own disappoint- ment.  But I can never love again," was the sym- phony to all her train of meditations. Eva" felt confident of that. She had been deeply, darkly dis- appointed, and she resolved in her heart, never to trust more. CHAPTER   VI. ALMLY, yet very pale, she wandered through the silent halls of hqr lonely home, and amid the opening blossoms of the young spring. Wilmer's watchful eye saw her slowly fading, day by day, and every means thatlove could devise was resorted to in order to beguile her silent sorrow. Walter was her daily companion,--Wilmer alleging that the declining health of his sister required his careful at- tention. Eva learned to watch for his foot-fall; and the young physician experienced an exquisite thrill of joyful hope as he met her welcome smile. Walter had broken through all restraint from the , hour they met at Mrs. Winters'.

Disease bad not impair- ed her physical constitution, but an aching void within the heart had worn upon and prostrated her nervous system,and she lay in infant helplessness. Walters skill was brought in requisition to strengthen and invigorate the mental functions; and watchfully and tenderly he lingered beside the pale young sufferer. It was a lovely, balmy evening in' June. The breath of summer parted the light drapery and swept into thesick chamber, dalling with the brown curls that lay in dishevelled beauty around the calm, white face of the slumbering Eva. 'Wal- ter Ervill entered noiselessly and bent over the beloved sleeper. "Lovely, ardent girl," he murmured, "the world were nought compared with the love of that heart," --and in the ardor of his own, he softly pressed his ips to her unconscious brow. A hand was laid gently upon his arm; he started, turned and crim- soned on beholding Wilmer. "You love her, Walter?" said the brother. "Forgive my temerity, Wilmer," replied the young physician. "I do love her. I have loved her from childhood, but never till this hour berayed that affection." -  .  "  * :. ^   &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC8303-00000183"/> 364     -  EVA EVYIN. "My sister's happiness is dearer to me than aught else, Walter. Win her heart, and, to you I will en- trust the keeping of that happiness with joy and confidence." Ervill grasped the hand of the noble brother, and turned- hastily away to suppress- his deep emotion. From that hour their hearts mingled in mutual sympathy and interest. In two weeks Eva was permitted to descend to the parlor, though pale and feeble. With the flight of time health returned, and with it cheerful- ness-though unlike the sprightly gayety of the maiden of bygone hours. There was now a sedate, thoughtful dignity in her deportment that repelled lightness, and her demeanor towards her brother indicated the purest love and deference; for Eva had learnedIto respect his judgment. Often she met Henley, who strove to engage her attention; but calmly and coldly, yet with smiling politeness, she eluded his efforts. Wilmer observed her acute- ly, and his eyes sparkled with pride and pleasure at the display of her indifference.   4;:   CHAPTER    VII. rWELVE months had gone, and summer came again.  Eva's cheek had grown bright, and her smile sunny as of yore, but her heart wandered away to all the beautiful of earth, and Walter almost despaired of ever imprisoning it in his own bosom. The destitute ever found a friend in {the gentle and benevolent girl, who truly sympathized with every sorrowing heart, and in administering to the happiness of others, Eva secured her own; and Wilmer's philosophy had accomplished this. "How ill Mrs. Henley looks," said Walter, as Ella departed after having passed an hour at Love- lands. "Her health is very precarious, she tells me," ans;wered Eva, glancing involuntarily towards- her brother. "She and Mr. Henley leave for Saratoga to-morrow." ' !"I trust it may not be in ,vain," said Wilmer. "The blooming Ella Elton can scarcely be recog- nized in the pale and dejected Mrs. Henley."; Eva remained silent, and sedulously avoi. her brother's eye. They had never spoken of tf past since the hour of confession, and she felt averse- to :*   -(365) \   '    ' / - *:  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC8303-00000184"/> 366        EVA EYYIN. prolonging a theme that revived therecollections of that. - Walter here proposed a ride ; and equipping her- self in an equestrian habit, they swept down the busy thoroughfare and emerged   into the fresh breezes of the cool, free woodlands. "How beautiful," cried Eva, with enthusiasm, as she gazed upon the flowery wild: " well has Cole- ridge said: ' Methinks it should have been impossible, Not to love all things in a world so filled; Where the breeze warbles, and the mfte still air Is music slumbering on her instrument.'  Walter turned his expressive eyes upon the fair girl, .and answered, in the language of Wordsworth, "Nature never did betray The heart that loved her. " Eva, met his earnest gaze, and slightly coloring, replied, with affected lightness : * "No, Walter; and why should we turn from all At:he beautiful and true to give its treasured worth to a mortal, changeful thing. Oh! give to me the full,:freel soul that spreads its spirit wings and circles all, spurning the fetters that would enslave it to an object subject to the sad reverses that Byron so touchingly bewails: 'Oh, would it were my lot To be forgetful, as I am forgot.'" "Biut the heart must have sympathy, Eva,"  said Walter. "The Creator has implanted a principle   EVA EVYIN.       367 within it whose natural tendency is to meet and commingle with a kindred spirit; and though we love and trust, and are deceived, yet will we trust again, and how blessed a thing it is that our souls are so constituted." "You know I never question'the truth of any assertion of yours," said his companion, smiling; "but I have yet to be convinced ofthat ; for I have loved and been deceived, Walter," she added, con-i fidingly, " and I fancy I can never trust again." But for the shade that deepening twilight threw along their way, the colorless cheek of Ervill would have betrayed his heart to the artless and unsus- pecting girl. He soon mastered his feelings ; and from a desire to spare her the pain of knowing the sorrow she had occasioned, answered, "We tan truly sympathize, dear Eva, for I, too, have experienced a- heart-disappointment, and can never love another."  i"Say not so," said she, affected by his sad tone, "' though deceived yet will we trust again.' " "I have not been deceived," he replied. "She ;: was worthy, but gave to another the heart from - which the tendrils of mine can never be dissevered." Eva lifted her eyes to the tiara of stars that glittered upon the brow of young night, and Walter saw that they were liquid with tears of sympa- thy. "I never look upon the spangled heavens," said she, mournfully, "without recalling the lines of poor Byron :-  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC8303-00000185"/> 368        EVA I;VYIN. "Tis night when meditation bids us feel  We once have, loved, tho' love is at an end; The heart, lone mourner of its baffled zeal Tho' friendless now, will dream it had a friend.'" Walter exerted his powers to revive her droop- ing spirits, and, never unsuccessful, she alighted at Lovelands smiling and cheerful. CHAPTER VIII. ANOTHER year rolled away, and Eva was still the free-hearted; happy maiden. Lovers bowed at her shrine, but left untouched her heart, and the gay world whispered, "she is invulnerable"-but some asserted that Walter was the chosen. Eva laughed at Madame Rumor, and informed her she felt no disposition to quit the pleasant shores of celibacy and launch out upon the uncertain sea of matrimony. True, Walter was her constant attend- ant-for with him she was ever happy. He could soothe her chafed spirit in hours of sadness, and lull her restless thoughts upon the Aide of his deep eloquence,- but it was the love of a Slster's heart the maiden gave to the silent lover. Walter was -happy in the society of the loved one, yet despaired of making her his own. But Wilmer was more san- ' guine. It was a pleasant eve in the autumn time, peculiar only to te stheh ou th, when the last roses of summer give their wasting perfume to the low winds as   EVA EVYIN.        369- they rustle through the fading garniture of nature, making soft music with its flutterings. Ervill had not visited Lovelands during the day, and Eva re- clined within an open lattice, gazing out upon the night-shades, murmuring:  "Why don't he come? Ive watched afar, By the feeble light of yon glimmering star, Till my weary eyes grow faint and dim, And yet thro: the mist I trace not him." "Why does not Walter come?" she -said, aloud, to Wilmer, who sat with an open volume before him, seemingly absorbed, yet, in- reality, watching with pleasure her attitude and anxiety. He strove to suppress the glad smile that longed to leap out upon his lip, and answered, soberly and carelessly, "His professional duties have, perhaps, detained him." A step was heard in the hall, and Eva's eyes grew bright-as the night-lamp revealed the tall, fine form of the young physician. His face was very pale, but the sunshine of a loving heart irradiated it as he received the maiden's welcome. "Truant," she said playfully, as he gently pressed her extended hands--"l why have you remained so long away? I was growing dull and spiritless, for some wretched fairy has run off with brother's phil- osophic heart, and my 'pent-up' thoughts were .be- coming restless, for Dr. Young says, 'thoughts pent  up want air.'7  Wilmer and Walter exchanged smiles, and the latter repeated: 16'.  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC8303-00000186"/> 370       EVA EVYIN, "I have been necessarily detained, Eva, or I should ere this have luxuriated in your smiles; and yet the pleasure I now enjoy renders me more sen- sible of the truth of your author's assertion that- ' blessings brighten as they take their flight.'"  Eva looked earnestly and inquiringly at the thoughtful speaker, and he continued--"I have but come to say farewell, dear Eva,; to-morrow I go to the far West, perhaps to be absent long." "Eva's cheek grew white as the rose-bud half buried amid her curls!, and she turned silently away. Wilmer smiled significantly upon the lover, whose face glowed with the rapturous emotions that quivered in his heart; and whispering the brother, who retreated noiselessly from the room with a heart exulting in his sister's distress, he approached the casement and stood beside the maiden. His eyes followed hers, and fixing them upon the stars he Sbftly -repeated:  "'Tis night when meditation bids us feel, tWe once have loved, though love is at an end." She turned involuntarily and met his joyous smile. "Dear Eva," he said, "can you- yet make a self- appropriation. of that sentiment?" She blushed and-trembled, but:remained silent. "I once told you," he continued--" that I had experienced a heart-disappointment, and that I could never love another; my heart has known no change, for I love, nay, idolize her yet; but Eva, dear E:va,"-and his arm stole around her slight form-" myfirst, my only love is here."   EVA EV Y I1.      ,"' She started convulsively;, a rich glow overspread her white face, and laying her cheek confidingly upon his bosom, the trembling maiden wept Wal- ter's arms closed fondly around her, and bending his lip to the half-exposed brow, he softly asked- '"You love nme, Eva?"She raised her blue eyes to his, and answered fervently-"I do love you, Wal- ter!" He pressed her closely to his heart, and the pent- up love of years found vent in the simple words, - ' My own!" 'Twas night again, and the mansion at Lovelands was brilliantly illuminated. Fair forms thronged j the halls, and a buzz of expectation wavered throughout the assembly. "Behold, the bridegroom cometh," cried a light- hearted maiden, as a white train entered and the company rose. They were a lovely pair. Walter, with his tall, fine form and beaming blue eyes, through which the gentleness of the soul looked forth :-a bright flush was on his cheek, that swept upward and gradually melted away in the purity of his broad manly brow, that softened in the shade of dark chestnut curls- and Eva, with her delicate form robed in simple white. A trusting smile was on her lip, and her azure eyes looked lovingly up in Walter's bending ones as she answered distinctly-"I will."  Two years have gone since then. Eva accorm :: panied Walter to the far West, and returned to witness the nuptials of the noble Wilmer, who was  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC8303-00000187"/> 3w2:      EVA EVYINT. happily wedded, and adopted the bright boy of Mrs. Winte'e, who bids fair to be as great a philos- opher: as his benefactor. Mrs. Winters has learned to smile again; and the prattling girl causes the happy home of Ev-a to ring with silvery music. Herbert Henley is yet the proud, sordid lover of gayety and fashion, and Ella the pale, thoughtful wife. Walter often steals noiselessly in to watch the rosy Si ibers of a tiny cherub, with all a father's love and pride, and Eva still blesses the hour that gave her to the arms of her noble and idolizing husband.  f    THE GEM; OR, THE CHARM THAT WINS.

Had you seen her last night, as I did, kneeling beside a bed of straw, ministering to the wants of a dying child, when she thought that no eye save His who never sleeps witnessed the outpourings of her noble and generous nature, you could not but confess that pure and holy feelings may dwell in a heart that lies enshrined within a bosom of so cold an ex- terior.

"But pray, explain the cause of this sudden trans- ition, cousin Sarah--I do not comprehend?" "Well, Kate, his gift signified 'disappointed hopes.'" "Oh, I understand you now--he must have been a 'i/heartless' creature to have presented that to her." "Yes, indeed, but such is frequently the result of insensibility and indiscretion, and being sadly defi- cient with respect to both of these qualities, and his little soul being piqued at her distribution,.he awoke a fount that for a moment swept away the ; veil that hid, her heart-from the eye of the world.

To the two gentlemen he gave a geranium oak, which signified 'true friendship,' and called forth great acknowledgments 'from Mr. Loland, whose beauty was wholly lost on Nancy's 'jejune powers of rati- ocination.'

"Yes, Kate; and thus it is with many human beings--you pass them by unnoticed, because of their plain appearance, until your hybiscuses and hollyhocks and primroses have disappeared in the winter of adversity, which only serves to reveal their concealed merit." "Well, don't preach now, cousin, but tell me the result of this singular selection of Mr. Melville." "Well, as you may suppose, it elicited ejacula- tions of surprise from the party, whose secret, astonishment exceeded their involuntary tmanifes- tation, when they saw the' cold,' 'stupid' Edith's hand tremble and a tear fill her eye as she received itifio-n him."

THE OHARM -TAT WINS.     a408 She turned a deaf ear to all cries but those of the poor and needy, and many were the young voices and tearful eyes that hailed her approach with gladness. She often met Melville at the bedside of the sick and the dying, and as his deep, manly voice went up to the ' Giver of all good,' in behalf of the afflicted, she regarded him as a brother, in her love for the good' and noble, almost doubting that the fall of man from his high estate, extended to so true an image of his Maker. Consequently, entertaining such views of his superior merit, she avoided him not as others of his sex, and their united efforts soothed many an aching heart, and- lighted with joy many a dimmed and hollow eye.; thus :strengthening, by daily intercourse, which only served to adduce incontestfible proof of his genuine piety, the sisterly regard that had sprung up spontaneously in her bosom for him; but Edith never dreamed of Wilmot in any other light than that of a br6ther." It was a sweet evening in June, that Melville and Edith were wending their way slowly towards the deep old woods wheroe;two years before he had presented her the coriander.
