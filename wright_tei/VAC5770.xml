            <head>PREFACE.</head> 
            <p>FROM that eventful period in the history of the world, when the Roman Hierarchy assumed that St. Peter ascended the Papal throne, to the present time, there has been no era unmarked by the superstitions of that System. Within the last two hundred years, the onward march of intelligence has, however, in some degree, robbed it of its worst features, and reason and tolerance have taken their places; the savage passions that drove nations to unprecedented extremes have become more enlightened; but where they have grown less civilized, they have shrank away to hide their deeds in darkness. Great truths are learned from history, some of which inform us by what bold impiety, Popes and Kings have caused the greatest misfortunes to Europe during eighteen hundred years of tyranny and fanaticism; and others again exhibit to us that, "The pride of the Popes and their insatiable ambition, found in absolute monarchs powerful and frequently docile auxiliaries," in imposing upon the people their mandates, in overwhelming the weak, in aggrandizing their estates; and, at last, arrogating to themselves the vicegerancy of God! Everywhere throughout the nations subject to the commands of the Romish See, ignorance reigned supreme; systems of torture were publicly established and sanctioned in nowise compatible<pb n="xii-xiii" xml:id="VAC5770-00000006"/> ble with the injunction of Revelation which says: "THOU SHALT NOT KILL!" If a liberal sentiment arose in the universal heart, it was suppressed by thunders from the Vatican; if a desire for general information was observable among the people, the holy aspiration was checked by anathemas from the Papal throne; if thoughts of freedom were promulgated, they were outraged by censorial supervision; in short, all conditions of life, with the noble impulses of the heart, were made subservient to the Prelates and Dignitaries who surrounded the Chair of St. Peter!</p> 
            <p>Modern times have not been exempt from the influences of these intolerant dogmas. As this System was eighteen hundred years ago, so is it now. The light of intelligence, it is true, has circumscribed its sphere of action, and built up systems which encourage free thought and religious toleration; but wherever Papal tyranny treads, wherever its hand is seen, liberty to think and speak shrinks back aghast, and Mercy weeps over its decimating trail. Public exhibitions of its power are somewhat modified; but in its persecutions it is no less rigorous. Secret and insidious in its movements it presses forward, appearing externally, like "whited sepulchres," while within bleach the decaying bones of butchered thousands, and pale the cheeks of youthful innocence and manly integrity. The old countries experienced, and still suffer by its poisonous breath-but the march of Science and Literature has circumvented much of its intolerance and persecution. The hand of Liberalism has silenced, in a measure, the terrors of the Vatican, and Inquisitorial exhibitions have met religious Protestant condemnation. The rotten<pb n=""/> foundation of the System is tottering in the East, and with longing eyes and anxious hearts, its leaders are looking to our own happy country for a place of refuge-in which they design, at no distant day, if successful, to set up the Papal See-locate the Chair of St. Peter-and establish the Popish throne! To this end, secret associations have been formed-private councils held-unholy schemes devised-and sacrilegious plottings matured, to subvert liberty of speech, religious toleration, freedom of the press; and to destroy the only Republican Government in the world! The Serpent which the people have warmed into vitality has turned upon its benefactors to sting them unto death; and, conscious that its power, when publicly exhibited, is insufficient to destroy the mighty structure Christianity and Freedom have reared, its only hope of success lies in poisoning our domestic circles, our politicians, and our institutions!</p> 
            <p>It is well to search out the cause that produces the unhappy differences existing among us, in order that we may strike at the root of the evil-at the cause that produced the effect-which arraigned man against his brother with drawn sword, in hostile array. It is well to allay a popular tumult; but it is better to go to its fountain and remove the cause that produces it. Until this is done-until freemen shall recognize and place their ban on the further progress of their foe, America will weep over effects far more fearful than those which called into being the American Republicans.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>INTRODUCTORY.</head> 
               <p>THE public are so accustomed to have descriptions of persons and times so deeply enveloped in the mystery of the past that, not one of the actors of those periods live to controvert a sentiment or action wrongly ascribed to them, that doubts have arisen whether a tale related of events so recent that many of the characters in it still survive to peruse its pages, would find a welcome in the hearts of the people, as free and warm as that accorded to its mystery-clouded, but perhaps less truthful contemporaries.</p> 
               <p>There was a time, years ago, when, from the Arctic to the Southern Ocean, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, not an European could be found on this continent. In those times, in Europe, men were burnt, impaled alive, and doomed to wear out their lives in loathsome dungeons, if suspected of entertaining religious or political sentiments different from their rulers, while on those dearer than life<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5770-00000008"/> to them,-their defenceless wives or children,-their tormentors exhausted their inventive powers to heap new indignities and outrages, to escape from which they welcomed death as their only haven of refuge. Justice had indignantly taken her flight from the scenes of such cruelty, while Mercy, with bowed head, and her white wings trailing in blood-bedewed dust, wandered a fugitive, though her mournful cry of "Spare them! spare them!" never ceased.</p> 
               <p>In those ancient days of horror a ship, laden with humanity, left her ensanguined shores to seek safety among the savages of America, who were less cruel than their brothers. This ship was the May-Flower, and bravely, nobly, did she bear her precious freight, which was to be the germ from which sprang the freest nation on the earth. This crew of hardy pioneers landed on Plymouth Rock, and there, with the primitive gigantic forest towering above them, while savages and beasts of prey lurked around in its shades, they consecrated themselves and the land they proposed to subdue to liberty, freedom, and a refuge for the oppressed. Here man gradually resumed his dignified position, each individual being on an equality with his brother in rights and rank, strove to excel in virtue. Thus they grew strong in noble deeds as they grew strong in numbers, until the American colonies had swelled to three millions of souls-of freemen.</p> 
               <p>The countries that drove them forth stood aghast-three millions of freemen had arisen, as if by magic, from the<pb n=""/> fruits of their tyranny at home, and they resolved to force them back to the chains that had so galled their ancestors. But it could not be-bravely the freemen defended their right to live, and think, and act as their consciences dictated, acknowledging no allegiance but to the soil on which they were born, and to the God who made them. The hoards of hireling serfs that had been sent to wrest from them their liberty, were driven back to their masters, while the shouts of the victorious freemen rose and swelled until the glad sound was heard in the remotest corner of the earth.</p> 
               <p>Many attempts were made after this to enslave these sons of the hardy pioneers, but with "God and Liberty" for their war-cry, they were invincible.</p> 
               <p>Then the tyrants of the old continent trembled, for the new world was yearly growing stronger; aye, she even now defied her whole powers combined to reduce her free-born sons to the serfdom of her own people. One of these, whose throne was built of the gold coined from the blood of his martyred people, turned with longing eyes to this new continent. His power was waning in the old; aye, his days were already numbered, and he purposed to abandon his tottering throne and rear a new one on the new continent. This could not be done by force, but strategem might succeed. Accordingly his emissaries, laden with the poisons that had desolated Europe and clothed in the garb of peace, flooded every mountain and vale where a freeman had reared his cottage-smiling softly winningly<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5770-00000009"/> ningly, treading noiselessly, but leaving a slimy track behind to show the path of the reptile, The specious covering did not hide from the sight of our ancestors the loathsome trail. Washington's eye was upon it, and he said to those who confided and looked to him for succor in time of need, "Against the insidious wiles of Foreign Influence the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake. It is one of the most baneful foes of a republican government." Hordes of serfs, under the guidance of their masters, were transported to the land of freedom, to poison its fount still deeper, by their example. The poison worked and rankled among the hireling crew, but the free-born sons of the pioneers stood firm and invincible. The beacon-like life of their forefathers was ever before them urging them on in the path of rectitude and prosperity, while the trumpet tones of Washington never ceased sounding in their ears, "Beware of Foreign Influence." Wearied, after long years, with strategy, during which time the three millions of freemen had swelled to twenty millions, and seeing his blood-coined throne crumbling surely from his grasp, this man of countless crimes, grew weary of delay, and hoped by one master stroke to over-awe the freemen, and before they should ecover from the consternation, to rivet around them his chains. It is here our story must begin. The cursory view we have taken was necessary to show why and how our ancestors became freemen, and the wiles that have been employed to enslave them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>The Arch-Bishop alone in his Library-He reads a Letter-A messenger announced-The Arch-Bishop invites him to his room-He brings instructions from the Pope-The Arch-Bishop remains alone and reads-Its Contents-Resolution to carry the instructions into effect-He writes a Circular, has it printed, and sent to all the Papist Priests, &amp;c., in the United States-His revery broken by the entrance of a little girl-A short conversation, &amp;c.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>DURING an evening of October, 1843, a high Dignitary of the Romish Church, in one of our large cities, sat alone in his Library. His writing-desk stood open before him, while numerous paper packages neatly tied, and bearing the appearance of having been carelessly tossed from their shelves, littered the carpet around. In his hand was an open letter bearing the signet of his Master at Rome, but his eye wandered restlessly from it, as if its contents puzzled and defied him to arrive at the exact meaning of many of its passages, which were possessed of absorbing interest. One sentence his eye sought oftener than the others, but there could be no mistake in the meaning of this. Distrust marked every character. It ran-"It is not prudent to say more until you have answered the questions herein propounded, as I am sorry to say, some of our flock in that<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5770-00000010"/> lawless land, have become imbued with heresies in regard to the temporal dominion of the Church, although they still profess to be very good Catholics." (See Note 1.)</p> 
               <p>"Months ago I assured his Holiness that I was no renegade; (See Note 2,) yet I await in intolerable suspense a reply," said the Arch-Bishop, musingly. "It cannot be," he continued after the lapse of a few minutes, "that he still distrusts me-the proof I gave was ample-and, had I the power, ten thousand heretics should be crushed as I crush this paper, as additional proof of my undying attachment to, and interest in, the prosperity of the Mother Church!" and the Prelate compressed the paper he held in his hands until it assumed a shapeless mass which, in his intensity of thought, he ceased to remember was a sacred missive fresh from his Master's hand.</p> 
               <p>Hour after hour passed away, and the twilight had deepened into night. The hum of the city was fast sinking into the silence of repose. Still he was alone in his library. But now his desk was closed, and he was slowly pacing the room, with stern care and anxiety legibly portrayed on every feature. This was no new mood, and, of late, it had become almost habitual to him. What his thoughts were that night, none but his God ever knew, for they were broken, before they had assumed a definite character, by the presence of a servant bearing a letter on a silver salver. Listlessly the Prelate raised the missive, when its seal met his eye, and, with a cry of pleasure<pb n=""/> sure, in a moment it was broken, and its contents perused. It was a simple letter of introduction, but it was from his Master, and stated that the bearer brought letters of great importance to him, and to Catholicism in America.</p> 
               <p>"Bring hither the stranger, Riley," he said, while the traces of care and anxiety gave away to the all-absorbing one of anticipation and joy.</p> 
               <p>"I crave your pardon, my Lord," said the stranger, as he entered. "I should not have disturbed you at this hour, but my instructions were to seek you the day I landed, and I have scarcely been an hour ashore."</p> 
               <p>"All hours are alike to me for those who bear tidings from his Holiness at Rome, and thrice welcome are you, for you have long been expected. You will make my house your home while in this city," he continued, as he received from the bearer the voluminous despatches, and politely, but precipitately, bowed him from his presence; then, turning the key in the door, he seated himself, and, tearing off the envelope of brown paper, discovered that the contents were sealed with the signet of his Master. A smile of intense satisfaction flashed across his features for a moment, as he surveyed it, then died away, as he eagerly broke the seal, and read the lines inscribed therein. Page after page was read and laid aside, and still he moved not, spoke not, until the last sheet was half read when he came to this clause: "Accomplish this for me, and a Cardinal's hat shall be your reward. I am feeble<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5770-00000011"/> in health, and many years cannot intervene before I must have a successor, who can never be safe here in St. Peter's Chair, while the dissensions are rife even in this our strongest hold of Catholicism. I have long been convinced that the centre of the Church ought to be removed to America, (See Note 3,) and as you, if once a Cardinal, and with the Church indebted to you for the services herein named, will be the most available of the Cardinals to be my successor, your reward will be in accordance with the good you will accomplish for Catholicism." (See Note 4.)</p> 
               <p>"At last," cried the Arch-Bishop, pacing the floor hurriedly, "my life-long wish is within my grasp (See Note 5,)-a Cardinal's hat-I will earn the coveted prize, though I shed every drop of Protestant blood in this heretical land, aye, and Catholic too, if needs be. Once a Cardinal, and the Tiara is not far distant to him that wills it. A Pope never lives long after his successor is prepared to fill his place, and the Holy Father is already obnoxious to one party, while the other fears, and no one loves him." Once more seating himself, he took up the missives, and selecting the second sheet, read in slow measured tones, as if communing with himself-"One of the greatest evils that retards the spread of Catholicism in America, is that offspring of Satan, misnamed Public Schools, where the seeds of heresy (See Note 6,) are sown into tender minds, and growing with their growth, become so engrafted into<pb n=""/> their hearts that they become a part of their being. Our greatest hope is with the rising generation, and we must begin now in order to mould it to our will. You must refuse to send children of Catholic parents to the free schools, alleging as a reason, that the Bible, (See Note 7,) an immoral book, is allowed in them, and demand a separate appropriation to support schools for Catholic children. In pursuing this policy, you will cause dissensions which will lead to divisions, of which you will be wary and take advantage. Another thing which as loudly demands reform is, that of out door declamations and harrangues. Many of our Catholics here learn heresies which they otherwise would not, and hundreds of people who would never enter a building for the purpose, here listen to the abominations almost daily poured forth in the open air. (See Note 8.) This must be made a penal offence, and at all hazards be put down. The press throughout the States calls loudly for reform, and the laws in regard to it must be looked to. It is my firm conviction that it is more detrimental to our cause than any other thing in the Union, and until it shall be taught the reverence and obedience due the Catholic Church, we can never hope to obtain the supremacy in America. You must use your own discretion as to what is the safest and surest modes of accomplishing these reforms. I have written to the other Bishops, but not as freely as I have to you; yet enough to ensure their co-operation harmoniously throughout the Union.</p> 
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5770-00000012"/> 
               <p>Thrice did the Prelate read this precious letter from his Master, then laying it aside, took up the last sheet, and re-read what was to be his reward.</p> 
               <p>"I know," he murmured, "I feel it will be so; something tells me this will; my unconquerable yearning for supremacy over men, will be gratified. (See Note 10.) I have no feeling in common with the herd around me-I feel that I am not of them-that I was born to be obeyed by them. Treated with deference here, and entrusted with discretionary power from his Holiness, I must succeed; aye, and if many years intervene before my purpose is accomplished, I shall not deserve to rule.</p> 
               <p>"I will institute a secret order that shall be more stealthy and silent than that of Loyola. Into its ranks I will press those of our faith of every class, sex, and clime. These shall, while in the performance of the most servile offices, be so many spies in the domestic circles throughout the Union. Weekly they shall report all the information they have gathered to their Confessors, who shall immediately transmit the same to me. Thus I shall obtain a key to what is to be done, in time to thwart their purposes, while the humble position of my agents will shield them from suspicion, and wo be to the one that incurs the displeasure of the St. Leopold." (See Note 11.)</p> 
               <p>The first rays of early dawn came stealing softly through the windows, yet this man had not slept, and thought not of slumber even now; but seating himself at his writing<pb n=""/> desk, prepared a circular for distribution throughout the Union. It ran-"I find to my great sorrow that thousands of the true faith dare rashly to read and interpret for themselves the Bible, when God himself has appointed a living authority to teach the true and legitimate sense of his revelation, to establish it, to settle all controversies on matters of faith and morals with an infallible decision, so that the faithful may not err rashly. (See Note 12.) Therefore, you are hereafter commanded to search every family under your respective charges, and wherein one of these, or other heretical books are found, of whatsoever version, to destroy it without delay. At the same time, parents whose children are attending schools over which heretical teachers are presiding, must withdraw them at once, and await further directions for the provisions of their education."</p> 
               <p>After completing this extraordinary circular, he rang the bell, which was answered by his trusty and faithful Riley. "You will take this paper at once to the Publication Office, and say that at twelve to-day, I must have two thousand copies, ready for the mail," said the Bishop, giving into his servant's hand the circular he had prepared.</p> 
               <p>Receiving the paper with a deferential bow, the servant left the room, and not till then did weariness steal over this man, whose inordinate ambition had destroyed every other principle of honour or integrity. Wearily he sought his<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5770-00000013"/> couch, where his rest was broken by visions of a Cardinal's hat over which hung a glittering Tiara.</p> 
               <p>At eleven the prelate arose, breakfasted, and reached his library at twelve, where, punctual to the hour, arrived printed circulars already folded for the wrappers. Assisted by his secretary, he commenced enveloping and directing these, dispatching them to the post office by hundreds, as they were sealed. While thus engaged, the door opened, and a beautiful child some twelve years of age, bounded in, and throwing her white dimpled arms around his neck, pressed her cherry lips to his forehead, then looked long and earnestly into his eyes.</p> 
               <p>"What is it, Enna?" he inquired, pressing the child still closer in his arms.</p> 
               <p>"Riley said I should not see you to-day-you could not be disturbed-does Enna ever disturb you?"</p> 
               <p>"Never, little one, you are to come to me at all times. Does that please you?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-but-but"-and the child still gazed silently into his face.</p> 
               <p>"But, what? You know you are always to come to me, with your joys and sorrows."</p> 
               <p>"Sister Mary," replied the child sadly, "says I ought to be sent into a convent, and that she shall ask your consent to have me sent immediately."</p> 
               <p>"And you do not care to leave me-is it so?" he asked,<pb n=""/> as he smoothed back from her girlish brow the sunny curls that fell softly over it.</p> 
               <p>"How can you ask if I care to leave you? When you go away and remain for days, and sometimes for weeks, it seems to me as if the days were weeks, and weeks years! I have none to love but you and Sister Geneve," she added sorrowfully</p> 
               <p>"Such has never been my intention, little one, so cheer up," and again and again this stern, ambitious man kissed the child as he held her against his proud stern heart.</p> 
               <p>There never existed a human heart that would not vibrate to some loving hand, and leap in gladness at the approach of the loved one's tread. No position however lofty, or station however low, or even ambition's corroding canker, can destroy this chord which, in many human hearts, is all the link left unsundered between them and their God.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>Virgin-worship in the Oratorio-Relatives to the Arch-Bishop-Conversation between Sister Geneve and Enna-Heretical tendencies manifested-Enna catechized in regard to them-Sister Mary's coldness-Her Jealousy-She annoys Geneve and Enna-Attempt to destroy Enna's Life-Her conduct exposed-Wrath of the Arch-Bishop-He demands an explanation-Harsh words between himself and Mary-He confines her to her room-She attempts to escape but does not succeed.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>IN a small Oratorio of the Arch-Bishop's palace knelt a woman at the shrine of the Virgin Mary. Though in the prime of life, she wore on her brow the marks of a lifetime of care, while her thin transparent fingers, now clasped in prayer, bloodless and cold, and with her fragile, attenuated form, told of an early grave. This was Sister Geneve, an own sister of the Arch-Bishop, and mistress of the palace. There was a piteous, touching tenderness in her cry of "Mary, Mother of God, save <emph>her</emph> from this life of misery, this twofold death that awaits her." Not a tear dimmed her clear hazle eyes, but from their depths shone such rays of mental agony, as only a soul might express when reverting to past years, the remembrance of which only brings grief to the heart and a blush to the cheek, while the brow is hid in the dust, that the light of day may not<pb n=""/> look upon the branded image of God, once pure, once lovely, but now so fallen.</p> 
               <p>The agonized cry was hushed, the still fair head drooped, the eyes half closed, but closer, still closer, the thin fingers were clasped. Visions of her early girlhood came thick and fast before the penitent. She was again the laughter-loving child whose heart knew no sorrow, nor guile. Loved, caressed, home, friends, aye, the very air she breathed, came daily to her, laden with new hopes, new pleasures. Then succeeded her dawning womanhood, and now her pale brow again grew agonized, and prostrating herself, and folding her arms around the foot of the altar, she cried wildly, "Mercy, mercy, immaculate Mother of God, have mercy!" An hour passed, and still that cry ascended, "Mercy, mercy, Mother of God, have mercy!" Still no tear cooled her burning eyes; for alas! years had passed since their fount had been drained-since that first wild cry broke from those lips, "Mercy, mercy, Mother of God, have mercy!" Still another hour passed over Sister Geneve, and, in her agony of soul, she had not seen the door open, nor heard the light step of Enna, who had entered and stood a silent, frightened spectator to her supplication to Heaven, which seemed to the penitent as if it was covered with brass, from whose cold glittering surface her prayers rebounded, and fell back on her defenceless heart, crushing and chilling its feeble pulsations.</p> 
               <p>"No mercy! no Hope!" cried she in agony. "Oh! Mary,<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5770-00000015"/> Mother of God, cannot years of penitence, a life of sorrow, win one token of forgiveness from thee?"</p> 
               <p>"Sister Geneve," said Enna, softly, kneeling by her side, and laying her warm round cheek against the pallid, cold one of the penitent-"say, Father, in Heaven, have mercy, for Christ's sake, who died that we might live!"</p> 
               <p>The flash of surprise that dyed the wan features of Sister Geneve, at the first sound of Enna's voice, as she pronounced her name, died away, as she ceased speaking, leaving them whiter than before, while her own sorrow was swallowed up in the mazes of the astounding revelation this simple sentence conveyed.</p> 
               <p>Rising slowly, and silently, she withdrew the child to a parlour adjoining the oratorio, and seating herself with Enna by her side, gazed long and searchingly in her face, then said, inquiringly-</p> 
               <p>"You are aware, Enna, that I would shield you with my life from every appearance of evil."</p> 
               <p>Enna kissed the hand that clasped hers in answer.</p> 
               <p>"Then tell me, freely and truly, who taught you the heresy you uttered but a few moments since in the oratorio?"</p> 
               <p>"No one, Sister Geneve, I read it on some leaves. Come with me and you shall see them yourself." And the child, followed by her companion, ascended to Enna's room, where she took from a drawer some torn and soiled leaves, and handed them to Sister Geneve, saying, deprecatingly<pb n=""/> catingly, as she pointed to these words, 'Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father, in my name, He will give it you.'</p> 
               <p>When I saw you pray to the Virgin, and heard you say that you had done penance and prayed thus for years, and still she was angry with you, I remembered these leaves, and what the holy Jesus there said, and wished you to ask the mercy denied by the Virgin, of God, for His sake, as it says there. Surely, Sister Geneve, there is no heresy in that," and the child reverently crossed her girlish forehead.</p> 
               <p>"Enna, Enna, you know not what you say! These are leaves from the Heretics' Bible, and that one so young as you could so dissimulate as to retain them without confessing the sin surprises me!"</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Sister Geneve, you wrong me, I never saw the Heretics' Bible, and knew not they were part of it. They came to the store-room as wrappers, where I chanced to see them, and out of curiosity brought them here."</p> 
               <p>As Geneve gazed into the depths of those clear, truthful eyes, she knew in her heart, this was the truth; still, she felt troubled. The soiled, crumpled sheet contained a whole form, closely printed, comprising several chapters of the proscribed Book, and as her troubled glance rested on it, she mechanically read these words aloud: "Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name; ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full."</p> 
               <p>"Dear Sister Geneve, it is Christ who says you have<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5770-00000016"/> asked nothing yet of Him," whispered the child softly. "Forgive me, if I have intruded on this great sorrow that weighs you down; but when Christ is bidding us ask what we will, in His name, of the Father, surely you will not refuse your Enna, when she pleads with you to try the promise of the Holy Saviour."</p> 
               <p>As the child uttered these words she wound her rosy, dimpled arms around the wasting, fragile Geneve, and drew her down by her side as she knelt, murmuring, "Ask of the Father, for Christ's sake.</p> 
               <p>All the sordid passions had long been dead in Sister Geneve's heart, leaving it swayed alone by the one great grief that her heart told her was unforgiven by her God. Could penance wash away guilt, her soul had been radiant in purity; and could the Saints have blotted out that hour of guilt, her prayer must have moved them, had she been thrice fallen.</p> 
               <p>Touchingly beautiful was the sight of that guileless child, kneeling there by the side of Sister Geneve, and radiantly beautiful was the light that hovered around her as from Geneve's colorless lips broke the cry, "Mercy, mercy, Father in Heaven, for Christ's sake have mercy!"</p> 
               <p>Gently removing her arms, Enna arose, and stole softly from the room, leaving Geneve alone with her God.</p> 
               <p>As she passed out, the cold malignant eye of Sister Mary encountered hers: but she was too pure and guileless to understand why Sister Mary had for months exhibited<pb n=""/> hibited a growing dislike for her, which found vent in numberless ways which, unimportant alone, served in the aggregate to tantalize and annoy her daily. If she walked by herself in the garden, or wandered into the summer-house, roamed through their spacious abode, chatted with the servants or their master, or even knelt at the foot of the Altar, it was all the same; that cold, scrutinizing eye was sure to be on her, sure to check the merry, joyous laugh on her lip, her bounding step, and childish song.</p> 
               <p>It was not because Sister Mary was old and austere, or had out-grown all warm emotions of her girlhood, for she was now in the prime of youth and beauty. The rose was still on her fair cheek, dimples clustered around her dewy lips, while her eye was liquid with youth's unquenched fires, and was equally ready as the heart dictated, to dart rays of love or hate.</p> 
               <p>The child shrunk away tremblingly from that glance, but it haunted her the rest of the day, and when in the dead of night she awoke at a slight rustling of the curtains around her bed, it was again before her eyes, and in her terror she shrieked until the halls re-echoed back the sound. In a moment more, the whole household were clustering around her bed, where she lay sobbing and trembling. Closely following the Arch-Bishop came Sister Mary, in time to see him raise the frightened child in his arms and inquire the cause of her distress and terror.</p> 
               <p>Burying her face on his shoulder, she told him all she<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5770-00000017"/> had suffered, for she was too guileless for duplicity, and when she had done, her protector dismissed all those assembled, except Sister Geneve, and then laying the child once more in her bed, conversed with Geneve a few moments in a low tone, during which he seemed troubled and surprised.</p> 
               <p>"You will remain with her the rest of the night, sister, and I will sift this matter in the morning," he said, as he kissed the child gently and left the room.</p> 
               <p>"Enna, are you frightened?" asked Sister Geneve sadly, when they were again alone.</p> 
               <p>"Not now that you are with me, Sister Geneve."</p> 
               <p>"Are you sure you were not dreaming, that, in reality, you saw Sister Mary by your bed?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes-I am sure. I saw her distinctly; her eyes looking so large and strange, and she held a spoon in her hand, and when I awoke it was very near my mouth."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Enna! Enna!" gasped Sister Geneve, in terrified tones, "you have indeed barely escaped a sure but silent death!"</p> 
               <p>"Would she have hurt me, Sister Geneve? How have I offended her that she should wish to injure me?"</p> 
               <p>"She is envious, and envy will lead to wretchedness and crime," returned Geneve evasively, and then soothing her young charge, she was soon sleeping the sleep of innocence. Not so Geneve. A dark suspicion had been awakened in her mind, which dispelled sleep from her eyelids<pb n=""/> lids; she was used to watching and anxiety, and that she now felt for the safety of the beautiful sleeping child, was only a drop in the ocean to her years of unquiet nights, since the spirit of unrest had, in an hour of guilt, riveted its chains around her.</p> 
               <p>The dim flickering light, though casting a few tremulous rays around the bed on which the child lay, only served to make the curtained recesses seem the darker in the heavy shadows that fell upon them. A sofa occupied one of these recesses, on which Geneve had reclined, a position which at once was congenial to the penitent, and commanded a view of the room.</p> 
               <p>The house was hushed into profound repose. Not a footfall could be heard along its halls, or tone in its chambers. Yet Geneve felt not alone. The sweet waters of Divine love rolled over a soul which felt, for the first time in long years, at peace with itself and with its God. The past seemed to that chastened heart like one long troubled dream, from which it had just awoke to know the dream had not been in vain, as it had led her to God. This waking reality was broken by the consciousness that the door was moving slowly on its hinges, and in a moment more a female form entered and approached the bed. Geneve would have shrieked aloud, had not the sound died on her lips in terror, for it was Sister Mary! The child then was right, and related no dream!</p> 
               <p>Stealthily as a snake would approach a bird which it<pb n="36-37 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5770-00000018"/> desired to lure within its fangs, this beautiful, sinful woman approached, and leaning over the bed, held a sponge before the mouth and nostrils of the child. Then contemplating her for a moment, with a gleam of satisfaction playing around her eyes and mouth, she raised a small vial, and filled a spoon, and was in the act of applying it to the child's lips when, Geneve shook off the paralyzing horror that had held her motionless, sprang forward and dashed from her hand the poisonous draught.</p> 
               <p>"You evesdropper! spy! how dare you interfere with me?" cried the guilty wretch, at the same moment she wound her arms, strong in the vigor of youth, around the fragile form of Sister Geneve, and forcing her to the floor, held the sponge she had applied to Enna, forcibly to her mouth and nose, and in a few moments Geneve alike with the child, lay paralyzed and at the mercy of Mary, from whose full round lips issued a low triumphant hissing laugh, as she surveyed her victims. Holding the vial to the light, she said mockingly-</p> 
               <p>"Enough! and more then enough for both! They would spy upon me, prejudice the Arch-Bishop against, and even steal his affections from me!"</p> 
               <p>"Woman! what have you done? Are you mad?" demanded a stern voice, and turning, she stood face to face with the Arch-Bishop, whose quick ears had caught the sound of the struggle between Mary and Geneve, and he<pb n=""/>

                  <pb n=""/> had hastened to Enna's room alarmed for the safety of his sister and the child.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps; nothing is impossible, since my lord does not hesitate to visit, at all hours, the chamber of his sister and child, though she is yet a mere baby!" (See Note 13.)</p> 
               <p>"Woman!-away to your room and when you have obtained your reason, I will see you again!" said the Arch-Bishop in a commanding tone.</p> 
               <p>Sister Mary glad to escape left the room, but still lingered in the darkness of the hall around the door.</p> 
               <p>"Lillian! Lillian! my sister! rouse thee-awake-it is I, your brother, who calls you," said the Arch-Bishop, as he raised Geneve, and laid her tenderly on the couch by the side of the child.</p> 
               <p>"Dead! dead! Oh, Lillian! when our mother gave you in my charge, I dreamed not of this hour! Lillian! Lillian! awake; life is still in thy veins-I feel its labored throes; its efforts to master this lethargy!"</p> 
               <p>Opening the blinds the Arch-Bishop carried his sister to the window, where the fresh air fanned her brow, which brought back the life that hung flickering between the confines of time and eternity.</p> 
               <p>"Mother! mother! your Lillian is here!" murmured the half unconscious girl-then rousing herself she cried-"Where is my mother? Who called me Lillian? Oh brother! brother! is she not here? Am I not then Lillian? but Sister Geneve!"</p> 
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5770-00000020"/> 
               <p>"My poor sister, to me you are still Lillian, as you ever have been, and ever will be-it was I that called Lillian."</p> 
               <p>"Enna-where is she?-did Sister Mary kill her?"</p> 
               <p>"She is unharmed; thanks to the Holy Virgin," he returned, as he bent over her, and felt her regular drawn respiration on his cheek.</p> 
               <p>"My brother! by the memory of our early childhood, and of Enna's sainted mother, who before God was your wedded wife, aye, even as you value this sweet child's purity and life, send back to the Convent this bad woman. You know how I, for your sake, have borne with her in silence, but you still know not all the misdemeanors she has been guilty of. Surely, my brother, you will not sacrifice Isabel's child to her?" (See Note 14.)</p> 
               <p>"Never, Lillian, never: Sister Mary to me is as nothing when weighed in the balance with my Enna. I have only to request that you keep Enna with you for the next twenty-four hours, when this annoyance will have passed away." So saying the Arch-Bishop, left the chamber. Passing along the corridor, he come to the suite of apartments allotted to Sister Mary. These comprised a parlor, sleeping, dressing and bath rooms, with a small closet attached to the dressing room, fitted up as an oratorio. These rooms all communicated with each other, and could be reached from the corridor only by one door, which opened into the parlor. The Arch-Bishop paused before this door, which stood ajar, and, after ascertaining the one he sought<pb n=""/> was not there, entered and crossed over to the door leading to the oratorio.</p> 
               <p>"She has repented her conduct, and is now humbling herself at the altar," he thought to himself, and a smile of satisfaction chased away the angry cloud from his brow. The door of the oratorio was on the latch, and passing within he found no penitent there; but, beyond, moving rapidly in the dressing-room, he saw the figure of a man, through the half open door, and in a moment he stood before him, when beneath the coarse habiliments he recognized her he sought.</p> 
               <p>"Mary! what is the meaning of this?" he demanded sternly.</p> 
               <p>"You have no right to know! These rooms are mine; and I command you to leave them!" returned the woman defiantly, her eyes flashing back the anger she made no attempt to control.</p> 
               <p>"This is an unseemly garb for you, Mary; for what purpose have you assumed it?" he demanded with forced calmness.</p> 
               <p>"It may be to procure a heretic Bible, as your daughter did, of which you will remember I spoke to-day; and it may be, to be married, as you wedded her mother Isabel;" laughed Sister Mary scornfully.</p> 
               <p>"Mary! are you mad?" hissed the Archbishop through his closed teeth, while his lips were livid and his eyes blazed with anger at the knowledge this dangerous<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5770-00000021"/> woman was in possession of-secrets he supposed were known only to himself and sister.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps," mockingly returned Mary, "and in my madness may reveal to the heretics some honorable designs on their institutions; such as suppression of freedom of speech and of the press, raising dissensions among the public schools, which are to be taken advantage of, so as to be led into divisions, of which the reward to his honorable Grace, the Arch-Bishop, is to be a Cardinal's hat-and then you know there is but a single step from that to the Tiara."</p> 
               <p>"That shall never be!-So it seems you have played the evesdropper!" he returned calmly but sternly.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not: will you now leave my room? or shall I tell you of regaling your idle hours with love-letters from Isabel, whose miniature occupies a corner in your cabinet of curiosities? or shall I tell you of visiting your own daughter?"</p> 
               <p>"Wretch! monster!-Enna is as pure as"-</p> 
               <p>"As I when you first became my Confessor. This morning it was my love, my life, my darling!-go on, I am partial to variety, or will you now leave me in quiet possession of my apartments?"</p> 
               <p>"You shall have quiet to your heart's content," and passing out he locked the door that communicated with the corridor, leaving Sister Mary a prisoner in her own apartments.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Knowledge is power, and by mine I have cowed and driven him away; and before he is aware I will be beyond his reach. So saying, Sister Mary gathered a few necessary articles together, rolled them in a bundle, and drawing aside the curtain to satisfy herself if it was yet light enough for flight, and to have the porter astir, with a light step passed through her apartments, to the door that led into the corridor which, to her dismay, she found locked on the outside. (See Note 11.)</p> 
               <p>"He dare not confine me; I will expose him if he attempts it. I am still free to go back to the world if I wish it," and she rattled the door in the vain endeavor to undo its fastening. Finding it resisted her utmost exertions, she sat down and attempted to devise some plan of escape. None offered itself, and thinking her confinement would last but a few hours, she retreated to her dressing-room where, throwing off her masculine garments, as they would, now, rather retard than fecilitate her escape, she once more clothed herself in her own apparel.</p> 
               <p>Hour after hour passed away, and still no one came to release her, or bring her refreshments; and, finally, exhausted with the night's watching and hunger, she fell into a profound slumber. When she awoke, the sun was fast receding in the west, and still she was a prisoner without a morsel to appease her appetite. Alarmed for her own safety, she caught several slips of paper on which she wrote-</p>

               <p>Raising the window, she gave them to the winds, watched their gyrations in the air, and finally saw them descend among the passing crowd below. A gleam of exultation shot through her heart, as she thought of the dismay this act would cause the Arch-Bishop when she saw a man gathering them up.</p> 
               <p>But in a moment it was dispelled, for in him she recognized Riley, the devoted servant of the Arch-Bishop. In her baffled rage she shrieked for help to the passers below her, but her voice passed above them, and they hurried unheedingly along.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely ten minutes elapsed before she heard the key turn in the lock, and the Arch-Bishop stood before her, bearing in his hands the slips she had thrown from the windows, all save one, which, with exultation she saw at a glance was missing.</p> 
               <p>"Mary, has it come to this? that you would sacrifice the good of the Church to your anger?" he demanded reproachfully.</p> 
               <p>"Cecelia Moreton, sir, I am henceforth Cecelia Moreton I know your hypocrisy, and despise you as you deserve. You would starve me here for the good of the Church,<pb n=""/> and why should I not expose you for the same cause?" (See Note 16.)</p> 
               <p>"I come not to bandy words with you, but to preclude a repetition of this unpardonable offence. Come!" and he grasped her arms and dragged her to the bath-room, which had no window, and was lighted only by a sash let into the door. Into this he rudely thrust her, despite her screams and struggles, and fastening the door left her. Night came swiftly on, when two men, masked, entered the bath-room, tied and gagged her, and then carried her down to a carriage in waiting, into which she was lifted, her captors taking their places beside her, when the door was closed and the carriage drove rapidly away.

               </argument> 
               <p>MONTHS passed away and winter succeeded the autumn. It was but a little time, but during those short months what a change in feeling had been wrought between man and his fellow-man-between the sons of the Pilgrims and the representatives of the same power that drove them from their native shores to this then wild, almost unknown land. The poisonous seeds, received by the Arch-Bishop from his master at Rome, and which he had sown in his two thousand circulars had taken root, and emerged into a forest of iniquity which overshadowed the Union.</p> 
               <p>With exultation the Prelate saw the fruits of his schemes, for, in it he recognized one step more towards the coveted prize to which it all tended. This state of affairs was of short duration. The jealousy of the people was at last aroused; they remembered the thraldom under<pb n=""/> which their ancestors groaned in the old world, and arose to avert the impending blow. The same cry from north to south and from east to west, echoed simultaneously: "The mask has fallen-the garb of peace is thrown aside, and the <emph>wolf</emph> in all his native ferocity stands revealed. He has robbed us of our Bibles-he has forced our children from the halls of science, and turned them undisciplined into the highways. He has made us suffer cold and hunger, that he might appropriate the pittance-our all! He has polluted our hearthstones with crimes at which humanity revolts. He bids defiance to the laws of the Union, and adheres to the mandates of a foreign Potentate, and when galled by these indignities, we cry out for succor, he subjects us to malicious libel prosecutions." Nor was this all.</p> 
               <p>In the district of Kensington, Philadelphia, in August, 1843, sat Irene Freeman, alone with her uncle and aunt Connelly. There was a chilling silence resting upon them which neither seemed disposed to break. Mr. Connelly was uneasily pacing the room, casting an occasional furtive glance towards Irene, who was gazing abstractedly at the moving panorama in the street before her, while her aunt sat rocking nervously to and fro, her eye resting with a mother's tenderness upon the troubled brow of the young girl.</p> 
               <p>"Irene," said her uncle, gently, as he paused before her, "Irene, I know not what else to do! I need not tell you<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5770-00000024"/> of the worth of Paul Gordon; you know that already; but, you know not all that I have anticipated from the union of my wards who, if they had been my own children, I could not have loved more."</p> 
               <p>"I am too young to marry; and were I not, I love you and aunt too well to leave you," returned Irene.</p> 
               <p>"But, Paul, think of him."</p> 
               <p>"I ever do, as a brother, and I know him too well to think for a moment, that he would accept an unwilling hand."</p> 
               <p>"Then, Irene, what answer shall I give to the Confessor?"</p> 
               <p>"That my education is sufficient for the sphere I intend to fill, and that I prefer remaining with those who have exercised a father's and mother's care over me."</p> 
               <p>"I have already said this to him; but he insists it was your mother's dying wish, that you should be an inmate of the Convent of St. Michael's, in whose bosom she died, until you should marry. Wed Paul, and that will obviate the necessity."</p> 
               <p>"Uncle? uncle!" gasped Irene, as she started convulsively, then sank back pale and still in her seat.</p> 
               <p>"It is ever thus when we speak of my poor sister and her Confessor! why is it?" said her aunt.</p> 
               <p>"No! no! not there!" cried Irene imploringly; "surely uncle, you, as my relative, can save me!"</p> 
               <p>"I will do anything that is right and just, Irene. The<pb n=""/> Confessor is liberal in his propositions, and St. Michael's Seminary is called one of the best in the city: a far more fitting place for a young, beautiful maiden than a mechanic's rude home."</p> 
               <p>"Not rude to me where you and aunt are. If you have tired of me, I will seek a home elsewhere, but assuredly it shall not be in St. Michael's Convent."</p> 
               <p>"The Curate of St. Augustine's has also offered you an asylum, free of charge," pursued Mr. Connelly, unheeding the remark of Irene</p> 
               <p>"Is there no refuge then, for the orphan? Uncle, hear me, once for all: I will never enter a Convent;" and she turned to leave the room, but at the door encountered the Confessor. There was an exulting fire in his eye as it met hers, which sent the indignant blood to her brow; for had an adder at that moment crossed her path, she could not have turned with more loathing than she did from him, for she felt sure, from his manner, that he had listened to her. The Confessor, with a subdued step, entered the room, and looked inquiringly from Mr. Connelly to his wife.</p> 
               <p>"I have been pressing upon my niece the advantages she would have in a Convent over my home," remarked Mr. Connelly, as he extended to him a hearty welcome.</p> 
               <p>"Then I shall hope to find her more favorable to my propositions," returned the Confessor complacently.</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry to say, they have no effect upon her," he<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5770-00000025"/> replied, but there was no sorrow in his tone, and if his eye might be trusted, he was glad at heart at his niece's decision.</p> 
               <p>"I fear this fair lamb of our flock has not been properly disciplined, to thus set at naught the advice of her elders," said the Confessor in a soft, winning tone.</p> 
               <p>"There is no fault in Irene to discipline," broke in Mrs. Connelly; "she is obedient, loving, and gentle."</p> 
               <p>"Nay, there you are at fault. It is but a few days since, I bade her not fail to come to confession, but the sun went down on her with her sins unforgiven. It is now weeks since she has thus contemned the holy institutions of the Church."</p> 
               <p>"Nay, Father, during those weeks she has confessed at St. Augustine's."</p> 
               <p>The eye of the Confessor for a moment was suffused with anger, but he mastered the emotion as he said-</p> 
               <p>"This is all wrong, my son; I must look after this stray lamb of my flock. How is it between her and Paul?"</p> 
               <p>"She still refuses to marry him, Father."</p> 
               <p>"That is well: I like not this Paul Gordon: he has little reverence for our Church. Are you sure there is no other lover in the case, whom she prefers?"</p> 
               <p>"None-yes, there is young SHIFFLER-but he is a mere boy, and I do not know that she reciprocates the preference he does not attempt to disguise."</p> 
               <p>"Why did I not know of this before?" demanded the<pb n=""/> Confessor angrily. "He is a heretic, and the son of a heretic. Is the Church then, so weak as to suffer the fairest of her flock to be devoured by heretics?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Connelly had arisen at this outburst of passion, and now stood silently, scornfully surveying the Confessor, while a contemptuous smile curled his lip. At last he said-</p> 
               <p>"There is a strong barrier which becomes not even the servant of the Most High to overstep-that barrier lies between temporal and spiritual things."</p> 
               <p>"What! you, too, a heretic!" returned the Confessor, subdued into his usual tone by the merited reproof.</p> 
               <p>"I! never, Father-but you know my father was born here, and I also, and in long generations we have imbibed many of the prejudices of the Americans."</p> 
               <p>"Many evils have crept unwittingly among us-but I forgive you, my son, for I know the Church in you has a firm supporter," he returned gently. But schooled as he had been to repress every outward emotion, Mr. Connelly saw his words came not from his heart, and was not sorry to see him soon after take his leave.</p> 
               <p>On quitting the room, Irene encountered Paul Gordon, who took her hand and led her into another room, as he said sorrowfully-</p> 
               <p>"I heard it all, Irene-and you were right; I would never accept an unwilling hand. Forget that I ever aspired<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5770-00000026"/> pired to be more than a brother, and with a sister's love I will strive to be content."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! my brother-ever noble-ever generous," murmured the young girl.</p> 
               <p>"And you were right, also, in refusing the shelter of the Convent. We may be rougher on the surface than they, but there are no hearts truer than ours, or arms stronger to shield from danger. One other there is, whose heart will leap with joy at your decision, and though he is young in years, yet he is old in energy and thought. Adversity is a sad teacher, and when she struck down the father of young SHIFFLER, and left his mother alone in the world, with George as her only aid, she gave him his first bitter lesson. Many has he had since then; and now, my sister, it is but fair that he should have, in the future to cheer him on, a rich reward."</p> 
               <p>"You are silent, Irene," pursued Paul, after a moment's pause. "Yet my heart tells me it is for my friend you reserve this hand; he will one day be worthy of it. Have you learned to distrust your brother?"</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Paul; but you distress me. The future looks dark before me. Shiffler thinks only of his widowed mother's trials, and looks only to the day when he can free her from the care of his young brothers and sister. I know not if his thoughts for a moment ever rested on me."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Irene, he knew I loved you, and for his life would<pb n=""/> not have stepped between us; but you have yourself decided, for I would never take this hand unaccompanied by the heart; and now, if he can win it, Paul Gordon is not less honorable than he has been."</p> 
               <p>A bright glow suffused the brow of Irene, and in it Paul read the hopes that were dawning in that young heart, and though it sent a pang through his own, yet he loved her with a passion too pure and holy to allow the sickening void in his own breast to cast a shadow on the budding hopes that lighted up that brow with the divine rays of holy human love. Had he cherished her less truly he had been less generous; but he felt too keen a smart in his own breast to see it inflicted on that lost, to him, but no less loved one.</p> 
               <p>Thus sat the two, when a shadow fell across the threshold-it was the Confessor, who had left Mr. Connelly to seek her. The two arose to greet him-Paul politely-Irene proudly.</p> 
               <p>"The blessings of the Holy Church rest upon you, my children," he murmured in low, thrilling tones, and with a grace no one knew better how to assume.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Father," replied Paul, "but methinks they are of little service, unless a higher power adds a blessing also."</p> 
               <p>"True, my son, true; but what the Church blesses the Arch-Bishops bless, and what they bless the Pope blesses,<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5770-00000027"/> and what he blesses, God, the Father, blesses through the intercession of the Saints."</p> 
               <p>"Which is all very well, if it cannot be obtained more directly," returned Paul, in a respectful tone.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Holy Mary! Mother! with what heresies has not the Infallible Church become imbued!" replied the Confessor, as he crossed his forehead and counted his breviary. Then turning to Paul he added in a commanding tone, "Paul Gordon, the Devil has obtained possession of thy soul, that he may sift thee as wheat-come to the confessional, that penance may drive him hence. And thou, Irene Freeman, daughter of a Saint in Heaven, and a lost soul, come thou also, lest thou be swallowed up in iniquity, and the ban of the Church be publicly pronounced against thee!" (See Note 18.)</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, no, Father, not that! I will come and confess, but do not curse me with the Church's awful curse!" cried Irene, in terror; for, far away in the distant past, loomed up a terrible vision, of a maiden cowering before the dreadful words that fell from a Priest's lips, as he, before hundreds of scrutinizing eyes, pronounced the awful curse of the Church upon her, and she felt in her breast that she would rather have died than endure it.</p> 
               <p>"Father! Father! you have no right thus to insult her," cried Paul indignantly. "She, to my knowledge, has weekly been to confession at St. Augustine's."</p> 
               <p>"Obstinate diseases require harsh remedies, my son,<pb n=""/> and the Church will not lose her own when these remedies can give them back to her arms." So saying the Confessor left them. Irene's mind, was torn by conflicting emotions, and Paul's swayed by the indignation he did not attempt to suppress. (See Note 19.)</p> 
               <p>"Irene, my sister, go not to that man to confession. I like not his looks, nor yet his words. Ah! were Father Moriarty at home, I should have no fear of further annoyance. The Curate, however, who officiates in his stead at St. Augustine's, is more suitable for you to confess to, and I think it better that you communicate with him, and then, if this man still annoys you. I shall not hesitate to inform the Bishop."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, Paul, do not make so small an affair so public, I will attend confession at St. Michael's until Father Moriarty returns from Europe, when I will attend St. Augustine's again."</p> 
               <p>Paul looked troubled, but did not press the matter further, and soon went out, leaving Irene alone. The day wore away and twilight with her silvery hue lay like a soft curtain over the city. The sharp click of the mechanic's implements of labor were hushed-the drayman's car no longer rumbled over the pavements; but in their stead thousands of artizans wandered forth in the cool evening air. All through the long summer day, regardless of the fierce August heat, they had toiled on, cheered by the thought that thus they were gathering new comforts with<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5770-00000028"/> which to surround the loved ones at home. The evening was theirs, and with a consciousness of duty performed whereby they had earned their hour's relaxation, they, in the evening hour, comprised the most joyous and light-hearted portion of the city.</p> 
               <p>Irene, at this hour sat alone by the window, where we first saw her-but not long, for a quick eager step crossed the threshold, and young Shiffler stood before her.</p> 
               <p>"Irene! Irene! is this true? I must hear you say it, although I know Paul would not so excite hope in my breast to see it crushed!" said he gently, as he clasped her hand in his own.</p> 
               <p>A bright, glad smile played around her mouth, as her eye rested proudly upon her boy-lover, but she did not withdraw her hand and he continued-</p> 
               <p>"I have nothing to offer you but a true heart, a strong arm, and an honorable name. Can you relinquish all the high hopes of a station your wealth of beauty and mind entitle you to, for an humble life with a mechanic who, for years yet to come, cannot even offer you a home, though ever so lowly?"</p> 
               <p>"We are young yet," whispered Irene softly, "and in the years that must elapse ere we reach an age fitting for higher responsibilities much may be done. We make ourselves what we are-and with courage and perseverance there is no position to which we may not attain."</p> 
               <p>"Irene! my Irene! your words have opened for me a<pb n=""/> higher, broader sphere than ever before dawned upon my wildest dreams. If my Maker gives me life and health I will, ere many years, deserve so great a prize as this hand. Once my own master, and the goal is not far distant. Thanks to our forefathers who won this boon for us, that no man is born to station or honor-they are alone for those who deserve them."</p> 
               <p>"With a strength of purpose like this, you may overcome all difficulties, and when that hour shall come, it shall not long be withheld."</p> 
               <p>"With the hopes you have given me to beckon me on, my arm will never tire, my spirit never faint. Oh, blessed future! how laden thou art with felicity to reward a boyhood of toil and care, and a dawning manhood of energies that defies obstacles to daunt or turn from its purpose."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>Mr. Connelly thinks the Confessor had been misunderstood-Joy at the reliquishment of the Confessor's claims on Irene-Partial confidence in him restored-Irene goes to the Confessional and Paul fears the result-Her mysterious disappearance-Intense alarm-The Confessor accused of abducting her-His stolid indifference-His premises searched-Portions of her dress found-Dreadful Excitement-Popular feeling on the subject.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>"I think," remarked Mr. Connelly, a few days after the above events had transpired, "that we have misunderstood the Confessor-he has withdrawn all claims to the guardianship of Irene, and protests that his only object in asserting them was to prepare her in the seminary for a higher sphere in life than she could fill with her present acquirements. He denies ever desiring she should become a nun."</p> 
               <p>"Yet, that has been his ostensible object for the last three months," returned Mrs. Connelly. "There is something about him I do not like. He professes to attempt a scheme, and when he fails, boldly denies attempting it-this is not consistent."</p> 
               <p>"I fear, Ann, you are prejudiced. It is very wrong in us to harbor ungrounded prejudices against any person,<pb n=""/> and when they are harbored against a servant of the Holy Church they are doubly criminal."</p> 
               <p>"I can not avoid it. No one revered him more than I, until my poor sister sickened and died, and since that hour I have ever felt a loathing for him. I know it is wrong, sinful; yet I cannot keep it out of my heart-it rises up with the cold, pale face of Ellen. Irene also feels thus, and I am rejoiced to hear he has relinquished his claims on her, which I truly believe were extorted from her mother, as she shared with Mr. Freeman, prejudices against our institutions."</p> 
               <p>"I hope time will dissipate these feelings which are sinful to indulge in, Ann. The Confessor was right and manly in withdrawing claims which could have been only pursued by coercion, as Irene would never voluntarily enter the Convent. The Church certainly over-steps her bounds when she attempts force to carry out her plans, although she knows those plans were for the good of those upon which they were employed."</p> 
               <p>"My sentiment also-but where is Irene? I have been hunting the house over for her," cried Paul, as he entered the room.</p> 
               <p>"She went out an hour ago, but will soon return, as she has only gone to our Church to confession," returned Mrs. Connelly.</p> 
               <p>For a moment an angry flash shot across Paul's brow, as he cried, "Why will she presist in going there!" then with<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5770-00000030"/> white, compressed lips, he seized his hat, and with rapid strides, wended his way to the Church. Passing within, he saw the door of the Confessional was open, and no one within.</p> 
               <p>"She has already gone home," said he to himself, and turned to leave the Church, when the ivory head of a parasol broken near the silk, met his eye, as it lay on the floor close by the door that led to the Sacristy, and on it he recognized the same carved devices which he had often remarked distinguished the one Irene carried. Paul was puzzled for a moment, and his eye wandered thoughtfully over the floor when he detected a rose-colored glove laying between the sill and the closed door. With care he drew it out, and then remembered he had seen Irene wear a pair of similar color, when they walked to Church together the Sabbath before, and at once a fearful foreboding almost paralyzed him.</p> 
               <p>"Are not these Irene's?" demanded Paul, rushing into the room where Mrs. Connelly sat, as he flung the ivory and glove to her.</p> 
               <p>"Irene's! ah! yes," said she thoughtfully "this glove looks like hers, and this ivory, if not her parasol top, is like hers"-then she continued, "how excited you are, Paul-where did you find these? It is quite time Irene returned! I wonder where she is!"</p> 
               <p>"Heaven only knows!" cried Paul, "if she is out of that Church, she certainly is not in the Confessional, and these<pb n=""/> I gathered from the floor, by the door that leads to the Sacristy!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Paul! what is the meaning of this? Where is Irene?"</p> 
               <p>"What of Irene? Has she not returned yet?" demanded Mr. Connelly as he entered from an adjoining room, and heard Irene's name repeated in excited tones.</p> 
               <p>"Well," said he carelessly, when he had heard all, "I can see very little cause for alarm. She may have stopped on the way home at an acquaintance and will soon be in. The glove might have been dropped, and the parasol, if hers, broken as she came out. Ladies' gloves and parasols are all alike, and these may not be even hers."</p> 
               <p>Paul was not, however, satisfied. He did not like the Father Confessor, and was unwilling to have Irene go there, and turn as he would, the glance of triumph which lighted up the Confessor's features when Irene gave her promise to confess to him, haunted him. Still he determined to wait a while to see if she would by her return dispel this insupportable anxiety.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Connelly shared this state of feeling with Paul, and nervously watched for the light familiar step of the young girl.</p> 
               <p>One, two-the clock told the third hour, and still she came not. Mr. Connelly and Paul wended their way to the Confessional, and demanded to see the Confessor. They<pb n="62-63 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5770-00000031"/> found him at his house, and smiling gently in his winning way, he arose to receive them.</p> 
               <p>"Has my neice, Irene Freeman, been here to confession to-day?" demanded Mr. Connelly peremptorily as he, with an impatient motion of his hand, declined the proffered hospitalities.</p> 
               <p>"The maiden unburthened her heart before the Church which sent her away rejoicing without a sin unforgiven," returned the Confessor complacently, as he pressed the cross he wore to his lips, and bent his head in devotion. But there was a shade of anxiety on his brow, and when Irene's name was mentioned, the same gleam of triumph that Paul had seen once before, flashed from his eye.</p> 
               <p>"Then why did she not come home?-and, why were these found by the Sacristy door?-tell me that, or by the Saints above, Confessor though you be, you have not ten minutes life in you!" cried Paul angrily, as he grasped the Confessor roughly by the arm, and held before him the glove and piece of ivory.</p> 
               <p>For a moment the Confessor was livid and trembled with fear and rage, as his eye fell on those tell-tales, then by a masterly effort he subdued the rising tempest in his breast, and said calmly-</p> 
               <p>"My son, I pardon this unseemly rudeness to a servant of the Holy Church. Surely, it is wrong to blame me, if the maiden has fallen into snares. I sent her away without sin. She has, it seems, as is her wont, abused the clemency<pb n=""/>

                  <pb n=""/> ency of the Church, returned the Priest in his insinuating silvery tones.</p> 
               <p>"It is false! She is still in this Church or the buildings attached, and unless you lead the way into every nook and corner about it, that we may satisfy ourselves, within the hour, I will have the police perform the office for me," cried Paul, enraged at what he was sure was the duplicity of the Confessor.</p> 
               <p>The Confessor quailed at this threat, and for a moment stood irresolute, while with all his efforts he could not control the tell-tale lines of suppressed rage that corrugated his features.</p> 
               <p>"Why do you hesitate?" demanded Mr. Connelly. "A Church ought not to cover anything it fears to have the world see; come, lead on; I want this affair cleared up!"</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my son, it is not that which troubles me, but the sin, the sacrilege"-</p> 
               <p>"Sin, sacrilege," cried Paul impatiently-"where is Irene-it is she I want! her I will have, though I move Heaven and earth to find her!"</p> 
               <p>"I know not, my son, where the maiden has strayed, unless she is keeping tryst with some gay deceiver."</p> 
               <p>"Confessor-or imp! or whatever you are! how dare you say this to me," cried Paul indignantly-"move on-we are losing time;"-and finding them resolved, he unlocked the Sacristy door, and proceeded to lead them over the<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5770-00000033"/> Church. Every nook and corner was searched, but no other clue was discovered to the missing girl.</p> 
               <p>"There is a vault below! Down to the vault!" cried Mr. Connelly, indignantly. The Confessor obeyed this order with alacrity. The vault had a number of cells in it, walled and entered only by a narrow plank door heavily ribbed with iron, and though they looked within every one, nothing was found to even excite suspicion.</p> 
               <p>While examining these vaults, Mr. Connelly and Paul followed the Confessor into one, when the priest sprang out, shut the door instantly; but in a moment, before he could draw the bolt, the weight of the two men were thrown against it, and it flew open and they confronted the treacherous Confessor.</p> 
               <p>"You have played a fine farce in forcing me over the Church, and I have frightened you in return. Now we are even," said the Confessor in a voice which sounded harsh, though he evidently attempted to modulate it to the usual tone.</p> 
               <p>The two men looked at him searchingly for a moment, and they saw he quailed beneath their glance. Then Mr. Connelly said sternly.</p> 
               <p>"That you know more of this affair then you choose to tell, I am now convinced. If Irene is home in an hour, this affair shall sleep forever between us-if not, I shall invoke the aid of the civil power."</p> 
               <p>"You dare not on your life: you dare not expose a<pb n=""/> Church affair to the heretics," cried the Confessor, thrown from his guard by the disgrace and scandal that menaced him.</p> 
               <p>"We both dare and will, unless you return her within the hour," and they turned to ascend the stairway, when a narrow white strip of muslin hanging on a corner of a stair attracted Paul's attention. He picked it up and found it about two inches wide, half a yard long, and was of white dotted mull.</p> 
               <p>"You see this, do you?" said Paul sternly. "Well, I know not whether Irene wore a dress like this or not, but mother will know, and if it is as I suspect, one more clue to my poor lost Irene has been found."</p> 
               <p>The Confessor looked alarmed but recovered himself quickly, and answered,</p> 
               <p>"If you dare brave the anger of the Church, I have nothing to fear in the course you intend to pursue, though for your own sakes, you had better reflect on the consequences before you commit yourselves further."</p> 
               <p>"Come, it is useless to waste time here," said Mr. Connelly. "We must see if, indeed, this be part of Irene's dress."</p> 
               <p>At home, they found Mrs. Connelly in great distress at their prolonged absence, which was augmented at the sight of the strip of dotted lawn.</p> 
               <p>"It has been rent from the skirt of her dress! Oh Irene! my poor Irene," cried she in the agony of her heart.</p> 
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5770-00000034"/> 
               <p>Paul could bear no more, but left the house, and hastened before a magistrate to whom he made his complaint, charging the Confessor with forcibly detaining the young girl. A search warrant was issued, and three officers were detailed to see that it was carried into effect. The three were Irish Catholics, and proceeded to their duty with loud protestations against an act they looked upon as one of sacrilegious impiety. They went where the Confessor led them in the Church, parsonage and Convent-but they made no efforts to pentrate any door into which the Confessor did not voluntarily invite them to enter. Nothing was elicited by the search, and the officers were loud in their full belief of the Confessor's innocence, piety and humility.</p>

               <p>All that long night of agony, Paul and Mr. Connelly, hoping against hope that they might find the lost one,<pb n=""/> wandered over the city. Thrice had they paused before the lodgings of Shiffler, to bear to him tidings of the terrible blow which hung over them, which they had no power to avert, and, unequal to the task, had turned away.</p> 
               <p>"No, not yet, the blow will be heavy enough when it comes," Paul would say, and they again pursued the unavailing search for the lost Irene.</p> 
               <p>When Mrs. Connelly was alone she, more than ever realized the calamity, and, half distracted, she, too, sought the Confessor, who received her with lowering brow, which bore traces of baffled rage.</p> 
               <p>"Give me back Irene!" she cried. "See, I kneel to you, and in the name of her mother, demand this act of restitution, of justice!"</p> 
               <p>"Woman, how dare you charge me with a knowledge of her? I have been outraged sufficiently already by the rest of your family, and will submit to no more-leave me!"</p> 
               <p>"Spurn me not thus, Father, I only claim my own-my Ellen's child, whom I promised her dying mother to protect with my life! Restore her to me and I will bless you, and her sainted mother will bless you."</p> 
               <p>"Do you then dare dictate to the Church. There is too much of this among you rabble. Away, I say, away!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Father! Father! by the saints and holy relics-by the immaculate Mother of God-aye, by her holy Son, spurn me not thus, I implore you!"</p>

               <p>"Woman," said he, laying his hand on her roughly, "leave me, nor ever dare again question an act of the Church, or by the powers you invoke, you shall feel its authority, and all the heretics in the Union shall not save you. Go!"</p> 
               <p>Slowly Mrs. Connelly arose from her kneeling posture, and proudly confronted the Confessor. The scales had fallen from her eyes, and beneath the garb of the meek and lowly Jesus, the wolf stood revealed.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, man of many crimes," she said slowly and firmly, "the day will come when you shall kneel in vain for mercy, as I have knelt to you; when the blood of your victims shall be a sea of fire about you, and in that hour the blood of Ellen whom you murdered to obtain possession of her child, will also be found on your hands!" and turning away, she left the Confessor livid with rage and terror, that he was unmasked, that a crime he deemed known only to himself, his victim, and his God, was known to another.</p> 
               <p>The night of grief had done its work on Mrs. Connelly-her brown hair had become white as snow! The thought of the barbarous torture that the delicate, beautiful young girl would be subjected to, had done the work of years. All the long night she prayed that Irene might die-and that she was dead was all the support she found at the dawn of day.</p> 
               <p>An hour passed, when the door was flung violently open,<pb n=""/> and Shiffler, pale and haggard, with the morning paper in his hand came in, and springing forward caught Mr. Connelly by the collar, as he cried-</p> 
               <p>"Where is Irene? Give me back my Irene! Think you I will thus give her up? Did I win to lose her?"</p> 
               <p>"Shiffler!" said Paul gently as he laid his hand on his arm, "look at Mrs. Connelly-at us-do you suffer more than we?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh! God! this is more than I can bear!" and, overcame, he would have fallen had not Paul led him to a seat, and then gave him a full account of her disappearance, the efforts used to discover her, and the hope which still remained that the reward offered would stimulate search which would lead to her recovery.</p> 
               <p>The long, weary hours of the day and night wore away, and their hearts grew weary and sick with hope deferred. Aye, weeks and months elapsed, and the beautiful lost young girl was forgotten by the busy throng, or if for a moment remembered, it was with a shudder at her probable fate. The hearts of Mr. and Mrs. Connelly had become calm, but it was the calmness of despair. Nightly, during all these months, even into the small hours, Paul and Shiffler had been untiring in their search, though they had little hopes of finding her, for the conviction had settled on their hearts that she had been abducted by the Confessor. This conviction they took no pains to conceal, but on the contrary impressed it also upon their companions<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5770-00000036"/> panions, by reverting to the traces they found of her in the Church, until a strong anti-Catholic feeling was implanted among them, which daily grew stronger and became more diffused, more general.</p> 
               <p>The day of Irene's disappearance she had proceeded to the Church, and knelt at the Confessional, and as the wily Confessor step by step led her on, she guilelessly spoke of her present happiness and future hopes, when her boy-lover should emerge into manhood. As she continued to unveil her heart thus, she saw not the smile of mockery and triumph that lighted up the Confessor's dark features, for her heart was bowed in humility, and her dreamy eyes were closed, as if to shut out all unholy thoughts from her heart. He again pressed her to enter the Convent, until the time should arrive for the solemnization of her marriage, to which she gently but decidedly refused with a gesture of impatience and disgust. In vain the Confessor pointed out the great advantages she would derive from it-but she was firm in declining. Then he became convulsed with suppressed passion; still the young girl heeded it not, she was communing with her God. The Confessor arose, passed out, and before she missed him a hand was laid over her mouth, and in an instant she was dragged from the Confessional, and though she exerted her utmost strength to free herself, was borne through the Sacristy into the body of the Church; thence to the vestibule and down the stairs to the vault beneath; and thence<pb n=""/> into one of the cells, the door of which the Confessor locked behind him, when he for a moment released her-but she was unconscious. Taking a small lantern from his pocket, he struck a light, and by its aid touched a spring in the rough wall of the cell, when a small door painted and grained so as to resemble granite, opened and he once more turned to raise her in his arms to bear her through the door. She was reviving, and when she saw she was irrecoverably in his power, unless he voluntarily released her, she threw herself at his feet and had not he been a monster her prayers would have moved him.</p> 
               <p>His only answer was-"You are the bride of Heaven now-my bride!-think you we allow a boorish heretic to possess our most charming maidens-mine in life-Heaven's in death!-you ought to envy the future that awaits you," and he clasped his long, serpent-like arms around her, and as the folds tightened she struggled, gasped, shuddered and relapsed into unconsciousness, as he bore her through the door which he closed after him, and through a long, narrow passage, which ended in a small room, the walls of which were of stone, over which tapestry had been hung to exclude the dampness that gathered on the walls. A thick matting covered the floor which, with two chairs, a table, bed and washstand, completed the furniture. Into this room he bore her, the young, the innocent and beautiful Irene Freeman, and there we must leave her. The Confessor is unmasked,<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5770-00000037"/> and it is not our province to dwell on the torture inflicted on her, but to spare those to whom she was dear who still survive, to mourn over the crimes practised in the name of the sin-polluted Church.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>The Confessor's joy at receiving the Arch-Bishop's Circular-His overbearing austerity and assumed humility-He attempts to wrest the Bible from those under his charge who possessed them-His interference in their worldly business-He meets considerable opposition-He pursues his purpose-Persecution of Mr. Steinmitz-He succeeds in getting him discharged-Mr. Steinmitz's sons are also persecuted-The excitement in regard to Catholic interference still increases-He continues to persecute them.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>IRRITATED by the opposition he had received in the abduction of the beautiful orphan, the Confessor received with joy the Circular of the Arch-Bishop. Now he had the power to punish the presumption of several of his flock who, since the disappearance of Irene Freeman, had studiously shunned him, and all the most beautiful of the females had since avoided the Confessional, or came only with attendants. He made every effort to appear calm, composed, and always to appear humble, guileless, but there were those who looked beneath the specious covering, and peremptorily forbid their wives and daughters to trust themselves within the tempter's reach. They knew there was a Judas of old, and they feared one was among them. The Confessor could not shut his eyes to these silent but not<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5770-00000038"/> the less felt accusations, and he began to think he was paying dear for his prize.</p> 
               <p>"Now," he exultingly cried, as he read the Circular, "the Church has at last awoke from her lethargy to her true interest, and I have the means to subdue them. They shall own her unquestionable supremacy, or feel her power. There are places that no eye but our own has ever seen, and there they who resist our power shall rot like so many dogs!" (See Note 18.)</p> 
               <p>In obeying the mandates of the Arch-Bishop's Circular he met with more opposition than he had anticipated. Among a few of the most illiterate his word was their law. They would as soon have questioned a right to their own existence as his right to dictate to them what to do in their temporal affairs. Taught from their birth up to kiss the dust whereon a priest had trod as hallowed ground, they acknowledged no law but what he sanctioned-no right to think or act without his approval, and were fit subjects to obey such a master. (See Note 19.)</p> 
               <p>But there was another class in his flock, and they were by far the largest and most influential part of it, who bowed to him in reverence and humility in the affairs of the Church; but when he attempted to interfere, or influence them about their temporal affairs, turned coldly from him, and in many instances, peremptorily denied his right to dictate to them. These were mostly those who had been born in this country, and many of them had descended from<pb n=""/> revolutionary forefathers, who had won and bequeathed the boon of liberty to them, which they felt they had no right to resign. Others of them had felt the galling yoke of oppression in the old world, and though they had fled from servitude, they still clung tenaciously to the faith of their fatherland; but in fleeing renounced the unholy union of Church and State.</p> 
               <p>Most of this class peremptorily refused to relinquish their Bibles, and others who saw with parental pride, the expanding intellects of their children under the salutary influence of the Public Schools, refused to withdraw them, though taunted by their brethren with supporting heretical institutions.</p> 
               <p>Of this class was Loeb Steinmitz who had seen much hardship which he, with a strong arm and brave heart, had battled with until he had made for himself and his eleven children and their mother a home and hearthstone around which nightly clustered in contentment the little band, whose hearts were with their home, which to them was as dear as the gilded crown to a king. Charles and Ellis Steinmitz, his two eldest, were already in the High School, while the younger ones were distributed from the primary department upwards as they progressed in their studies. Much of the hardship this family had been called to endure had arisen from the determination on his part to impart to his children a boon of which he had been deprived, an English education. To this end he had kept his children<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5770-00000039"/> around him, toiling himself from the rising until the setting of the sun. When he looked with a father's pride on his noble, intellectual children, with the light of expanding genius illumining their brows, he felt repaid for all his toil and deprivations, and thanked Heaven that his children through his exertions would be endowed with a blessing from which he had been deprived.</p> 
               <p>To the home of Steinmitz the Confessor had been ever welcome. They did not always agree in opinions, and the Confessor often shook his head doubtingly, when the boys advanced some of the republican sentiments with which they were strongly imbued, and he had years previously urged their father to put them to day labor, assuring him that, for their station in life, it was far better than so much learning.</p> 
               <p>Steinmitz had said nothing, but pursued his own course up to the present time, and when the stories of the abduction of Irene got abroad, had requested his eldest daughter a young girl of fourteen, not to attend Confession at their Church, unless attended by her mother.</p> 
               <p>The Confessor felt galled at Mr. Steinmitz for this, and in no gentle manner ordered him to withdraw his children from school, and proceeded to search among their collection of books, to satisfy himself if they had a Bible or any heretical books. A bible was found, and walking up to the open grate in which was a fire, without a word, and<pb n=""/> before the rest were aware of his purpose, threw it in. (See Note 20.)</p> 
               <p>"What have you done!" cried Ellis, as he sprang forward and caught the scorched and blackened Book from the flames.</p> 
               <p>"Purging my flock from the heresies that for years have crept into it, my son. Throw it back; it is the Church which cannot err that commands you."</p> 
               <p>"No: by all the Saints! that you shall never do!" broke in Steinmitz angrily, as his son turned appealingly to him-"And sir," said he, addressing the Confessor, "because it is you, I forgive this outrage, but beware how you repeat it!"</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my son," said the Confessor, "I obey the Church, and what she commands, it would be a crime to leave undone. You must burn that Book of heresies. This trouble comes from learning your children to read: had you brought them up as your sainted father brought you up, I should have been spared my thankless task!" (See Note 21.)</p> 
               <p>"My father brought me up as well as his taskmasters would allow him, and when he found they took the bread from his children's mouths for tithes and taxes, he left them and brought us where we could reap the reward of our labor. Heaven be praised that here the children of the poor emigrant may become equals to the highest in the land if they are deserving."</p> 
               <pb n="80-81 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5770-00000040"/> 
               <p>"My son, such notions illy become a man in your situation. You are ruining your children by such nonsense. Teach them instead to love and revere the Church and her servants, to pay their tithes, and always attend the Confession, and leave the rest to the Church. In short, my son, teach them to emulate their sires of old. My orders must not be trifled with-obey them!" (See Note 22.)</p> 
               <p>"Never; I will appeal to Bishop Patrick!"</p> 
               <p>"Do so, and he will tell you he gave me the Circular, with his sanctions of the fulfilment of every requirement."</p> 
               <p>"Then I will appeal from him to the Arch-Bishop. Think not I will now relinquish a life cherished scheme of preparing my children to enter the world upon equal terms with any native-born children."</p> 
               <p>"The orders came from the Arch-Bishop, and it is whispered he has a personal interest in seeing them executed."</p> 
               <p>"Then, by Heaven, I will appeal to the Pope himself. There is justice somewhere, and I will find it!"</p> 
               <p>"It was from His Holiness the Arch-Bishop received the order for them; we are only servants, all of us, to do his bidding."</p> 
               <p>Steinmitz was perplexed-and commenced pacing the floor hurriedly-thoughtfully.</p> 
               <p>"Father, is not the Pope a foreign Potentate?" inquired Charles.</p>

               <p>"Certainly-why do you ask?"</p> 
               <p>"Has he then, any right to command us Americans? and when he does command ought we to obey-he being a foreign power?"</p> 
               <p>"No, by the Saints! my son: we are now Americans, and we will never perjure ourselves to our country, for even the Pope. He may regulate for us the tenets of our faith, but no further. Hurra for America!" cried Steinmitz, exulting at what he thought would silence the Confessor.</p> 
               <p>"I see you are obstinate now, but the Church will bring you to reason soon," retorted the Confessor at this outburst of patriotism, when he, without having gained his point took his leave.</p> 
               <p>"How is this, Steinmitz," said his employer the next morning, when at early dawn he repaired to his daily labor. What is this that I hear of your disobedience? Know you not it is your place to follow implicitly the path your superiors point out to you? From insubordination of the people of your class, arises all the disturbances which have ever agitated the world, and until you learn obedience to those born to guide your thoughts and actions you cannot labor for me another day. Your example would contaminate the rest of the men under my employ." (See Note 23.)</p> 
               <p>Steinmitz was dumb with astonishment. He had not divined that the Confessor could be so base; yet in an instant<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5770-00000042"/> stant he knew it must be so-that he had been to his em ployer and procured his discharge.</p> 
               <p>He would have explained, but was ordered out of the yard, and bade go first and make his peace with the Church.</p> 
               <p>Troubled but indignant he returned to his home, to his wife and children, and related what had occurred. They were so much shocked and surprised at the Confessor's baseness that, their respect for his calling was swallowed up in the enormity to which he had degraded his office, and they commented in no measured terms upon the unchristian act. Nor were they alone in this, for the whole affair soon spread throughout the district, and the feeling of commiseration was strong in the favor of Steinmitz.</p> 
               <p>Day after day elapsed, yet he had not been able to procure steady employment, when, without his knowledge, his two eldest boys left their school, and procured situations as clerks in dry-goods stores. Their father remonstrated, but they were firm in their determination, when he yielded the point and they went on very well for a few days, when the Confessor entered the store where Charles was employed, and while purchasing, kept his eye fixed on the boy so sharply as to attract the attention of the proprietor, who glanced from him to the boy uneasily. That look certainly had a peculiar expression in it, and as the Confessor caught the storekeeper's eye watching him enquiringly, he dropped his eyes demurely for a moment<pb n=""/> when they were again fixed on the boy's face as before. The storekeeper was becoming nervous and, approaching his customer, said carelessly-"Fine boy that-a new hand; but will soon learn."</p> 
               <p>"Ah!" said the Confessor coldly, without dropping his eyes, while a sarcastic smile played around his lips.</p> 
               <p>The storekeeper was still growing more uneasy-the manner more than the simple ejaculation, although that spoke volumes, irritated him. At length he said-</p> 
               <p>"You seem to take an interest in the lad; may I ask if you know him?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly," returned the Confessor blandly, as he prepared to leave the store. "I have known him from a mere infant up to the present time, and have been puzzled to know how <emph>he</emph> should be employed by a respectable establishment like yours." So saying, the Confessor bowed politely to the astonished storekeeper, and in a moment was in the street, chuckling over his fiendish work, while at the same moment Charles was, without a word of explanation, paid for his few days' labor, and coldly discharged. (See Note 24.)</p> 
               <p>Within an hour the same scene was enacted at the store in which Ellis was employed, and with like success; and they returned home furious with passion at the persecution they were called to endure.</p> 
               <p>This last act following so closely upon the other, procured friends for Steinmitz, and he was offered situations<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5770-00000043"/> for himself and boys in a Protestant establishment, which he gladly accepted for himself, but declined for the lads, as he was firm in his determination, now that he could labor again, to carry out his original plan in regard to his children. "I can work for you yet," he would say, "and labor to me is not hard, when I look away into the future and see my own children reaping the reward of my industry. I think of this through the day, and when the evening shadows gather around our hearthstone, and I look upon your onward progress towards the goal on which my heart has been fixed from your earliest infancy, I forget in my joy that I have toiled through the day, and at morn rise up, thanking God that I am spared in the vigor of my manhood to pursue this one great heart-desire."</p> 
               <p>A proud loving light lay on that mother's brow, as her eye rested on her lovely spirited children and their noble father, and she too forgot all the many comforts she had deprived herself of, that she might keep her children under her watchful eye. She might have done as others of her station in life did-put the little things from her as soon as they were old enough to earn their board; but her heart revolted at the thought of her nurselings being exposed while so young to the caprices of others, and she, like her husband, had resolved to cling to them until their growth was established together, with sound moral principles.</p> 
               <p>There is not a more sublime, ennobling spectacle, than that of a father, without a dollar save what he earns by<pb n=""/> daily labor, surrounded by a large group of children, battling with the world bravely, cheerfully, that they-his loved ones, may remain by him; that when eventide draws near he may bask in their childish glee and instil into their pliant minds the principles of truth and integrity. The rise and fall of nations and empires disturb him not, nor yet the throes of nature as she is rocked by convulsions. His children are his world, their welfare the bounds of his ambition. Thrice happier is he in his simple faith, which acknowledges the right with submission and awe, but spurns the wrong with disgust and horror, than the Arch-Bishop with the vast appliances of power delegated to him by his foreign master.</p>

               <argument> 
                  <p>Close of the year-A scene in Boston-Death-bed of a wealthy citizen-He is watched by a Friar-The Friar forges a will deeding his property to the Church-Strange developments-Effects of the Arch-Bishop's Circular-Duplicity and hypocrisy of the Friar-Exciting condition of affairs-Secret workings of Jesuitism-Approval of the Arch-Bishop.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>THE year of 1843 was closing. Already the crown was prepared to deck the brow of its successor-to wreath the curling locks of the new year. Laden with the accumulated woes of the twelve months which, in that short period had changed him from hale youth to decrepid age, the hoary monarch, crowned by time with a diadem in which a thorn is placed, that whose brow it presses shrivels, pales, and dies. Alas! the diadem is death-the handmaiden that waits closely on the footsteps of time.</p> 
               <p>Near the close of the year, in Boston, lay an old man in the last agonies of death. The roof that covered him was supported by marble columns-the bed on which he was breathing out his life, was draped with Eastern fabric, while tufted carpets from the same shores, broke the foot-falls of his attendant, for there was but one, and he dressed in the garb of a Friar, hung over him with his finger on the expiring pulse, and a glittering, triumphant light<pb n=""/> in his eye. The glassy eye at last slowly closed, a tremor ran through the pulse, and all was still.</p> 
               <p>"Thank Heaven! he is gone at last, and all is saved!" laughed the Friar, as he rubbed his hands in glee, where but a moment before his whole bearing had been one of deep solemnity and grief.</p> 
               <p>The breast of the man heaved, and rousing himself half out of his bed, while the Friar uttering a cry of terror shrank back, said in a full strong voice, as he reached forth his hand-</p> 
               <p>"I think I have slept, Father. I am refreshed and can look at that paper now-hand it to me; I must be sure it is all right."</p> 
               <p>"I have made quite sure of that; the repose of the souls of the dear departed were too precious to be trifled with-you can see, we never err"-and he placed a piece of parchment in the old man's hand." (See Note 25.)</p> 
               <p>"Father," said he, raising his worn and shriveled form, which the Friar had thought but a moment before was clay, in an upright position, the expiring spark of life bursting out into a flame-"I have had a glimpse of the dim future, and there, crowned and with smiles beckoning me to her, I saw my daughter-my lost Cecelia. When I stood by her side, she pointed back to earth, and said, sorrowfully, 'Visit not on my daughter the disobedience of her mother.' Following her direction there-in a wretched<pb n="90-91 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5770-00000045"/> dungeon I saw her daughter-the only being in whose veins this old blood flows. To her I leave my wealth, and thus perform an act of justice, I believed an hour ago, it out of my power to do;" and, as he spoke, he tore the parchment he held in his hands into shreds, and then sank slowly back on his pillow. Ghastly and pale as the dying man, and with eyes flashing with baffled rage, the Friar saw his schemes demolished, and the fabric that avarice had reared crumbled into dust.</p> 
               <p>"My son," said he, laying his hand roughly on the old man's shoulder, "this is the device of the Evil One who howls in rage, that you have provided the means of freeing your daughter's soul from purgatory, whom your anger drove into crime until she died, her soul steeped in guilt. She never had a child, nor even was she ever wedded to ALBERT MORETON, for whom she fled your house and heart. The Devil has done this; but we will yet baffle him by rewriting this will. Thanks to the Holy Virgin, for your returning strength!"</p> 
               <p>But the old man spoke not; moved not-although the Friar shook him roughly and shouted in his ear. The flickering light had expired. Frederick Levering, the man of boundless wealth, and a bleeding heart, was dead, with an act of justice too late performed, to shield his daughter from want, or even snatch his beautiful but misguided granddaughter, Cecelia Moreton-better known as Sister Mary-from a loathsome dungeon.</p>

               <p>What mattered it to her, that three millions of dollars were at her disposal, so long as she knew it not? It could not then change her mouldy crust of bread for more savory fare, or give her even the free air of Heaven in which to move or breathe. She knew that some day immense wealth would be hers; this she had learned from the lips of her dying mother, as well as the source whence she was entitled to it. Her gentle, confiding mother bade her be patient, assuring her that her father would in time forgive her disobedience in wedding the handsome, but penniless Albert Moreton. The Friar knew it was not the truth, when he told the old man they were never married, and this last sorrow run over the cup already too full, although at that moment the Friar would have saved his life at any sacrifice-a life he had so lately thanked Heaven when he thought it extinct. Carefully locking the door, the Friar gathered up the pieces of paper, cursing the lifeless clay before him, as he saw how futile would be his efforts to use them as they were.</p> 
               <p>"Short sighted imbecile!" he cried "I was, to trust the precious paper in his hands! As the case now stands, this city will inherit all this wealth, pampered as it is by heretics whose hands are already reeking with the unpunished sacrilege of the Ursuline Convent, on Mount Benedict, by its heretic hordes whom it sent out to sack and burn it."</p> 
               <p>"No, no;" he continued, "it shall never be. No one<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5770-00000047"/> but myself knows of the destruction of this will, and I can easily imitate his hand, so as to replace it. There is no crime in this, as it will secure this wealth to the Church, which would otherwise go to swell the arrogance of the heretics. Cecelia Moreton is dead to the world, and will be so forever, as the Arch-Bishop informs me. He will, whether she lives or dies, take care that she never finds out that her grandfather is dead or even ever forgave her mother. There is nothing to fear from her; but much from the heretics, if it is once known he destroyed the will which had already been signed and witnessed which gave the whole unreservedly to us."</p> 
               <p>Selecting a piece of paper of the same size and texture as the other, the Friar transcribed the torn will word for word from the pieces which he patiently joined together, accurately imitating the signatures, and when all was completed, he destroyed every trace of his criminal work, and then hastily rang the bell, and folding down the sheets bade the servants look upon their dead master. No one was surprised, for his death had for days been hourly expected, and with saddened hearts they looked upon that care-worn brow, for he had been a good master to them, some of whom had faithfully served him for years, and now they remembered that they must seek a new home, for they all believed the tale which had so long been rehearsed to the old man that their young mistress had died years ago childless.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The Friar outwardly wore a saddened aspect, suitable to the mournful occasion, but beneath this covering he exulted in his heart that he had wrested from the community this great wealth.</p> 
               <p>"This"-he wrote to the Arch-Bishop "is only a beginning, a tithe of the price the heretics shall pay for burning the Ursuline Convent. These three millions are but a drop in the bucket, and when the vast wealth of fifty such men has fallen into our hands the community shall, out of the public treasury, pay us the full value of the property destroyed, and thus publicly humble themselves before us, as a warning to all such outrages in future. When this is done, and <emph>not</emph> until then, I will be satisfied-although had I the power, a second St. Bartholomew should only wipe away the stain. May Holy St. Peter hasten the day when his successor shall reign over this land, and then these accumulated offences shall, at one fell blow, be blotted out by the hearts' blood of the heretics, and their broad lands and rich heritages be given to the faithful."</p> 
               <p>It certainly was a day's wonder to the sober, staid descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers, that one of their number should, forgetting the city of his nativity, the institutions in which he had passed his days of boyhood, and the years of his dawning manhood, and even the faith of his fathers, leave all his vast wealth to support the faith that, with a bloody drawn sword, drove his ancestors from over the sea to this then wild shore-a faith that he had in the<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5770-00000048"/> vigor of his manhood turned from with loathing and disgust for its charlatanism and immorality, whose institutions had never done him or his a service. They had all heard and believed that the old man's daughter-his only child-had died childless. Had they traced these tales they would have found their origin in the Arch-Bishop, who had learned from Mrs. Moreton that she, the only daughter of Frederick Levering, would one day inherit all his wealth, if he forgave her. Her husband was already dead, and the seeds of consumption sown in the constitutions of so many of our fairest daughters, in her were already bearing their hectic fruits, and she knew she too must soon die. Then she gladly placed her beautiful young daughter in the Convent which was under the auspices of the Arch-Bishop who, as soon as the grave had closed over the mother, barred the Convent gates to the egress of the daughter, resolving that the world should never know her more. From it she was transfered to the Arch-Bishop's palace, at his pleasure to be again brought back in chains, when her impatient spirit braved that of her master.</p> 
               <p>For years had the Friar, the emissary of the Arch-Bishop, hovered around the footsteps of the feeble old man, ingratiating himself into his favor by degrees, until he perverted his enfeebled intellect by tales of infamy and falsehood, through his cruelty to which his daughter had been driven, and finally pictured a horrible death, and concluded by assuring him his child was even now suffering<pb n=""/> ing the torments of lost souls. Then he would change his tactics, and in an imperious tone demand justice to this daughter, that when he too should die, he might rest in peace.</p> 
               <p>"Give me your wealth and the gates of Paradise shall be opened to her lost soul, and you may again see and know her in bliss in the world to come."</p> 
               <p>Levering was bowed by age and grief, in that he had not taken his erring daughter back to his heart; and believing none of his kindred lived to inherit his wealth, and thinking only of the lost one, he willingly executed the will that gave every dollar to the Church, for masses for his daughter's soul, which the Friar assured him, was yet scarcely enough to wipe away the enormity of her crimes.</p> 
               <p>Do the dead re-visit us? Can the purified spirits of those who have gone before come back to earth, and breathe encouragement or warning into our hearts? Is there a link still between mortality and immortality? If not, what was it that came to the dying Levering while he hovered on the confines of eternity and gave him a sight of a grandchild he knew not existed before? That warned him, even as the vital spark was expiring, to perform that last great act of justice which was all at this late hour that lay in his power to do? Whatever it was, the dying man bowed to its mandate, and then felt he never had a right to punish an error that his Maker forgave, and knew, as he looked upon the angelic face of his spirit-child<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5770-00000049"/> child, that his crime was the greater, and had more need of forgiveness of the two. In that solemn moment he realized how futile and unmeaning were all the pretences of the Friar, and how cunning and criminal his devices had been to wrest from the rightful owner his vast wealth, that it might build and spread still higher and broader the Juggernaut that was rolling along, leaving in its track the mangled and bloody forms of what had once borne the resemblance of the Creator.</p>

               <argument> 
                  <p>Effects of the Circular elsewhere-Appeals to the Arch-Bishop to abate the rigor of his demands unlistened to-Father FRANCIS sent as a missionary to St. Louis-His success in establishing a Church-His surprise at the Circular-He refuses to obey its injunctions-Measures taken by the Arch-Bishop to compel compliance with his orders.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>WHILST the above scenes were transpiring along the Atlantic coast, no less important ones were being enacted in other sections of the Union, until one long defiant cry, at first faint and low, as the muttering of an approaching tempest, but which swelled louder and fiercer until it filled the Union, and that cry was, "Our <emph>rights</emph> are in danger! Our children in harmony no longer con their lessons! The Bibles we have possessed for years are being taken from us; and those that resist are stricken suddenly by death, or disappear, and their places are vacant, or else a fatality pursues all their undertakings! Is the hand of God or man against us? Why have we provoked the wrath of either? Spare us, oh Heaven! lest life becomes a burthen! Spare us, brothers, lest provoked beyond endurance, we lift our hands against you!"</p> 
               <p>Every wail that came from afar, every paragraph of the<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5770-00000050"/> Press that chronicled an outrage of the Priests on their defenceless flocks, fell on the ears of the Arch-Bishop like soft strains of melody. To him it was one step nearer the prize, and as he looked on his breast swelled with an ambition which the groans and sighs of the oppressed, and the sturdy defiance of others, strengthened in its purpose.</p> 
               <p>Many of the shepherds, in the name of their flocks, appealed to him to abate the rigor of his Circulars; but to them his only answer was: "Obey, or incur the penalty of the oath you have taken." That fearful oath! They remembered it, and were dumb while they led on their flock to the precipice whence there is no escape from servitude and death.</p> 
               <p>Father FRANCIS had been educated as a missionary by the Catholic Church, and, under the auspices of the Arch-Bishop, was sent to gather together and form into a flock the scattered Catholics along the river banks of St. Louis. He was devoted to his task and in a short time he had gathered in unity about one hundred men, women, and children; who, by their voluntary contributions, reared a small neat chapel, in which they worshipped. Year after year the flock gradually increased, and also gradually the aspect and character of the flock changed. At first, the men were rough, the women bold and coarse, and the children boisterous and rude. Under the mild, gentle eye of Father FRANCIS the men became mannerly, the women<pb n=""/> gentle and modest, and the children with their smooth curls, chubby faces, clean tow frocks and bare feet, grew absolutely lovely. Never was man better qualified for his task, and never was man better loved than he. His time, his talents, his all he freely gave for their welfare, and found his reward in the happy renovation he had caused. This was all the reward he, year after year, received; for he and his flock were alike for the time forgotten in the whirl and excitement of his superiors.</p> 
               <p>Well had it been for him and his charge if they had ceased altogether to remember him; but his name and station were on their list, and in the package of Circulars received by the Bishop of St. Louis from the Arch-Bishop, one was found for Father Francis and sent to him.</p> 
               <p>With sorrow and regret he received the Circular; for, when he came to his flock he came Bible in hand, and weekly taught from its sacred pages, and had ever encouraged his people to peruse it, and drink thence eternal life. The simple sacred precepts there found had become very dear to his people. How then could he snatch from their hands the staff that he had placed there for them to lean upon? How command them to detain their children from the Public Schools at which he had labored so long to procure their punctual attendance!</p> 
               <p>"I will remonstrate with the Bishop, and my people, perhaps, if he yields, will never know of the threatened storms that hang above them."</p> 
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5770-00000051"/> 
               <p>The Bishop was alone when he entered, and in no gentle mood, for another man had just left him who came to appeal to him, to prevent his children from being denied the benefits of the Common Schools. He had parted from this man in anger, and was brooding over it when Father Francis was announced. On making known his errand, the Bishop cried in a passion-</p> 
               <p>"Faithless traitor! do you dare dictate to your superiors? It is men like you, false to the interests of the Church, that cause dissensions and trouble! Away to your post and there learn that obedience is the A, B, C, to Catholicism!"</p> 
               <p>Father Francis stood silent and immovable, until the Bishop's passion was spent, then said mildly-</p> 
               <p>"My Lord, you charge me wrongfully in accusing me of being false to our Holy Faith-for on it I rest my happiness here, my hopes of Heaven hereafter. It was for her interest that I came to you: I can not bid them undo all I have spent years in accomplishing. It would be inconsistent, unjust-the vitality of my flock would be shaken by it, and they would fall back to the half civilized beings I found them, were I to carry out this command."</p> 
               <p>"Better be savages than a single order of the Church be disobeyed," retorted the Bishop impatiently.</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my Lord, our Saviour taught not thus. And as an humble follower and teacher of the Saviour, I dare not teach such doctrine."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Ha!" cried the Bishop, "we not only have a traitor, but a heretic among us. Let me give you a warning, for I must see to this. Next Sabbath morning, while your people are assembled, communicate to them the Circular, backed by an urgent discourse of obedience of it to the very letter, and in the following week, visit every house and see that it is carried into effect! If you fail to do this, the Church knows how to punish disobedience!"</p> 
               <p>"Criminal disobedience, but not conscientious disobedience," returned Father Francis, in a tone of energy and decision.</p> 
               <p>"All disobedience to her mandates are criminal; for she is the mother of all right and cannot err!"</p> 
               <p>"Nevertheless, she has, in years gone by, and is as liable to err again!"</p> 
               <p>"Said I not, you were a heretic? By the Holy Virgin, a little wholesome discipline would not come amiss on you!" cried the Bishop in angry tones.</p> 
               <p>Father Francis bowed meekly before his superior's anger, and when it had passed away, said mildly-</p> 
               <p>"I must again protest, my lord, against being called a heretic. The very name fills my soul with horror," and he crossed himself reverently, and as he spoke a slight tremor in his voice attested his sincerity.</p> 
               <p>"Prove it, then, by obedience to the commands of the Church. She asks nothing more than implicit obedience,"<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5770-00000052"/> returned the Bishop as he strode from the room leaving his brother alone. (See Note 26.)</p> 
               <p>With a pained and troubled heart Father Francis left the princely abode of the Bishop, and sought his own humble lodgings. Shutting himself in his only private room, on the bare floor before a wooden crucifix he prayed all through the long hours of the night for strength to support and direct him in the path of right and duty. When the sun arose he came forth calm and with an ineffably peaceful light resting upon his brow. There was no trace of the bitter agony of the soul with which he had passed through the night, but like the summer sky, purified by the fierce warring of the elements, he was calm, quieter than before, for the night's agony had cleansed his heart from every sordid emotion, and, as when he first dedicated himself to his labor, he felt that he was his Creator's servant to do his bidding only.</p> 
               <p>The succeeding Sabbath found him unchanged among his flock where, after going through the usual devotional services, he in a clear, concise manner read the contents of the Arch-Bishop's Circular to them. It was received with looks of blank astonishment by the congregation, accompanied by low whispered words of dissatisfaction. After laying the matter before them, he knelt and with the crucifix he always wore pressed to his lips, he prayed silently, long and fervently. He had seen in his people's flashing eyes what he had feared, and before a word was<pb n=""/> spoken he knew they would assert their rights as citizens, defy the Bishop, and continue on in their present course. He knew he had unbounded influence over them, and could probably, in length of time, eradicate the good seed he had sown so prayerfully, tearfully-but he could not do <emph>this,</emph> all the holy, manly feeling of his nature forbade it.</p> 
               <p>Still he shrunk from a contest with his superiors, which he knew from antecedents he would be worsted in, although he went covered with the strong armour of truth and justice. Yet in his simple, unostentatious life of doing good to his fellows, he had not learned all that followed an act of disobedience-that, alas! was never known by those beneath a Bishop's mitre and his emissaries. When he arose from his devotions he saw the cloud gathering blacker and fiercer among his people. Still he spoke not, when a sturdy waterman arose and said-</p> 
               <p>"Please, your Reverence, I know I am ignorant, unlearned and unfit to be spokesman-but they say I must tell you what we all think of these doings. We can't one of us read, and until you come among us, not one of our children could. You have shown us the path by which we may raise our children to become good, respectable, and valuable members of society, and now we have learned to love the pleasant road, and see far away in the future our childern blessing us, because we listened to your words and rescued them from the degradation of our early lives. The Bible you have often told us, was<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5770-00000053"/> the key that opened the way to Heaven, to God. We know you told us true, for we have listened to its words prayerfully, and felt in our hearts the gifts of love, peace and good will to all men. Take not from us the light that lures us to Heaven, lest we fall back in our ways and again curse man and the God who made us!"</p> 
               <p>The waterman sat down. He had been calm while speaking, but now his head was bowed and his stout frame convulsed, and, trembling, showed how hard to him had been his task.</p> 
               <p>Father Francis gazed sorrowfully at his flock for a moment, then rose slowly as if he too was about to perform an unwilling task, and said-</p> 
               <p>"My children, these mandates that I have laid before you, originated not with me-nay, I disapprove them-they are the commands of our superiors in the Church. For what purpose they were sent forth I cannot divine-I have fulfiled my duty to the Church in laying them before you. Still I feel my duty to you, to myself, and to my God, is not wholly discharged until I warn you to hold fast to your Bibles, if you would have the living grace of our Divine Master in your hearts, and that your duty to your children and society demands of you, that your children be prepared to take their proper places as citizens in the great arena of the future."</p> 
               <p>As Father Francis concluded this sentence his eye, as it wandered over his flock, encountered the cold stern look <unclear>of</unclear>
                  <pb n=""/> the Bishop who had been an unseen witness to their proceedings, fixed upon him.</p> 
               <p>Had a thunderbolt come at that moment through their Chapel and exploded at their feet, he could not have been more surprised. It was the first visit of his Grace, and too well Father Francis knew his coming thus unannounced and silently boded no good.</p> 
               <p>"My Brother!" said the Bishop blandly as he advanced up to his stand, "you hardly have done the mandates of our Holy Church justice. Allow me to address your charge a few words"-and without giving Father Francis a chance to reply, he launched forth in a tirade against free schools, a free press-and the reading of the Scriptures, and ended by assuring them, all the anarchy and confusion that ever disturbed the world, had arisen from this cause.</p> 
               <p>Dismissing the flock he politely, but in a manner that forbid a refusal, requested him to dine with him.</p> 
               <p>Father Francis assented, and as they wended their way to the Bishop's abode, endeavored to interest his superior in the little band under his control. He was cut short in this by the Bishop, who said in a tone of displeasure-</p> 
               <p>"How is this that, with a congregation of two hundred, you have never paid any funds into the Church treasury? By this time you ought to have collected five thousand dollars for that purpose."</p> 
               <p>"Consider, my Lord, how poor they all are," remonstrated Father Francis, deprecatingly.</p> 
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5770-00000054"/> 
               <p>"Poor! why even the children wore shoes and hats-you had no right to foster such extravagance at the expense of the Church. Had you been a faithful Shepherd, you might have had now a handsome sum to contribute to the overthrow of the heretics." (See Note 27.)</p> 
               <p>"The richest of them never dreamed of possessing so large a sum, my Lord, and many of them are unable to work and have to be supported by those who can-they are very generous and give freely all they can spare, but that is no more than will keep the Chapel in order and pay the current expenses."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not, under your care, but under a more faithful Shepherd they may be taught to consider the good of the Church of paramount importance."</p> 
               <p>"Another shepherd! Surely, my Lord, you will not give my flock, which I have learned to love so well, into the care of another. We have been very happy together, and I fear a change would be detrimental," returned Father Francis, aghast at the ominous words of his superior, who he well knew had the power, if he desired, to separate him from his charge.</p> 
               <p>"My Brother forgets the good of the whole in a selfish love for one," returned the Bishop ironically</p> 
               <p>Father Francis saw how futile would be further remonstrance, and was silent. His heart was rent with conflicting emotions, which was augmented by the stern, cold demeanor of his superior. He watched the minutes that<pb n=""/> dragged lazily along, for the time to arrive when he could, without appearing in haste, once more go out in the free air to his own humble house-to his children whom he well knew were awaiting him with open arms and a blessing on their lips.</p> 
               <p>The Bishop evidently enjoyed his uneasiness, for he rarely withdrew his keen cold eyes from his face, and occasionally a half smile, half sneer, wreathed his lips, as the conscious blood dyed his brow, or receding, left it white and dewy with mental torture.</p> 
               <p>The hours passed and the shades of evening began to gather around when, with words gentle as his soul within, he arose to leave.</p> 
               <p>"No:" said the Bishop sternly, "you cannot leave!-you are my prisoner until you answer the charges against you before the tribunal of the Holy Church!"</p> 
               <p>"My Lord-"</p> 
               <p>"Silence, and obey!" cried his superior imperiously, as he stamped thrice on the floor.</p> 
               <p>Father Francis bowed silently, and in an instant he felt his arms grasped and pinioned, and turning suddenly he confronted two men masked, and clad in a close fitting dress of black.</p> 
               <p>Silently they led him from the room to one beneath, but equally as luxurious, and leaving him, closed the door and took up their position on the outside. Scarcely an hour<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5770-00000055"/> had elapsed, and before he could collect his astounded senses, the door opened and the Bishop entered.</p> 
               <p>"I have come," said he, "to comfort you in the trials you have called down upon yourself, and to give you some wholesome advice for the future. You have uttered and taught what is heretical, and must be tried by your superiors. If you are pure and true to your oath, you will only be the gainer by the ordeal. Are you willing to proceed to the place designated?"</p> 
               <p>"I am willing to abide by the decision of my brethren; but why leave St. Louis for the purpose? There are enough here to try me."</p> 
               <p>"There is no Ecclesiastical Court here, while one is already sitting in Vera Cruz, which can be reached within two weeks. If you proceed willingly, you will be liberated on the spot, but must embark within the hour-otherwise you prejudice the Court against you by an opposition that will be unavailing."</p> 
               <p>"I will go," sadly but firmly returned Father Francis, scarcely comprehending the import of all that had transpired.</p> 
               <p>Instantly the Bishop loosened the fetters and with a smile of encouragement said-</p> 
               <p>"I doubt not but that you will yet become an ornament to our Order. You, like many others, forget the great work that every other thing must be sacrificed to the accomplishment of, and get led away and turned from your<pb n=""/> purpose by your sympathies. This should not be: we must be true to our purpose, and all will then be well. Go to those appointed to judge you voluntarily, and it will be much in your favor."</p> 
               <p>"How shall I know them? Where shall I find them?" inquired Father Francis, dubiously.</p> 
               <p>"Go to Vera Cruz, and, when you land, and a person approaches you saying, 'I have waited for you,' follow him silently, wherever he leads. Farewell, my Brother, I hope to meet you in future purified from every error!" So saying, the Bishop went out, leaving his victim alone, and scarcely realizing that the whole was not some troubled dream.</p> 
            </div>

               <argument> 
                  <p>Father Francis brought forth and taken to the wharf, where he was put on board a vessel-He leaves, in company with two men, for Vera Cruz-He is confined, arraigned before an Inquisitorial Court, sentenced, and tortured-His absence from his charge creates great excitement-They know not his whereabouts-His sufferings, and death-Escape of a Familiar.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>WITHIN the hour the two men that had fettered him came in, and silently motioned him to follow. Mechanically he obeyed, and soon the three stood on the wharf, where a boat lay with her gang plank ready to withdraw. Over this they passed to the boat-the cordage was loosed, and the Indian Queen swung out into the Mississippi, and heading southward, bore them on to New Orleans.</p> 
               <p>There was no restraint over the movements of Father Francis by the two men that accompanied him; but he felt that he was none the less a prisoner; for wherever he went on the boat they were by his side. They were now unmasked and he attempted to converse with them on indifferent topics, but if they heard him they gave no sign that such was the case, but still they silently and unobtrusively, spoke to no one, and gave no heed when others addressed them. Neither could Father Francis catch the expression of their eyes, which were downcast and as unvarying as<pb n=""/> the rigid muscles of their features. Who and what were they who thus followed him noiselessly, like his shadow? That they were in the employ of the Bishop, he well knew; but what right had they to guard him as if he were a felon? His offence was not against any civil law of his country, and he well knew he was not compelled to answer to the Church for any charge it might prefer against him, unless he chose to. Still his sense of the right of Church government forbade him to demur against a Superior's command and, therefore, he obeyed. To go guarded as a criminal hurt his high toned sense of right, and galled his honest pride. A conscious life of rectitude, and the certainty that any charge against him could be refuted, bore up his courage, and strengthened him in his singular and trying situation. In safety they reached New Orleans where they embarked on a trading vessel for Vera Cruz.</p> 
               <p>He reached his destination-but all was new and strange, and he involuntarily looked around to follow in the footsteps of the two singular beings under whose surveillance he felt the journey had been made. To his astonishment they had disappeared, and with a feeling of relief he passed on, but before he had gone half a square a stranger touched him on the shoulder and said-"I have waited for you;" and instantly the words of the Bishop flashed on his mind, and he returned-</p> 
               <p>"Lead on, and I will follow."</p> 
               <p>On, on they went through broad streets, and anon in<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5770-00000057"/> dark, narrow alleys, whence they again emerged among palatial abodes, until Father Francis accustomed as he was to fatigue, tottered with exhaustion. Not a word had been exchanged between them, and but for the commands of his Bishop "To follow wherever he led," he would have refused to go farther, for he liked not the ruffian-like bearing of his leader. At last the guide approached a close carriage in waiting at the corner of a street, and opening the door motioned him to enter. Obeying he found seated within, to his astonishment, the two emissaries of the Bishop, who had accompanied him down the river. His guide closed the door, and mounting the box, they were whirled rapidly away. Where he knew not, for the intricacies of the city were a chaos to him, and had the carriage been open he would have been little wiser in what direction he was being carried.</p> 
               <p>Hour after hour passed, and still the coach whirled on, and the shades of night were already gathered darkly around, when it stopped, the door was opened, and his two fellow travellers alighted and motioned him to follow. Then he saw that they were in the suburbs of the city, which lay glittering with its thousand lights below them. He caught but a glance at the heavy imposing structure, as the three who had him in charge beckoned him peremptorily to follow; but he saw it was large and grand, supported by turrets and crowned by a dome, high above which glistened a massive gilded Cross.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The portal quickly closed behind him, and he was conducted through the hall into a small richly furnished room, and left alone, but only for a few minutes. The door opened to admit two men wearing the garb of the Mutes of the Inquisition! With a shudder of horror, mingled with terror and dismay, he surveyed these emissaries; for he knew now when it was too late to avail himself of the knowledge that, even his innocence, might never again unclose that dread portal, and send him out to breathe the air of Heaven. He knew the Ecclesiastical Court was in full force in America. But he knew not that any except hardened reprobates were subject to its laws. He felt that he was innocent of any offence against God or man, and that he was on his way to the Inquisition's dark abodes, had never entered his thoughts.</p> 
               <p>The Mutes gave him no time for thought. They quickly rolled away a heavy divan, folded back the tufted carpet that covered the floor beneath where it stood, and pressing a piece of the flooring, a trap door was disclosed. Beneath was seen a narrow flight of stairs which led to-Father Francis shuddered to think-where? One of these Mutes went down first, the other motioning the victim to follow. He obeyed, and the other following, the three wound down the dark damp way, until they came to a small dismal vault. Here one of the Mutes lighted a torch, and leading the way through a narrow passage, paused before a door which he unlocked, thrust their astounded<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5770-00000058"/> tounded victim in, and relocking it, left him alone in total darkness.</p> 
               <p>Stunned and suffocated by the foul air engendered in the damp, noisome cell, he sank helpless and despairing on the cold floor. How long he lay there he knew not-time to him was a blank-and oft he passed his hand over his throbbing temples, and wondered if it would ever be otherwise. He tried to think-to realize his perilous position-but his senses refused their aid! All the incidents that had transpired from the reception of the Arch-Bishop's Circular, up to the present moment, seemed like black, eddying waters whirling around and around, and in their dizzy course his brain reeled and his heart grew still and cold. He tried to pray; and as his lips uttered the words they fell mockingly on his heart so dead, so unmeaning and chill that, with a wild cry of despair, he sank back uttering wild, incoherent words of deprecating prayer. Nature at last became exhausted, and he sank away into a troubled sleep, from which he was aroused by a key grating in the lock of his cell door which, in a moment opened a few inches and something, he could not tell what, was thrust within. The door was again closed and locked as before. Groping his way along, he found a pitcher of water and a crust of dry bread. He drank deeply of the water, for he was parched with thirst, but he could not eat the bread, and turned from it with loathing. Feeling his way along the walls, he found his cell about six<pb n=""/> feet square, without furniture, unless a large massive chain, one end let into the wall by a heavy ring, could be called furniture. Father Francis shuddered as he felt the solid links from end to end, and wondered if there ever had been a human being chained there, or, if there had, whether he was innocent of the offences with which he was charged, and his heart sickened at the thought that it might be even so. (See Note 28.)</p> 
               <p>A few days were spent thus. He knew not how long; for days and nights were alike to him. Not once during this time, had the sound of a human voice fallen on his ears; not once had his eye been greeted by a ray of light. Its intensity had settled, like a pall, around him, and he felt in his soul that it was crushing him. Could he have basked in the light of day, and breathed the free air, all other deprivations could have been borne with resignation to the mandates of his Superior. But he felt that, no one had a right to treat his brother, be he ever so guilty, with such a living torture, deprived of every blessing the God of nature had freely vouchsafed to all. During these days of the keenest agony to the sensitive soul of Father Francis, he had learned to eat even the stale crust of bread that was daily thrown to him, as if he had been a dog; he had also become composed so as to think calmly and pray fervently, and, the light and peace that belongs to the pure in heart and contrite in spirit his persecutors could not deprive him of, for it came alike from, and<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5770-00000059"/> was with God. Perhaps his enemies deemed his living death had subdued him, for they ordered him brought before them, and he was led out by the stern Mutes through a narrow passage which opened by a door into a long, wide corridor. This corridor was lighted with candles, the rays of which seemed to burn into the very brain of the prisoner, whose eyes had so long been deprived of every ray of light. Yet he felt a pleasant sensation stealing over him, as it burst blindingly upon him-it seemed so human, so lifelike. On the opposite side of the corridor from where he entered, were a number of doors over the first of which was this inscription: <q>
                     <p>"NONE ENTER THIS DOOR EXCEPT UNDER SENTENCE OF THE QUESTION."</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Over the door to the right of this was also inscribed: <q>
                     <p>"THE FIRST INQUISITOR."</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>At the left, over another door, he read the sentence: <q>
                     <p>"THE SECOND INQUISITOR."</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>And before he could see what was inscribed over doors still beyond these, he was hurried through the door of "the first Inquisitor," when he found himself in a large apartment hung in black draperies, with a dais raised on one side covered also with black, upon which three men were seated, dressed in flowing robes of the same sable hue; upon the breast of each one was painted a flaming red Cross. They also wore the Inquisitor's cap, beneath<pb n=""/> which streamed their long wiry hair. At the foot of the dais was a circular table, around which three Secretaries sat, and these, with four Familiars ranged on the right and left of the Inquisitors, with bared swords, constituted the Ecclesiastical Court, the highest tribunal of the Holy Catholic Church. Father Francis was led to a large immovable iron chair, which occupied the space before them, and being seated therein was left alone, wondering where all these things would end, and when he should again quit the gloomy walls for the bright free world without.</p> 
               <p>"Francis, Priest of St. Louis, have you humbled yourself before the Saints and the Holy Mother Church, and are you prepared to acknowledge your faults, and sue for forgiveness, while the door of mercy is still unclosed?" demanded one of the Inquisitors.</p> 
               <p>"If I have unwittingly sinned against the Church I will with all humility, make amends, if I am informed of what they consist; and in justice, my Lords, I demand to meet my accuser face to face."</p> 
               <p>"You have not been brought here for argument or contention, and any obduracy on your part will only augment the already heavy load of crimes that rests upon you. Again, I demand, will you confess and repent your guilt?"</p> 
               <p>"What shall I confess, my Lord? God is my witness that I have never knowingly sinned against the Holy Catholic Church, or my fellow man!"</p> 
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5770-00000060"/> 
               <p>"Obdurate man! has the Evil One so hardened you?"</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my Lord, I know not yet of what I am accused."</p> 
               <p>"Ask your own heart! Have you forgotten your oath?"</p> 
               <p>"No, my Lord; neither have I ever broken it. I have preserved it inviolate."</p> 
               <p>"Contumacious! False shepherd! There are ways to overcome this obstinacy! Do you still refuse to confess your crimes?"</p> 
               <p>"To my knowledge, I never committed any. If I have done so ignorantly, bring forward my accuser, and let him name them."</p> 
               <p>"Take him to the rack!" thundered the Inquisitor, enraged; and he was dragged away before he could remonstrate, by the Familiars, and he perceived that he was to be taken into the room over the door of which were the ominous words: <q>
                     <p>"NONE ENTER THIS DOOR EXCEPT UNDER SENTENCE OF THE QUESTION."</p>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Not a word was spoken by his keepers, who seated him on a low iron rack, threw him prostrate upon it, and bound him firmly with cords. They then took their positions, part at the head, and the rest at his feet, and at a signal from them a Dominican Monk approached and said-</p> 
               <p>"Though your crime was of the darkest dye, and your soul steeped in guilt, the Holy Church in the plenitude of her mercy, will yet forgive, and you can go forth free<pb n=""/> and purified from every stain, if you humble yourself and confess your guilt."</p> 
               <p>"Tell me, my brother, as you hope for Heaven," said Father Francis, eagerly, "of what am I charged?"</p> 
               <p>As these words fell from his lips, the Familiars, at a sign from the Monk, pressed down the levers they held in their hands, the rack widened, elongated, and with one piercing cry of human agony, the blood oozed from a dozen fractured muscles, as he gasped and fainted under the "<emph>question.</emph>" (See Note 29.)</p> 
               <p>When consciousness again returned, he was alone in his dark cell, laying on the damp, cold flags. How long he had lain thus he knew not; but when he attempted to move he screamed with pain, and as he finally slowly passed his hand over himself he found his garments saturated with clotted gore. A burning thirst was consuming him, and when by painful efforts he reached his pitcher, there were but a few drops of water in it.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, God!" he cried, in the agony of his soul, "is there no pity in the hearts of thy creatures, to feel for the pain of their fellows? Oh! Holy Mother Church, are there, then crimes like this committed in thy name? Why is it that innocent persons suffer a torture prepared for those on whom every other method has been exercised without avail?"</p> 
               <p>The hours passed slowly along in this double torture of thirst and pain, when his pitcher was again filled and a<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5770-00000061"/> crust thrown him. Never tasted water sweeter to the desert wanderer than that to him. A troubled sleep followed it, and when he awoke he felt less pain, and knew that a healthy constitution was asserting her supremacy over him.</p> 
               <p>Three days elapsed when, pale, drooping and so haggard that not one of those of his flock, who far away, were praying so tearfully for his safety would, in him have recognized their beloved shepherd. Father Francis was carried before the Inquisitors, and once more seated in the Iron Chair.</p> 
               <p>"Francis, Priest of St. Louis, have you repented of your obduracy? and are you ready to confess the justice of the punishment you have called upon yourself, by your disobedience and crimes?"</p> 
               <p>"As you hope for mercy in the world to come, my Lord, I pray you tell me of what I am charged, for I have searched my heart and in it found no disloyalty to the Holy Church, to God, or my fellow man," pleaded the victim in feeble tones</p> 
               <p>"Hast thou then, no fear of punishment? Methinks our servants have been over merciful, that you thus contemn our power," retorted the Inquisitor, with an angry, threatening glance to the Familiars, who turned pale, and trembled beneath his glance</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my Lord, behold my wounds, my gory garments!<pb n=""/> and see you not that I am weak and trembling?" said their victim mournfully.</p> 
               <p>"I see only that you are contumacious and will not confess your guilt, although the Church stands as ready to forgive as to punish, and I need scarcely tell you, she has power to do both!"</p> 
               <p>"I now as ever acknowledge it," returned Father Francis, "and if you bring my accuser before me, or show me in what my offence consists, I shall most gladly confess it."</p> 
               <p>"Your accuser cannot tell more than your own heart knows; and if that is not yet contrite, the consequences be on your own head-you have invoked them!"</p> 
               <p>"Then, God have mercy on me, for I know not what to confess!"</p> 
               <p>"Away to the rack with the reprobate who insults his God with his lips, while in his heart he mocks at the power of His Holy Earthly Spouse!"</p> 
               <p>He was again surrounded by the Familiars, dragged away, and his quivering limbs bound to the rack. The Familiars' hands were again on the lever, when the Monk a second time approaching him, said-</p> 
               <p>"Once more the Church comes to you with her never failing mercy-cease this warring with her power, for were your crimes hidden in the utmost recesses of your heart, she has the power to wrest it from its covering. Confess before it is too late. It is the Church in the name of God himself that commands you!"</p> 
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5770-00000062"/> 
               <p>"Oh, God! this is impious mockery! Have Thou, oh, my only helper in this hour of need, the mercy denied by my brethren?" cried the victim, as a cold clammy sweat started from every pore. The words had scarcely passed his lips when the levers were borne down again, and the cry of human agony was heard echoing like the wail of a lost soul along those vaults; and loosing the cords that bound him they bore his senseless form once more to his dark damp cell, and laying his bleeding body upon the hard stone, left him alone with his God.</p> 
               <p>A dim consciousness at last returned, but it was the flickering of the expiring life. He tried to think, to move, but at every effort relapsed into unconsciousness. Thus he was when the door opened, of which he scarcely had a perception, and a person entered closing and locking it within, when he produced a dark lantern, and kneeling by his side whispered soft soothing words in his ear. Had he then one friend within those dreadful walls! Could it be his tormenters had relented and believed his assertions of innocence? He tried in the gratitude of his heart for those gentle words, to speak, but alas! his tongue refused utterance. A cordial was applied to his lips which revived him and unclosing his eyes he, with a shudder, recognized one of the Familiars.</p> 
               <p>"Do not fear me, I am your friend, who, tired of this revolting butchery, have come to save you. I have brought you wine and strengthening food, salve for your wounds, and<pb n=""/> medicine to keep off your fever, and as soon as you can be removed, before the 'Question' is again put to you, I will save you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, God! Thou art indeed still mindful of me!" murmured the victim, fervently.</p> 
               <p>"You must gain strength as fast as possible, as I only await your recovery to leave these hated walls before any one else is put to the torture; for I feel every time I assist in this fiendish work, as if I myself was on the rack."</p> 
               <p>"Have others then suffered here?" asked Father Francis with astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"I wish there had not, in the name of mercy! Only last week one man, sent here from Cincinnati, charged with, I know not what, perished on the rack, before the eyes of the Grand Inquisitor, who held a lever himself; and only yesterday a beautiful young girl entered these walls never, I know by antecedents, to leave again in life or death.</p> 
               <p>"This is almost past belief. Except among the Order of Loyola, the Inquisition is not known to exist in North America!"</p> 
               <p>"And for that very reason their acts are never known, never inquired into," replied the Familiar. "Still I have often wondered that we were not found out, for there is scarcely a week in the year but that in some State in the Union, a man or woman is seized and hurried to its dungeons, while the credulous people content themselves by paragraphing the disappearance for a few weeks, and then forget<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5770-00000063"/> that such a person ever moved among them, while their victims are breathing their last beneath the torture, or perhaps doomed to wear out their lives in loathsome dungeons without even the form of a trial, or ever knowing of what they were accused. I loathe the office imposed upon me by my Superiors, and will escape, and in some corner of the Union, where no Jesuits have penetrated, end my days."</p> 
               <p>"Your name?"</p> 
               <p>"Martin Gaven, of Baltimore, originally, until lured into the Catholic Church, induced to take Holy Orders, and finally the oath of the Order of Loyola."</p> 
               <p>With many words of counsel the Familiar left him, appointing the third night from that time, as the one for flight. When once more alone a sweet, calm feeling stole over him, and he fancied himself again among his flock, breathing the pure air of life and freedom. The scene then rapidly changed, and soft whispering voices filled the air, and he deemed angels' wings fanned his brow and supported his weary body on their downy breasts, and in an ecstacy of repose his eyes closed-his heart grew still, and a placid smile hovered round his colorless lips. Father Francis had passed from death to life, from earth to God-<emph>he was dead!</emph> (See Note 30.)</p>

               <argument> 
                  <p>Propitious dawn of the year 1844 to the Arch-Bishop-Complete success of his schemes-His numerous sources of assistance-He convokes a General Council-Various preliminary arrangements-The Council convenes-The Arch-Bishop's inquiries-He receives cheering information-Numerous plans suggested to carry out the orders of the Pope-Awful state of affairs-Criminal revelations-Their shocking character-They please the Arch-Bishop-Determined resolutions-Speeches, remarks, threats, etc.-Results of the labors of the Convention.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>THE dawn that ushered in the year 1814 arose bright and clear upon the motley throng that crowded one of our metropolitan cities. And in all the bosoms that throbbed therein, there was not a more exulting heart than that which beat beneath the clerical vestments of the Arch-Bishop. The new year had brought with it the rapid fulfilment of his schemes. The St. Leopold, the political Order he had reared, had extended throughout every State in the Union, and was daily increasing in numbers. Every member of this Order was pledged to support for offices in the gift of the people, none but those who were Catholics, who would bind themselves to be amenable for their acts to him as the highest delegated authority from the Pope, in America, and to appoint none to subordinate offices in their gift but those whom he<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5770-00000064"/> should approve. The thousands of Catholic servants with which large cities abounded, together with those weekly landed on our shores from foreign climes, were immediately enrolled in this Order, until numberless domestic circles were harboring within their bosoms a serpent, whose fangs stung deeper, deadlier than the scorpion's. The Arch-Bishop was now prepared to step into the political arena, holding as he fondly anticipated, in his hand the balance of power, together with important domestic and political secrets he had obtained through the agents of his Order wherewith to check or intimidate his opponents. (See Notes 31, 32, and 33.)</p> 
               <p>The first General Convocation of the officers of this Order, was to take place at the Arch-Bishop's palace, on the first day of the new year. Their Grand Master and Creator now awaited their presence, not so much to hear their views as to impress his own upon them. One by one they came, and when the clock marked twelve, the door was closed against any delinquents, and they proceeded to business. (See Note 34.)</p> 
               <p>"I have summoned you," said the Arch-Bishop, "to lay before you what we have done; to call your attention to what has been left undone, as well as to form a unity of action in the future. Every hour from some section of the Union, arrive tidings of the workings of our Order, as well as many secrets which, with more activity, we can turn to our profit. For weeks past I have been<pb n=""/> silently probing politicians of both political parties, and have ascertained there are those among them who will willingly give us their pledge to use their influence in the legislative halls of the Union to have such laws and amendments to those already in existence enacted, as we shall propose, in consideration for the Catholic vote which, united with either of the great contending parties, would be triumphant; and once pledged they dare not betray us. Once in power, such reforms shall be wrought as will forever place us upon a footing whence we never can be driven. Our treasury is full to overflowing, and money can be used freely to gain this great point. We have wrested three millions from Boston, that sink of iniquity, and every dollar of this shall be lavished on that State alone, and it shall acknowledge our sway. I long for the day when that city shall, in sack-cloth and ashes, with her richest treasures for peace-offerings, sue at our feet for forgiveness for her outrages which she has committed against the chosen people of God." (See Notes 35 and 36.)</p> 
               <p>"Yes, her crimes are great," remonstrated one of the members; "but the rightful heiress of Levering still lives, and unless she gives her consent, the money of her Grandfather can be of no avail. According to the Friar's account, who was with him in his last hour, he obtained the will by no fair means."</p> 
               <p>"Who but the members of our Order knows this? Is then<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5770-00000065"/> the St. Leopold so impotent that she can not keep her members from babbling?"</p> 
               <p>"No, no; my Lord, I meant not that there was danger, but that we had better secure the right by concession of the heiress, which might easily be obtained, as she is already in our power."</p> 
               <p>"I know her better than you. She is intractable, and by going to her for her assent, we must inform her that her Grandfather is dead; and this would only bring investigation which would lead to no good result. I have found it necessary to enforce a mild restraint already upon her actions, which otherwise would have led to annoyance and trouble."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! I knew not of this. I supposed she was a simple devotee who could, by reason, be led into deeding the whole amount to our Order."</p> 
               <p>"And if she were, the heretics would find out her existence in its execution, and we should soon have a hue and cry raised around us. Were the secular power in our hands, this could be done without being noised among the heretics; but until that day comes, we must work silently and make the end justify the means."</p> 
               <p>"This affair is known only to the officers of our Order, and it is in our power to act as we think best. Have you further information from Father Francis, of St. Louis?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes: our Bishop there informs me he became a renegade, and was taken possession of by the Inquisition, and<pb n=""/> remaining contumacious beneath the "Question," the Devil seized him and bore him away before he confessed his guilt. A fate that awaits all who forfeit their lives by breaking the oath of our Order."</p> 
               <p>A shudder passed over the assembly as the Arch-Bishop announced the fate of a member of their Order. Perhaps they were weighing the chances they would run in the numberless acts they took the responsibility of, the knowledge of which they withheld from their Superior. Tyrants as they all were in their own Dioceses, they trembled before the Arch-Bishop, in whose hands their lives and liberty were quite as much at his mercy as Father Francis's in the hands of his Bishop.</p> 
               <p>"How comes on our cause otherwise? St. Louis was wont to be wholly Catholic-and I am grieved that schisms have arisen in her borders!"</p> 
               <p>"We have been too lax in our discipline," returned the Arch-Bishop, "there, as elswhere. His Holiness now sees the need of more energetic measures, and has given his servants here authority to see them enforced. He has, also, by establishing the Inquisition very near us, put a stop to renegades from the Priesthood, which will greatly advance our cause. Its walls now hide from the heretics the mysteries of our Faith, which her false Priests would betray to them. As Father Francis has perished, so will perish all who, forgetting the interest of the whole for the benefit<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5770-00000066"/> of a few miserable creatures, break their oaths and thus forfeit their lives."</p> 
               <p>"Through the negligence of the Priesthood, heresy has taken root and grown until it has become a monster. I am informed that, only a few days since, when a host was being borne through the street, the people hooted at it, and when some of the faithful chastised them for it, they were dragged before the secular powers who imprisoned them for protecting Christ from insult. This ought not to be so. The heretics have became audacious, and we must look better to the Pope's interest here, or were His Holiness himself to come among them, as one day he undoubtedly will, they would hoot at him instead of hide their faces in the dust before him!"</p> 
               <p>"How is our cause in New Orleans? I hope we have more cheering news from that city."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-brethren, that is the Garden of the Church in America, and is the only spot favored by proximity to the Inquisition-that purifier and preserver of our Faith. While she deserves to be thus blessed, she will remain the beloved of His Holiness."</p> 
               <p>"Baltimore-what news have we from that place?"</p> 
               <p>"Alas! she too has had discord sown in her midst, and must be purified by the sword. From being the centre of our Church along the coast, she has become a nest of vipers which sting and vex the faithful."</p> 
               <p>Then turning to the Bishop of Baltimore he addressed him<pb n=""/> "My brother has been over lenient to his charge! Let this now cease forever, that this spot may bear a better report in future."</p> 
               <p>The reproved Bishop bowed submissively before his Superior. Had he done aught to merit reproof?-he thought not; and then came thoughts of the Eeclesiastical <unclear>Court,</unclear> with all the horrors of the attending Inquisition. He attempted to shake from his heart these vague, undefined feelings of dread which had taken possession of his soul; but still he fancied the eye of the Arch-Bishop was bent coldly, suspiciously upon him, and with the ominous reproof sounding in his ears, he could not dispel the pallor from his lips, or the look of terror from his eyes.</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop saw with secret satisfaction the alarm of the Bishop. It augured well for his influence over the Bishops, which was essential to the furthering of his ambitious schemes. There had been those who had denied his right of dictation in the common affairs of life, and it was absolutely necessary that this idea should be rooted out. His reproof had been administered more for effect than because there were grounds for it. Our ambition is the same the world over-it resolves into the one idea of subjecting our fellow men to obey our behests.</p> 
               <p>"In Philadelphia, alas!" continued the Arch-Bishop, after a short pause, "I hear of schisms and contumacy among the faithful, who have become imbued with heresies, sown among them by heretics, whom they have allowed<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5770-00000067"/> to mingle in daily life among them. Our brothers have sought to eradicate these evils, and by gentleness win them back to submission and obedience, to which they have turned a deaf ear; it remains now for us to use sterner measures to reclaim them, which must be done without delay. One of our Confessors in that city has shown himself a faithful servant of the Church, and one well calculated to advance the interests of the Churches in that place during the sojourn of her Bishop in Europe."</p> 
               <p>The Confessor received the approbation of his Superior with protestations that he scarcely deserved it; that, in all he had done he had acted conscientiously for the benefit and advancement of the Church, and concluded with begging his Superior to guide him with his wisdom and counsels how to proceed in the future. All this time the victims whom he had dragged down to a living death were writhing with the keenest torture. Oh, human heart! of what hypocrisy art thou not capable?</p> 
               <p>"Purge your charge, my brother-purge it without stint, and my word for it, the stray sheep will return with prayers for forgiveness," returned the Arch-Bishop. "There may be some who will remain obdurate, and on these impose the penalties that our Order provides for them. But come what will, heed not their remonstrances; work silently, but surely. The Church will extend her protection to you in whatever you do for her glory."</p> 
               <p>"I hear," observed one of the Bishops, "that a strong<pb n=""/> anti-Catholic party is in contemplation, led on by renegade Catholics! Can you tell me, my Lord, if this is correct?"</p> 
               <p>"Alas! it is too true! I have, however, matured plans for the removal of these renegades, every one of whom is known to me, and they will not much longer vex us!"</p> 
               <p>"I fear their removal will only serve to irritate the citizens, while they need soothing, or there will, ere long, be outbreaks among them, which can do us no good, and may do us much harm," remonstrated the Bishop of Baltimore.</p> 
               <p>"Not so," returned the Arch-Bishop peremptorily, "we must use more rigor-we have already held the masses by so lax a rein, that they begin to look upon themselves as our equals. They must be taught their true position. Our Church's vitality depends upon this, as also does the throne of His Holiness. The Chair of St. Peter must soon be removed to America, and it is our duty to pave the way and prepare the people for so great an event. And, the first step to this is, to teach the people due deference to their Superiors. I am rejoiced that, in the absence of the Bishop of Philadelphia, we have one so sternly true to us as the Confessor now with us, to fill his place. To him we may safely trust the mandates of His Holiness, with the assurance of seeing them executed to the very letter. More such servants as this is what we want-what we <emph>must have.</emph> Too many of us-and I allude to it<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5770-00000068"/> with sorrow-allow minor considerations to divert our minds from our one great object. This should not be. Every tie, however dear, if it stands in our path, must be subdued; every principle that conflicts with our progress, must be trampled in the dust. We shall meet with opposition, but we must fortify ourselves to meet it. A stern, unyielding hostility to our enemies will overcome them, and we shall be rewarded by seeing the secular power in the hands of our Order; then our faith will be made a National Faith, and the heretics will be hunted by the strong arm of the law from out the Union. When this day arrives, the Chair of St. Peter will be reared in our midst, around which will cluster the inexhaustible wealth of the land. Then there will be no more poor among the Priesthood of the Church, for there will be treasure enough for all."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, my Lord," returned the Confessor. "In that day we will teach the masses lessons of obedience and charity that will be of service to our Church, and bring them to a sense of their duty. Under the Heretics' rule, the lower classes live and dress as well as their masters. This is all wrong. The money expended thus ought to be paid into the general treasury, for the building of Churches and Nunneries, supporting the Catholic Government and Priesthood. One-third the sum annually expended by the working classes, is sufficient for all necessary purposes for their support. The rest, by right, ought<pb n=""/> yearly to be poured into our treasury; and will be when we get the reins of government into our own hands, and impose and collect the tithes and taxes."</p> 
               <p>"Before all these reforms can be accomplished," said a Priest of St. Philip de Neri, "we shall need arms and ammunition; and I would submit to your judgment the propriety of having Military Companies formed exclusively of members of our Order, duly recognized and chartered by the State. These will be in our interest, and should outbreaks occur, will be disciplined and equiped to defend us. Also, I would recommend the propriety of converting our Churches into arsenals for the collection of arms and ammunition, so that if necessity requires it, we can at a moment's warning distribute them among our people. Defenders of our faith will never be wanting; but the implements of defence may, if we neglect this precaution."</p> 
               <p>"I have thought much of this myself," returned the Arch-Bishop, "and should have laid my plans before you, had you not mentioned the subject. We may, it is true, need arms and ammunition-men we have. In procuring these we must be cautious, so as not to alarm the existing authorities. It would be well to engage some of the members of our Order who are gun-smiths to procure these things for us, and have them conveyed to their destination by night, so as to avert suspicion. Once within the portals of the Churches, they can be effectually concealed in<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5770-00000069"/> the secret vaults beneath them, where no search can find them, except by those in the secret. It has also for months been a favorite idea with me to organize Catholic brigades, which can be accomplished, with care, without exciting a ray of suspicion that they are for any other than their ostensible purpose. These must be organized on the plan of old Military Companies, differing in no wise but in the exclusion of all persons not of our Order. There are Military Companies already in existence which, with a little judicious remodeling will, with alacrity respond to our wishes. The Captain of one of these I saw last week, and am informed by him that two-thirds of his Company are already in our interest as members of St. Leopold, and that the others who cannot be won over he can find cause for expelling, and of substituting others more tractable. With your concurrence I will see this arrangement immediately carried into effect."</p> 
               <p>"Would it not be well also," said the Confessor, "to have those who are able of the laity procure rifles and ammunition? This can be done without exciting suspicion, and would be of service should they ever be needed!"</p> 
               <p>"Which Heaven grant may never occur," said a venerable old man, who had hitherto remained silent. "It seems to me." he continued, "we are all wrong as to the manner of procuring the reforms we wish to accomplish. These should be brought about by humble men, staff and crozier in hand, who will win men's hearts by their singleness of<pb n=""/> purpose and holy lives. St. Peter gave us the earth for a dominion, and it will yet be all ours. Let us not, then, imbue our hands in blood to accomplish what will with more silent and surer means fall inevitably in our hands."</p> 
               <p>"Such a theory will do for you," cried the Arch-Bishop, passionately, "for you stand already on the confines of eternity, and must pass away before aught can be accomplished. But for me, never. I am still in the prime of manhood. I have devoted the best part of my life in this pursuit, resisting every obstacle, with an iron will, that could draw me from my purpose. For this I have trampled on every natural affection of my being; on every impulse of my heart. For this I have held myself aloof from my fellow man, that in the silence of the cloister, I might mature plans that would wrest away the hereties' government and establish our own in its stead. Stratagem alone, I am convinced, will fail to accomplish our purpose; but <emph>that</emph> with the Catholics in arms, must prevail. Shall I then hesitate when every step brings me nearer the goal? Shall I, because the blood of heretics may strew my path, give over this land, laden with treasures, to their rule? Out upon such cowardice, such treachery to our Faith, our Order, and even to God himself-for, in relinquishing our object we commit treason against the throne of God, who is represented on earth by the Pope! It is <emph>His</emph> throne we have sworn to set up in our midst, and death to the traitor who falters in his purpose." (See Note 37.)</p> 
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5770-00000070"/> 
               <p>The members quailed beneath the fierce flashing eye of their Superior who, with dilated form and frowning brow, uttered these words. The old man who had called them forth remained unmoved, his hands palsied with age, crossed meekly on his breast, where hung an ivory cross which he clasped tenderly to his withered, slow beating heart. Not a pulse started quicker in his old veins, as the burning words rolled from the Arch-Bishop's lips in fierce tones; but when he sat down the old man rose slowly, and gazing long and earnestly over the assembly, said in a gentle but firm voice-</p> 
               <p>"Before the rest of my brethren here assembled, saw the light, I was laboring in the harvest field of my Master; and when your first wail sounded on your mother's ear, my Lord, I had spent a score of years in teaching the mysteries of our Faith to souls in darkness. In all these years I have learned that men cannot be driven to adopt any faith; but they may be led, if you hide the halter with which you lead them. Think you I have spent a long life in laboring for the conversion of others to our Faith, and not learned to love our cause, and wish to see it finally triumphant over all its foes? But in these years, I have learned wisdom also; and, therefore, have listened to sentiments which, if carried out, will create a feeling of distrust of us, and be the means of crippling our efforts in years to come. If we would have success eventually crown our efforts, we must not shed one drop of blood,<pb n=""/> or lay our hands on any man's life. We must labor silently; be humble, prayerful, and, before two centuries the glorious prize will fall into our hands, which, unstained by crime, will be outstretched to receive the glorious reward for her virtues and patience."</p> 
               <p>"Will you and I, and the rest of us, be here to reap the reward?" returned the Arch-Bishop, impatiently. "Our fathers, and our fathers' fathers before them, waited; but I will wait no longer! Why should we wait to let the reward fall into others' hands? Ours it shall be to deserve and receive it. Two centuries hence may do for others, but not for us!"</p> 
               <p>"Then, let me warn you, my Lord that, by the course you propose to adopt, you will not accomplish your object, except at a cost which will outweigh its value. The heretics have arms and hearts of iron, and will fight for their Faith as long as a handful remains of them."</p> 
               <p>"If, then, none remains after the contest is ended, so much the better for us! Their houses and lands, with all their accumulated wealth, will then be wholly ours, while we can fill their places with Catholics from the old world, who are accustomed to Masters, and will not expect to be treated as equals."</p> 
               <p>The old man muttered a prayer, crossed his brow, and was silent. Did he then foresee the termination of the Arch-Bishop's criminal career, or was he praying to be spared the sight of brother plunging the naked steel into<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5770-00000071"/> the bosom of his brother, because they differed in their religious faith?</p> 
               <p>"Think not," continued the Arch-Bishop, after a few minutes' silence, "that I take the responsibility of my course-that alone belongs to Christ's Vicar on Earth, and by His commands, which not one of us dare disobey, I shape my course. At our organization I laid before you his directions, with the discretionary power he conferred on me. Since then, I have received orders to prosecute with still greater rigor these reforms. The political air is heavy with gathering tempests in the old world, and they will grind the Chair of St. Peter into powder, if it is not before then, removed out of their reach. Here is the only place of safety for it, and here it must be reared. Are we not criminal by vacillating? I think so; and shall press these reforms to my utmost ability. In several States of the Union, we have men pledged to have the Heretic Bible wholly withdrawn from the Schools by the Legislature, or a separate School Fund instituted for our children. The Press will soon receive some checks by several libel suits which will be instituted, which will cause it to be more wary in speaking of us, or what is better, maintain a silence on the subject altogether. Street declamations will within the year, in most, if not all of the States, become an indictable offence. Such has been our progress so far, and if we are faithful to the oath that binds us together, we shall soon be victors."</p>

               <pb n=""/> 
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>Adjournment of the Convention-The object for which the Arch-Bishop had called it-His inordinate ambition, and resolution to obtain the Tiara-His secret desire to become a Cardinal-He is alone cogitating over his plans-He is interrupted by the entrance of Enna-Interesting filial exhibitions of affection-Singular acknowledgments-He dismisses her and is again alone-His schemes ripen, and his success appears on the increase-Approaching events, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>The members of the Council had dispersed and the Arch-Bishop was alone with his own thoughts, dark, intriguing, criminal, but from which he never turned aside, never faltered in their execution. The Council was a body of his own creation-its members men of his own selection. Some, it is true, he had called hither, not that he desired them, but that their presence might give his decisions weight with those who dared to scrutinize his actions. These were men who had labored successfully in the service of their Divine Master for more than half a century, their only reward the blessings which followed their footsteps from the lanes and alleys where they had taught lips hitherto strangers to such sounds, to sing in adoration to their Creator. They were humble and lowly, like the Apostles of old, but rich in wisdom, charity, faith and the hope which, with its white pinions, bears the contrite spirit<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5770-00000072"/> up to the bosom of its God. Their names were synonomous with piety, virtue, and devotion; their lives the beacons for those who professed to follow in their footsteps. Had Catholicism from the beginning of her career had enough such men, she would never have been drunk with the blood of her slaughtered people; her dungeons had never echoed to the groans of those who refused to deny their God; and Christianity with spotless wings would, now like a seraph, hover over the world, shedding her light and life into the heart of every son and daughter of earth.</p> 
               <p>There was no compunction in his heart to disturb him for the course he was pursuing, no love for the land that had extended a hand of welcome and protection to him, which, with base ingratitude, he was now secretly planning to seduce from her allegiance, and even preparing to impose the mandates of a foreign Potentate upon her freeborn sons by force of arms, if he otherwise failed. With a silent ambition trampling upon every sentiment of honor, and an indomitable will which pressed through every obstacle, as if so many reeds had stood in his path, even his followers in the foul conspiracy would have paused, had they known it was to gratify his ambition more than the welfare of the Church that was hurrying him on in his course; but they were blinded by duplicity which he knew so well how to impose upon others with consummate skill.</p> 
               <p>The action of the Council dictated by himself, had given<pb n=""/> the course he intended to pursue an air of mature deliberation, and he was buoyant with hope of a speedy consummation of plans which would embroil the Protestant and Catholic community in active hostility to each other; and give rise to the necessity of a resident leader for the Catholics, who should be vested with authority secondary only to the Pope.</p> 
               <p>"Who so capable as I?" he said, "to fill the station-aye, is there another possessing the faculty of guiding the turbulent Catholic spirit? What other man in the whole Church can at the voice of command, raise them to a pitch of phrensy, and thus hold them harmless, obedient and equally ready to return calmly to their homes, or drench the streets with heretics' blood? They already in their hearts, acknowledge me as their Master, and their Master I will be!"</p> 
               <p>A merry laughing voice, free and joyous, broke the stillness, and reverberated along the lofty corridors. He recognized those childish tones which ever fell on his heart like balm, cooling and soothing the lava tide of ambition that rolled over his soul, searing every other gentle aspiration of his heart. As the voice drew nearer, the stern, rigid features of the Arch-Bishop relaxed, the haughty demeanor disappeared, and as the door opened, and gently but confidently, as if sure of a welcome, Enna approached him; the old flash of unperverted nobleness of nature with which he was, in years before, accustomed to greet the<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5770-00000073"/> child's mother, hovered around his brow, illumined his quick, searching eye, as if ready to linger there if the soul within bade it stay, and sit upon its usurped throne. He opened his arms and the child sprang forward and was folded to his heart, her golden tresses falling over his arm as he held her there, with her young head resting upon <emph>his</emph> heart, which was overflowing with the seething lava of discord, he was already scattering with no stinting hand over the land.</p> 
               <p>For a moment he forgot all his strife for power and lived over again the hours of early bliss.</p> 
               <p>"Mine, mine," he murmured as he pressed his lips to her upturned brow, "my beautiful, my daughter!"</p> 
               <p>"Say that again!-I have so longed for some one to hold me thus and call me daughter."</p> 
               <p>"Does, then, your little heart yearn for a parent's love? Enna, my Enna, if you could keep a secret which, if revealed would be my ruin, I could tell you of a parent's heart that, at times yearns for a daughter's love; yearns to assure her she is his daughter, and the love she gives him is the instinct of nature."</p> 
               <p>"My parents?-no, it cannot be; for they have long been dead! Ah! would that I could remember them. Sometimes I think I do, for often when lying on my cot a beautiful woman seems hovering around me, looking so lovingly upon me that I start up and call her mother, when, lo! she vanishes!"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"What is she like, my Enna? Saw you ever human being like her?"</p> 
               <p>"Never-she is like nothing earthly! Even the Madonna has not beauty like hers!"</p> 
               <p>"It must be she!"</p> 
               <p>"I can hardly tell," murmured the child. "Ah! there she is; look! she is by your side, and now lays her hand on your shoulder, as she smiles down upon us. Mother! mother! there, she is gone! It is ever thus; when I speak, she leaves me!" And the child, who had started up eagerly, as she cried, "Mother, mother!" sank sobbing back in the Arch-Bishop's arms who, with pale, quivering lips, soothed her with gentle words. Then, drawing a small portrait from beneath his vest, he held it before her.</p> 
               <p>"It is she! mother! mother!" cried the child, seizing the portrait, and gazing long and eagerly on the beautiful features pictured there.</p> 
               <p>"The likeness is wonderful," murmured the Arch-Bishop. "The same golden waving hair, deep, fathomless blue eyes, coral lips, disclosing the small pearly teeth, and pure transparent complexion. Isabel, my own Isabel, again lives in her child?"</p> 
               <p>"You will give me this portrait; it is my mother's, who comes so often to visit me, and who even now stood before us."</p> 
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5770-00000074"/> 
               <p>"You are sure, you saw this woman? Could you not be mistaken?"</p> 
               <p>"Mistaken-did you not see her yourself, and feel her hand on your shoulder?"</p> 
               <p>"Alas, no! She never comes to me; would that she did. Her lovliness and purity is no longer for me; but I thank God that she watches over you, for her presence would sanctify a fallen angel."</p> 
               <p>"She is my mamma; will you not assure me she is?" asked the child, eagerly.</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop paused irresolute. Should he tell her all? No, no, he could not; and to unfold half the truth, would jeopard his own prospects for the future; for Enna was but a child who could not realize the value of a sentence which might in a moment of forgetfulness dash his ambitious schemes to the ground. If he did tell her, it could do her no real good, and might cause her grief for what could never be recalled-unavailing grief for what was past.</p> 
               <p>"This is your guardian angel, Enna," he said slowly at last, "one who watches over you nightly, as I do daily. I can tell you no more now, my child, and can not even part from this portrait, which I have carried so long that I have learned to value it."</p> 
               <p>The child's soft flexible features assumed a troubled and anxious look, as her fingers closed tightly around the portrait.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"This is my mother! What was she to you, that you wear her portrait?" demanded the child with something of his own haughty spirit, as she drew still closer to her the prize.</p> 
               <p>"What was Isabel to me? my own Isabel? Oh God! what was she? That you may not know! Isabel! Isabel! my peerless, my bride!"</p> 
               <p>"Was she your bride, and I her child?" demanded Enna, gently, firmly, but with an energy of purpose he had never seen her before display.</p> 
               <p>"Tell all my brother," said the sweet, calm voice of Sister Geneve, who had witnessed the struggle going on in his heart between nature and ambition, "See you not," she continued, "the earnest thought of dawning womanhood on her brow? Unfold to her all, and trust her. You will both be happier for it in the future!"</p> 
               <p>"Ah! Lillian!-happiness for me has long been an unmeaning sound. That terrible night of more than mortal agony when we stood by the side of my dead Isabel, left but one passion alive in my heart! Every other since then has been merged into this, which I must pursue eagerly and without remission, for with remission comes thought which sets my brain on fire."</p> 
               <p>"Think you, my brother, I have not also suffered? Look on me, and tell me if it is not better that she be trusted, than that she spend a <unclear>life</unclear> like mine?"</p> 
               <p>"Lillian! Oh, Lillian! rather would I release her pure<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5770-00000075"/> spirit from its beautiful clay than that she should suffer as you have done."</p> 
               <p>"How many years is it since I was fair, innocent and pure as she? Who then would have prophesied such a future for me?"</p> 
               <p>"No one, Lillian! But she shall not be placed within the reach of temptation."</p> 
               <p>"Still, I had avowed protectors-and if with these I became what I am, how shall she escape if the same course be pursued towards her, without avowed paternal protection? The day is not far distant when her heart will pine for some near and dear object on which it may lean in security; better let her know the truth, and the past may warn, while it places her in a natural position in our hearts."</p> 
               <p>"Even then, we could not love her more. No, no, Lillian, I can not do this. You know not-never can know, all that urges me on to this determination. Still it must be final. But wo to the tongue that first pollutes her ears; the eye that casts an unholy look on her. The darkest dungeon and heaviest torture shall blot out that word or look!"</p> 
               <p>"What if it comes from a source you have not the power to punish? I had still been pure, had such not have led my childish feet astray."</p> 
               <p>"As there is a God in Heaven, Lillian, were it the Pope himself, I would find a way to punish him! I am not powerless, Lillian. Two millions of Catholics in this Union<pb n=""/> hang upon my commands, and call me Master! Can you not guess the meaning of all the preparation that has been so actively going on for months past?"</p> 
               <p>"The Holy Virgin grant that it is the purification of our Faith from the sin and sorrow that, for ages, have been gathering around it!" returned Lillian devotedly.</p> 
               <p>"Say, rather, to purify the land, and redeem it from heretical rule. No, no, Lillian! I will never pause in my pursuit-never swerve from the path I have marked out, until I have reached the acme of my ambition-<emph>The Chair of St. Peter.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Brother, this is sacrilege!"</p> 
               <p>"Lillian! I know what I say, and know that I have much to accomplish before I can succeed. Still I will succeed, and my chances of success are not few or weak. The Pope is old and imbecile, and cannot live much longer; and I mistake the signs of the times if Italy ever suffers another Pope to be crowned in her domains. European Catholic States are rotten and crumbling, but America is young and strong, and to her shores, on her soil, must we look for the perpetuity of the Popedom. Here, I am the first and most trusted of her servants. Already Gregory has offered me a Cardinal's hat and seal which, ere long I hope to claim. Once a Cardinal, are not my prospects good for being the first American Pope?" (See Note 38.)</p> 
               <p>"Will the Protestants allow a Pope to reign among<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5770-00000076"/> them? Will it not lead to contention, and even intestine war?"</p> 
               <p>"So much the better, if it does; then, under the pretence of defending ourselves we can cut down the heretics wherever we find them. Should it not, we will try a St. Bartholomew massacre in the cities, which will awe the rural districts sufficient to make them harmless." (See Note 39.)</p> 
               <p>"Oh! brother, brother!"-cried Lillian, "would you then steep in blood, crime and chains, this free, happy people, at whose hands we have received kindness, hospitality and protection when they have elsewhere been denied us? Will you give treachery and baseness for sheltering and fostering our faith until it has grown strong enough to strike back the generous heart that has warmed it into life?"</p> 
               <p>"It is no ingratitude to turn against heretics, Lillian. They owed us the wealth they accumulated, and their strong arms to labor for and protect us. We are, by Divine right, their masters, and has not a master a right to his slaves?" (See Note 40.)</p> 
               <p>"They are not slaves. Although they are heretics, they are freemen!"</p> 
               <p>"So they call themselves. But they are vassals of the Pope. America was first discovered by a Catholic; and the discoverer took possession of it in the name of a subject of the Pope. Consequently the continent belonged, by<pb n=""/> right of discovery to the Pope, who has never resigned that right or made it over to another. Even as late as 1765 this right was not disputed. He has neglected this part of his domain until the people have grown arrogant and presumptuous. Now the time has arrived to check this monstrous thing they call <emph>Liberty,</emph> and lead back the people to the feet of their Master." (See Note 41.)</p> 
               <p>The shade of sadness deepened on Lillian's brow, as she slowly led Enna from the room, who had nestled frightened to her side, when she heard the words of passion fall from the Arch-Bishop's lips.</p> 
               <p>"Why does his Grace call you Lillian, Sister Geneve?" said Enna, as they proceeded to their own room.</p> 
               <p>"That was my name before I entered a Convent and took the veil. I am his sister, and he still loves to call me by the name he did in childhood. Happy, innocent childhood was ours! Alas! we knew not the dark future before us."</p>

               <argument> 
                  <p>Winter disappearing and the approach of Spring-Priestly severity-Its progress-Young Shiffler, Paul and Mr. Connelly-Shiffler's excitement-Paul's questions in regard to the safety of Irene-Incipient steps towards the formation of an American Party-American Demonstration-An immense gathering of freemen at the Odd Fellows' Hall-They adjourn to the Old Meeting House-Declaration of Principles-Mr. Steinmitz and his accusers-The Bible in the Schools-Miss Bedford and the Jesuit Director-Her noble conduct-John Painter and Wm. D. Baker Speakers-Catholic Dissatisfaction.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>THE rigor of winter was fast giving away to Spring. But in those months had emerged in the might of truth and right from its chrysalis where it had lain dormant, but not the less imbued with vitality, over two centuries, <emph>the spirit of old</emph> that caused our forefathers to fly from the land of their birth, forsaking home, friends, kindred and all the heart holds dear, that this latent fire kindled in their hearts by the hand of God, might shed its light around, undisturbed by the tyrant hand upraised to crush even their feeble breath, should interest or fancy dictate such a blow. What had called this slumbering spirit into vitality after long ages of repose? Ah! it was the cry of distress, of oppression-and, lo! the spirit became embodied in a form; and that form was hailed with shouts of welcome, of hope and gladness, and as it floated<pb n=""/> along, its proud head erect, and its eagle eye on the sun the air was rent with the peals of thankfulness that it had arisen, that "<emph>Liberty,</emph>" with her never-ceasing youth and beauty, was among them, scattering her precepts of love, mercy, good will to every son and daughter of Earth-forbearance and tolerance to whatever name and creed.</p> 
               <p>"Come, Paul, and Mr. Connelly, I have called to take you with me to-night," said young Shiffler, entering Mr. Connelly's house unexpectedly, early in the evening of the 26th of February, 1844.</p> 
               <p>"You look animated and excited: have you any clue of <emph>her?</emph>" cried Paul, the care-worn expression that had been daily deepening since it first rested there, vanishing momentarily as a ray of hope shot through his breast.</p> 
               <p>"Alas, no! But I tell you, Paul, the many unprovoked acts of aggression which, with unparalleled audacity have been perpetrated, have at last aroused us to defence. We can bear no more, and we are weekly perfecting measures which will effectually check them."</p> 
               <p>"You know not the extent and power of the Church, if you entertain the idea that human means can thwart her in the attainment of any object," remarked Mr. Connelly. Then, he added, "I have my fears that the American liberties are being steadily but surely undermined, and the pit, that will forever engulph her free limbs, is already yawning beneath."</p> 
               <p>"No, no!" cried Shiffler, "know you not, she has<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5770-00000078"/> arisen in her might? Come, come with me, and behold her in all her freeborn, triumphant purity and loveliness."</p> 
               <p>"You rave, Shiffler," said Paul, sadly. "If there is freedom among us, how is it that treachery and crime go unpunished? How is it that we are mocked and pursued with: unrelenting cruelty; our only offence daring to think for ourselves? You have heard of Steinmitz? Yesterday he was arrested for larceny, and thrown into prison by his employer!"</p> 
               <p>"What! the Steinmitz that the Confessor persecuted so last fall?"</p> 
               <p>"The same. He finally obtained good employment with an excellent man, at fair wages, for whom he has labored steadily, until arrested. It seems that, various articles have been missed, from time to time, for a number of weeks past, but no suspicion rested on Steinmitz, until yesterday morning, when his employer received an anonymous letter, stating that, if Steinmitz's premises were searched the missing articles would be found. More out of curiosity than with the hope of success, the search was instituted when, to their surprise and sorrow, they were all found, amounting to about twenty dollars' worth of stolen property. Steinmitz's employer was indignant, and proceeded to extreme measures without delay. Those, however, who know Steinmitz, and know his family as well as I do, think him as guiltless as we are, and do not<pb n=""/> hesitate to say the whole scheme was concocted and carried out by his persecutors."</p> 
               <p>"This, Paul, is one reason more why you should attend the meeting to-night, and judge between us. You are a Catholic, but not a bigoted one. Nevertheless, you may hear things unpalatable; still I feel anxious you should go."</p> 
               <p>"You speak of this new party-REPUBLICANS, I believe they call themselves?"</p> 
               <p>"And you may rest assured they are what they call themselves. But it was a mass meeting I spoke of to be held at the Odd-Fellows' Hall, and will be made up of the people without distinction of party. The Republicans will, however, be there in full force. You have seen their platform I presume?"</p> 
               <p>"No," said Mr. Connelly, "I have only heard of it."</p> 
               <p>"You are behind me then, for since <emph>that night</emph>"-and a wild, haggard expression gleamed from his face as he alluded to it-"I have thought of nothing else, cared for nothing else but to devise plans for checkmating intolerance. But here is a copy of the principles of this new party which has now been scarcely three months in existence; yet it has already become powerful, and boasts of talent equal to any in the land"-continued Shiffler reading from a paper he held in his hand-</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Firstly-We are in favor of twenty-one years naturalization laws.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Secondly-That none but Native born American citizens<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5770-00000079"/> zens shall hold any office of trust or profit in these United States.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Thirdly-That we advocate an equal distribution of the School Funds, and no sectarian influence in our Public Schools."</p> 
               <p>"If these are your principles, then I am a Republican," said Mr. Connelly with animation.</p> 
               <p>"And I also," exclaimed Paul. "But how is this; I supposed it a secret society, and here you have been revealing its principles to those who are not members?"</p> 
               <p>"Quite the contrary. We court investigation and disdain concealment. Have you not seen the call to all citizens of whatever party or faith to attend their deliberations? But come-the meeting will be organized and we shall miss the proceedings if we do not haste away."</p> 
               <p>When they reached the Hall, it was crowded already to overflowing, while several hundred citizens stood packed around the doors and windows, eager to catch every word that passed within.</p> 
               <p>"We are too late! We cannot enter; neither can we hear from this place!"</p> 
               <p>At that moment a clear, clarion-like voice arose above the hum of the multitude-"The citizens will repair to the Old Brick Meeting House, to which place the meeting is adjourned, where all can be accommodated."</p> 
               <p>"Now is the time. We can reach it, and get seats before half of this crowd can get out of the Hall," and<pb n=""/> away they started, followed closely by the eager citizens. Ere they passed half the distance, they encountered the two sons of Steinmitz.</p> 
               <p>"How fares it with your father, to-night?" asked Mr. Connelly, as he exchanged greetings with them.</p> 
               <p>"Well, but much depressed; and declares he would as soon be in prison as out, with this dreadful charge hanging over him."</p> 
               <p>"He is free then?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he was bailed out a few hours ago; but, when a man loses his character for honesty, he might as well die, be he ever so innocent of the crime charged against him."</p> 
               <p>"Still, he is not looked upon or believed to be guilty."</p> 
               <p>"Believed! Sir," cried Ellis, passionately, "think you it possible that one of our family <emph>would steal!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"No, no, my noble boy. An enemy has him now in his toils; but the truth must at last triumph!"</p> 
               <p>"Has it triumphed and restored to us Irene?" said Paul moodily.</p> 
               <p>A tremor shook the slight frame of Shiffler, at the sound of that loved name, so fraught with agony, and he turned away as he said-</p> 
               <p>"Return to your home, boys, and persuade your father to accompany you to the Old Brick Meeting House, where you will hear something that will open your eyes, and do your hearts good-come," he continued moving away, "or we shall be too late to gain entrance there."</p> 
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5770-00000080"/> 
               <p>The house was full when they arrived, but by exertion, they made their way to the front of the speaker's stand. Still the citizens crowded in until they formed one dense mass of upturned eager faces, and in the speaker that arose to address them, they recognized a well known citizen-JOHN PAINTER. (See Note 42.)</p> 
               <p>"Gentlemen," said he, "I feel that I am performing a duty-a solemn duty-and when rights and principles are invaded-rights and principles which we most cherish and ever strive to maintain, what American citizen would fear to raise his voice in defence of them? Having heard that Miss Louisa Bedford, has been requested to discontinue the use of the Bible in the School of which she is a teacher, I called on her to learn by whose authority the direction had been given. While in conversation with her, a Director came into the room,"-here eager wrathful shouts of "Name him! name him!"-interrupted the speaker, who hesitated to comply, when they were redoubled, blended with imperative cries of "Let us know who is for robbing us of our Bibles!" "Since you will have his name, Mr. Clark, is the director referred to." "Mr. Clark," continued the speaker, "on being accosted on the subject, said he would assume the responsibility of taking the Bible from the Schools; and turning to Miss Bedford, told her not to read the Bible again to her scholars." Here a murmur of indignation ran through the room, and the speaker continued-"Miss<pb n=""/> Bedford with a gentle firmness replied, 'I have always read the Bible in the School, and would rather give up my situation as Teacher, than discontinue the reading of it now.'"</p> 
               <p>A loud shout of applause greeted the reply of the noble girl, mingled by a heavy sob-and turning in the direction whence it came, they saw the stalwart frame of Steinmitz convulsed, with his face buried in his hands, while on either side stood Ellis and Charles, their eyes alternately suffused by emotion and flashing with indignation.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Clark said that, the Bible had been withdrawn from other Schools, and he should take good care that it remained no longer in this one. Gentlemen," continued the speaker, "where is the American citizen who will submit to this? Have we not arrived at a nice state of affairs, when the Pope of Rome shall say to Protestant American citizens in their own country, 'You shall not have the Bible in your Schools?' Rather let us meet this matter at once, and do not let us be put down or frightened by these minions of the Pope!" The speaker sat down while the audience were tossed by contending emotions, far above which arose the shouts of applause, prolonged until the building trembled to its foundation. Order being restored, WM. D. BAKER arose-"Papal Rome," said he, "has dared to perpetrate an outrage on Republican America, which will startle us in our fancied security of civil and religious liberty! I see your eyes sparkling and your<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5770-00000081"/> cheeks flushing with conscious shame, to think, we have so long submitted tamely to the dictation of the Church of Rome! We had the Bible read in the Schools of my District until Rome decided we should have it no longer-that the sons and daughters of freemen-native born citizens, and those who are the adopted children of the Republic, should be deprived of the influence of that best of books, because the Pope had sent forth his mandate-and we of necessity must submit! But we should be less than men did we not resist this secret and dangerous power, while yet our hands are free from chains and our mouths are not closed. There was a time when I would not speak on this subject; that time, thank God, has gone by! When I behold an attempt made, in some instances successfully too, to deprive us of a right we have enjoyed since the founding of Pennsylvania; the privilege to worship in what manner we thought most proper to secure our eternal welfare: I can no longer hesitate. As well might they attempt to stop us from entering our sacred Temples, erected to the worship of the living God, as to tear from the hands of our children the Holy Bible!"</p> 
               <p>The vast multitude swayed with indignation at the indignities heaped upon them by those they had taken in their wretched state of servitude and raised to an equality with themselves, and treated as brothers, murmured low of retribution; but the closed compresssed lips, flashing<pb n=""/> ing eyes and dilated features were far more intelligible than words.</p> 
               <p>"Look," continued Mr. Baker, "at the Papists of New York! With unblushing effrontery, they asked that the Bible might be excluded from the Public Schools, and the corrupt law-makers yielded a willing acquiescence to the modest request! But here I am proud to find the tide of desolation which is sweeping over the land will become stayed; that the people of Kensington will resist its force with all their might and strength, for if it be not stayed here, where will it stop?" Here, amidst applause that attested how heartily his sentiments were seconded by those present, he sat down. Others addressed them, among whom was the Rev. Mr. Guistiniani, who had been a priest of Rome for twenty years. He enlightened them on the intrigues employed against them, and asserted that the half had not yet come to light, so secret and silent were they wont to carry on their plans. "In Rome," said he, "I would not be allowed to speak thus. I should be dragged down and torn to pieces. As long as you have the Bible the Pope can have no power over you, for its light drives him back to his own domains."</p> 
               <p>Several resolutions were here brought before the citizens assembled, and carried with perfect unanimity, and feeling strong that they were now supported in their course by so many of their brothers, they went forth prepared to<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5770-00000082"/> stand firm and unyielding in the protection of their birthright of free action and free thought.</p> 
               <p>"What do you think of us now?" said young Shiffler, when they had gained the open air.</p> 
               <p>"I feel that your course is right. I acknowledge with sorrow that our Church has been pursuing a war of unwarrantable aggression upon our institutions."</p> 
               <p>"I know they are right," said Paul, "and hope they may succeed in checking intolerance; for it is that monster in the garb of peace, that has spirited away our Irene!"</p> 
               <p>"Paul!"-said Shiffler, in a quick, husky voice, "when you pass that Church, what thought is uppermost in your heart?"</p> 
               <p>"That, could the walls speak, they could tell us of the lost one! Why did you ask?"</p> 
               <p>"I hardly know, except for weeks past I have nightly wandered around it; and Paul do not think I would do it-or any thing so wicked; but I can hardly keep myself from setting fire to its hated walls!"</p> 
               <p>"George!" cried Paul, in alarm, as he looked long and searchingly in his face, while his own blanched with a thrill of fear and dread.</p> 
               <p>"Don't be frightened, Paul, I am not mad," returned Shiffler, as a cold unmeaning smile wreathed his lips.</p> 
               <p>At that moment the crowd pressed them on, and encountering Steinmitz, Mr. Connelly said-</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"How fares it with you now?-can you sanction all you have heard to-night?"</p> 
               <p>"Had I suffered less, I could not." Then he added sadly, "God in his mercy save his Holy Church, or those who have been placed on her walls to guard her will lead her to destruction."</p> 
               <p>"Even so," said Mr. Connelly, "but the time is coming when their insane ambition to dictate to their protectors will have an end, and then our Holy Church will return to her wonted purity."</p> 
               <p>"I shall never see it, nor even have the desire to," returned Steinmitz gloomily.</p> 
               <p>"Why so sad? Already a brighter day is dawning for us. I feel it is so, and have not felt so light-hearted for months."</p> 
               <p>"You can be cheerful-you have never been carried as an accused felon from among your fellows; never felt the innumerable eyes of the city's throng probing your soul as it shrank away from their mocking gaze-you have never seen a prison's door shut you out from the world, and felt in your heart that it separated you for ever in this world from honest men's companionship-nor even have you felt the silence and ignominy eating into your brain, until you could not think, nor pray, but only cry, What have I, in all my long life of cheerful labor, done to deserve this?"</p> 
               <p>"Father! Father!" cried Ellis with a choked voice,<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5770-00000083"/> "do not say so. No one thinks less of you now than they did before!"</p> 
               <p>"No, we all know you could not be guilty, and you wrong your friends by harboring such a thought," returned Mr. Connelly in a sad earnest tone.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> know me; others do not! Where am I now to find labor? who will employ an accused felon? who will restore the good name that I inherited, and have kept these long years untainted by suspicion?"</p> 
               <p>"We must ferret out the one that has caused suspicion to fall on you, and thus free you from it," said Paul eagerly.</p> 
               <p>"It will be useless to make the endeavor. I feel the toils of an enemy around me, and they are hourly crushing me. They have done what labor and deprivation could not do-they have made me old and feeble-they have robbed me of my life and strength."</p> 
               <p>"Father! Oh, father! come away to our own home; you will be better there," and Ellis and Charles led him away while he, the stalwart man, bowed and broken in spirit, leaned feebly on them; and Mr. Connelly, Paul and Shiffler wended their way silently, thoughtfully, to their homes.</p>

               <argument> 
                  <p>Conference between the Confessor and the Arch-Bishop-Their plans to break up the American meetings, and their opposition to the growing Republican sentiment-Another outpouring of the people in Independence Square-The Confessor and Arch-Bishop, dressed as common citizens, approach the stand of the speakers-Remarks of the Rev. Dr. Berg and Mr. Tarr-Indictment of the Romish Church and the Pope-The Arch-Bishop's indignation-The two attempt to leave, but the Confessor is recognized-Miscellaneous Conversation-The Arch-Bishop warns the Confessor to be more vigilant in his schemes-His visit to a Priest of St. Philip De Neri-His return home.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>ON an afternoon a few days after the above decided expression of disapprobation by the people, the Confessor sat alone with the Arch-Bishop in the parsonage.</p> 
               <p>"Did I understand you to say that this turbulent disposition was spreading among the lower classes of the Catholics?" asked the Arch-Bishop, as if continuing an idea no wise pleasing, but still necessary to pursue. (See Note 43.)</p> 
               <p>"Not the lower classes, my Lord, they are faithful and obedient, but a higher grade, composed mostly of those whom we have allowed to rise in the world from the station to which they were born. It was this class of Plebeians that overthrew the government of the Patricians<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5770-00000084"/> at Rome, beheaded St. Louis XVI., at Paris, placed Elizabeth, the Usurper, on the throne of England, and murdered their lawful Queen, Mary, and would here annihilate us, if they had the power."</p> 
               <p>"Let them beware! I like not these movements; you may be mistaken, however, in the feelings of the Catholics, and may have confounded the Catholics and heretics together."</p> 
               <p>"Hardly. You will soon have a chance to judge for yourself, however, as it is nearly time for this band of lawless heretics to collect for their orgies."</p> 
               <p>"You have not been quick and still enough in your operations. In New York the Bible was suppressed in two-thirds of the schools and the politicians leading the first great political party in the State won over to our interests, before the people were aware that any reform was in contemplation. Then, they were in our power, and after a few faint struggles which, in several boisterous meetings died away, and are now nearly forgotten. This is our only way of entire success. The more they squirm the quieter we must be, and never show ourselves except in the absence of excitement."</p> 
               <p>"We were as wary and cautious as we deemed would subserve the interests of the Church," humbly returned the Confessor; then he added, in a deprecating tone: "I understood you, at the Council of the St. Leopold, to recommend more stringent measures."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"So I did; yet I had no thought that the heretics would make so much resistance-I supposed them lulled into a deeper sleep than to awaken so easily."</p> 
               <p>"They are jealous and tenacious of an infringement of this thing they call <emph>Liberty.</emph> The Philadelphians are a matter-of-fact people, who never act in haste, and therefore, when they do, the act is ominous. I heard that uttered and loudly applauded at the Old Brick Meeting House the other night, which ought to consign the heretics who uttered it to prison for life."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, I can form a better opinion of the course it is most politic to pursue, after I have seen of what class these agitators are composed. I am glad you, without delay, informed me of their proceedings, which must indeed be formidable, if they cannot be circumvented by timely, energetic policy."</p> 
               <p>When the two arrived at Independence Square they were astounded at the scene that presented itself before them. The Square and avenues leading to it were already crowded, and still multitudes were pressing thither. There was no outward excitement; no noise or confusion. There was the millionaire and day-laborer side by side; the merchant and mechanic mingling with the inborn dignity and noble reliance in the cause of truth and right beaming from eyes that could not look upon tyranny, no matter whence it came, from hearts that knew not how to quail at aught but sin and slavery. Were these the men who had been<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5770-00000085"/> suffered to rise from the station to which they were born? Surely freemen's blood flowed in their veins-lighted their countless upturned dauntless eyes-mantled their truthful brows. There was no vassalage there, not even of the soul. You saw that by the free open speaking countenance that cannot dissemble. They are free to act as the heart shall dictate; free to worship God as the soul shall prompt; and lead them, whether it be in the gorgeous temple, the humble house of prayer, or the calm majesty of the depth of the silent forest. This right is their brother's as well as their own, and all they ask is to be left to the mode of adoration of their Maker that is most congenial, most elevating, subduing, purifying to their own souls.</p> 
               <p>"By our Lady, I thought not of this," whispered the Arch-Bishop, as his eye took in at a glance the thousands before him-the importance of the collection of such men for such a purpose.</p> 
               <p>"It is even worse than I, knowing as much as I did, anticipated. It seems the excitement has spread rapidly, else most of these fanatics have assembled out of idle curiosity."</p> 
               <p>"Nay, they have not. I understand human nature too well to suppose, for a moment, that this calm strength of purpose, which is seen in the face of every person present, arises from idle curiosity. There is a stern purpose in their hearts which, I fear, will work us evil if not counteracted."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"This assembling of the people is all wrong; and we shall never make any progress until it is stopped, as your Grace remarked in the Council. One such meeting as this will promulgate more heresy than we can do away with in a year!" (See Note 44.)</p> 
               <p>Pressing onward, they came within a few yards of the speaker's stand. The meeting was already organised, and the Secretary was reading the report of the previous meeting.</p> 
               <p>"Who have they in the chair?" demanded the Arch-Bishop, in a low tone</p> 
               <p>"George App, from Kensington, as arrant a heretic as was ever suffered to live! And, look you yonder," continued the Confessor, "the group by that Elm are members of my flock, and have caused me trouble enough to damn every one of their souls."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! who are they that thus presume to attend such unsanctified gatherings? But, listen!" he continued, "some one is about to speak, and his manner and tone bespeaks him worthy a better calling."</p> 
               <p>"That is another arch-heretic: Dr. BERG they call him."</p> 
               <p>"Some of our citizens," pursued the speaker, "have said that the clergy should not take hold of this subject at all. I deem it necessary to say this, and also to urge three good reasons why I should be here. The first is-I am an American. The second is-I am a Protestant. The third reason is that-I am an ambassador of Jesus Christ.<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5770-00000086"/> Now, if there are any here who object to my appearance as a minister; or, if it displeases them, they may look upon me as an American citizen, or a plain private man. I stand here in defence of the Bible, as a Patriot, as an American, and as a Protestant."</p> 
               <p>"That man will work us mischief, if he is suffered to go on in this way. Have then the Churches no friends on the ground to stop him?" said the Arch-Bishop with an angry flashing eye. (See Note 45.)</p> 
               <p>"I fear not one disposed to do it but ourselves!"</p> 
               <p>"We should betray and ruin ourselves in the attempt. No, no, what I want is, some of the lowest of our Church to incite a row and break up the assembly. It strikes me it might be done, if we had fifty or a hundred faithful Catholics here of the right stamp."</p> 
               <p>"There are none of the right stamp on the ground. The faithful would never, without orders, assemble to listen to a heretic."</p> 
               <p>"True," returned the Arch-Bishop.</p> 
               <p>"American citizens," continued the speaker, "are bound to take this ground in defence of the Bible, for it declares emphatically and unequivocally that, the nation who forgets it shall perish, and I, as an American citizen, feel bound to raise my voice against every encroachment of Anti-Christ. No matter what may be his political party feelings, yet I stand here and do assert, he is bound to stand for and support the Bible in the public institutions<pb n=""/> of his country. Go into your Senate Chambers, your Congressional and Legislatives Halls, and what do you see there? Do you see the Bible displaced by the Koran, or the decrees of the Council of Trent?" (See Note 46.)</p> 
               <p>"No! no! we see the Bible there," burst spontaneously from the twenty thousand freemen assembled, in tones decisive and loud enough to have been the knell to any ambitious scheme less dominant and determined than that which ruled that haughty Prelate's heart.</p> 
               <p>"Look at the attempt," he continued, "to drive the Bible from the Public Schools in all its bearings. Here are our children, who by the march of religion, experience, and improvements, fill our schools. They are fast growing up to maturity-and they see an effort to drive the Bible from the Schools, and suppose the effort to be successful; what would these children say in after years, if they should go into a Court of Justice, and the Bible should be handed to them to swear by? What would they say? 'Sir, I cannot touch that book-why in your Public Schools you taught me to disregard the Bible and do you think I will regard it now?'" (See Note 47.)</p> 
               <p>"We must win over that man to our Church, by sophistry or money," said the Arch-Bishop in a low tone, as the long loud cheers with which the speaker was greeted rose and rolled along that vast concourse of freemen, its every note a knell to the all-absorbing passion which had<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5770-00000087"/> so fearfully perverted the many talents his Maker had entrusted to his keeping.</p> 
               <p>"He is perverse and obdurate in his heresies. I know him well. You could not move him."</p> 
               <p>"Then, we must prevent his promulgating his heresies! Another one is speaking-whom have we now? It is always best to know and mark our adversaries."</p> 
               <p>"That is Mr. E. D. Tarr, one of the most busy fomenters of discord."</p> 
               <p>"Gentlemen," said Mr. Tarr, "the city and county of Philadelphia have found a true bill against the Pope, and indicted him for various misdemeanors. You, here assembled, constitute a jury to try him. There are five counts in this bill-</p> 
               <p>"The first count is-opposition to Social and Religious Liberty.</p> 
               <p>"The second is-a secret design to enslave the people.</p> 
               <p>"The third is-an attempt to deprive us and our children of Heaven's best gift to man-the Bible.</p> 
               <p>"The fourth is-an attempt to subvert our rights and mar the temple of Liberty-tearing away their chief and only pillar-God's Holy Word!</p> 
               <p>"The fifth is-an attempt to join Church and State, and set up the authority of the Pope of Rome as supreme and infallible."</p> 
               <p>There was a breathless silence as these acts of aggression were read, which continued during several addresses to that<pb n=""/> jury of twenty thousand citizens. At its conclusion, Mr. Tarr put the question-"Is the Pope, as here indicted, guilty or not guilty?"</p> 
               <p>The spell was broken, and a simultaneous shout of "<emph>Guilty,</emph>" broke again and again like the waves of a resistless sea, from those who had silently, sternly weighed the "Man of countless Crimes" in the balance, and found him wanting.</p> 
               <p>"Guilty! Guilty!" That one word fraught with crime and woe, swelled clarion-like over the Union, and from its utmost recesses-even from the hamlets of the husbandman and the cabin of the woodsman-echoed back the sound, "Guilty!" There is no spot untainted by the accursed trail.</p> 
               <p>Never sat man charged with crime before such a jury of twenty thousand assembled freeman-and never before since the memorable Fourth of July, 1776, were usurpation and insidious wiles so sternly peremptorily rebuked, as they there met on the same ground where, of yore, first dawned the Declaration that has since, like divine love, shed life and happiness upon us.</p> 
               <p>Was that sentence of Guilty ominous of freedom from surveillance from a foreign potentate? Would that sound as it rolled up from the hearts of those freemen reach the Papal throne, at Rome, and bid it fortify itself upon its old rotten foundation? for all hope that it could ever be reared in young Republican America had shrunk away abashed<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5770-00000088"/> and rebuked, before men whose watch-word was, "God, the Bible, and our <emph>Native Land.</emph>" (See Note 48.)</p> 
               <p>"This is too much," whispered the Arch-Bishop. This assemblage is unlawful, and shall be broken up. We will make our way out of the crowd and see if we cannot find some means to do so."</p> 
               <p>"If some of our people were on the ground we could soon find cause to break it up."</p> 
               <p>The attempt to make their way out unobserved was, however, useless, for they attracted the attention of a man who, recognizing the Confessor, bowed slightly and said-</p> 
               <p>"Take warning by the spirit you have already aroused, and profit by it!"</p> 
               <p>"Insolent!" retorted the Confessor, when the Arch-Bishop drew him back to their former position, as he said-</p> 
               <p>"Why did you retort? Not a word more to the heretics while we are on the ground. I dread being recognized, as I assuredly should be, if the people's attention were not so intently fixed on the speakers."</p> 
               <p>An hour longer were they kept in that uncomfortable position, hearing nothing which pleased, but much which exasperated them, when, to their intense satisfaction, the meeting broke up, and they soon reached the Parsonage.</p> 
               <p>"Am I to understand this feeling of discontent extends generally through all classes?" said the Arch-Bishop, breaking a moody silence which he had maintained so<pb n=""/> long that the Confessor began to tremble for his own safety, fearing his Superior held him in his own mind accountable for the outburst of patriotism which so agitated the people.</p> 
               <p>"I can hardly judge, my Lord, since the exhibition we have had this afternoon," returned the Confessor evasively.</p> 
               <p>"You saw members of your flock, I believe you observed, on the ground. Are they usually contumacious? How do they presume to attend such unholy gatherings?"</p> 
               <p>"They set at nought my remonstrances; and I have even used the rigorous measures approved by our Church, to bring them back to their duty, but without avail. I am at a loss what course next to pursue in regard to them."</p> 
               <p>"Have you tried the anathemas of excommunication?"</p> 
               <p>"Not yet, my Lord: I reserved that as a last resort."</p> 
               <p>"Then lose no time in doing it. There are few men can brave that awful curse! The more I see and hear, the more I am convinced that we can only enforce our reform by a steady, firm, unyielding course. We must, however, be wary, and use force towards the heretics only when we can make it appear we are defending ourselves. But it is different with our own people. Lay your hand heavily on the unruly, and make them feel and know what it is to incur the penalties of the Church. Probably there will be other assemblages of the people. Be vigilant, and should there be, scatter among them enough of tough, hardy fellows to keep down any insolent remarks on our Church, or His Holiness. Perhaps it will create disturbances, in<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5770-00000089"/> which none of our leading men must, in any case, be found. It would be better to be within sight, if it can be done without detection; but in no case otherwise. I have great confidence in your zeal and discretion, and leave all with you." (See Note 49.)</p> 
               <p>The next morning the Arch-Bishop took leave of his coadjutor, saying he must be at home that day-but instead of taking the early train, he repaired to the Parsonage of St. Philip De Neri, where he found a Priest of that Church awaiting him. A long private conference was held which lasted till noon-day. At last he come forth, seeming well pleased with what had transpired, for he remarked to the Priest on parting-</p> 
               <p>"Observe well, and let nothing transpire of which I am not informed, and above all, keep your eye on the Confessor," and an hour after he was on his way home.</p> 
               <p>Home-it had, alas, no meaning for him! for there the pale, still suffering Lillian reminded him of the past, while the innocent laughing, beautiful Enna, so like the lost one, constantly, though silently, upbraided him, that he did not obey the laws of nature that pleaded so at his heart to proclaim her before the world-the child of his lost Isabel!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>Boston rejoiced at the firm stand which Philadelphia had taken-Stringent secret movements of the Jesuits-Their efforts upon the unsuspecting citizens-The people aroused-The Arch-Bishop becomes alarmed-The Priests attempt to take the Bible from the Public Schools-Strong opposition to the movement-Sister Mary and her betrayers-Outragous Catholic proceedings-They contine Sister Mary in a dungeon-Her entreaties with the Mother Superior to release her-Her refusal to listen-Sister Mary offers her supposed legacy to be set free-She is told that the Church was already in possession of it-Its sad effects, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>BOSTON, proud in her own moral strength with which she had so often checked and rebuked the foes of Liberty, hailed with joy the manly, firm stand that Philadelphia had taken. Not for a moment did she dream that, even then, the poison was eating into her very heart; that in hundreds of families spies were lurking under a meek servile garb, the insignificance of their position protecting them from suspicion or detection. Not a plan for amusement was discussed-not a subject broached but that was carefully treasured and weekly poured into the Confessor's ears. Even the most minute pecuniary affairs that came under a servant's eye, as well as the guests of their masters, and what was the theme of conversation while present, were alike treasured up as many precious morsels,<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5770-00000090"/> to glut the rapacious curiosity of those who had instituted this most galling mode of espionage. Yet, so it was; many a family, guiltless of aught that should breed distrust, and ignorant alike of a foe or danger, saw friends turn coldly from them with an air of distrust, and perchance ere long heard the low mutterings of calumny as they gathered unseen, unknown whence they came, around them. Could they have known the foe that had thus aimed its deadly arrows at them by striking at all they held most dear, they could have proved its falsity and choked the reptile with its own venom. This monster was too securely concealed around the domestic hearth for betrayal; for, though relatives, and even parents and children fell under the ban of betraying their kindred, the servile spy, the docile, meek-eyed servant never was distrusted. (See Notes 50 and 51.)</p> 
               <p>This lurking of spies around our firesides, even in our chambers in the silent watches of the night, extended all over the Union. The information thus collected for the Confessors, was faithfully transmitted to the Arch-Bishop, who shaped his course thereby, to a great extent. The St. Leopold worked to a charm: by it he counteracted much of the opposition of the Protestants to his plans-and by it he knew the general political feeling with which these movements were regarded, even before such a feeling had found vent in public expression.</p> 
               <p>Man met his brother man with distrust, and passed him<pb n=""/> with a feeling of relief, for every one looked suspiciously upon each other, not knowing how soon a ban might, un seen, unknown whence it came, fall upon himself. Still, they slumbered on, nursing the poison that was gnawing at their heart's core-feeding it with their honor, fame, and even life.</p> 
               <p>The causes that had driven the friends of Liberty to form Republican combinations in other cities, the New Englanders had not supposed existed also in their midst, until they had became rooted, as they had in New York; but rousing themselves at last, they also prepared to defend what yet remained to them of all their forefathers had bequeathed.</p> 
               <p>Awakened finally to her danger, after suffering the Bible to be driven from thirty-six of her Schools, New York also arose in her might, and nominated a Republican for election as Mayor, before the people, in opposition to a Papist candidate. Started from his fancied success at this action of the people, the Arch-Bishop was alarmed for the success of his schemes, which now hung on either their action in stifling this awakened feeling of hostility to his infringement of their rights, or pushing them through at all hazards, and trusting to their influence to maintain them in defiance to opposition, which they flattered themselves would soon die away, and leave them victors of the field. (See Note 52.)</p> 
               <p>"These Americans are a versatile people," said Mr. McMaster, while discussing this point with the Arch-Bishop<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5770-00000091"/> hop, "and will turn from the subject not caring who is victor, as soon as some new object attracts their attention. Were some new singer, or dancer to be imported next week, these same men would harness themselves to her coach, and obedient to her lash, drag her through the streets with shouts and huzzas. Excitement they must and will have, and they do not care so much about what it is as the tumult and noise they can extract from it." (See Note 53.)</p> 
               <p>"I wish I could think as you do," returned the Arch-Bishop, "but the importance of a right estimation of both sides of the subject in order to render every movement we make effective, and the knowledge of them gained by a long study of their salient points, forbids me to entertain your opinion. I have seen them stoop to demean themselves as coachmen, and there they sought for amusement. I have also seen them assembled as freemen, and there they were stern-unyielding, with an expression in their faces such as I have fancied the Roman Tribunes wore when, unyielding to their conqueror, they awaited defiantly in the senate-chamber his approach, with their robes of office around them, that they might die where their country had placed them."</p> 
               <p>"To me they looked like a pack of wolves," retorted McMaster, "for whom there ought to be a bounty for slaying. I am sorry our opinion of them differs so widely." (See Note 54.)</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I certainly should not care if there was, did I not prefer a bloodless victory. But if it is necessary, I shall not shrink from obtaining it by other means. The opinion I expressed I really entertain, but in entertaining it, I do not lessen my determination to compel them to obey the allegiance they, by divine right, owe His Holiness, Christ's Vicar on earth. The nomination of this Harper, I fear, will lead to serious results. He is a popular citizen, and altogether, is an opponent to be dreaded. Still, we must defeat him, for much of our future success will depend upon having in such important offices those friendly to us. The Catholic vote and influence will be thrown against him, and with this aid we may safely look for his defeat." (See Note 55.)</p> 
               <p>The accumulated wealth of Frederick Levering had already gone to swell the coffers of the same power that drove his forefathers from their native shores to dwell among the then unbroken wilds of this continent. The same power that gave his dying daughter shelter, that her beautiful child, the only heir to his vast wealth, might fall into their hands, to be trained as best suited their views. Years had they, with steady pertinacity, been at their task, and had so wound their toils around the old man, who had been led to believe not one of his kindred remained to him, that his wealth must inevitably fall into their hands or that of the State. They retained possession of the heiress, Cecelia Moreton, under the name of<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5770-00000092"/> Sister Mary, with the proofs of her parentage to be used as a last resort, trusting to their influence over her to surrender her right to it to the Convent, in which they had induced her to take the veil. Naturally passionate and spirited, she set at naught all discipline, which they dared not enforce on her, as they knew not how soon they might require her to appear as the legal heir of her grandsire, and they feared to offend her by severe discipline, or disgust her by restraint.</p> 
               <p>She had passed a few years thus, growing into womanhood with strong, undisciplined passions, beautiful, imperious, and longing for a wider range than within the Convent walls, when the Arch-Bishop saw her, and offered her a home at the palace, as a companion to his sister who superintended his house for him. Any change she thought, if it brought variety, would be for the better, and gladly she accepted it. The Mother Superior saw her beautiful, wilful charge borne away with a cold sinister smile on her thin lips; but she dared not remonstrate, or even warn the young unsophisticated girl of the home that she accepted so gladly.</p> 
               <p>Sister Geneve never left the foot of the altar the night that the portal was crossed by that innocent girl, but where she knelt at eve she was found at dawn, still praying-still imploring for aid from on high.</p> 
               <p>Time passed, and Sister Mary's aid was not required to secure the old man's wealth to the Church, and they now<pb n=""/> looked upon her as a person they had no need to use for their interest, but one whom it would be necessary to keep for ever cloistered, for fear of trouble in the future. This came sooner than had been anticipated by even themselves, for the night after her rupture with the Arch-Bishop she was driven in a carriage to the Convent door, attended by the Arch-Bishop's servants, bearing a letter to the Mother Superior, the import of which was to keep her in solitary confinement, as she was in possession of the secrets of the Church, which must never be revealed-not even to the nuns of the Convent. (See Note 56.)</p> 
               <p>With a smile, half sardonic, the Mother Superior received her charge and the letter, and led away the half unconscious Sister Mary to her own bed-chamber when, after carefully locking the door, she pressed a panel in the wainscoting, which opened, revealing a stairway lighted by a window looking out into the Convent garden. Down this stairway, she half led, half carried the bewildered girl, who had exhausted her mental and physical faculties in her frantic endeavors to release herself. When they reached the bottom of the stairs the Mother Superior unlocked a door at the right, entered, and seating Sister Mary on the rude cot, taking her lamp with her, left her alone in her damp cell, ventilated and lighted only during the day by a narrow grated window let into the side, at the top of the cell, and looking out on the stairs by which the cell had been gained.</p> 
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5770-00000093"/> 
               <p>Exhausted nature here gave way, and sister Mary fell back unconscious upon her cot. Long she remained thus, before youth and a vigorous constitution triumphed. When consciousness returned she was weak, but fully capable of realizing her unhappy, nay, critical situation. The whispered tales she had heard from the nuns before she had left the Convent, of the existence of secret cells, with their vague hints and surmises of their being made the prison house of those who offended their Superiors, now rushed upon her, and caused her hasty stubborn heart to quail. Darkness had always had vague undefined terrors for her, and now as she nestled on her straw mattress, with its thick impenetrable mantle drawn closely around her, it seemed to stiffle her, and gasping for breath, she shrieked and called for help, until exhausted she again found relief in unconsciousness. When she again awoke to life and misery, the faint beams of early dawn came like an angel of light to bless her with its rays, and with joy and gratitude such as she had never felt before for life's blessings she hailed its brightening beams.</p> 
               <p>The hours passed away, and as the sun arose higher, it poured a flood of light through the outer window, into the stairway, lighting up the cell through the narrow grated window which looked down upon youth, beauty and a warm impassioned heart shut out from the world, and deprived of all that makes life a blessing or desirable.</p> 
               <p>The Mother Superior came at last with food and water<pb n=""/> when Sister Mary demanded to be released in no gentle tones.</p> 
               <p>"You must be content where you are; you have incurred the displeasure of the Church, therefore, it is fitting she should vindicate herself by a penalty."</p> 
               <p>"I care not for the Church; I hate and despise it," cried Mary, passionately. "Release me, or I will claim protection at the hands of the law, and complain of you for forcibly detaining me against my inclination."</p> 
               <p>"You may, if you ever get the chance. You have had your day of pleasure, and now must take what follows. When you left I saw the end to which you were surely hastening. Others have been over the road before. It is well trodden by youth, and its sides are strewn by the withered rose buds which have lost their value ere they bloomed."</p> 
               <p>"Mother," said Sister Mary, laying her hand on the Pythoness' arm, "I shall be one day the heiress of great wealth, release me and half is yours; then you can leave this spot where I cannot believe you were ever happy."</p> 
               <p>"Poor child!" she returned, in a softened tone, "think you that if I was to leave, there is an inhabited spot on this globe where I should be safe, where the Church could not find me, and take my life as a penalty for my desertion? No, no!" she added bitterly, "once embarked on the Church's fleet, and there is no looking back except at the risk of life!"</p> 
               <pb n="188-189 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5770-00000094"/> 
               <p>"Our countrymen, and our laws will protect us. Oh, Mother, do not refuse me! nay, my all shall be yours! I claim nothing but liberty, and the free air to move in, and breathe. Let me go, and I will bless you and my mother in Heaven, who gave me in your care will, from on high, bless you!"</p> 
               <p>"Your mother was a heretic, and can not even bless herself. And were I to release you, which I dare not do had I the inclination, you would have nothing to give. Your Grandfather died months ago without even knowing of your existence, and in dying gave his all unconditionally to the Church."</p> 
               <p>Astounded at what she heard, Sister Mary, ghastly pale, her flashing eyes rivetted on the faded, wrinkled face of the Mother Superior, whose eyes shrunk away from her she knew in her breast she so foully wronged. (See Note 57.)</p> 
               <p>"Tell me, truly, as you hope for heaven," said Sister Mary, at last, "was not my Grandfather aware of my existence?"</p> 
               <p>"He was not," slowly, but firmly returned the Superior.</p> 
               <p>"Why, then, have you deceived me thus? Why did you detain me here, when I would have willingly hastened to his side, and on my knees craved forgiveness for my mother's errors."</p>

A spirit like hers could not be forcibly restrained without impairing the tenement, and day by day as her eyes grew dim, and her cheeks pale, the Mother Superior saw with exultation that the strife would soon be ended, that but a few weeks would elapse before she would pine away, and not a vestige would be left to dispute the great wealth of Levering with the Church. This was the ostensible reason the Arch-Bishop had informed her of in confining the lawful heiress. But the Mother Superior had held her situation too long not to surmise that other reasons were behind these, still she was too shrewd to allow them to appear on the surface, and obeyed her Superior, the Arch-Bishop's commands, well knowing that such an order required solitary confinement, and she contented herself that it was attended with no bloodshed.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps her slumbers were disturbed by the maniac-like screams that came faintly to her ears nightly through the solid walls; or perchance she wearied of making the daily pilgrimage to the cell, where the sight of her victim with her yesterday's food untasted beside her, smote her heart. She dared not show mercy, although the poor girl on her knees, and in the name of the God who made them, besought it with piteous wailings that came laden with life-blood from her breaking heart.</p>

               </argument> 
               <p>THE third night after Martin Gaven's visit to Father Francis it was his watch; for, conscious of the crime their grim walls concealed, they never left day nor night, their Convent unguarded. This was the time he had determined to fly, and in his flight bear away the suffering Father Francis, whose cell he cautiously, stealthily gained, hoping to find him recovered sufficiently to accompany him on his flight. Gently he laid his hand upon him, supposing he slept, when the death-sensation thrilled through every nerve and caused him to recoil with horror. Throwing the light of the dark lantern full on his face, he murmured-</p> 
               <p>"Another victim! Oh, God! when shall this cease?" Closing his lantern he noiselessly returned as he came to his post, and when assured that all reposed within the Convent, let himself out of the small wicket gate by a<pb n=""/> duplicate key he had, days before, procured for this purpose, and fled towards the city. When morning dawned he had gained the quay, and in an hour after he had shipped for Philadelphia, in a trading vessel that was weighing anchor as he gained her deck. Swinging out, the ship soon gained the Gulf. Not till then had Gaven felt entirely safe from pursuit, which he well knew would be instituted. Now he breathed free and trod the deck with a feeling of relief, such as he had not felt before since he entered the tortuous paths marked out for him by his Superiors. Gaven knew his pursuers would not content themselves by confining their search to the district whence he had fled; but fancied that, should it extend to the northern Protestant cities, he would be safe from persecutions which would affect his life and liberty. On arriving at his destination he landed, and had not been more than an hour on shore, when two men approached him, and entering into conversation with him by civil unimportant observations; and on his unguardedly replying to one of them that he was a total stranger to every one in the city, invited him to enter their carriage which was near, and accompany them to their hotel which they assured him was the best home for strangers that the city afforded. Thankful for the tone of sympathy they displayed for his welfare, he gladly accepted the invitation, and had already placed his foot on the carriage step to enter. One of the men held the door for him while the other stood behind him. As he raised himself on the<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5770-00000097"/> step; the inside of the coach with every door and window darkened, except that by which they were to enter, alarmed him. He had seen such coaches before. Turning quickly he encountered a triumphant gleam on his companion's face, which caused him to spring back to the ground, for in that tell-tale expression he saw the traces of the same power from which he had so gladly fled, and which he was now conscious had pursued him with lightning speed from the South.</p> 
               <p>"Leave me! I know your errand!" said Gaven slowly, as he retreated a few paces.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps, it is well you do," said one of them in a low soft tone, "for then, you will recognize the necessity of accompanying us without resistance."</p> 
               <p>"Never! I have had enough of the Church, and have done with her forever. Further pursuit of me will be unavailing; for I will no longer submit to her wicked, unholy dictation!"</p> 
               <p>"Resistance is useless. We have the power and can compel submission, if it is not voluntarily given;" returned the emissary. "For your own good I would advise you to return voluntarily to her arms, for she knows as well how to forgive as to punish. By such a course, you may be restored to her affections without punishment. We are authorized to say this to you, by our Superiors. In case you refuse the clemency of the Church, we can only<pb n=""/> say, you shut up the avenues of mercy and place yourself under its ban!"</p> 
               <p>"Did I not know, perhaps, even better than you, in what the mercy of the Church consists, I might be induced to place some faith in it. As it is, the Church while I live, shall never again have me in its power. Say to your masters that I am now free, and if they cease to annoy me the knowledge of their crimes which I possess shall forever sleep in my heart. If, however, they presist in dogging my footsteps, I will denounce them before the laws they have outraged."</p> 
               <p>The thoroughfare on which they stood was crowded, and the two emissaries could do no more than attempt to persuade Gaven to a compliance; and when they saw all their endeavors abortive, one of them entered while the other mounted the box of the carriage, and rapidly drove away.</p> 
               <p>"Not even here, am I safe," murmured Gaven, as he sought out a spot where he could refresh himself in safety "Grievously am I paying the penalty of the crimes I have been forced to commit!" Then as his mind reverted to the horrors which he had left behind him, he thanked Heaven that it was no worse with him-that he was no longer forced to tear asunder the limbs of his fellow man, and listen unmoved to their shrieks and howls of agony, lest a betrayed sympathy would subject him to a like fate. As day after day passed away, he became painfully conscious<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5770-00000098"/> that whether he walked, rode, ate or slept, he was watched, he well knew by whom, that other eyes than those of casual observers were on him. Often by a quick movement he came face to face with them, when the spy would blandly turn away, as if in pursuit of some distant object.</p> 
               <p>Gaven had an Aunt, who had been intrusted by her brother with his education, and through whose influence he had accepted of the Priesthood. To her he resolved to go for advice, for the constant irritation caused by this dogging of his footsteps, daily became more intolerable, threatening, by robbing him of sleep and appetite, to undermine his health. This Aunt was the Mother Superior of a Convent, and the ready and able coadjutor of the Arch-Bishop's schemes. Gaven was aware of her devotion to the Church, but trusted to the ties of blood for her aid in his unhappy and perilous situation.</p> 
               <p>In safety he reached the Convent, and was soon closeted in a private parlor with his Aunt, who came in haste from her bed chamber, and locked the door as she entered. Her cheek grew pale, and her eyes blazed with a wild frightened light, as she recognized him.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! most imprudent man!" she cried, when she found utterance in her astonishment at his sudden appearance before her.</p> 
               <p>"You have heard then of my renouncing the Priesthood-and know why I have come to you?" he said sadly.</p> 
               <p>"If for defence, or protection, you have come in vain.<pb n=""/> I dare not give it, although it was my own son that asked it."</p> 
               <p>"No, Aunt, I can protect myself-or if I need aid my country will assist me. I have come to you for advice, for sympathy; I shun a public exposition, which must ensue if I am forced to throw myself into the arms of my country for protection."</p> 
               <p>"Unhappy man! think you the Church is so impotent as to allow you to do this? Know you not she could crush you to atoms at any moment she desired? You should have learned her strength before you defied her power." (See Note 58.)</p> 
               <p>"Have you, then, no counsel, no sympathy, nothing but reproaches to offer? Alas! is the path of rectitude which I fain, at this late hour, would follow, so strewn with thorns? I dreamed in those soul-sickening dungeons of days of calmness, and nights when my dreams would not be visited by repetitions of the day's terrible work. This led me to fiy from scenes from which I turned with loathing. This is my reward!-to be spurned by friends and hunted down by the Church, whose mandates I have hitherto been too willing to obey, even to staining my hands with blood!"</p> 
               <p>The Mother Superior shuddered. Not so much at the crimes Gaven had in the name of Christianity perpetrated, as at the destiny which awaited him, if he fell into the hands of his pursuers. She, like every other reliable<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5770-00000099"/> member of the Catholic Church, had been furnished with a description of his person and directed to entrap him if in her power, and retain him in custody until relieved by her Superiors, to whom she was to forward immediate intelligence of his arrest or whereabouts. Thus were the members of the Church created into so many spies, and every Catholic's domicil a prison-house. No wonder Gaven grew nervous, dispirited and tempted to cry out against the path of right, which he found thus beset with the untold horrors of a surveillance more galling and despotic than that of even the tiger-hearted Danton and Murat. She dared neither protect nor warn him of danger. During the long years she had occupied her position, not one act had she performed, no matter how secretly it was done, but that she had afterwards learned her Superiors were cognizant of it. Often had such acts drawn immediate reproofs, with warnings to be more circumspect in future. At other times, years elapsed before she was made aware that others were acquainted with what she had fondly dreamed already slumbered in oblivion. Should she give him up? A cold, sickening sensation deprived her of strength as this thought crossed her brain. Too well she knew his fate, and already she seemed to feel the terrible despair of the victim in his enemy's hands. The heart was not all dead in her, although she had for years been stifling its throbbings at the sound of mercy's voice. She could not have kept it silent now if she would. Her blood<pb n=""/> also flowed in his veins, and his mother had slept during a peaceful childhood by her side, and with her was tenderly nurtured in the same mother's arms. As these thoughts flitted wildly through her mind, the floodgates of her heart, which she had fortified with almost every species of crime, gave away before the sad, imploring eyes of her kindred who, in his extremity, had besought her for counsel and aid.</p> 
               <p>"Come," she said, rising, "there is danger here, and whatever occurs watch me closely and obey in silence. It is our only hope for safety. You have ventured even into the Lion's den; for here you are most sure of detection. Trust me implicitly, I will save you if in my power-if not we will perish together. I too am weary of this life!" she added in a whisper, as she opened her chamber door and led him in. Concealing him as best she could, she left him, and locking the door, he was alone.</p> 
               <p>The day passed away and when night returned, the Mother Superior entered her chamber, with some delicacies for him, of which she pressed him to partake. After counselling him as to his future acts, she prepared a mattrass in her room, and bade him slumber there in safety.</p> 
               <p>"If I can keep you concealed here a few weeks, I shall hope to evade the anger of the Church. No one ever enters my chamber but by my permission, and as I have reason to believe your entrance here was unnoticed, except by the porteress, whom I have convinced you were a mendicant, and I have assured her that I dismissed you<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5770-00000100"/> myself from the gate. We must be cautious and prudent, and even here for a while you may tarry in safety."</p> 
               <p>Gaven laid himself on the mattrass and closed his eyes. But sleep was far from his over-wrought faculties. His brain danced fantastically, soared and groveled alternately, now compelling him to re-enact the revolting scenes of those horrible dungeons-then it bore him away to green fields and the pleasant groves of his childhood. The scene changed, and he was pursued by a monster he dared not even look upon. Thus the hours wore away when, he was conscious the Mother Superior was softly stealing from the room. At once a horrible suspicion crossed his thoughts. Was it possible she was dealing treacherously with him? Maddened by the thought, he resolved to steal forth and escape before she could accomplish her purpose. He had half arisen when the door softly opened, and he saw her enter, bearing in her hand a pitcher and a crust of bread. Laying gently down again, he feigned sleep and from his half closed eyes saw her press back a pannel in the wainscoting, which opened inwards, and into which the Mother Superior stepped and then disappeared, down! down! Gaven knew not where; yet he could surmise, schooled as he had been in mystery and crime. Should he follow and see? No, it might ensure his own destruction! He heard a key turn in its lock; and a door grate on its hinges. Then up from that dismal abode came a wail so piteous that once<pb n=""/> again he fancied the past a dream, and that in reality he was still within the walls of the Inquisition.</p> 
               <p>"Mother! Mother!" cried the voice, "leave me not again! See, I am dying! Oh, it is terrible to die here alone! I am so young! Mother! Mother! have pity and save me! Oh, God, she has no pity-no mercy!" He heard no more; the voice of the victim was shut out by the heavy clank of the door, and in a moment after, the Mother Superior appeared at the pannel, her pale face rigid and cold, when she stepped into the chamber and closed the door behind her.</p> 
               <p>This, then, was the woman to whom he had appealed for aid, into whose hands he had voluntarily placed himself; the keeper of dungeons, which rivalled those from which he had escaped.</p> 
               <p>The night wore away; but it brought no sleep to Gaven, who resolved at the earliest dawn to make his escape from a place so revolting. He could not look upon one who inflicted this living death upon a fellow being, without an uncontrolable shudder of loathing and disgust. When she spoke to him in the morning, he turned from her with a half muttered reply, but with a feeling as if a serpent had entwined him in its folds, and then turned to contemplate at leisure its victim.</p> 
               <p>She left him to attend to her duties; and then he began to examine the room to determine on the best facilities for escaping. Could he once get into the Convent grounds, he<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5770-00000101"/> hoped to scale the walls in safety; for to trust himself longer in his Aunt's hands, he dared not, nor yet let her know of his anxiety to be away from her control, lest she should divine the cause that urged him to this hasty step.</p> 
               <p>Perplexed and torn with conflicting emotions, he was at a loss how to extricate himself from the room. Voices in the adjoining parlor now attracted attention. One was that of the Mother Superior, while the other was that of a man, whose full round tones, now imperative and commanding, fell ominously on his ear, while hers trembling and deprecating came soothing and encouraging to his heart.</p> 
               <p>"My information, Madam," Gaven heard him say, "is reliable and authentic. The Renegade is within these walls!"</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my Lord, you wrong me by such assertions. Surely, my life-long service in our common cause should preclude the imputation."</p> 
               <p>"Traitoress! He spent the night in your chamber, with your connivance; and yet you have the impudence to deny all knowledge of him!"</p> 
               <p>"You do not believe this monstrous falsehood!" she returned with spirit.</p> 
               <p>"I do, by the Holy Virgin! and will produce the Renegade from your room, where he even now is. When this is done, I shall see that your services to the Church are, with interest, rewarded."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Gaven, who had applied his ear to the door, heard no more, for quick as thought a mode of escape flashed across his mind; and by availing himself of it, he would not compromise the Mother Superior who, to save him, had periled her own life.</p> 
               <p>Taking a bunch of keys from beneath the pillow where he had seen her place them, he pressed the pannel as he had seen her do when, to his joy, it opened, and stepping on the stairs within, closed it after him, as he heard amidst the expostulations of the Superior, and insulting imprecations of her companion, the door unlocked that led into the chamber which he had but a moment before left.</p> 
               <p>With a feeling of thankfulness for his temporary escape, he hastened down the narrow stairs, and applying a key to the first door, it opened and he found himself in a damp cell but dimly lighted. He supposed, there must be some egress to the world without through these vaults, and it was this flickering hope on which his safety depended. Disappointed that this door did not reveal it, he was turning away, when a low plaintive voice from a cot in a dark recess of the cell broke on his ear.</p> 
               <p>"Mother, mother! take me with you; it is so dark and lonely here, and I am so young to die! Mercy, mother! as you hope for mercy in the world to come!"</p> 
               <p>This, then, was the prisoner's cell the Superior had so stealthily visited the night before, and hers was the wailing<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5770-00000102"/> cry of despair that came from its dreary abode to his ear.</p> 
               <p>"Fear not, I will not leave you!" whispered he, as he bent over her, and saw in that wasted form and sunken eyes, the traces of youthful beauty, around which lingered lines of despairing agony.</p> 
               <p>"It is not the Superior! Who are you? And will you, indeed, save me? Do not refuse; for here in this cold, dark, damp dungeon, with no one to cheer, and not even the free air to breathe, I shall die! I know it; I feel it here!" and she laid her white hand upon her heart as she raised her eyes to his, in which he read such thoughts of agonized pleading as made him forget his own jeopardy in his desire to save the suffering being before him.</p> 
               <p>"I will save you, or perish with you! Such a life as this, is worse than death. To die then, would be gain if we fell in our attempts to insure our freedom. It cannot be all cells down here; there must be some passages, and if we can find them, there is hope for us."</p> 
               <p>"I have spent years in this Convent," said the prisoner, animated by the hope of freedom, "and have often heard the nuns say, there was an underground passage that led to the bay, and comes out under a high bluff that surrounds a cove, where the water is deep and boisterous."</p> 
               <p>"Then we may escape! Know you by what means an entrance to it may be found?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Alas, no! We were never allowed to enter the vaults beneath the Convent."</p> 
               <p>"Then we must find it. I have some tact that way; and if there is such a passage I will ferret it out."</p> 
               <p>"Take me with you! I fear you will forget the miserable Mary, when your escape is certain!"</p> 
               <p>"Never! I am not so lost to every principle of honor; though, Heaven knows, I have given few proofs of it. Come, but be noiseless, or we shall be circumvented by the blood hounds in search of us!"</p> 
               <p>Locking the doors behind them, so as to leave no proof as to what had been their course, the two hunted victims, trusting to God for success, stole along the narrow darkened passages which usually terminated at a cell like that they had left.</p> 
               <p>Nothing daunted, they still pursued their search, and at length entered a passage higher and broader than the others which they felt confident was the main passage, and one which, if indeed such existed, would lead them to safety. On, on they went through the darkness, which was now intense, their only guide the wall at the side, the wasted form of Mary half borne by the arm of Gaven, which the appealing, helpless being who leaned on it and looked up to for aid, strengthened by her presence. He felt in his heart the dawning of a sensation new and over-powering, which half obliterated his own sufferings, while it purified and ennobled his soul. Tenderly he supported<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5770-00000103"/> her sinking frame, soothing and encouraging her with the dawning of a new manhood into which this expansion of soul rapidly bore him. Never before had one gentle passion of his being been aroused. All had been dark, fierce and gloomy, crushing out of his nature every semblance of the heaven-born passions with which he, by his Creator, had been endowed.</p> 
               <p>No wonder then, that his heart throbbed wildly-joyously. When away from the recess of the soul where it had been driven and covered over with guilt and error, arose, in its strength the germ that binds man to his fellow man-man to his God. Their flight was long, and would have been tedious, had it not been beguiled by the recital of their mutual temptations and trials which they freely disclosed to each other, and which while they convinced each other of the enormity of the crimes perpetrated in the name of the Prince of Peace, only drew them closer to each other.</p> 
               <p>"The air is less foul than it was. We are nearing the outlet. Hist! I hear the sound of water breaking against the beach. See you yon glimmer of light?"</p> 
               <p>It was even so. The faint rays of light expanded as they drew nearer, while the pure fresh air played upon their fevered brows, laden with hopes of the freedom they would soon realize. They hurried on, and in a few moments came to the outlet, which was on a level with the bay at high tide. The entrance was concealed by trees<pb n=""/> and a thick luxuriant undergrowth of shrubs, among which they discovered a small boat drawn out of the water, and stowed away with the evident intent of concealment. The spot was wild, rugged and aptly chosen; for around it the serf rolled over rocks and sand bars that rendered a visit to it by water difficult and dangerous, while it was protected from above by the Convent grounds extending for miles around.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, earth!" cried Mary with her thin hands stretched forth longingly, "beautiful earth! with thy dark rolling sea; and thou fountain of heat and light, never until now, did I feel how sublimely beautiful thou wert!-never felt I before, the vastness of thy grandeur, or the freedom of the soul that is born, lives, and dies without a master, save <emph>thee</emph> oh, God! who giveth all to those whom thou hast stamped with thine image!"</p> 
               <p>Gaven launched the boat, and was in the act of placing the oars in their proper positions, when voices and approaching footsteps fell on their ears.</p> 
               <p>"Come in!" cried Gaven, "quick, for heaven's sake, they have tracked us, and we are lost if we hesitate!"</p> 
               <p>"Lost! lost! oh, God! we are lost!" exclaimed Mary in agony and terror, and sunk helpless and fainting to the earth.</p> 
               <p>Gaven sprang forward, caught her up as if she had been an infant, placed her in the boat, and pushed it from the shore as he clambered over its side, when from the passage<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5770-00000104"/> sage issued four men who plunged into the water and seized the oars. Throwing his weight on one of them, Gaven dealt a heavy blow against the temple of one of the ruffians who with a wild cry, sunk stunned into the waves, which completed the work Gaven had begun, for he rose no more.</p> 
               <p>"Back! back! you shall not take me alive! Back!" he cried, "or I will serve every one of you as I have your comrade."</p> 
               <p>With a laugh of derision they with their united strength, were drawing the boat ashore, having wrenched from Gaven the oars, which they tossed into the bay. Wrought to phrenzy by the jeopardy in which he stood, Gaven drew a knife and throwing himself upon one of his assailants plunged it thrice into his heart, when he was overpowered by the other two, disarmed, and dragged with the boat ashore, where he was left in charge of one of the men, while the other entered the boat for Mary, who was just awaking to consciousness to find her hopes crushed, and herself within the power of her enemies</p> 
               <p>"Never! never again alive will I return! Stand back!" she shouted, with a flash of her former haughty soul darting out from her broken spirit. Retreating as the man advanced, she poised herself on the guard of the boat, and exclaimed-</p> 
               <p>"Back! back! how dare you menace me thus? Back!<pb n=""/>

               <p>"Pray, Miss, don't attempt to frighten me. It will be only a waste of words. I know my duty, and will perform it!" said he in an insolent tone, as he stepped forward and reached forth his hands to grasp her. He was too late; for she sprang forward, her light form quivered a moment in the air, and then sank down to its cold cheerless ocean bed-the last and only home left to the heiress of three millions of dollars, by those who had sheltered the mother to obtain the daughter's wealth.</p> 
               <p>Gaven frantic at the peril of his companion in flight, broke away from his captor and plunged into the sea, but when he saw she rose not again, he struck out into the wide waste of waters before him, followed closely by the two ruffians in a boat. The race was for life and freedom, and was seen in the distance by a fishing smack, which bore down to the rescue of the swimmer, while the baffled ruffians returned to their masters.</p>

               </argument> 
               <p>NEW YORK had suffered herself to be led blindly captive; and had her captors been content with their conquest, she would still have hugged the chains that fettered and disfigured her majestic form. The wail of the oppressed fell unheeded on her ears. Commercial prosperity had perverted her heart; but it only slumbered. Her complacency gradually gave way under the indignities her captors heaped upon her; and an ominous contemptuous smile took its place, that deepened into a scowl of defiance when they paraded and surmounted the name of Coddington with a cross, authoritatively commanding the people to give him their votes for Mayor at the approaching election. She arose in her might, and then, to her dismay, learned her danger, and<pb n=""/> understood how nearly fatal had been her lethargy. (See Note 59.)</p> 
               <p>"Have we, indeed, a master?" man asked his brother, with an earnestness half credulous, as if wishing to be assured to the contrary. Still the ominous, incontrovertible facts were daily before them, daily bringing the blush of shame to their cheeks, for their unmanly compliance in surrendering the blood-bought liberty that the Pilgrim Fathers had bequeathed to them. In two-thirds of her Public Schools the Bible-that corner-stone of the Republic-had been suppressed! Her citizens were waylaid and maltreated if they spoke irreverently of the Church or its crimes, and even the law-makers of the Republic were assaulted if they refused to uncover their heads and do reverence publicly to her Bishops. Had she not need to blush for her manhood, when such debasing cringing acts were required of her? She had willingly, freely given the ramparts of her citadel into the hands of her enemies, and then wondered that they were treated as prisoners. Liberty's ever watchful eye was upon them. She saw with rapture that they had awoke, and marshaling them in a solid, unbroken phalanx, she led them to the rescue of their freedom-to the <emph>Polls.</emph> (See Notes 60, 61 and 62.)</p> 
               <p>The surging waves were stayed, and tyranny and oppression retired aghast, and cowering, uttered imprecations of baffled rage at their defeat; but Liberty plumed her wings, and circled with glad hosannas over the rescued<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5770-00000107"/> people, while they, so lately humbled, now strode proudly through their city, conscious of performing a noble duty, by rebuking their late masters, and asserting their allegiance only to the land of their birth and their Creator.</p> 
               <p>Mr. JAMES HARPER, the American Republican, had triumphed over his opponent who, with the whole foreign vote combined in his favor, stood rebuked and abashed before Liberty's searching eye. Did he then, think of the "Thirty pieces of silver?" or were these hirelings purchased for nought?</p> 
               <p>Philadelphia had, from the first, spurned the fetters-prepared for her; and, with loathing, trampled upon the sackcloth and ashes. Why should she suffer her children to be deprived of the light of Divine inspiration which her forefathers had with so much care, illumed their own footsteps from infancy to manhood? These children would, when they had passed away, take their places in the National Councils. If not fortified by the teachings of the Divine law, how were they to legislate with wisdom? If they, with the light of the word of God, found the path of life rugged and thorny, how were their children to travel it deprived of this light? Would they not fall and be crushed among the surging billows of sin and temptation, as they rolled along to engulph the unwary?</p> 
               <p>The people, assembled in Independence Square, had testified how revolting to her free born heart were these acts of aggression! Had this expression of her displeasure<pb n=""/> been heeded, she would have paused here. The serpent which she had warmed in her embraces, became aroused, because its designs of poisoning the bosom of its benefactors had been laid bare, and it now with a vindictiveness unparalleled in the past annals of their work, threw off all semblance of secrecy, and openly declared the American Republic should become subservient to the "Man of countless Crimes" at Rome.</p> 
               <p>On the morning of the sixth of May, the Confessor was alone in the parsonage. There was an impatient scowl on his brow, and a quick nervousness in his step, while he strode back and forth, alternately pausing, and with an eager glance surveying the street leading to his abode. The scowl on his dark visage gave way to one more humane, as the door opened, and a coarse brawny son of Erin stepped in, and with a cringing bow, apologized for his delay.</p> 
               <p>"Your Reverence! I could not come before, as John O'Neil and I had to hunt up boys of the right sort. We want them that can give and take hard knocks."</p> 
               <p>"You have been successful then?-and I may depend upon you?"</p> 
               <p>"Sure, your Reverence may. Pat Mullen never backs out of a bit of a free fight."</p> 
               <p>"But, this is to be no fight, unless you are attacked. Our object is to make these heretics strike the first blow. It will not answer our purpose to begin the fray; but, if<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5770-00000108"/> we can provoke them to aggression, we will give no quarter as long as any of these sons of perdition show themselves in the street. We have got to teach them a lesson, and the sooner it is done the better."</p> 
               <p>"Sure, then, we shall have no fight! Didn't they all run like cowards, and sons of cowards as they were, when we last Friday, run among them and flourished our shillalahs over their heads, and even pulled the staging from beneath them, until they come down in a heap? I mean all who had not run away. And when at the election, they saw us coming, didn't they suddenly forget to vote and think the best place for them was at home, as sure it is, for all cowards?"</p> 
               <p>"I know that, Pat,-still we must contrive to make them strike at least one blow. I care not then if they run to their hearts' content. We can say that we acted in self-defence. Have you got Pat Lafferty secured?"</p> 
               <p>"Sure an' he is true, but it is no use, your Reverence, for on Friday I threw down their flag myself, and trampling on it, called the cowards to come and take it if they dared. If they will take that, your Reverence, they haven't any fight in them."</p> 
               <p>"You have done some good, at least Pat,-you prevented their speaking and promulgating more heresies. This you must also do this afternoon. If, however, you can provoke them to attack you, defend yourselves to the utmost, you will have all your own way, for they will be unarmed<pb n=""/> armed, and I shall stand ready with my riflemen to charge on them in order to complete the work you begin."</p> 
               <p>"You shall be obeyed, your Reverence! We have got the carts all engaged with as merry a set of lads as ever handled a shillalah. If there is any fight in them, which, by the holy St. Patrick, I don't believe there is, we will bring it out!"</p> 
               <p>The Confessor was again alone with his own dark thoughts. Was then every sacred emotion of his heart obliterated? or, were they choked by the vast system of intolerance which claimed him, and in him found a valuable sentinel to guard its walls? Did he ever falter in the course which he was pursuing? Did not the peaceful homes and happy hearthstones which Liberty had given to all her children plead with him to be spared, that they might pursue the path so congenial to peace and prosperity? Where were those noble passions that are given by God to every being bearing the impress of His image; that they did not raise up and cry, "Shame! shame on such ingratitude to a people who have taken you freely to their homes and hearts! They have never looked upon you as a stranger, but have welcomed you as a brother. Shame! shame! Oh, creature, that thus degrades his manhood!"</p> 
               <p>The mid-day had passed, and the people began to throng towards the lot, at the corner of Second and Master streets, to which place they had been called, for a free expression of opinion in regard to rights guaranteed to them by the<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5770-00000109"/> Constitution. They came from all quarters of the city, and were men from all classes, order-loving men, who came forth to perform a duty due alike to their country and their children. The throng increased until a dense crowd filled the space. The speakers were already on the stand, above whom floated gracefully the stars and stripes, the staff supported by young SHIFFLER. Proudly its folds hovered above those freemen whose fathers had carried it in triumph wherever duty had led them, until they won for their country a name envied in the remotest corners of the earth. SHIFFLER gazed proudly on the ensign of his country; then, as he thought that, even in the land over which that flag floated, crimes of the darkest dye were perpetrated with impunity, a pang shot through his heart. "Yes," thought he,"if a Convent's walls surrounded a spot, there is immunity from justice. Behind them may languish and die a freeman, yet his country dare not scale those walls to release him. He may know that his country's colors float above him, but he knows, also, it is in mockery, for high above them towers the Cross. In it he sees the death's head and cross-bones upon the black banner, and in his despair calls on his God for the mercy refused to him by his brother."</p> 
               <p>A few rods distant from the throng of people, stood in a group a number of men, surrounding the Confessor, with fire arms in their hands, eyeing the scene before them with threatening gestures. These passed unheeded by the people<pb n=""/> ple, whose eyes were upon their Nation's colors that floated above them, inspiring them by the memory of noble deeds which clustered around them, to a purer, more devoted patriotism. At this crisis, J. R. KRAMER arose to address them.</p> 
               <p>"Come down from that you crocodiles, or I'll make you," yelled Pat Lafferty. Without heeding the interruption the Speaker commenced, but scarcely had he began, when carts loaded with dirt were driven into the crowd by Pat Mullen, and John O'Neill who, forcing their way through the astonished citizens to the front of the Speaker's stand, with coarse jests and taunting imprecations, emptied them, then drove away amidst the shouts of derision of several other carters who, following their leader's example, hurled taunts of cowardice at the citizens who, scarcely realizing the evidently premeditated insult, smothered their rising indignation. With difficulty arising from this unparalleled insult, borne so nobly by the citizens, the Address was concluded. GENERAL SMITH succeeded him in some conciliatory remarks, when he gave way to LEWIS C. LEVIN. The conduct of the carters now became insufferable. The indignation of the people broke forth in mutterings deep and fearful. Fortunately a torrent of rain at that moment poured from the clouds above them, and the assailed sought shelter in the Market House, close at hand, while the assailants fled to the Hibernia Hose<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5770-00000110"/> House, their own dwellings, and those of their friends adjoining. (See Note 63.)</p> 
               <p>Here sheltered from the rain, their flag again was unfurled, and the people attempted to reorganize their meeting. Pat Mullen, followed by his comrades, came pressing forward, shouting and taunting them, using every endeavor to frustrate their design, and by creating disorder to disperse, if they could not frighten them.</p> 
               <p>LEWIS C. LEVIN at length arose to address them. "Fellow citizens," said he, "we have reached an important crisis!" The words had hardly fallen from his lips, when Pat Mullen clinched in desperation the nearest citizen, and a scene of disorder ensued that, once seen, can never be forgotten; but language is inadequate to a description. It needed but this to kindle to a flame the smouldering wrath of the citizens who had borne aggression and injuries unparalleled, with patience and a noble desire to see themselves righted by the legitimate modes prescribed by the laws of their country. To this end had they assembled that day, and who will dare to say that American freemen have no right to assemble themselves peacefully and denounce or approve any of their law-makers as they may see fit? From the roofs, windows and loop-holes which had been prepared by their assailants, yards and alleys of the range of building in which the Catholics were safely ensconced, a destructive fire was opened upon the defenceless citizens by those within. Wild shrieks of<pb n=""/> agony rent the air from those who, in fleeing from the scene of danger, were wounded or maimed in their flight! Thrice had the flag fallen with young Shiffler who, hurling back his assailants, again raised aloft the stars and stripes, now riddled by the shots that were flying thick and fast around him. His light form dilated, and with flashing eyes he spurned back the miscreants who would have forcibly torn the sacred emblem from his hands. Never had a being occupied a prouder position; never was it more faithfully discharged. For, even then, with his assailants at bay, awed by the heroism so nobly displayed, a ball from the Hose House entered his heart, and he fell as he gasped, "Irene!-Mother!-Heaven!" with his Nation's flag gathered around him, true to it in death as he had been in life; for when they raised the young martyr his hands were already stiffening in death around it, while it was crimson with his life-blood. (See Note 64.)</p> 
               <p>Maddened at the sight of their dead companion, the citizens poured volley after volley of bricks and stones at their aggressors, which harmlessly rebounded from the buildings and fell in their midst; they then fled in every direction, but not before eleven of their number were wounded, some of them mortally.</p> 
               <p>This was only a temporary lull, for the citizens who had so long borne with every insult the misguided adopted foreigners had heaped upon them, were now aroused. They<pb n="222-223 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5770-00000111"/> were no cowards in that they had suffered thus far in silence; but like the lion that stood at bay eyeing the audacious pursuer who dared to trespass upon his rights and beard him even in his den-so the accumulated insults of years now arose before them, and they felt in their hearts that to put off further the day of atonement, would be only to allow these aggressions to augment in a fearful array.</p> 
               <p>With dread foreboding, the Speakers saw the rising of the tempest, and in the flaming eyes and dilated nostrils of the people, read the sternness of their purpose. Hope that the rising storm would lull, for a few moments, rose in their hearts as they saw the citizens disperse; but this was dispelled when they rapidly returned; now, like their assailants, armed with every description of offensive weapons, on which they had been able, in the impulse of the moment, to lay their hands. By hundreds and thousands they came, until they blocked up every avenue leading to the ground. Now the mutterings of the tempest burst into one long fearful roll of thunder. The cry of "Vengeance, vengeance for our wrongs! Vengeance for our insulted laws! And fearful vengeance for the blood of Shiffler!" arose like the blast of a trumpet, and fell with dreadful forebodings on the ears of the Confessor who, ensconced with his murderous crew, within the Hose House and buildings adjoining, had, with his own hand pointed<pb n=""/>

                  <pb n=""/> out the young hero as a mark for their rifles, as he stood there high above his fellows waving the flag of his country above them."</p> 
               <p>Several citizens recognizing the imminence of the peril, sprang upon the staging, still gory with the blood of the murdered Shiffler, and cried-</p> 
               <p>"Forbear! imbue not your hands in each other's blood!"</p> 
               <p>Their voices were not heard, or fell unheedingly on their ears, for at that moment a gang of Irish laborers, with fire-arms, and laden with missiles, bore down upon them from the Germantown Road, and pouring forth their deadly weapons and missiles scattered death among them. The citizens quickly rallied and drove back their assailants. Their position was disadvantageous, for the inmates of the Hose House and buildings adjoining, were thinning their ranks at a fearful rate. Several had already been carried dead from the field, while others had been borne away mortally wounded.</p> 
               <p>"This is no time to dally! We must drive the inmates from those buildings; follow me!" cried the eager voice of Gaven, who had been in the whole of the fray, and who now, regardless of danger, broke through the crowd, and armed with a heavy bludgeon, made for the rendezvous of their assailants. The people recognizing in his undaunted eye and carelessness of danger a master spirit, followed with loud huzzas, and attacking the buildings<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5770-00000113"/> with vigor, demolished the doors and windows, and drove out the armed ruffians who fired upon them as they fled. Great numbers of women now joined in the fray, and no tigress ever fought more desperately or frantically for its prey, than these did for their foreign masters. Their imprecations on the heretics, as they called the insulted citizens, were the most fearful, and their recklessness the most abandoned.</p> 
               <p>"By the Holy Virgin!" they yelled, as their unbound hair streamed around their hideously distorted visages, "we will this night, wash our hands in your hearts' blood, and send every heretic soul of you to burn in purgatory!" (See Note 65.)</p> 
               <p>Gaven led his victorious followers back to the Market House, when a wild appalling rumor greeted their ears! It was exclaimed-</p> 
               <p>"St. Augustine is turned into an arsenal and barracks, and at this moment, one thousand foreigners are armed within its walls, with great quantities of ammunition. St. Michael's, the Nunnery, and Parsonage adjoining are also fortified and armed, as well as St. Philip's, while the lay members are all armed by their Priests with deadly weapons, and are ready and threaten to massacre every Protestant citizen!"</p> 
               <p>"Much of this is true. I, within the hour, heard a threat to make a second St. Bartholomew of it before morning!" said Steinmitz who, driven to desperation by the<pb n=""/> persecution that had been so mercilessly pursued against him, joined with all the energies of his nature against the monstrous system which gave one man, and often a bad one, unlimited power over the temporal and spiritual life of his brother.</p> 
               <p>"If it is true," returned Paul, who had hastened hither, on hearing of the death of Shiffler, "is it a greater crime than those they are already guilty of? Tear away those walls there where mercy and justice are unknown; and then, when you have contemplated the untold horrors hidden there, tell me, if this is a more fearful crime, that it so chills your blood with horror and indignation!"</p> 
               <p>"You have all heard of Gaven, called 'The Renegade,' by his enemies?" asked their intrepid leader, in routing their assailants; "Look on me, for I am Gaven. While I was within their Convent walls, I witnessed that which I dare not tell. Oh, God! it was fearful! and what those Nunneries I have seen contain, from what I know of them, I believe these contain. Lay their walls bare-level them with the earth they pollute. And when this is done, if you pronounce them guiltless of crime, then wo to Columbia, for she is dishonored!"</p> 
               <p>"Down with the Nunnery"! "Riddle their polluted walls!" "Why should we have institutions among us hid within a fortress, as if they feared the light of day?" now resounded from that angry crowd which heaved and rocked with aroused passions.</p> 
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5770-00000114"/> 
               <p>"To the Nunnery! You know the way, and I will be by your side!" shouted Gaven, and forcing his way with Steinmitz and Paul through the crowd, he called loudly to the people to follow. The mass of living beings, rocked and tossed like the waves of the sea, rolled onward and soon surrounded the Nunnery they had doomed to destruction.</p> 
               <p>"Within these, or the Church's walls adjoining, either dead or alive-and I pray God she be dead-I believe is immured my foster-sister, and the affianced bride of our martyred Shiffler. What say you? Shall we bring her forth?'</p> 
               <p>"How can you ask?" said Gaven. "If alive, she is suffering torture which each day is a death in itself."</p> 
               <p>A yell of rage, long, loud, and fierce, accompanied by a vigorous attack upon its walls, was the response of the people who, in a moment more, fell back in dismay before a perfect shower of bullets poured upon them from the Nunnery grounds. Several of their number were borne dead or dying away, while the rest retreated before the death-dealing hail. The storm had lulled. The Republicans saw, with heartfelt gratitude, this favorable aspect, and made every effort to induce the excited people to return to their homes, and trust to the wisdom of their laws for protection. It was of no avail. Their appeals were received in sullen silence and terrific groans alternately, until exhausted with their efforts, the Republican<pb n=""/> leaders, with sorrow, left the ground. The people were constantly augmented by new accessions; but their flashing eyes and the stern, compressed lips, told plainer than words that, the lull would be of short duration. Sheriff M'MICHAEL, with his posse, now mingled freely with the people, and by his firmness partially allayed the fierce passions that called so loudly for vengeance.</p> 
               <p>The hours passed away, and darkness dispersed the timid, while those more resolute retired only on the morrow to return with concentrated force. Paul, in company with Gaven, sought the humble home of the stricken widow-the mother of SHIFFLER. As they drew near the wail of grief that could not be assuaged broke on their ears.</p> 
               <p>"I was alone!" came in broken accents from her over burthened heart, "and he-my first born-my noble boy-was my only stay! And now they have murdered him! Oh, God! what have I done to them that this affliction should fall upon me? That this, my son, should be denied the right to live!"</p> 
               <p>"Peace, mother, your son is not murdered, but martyred! His spirit lives no longer here, but has returned to the God who gave it. He can never die! and, in ages to come, his memory will be cherished and embalmed in the hearts of the rising generations, when we all shall have passed away and are forgotten. The name of Shiffler will hereafter be a rallying cry when oppression, with its loathsome tread, would hurl from its proud height our Nation's flag<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5770-00000115"/> Then we will remember that he died still holding it aloft, that we might look upon freedom's folds and be strong!"</p> 
               <p>Pale and cold he lay in the calm sleep of death. "Irene! Mother! Heaven!" seemed still to linger on his lips, now white as the shroud with which they were preparing to enfold him; but who a few hours before had uttered words laden with life and hope. All, all had now fled. Paul's heart grew stern and vindictive as he looked upon the still form of him for whom he had relinquished the beautiful lost Irene, and from its depth he cursed the hands that had dealt the blows which deprived him of a sister and friend. More than friend-for he loved Shiffler as a connecting link between himself and Irene. She had loved him, and he felt drawn towards him as a memento of the pure love he bore to her. Silently he went forth from the house of death with Gaven, and soon learned how fatal had been the assault upon them.</p> 
               <p>"Wesley Rhinedollar is dead! and George Young is dying!" said one of his companions who formed part of a group around the stricken mother's door.</p> 
               <p>"My God! where will this end?"</p> 
               <p>"This is not all! William Hillman, Mathew Hammitt, and Lewis Greble are dead! And the end is not yet; others are mortally wounded and cannot live!"</p> 
               <p>A cold shudder ran through the group.</p> 
               <p>"How long, Americans," said Gaven with scorn, "will you bear this yoke? I am told you have had every specie<pb n=""/> of insult heaped upon you; and now, as a crowning act, your citizens are shot down while lawfully, peacefully performing a duty imperatively demanded of them?"</p> 
               <p>"No longer! we have already borne too much!" answered the group in low, quiet, stern tones.</p> 
               <p>"That is well;" said Gaven, "assemble armed tomorrow, on the ground where Shiffler gave up his life, and a fearful reckoning shall be in store for them. This outbreak has been deliberately planned; else why were men occupying a single room and clothed in rags, in possession of valuable new rifles, such as we saw them have to-day? They broke up your meeting on Friday last with the intention of forcing you into a combat, and when they found themselves foiled, hit upon the project of driving carts loaded with dirt through the assembly to-day, hoping to accomplish by such an insult their purpose. Foiled in this, they have attacked you without provocation! Fore-bearance now ceases to be a virtue. If you will not fight for your homes, the city will within a week, be clothed in sackcloth and ashes. I speak thus strongly," continued Gaven, "because I know the enemies with whom you have to deal."</p>

               <argument> 
                  <p>The people still unappeased-Military reinforcements-Sheriff M'Michael tries to restore order-St. Michael's set on fire-Duplicity of the Confessor-Paul and Gaven threaten to throw him in the flames, unless he reveals the whereabouts of Irene-He tells them she was in St. Augustine's-They repair to that Church-Interview with the Curate-He denies any knowledge of her-The crowd surrounds the Church-Their increasing excitement-The building fired-The Arch-Bishop looks on complacently from an adjoining building-He appears gratified at the result-Conversation between himself, the Confessor, and Priest-Terrible commotion and disorder.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>THE early dawn of the seventh of May arose on the city, already alive with the people who silently and sternly pursued their way towards the scene of slaughter the day before. They were now heavily armed, and in the calmness of their purpose lay the element most to be feared. The crowd hourly augmented, and by noon every street that led to the scene of carnage was blocked up by the people, whose purpose flashed from their eyes and was read in their scowling brows. In vain Sheriff M'Michael besought them to disperse. The were alike deaf to his threats and entreaties; and in the extremity, to save further bloodshed, he sought aid from General Cadwalader. This was refused, and he returned once more to his post, and again endeavored to sway the rising tempest.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The people crowded closer, still closer around the doomed buildings from which the deadly fire had been poured upon their unprotected, unarmed ranks, and in a moment after flames from a dozen places burst simultaneously forth, and as they with their fiery tongues licked up every combustible material, they wreathed and curled upwards. The people fell back with shouts of triumph from the Market House, and in a moment more this structure was also enveloped in flames. General Cadwalader no longer refused his assistance for the protection of property, and at the head of his Brigade, forced his way through the people, who parted right and left to allow him to surround the conflagration. Fiercer and fiercer it grew, gathering strength in its course, until wave after wave of fire rolled up to heaven; but in the eyes of the people, the scene was a burnt offering to the manes of their murdered brothers. Silently they watched the buildings crumbling into ashes, and then a sigh of relief burst from their hearts.</p> 
               <p>"Would to Heaven that had been St. Michael's and the Nunnery," shouted Paul. "Then I should know, when I saw them in ashes, that Irene was no longer there!"</p> 
               <p>"Ho! for St. Michael's!" cried several of his companions; and the cry being taken up by the citizens, as if the same thought had been in many a heart, they broke away for the point at which it stood.</p> 
               <p>"For mercy's sake, Gaven, don't let them burn it now!"<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5770-00000117"/> exclaimed Paul eagerly. "She may be alive there, and perish in its flames!"</p> 
               <p>"She was a beautiful young girl when she disappeared, was she not, my friend?" asked Gaven calmly.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly-why do you ask?"</p> 
               <p>"Think you, then, if she has been a prisoner these many months, and in the power of men who know not the name of mercy, she would not welcome death, even by fire, so that it released her from their hands?"</p> 
               <p>"This is more than I can bear!" exclaimed Paul in agony. "Lead on!-but do not ask me to ply the torch! Spare me that!"</p> 
               <p>Their object was, however, anticipated by the Military, and the people retreated; but that fearful sterness still sat on their brows, and in it those who read them rightly saw they retreated only for a season. The practised eyes of Gen. Cadwalader read in the threatening looks the danger that menaced the Nunnery, and ordered out the Monroe Guards, commanded by Captain Wm. F. Small; the Jackson Artillerists, Captain Hubbell; the National Guards, Captain Tustin, for its protection. Throughout the day the people contented themselves with threats of vengeance, but they made no demonstrations to carry them into execution. They missed the daring, master spirits, that had led them on to the destruction of the Hose House, adjoining buildings and Market House the evening before. (See Note 66.)</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"We must distract the attention of the Military, or we shall never accomplish our object," said Gaven who, with Paul and Steinmitz, had in vain endeavored to penetrate the mass of human beings that surrounded the Nunnery.</p> 
               <p>Paul shuddered, and at the moment was glad in his heart they were like to fail. It was soon over, however, and with compressed lips he looked at the matches he carried, and when he saw them, smiled triumphantly that he had overcome his momentary weakness.</p> 
               <p>"Here is a row of empty frame buildings, fire them, and the military will surround them and leave the Nunnery," said one of the group who was near them.</p> 
               <p>"No, no," said Steinmitz. "Do not punish the innocent with the guilty. God knows we do not wish to exterminate, but only to vindicate our right to live, think and act unmolested!"</p> 
               <p>"With you, that may be all," cried Paul, "blood is not unatoned between you and them, but it is between them and me. Irene's and Shiffler's cry for vengeance! Shall I hesitate and leave them to deeper crimes?"</p> 
               <p>"'Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,'" said one of the Republican leaders, who, with several others had come again on their mission of mercy to pacify the excited people.</p> 
               <p>A scornful reply arose to the lips of Gaven, but it died on his lips; for high above their heads curled vast volumes of smoke, and in a moment after the lurid flames burst<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5770-00000118"/> from the row of frames, crackled and wreathed upwards. The people hailed it with shouts of applause, and pressed around the conflagration. The troops forced their way through the crowd, and surrounded the destroying element, leaving a free egress to the walls of the Nunnery, which were scaled by those intent on its destruction who, forcing their way through, fired it, the parsonage, and the Church of St. Michael's. While in this act Paul saw the Confessor skulking about the grounds, evidently watching an opportunity to escape. With a bound he sprang forward, and dragging him from his retreat, as he pointed to the buildings whence smoke was already issuing, cried-</p> 
               <p>"Tell me the truth, or I will hurl you into the rising flames yonder. Is Irene dead or alive in any of these buildings?"</p> 
               <p>"Off, you accursed heretic! How dare you ask me such a question?"</p> 
               <p>"To the flames with him! Throw him in!" shouted Gaven, and seizing the Confessor by the other arm, they dragged him within a few feet of the parsonage, the first story of which was one vast sheet of flame.</p> 
               <p>"Mercy! mercy!" cried the trembling culprit, his lips livid with fright and passion.</p> 
               <p>"You ask for mercy?" returned Paul, scornfully. "I will give the mercy you gave your victim, unless you tell me truly if Irene is, or is not in these buildings! Speak! or I will throw you in!" he continued, as he<pb n=""/> saw the flames gathering strength, and raising higher and higher.</p> 
               <p>"No! no! she is not!" he answered, half dead with affright.</p> 
               <p>"Then, where is she?" demanded Paul.</p> 
               <p>"I know not. Let me go, and I will pardon your sins free of charge, and restore you to the bosom of the Church!"</p> 
               <p>"Throw in the hypocrite!-Throw him in!" cried Gaven, and he raised him, as if he was anxious to perform the deed.</p> 
               <p>"Stop! stop!" begged the culprit, "she is in St. Augustine's,-now let me go!"</p> 
               <p>"Thou liest, base recreant!" cried Paul, "the Curate of St. Augustine's would never detain her against her will!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, she is there-I sent her there last night for protection. She is safe. I swear it by the Mother of God! Now let me go in peace!"</p> 
               <p>"Go!" said Paul, as he hurled the wretch from him, as if he had been a viper; "but beware, if you have deceived me!"</p> 
               <p>At liberty once more, the Confessor invoked the protection of the military, who escorted him to a carriage in which he was rapidly driven to a place of security. The flames now enveloped the burning buildings in one vast sheet. On, on they rolled up to Heaven amid shouts of<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5770-00000119"/> triumph. The clear shrill notes of the fife and drum as they touched the notes of "Boyne Water," arose high above the shouts of the people, the curses of the vanquished foes, and the crackling of the flames. The vast sea of human beings around mocked alike the commands and threats of the military. The troops under Col. Page were ordered to drive them back, and disperse them at the point of the bayonet, and in a moment a glittering array of steel was levelled by them at the breasts of their brothers. This enraged the people who, advancing with flashing eyes and unfaltering steps, defied them to execute the command. (See Note 67.)</p> 
               <p>The American is the same the world over. He is jealous of his honor, and fears to take offence hastily, lest he compromises it, and will bear in silence until forbearance ceases to be a virtue; then he will turn and avenge himself, fearing, caring for no danger in the course he pursues to wipe out the stain. So it was then. The people had borne aggressions in silence for years; but they had turned upon their aggressors and laughed at the glittering steel that opposed them. Col. Page saw the error in his command, and placing himself between his troops and the people, appealed to them as Americans, as citizens, to disperse in peace. With three cheers for him and his troops who had but a few moments before levelled naked bayonets at their breasts, they dispersed.</p> 
               <p>General Cadwalader and Sheriff M'Michael congratulated<pb n=""/> lated themselves that the storm had passed, and hoped soon to restore the city to its usual quiet. But rumors that citizens had been shot down, while peacefully walking the streets, with threats of further assaults, and bands of armed ruffians who paraded the streets daring the citizens to combat were rife. These would, however, have been silenced by the civil power, had there been no leaders to urge on the people to resist them. Such leaders had been furnished by their enemies from their own ranks who, having been galled by persecution into madness, strove to avenge at once their own and their country's wrongs.</p> 
               <p>Paul, on releasing the Confessor, hastened towards St. Augustine's. Already it was surrounded by a crowd whose threatening aspect indicated their purpose.</p> 
               <p>"We will not have armed citadels within our city," they cried. "Disperse the men within it, and deliver up your arms, or we will burn it to the ground!"</p> 
               <p>Paul forced his way through the crowd, and in defiance of their threats to fire, boldly advanced to the Parsonage and demanded to see the Curate, who came forward and wished to know his business.</p> 
               <p>"To regain possession of Irene Freeman," he answered, "who, but a few moments ago, I was informed by the Confessor, was sent here last evening!"</p> 
               <p>"There is not a woman about these premises," returned the Curate calmly. "The Nuns sent here last evening<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5770-00000120"/> were taken this morning to a better place of security, I was told, but I know not where."</p> 
               <p>"Was she among them?" eagerly asked Paul.</p> 
               <p>"I know not-they came and went veiled; I saw not one without the veil, nor even spoke with one."</p> 
               <p>"Down with the Church, and make sure of it, as we did with St. Michael's!" cried Gaven, who had accompanied him hither.</p> 
               <p>"Nay, that would only heap crime upon crime, and injury upon injury," returned the Curate gently.</p> 
               <p>"Have <emph>we,</emph> then, no injuries to avenge? Why have you not practised what you preach?"</p> 
               <p>"You ought to be the last one to put that question, Gaven!"</p> 
               <p>"Ha! you know me, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly. You are Gaven, 'The Renegade.'"</p> 
               <p>"Say rather Gaven, the Avenger!" he cried scornfully as he turned away.</p> 
               <p>"You," said the Curate, turning to Paul who stood irresolute, "ought to know me better than to believe I would detain any one, or countenance such an outrage. If others have, surely you will not visit the crimes of the guilty on the innocent!"</p> 
               <p>"I have seen confidence so often abused that I know not whom to believe or trust," returned Paul; and he added bitterly, "I have begun, and believe her alive, and I will lead the people to the destruction of every Church<pb n=""/> and Nunnery in the State, but that I will find her. They only await leaders, and then wo to those who oppose them!"</p> 
               <p>"Paul Gordon! have you come to this?" demanded the Curate, in sad, earnest tones.</p> 
               <p>"No! I have been driven to it! and by those who should have shielded their flock instead of themselves devouring the fairest of them without mercy!" and, turning, he left the Curate and followed Gaven from the premises. They again rejoined the people, when their failure to obtain information of Irene was communicated to their companions who had, from her first abduction sympathized with him and the martyred Shiffler.</p> 
               <p>The hours passed. St. Michael's and the Nunnery were one blackened heap of ruins. Now the cry "To St. Augustine's," that had been soft and low, grew louder and fiercer, until it went up in shouts that rent the air, and caused their enemies to quake with fear. On they pressed, those solid ranks of avengers, urged by Gaven, whose voice was loudest and fiercest in threats of destruction. Gradually they surrounded the massive structure high above which towered the gilded Cross. The First City Troop had been sent to protect this Church, but they were inadequate to stem the human tide that pressed upon their ranks. Even the deadly missiles poured from the Church and grounds around, never made them falter. The time had passed when Shiffler fell, with his nation's flag around<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5770-00000121"/> him, for them to falter, and their foes, by the course they were pursuing, only hastened their own defeat.</p> 
               <p>The military now filed away and took up their position in the streets leading to St. Mary's and St. John's, to prevent the people surrounding those churches, and abandoned St. Augustine's to its fate, from whose vestibule even then arose the crackling flames. Higher and higher they continued to rise, while the people shouted a wild mad requiem to the check aggression had driven them to give to superstitious intolerance. In that hour the foes of the Republic, as they saw their fairest churches enveloped in flames, saw they had underestimated the inborn virtues of the people. Hatred of the truth, and the intelligence which pervaded all classes, and with its searching rays laid bare their own dark designs, had blinded them to the uncompromising virtues which these people had received in all their original purity, from their Puritan fathers. They had thought these had died out in the lapse of ages, or had been so amalgamated with the effeminate luxuriousness of the old world, as to render them harmless or nugatory. Now that their vindictive passions were aroused, they trembled before them. They saw them throwing off all restraint, fearfully avenging their own wrongs, treating alike with contempt all civil and military law.</p> 
               <p>With fearful forebodings they saw the majestic pile of St. Augustine's enveloped in the sweeping flames, her<pb n=""/> strong walls bending and swaying in the firey furnace, her cupola wreathed in its lurid mantle; then, down! down to the earth it fell! cracking as if ashamed of the mockery of which it was a symbol-the gilded Cross. With it fell a mantle of humiliation on the pure hearted Catholics who, with saddened feelings looked upon it. On those of the Arch-Bishop, Confessor and Priest, it brought a far different sensation.</p> 
               <p>"We have not acted with sufficient energy in the beginning of the fray, and it is too late now to remedy the error, while this fierce storm is raging," remarked the Arch-Bishop, as he with calmness, stood in a dwelling near by overlooking the devouring flames.</p> 
               <p>"Had not our Catholics been recreant to their orders, the streets before this, would have been deluged in blood! Half the muskets and rifles distributed among them they suffered to be wrested undischarged, by their assailants, from their hands."</p> 
               <p>"In truth," said the Priest, "I believe not half of them know how to fire or load a gun. It would have been a better policy to have armed them with shillalahs, and led them on to attack the meeting in the first place, than to have trusted to the rifles. In that case we should have won and retained the field. As it is, it is too late to attempt it now, while the feeling is so strong and general against us."</p> 
               <p>"There will soon be a reaction, and in the lull we can<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5770-00000122"/> turn even the destruction of our property to our advantage," returned the Arch-Bishop complacently. "Some of our property destroyed was old, and the rest not as imposing and striking as it should have been. It answered our purpose years ago, before the idea was seriously broached of concentrating the Throne of the Apostles in America. Now that there is a certainty of accomplishing this within a short period, we owe it to ourselves to throw around our worship every fascination ingenuity can devise, to lure the weak understanding by a captivating exterior, and the rich and fastidious tastes by gorgeous structures and harmonious appointments. We shall lose nothing by the flames; the City will be forced to indemnify us for every dollar destroyed, and by judicious appraisements we can get paid far more than their value."</p> 
               <p>"They may, like the heretics of Boston, refuse to indemnify us for the loss. The Ursuline Convent burnt there, is still unpaid for."</p> 
               <p>"The recklessness of the Ursulines called down upon themselves the destruction, and their acts were too public for investigation in order to obtain indemnity. I trust you have been more cautious here. What transpires in connection with the Church should never be known to the heretics."</p> 
               <p>"The Confessor was too bungling in that Irene Freman affair," remarked the Priest, and then, as ill luck would have it, the young man to whom she was betrothed,<pb n=""/> was the SHIFFLER who was shot! This has served to exasperate the people!"</p> 
               <p>The Confessor turned pale. The lurid flames of his Church which he had barely escaped by acknowledging the truth of his knowledge of her to Paul, were before him, and then the threat of Paul, should he have deceived him! With a choking sensation he retorted-</p> 
               <p>"I have done nothing which I was not authorized to do by the canons of our Church, and these I have performed to the best of my ability. Can you say the same?"</p> 
               <p>"In truth, I can," angrily returned the Priest.</p> 
               <p>"Then your charge and you tell different tales," returned the Confessor with much asperity.</p> 
               <p>"Stop! Let me have none of your bickerings!" returned the Arch-Bishop authoritatively. The Confessor and Priest awed by the reproof were silent, and the three in unity resumed their schemes.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>A resume-Irene's abduction-The Confessor's unholy demeanor-He visits Irene's cell for the purpose of removing her to another place-She hesitates but finally goes with the other Nuns-Her joy at breathing the fresh air-She conceals herself in the yard of St. Augustine's-Her ultimate escape-She encounters the crowd, and falls helpless to the ground-Gaven picks her up and conveys her to Mr. Connelly's residence-She is lifeless-Mrs. Connelly recognizes her-Affecting domestic scene-Exciting circumstances-Paul's anguish at the sight of Irene.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>FOR months after Irene Freeman had been abducted, she had been like one in delirium. She chafed against her prison bars like a caged bird; and when the only human being she saw in these long months, the Confessor, visited her, she raved at his hated presence like a maniac; and in her rage often attempted his life, until he found it necessary to practise great caution while in her presence. Her inborn delicacy and refinement were too much for his gross sensuality; and at last he cursed the beauty and loveliness of his victim who tempted, then foiled him. From the once gentle, shrinking being, she had become fierce as a tigress at bay. He had used force, flattery, and even had knelt at her feet, and like Satan on the Mount, had offered honors and wealth if she would yield herself a victim at the shrine still reeking with the innocence of the last victim<pb n=""/> tim immolated on its polluted altar! When all these failed, he carried drugged wine to her, and from the long, death-like slumber which succeeded she awoke broken hearted. Now she no longer chafed at her prison bars, but daily, hourly prayed for the death that came not, but which she would have embraced, with gladness, as the only ray of hope that she looked for with calmness. She saw her captor less often, until at last he had ceased to inflict his loathsome presence on her. He had her removed to a room less prison-like, still it held her securely within its walls. Perchance he had found another for whom he required the silence of that underground cell, whence no cry of despair could reach the world above, and where the stern eye of justice could not penetrate, until the captive should cease to wish for life, and finally seek that peace in the tomb, or in resignation to her cruel fate denied her by her persecutors. From her cell Irene heard the shouts of the people without, and saw the fierce flames roll up to heaven, when the first conflagration occurred. She knew not its meaning and seemed not to heed its avenging flames. She heard also the gathering throng surround the building in which she was confined, but it came to her like a knell; and had the prison bars been then unloosed would have herself rebarred them, rather than to have gone forth to feel the finger of derision and scorn pointed at her. She no longer wished to even go forth again to the light of day. The agony she had first felt in<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5770-00000124"/> her separation from her Uncle and Aunt, Paul and SHIFFLER! had died away into an agony, at the thought of again meeting them. She knew the rigid virtues of her Uncle and Aunt, and the uncompromising ideas of delicacy which were inherent in Paul's nature. How then could she meet them again? Nay, rather than brave the trial, she would have made herself a murderer, and taken from herself the life her God had given her.</p> 
               <p>For months she had not allowed her heart to dwell upon the choice of her innocent girlhood; but the memory of SHIFFLER had been religiously discarded from it.</p> 
               <p>"His life is marred, but his name shall never in memory be polluted, by resting in my heart!" she had often said to herself, when she remembered his earnest devotion. Alas! she knew not that, even then, they would with open arms have gladly welcomed her, and bade her sorrow no more!</p> 
               <p>Louder and fiercer without the shouts arose, and when twilight had thrown its mantle over the earth, the Confessor came to her prison bearing the black serge dress of a nun, in which he bade her robe herself. Scornfully she threw it aside trampling on its hated folds.</p> 
               <p>"Irene, this is no time for delay! This building will be fired in less than an hour by the accursed heretics! And if you do not wish to perish in its flames, put on the dress to facilitate your escape!"</p> 
               <p>"Thank God that they have at last resolved to destroy<pb n=""/> this nest of pollution!" cried Irene. "I have often warned you it would come to this."</p> 
               <p>'This is no time for recrimination. The Catholics have brought it on themselves by their resistance of the commands of the Church. Had they obeyed in silence, and trusted implicitly to her, all would have been well!"</p> 
               <p>"You mean, if they had suffered themselves to be robbed, slandered, their wives and daughters insulted, or dragged away to dens like this, as I have been, all would have been well!"</p> 
               <p>"You deserve to perish in the flames for your obstinacy! And I would leave you to a just fate, if I had not some affection for you, in spite of your contumacy! There are those who would look upon you with envy! I am not scorned by all as by you, proud girl! I shall return for you in a few minutes, and if you are not ready for flight then, remember your awful death will be on your own head!"</p> 
               <p>When alone, Irene's heart was torn by contending emotions. Why should she escape from death to prolong a life of misery? Had she not often prayed for death? Then she thought of the lingering death in the crackling flames; and enveloping herself in the habiliments of a nun, she went forth with the Confessor when he came back for her, and guarded, was conveyed with the rest of the nuns, many of those wretched as herself, to St. Augustine's. Here she remained until morning; but rumors that<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5770-00000125"/> this retreat would also share the fate of St. Michael's were current, and they were again commanded to prepare for a second flight. They were all marshaled into the grounds preparatory to departing. The shrubbery was clothed in its young summer leaves and flowers, while the ground was tufted with its new rich carpet of verdure. It had been months since she had seen a leaf or flower, or placed her foot upon the green earth, or inhaled the fresh pure air.</p> 
               <p>Never before had they looked so beautiful to her, or been enjoyed with such delicious overpowering sensations. They infused new life and vigor in her soul, and then for the first time in many months, she longed for freedom. Why should she remain? No dungeon enclosed her-the free air of heaven was about her. She thought not at that moment of shame, nor disgrace. She had detached herself from the rest of the nuns, and watching her opportunity, she glided away unseen among the thick shrubbery, and cowering among a clump of roses lay hidden, unheeded by them in the general consternation which prevailed which had facilitated her escape from her companions. Long she lay there, her black serge dress aiding her concealment. The Confessor, with his convoy of nuns, had long since left the grounds. Now was her time to get away-if ever. Throwing off the despised robe, which had been worn over her own clothes, she emerged from her covering, but had not made her way ten paces before<pb n=""/> she observed the hated Confessor in conversation with the Curate. She saw at a glance that they had not seen her, and gliding back to her hiding place, concealed herself again among the roses, whose fair budding blossoms typified her own girlhood budding in beauty, beneath which glittered sharp piercing thorns!</p> 
               <p>The day wore away, and still they lingered, while from the street around arose the loud fierce imprecations of the people. She could not see them, but she knew their numbers constantly augmented. High above their yells arose the voice of Mayor SCOTT, who was endeavoring to calm their anger and turn them from their purpose. She heard all and knew the danger that menaced even her, in this retreat, was imminent; for the grounds were rapidly filling as the people pressed closer around the building they had doomed to destruction, trampling down alike the groves and the flowers.</p> 
               <p>Her heart now quaked with fear. She dreaded alike to fall into the hands of the Confessor, or the people. Poor hunted girl! she knew not that had she appealed to any one of those assembled there for protection, at once a thousand arms would have been so many shields about her to protect her from injury. (See Note 68.)</p> 
               <p>The Church was fired, and, as the red flames curled upwards, and not till then, did she venture forth. Like a hunted hare, she ran from cover to cover, her black serge dress still shielding her from observation. The glare of<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5770-00000126"/> the flames now lit up every portion of the grounds and the streets around. Whither should she fly? Should she remain where already she felt the intense heat of the rising flames, a mark for every curious eye? or brave the solid columns of human beings around? She shrank alike from either. Fiercer grew the heat, and the burning cinders began to fall thick and fast around her. The air grew heated and suffocating, while the leaves of the shrubbery around her trembled and shriveled in the intense heat of the roaring element. (See Note 69.)</p> 
               <p>Half distracted she resolved to brave the crowd, and darting forth, had already reached a few feet beyond the open gate, when the solid array of upturned faces, lit up by the conflagration, struck terror into her already over-burthened heart, and with a wild cry she sank unconscious to the ground. But scarcely had she fallen, when a dozen stout arms were ready to raise her, when they were pushed authoritatively aside by Gaven, who tenderly bore her from the scene, the people stepping aside to let him pass.</p> 
               <p>"These Priests have an eye for beauty;" laughed one brutal fellow, as his eye rested on the passive, pallid face of the unconscious girl</p> 
               <p>"Aye-that they have!" returned another.</p> 
               <p>Gaven drew the veil attached to the dress over her face, and hurried along as fast as his burthen could be borne through the wedged masses of humanity. A suspicion had flashed across his mind, that she he bore was the<pb n=""/> foster sister of Paul, for whom, in the brief space that he had known him, he had formed a strong friendship. Misfortunes draw out the passions, and like misfortunes often produce friendships, united by links that time brightens as it adds to the memory of the past.</p> 
               <p>The crowd was passed, and he with the still unconscious girl stood in the unincumbered street. Instinctively he took his course now towards Mr. Connelly's residence, and entering abruptly, laid her at the feet of Mrs. Connelly, and exhausted leaned against the mantle to recover his breath, as he imperiously directed attention to the motionless form at his feet.</p> 
               <p>Bending over and drawning aside the veil that hid the face of the woman before her, Mrs. Connelly, with a cry of joy and astonishment, raised the fair young head and pressing it to her bosom, cried-</p> 
               <p>"Thank God! we have recovered our Irene, at last!" Then as she saw how still and cold she lay, she continued-</p> 
               <p>"Irene! awake! and look upon me! How still and cold you are; rouse thee, Irene! and cheer the hearth your loss desolated! Irene! Irene! look up! We have waited and prayed long for you! She does not answer-she does not hear me! Oh, God! in mercy spare us our Irene!" She then added, "The heavens are closed upon us-they no longer hear our prayers-and have returned us only the cold, inanimate form of her we loved, while it has robbed us of its life!"</p> 
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5770-00000127"/> 
               <p>Gaven knelt beside her-the spirit had been released from its sufferings-she was, indeed, dead! The tortured soul had returned to the God who gave it; and the blood of <emph>one more victim</emph> arose from earth to Heaven, crying for vengeance, while back from Heaven to earth came the ominous voice-"Vengeance is mine, and I will repay saith the Lord!"</p> 
               <p>They raised her up, and bore her to her own couch, and laid her where she had so often slept the sleep of youth and innocence. Mrs. Connelly tore away from her the garb of hypocrisy, and with a cry of horror, shrunk from the rigid clay before her.</p> 
               <p>"Spare me! oh, Father! why hast Thou reserved this wo for me?" she cried, as she turned to flee from the chamber of death</p> 
               <p>"Thanks to a merciful Heaven that her spirit has fled!" returned Mr. Connelly, who had entered the house, as they bore her to her chamber, and had followed them thither in time to comprehend the misery from which that heart broken being had escaped, in passing from earth to her Maker.</p> 
               <p>Paul came as the hours passed, and when he had heard the tale of her rescue and flight, he for hours paced his chamber, and then went to the couch of death, to look upon all that remained of her he had so loved-and lost. As he stood looking down upon that pallid face, he read in the sunken eye, hollow cheek and delicately transparent hand,<pb n=""/> how she had suffered. Not a tear dimmed his eye; not a tremor crossed his lips; but every feature grew rigid and pale, while his form dilated, and his hands became compressed, until the fingers were buried in the flesh, as he strode firmly, deliberately from the room. He knew she had never sinned, unless from compulsion, and he formed a stern purpose in his heart to hold the guilty responsible for the fiendish deed. Gaven led him to his own chamber where, until long after dawn, he sat in his chair rigid and cold; but with the fires of intense hatred and anger, scorching his very soul.</p> 
               <p>Exhausted nature demanded repose, and throwing himself on his bed, he slept a long troubled sleep. The stillness, and solemnity of the grave lay upon that desecrated household. They closed their doors against the intrusion of the sympathizing or curious, who learned only that Irene had returned and died the hour of her arrival. The hands of her Aunt shrouded her for her long last repose, for she shrank from seeing the smile of derisive scorn on the lips of strangers, as they looked coldly, inquisitively, on her lifeless form.</p> 
               <p>With lips compressed to still the wild agony of her heart, she accomplished her pious task, conscious that she had saved the name of one she had so loved and mourned, from the profanation and unfeeling taunts of the heartless world. She knew not all she had suffered, nor of the despair that had fed on the life blood of her heart, nor even where<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5770-00000128"/> these long months of misery had been dragged out, nor from whose hand the terrible blow had fallen, although she rightly guessed. Had she known, she would have shrunk from ferreting out the fiend, as in that case, it could not restore to life and purity the cold clay before her, and would tarnish the fair name which she was endeavoring with religious zeal to preserve, as all that was now left to the world of the early dead.</p> 
               <p>In vain Justice demanded the sacrifice of an inquest that the guilty might be punished; but, sternly, she bade it begone, and with her hand on her heart to still its wild throbbings, she took up her solitary watch by the beautiful dead, while the solemn, measured tread of her husband in the adjoining room, never ceased.</p> 
               <p>Paul never again looked on that cold beautiful face; and on the morning when the bells pealed forth their sad wailing notes of sorrow for the burial of SHIFFLER, they lowered his betrothed to her last home, and as the solemn words "Earth to earth, and dust to dust" died away, Paul and Gaven turned aside, and joined the throng of mourners that was hurrying on to the widow's home who could, in the desolation of her heart, mourn for her martyred son, with the proud thought that he had fallen in the discharge of a duty every free-born son of America owed the land of his birth, and with his country's flag he had held aloft folded around him, he had fallen to rise no more. (See Note 70.)</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The people in vast numbers now crowded around the house of mourning. They were bowed in sorrow, and the stern features that so late had breathed nothing but vengeance, now expressed grief for one of their number, at the dawn of manhood, and who had been robbed of his betrothed, and when he turned to his country to plead his wrongs, had in the act been stricken down! Has it come to this, then? Shall we, the free-born sons of America, bear aggression and taunting insults, not daring to turn on the serf-born sons of despotism, whom we have taken from the Old World to our homes and hearts, and in our generosity made equals with ourselves, for fear their old masters, to whose mandates they still bow, should cry out "You are intolerant!" (See Note 71.)</p> 
               <p>What caused the stern old Puritans to leave the land of their birth, and the groves of their ancestors, for the unknown, untried wilds of a savage shore? It was because they were there denied the right to worship God, think and act as their hearts' dictated, and were robbed of their all to support a wicked, despotic system, which placed one-third of their brothers and sisters in magnificent abodes, where they revelled in vice and luxury, while the other two-thirds, born with the same spiritual aspirations and passions, were burthened and starved, that this dead weight, this monstrous Juggernaut might roll on each year in renewed splendor, its inmates never heeding, though it rolled in a sea of human blood, and<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5770-00000129"/> up by the expiring breath of myriads of their brothers whose souls, as they ascended to God, illumined the air with a halo of divine light, while the tortured body was cast unheeded by. (See Note 72.)</p> 
               <p>This dead weight; this Papist Juggernaut, had gnawed at the vitals of the Old World, until it was at last bankrupt alike in morals and treasure, and became so rotten that even this vampire, so loathsome in itself, turned disgusted from its banquet, and with longing eyes looked to the vigorous, hale Giant of the New World. With her foul train of lazaroni, with their shaven heads and cringing, effeminate hypocrisy, that shamed alike their manhood and humanity, followed by those whom they, by force or stratagem; or because they had debased the image of the Creator in the soul within, until it fell by its own impurities, they sped to the New World, and fastening upon the young Giant, began gnawing their way into his vitals. (See Note 73.)</p> 
               <p>Proud of his vigor and might, he laughed at the warnings of those who had watched the last labored throes for vitality in the Old World, nor until he felt that his own existence was being sapped; that a plague was rankling near his heart akin to that which had desolated Europe, did he attempt to shake off the vampire which, like an incubus, was slowly, surely fastening on his waning virtues and wealth. His first attempt was met with imprecations and fresh insults; his next, the flag that he had taught<pb n=""/> every nation on the earth to respect, was torn and trampled upon; and his third, by the martyrdom of young Shiffler, who chose death rather than to fly and see his colors fall into the sacriligious hands of his foes!</p> 
               <p>Now they were following him to his last repose! The coffin was shrouded with the flag he had died to save from desecration, and which he had relinquished only with life! On the right of the coffin was borne, by one of his fellow members, the flag of the pleasure yacht, Amanda Frances. Then followed the Committee of Four, appointed to lead the procession, consisting of Colonel Childs, John D. Fox, William Bethel and E. D. Tarr. Solemnly the escort moved along towards the Cemetery at Hanover and Duke streets, followed by the bereaved mother and her little ones who had, in losing a brother, lost one they had in their orphanage learned to look up to for aid. Then came the vast concourse of mourners, for every American heart bled when the young patriot fell. Others had fallen also, but they fell to avenge the outrage that struck him down; and, whenever the name of Shiffler is heard, the heart involuntarily does homage to his avengers. He led the way, and showed them how patriots die, while they taught his murderers how a slaughtered patriot could be avenged! (See Note 74.)</p> 
               <p>They lowered him to his long repose, and as the words in solemn tones arose-"I am the Resurrection and the Life!" did not the sound appal the hearts of his foes?<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5770-00000130"/> Did they not think perchance the name of Shiffler might speak from the grave, and with its potent sound, call up myriads to complete the work he had so well began? "Earth to earth!" the grave closed over him, and we shall see him no more! He is gone, he is dead! No, he is not dead! Shiffler can never die! He still lives in the heart of every Republican and in his country's history, a beacon to light and lead them to victory.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>The people feel the necessity of Leaders-They were not yet subdued-The organization of Ward Associations-Formation of the American Republican Party-They petition Congress for the Enactment of Salutary Laws-Their request refused-They find Jesuits at the Heads of Departments-Roman influence at the Ballot-Box-Powerless effects of the St. Leopold Order in Philadelphia-The Arch-Bishop's schemes thwarted-He plans new arrangements-The American Association of Naturalized Irishmen formed-Pat Mullin their President-Conversation between the Arch-Bishop, the Confessor, and the Curate-The people intractable-Recommendations for libel suits-The Curate's dissatisfaction-The Arch-Bishop's anger and resolutions.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>THE people missed the leaders that had led them to the morning's conflagration, and though they manifested little inclination of being appeased, yet they wandered about in parties, each one looking to his brother for the word of command which came not, until they finally broke up, and peace once more lay over the distracted city. Had not these leaders been bowed with grief, Heaven only knows what would have been the result, as it only needed cool determined men to lead them on, to have insured the destruction of every Catholic Church and Nunnery in the city and county. The military and city authorities, as well as the Republicans, supposed they were awed by the array brought thus united to bear upon and disperse them. Had they then forgotten the moment when the indignant people<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5770-00000131"/> ple advanced upon the naked bayonets and defied them? They had desperate leaders then; now they no longer heard the voice, like a trumpet, calling them to follow to victory. They were not awed; they were not subdued; but thank Heaven, they vacillated for want of leaders, and reason resumed her sway before they came, and conscience whispered, "Return not evil for evil, but rather overcome evil with good." Truth arose in her purity, and cried, "You have done this for two hundred years, and lo! the result!" As she ceased stern Justice cried, "You have at the ballot-box placed your foes on your watch towers! Replace them by the same means with patriots, and you disarm them of power to do you injury; but at all times, remember that, no man can be a patriot that acknowledges allegiance to a foreign Potentate!"</p> 
               <p>The citizens who had been enrolled as officers to preserve the peace, were now disbanded, the military disappeared, and the blackened walls and desolated hearthstones were all that remained to the public eye, to tell of the tempest that had swept over the city.</p> 
               <p>The Republicans, now, that the passions of their fellow citizens had subsided, organized Ward Associations which, under the supervision of well-known and recognized patriots, exerted a salutary soothing influence over the city. They were firm and manly in their opposition to the insults and aggressions of the foes of liberty; but they denounced every effort to retaliate, and pointed to the only legitimate<pb n=""/> mode-the Ballot-box-for redress. They had sympathised with the oppressed, and mourned over the degradation of their country that, supinely, tolerated such offences-but they bowed to the majesty of the law, and while they acknowledged its defective supremacy, yielded, until they could displace it with those more in accordance with the principles of the Republic and its Constitution.</p> 
               <p>These Ward Associations which numbered thirty-six, sent a petition signed by their Presidents and Secretaries, to the Capital of the Union, praying their rulers to so modify the laws as to redress the grievances which were greater than they could bear, and under which the people had, usurping all authority, avenged themselves.</p> 
               <p>"The American Republicans do not," said they, "seek to disfranchise our naturalized citizens; nor to interfere with any human being in worshiping God according to the dictates of his conscience. And that, as American Republicans, we cannot surrender the liberty of speech and the press, the peaceful exercise of our rights to meet and express our sentiments, nor suffer the Bible to be driven from our Public Schools." (See Note 75.)</p> 
               <p>They knew not that, even at the head the fountain had been poisoned; that their foes were the sentinels guarding the citadel from friends without, while they held the lawmakers in chains riveted by Catholic votes that had, under the Arch-Bishop's own eye, been woven into a fascinating garb that raised them for a time above their fellows; but<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5770-00000132"/> when they had paid the price by which they had gained their elevation they sunk to the depths of infamy.</p> 
               <p>Many had done this also; but "the thirty pieces of silver" they had received turned their days into restlessness and their nights into horror; for, when their eyes closed in slumber their betrayed trusts arose in phantoms, and surrounding them, held up the manacled limbs of the oppressed, and besought them to break the fetters that they had riveted around them! Then the scene changed-and their sires, long since mingled with the dust, passed mournfully before them, and they turned from their upbraiding eyes to encounter the cajoling visage of the Arch-Bishop, which told of a post still more elevated, towering above every other compeer.</p> 
               <p>"Promise," said the Tempter, "that you will be guided by me in all your acts when seated on the pinnacle, and your elevation is certain. I hold the balance of power in my hand, and to whom I will I can give it!"</p> 
               <p>This petition was, by men who hoped to receive, or had already received, the "price," laid coldly aside, and the Republicans left to battle alone unaided, for the recovery of the <emph>Liberties</emph> that had been wrested from them. They had looked and hoped for assistance from their rulers; but when they saw them turn away, they banded together in one united bond, and resolved to go back to the first principles of nationality, and rear a structure which would supplant those who were traitors alike to the Republic<pb n=""/> and their constituents, and, as it arose, drive out the "Exchangers" from the Temple of Liberty, and replace them with patriots and freemen. (See Note 76.)</p> 
               <p>They took for their corner-stone the verdict of the jury of twenty thousand freemen, pronounced against a foreign potentate, in Independence Square-and for the pillars their martyred brothers and outraged laws, capping them with the chains with which the Arch-Bishop led blindly in his wake, the recreant sons of Republican sires.</p> 
               <p>The structure arose, and the Arch-Bishop and his myrmidons stood aghast! He had learned to cope successfully with the two great political parties; but this third one was an anomaly! It was composed of men he could neither cajole, frighten, nor buy; and they were already drawing to themselves the good and the true from both the other parties. Daily they augmented, until they were to be found wherever a Priest had poisoned a hamlet or cottage, unmasking the hypocrite, and shedding a moral purity over the tainted land which neutralized the serpent's venom, and caused him to hide his dark deeds beneath a more specious garb. (See Note 77.)</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop, alarmed for the result of this banding of the Republicans together, hastened to Philadelphia, to superintend new schemes for their defeat. The Confessor was not cautions and wary enough for his purpose, while the Priest, he had discovered, was intriguing with the rest of the Priesthood, to procure his own elevation to a Bishopric<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5770-00000133"/> ric; and so strongly was his heart set upon his success, that he had no time to work for the ambitious schemings of the Arch-Bishop. Their cause was a common one; but the Priest entered into it only so far as his own elevation could be served by it, while the Arch-Bishop ambitious of securing the reward which was only one step beneath the Tiara, could brook no delay. The outburst of patriotism in New York, by which they had elected JAMES HARPER Mayor, when he fancied he had cajoled them by specious flattery into inactivity, had proved to him how little reliance could be placed on appearances; and now, when the tempest had passed from over the city of Philadelphia, and he had fondly hoped for a reaction in his favor, this formidable Republican structure loomed threateningly before him.</p> 
               <p>The St. Leopold, which had been of such immense service to him from one end of the Union to the other, here fell powerless, for few of the Republicans employed foreign servants, and they had become so well versed in the strategems of their foes that they had learned to evade spies, and turn their own system of espionage upon themselves.</p> 
               <p>"We must create another organization for the especial purpose of circumventing the Republicans, composed solely of men of the Pat Mullen, John O'Neill, and Pat Lafferty stamp," said the Arch-Bishop to his coadjutors.</p> 
               <p>"It is necessary that some new plan be devised to outwit them," returned the Priest thoughtfully.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Let it be called the 'Association of Naturalized Irishmen of America,'" continued the Arch-Bishop, "and have for its object the maintenance of Catholics in office. Evidently some of our plans were defective, or they would never have miscarried in New York. We must guard against such mistakes in future, for the majority of our plans depends on keeping Catholics in office. The Pope would not be safe an hour here, did not the political leaders countenance his arrival. When he arrives we must have a Catholic President; his Holiness must be his guest by solicitation, in order to impress upon the people that the slightest indignity or lack of courtesy will not be tolerated!" (See Note 78.)</p> 
               <p>"Ah! my Lord, I fear, should that day ever arrive, the people would no more heed the President or the Pope than they did the military before St. Michael's!" remarked the Curate.</p> 
               <p>"Had I been in General Cadwalader's place, I would have given them a few rounds of grape, and then charged with the bayonets upon them. If I mistake not, that would have civilized them!" interrupted the Confessor, who could not banish from his mind the moment when, in the power of those he had outraged, but a step intervened between himself and the seething flames.</p> 
               <p>"It was better that he did not," returned the Arch-Bishop. "The people were so intoxicated by the successes they had achieved, that they would have torn the military<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5770-00000134"/> into pieces, burned and sacked the city. We were in fault at first, and should not have struck the first blow-it tells against us!"</p> 
               <p>"I am aware of that, and gave those fellows orders not to do it. Pat Mullen, in his zeal, forgot his directions, and the result is before us!" said the Confessor.</p> 
               <p>"Of which we are the gainers, as it is; still I am sorry we were obliged to draw the first blood."</p> 
               <p>"We were forced to it, my Lord," said the Confessor, "they would not resist, although Pat and his boys used every effort to provoke them. As it was, the Republicans, those arch-heretics and promoters of discord, have stood aloof from the people since the disturbance in the Market House, where they were joined by Gaven, the Renegade, Paul Gordon and Steinmitz; and they have been the leaders in this fray. It strikes me, if they were disposed of, we should have less trouble in controlling the people!"</p> 
               <p>"You are right," returned the Arch-Bishop, "and as they, by their contumacy, have drawn down the displeasure of the Church, they may, without sin, be destroyed whereever found, and by any one that desires to do the Church a great service."</p> 
               <p>"Would it not be better, my Lord, to convince them of the enormity of their sins, and induce them to return to the bosom of the Church, instead of sending them unprepared into eternity?" asked the Curate.</p> 
               <p>"Reform the Arch-fiend as soon!" growled the Confessor<pb n=""/> fessor, who knew better than his coadjutors the provocations these men had received, which had driven them from the pale of the Church and opened their eyes to its hypocrisy, and aroused every vindictive feeling in their natures.</p> 
               <p>"Our new Order, which I propose to institute, perchance, may accomplish their absence or reformation, it matters little which. Pat Mullen I propose for its President, and I am sure his arguments for conversion will be of the knock-down order, and may be used with effect on these men, as it is a kind of argument which has been too little used for the good of the Church, for there are circumstances when no other is penetrating enough to convince of error. I will draw up papers for their organization, and you will see them carried into effect, keeping me advised at all times of their progress. You will also press the fulfilment of those Circulars to the very letter, and with the utmost rigor purge your flocks from every heretical book." (See Note 79.)</p> 
               <p>"It is almost impossible to do this, my Lord, as the emissaries of the heretics go around among our flocks and distribute, free of cost, Bibles, Tracts, and all manner of vile trash!" returned the Priest.</p> 
               <p>"They must then be treated to a few of Pat Mullen's arguments. Such a reception will make them more careful of their favors again in that quarter."</p> 
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5770-00000135"/> 
               <p>"What are we to do, my Lord, with those who persist in sending children to the heretic schools?"</p> 
               <p>"Hurl at them the anathemas of the Church, and if they heed not that, let them be pursued with the displeasure of their Superiors, whose authority they have contemned. Let a blight fall on all their undertakings, and then, when they have been reduced to beggary and want, and find themselves spurned by their fellows, they will of necessity come back to the Church, acknowledge their sins, and the justness of the hand of God which, through His Church, has been laid heavily upon them!"</p> 
               <p>"This is not always the case, my Lord. Steinmitz has not yielded, and I mistake the man if he ever does," returned the Confessor.</p> 
               <p>"Because you did not pursue the right course towards him! He has prejudiced the people against you, by reporting a story about burning his Bible! Why did you not prosecute him for uttering a libel against you to the detriment of your character? You might have done it, and sustained it too, as no one but his family saw the act, and their evidence would have gone for nothing, as they were equally criminal in uttering the libel. If you had been zealous, you might have proved a conspiracy to ruin your character and usefulness, and thereby have raised sympathy for yourself. By the same means you could have silenced that abduction affair! You see, brothers," he continued, "how many ways you suffer to pass, unheeded, for the glory and<pb n=""/> advancement of our common cause; for we must rise or fall together. If we can bring about a state of affairs that will warrant a removal of the Papal Chair to America, we may then reach the summit of earthly grandeur-a summit from which we may contemplate the length and breadth of this continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Northern to the Southern Oceans, obedient to our behests. Shall we then, falter, brethren, while the shadows rest upon us? Should we not rather labor the harder that when the glorious dawn that strikes down the heretics' banner and raises the Cross in its stead, shall arrive, we shall have the house prepared for the reception of our Master-the Vicar of God? Mullen will have distinct orders what course he is to pursue; and should he get into trouble, as, in all probability he will, you must not appear in the matter, but silently work to procure his discharge at any cost. If he cannot be released, and should the evidence against him be too strong to admit of a discharge, let the law take its course, and I will procure an immediate pardon!"</p> 
               <p>"Suppose, my Lord," suggested the Curate, "that, on the strength of the directions you give him, he commits an unprovoked murder? then hewill lose his life! whereas if he were not placed in the peculiar position you propose, he would hold in check his fierce passions, for you are well aware he is no lamb!"</p> 
               <p>"Did you ever know of a man losing a life he had<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5770-00000136"/> jeopardized for the good of our cause? I am not so powerless as to allow the hand of the heretics to touch the life of a servant. There is enough of us to prove an alibi, and our position is too lofty to admit a doubt of our testimony!" (See Note 80.)</p> 
               <p>"Suppose he were caught in the act, my Lord; then it would be not only wrong but impossible!" observed the cautious but startled Curate.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! short sighted imbecile! have you no thought how easy it is to prove justifiable homicide?"</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my Lord, I had not so familiarized myself with crime," said the Curate, as he turned with a cold contemptuous curl of the lip from his Superior. The cool calculating heartlessness, with which the Arch-Bishop trampled alike on virtue and vice to secure his ambitious schemes, had disgusted him. He had looked upon the Arch-Bishop as one whose exalted station must necessarily be surrounded by a halo of wisdom and virtue; but now, when he saw his model stoop to the depths of vice, he turned with loathing from the creature who, like Lucifer of old, in his efforts to make himself a God, had fallen below his fellows.</p> 
               <p>Where was the unerring immutability of the Church he had hitherto bowed to with reverence and awe? Were the principles laid down by its leader in America, in all their enormity, sanctioned by his Holiness at Rome? Was there then no right, nor justice, purity nor charity within its<pb n=""/> pale, but one wicked unlawful strife for self-aggrandizement from which all divine vitality fled, leaving it a body without a soul, a tiger that stood at bay, lashing its sides and growling defiance to every living thing that obstructed its pathway, or sought to lure from its fangs its helpless victims!</p> 
               <p>In vain the Curate sought the attributes of his divine master in the sentiments of his superiors, for he was yet young in years, and in an uncontaminated heart had kept the image of his Creator bright with a holy life, and a single purpose in fulfiling the divine and moral law to his Creator and fellow-men. He had never felt the corroding canker of ambition eating out the vitality of his being, or the fierce warring of the passions that, spurning control converted it into a volcano that, in its mighty throes shook the earth to its centre.</p> 
               <p>He went out from his Superiors a wiser, but a sorrowing man. The veil had been lifted, and he saw the whitened sepulchre within.</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop read what had been passing in the Curate's heart, in the varying expression of his features, and, with a sarcastic smile hovering over his mouth, said, as the door closed behind him-</p> 
               <p>"That man must be watched; he is not fit for work like ours!"</p> 
               <p>"Only a little chicken-hearted," returned the Confessor. "It is an ordeal we all have to pass through, and<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5770-00000137"/> the harder the struggle the more zealous the servant is made."</p> 
               <p>A shade of bitterness rested on the brow of the Arch-Bishop at this sally of his coadjutor. Was he thinking of his sturdy boyhood when he toiled from morn till night for his daily bread? and then laid his head in peace upon his pillow, and slept the sweet sleep of childhood? Alas, no such slumber visited his Lordship's couch now! Or, was he thinking of his dawning manhood among the green groves and luscious fruits where light footsteps and rosy fingers helped to train the dewy mosses and climbing vines? No shadows of ambition had then cast its blight over his heart when there, in that little <emph>Eden,</emph> he had taken one to his heart, and whispered the sweet name of wife in her ears! Where was she now? Alas, ambition had driven her hence, and she, broken-hearted, slept within the silent tomb! And every gentle emotion of his heart had been buried with her, except the link between it, and the discarded but no less loved one!</p> 
               <p>"Much has been said, my Lord," remarked the Priest, "about finding fire-arms in the hands of those classes who were not able to purchase them for themselves; and the value of which was more than all else they possessed: and I would suggest the feasibility of procuring, if it can be done, arms from the State, for the ostensible purpose of defending the Churches, but in reality to distribute among the people?'</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop recalled his scattered thoughts at these discordant words, and replied-</p> 
               <p>"A most excellent proposition, as it will give our procedure an air of authority, and impress the people that, in defiance of the charge of Judge Parsons, and the presentments of the Grand Jury, the Executive of the State is on our side, and sympathizes with us. Another collision must be brought round soon; and if the military are on the ground again, we must endeavor to bring them into contact with the heretics; as in that case they will destroy each other, and we shall come off victors without shedding one drop of Catholic blood!" (See Note 81.)</p> 
               <p>"If Col. Page had done his duty, and gone to fighting instead of talking, we could have effected the collision before," said the Confessor.</p> 
               <p>"The plans I have nearly perfected will strike a blow that will teach the heretic hordes a principle to which they are strangers-<emph>obedience.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Then we can, and not until then, carry out the instructions of your Grace's Circular," returned the Priest. "Now, they fly to the secular power, if we chastise them in any way whatever; and until the secular and Church governments are united, we can never accomplish our purpose." (See Note 82.)</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
               <argument> 
                  <p>Approach of the Anniversary of American Independence-The people still moving-The cause of self-defence-Soldiers drilled in St. Philip's-The Church turned into an Arsenal-Indignation of the people-Immense crowds gather around it-The Military again called out-General Cadwalader orders his men to fire on the people, but revokes the command-A Committee appointed to search the Church-Duplicity of the Priest-Arms and ammunition found-Terrible excitement-Hon. Mr. Naylor placed in custody-Gaven fires the Church-The crowds re-assemble-Cannon in the hands of the people-Naylor released-Arrival of the "City Guard"-They fire upon the people-The killed and wounded-Awful confusion-Pat Mullen's exultation-Jesuitical Schemes, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>THE anniversary of our American Independence was drawing near-a day dear to the hearts of every freeman in the Union. Prejudices and animosities were forgotten, and together in harmony they labored to perfect arrangements to celebrate the day befitting the great principles they honored. Thus they and their forefathers had annually done, since that memorable day, when they threw off the yoke of oppression and won, with their blood, the right to be freemen. Yet, as the day drew near, they remembered the aggressions that had been made against this great principle which had served to bring it nearer and dearer to their hearts; for it had led them to think more deeply, and scan more closely, the political horizon that hung above<pb n=""/> the Union. They then saw the tempest that had passed over them with so devastating a fury, still hung over other cities; and every mail that arrived told of the desolation it was creating. They also saw a heavy portentious cloud again looming over their own city, while the low mutterings came ominously to their ears, for it said in burning tones, "The Governor has put into the hands of William Dunn, the State's Arms and ammunition, and he is nightly drilling soldiers in St. Philip's Church, to prepare them to make an onslaught on the processions by which we propose to reverence the day that gave birth to our Republic! Priests' houses on our proposed route have been turned into barracks for a crew, headed by one Pat Mullen who, with their clubs are to break into our ranks and drive us from the streets; and if we turn upon them they have whole brigades ready to pour their deadly fire upon us!"</p> 
               <p>"Nay," whispered Charity, "heed it not; the voice comes from the cloud that has gone over! You will not be again molested!"</p> 
               <p>The day dawned bright and clear upon the city, into which the surrounding population began to pour, until the streets were thronged by those who came to do reverence to the spot hallowed by being the sanctuary where sixty-eight years ago had rung out in clarion tones-"Lo, we are free!" and by the second Declaration that said, "The free shall govern the free," which even now rang in their<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5770-00000139"/> ears; for the patriots that uttered it were now before them, and their brothers' blood that had called it forth was still moist where they fell, and their graves were still unsodden."</p> 
               <p>Never, in the memory of the oldest inhabitant had such rejoicing for the blessed boon of Liberty gone up from Philadelphia, as on that Fourth of July, 1844! The dangers they had escaped made it still more precious, and though they sorrowed for their martyred brothers, they rejoiced that they had not died in vain, as by their death they had aroused the whole Union to the evils that menaced it. The day passed without a shadow to dim the general rejoicing, and they retired to their homes, thanking a protecting Providence for the restoration of peace to their city, and the dispersion of the clouds which had hung threateningly in their horizon.</p> 
               <p>The shades of night gathered over the city, when a wild rumor startled every heart from its security. It was said that, St. Philip's was armed, barricaded, and filled with men; that armed Catholics were in private dwellings-and that ten thousand men were surrounding the buildings, demanding them to deliver up their arms and disperse!</p> 
               <p>An Alderman remonstrated with the Priest for his injudicious, unlawful conduct, when he retorted defiantly-</p> 
               <p>"What I have done to-day, I will do to-morrow. I built this church, and I will die in it, before I will yield it to another!"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>You must, however, give into my possession the arms and ammunition in the church," replied the officer.</p> 
               <p>"We have none here!" doggedly returned the Priest.</p> 
               <p>The Sheriff now arrived and also made the same demand, when finding he would be compelled to submit, as the threatening tone of the people momentarily became more violent, he admitted they had brought thither for personal use a few fire arms, and delivered them into the hands of the Sheriff, with the best grace he could assume after his denial. (See Note 83.)</p> 
               <p>As they were brought forth, the Sheriff was greeted with loud cheers of approval, and as this sound died away, they demanded that a committee of their citizens, selected from their number, and led by the Alderman, be appointed to search the Church for more fire-arms and ammunition, which they believed were still within its walls. The Priest loudly protested against this act, after the concession he had made, but his protestations only assured the crowd he had his reasons for it, and, exasperated, they threatened to enter in a body and search for themselves, if the committee were not admitted, which the citizens had already selected.</p> 
               <p>The friends of both parties who had no interest in the matter, excepting what every citizen had in seeing peace preserved, advised compliance, while every moment the Priest grew more dogged and pointed in his refusal. The people, led on by Paul and Gaven, drew closer around the Church, and the Priest read in their stern, determined<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC5770-00000140"/> features, the crisis that was momentarily approaching, and as a prolonged shout arose, he turned pale, expecting every instant to see the flames rising around him. The Committee, urged on by the people, would no longer delay, but entering the vestibule, in determined but respectful tones, demanded the keys of the Church. (See Note 84.)</p> 
               <p>Hoping by a seeming compliance to evade a thorough search, he now assented and gave up the keys. The first door they opened, they involuntarily stepped backwards, for before them stood two brawny Irishmen, with fixed bayonets. Recovering from the momentary trepidation, they disarmed them, and found their muskets were heavily loaded. Opening the door at which they stood sentry, twenty-seven more muskets heavily loaded also were found stacked around the room. Placing a guard out of their own number over these men and muskets, they proceeded on in their search. Entering another room they found eight more men armed with loaded muskets, whom they placed under guard also, and then continued their search. On arriving at the room where the religious services were held, they encountered the Priest, whose scowling brow and wild flashing eyes showed the storm that was raging in his breast. One of their number placed the recreant Priest in front of the Altar, and then said-</p> 
               <p>"I ask you, on your sacred word as a man and a Christian, have you any more men here?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"No!" growled the enraged Priest, in angry tones.</p> 
               <p>"Have you any more arms?"</p> 
               <p>"No!" was the Priest's curt reply.</p> 
               <p>"Have you any more ammunition?</p> 
               <p>"No!"</p> 
               <p>Finding they could elicit nothing from the Priest, they proceeded on their search. Reaching the vestibule whence they first started, and where they remembered seeing several doors, they demanded the keys which opened them of the Priest, as they found those they obtained of him would not unlock them. He demurred, saying that, they contained property belonging to another, which he assured them was nothing more than lemons, lemon-syrup, and such articles.</p> 
               <p>The committee were not to be turned from their purpose, and reluctantly the key was given up, the door opened, revealing a keg of powder, several boxes of percussion caps, besides a quantity of buck shot. This then was the credence they were to give his word most solemnly pledged on his own altar, and in the name of all a man of honor holds dear! With a lock of scornful contempt for the poltroon, the committee proceeded on their way. In a closet which was under the stairs leading from the vestibule to the room behind the altar, they found seven single and two double-barreled guns, and several pistols, besides hundreds of cartridges, some of which had eight, ten or more slugs and buck shot in them; and on examining some of the<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5770-00000141"/> muskets they were found with seven, eight, and even nine finger loads in them. (See Note 85.)</p> 
               <p>"This then," said one of the committee indignantly, "is the value you attach to a word of honor! or, know you not the meaning of the word?"</p> 
               <p>"No faith need be kept with heretics, unless policy demands it; and when I said what I did, it was with a mental reservation!" said the Priest. (See Note 86.)</p> 
               <p>"Does not your manhood cry out against such dishonorable, imbecile acts; or, have you none left within your breast?" demanded the committee-man in astonishment at the impudent coolness of the Priest.</p> 
               <p>"The end justifies the means; and, in such cases, it is both allowable and honorable to practise them," he returned with the air of a bravado.</p> 
               <p>"Heaven preserve us from contamination, if such is really your principles!" ejaculated the committee-man, with a gesture and tone of disgust.</p> 
               <p>They found in other places quantities of munitions of war, and on counting their booty, they discovered they had secured seventy-two stand of arms; and this in a Church-a professing Christian Church-dedicated to the worship of the living God! while Christ on earth taught peace and good will to all men, as the foundation of every virtue and moral act.</p> 
               <p>They bore their booty in triumph away, and when the surging sea of humanity saw this terrible array of deadly<pb n=""/> weapons brought forth, and knew how fearful was the preparation against the peace of their city, their passions that had smouldered for the last few weeks, broke forth in a long terrific cry of anger, while they swayed to and fro like an ocean in a tempest. JUDGE CONRAD had now arrived and used his influence to still the rising storm, and though they listened to him for a moment, they moved on to their purpose.</p> 
               <p>The General now ordered out the military, and soon the soldiers in long, solid columns, bore down on the unarmed, defenceless citizens, followed by two heavy pieces of artillery. Forcing his way among the people as far as he could compel them to give way, he pointed the artillery towards the thickest of the living mass, and cried brandishing his sword, as the match was held threateningly above-</p> 
               <p>"Disperse! Disperse to your homes! or I will mow every one of you down!"</p> 
               <p>"For God's sake, General, don't fire!" cried the Hon. CHARLES NAYLOR, who was standing near.</p> 
               <p>"Sir, who are you that dares to dictate to me! Such as you make the mob! I will do my duty!" cried the General in an imperious tone.</p> 
               <p>"This is no mob, sir!" returned Mr. Naylor, "but citizens collected to disarm a Church which, in their midst, in time of peace, has been turned into an arsenal and barracks, for what reason they too well know!"</p> 
               <pb n="284-285 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5770-00000142"/> 
               <p>Loud cheers for their defender from calumny rent the air. The General seeing they heeded not his command, ordered the match to be applied.</p> 
               <p>"No! No!" cried Mr. Naylor, "you shall not fire on the people, you have no right to cut down the citizens," or, he continued, as he sprung before the cannon's mouth, "if you will fire, my body shall break the charge! I will be your first victim!" (See Note 87.)</p> 
               <p>Intimidated by this noble forgetfulness of self to save the many, the General recoiled from his murderous purpose, while the artilleryman hesitated to mangle the limbs and drench the streets in the blood of his brothers. Feeling it necessary to preserve his authority, yet not daring to fire with Mr. Naylor before the cannon, he compromised the matter by ordering his troops to seize him as a prisoner, and confine him under guard in the Church. Mr. Naylor submitted, and, amidst the groans and execrations of the people against the military, he was dragged away and put under guard in the basement of the Church.</p> 
               <p>"Never fear for me!" he cried as he was hurried away, "it is better thus than that you should have been slaughtered!"</p> 
               <p>The citizens, at the instigation of the Republicans, were then induced to disperse. They feared a collision with the military which the course the latter was pursuing was intended to accelerate. Happily night was drawing near, and in groups they moved away but there was an ominous<pb n=""/> 
                  <figure> 
                     <head>MR. NAYLOR ARRESTS THE ORDER TO FIRE ON THE PEOPLE.</head> 
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5770-00000143"/>
                  <pb n=""/> sternness and determined purpose that flashed from their eyes, which assured the observing that this was not the last of it.</p> 
               <p>Morning came, and revealed to the citizens the Church garrisoned by the "Hibernia Greens." This once more drew the people around it, and when they found Mr. Naylor was still detained a prisoner, they loudly demanded his release. This being denied, they with their constantly augmenting numbers threatened to storm the Church and release him.</p> 
               <p>The General was again on the ground with his military who, by their unsoldierly acts, served to heap fuel on the rising flames of passion that were fast rising beyond control. Towards noon a scantling was procured by the citizens and applied to the west front door, which yielded to their united efforts, and in a few moments the pannels fell crashing to the ground, and the people rushing in, led forth in triumph, with loud shouts, the captive whom they committed to the care of Alderman Hartz, who conducted him home.</p> 
               <p>Elated at their success, the citizens now demanded that the "Hibernia Greens" be brought forth and discharged. "We will not," they cried, "suffer a garrison of soldiers in our midst! We are freemen, and our free laws which we ourselves make, shall be the only force we will have among us! The crowd was augmented by men who had procured and dragged to the spot two cannon, which they<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5770-00000144"/> pointed towards the Church, and before they could be prevented one was discharged, but without any damage being done, as the whole charge hit the solid masonry instead of the window at which it was aimed, from which it rebounded and fell to the ground.</p> 
               <p>Water being adroitly thrown by a bystander on the priming of the other, an eighteen pounder, as it was about being fired, its object was defeated, and the citizens turned to ascertain the cause.</p> 
               <p>Taking advantage of this, Thomas D. Grover sprang upon the cannon, and with Judge Conrad, appealed to them as citizens to spare the Church, when they good humoredly cheered them, and desisted from their attacks. With joy the Republicans saw the momentary advantage gained over the excited passions of the people, and Mr. Levin, mounting the other cannon, the two depicted to them the enormity of destroying the edifice.</p> 
               <p>"Turn out the Hibernia Greens," was their answer. "All we ask is, that no soldiers be garrisoned among us! Think you we will allow our churches to be filled with an armed foe?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Levin hearing the crowd were pressing in the rear of the Church, went around to stay them, when his place on the cannon was occupied by Mr. Titus. Meanwhile those in charge of the eighteen pounder yielded to the solicitation of Mr. Grover, and dragged the cannon away; while a party of Republicans, managed to get possession<pb n=""/> of the other and dragging it down to the Delaware, pointed it towards the Jersey shore, reprimed and discharged it. Gaven had now gained the basement, and firing it, quickly disappeared among the crowd. The smoke in volumes rolled up, when the Republicans rushed in and smothered the rising flames.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Grover with nineteen other citizens, at this juncture, formed themselves into a Committee of Protection for the Church, and taking up their station before the door, had pacified the people, and they already were beginning quietly to disperse, when the Commanding General rode up with fresh troops, and demanded the surrender of the Church held by the committee into his hands. The Committee readily complied, but the act exasperated the people anew, and with yells of rage they greeted the military and their chief; while far above it arose the taunts and gibes of Pat Mullen's crew, making the air hideous with resounding cries, arousing the people to a higher pitch of exasperation.</p> 
               <p>"Away with the military! We want no military among us!" shouted some, while others brought back the cannon, accompanied by two other pieces, all loaded with deadly missiles. Capt. Hill, of the "City Guard," came into collision with a citizen, at the corner of Second and Queen streets, and finding him more than a match for him, and seeing he was like to be overpowered, gave the word of command-"<emph>fire!</emph>" There was a blinding flash, a loud<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5770-00000145"/> report, and the crowd broke and fled, while the groans of the dying and wounded, mingled with the execrations of the citizens and the joyous huzzas of Pat Mullen and his crew!</p> 
               <p>"Be jabers; an' give it to them! Cut each others' throats, and then, by the Blessed Saints, wont we have it all our own way! Faith, an' I thought if I could not make ye fight, my boys, I could make ye fight among yerselves! It don't matter which you fight ye spalpeens."</p> 
               <p>The people had retired only to arm themselves, but soon returned to the fray, with the determination of driving back the military who had pointed their arms against their brothers. Led on by Gaven and Paul Gordon, they placed their cannon so as to range down Queen Street. They now became the assailants of the military who returned the fire at irregular intervals, as the streets were now shrouded in such intense darkness as to preclude the possibility of discerning their foe, except by the fitful flash of their guns. Major General Patterson detailed the "German Battalion," with two field pieces, with the "Washington Cavalry," and "First City Troop," under the command of General Roumfort, as a reinforcement, to the scene of action. Rifle-balls whistled like hail around, while the heavy discharges of artillery as they raked the streets, shook the houses to their foundations. Fearful havoc was made in the solid ranks of the military, until dismayed they sought shelter wherever a chance offered, being greeted as<pb n=""/> they fled by the shots of citizens who, as they looked upon their slaughtered brothers, resolved never to return to their homes until they had freed their city from the twenty thousand soldiery that menaced it.</p> 
               <p>Every effort of the officers and of the Sheriff to induce the crowd to retire from the streets, so that order might again be restored to the distracted city, met the same reply.</p> 
               <p>"Withdraw your troops, and all will be well. We will never yield our rights to the soldiery. We are around our homes; you have been led hither at the instigation and influence of our foes! Return to your homes; we are already at ours. Our blood lies gory on the street pavements, and along the gutters; and be assured, it shall run in torrents down the streets, before we will be driven hence!" (See Note 88.)</p> 
               <p>The Southwark Commissioners waited in a body upon Major General Patterson and Sheriff M'Michael, pledging themselves to protect and preserve the peace, if they would comply with the people's demand, and withdraw the obnoxious soldiery, whose interference had led to the murder of brother by his brother; while the foes of both exultingly watched at a safe distance the long looked for result, and when the word reached them that the Sheriff and Major General had yielded to the people's demands, and had ordered the military from the district, they heaped curses of cowardice upon them. What they had<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5770-00000146"/> labored to produce for two months had proved ineffective; when they felt assured, from the last three days' events, success would crown their efforts, and the soldiery and people be involved in a general massacre. The promises which they had obtained from the Executive that, "Should another outbreak occur similar to the Kensington affair, it should be put down by military force," had been of no avail; for now the military were marching from the field of contention at the command of the citizens! In vain the Jesuits remonstrated, threatened, and stormed at such a course! The wishes of the people were complied with; the "Committee of Protection" once more took possession of the evacuated premises, and the citizens quietly retired from the streets! Peace! blessed peace! again reigned over the city. But, alas! many a hearthstone was craped in wo! Many a heart was bowed in grief for the father, son, or brother who had fallen to appease the malignant ambition that had drenched their city in blood; by alarming the people and rousing them for their own protection, and then calling forth the promised "military force," to disperse them! They had counted on the slaughter of thousands of freemen; and scarcely a hundred had fallen! They had hoped to weaken their force by striking a blow which should paralyze and appal them, so that, in the reaction, they could rivet chains of bondage around them. But instead of this, they had aroused the whole Union against them, and even the more liberal of their own party<pb n=""/> cried shame on such ingratitude, and deserted them. (See Note 89.)</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop's haughty soul reeled beneath the blow that he had struck at Liberty, but which she with her quiet grace had received on her shield, whence it rebounded upon his own head, stunning him with its force. Twice had he been foiled in Philadelphia. New York had, with her strong, silent power, disowned him! while the dissensions he had raised elsewhere, had in many instances, proved equally abortive. From the large cities he hoped the most; for he contended that, "If we can gain supremacy in these, it will influence the rural districts, and with exertions we can carry the State Elections with them." (See Note 90.)</p> 
               <p>"Lewis C. Levin and Samuel R. Kramer," he said, "have committed themselves in those vipers-their papers-which they throw out to poison the minds of the people against us; and I will have them arrested for libel! If I can by this means draw heavily upon their purses, I can silence them!"</p> 
               <p>For him to resolve was to act; and within forty-eight hours, to the dismay of the friends of Liberty, these two men were, at the instance of the minions of the Arch-Bishop, arrested and put under heavy bail to answer at their County Courts, for having warned the people of approaching danger-and when it came, saving even their enemies' property from destruction! Had not the promised<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5770-00000147"/> "military force" arrived, they would also have saved the lives of their brothers, and an indelible stain would not now rest on the Executive who would thus yield, and even furnish arms from the State Arsenal to equip a sectarian building in time of peace. (See Note 91.)</p>

               <argument> 
                  <p>American sentiments increasing-Republican Associations in the States-Their principles defined-National Convention at Philadelphia-Adoption of a "Declaration of Principles"-The Convention's Address to the People-Their Grievances set forth-Traitors to American feelings-The Arch-Bishop again in his Library-He receives private letters from Rome, which announce the death of Pope GREGORY, and the election of MASTAI FERRETTI-His indignation at himself, and the failure of his own plans-He becomes tranquil, and plots the overthrow of the new Pope-He resolves to go to Rome-A letter from the Confessor, announcing the death of Gaven-He ascribes it to a Railroad accident.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>TIME rolled on, but the aroused spirit of the sons of the Pilgrim Fathers slumbered not. They had united in a common cause, their hearts glowing with the unquenched fires that Liberty when she arose had kindled there, and for months they had striven to mould the crude elements of their being into form that, pure but misshapen, like a nugget of fine gold, lost half its value for want of the master hands to convert it into use.</p> 
               <p>Bands of Republicans had arisen in every State in the Union, each one with the same singleness of purpose-that of retaining for themselves and posterity the rights and liberties bequeathed to their keeping by their ancestors; but, they suffered in strength for want of union and harmony of feeling, which called for an early consideration.</p> 
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5770-00000148"/> 
               <p>This led them to call a Convention "On Principles," to be composed of unexceptionable delegates from every State in the Union, to meet on the next Anniversary of the American Independence, and to be held on the ground already consecrated <emph>to Liberty.</emph> It was in Philadelphia July 4, 1776, that the charter that gave liberty to every freeborn American citizen, was first proclaimed to the world. And now, July 4th, 1845, another "National Convention" was convoked on the same spot, hallowed by Liberty, that soared upward with outspread wings, and rested not until she had led America to freedom. Here assembled the noble, brave and gifted Patriots of modern times! Men who, armed with truth and right, came from every State burthened with the crude Patriotic elements that had arisen from the insults and aggressions which the wily enemy had heaped upon them! They were bearing them to the crucible, over which Justice, armed with her unerring test, presided, guarded by Truth, Mercy and Charity. (See Note 92.)</p> 
               <p>The crucible received the golden grains, and purified sent them forth united in unbroken links, the purity and brightness of which startled the Union, while it caused its sons to leap for joy, and its foes to gnash their teeth with rage.</p> 
               <p>This link they named "NATIVE AMERICAN," and its object, "The preservation of the Institutions and Liberties of<pb n=""/> the Union," to bind them into a fraternal band such as held the Patriots of 1776!</p> 
               <p>"We"-wrote DR. REYNELL COATES, in the Address to the people, of this body of Freemen who, commanded by the high moral tone of their deliberations, the respect of even their enemies-"the Delegates elect to the first National Convention of the Native American body of the United States of America, assembled for the purpose of devising a plan of concerted political action in defence of American Institutions against the encroachments of foreign influence, open or concealed, hereby solemnly, and before Almighty God, make known to our fellow citizens, our country, and the world, the following incontrovertible facts, to which, in duty to the cause of human rights, and the claims of our beloved country, we mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.</p> 
               <p>"It is an incontrovertible truth that, the civil institutions of the United States of America, have been seriously affected, and that they now stand in imminent peril from the rapid and enormous increase of the body of residents of foreign birth, imbued with foreign feelings, and of an ignorant and immoral character, who receive, under the present lax and unreasonable laws of naturalization the elective franchise and the right of elligibility to political office.</p> 
               <p>"In former years this body of foreign citizens was recruited chiefly from the victims of political oppression, or the active and intelligent mercantile adventurers of other<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5770-00000149"/> lands; and it then constituted a slender representation of the best classes of the foreign population, well fitted to add strength to the State, and capable of being readily educated in the peculiarly American science of political self-government. Such a class of aliens were followed by no foreign demagogues-they were courted by no domestic demagogues-they were purchased by no parties-they were debauched by no emissaries of kings! A wall of fire separated them from such fearful influences, erected by their intelligence, their knowledge, their virtue and love of freedom.</p> 
               <p>"For the last twenty years the alms-houses of Europe have been emptied on our coasts, not casually or to a trivial extent, but systematically and upon a constantly increasing scale. The lives of our citizens have been attempted in the streets of our capital cities by madmen, just liberated from European hospitals, upon the express condition that they should be transported to America. By the orders of European Governments, the punishment of crimes has been commuted to banishment to the Land of the Free, and criminals in irons have crossed the ocean to be cast loose upon society on their arrival upon our shores, and now the United States is rapidly becoming the lazar-house and penal colony of Europe. It is of such material that we profess to manufacture free and enlightened citizens by a process occupying three short years at most, but practically oftentimes embraced in a much shorter time!</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Formerly emigrants sought only for an honest livelihood for themselves and families, and rarely meddled with the institutions of which it was impossible they could comprehend the nature: <emph>Now</emph> each new-comer seeks political preferment, and struggles to fasten upon the public purse with avidity, in strict proportion to his ignorance and unworthiness of public trust-having been <emph>sent</emph> for the purpose of obtaining political ascendency in the government of the nation-having been <emph>sent</emph> to exalt their allies to power-having been <emph>sent</emph> to work a revolution from republican freedom to the divine rights of monarchs.</p> 
               <p>"This body has formed and encouraged political combinations holding the balance of power between opposing parties, which combinations have offered their votes and influence to the highest bidder, in exchange for pledges of official position and patronage! It has boasted of giving Governors to our States, and Chief Magistrates to the Nation!</p> 
               <p>"It has encouraged political combinations for the purpose of effecting sectarian measures!</p> 
               <p>"It has given rise to the organization and arming of foreign banditti, leagued for the purpose of controlling the freedom of discussion and opposing the constitutional assembling of American freeman seeking the redress of political grievances, which lawless bands have repeatedly threatened, assaulted and temporarily dispersed lawful political meetings of native citizens, in various places.</p> 
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC5770-00000150"/> 
               <p>"This host of foreign assassins have reddened the gutters of the second city in the Union, with the blood of unarmed native citizens, without even the semblance of a provocation, and with the avowed determination to prevent any political assemblage of the natives of the soil, of a sovereign American State.</p> 
               <p>"Frustrated in this attempt by the ungovernable fury of an outraged community, moving in a mass, to avenge such insults to the flag of their country, torn and trampled beneath the feet of the very refuse of Europe, these ruffians and their abettors have fomented open riot and insurrection. Collision of opinion has thus been formed by collision of arms in deadly array, in the very sanctuary of our freedom, by the myrmidons of the crowned heads of Europe!</p> 
               <p>"For these reasons, we recommend the immediate organization of the truly patriotic native citizens throughout the United States, for the purpose of resisting the progress of foreign influence in the conduct of American affairs." (See Note 93.)</p> 
               <p>The patriotic elements which composed this NATIVE AMERICAN band, came home to the people with irresistible force. In it they recognized the spirit that actuated their sires of 1776! It came to them when they saw the Union distracted by conflicting elements, and torn by dissensions, raised by the commands of a foreign Potentate! Thankful that a way was opened to free their beloved native<pb n=""/> tive land from insolence and mismanagement, they gathered around it as the Ark that alone could save them from the terrific storm that was gathering on their political horizon. They came from all ranks and all classes-from the man of God-like intellect, like Webster, to the humble citizen who knew no more than how to read his Bible and thank Heaven that he knew even that!</p> 
               <p>Every man who was an American at heart, looked on with admiration, and bowed with reverence before the great principle for which they contended. Yet, alas! many stood aloof, and even launched calumny at those patriots; for they remembered with bitterness in their hearts that, their own antecedents forever precluded them from mingling with the uncontaminated and pure. The price-"the thirty pieces of silver"-was wormwood in their hearts, and tinged with bitterness every thought that came from their breasts. It circled them around; it lay, like the mark of Cain, on their brows; and when honest men passed them, it cried-"BEHOLD THE MAN THAT SOLD HIS BIRTHRIGHT FOR A PRICE! (See Note 94.)</p> 
               <p>The patriots knew whence and why the calumnies were hurled at them, and with an honest scorn, such as only an honorable mind is capable of feeling, on their lips, they passed them silently by, fearing to touch in order to disprove them, least they became contaminated by the foul excresence. They knew that truth and right must triumph, and what mattered it to them, if malignity stood in its path?<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC5770-00000151"/> Could not she soar above it? They felt and knew she could! yet, they sorrowed much that sons of Republican sires should fall so low; and when fallen, glory like Lucifer at the depth of their fall!</p> 
               <p>Time elapsed, and the Arch-Bishop sat alone in his library where we first saw him; and now, as then, the door opened and his servant Riley entered. But instead of bearing a single letter, he had several, and laying them on the table before him, he retired as silently as he came. With a practised eye he saw the spirit of unrest lay heavily on his master's heart, and at such times he knew, by past experience, that he desired no companionship-no sound to fall on his ear which would break the spell that lay, like a pall, around him. Was he thinking of his deep laid plans of the past which the Americans had thwarted; or was he planning some new scheme that should be more silent and sure to undermine the Temple of Liberty in the future?</p> 
               <p>No! he was thinking of neither. His thoughts had wandered away to Papal Rome, and now hovered around the pinnacle he had at one time believed nearly within his grasp. In vain had he urged the fulfilment of the promise made by his Master, arguing that the will with which he had undertaken the reforms demanded, ought to be taken for the deed, for in that he had not wholly accomplished his purpose, he was not to be censured, but rather had earned applause, because he had prosecuted them with so<pb n=""/> much vigor. "I have," he urged, "silenced in a measure the press! and now they dare not, as formerly, utter such barefaced heresies. This has been done by intimidating some of the Editors; by the lash vigorously applied by the <emph>Pat Mullen</emph> arguments, and others, by libel prosecutions. Out-door declamations are not so frequent as formerly, and the Bible, though in many of the schools, is not looked upon with as much veneration as previously."</p> 
               <p>The old Pope had become deaf to his entreaties-perhaps the wily occupant of the pinnacle thought the best way to have his work well done was, to reserve the pay until it was completed. Certain it was that, in the summer of 1846, he was still Arch-Bishop, instead of having obtained the summons to repair to Rome to receive the title of Cardinal of America!</p> 
               <p>Listlessly he raised one of the letters, and at once recognized the well known writing of his private emissary, whom he had won over to sell the secrets of the Vatican for gold! It said-"Gregory is dying. No one knows it without-but it is so! I have just left his chamber, and I should not be surprised if he did not live until morning." Further down the letter said-"It was as I anticipated, GREGORY <emph>is dead!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Dead!</emph> and I nothing but an Arch-Bishop!" he slowly ejaculated, as if discrediting such an unpalatable, unwelcome truth. "Dead! and I, who was to be his successor, a mere servant to do another's bidding!" he continued, while his<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5770-00000152"/> pallid brow, over which had gathered great drops of sweat, wrung from his proud, ambitious soul, by the total overthrow of the schemes he had so fondly cherished. Full well he knew Gregory's successor would not consider any promise made by the dead Pope, binding on him, and he might even think it unnecessary to remove the Papal Chair to America, or he might so long neglect its removal under the hope of retaining it in Catholic Europe, as to frustrate his plans altogether.</p> 
               <p>"Has it come to this?" he at last exclaimed, throwing from him the letter, and pacing the floor with angry strides; "Has it come to this! that I am thwarted at every turn? Who are these plebeians that dare stand in my path? Had they been obedient as became them, I should one year ago have been proclaimed Cardinal, and then my success would have been certain! But, instead, I am a paltry <emph>Arch-Bishop!</emph> and all is lost! Why was I so imbecile as to hesitate? Why did I not raise the Cross in open day at Philadelphia, and call the faithful of both sexes to follow me to victory! From thence I could have led them over the Union; and had I done so, there would have been none now to dispute my sway! I let the golden moments pass through a false policy, which spared the heretics-but has been my ruin!"</p> 
               <p>The storm in his breast lulled itself by its fury, and pausing before the table, he raised another letter bearing the same marks as the former, and he knew by these, the<pb n=""/> same hand had sent it. It said-"The Cardinals have been now in conclave five days, and still there is no Pope. Had you been a Cardinal, and here, your success would have been certain!"</p> 
               <p>It further remarked-</p> 
               <p>"The sixth day came-the hour passed-and no smoke arose, when the walls were torn away, and the imprisoned Cardinals led forth Cardinal MASTAI FERRETTI clothed in the Pontifical robes!"</p> 
               <p>"Ferretti, Pope! the most liberal of all the Cardinals! How ruinous; how suicidal to the throne of Christ's Vicar! Great Heaven! they might better have elected the lowest Priest in the Church than him. I know the man at heart is a plebeian. Lost! lost! and must I submit? Never! Never! I will be a Cardinal-but <emph>only</emph> that <emph>I may be Pope!</emph> Ferretti will be crushed by his own acts within a year, and then I will, by tendering him an asylum here, hasten the removal, and my own elevation.</p> 
               <p>"Happy thought! I know him and the Italians. He will soon be a fugitive, and as an exile the Americans will receive him, when they would hoot at him as a guest, or an emigrant. Once here, he dare no longer refuse to raise me to the rank I covet; and when possessed of it, I have no fears for the future."</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop's stormy brow became calm; his manner subdued, and he was again the dignified Prelate, with the mild beaming eye and studied suavity, for which<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC5770-00000153"/> he had been so much admired and imitated. Long he sat in silence marking out, with his perverted masterly intellect, his course for the future. At length he murmured, as if continuing a train of thought-</p> 
               <p>"Yes! I will go to Rome, under pretence of offering homage to the new Pope; but in reality to win his confidence, probe his intentions, and urge him to a policy that must, if pursued, lead to his overthrow, and the general rising of all Italian serfdom. Look well, oh, Ferretti! to your Tiara-for even now, a hand is held out to you in fellowship, and words of congratulation are uttered, while the brain is preparing snares to procure your overthrow!"</p> 
               <p>Taking another letter from the table which bore the Philadelphia post-office mark, he broke the seal, and read-</p> 
               <p>"Gaven, the Renegade, is dead. As you already know, I have had a spy on his path ever since he turned Renegade; but he has eluded me until yesterday, when my spy dressed as a Quaker, followed him out of the city, and by a cautious manuvre headed him, and struck him down with a loaded cane, on which he had pretended to lean by reason of infirmities. To prevent detection, he dragged him to, and placed him on a railroad track put a whisky bottle by his side, and left him. The best of it is, this morning's papers record a terrible accident of a drunken man being crushed into a shapless mass by the evening train, the conductor of which did not see the poor inebriate, on account of the intense darkness. Of course, no one was to blame."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>With a sickening sensation, the Arch-Bishop lighted this paper, and saw it reduced to ashes. Did it recall past crimes too vividly? Or, did he fear Gaven had learned from Sister Mary important secrets which he had had ample time to reveal to others, and which might one day cry aloud for vengeance? Or, what was it that this Gaven, now reduced to a hideous mass of corruption, and hurried away from human sight to a lonely, unknown grave-so revolting was the spectacle-that this proud ambitious man should sicken and turn pale at the mention of his name?</p> 
               <p>Months passed on, and Paul Gordon heard no more of Gaven, and the conviction fastened itself weekly upon him that he had at last fallen by the hand of his foes. He had often spoken of a doom he assured Paul certainly awaited him.</p> 
               <p>"I have," he would say, "a fearful array of crimes laid up against them, and I will teach them to quail at my name before they shall entrap me, for I know full well they will never desist until it is accomplished, and I am dead or in their power!"</p> 
               <p>Paul had often urged him to lay the facts in his possession before the tribunals of his country; but his invariable answer had always been-</p> 
               <p>"Were no blood on my own hands, it should be done! God forgive me! But the truth of all I know can never be revealed, although these monsters of iniquity escape by it<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5770-00000154"/> an outraged justice, and unavenged their victims still are slaughtered within their walls!"</p> 
               <p>"This is a wrong to our laws!" had been often urged; but to this he had replied, "Were I to communicate half I know to the civil authorities, perhaps, on the certificate of insanity from a Catholic Physician, acting under the directions of his Confessor, I might forever be chained within the walls of a mad-house, where the shrieks and howls of dethroned reason would never cease sounding in my ears, until I should become what they would be glad to have me-a maniac. One such case I knew in which a young girl escaping from a Nunnery where every feeling of her being had been outraged, sought the laws for protection, when her relatives came forward at the command of the unfeeling monster from whom she had fled, and affirmed that she had been disappointed in a love-affair which had dethroned her reason, and now she was a confirmed lunatic, and desired she might be sent to a madhouse, as they found it impossible to control her. She begged, prayed, and protested that all she had said was true. The officers were staggered, and called in physicians who, with wise looks and hearts obedient to their masters' nod, pronounced her doom, and she was dragged away while her murderer assured her relatives when she died, the Church would say masses for the repose of her soul gratis, in consideration for the faithfulness with which they<pb n=""/> had conformed to the first and greatest tenets of their faith-that of blind implicit <emph>obedience</emph> to her behests.</p> 
               <p>"This is monstrous! horrible! Good heavens! have others suffered like our lost Irene?" said Paul.</p> 
               <p>"You know what I told you of Cecelia Levering? I know where I found her suffering, nearly dying; and in attempting to escape, chose death rather than return to the <emph>tender</emph> mercies of her jailors. That she was the granddaughter and heiress of Levering I have no doubt; and that they deceived the old man, in order to secure the money, is equally as clear, and could we, by any means, secure the papers that prove her parentage, that Will which gave the money to the Church under false pretences, might be broken, and for want of direct heirs fall to the State."</p> 
               <p>Alas! even Gaven, with all his knowledge of the crooked paths, knew not that no Will existed-that what purported to be such was a vile forgery!</p> 
               <p>Paul could not mourn long for the probable fate of Gaven, for another calamity nearer home threatened a second time to bereave them, and make their hearthstone thrice desolate. The life of her who had nurtured him with a mother's love was slowly, surely wasting away. That first night of agony which her sister's child spent within the toils of the destroyer, planted a thorn in her own heart, from which it never recovered. The calmness of despair had settled upon her soul, sapping the fountain until it no longer yielded life to the body that imprisoned it. They<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5770-00000155"/> saw her wasting, dying; and had no hope, no consolation to give. When she stood by the grave that closed over the beautiful broken-hearted, she too knew it would soon close over her. As year after year went by, and she still hovered on the confines of eternity, the way grew beautiful to her, for beyond the gloom that enshrouded it, a radiant, prospect opened before her, where there should be no more sighing or grief; where tears should forever be wiped from all eyes; and, best of all, where brother should no longer hate or war against his brother.</p> 
               <p>Paul often looked upon her with an aching heart, wondering how soon her blood would cry out for vengeance against those who had planted the death blow in her heart. Mr. Connelly scarcely heeded it; perhaps he saw not the impending blow which was fast hastening its descent upon the defenceless partner of his sorrows; for though he had borne the great grief better than she, still he had, from the hour of her burial, moved around like one in a dream.</p> 
               <p>The expected, but still dreaded hour came at last; and she passed from life to death meekly, gently as her life had been. They laid her low by the side of Irene, and from thence Paul passed out into the world with a seared hardened heart and unrelenting hatred to the system that had desolated his once happy home, and sown death and dishonor on its hearthstone; and Mr. Connelly to wander a bowed, stricken man, around the ashes where reposed his<pb n=""/> blasted hopes and desolated home. The path was well trodden, and when the passers-by, looked upon his step, tottering with premature age, they whispered softly-"Ere long there will be another victim, whose blood will rise to the Heavens whence the great I AM has said-'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it.'"</p>

               <argument> 
                  <p>The peculiar condition of the Church at St. Louis, over which Father Francis presided-His continued absence-Anxiety of his charge-The Bishop informs them that he will never return again-Their regret-Father Benedict takes his place-More stringent measures-Attempts to wrest their Church property from them-Private Council held-The Bishop and Father Benedict secret themselves to listen to their proceedings-Indignation of the members-The Bishop's threats-He inflicts a blow on Mr. Dean-He is violently ejected-Mr. Dean's conduct approved-Legal proceedings commenced-The Bishop defeated-Jesuitism still at work-Its effects in Philadelphia-Trustees of the Holy Trinity Church imprisoned-Their Church taken from them-Indignation meeting in the Chinese Museum.</p> 
               </argument> 
               <p>THE flock so cruelly breaved of their shepherd at St. Louis, waited long, prayerfully and tearfully for his return. They at last grew impatient, and demanded him at the hands of the Bishop; but when they were told that he would return to them no more, they mourned and refused to be comforted by the cold, harsh toned stranger he offered them to supply their Pastor's place. Months rolled away, and their souls thirsted for the waters, and hungered for the bread of life. They felt the need of a guide to go before them, in order to see that they tarried not by the way. They needed not that the terrors of evil should be held up to their view, but that the joys of peace on earth and eternal life in the world to come, be kept before them.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>This was the state of feeling for which the Bishop had been waiting; for sooner or later he knew it would come. They had refused the man of his heart for a Pastor, and with smothered wrath he had left them; but, though they knew it not, <emph>he</emph> had not even for a day, lost sight of them-and when he saw that they longed for one to go before them, he again took to them with honeyed words, FATHER BENEDICT. With sore distrust they welcomed him, and he entered on his duties. Once installed, he commenced a series of pastoral visits; but his harsh manner and unfeeling ways, so differed from what they had been accustomed to, repressed the warm love which gushed forth to greet him, and when he chided them for want of due reverence to him, they received the rebuke meekly; but it rankled in their hearts. Father Francis, in all the years he had led them through green pasture, had never so rebuked them, and they interrogated their own hearts whether the blame was all their own. (See Note 95.)</p> 
               <p>He taunted them as heretics when they refused to give up their Bibles, which he who had been their Saviour, bade them keep and cherish as they valued their happiness here, and eternal life in the future world. Father Benedict bade them withdraw their children from the Public Schools, and when they imploringly pointed to their past lives, and deprecated such a life for their children, he insultingly told them, their past lives were better than their present! He accused them of robbing the Church's Treasury, to deck<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC5770-00000157"/> themselves in finery; for said he-"You never were accustomed to live and dress as you do now; therefore, it is unnecessary, and the money you thus spend belongs to the Church's treasury!" Father Francis had encouraged a plain but neat apparel as elevating the person in the scale of humanity. It gave rise to a dignity and manliness, which he sought to incite and foster among his flock. He had taught them to look on cleanliness as a cardinal virtue; but now, when those very traits were ridiculed and scorned as unnecessary in people of their station, they justly felt outraged, and murmured words in disapprobation of the pastor were heard, soft and low at first, but gradually gathered strength, until they reached the ears of the tyrant who had so trampled upon them.</p> 
               <p>Thus stood matters between them, when the Bishop instructed Father Benedict to see that the deeds of the Church property-then vested in the name of the communicants-should be transferred to him, to be held by him on behalf of the Pope of Rome, who alone had the right to the property vested in Catholic Churches in all nations of the earth. (See Note 96.)</p> 
               <p>"This," said the Bishop, "is the command of the Arch-Bishop, who received the instructions immediately from the Pope. It is a well understood fact, that our Catholics grow arrogant if allowed to accumulate property among themselves. It is impossible to retain the ascendancy over<pb n=""/> the people, unless they are kept in the station to which they were born." (See Note 97.)</p> 
               <p>Father Benedict received the mandate, assuring his Superior that it should be obeyed. Calling together the Trustees, he arrogantly lectured them on the virtue of obedience to Superiors in all things, and concluded by demanding, in peremptory tones, that the property now vested in the name of the Communicants, be transferred to its lawful owner-the Pope-in the name of the Bishop. It needed but this last act to arouse their smothered anger against him, and with words as coldly imperious as his own, they denied his right to make such a demand.</p> 
               <p>"Do you dare to dictate to your Superiors?" cried Father Benedict, in a rage. "This comes of the false teachings of a traitor to the Church!"</p> 
               <p>"It comes from a knowledge of our own rights as freemen!" returned Dean, the waterman, who had been spokesman for his brethren on that eventful day, when Father Francis was torn from them and conveyed-whither they knew not-but they had never divested their minds of the thought that his refusal to urge them to comply with the heartless, unfeeling demands of the Circular, that Father Benedict had since so annoyed them with, was connected with his disappearance.</p> 
               <p>"Your impudence is insufferable!" coolly retorted Father Benedict. "Be silent, sir, until you are commanded to speak!"</p> 
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC5770-00000158"/> 
               <p>Dean was never more surprised! He could not have answered had he been disposed to; but, as gradually the full bearing of those insolent words unfolded to him their import, it caused his cheek to crimson, his lips to compress and turn to an ashy hue, while his eyes grew brilliant in intensity, until his comrades trembled for the result of the storm they saw was raging within, and which he was endeavoring to control.</p> 
               <p>"This is unexpected, Father," said Mr. Curren, "and the duty we owe to the other members of this Church for bids us to act upon it without consulting them."</p> 
               <p>"Such a step is quite superfluous! They need know nothing of the matter whatever!"</p> 
               <p>"Nay, Father, it would be doing them a great wrong, to deed property held in trust for them to another-property they paid for by contributions from their hard earnings!" returned Curren, with spirit.</p> 
               <p>"This property, like all other Church property, belongs already to the great 'Corporate Body,' whose head is the Pope. Has not the head the right to the body? And is it well for a member of the body to set up a will against the head? Other Churches have laid their all at the Bishop's feet; why this resistance?" imperiously returned Father Benedict. (See Note 98.)</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Father; if the Head is so lost to all sense of what is right and just, as to command it to maim or destroy itself, and we resist because we have no right to comply,"<pb n=""/> returned Mr. Fisher, in a quiet, firm voice which he meant, however, should be a respectful one.</p> 
               <p>"I have not come to dispute the point with you, but to receive your compliance!" angrily retorted Father Benedict. "It is your Superior's place to command, and yours to obey!"</p> 
               <p>"My assent you shall never have!" said Mr. Dean, in a low, unyielding tone of defiance. (See Note 99.)</p> 
               <p>"By the Holy Virgin, we will see to that!" answered Father Benedict. "Know you not, I can hurl your souls to perdition for such contumacious behavior?"</p> 
               <p>With a sneer on his lips, Dean turned away, and consulted with several of the Trustees, and then said in a decisive tone-</p> 
               <p>"We have nothing further to say on the subject tonight. Meet us again in one week from to-day, and you shall know our decision."</p> 
               <p>"Decision? What insolence! You have no decision to make! The property belongs to the Church, and she will have her own! Think not to brave her displeasure! She can and will compel obedience to her behests!"</p> 
               <p>They adhered to their first decision of giving him no positive answer then, when, with bitter threats on his part, and angry, defiant ones on theirs, they parted. It had not been the first time they had separated in anger, and when they went out they repaired to the house of Dean, where, they sat until the night was far spent, in close<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC5770-00000159"/> conference in regard to the unheard-of audacious demands that had been made on them. When they separated, it was with the understanding of calling a meeting of the members to be held on the third day after, to which their Pastor was not to be admitted. It was to be a secret session, to take into consideration the character of these aggressive acts in all their bearings, and devise some means for their relief; for they daily felt how heavy the burthen was to bear which was now laid upon them.</p> 
               <p>The third evening they repaired to the Chapel where already the communicants had assembled, and closing the doors, Mr. Dean, in plain and unequivocal terms, laid the case before them. He said-</p> 
               <p>"Our troubles took their rise not with the coming of Father Benedict among us, but from the hour our beloved Father Francis, on this spot, read the commands of our Superiors, bidding us to depart from the pleasant paths in which we were walking. You remember, brethren, his Grace, the Bishop, suddenly came among us, and uttered words that made our souls recoil within our hearts. The grieved tearful expression of our beloved shepherd's eyes, as it then wandered over us, while the Bishop was speaking, lingers in my memory yet; and since he returned not to us again, I know his absence arises from his refusal to comply with such unreasonable demands. Then this Father Benedict came; but what has he done for us since he has been here but to raise dissension, embitter our hearts towards<pb n=""/> wards him, treating us as if we were machines to do his bidding? Had Father Francis come among us with manner and words like his, we should still have been what we were, and never have heard of a Saviour's death to redeem us! The light of Divine love would never have illumined our hearts; for we would have turned with scorn from his teachings.</p> 
               <p>"Father Francis taught us to love and obey the Bible as the word of God, and you as well as I, brethren, know the change it wrought in us. We have proved by the good which followed, that, the path he led us, was the right path, and very pleasent it was to walk therein. Father Benedict taunts us with heresies, for following this path, and tells us our Bibles are full of evil and will lead us to perdition. He commands us to destroy them; to cease practising the virtues we are taught; to let our children grow up in ignorance, for education was never intended for, and breeds evil among people of our station!</p> 
               <p>"Brethren, what is station? Are we not what we make ourselves? You all know what we were, and you see what we have made ourselves, by the aid of divine grace, and the precepts taught us by the man of God, whom I can never help thinking, was sent by our Heavenly Father among us. As we have advanced, so are we capable of advancing, and shall we retrogade because a man comes among us from whom we all turn with loathing, and bids us turn back? Should we not, rather press on to the reward<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5770-00000160"/> which we know by the infinite love in our hearts, awaits us if we faint not by the way?"</p> 
               <p>"I have heard," said Mr. Curren rising, after a few moments of breathless silence, "that there was a spirit of evil ever warring with the principle of right. If this be true, may not this Father Benedict be the embodied spirit of evil to war with the harmony and love within us; to turn us back to the iniquity from which our beloved pastor saved us? Father Francis often told us to never look down or back, but always up and onward. We have done so, and we have left far behind us the cheerless way whence we started, and we are now men, and brethren, we are freemen! What claims has Father Benedict on us, that he comes to us with insult and outrage? We owe him nothing, nor even the Church! What we have is our own, won by the labor of our arms, and let our arms defend it!"</p> 
               <p>"Aye, we will defend it!" was the hearty response that rose as one voice, from those assembled.</p> 
               <p>"Since this unhappy difficulty has arisen," said Mr. Fisher, "I have reflected much on what our real duties are. We all wish to do what is right, but no one will pretend to say it is right to do that which either debases the soul or body. How long, brethren, should we remain what we are, if we disobeyed the express commands of our Saviour? which we would do, if we refused to recognize the Bible as our guide! Our God would frown upon us, and we should fall back into darkness<pb n=""/> ness and error. Thank Heaven! we are freemen; and we have but to say the word, and this bad man leaves us for ever. Let us then do our duty; throw off all semblance of allegiance to Priest, Bishop or Pope! retain our Bibles; send our children to school, and procure another Pastor ourselves, a man after our own heart! Another Father Francis if possible, or even him, if we can find him. Brethren, I know not if this be heresy. If it is, the heretics way to heaven is very pleasant, and I for one, would continue to walk therein."</p> 
               <p>"It is our only way to return to the peace and happiness we knew while unmolested by the Bishop," said Mr. Dean, "and I, for one, assent to it. We only ask what we are willing to accord to all who do not agree with us-a freedom to worship God as the heart dictates, and liberty to pursue the path most congenial to our general welfare."</p> 
               <p>A stillness, deep and thrilling, now hung over them, but there was the light of awakened hope that this strife was soon to cease, flashing from their eyes, while the weather-beaten, upturned faces glowed with the manly, heartfelt awakening spirit of liberty, so new to them-yet not the less grateful-that circumstances had never before called it forth.</p> 
               <p>"Let those who are for throwing off all allegiance to the Priest, Bishop and Pope, rise up. It is necessary we should know who are for, and who are against us," said Mr. Dean, in a voice which indicated how earnestly he felt in the matter.</p> 
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC5770-00000161"/> 
               <p>"All! all of us!" they cried, as every man arose to his feet.</p> 
               <p>"Down! Down! every heretic of you; or I'll send your souls to purgatory, where you belong!" thundered the voice of the Bishop, hoarse with passion, from the sacred desk, behind which he had been concealed.</p> 
               <p>They started tremblingly for a moment at this sudden apparition; but quickly recovered themselves and stood firm and unyielding.</p> 
               <p>"Down! Down! I say!-you spawn of the earth! Dare you rebel against me, a Bishop, who holds even your lives as well as your souls in my hand!" And mad with rage, he came down the steps and approached them with a raised cane, followed by Father Benedict, who had concealed himself with his worthy coadjutor there, in order to spy on the people's proceedings.</p> 
               <p>"Brethren, be firm and stand to your rights!" cried Dean, folding his arms quietly on his brawny chest, as with unquailing eyes he awaited the approach of the Bishop.</p> 
               <p>"Dog of a heretic! Down with you!" shouted he, as he raised the cane over the head of Dean who, with unflinching eyes and a curl of scorn on his lip, cried-</p> 
               <p>"Never! for you! You are a disgrace to the cause you ought to cherish and protect!"</p> 
               <p>"You insolent viper, then, take that," and he brought his cane down on the shoulders of the waterman, who sprung on his antagonist like a bloodhound-caught him<pb n=""/> by the throat, and dragging him to the door, hurled him headlong into the street, as if he had been a loathsome reptile. Returning, he saw Father Benedict had thought proper to leave; and now they were, indeed alone, with an impassible breach between themselves and the Bishop.</p> 
               <p>Dean sat down and bowed his head on his breast. He had acted hastily, yet he could not help but think rightly. A feeling of bitterness weighed down his spirit, for now that his anger had passed, he feared he had outraged his brethren by ejecting in so violent a manner, their Bishop. Curren divined his thoughts, and said, as he laid his hand on his shoulder-</p> 
               <p>"You have acted justly, my brother; fear not, any one of us would have done the same. He merited the punishment his unchristian behavior has called down upon him."</p> 
               <p>"I see brethren," said Dean, humbly, "how hasty was the act that has forever placed a wide chasm between us. We now stand alone; yet I fully believe, it is for our welfare as Christians and freemen, that we do. There can never be any vitality, or freedom among us, if at any time, a stranger is allowed to come and dictate to us what we shall or shall not do; demanding of us the titles by which we hold our little property, and insult us for the laudable endeavor to raise ourselves and families above that station in which we were born. Let us act together as become Christians and freemen. We need prepare no answer to their demands; they have them already by a less honorable means. We<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC5770-00000162"/> will find a man like Father Francis, and one who, like us, acknowledges no allegiance but to his country and his God-then we shall again be happy, without fear of molestation."</p> 
               <p>To this they all assented, and when they separated not one regretted the breach between their little band and the Bishop, although they disliked the necessity that compelled them to so violent a measure. Here, they supposed it would end. Alas! they knew not the bitterness or weight of the hand they had raised against them!</p> 
               <p>Raising himself from where he had been so unceremoniously hurled by the indignant waterman, his Grace, the Bishop, wended his way to his princely abode, threatening vengeance against the heretics, who had forcibly expelled him. All that long night he sat with Father Benedict devising plans of revenge; and when the morning dawned, the two worthies instituted legal proceedings for the possession of the property vested in their chapel, on the ground that a Catholic Church could not hold property, except in fee from the Bishop, whose duty it was to retain it for their use, in the name of the Pope, to whom be longed all property vested in their Churches.</p> 
               <p>The trustees had not expected this; but they brought the question to an issue before the judicial tribunal, which confirmed them in their title, and the baffled Bishop retired from the field of contention, not daring to exhibit his chagrin, although he was heard to say as he left, that-</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Nothing could be accomplished in securing the Church property, until the secular power was in their own hands!"</p> 
               <p>Far different were the results of similar contentions for the same principle in other places; for, many times the Trustees were men of no just sense of right and wrong, and could be intimidated, their judgments perverted, and at the command of their Superiors, yielded their assent, and in the name of the communicants whom they represented, gave over their trust to swell the vast real estate already held in the name of a foreign Master. The communicants who had contributed from their little stores to build for themselves a house to worship in, often revolted when they found themselves heavily taxed for rent of the house they had built themselves; but it was now when they were betrayed, too late to be of avail, and they were forced to submit to the behests of their betrayers. Many, like those in St. Louis, threw off all semblance of allegiance to the monstrous system that endeavored to rob them, and choosing a guide to suit their own views, declared themselves independent of the Mother Church. (See Note 100.)</p> 
               <p>This was the case with the communicants of the "Holy Trinity Church," Philadelphia. And when the Trustees refused to submit to the Bishop, and betray their trust, suits were instituted to wrest it from their hands by the strong arm of the law. The communicants of the Church had entrusted their Trustees with the care of valuable property, purchased by their own money, and they dared<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC5770-00000163"/> not prove so recreant to every principle of honor and integrity, as to commit the great crime of yielding up what was not their own, but that which had been committed to their keeping by others.</p> 
               <p>The case came up for a judicial investigation. The Trustees rested their case solely on the communicant's right to the Church property paid for by their own hard earnings; while the Bishop based his title on Article III., of the Apostolic Canon, which says-</p> 
               <p>"Churches, and all their rights, belong to the authority of the Bishops. It is decreed that all Churches, with their possessions and titles, shall be in the possession of the Bishop, and shall always remain subject to his authority!" And of decree seventeen of the Plenary Council, which says-</p> 
               <p>"We warn all Priests who have the administrations of Churches, not to appoint Trustees in them without the authority of the Bishop, nor to permit the faithful to elect them, lest difficulties should arise to the free administration of them."</p> 
               <p>This canon and decree, passed by a foreign potentate for the government of Churches and Church properties, were set up in the Court against the rights of American citizens who, denying the claims of another to that which they had themselves purchased, trusted to the justice of their cause for a confirmation of their rights. Perhaps the canon of the Pope, as it was thrown in the balance against their legal<pb n=""/> rights, caused them to smile; for in the integrity of their hearts, they had never heard of the "price," and would have rebuked the one who had the hardihood to tell them that, in obedience to a master's hand, a Pope's Canon in America could be made of sufficient weight to wring from them the hard savings of the people vested in the "Holy Trinity Church!" (See Note 101.)</p> 
               <p>The decision came like a thunderbolt on Philadelphia! For, it said-"Obey your Bishop; for, although you have bought and paid for the Church, it is not yours; as, according to the Pope's Canon, all Church property shall be vested in the Bishops!"</p> 
               <p>"We cannot; nay, we will not, give up what is not ours to give-what we hold in trust for others!" was the reply to this strange and unrepublican decision.</p> 
               <p>"You must submit, or pay the penalty! The law has decided; you must obey!" Nay, a canon of the Pope decided!-nor is this the extent of his decisions! Other canons he has laid down as America's guide-will she submit?</p> 
               <p>The Trustees appealed, but the former decision was confirmed, and they, loathing the dishonor attending the betrayal of a trust, refused to submit to this decision also, and were dragged away to the dark, damp walls of the prison, reared for murderers and felons, into which they were thrown, because they, in the integrity of their hearts, could not commit a crime at the bidding of the Pope, although<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC5770-00000164"/> though his command was backed by the decision of the courts of justice of Republican America!</p> 
               <p>The names of Diffenbach, Steinmitz, Spiel, Langoff, Thomas, Fisher, Fiegel and Ruch, could not be shut within a felon's cell, and forth they went in trumpet-tones until they trembled on the tongue of every American Republican. They saw their brothers incarcerated in a dungeon, convicted by no law, nor accused of the breach of any law of their country, but by that of a canon of the Pope at Rome! Startled from their fancied security, man looked askance at his brother, not knowing how soon he might be arraigned for the breach of some decree and thrown into a dungeon, on the authority of a similar decision, based on some judicial canon or decree, and for their own protection they resolved to express their disapprobation by an indignation meeting, to be held at the Chinese Museum. This meeting, presided over by JACOB BROOM, was fraught with grave import by its earnest tone and manly rebuke to those who, in the name of justice, had given a wound to Liberty-the Goddess of America! Did not that rebuke cause these recreants to turn with horror from the deed, and wish for the waters of Lethe to wash out the stain, or had they never heard of the mark of Cain, that could not be obliterated until the fifth generation?</p> 
               <p>When the term for the incarceration of the Trustees had expired, they were met at the prison gates by the people, who greeted them with joy that they had, in contending<pb n=""/> for their rights, chosen a prison rather than dishonor. But their release gave them no abiding comfort; for they found that, in their absence the Church had been forcibly taken possession of, the papers seized, and the whole for which they had so nobly contended, wrested from their hands! The Pope, in the name of the Bishop, had triumphed, and the robbery was legally consummated!</p>

               </argument> 
               <p>IN her chamber at the Arch-Bishop's palace, lay Sister Geneve, on her couch of death! The day was fast fading, and already the shadows lengthened in the rays of the declining sun, as its last beams came through the open casement and rested on the peaceful, upturned brow of her who was breathing out her life, to return her soul whence it came. There were no traces of sorrow or grief on that pale brow, on which had already gathered the damps of death; but from her eyes shone the peace of soul that the world can neither give nor take away-the hope that bears the spirit safely through storms and tempests to the bosom of its God. A holy, trusting smile hovered round her mouth, while ever and anon, came forth soft strains of<pb n=""/> melody from the parted lips, for, even then, with the dark flood raging between her and the portals of eternity, she held communion with the seraphs waiting to bear hence the spirit that leaned so trustingly on the sacred promise, "Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Rest for the troubled soul! Rest for the weary spirit! The rest that shall be a shield from sin and sorrow on earth; and, when standing by the roaring, foaming waters of death, shall bear the immortal essence of our being triumphantly over danger to the portal of that eternity, which is vast, incomprehensible to mortals, but which envelopes the freed spirit with a halo of repose!</p> 
               <p>Enna, who had emerged from the chrysalis of childhood to womanhood, stood by her couch, with one thin transparent hand clasped in her rosy fingers, heightening the transparency by the contrast. There was a shade of premature care around the beautiful mouth of the young girl, which gave it an expression of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur</foreign> even in repose; her eyes, deep, fathomless and liquid, were dewy with sorrow, for her protectress-her guide-aye, her all-lay dying before her!</p> 
               <p>"Enna! my poor Enna!" murmured Geneve, as her clear, calm eyes rested on the sorrowing girl by her side.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Geneve! Dear Geneve! Why am I to be left alone! all alone, Geneve? for I am compromised by remaining here, and I shrink from going out alone into the<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5770-00000166"/> world, which looks inquiringly on me as I pass in and out of our home?"</p> 
               <p>"My poor, poor child! Is it possible, then, this is indeed no longer a place for you!" sighed the dying Geneve.</p> 
               <p>"I know not what I have done to provoke insult," pursued the young girl, "but I rarely go into the street, that I am not gazed at; and but a few days since the impertinence of a fellow became so insufferable, that I was obliged to take refuge in a store, from which I emerged half an hour after, to find him watching my egress, and when I would have hastened away, he stood in my path, and but for the strong arm of a gentleman near, I know not what would have become of me."</p> 
               <p>"You," said Geneve, as her breath came and went in labored throes, "have done nothing to provoke this, Enna; your shrinking purity could do nothing. It is as you say: you are compromised by remaining here. You are young and beautiful, Enna; the world, nor even yourself can ever know your claims to remain here, and it looks with suspicion and distrust upon your going and coming from this mansion. I have often spoken with the Arch-Bishop on this point, myself, Enna, for he as well as yourself, is compromised by it; but he refuses to part with you and find a home for you elsewhere. He loves you, Enna, with a protecting love, and would sacrifice every thing, but his overweening ambition to defend you from care, and to this<pb n=""/> ruling passion, I know not but that he would sacrifice you, if circumstances demanded it."</p> 
               <p>"I have known this, and have remained thus long, because I could not desert you, in your declining health. Ah, Geneve, the world will be very dark and lonely without one I can call my friend; for, in a few days I shall go hence forever, a waif, deserted by her kindred, to battle alone with life!"</p> 
               <p>"Deserted! Enna, no, never! Your mother was my early friend, and in dying gave you into mine and your father's arms, exacting a fearful oath of us that, you should never want a father's or a mother's care. I have kept my promise, even to this hour; but, alas! I can no longer!"</p> 
               <p>"And, my father?" cried the young girl, eagerly, "Does he yet live? Or, why is it that he thus deserts me?"</p> 
               <p>"Ask me not of him, Enna. I had hoped, before the grave closed over me, to be at liberty to unravel the mystery of your birth. But it must not be; the same cause still exists that first placed the ban upon it; and you must be content to know that no stain rests upon your parents, for I saw the ceremony that pronounced them one."</p> 
               <p>"Thank Heaven, for those words, Geneve! They have taken a load from my heart; and I can now go forth with the knowledge that, no one has a right to point the finger of scorn at me. I have feared otherwise, Geneve; for I<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5770-00000167"/> have seen much that has caused my cheeks to crimson, and my heart to rise in anger."</p> 
               <p>"I know it," gasped Geneve; "I have seen it all, my Enna; yet I dare not sanction the step you propose to take. The Arch-Bishop, I am sure, never will, and it will only cause dissension between you and the only protector which will be left you when I am gone!"</p> 
               <p>"Geneve! Dear Geneve! By the remembrance of my mother, tell me my father's name! I will go to him, and plead with him in the memory of that mother, and he cannot refuse to protect his child!"</p> 
               <p>"I can not, and dare not! Go to his Grace, kneel to him, he can, if he will. Come nearer, Enna; it is getting dark, I can no longer see you!"</p> 
               <p>"The rays of the setting sun are falling over you; it is not dark, Geneve; the chamber is flooded with light!"</p> 
               <p>"This is death! It comes! It is already here! Call his Grace, I would again say farewell to one I have never ceased to love with a sister's unchanging affection."</p> 
               <p>Enna, bowed with grief, rang the bell, and bade the servant call to the chamber of death the Arch-Bishop. He came and stood beside her, and parting back the auburn hair from that cold, cold brow, said, gently-</p> 
               <p>"Lillian, you are passing from death into life! I know you have chosen a different path from mine; but you will reach the goal! Have you aught to command me?"</p> 
               <p>Her lips moved, but her expiring breath refused utter<pb n=""/> ance, and laying the hand of Enna in that of the Arch-Bishop, she closed her own over them. A slight tremor convulsed her, and the freed soul was wafted to its Maker, as the last tints of the setting sun faded in the west.</p> 
               <p>"Geneve! Geneve! Take me with you! I am alone here; all alone!" groaned Enna, in the bitterness of her heart.</p> 
               <p>"Say not thus, poor child, I am still left you; and my power is strong to shield from evil," said the Arch-Bishop, as he drew her to him and clasped her lovingly to his heart.</p> 
               <p>The blood mounted to the young girl's brow; anger flashed from her eyes, as she haughtily disengaged herself from his arms! but the bitter words died on her lips, and, sobbing wildly, she laid her fair young head on the cold, inanimate breast of her dead protectress!</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop, astounded at the manner of Enna, for a moment stood irresolute; then laying his hand on the soft brown curls that clustered over her bowed head, he murmured in soft, winning tones-</p> 
               <p>"Enna! My Enna! Why do you turn so coldly from me? Have I ever done aught that could wound or distress you, during the long years you have been under my roof? Have I not been an indulgent guardian to you? You have gone and come when and where you pleased, professed what faith you pleased; and have I ever stood between you and your conscience or inclination?"</p> 
               <p>"Never, never! Yet I am very wretched, an outcast<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC5770-00000168"/> on the world-disowned by an only living parent, and compromising, by my presence, the very sanctuary of those who took pity on the nameless abandoned."</p> 
               <p>"Stop, Enna, stop! You know not what you say," cried the Arch-Bishop, his features convulsed with a wild agony by the accusing words of the sorrowful being before him.</p> 
               <p>Enna, roused from her grief by the tone more than the words of the Arch-Bishop, stifled the emotions in her own heart, and laying her hand on his own, said in a tone of cold decision-</p> 
               <p>"Your Grace mistakes; I have learned this within the hour, and uttered the truth when I said I was abandoned by an only parent whom I know still exists, but I know not where, or even his name. You are aware," she added, bitterly, "that I am simply Enna-nothing more! My father has even robbed me of what nature gave-a name!"</p> 
               <p>"Enna, oh, beloved, stricken child! Isabel is fearfully, cruelly avenged!" cried this man of one passion, to which all others had been made subservient by grasping ambition, whose greedy maw hourly claimed new victims to appease the all-consuming fire within it.</p> 
               <p>"That was my mother's name," continued Enna, in a cold, calm voice. "And, Geneve says, I am like her in all else but disposition-that is much like my father's; still he scorns his child, and he shall learn that the <emph>nameless outcast</emph> can live content without his aid, or even compromising<pb n=""/> mising her only earthly friend. Your Grace has been very kind to me, and I am grateful; but you need not be reminded that this has long been an unsuitable place for one like me, both for your own and for my sake; and now, that Geneve is no more, the necessity for my remaining will exist no longer than the hour that consigns her to the tomb!"</p> 
               <p>Long the Arch-Bishop strode the chamber of death; his brow corrugated with the warring of nature with that monster, ambition, which had so nearly eradicated the claims of every holier tie of his being. Time to him was annihilated, and he once again stood by the cold clay of the broken-hearted Isabel, whom he had wedded and thrust aside in secret, that nothing should stand between him and the distant future, the honors for which he panted, and to which he hoped to attain. He saw the lordly dignitaries receiving the homage of a god, while they commanded, and their vassals obeyed their mandates, even when they conflicted with all civil law, and he envied the petty despots. What mattered it that he was then the least among their many servants, a slave to do the bidding of the more favored ones? Could he not labor and bide his time until those, now clothed in purple robes, should tremble at his glance? It was accomplished; but at what a cost! for every step of the way was strewn with the victims' blood that had stood in his path, from hers whom he had thrust aside to die of a broken heart, to that of the patriots who<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5770-00000169"/> fell at Philadelphia before his shrine; and now, when another victim lay cold and dead before him, still another stood in his path, and with reason he cried-"Isabel, you are fearfully, cruelly avenged!"</p> 
               <p>Rousing himself from these visions of his chequered path, he turned where Enna had stood, but she had softly stolen from the room, and he was alone with the dead!</p> 
               <p>The hour passed that closed the grave over the dead-and the Arch-Bishop was still alone with his troubled thoughts. He had spent the days and nights in the endeavor to devise some means for the future of Enna, which should at once assign her the station she was capable of filling, and place her at ease as well as ensure her happiness. To send her to a Convent was out of the question. He knew too well what was within its walls, to take this step, and to enter many of the wealthy Catholic families as one of its members she had already refused to do, and he dared not urge it, for he saw, in that case, she could not be happy with her liberal Protestant views-and rigid virtues, which would be daily shocked by what she could not avoid seeing and hearing.</p> 
               <p>To place her alone in a boarding house, or set her up in an establishment by herself, with servants, was equally objectionable, as her loneliness, youth and beauty, would alike call down the heartless scrutiny of the world. The least evil to be chosen would be to remain where she was; but this she had refused, and he could no longer desire it<pb n=""/> if he could insure her safety and happiness elsewhere. Perplexed, he sent to Enna's room, requesting her to join him in the Library. Half an hour passed and he was becoming impatient, when the servant returned in trepidation, saying that the house and grounds had been searched for her, but she was not to be found. Hastening to her room, he found everything as if its occupant had stepped out; but, on raising her writing desk he found a note traced in well known characters. It said-</p>

               <p>How did he know that she had so appropriated the funds; or even where she was? What eye was upon her, to transmit all that occurred to that dread man whom she loved in childhood, and feared in womanhood? Her protectors were as much astonished as she; but, like her, could not conjecture whence the information was obtained! Alas! they had never heard of the St. Leopold, or if they had, would never have divined, that their "treasure" of a cook, as well as the nurse, chambermaid, and coachman, were so many spies on their movements.</p> 
               <p>Enna gradually became accustomed to her new mode of life, and thus two years passed away, when, with one of Mr. Bradford's ships which had been out months on a voyage, arrived the Supercargo, and in him Enna recognized the person who had saved her from insult two years before. The recognition was mutual, and they were introduced as Paul Gordon, and Enna; while she, poor girl, blushed, as the single name, the only one she knew she was entitled to, fell on her ears.</p> 
               <p>It was even so, Paul Gordon, when he went out from his desecrated hearthstone, hastened to this place, where he labored as a mechanic for Mr. Bradford, for three years; when he was sent as Supercargo to a foreign port, and discharging with ability his duties, had now returned from his second voyage.</p> 
               <p>Months past, and he daily visited the house of Mr. Bradford. Perhaps the nameless orphan drew him thither-<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC5770-00000172"/> it matters not; he went, and was aroused at last from a pleasant dream, by a summons to wait upon the Arch-Bishop at his palace.</p> 
               <p>"Tell your Master," returned Paul, haughtily, "if he has business with me, I can be found at my Hotel-I have none with him, that I should seek him!"</p> 
               <p>"Still imperious and headstrong!" muttered the Arch-Bishop, angrily. "The old grudge still rankles in his heart. Nevertheless, I must see and become friends with him; for I foresee how it will end; and, Enna, once wedded to an honorable man, I care not who or what be his faith or political bias, I shall free myself from a great anxiety."</p> 
               <p>Checking his anger at the gentlemanly indifference with which Paul Gordon received him, the Arch-Bishop, with that quiet, winning grace which he could so readily assume, sought to gain the confidence of the sturdy Republican; but when he saw himself so often foiled, he came at once to the point.</p> 
               <p>"You are," said he, "addressing a young lady residing at Mr. Bradford's. May I ask you, if it is your intention to wed her?"</p> 
               <p>"No, sir, you may not; unless you can show some authority for so doing," returned Paul coldly.</p> 
               <p>"I think I can," said the Arch-Bishop. "I was her guardian, and with my sister, since deceased, received her from the hands of her dying mother. I have watched over her from her infancy up to the present moment, and she is<pb n=""/> very dear to me. This is my authority for asking you the question."</p> 
               <p>Paul was thoughtful for a moment then said inquiringly, "Should such be my intention, and she would consent, what then?"</p> 
               <p>"It would have my cordial approbation. I would myself give her away to you, Paul Gordon; not that I approve of your past course, but because I have reason to think she prefers, nay, loves you; and I know you to be honorable, although misguided. That I have nothing to do with in this case, for Enna is a Protestant, as well as you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, man of crime!" cried Paul, "think you I would receive a bride at your hands? Hands stained with the life blood drawn from the bosom that warmed, fostered your wretched system into vitality?"</p> 
               <p>"Stay, Paul Gordon," cried the Arch-Bishop, "I have reasons for not wishing anger between us; but if you choose to forget what is due my station, do not that which is my due as a man. The differences between us are wholly political. I pray you do not make them personal."</p> 
               <p>"Your word of command that desolated our hearthstone, and crimsoned the gutters of Philadelphia with patriots' blood, created personal differences! Yes, sir, created a chasm over which you can never pass to the confidence of Americans again. I repeat it, sir, I would not receive even the peerless Enna at your hands; for the moment she consented<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5770-00000173"/> sented to hold faith with you, that hour would separate <emph>us</emph> for ever!"</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop left the presence of Paul Gordon, with anger in his heart; but for Enna's sake, he curbed the unruly passion and smothered it in its birth. A few months later an event occurred, of which he had been, from the first, apprized by his spies; but to whom no word was sent by those interested. The nameless waif, the accomplished Enna, was wedded to the young Republican, and the tie that bound them, sundered the last link ambition had left unbroken, between his heart and the ties nature had fought so manfully to find a resting place for within.</p>

               </argument> 
               <p>TEN years had now elapsed since the glittering prize-a Cardinal's hat-had been held out to the Arch-Bishop, tantalizing him with the gorgeousness and grandeur that lured him on-always on-but, when he stretched forth his hand to grasp it, like the ignis-fatuus-it eluded him, but still lured him on! He had visited the Pope at Rome six years before, when the vacillating occupant of the chair of St. Peter, reiterated the promises made him by Pope Gregory-but put the day of fulfilment afar off.</p> 
               <p>"America," said he, "is not yet worthy of so high a dignitary; and as for the removal of the Papal Chair to the New World, it must of necessity occur some day, but not in mine, so long as Austrian and French bayonets are used<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC5770-00000174"/> to intimidate the Roman Republicans. I have a horror for these Americans, and besides, your government is so imbecile as not to compel the masses to do homage to their superiors! Return to your post, use the Catholic power wisely, and some period this may occur, but not yet."</p> 
               <p>A few years more propped up by his Austrian and French soldiers, had taught the tyrant that a throne supported by foreign bayonets, was not so very desirable; and then, as his predecessor had done, he turned his eyes longingly towards America, and humbly asked the Arch-Bishop to prepare the way for his reception. He wrote-</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"I will send a Nuncio to the United States Government, and if he receives as cordial a welcome from them as did the block of marble I transmitted to fill a place in the monument to Washington, America will soon receive, on her soil, the representative of the Holy Apostles-Christ's Vicar on earth."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>The Nuncio came, clothed in all the pomp and circumstance of the mockery which had bewildered the monarchies of the Old World, and was received by the sturdy Repupublicans much as they would have received any other mountebank clothed in tinsel trappings to hide his want of manly virtues and honest principles. He came with his hands still reeking with the blood of Italy's patriots,<pb n=""/> and dripping with their warm life currents, raised them in pious horror, because their American brothers saw not his dignity and pomp-nothing but his ensanguined hands-at which patriots had sought, but without finding mercy.</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop was not prepared for the general discontent that arose at sight of the Pope's Legate, but he had in the last ten years, learned to detect a rising tempest, and to save his own ambitious schemes from being swept away in the gathering storm, as well as to show his displeasure that his claims at Rome had not been acknowledged, he withdrew privately from the scene until the tempest should have past away.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile the Pope's block of marble which he had sent to the United States' Government as a feeler, to test their sentiments in regard to himself, and which had been thankfully accepted, raised the ire of the people. They saw that beneath the ostensible object for which it had been sent, its real purpose was to propitiate and lull them into forgetfulness, and then re-enact the old story of the "Spider and the Fly."</p> 
               <p>The voice of the people arose in trumpet tones throughout the Union, saying-"Return the old tyrant his offering! From such a source, it will be a blot in the proud structure we are rearing!"</p> 
               <p>The Committee of the Monument smiled quietly, as this dissatisfaction of the people fell on their ears; but they<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC5770-00000175"/> heeded it not, and refused to return the Pope his due. And when they would have polluted the structure raised to Liberty's Defender, by a gift from a system that, for sixteen hundred years, had outraged her, they found nothing but a shapeless mass! Tyranny, typified in the marble, had shrank away abashed, and dissolved into fragments, before the voice of the people and Freedom's searching eye!</p> 
               <p>Bedini, the Pope's Nuncio, became appalled at the gathering storm, and fled a fugitive from city to city, where he had expected to be received with princely honors; and when he saw the torrent of indignation at his crimes rising around him, he took refuge in a mudscow which effectually protected him from the enraged populace, who else would have demanded at his hands atonement for the slaughtered Italian patriots. From his ignoble retreat, he passed out into the bay to a steamship, in which he hastened home to his Master, to relate how humiliating had been his reception; and the most galling of all, the Arch-Bishop who, if he would, might have led on the Catholics to the rescue of the Pope's Legate, fled at the rising of the storm, and left him to battle alone with a people whom he insulted by his presence.</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop returned to find a wider gulf yawning between him and the long desired goal. He felt that he had labored long and manfully to obtain his purpose; but still, it eluded his grasp. When he fled at the approach of his Master's Legate, he had done it in a disappointed<pb n=""/> ambition-one which his cooler judgment condemned. He dreaded to hear from his Master; for he fully expected a reproof for the slight he had put upon a man who stood so high in the estimation of the Pope as Bedini did. How greatly elated was he, however, when he received a letter from Rome, couched in the most affectionate terms, praising his efforts to establish the Apostles' throne in the New World, and bitterly censuring the laity for suffering his Legate to be driven from their shores in ignominy.</p>

                           <p>"Have you not, my beloved Son," wrote the Pope, "men and arms enough to have surrounded my Nuncio, and accompanied him from one end of that lawless land to the other, that he was forced to go alone and unannounced from city to city? Were I there, forsooth, these miserable beings would have probably treated me in the same manner, and dared to look upon the Vicar of God, as common clay, like themselves! Nevertheless, by the aid of the Holy Apostles-and the sword, if needs be-these savages must be taught deference to their Superiors. I grieved much that the climate so disagreed with you, that you were forced, in order to preserve your valuable health, to seek a more congenial one; for, I am convinced, had you been there, you could, by your marvellous influence, have held the savages in check. I have long known how deserving you were of a more exalted position than you occupy, and have fixed on the fall of 1854 to receive you<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC5770-00000176"/> into the College of Cardinals, among whom, though the last, you will by no means be the least. I have fixed upon this time, as my Nuncio in the short time he was among you, gathered sufficient information to warrant me to request the attendance at Rome of all the Prelates and Bishops, throughout the world, of influence and talent, sufficient for our purpose, at that time. I will forward a public invitation to this convocation of the high dignitaries of the Church to be held at the Quiurnal, and over which I shall myself preside, giving out that the question to be settled is the mooted one which has been a standing inquiry for calling convocations for the last four hundred years, and will probably be for the next four hundred years, should it serve to lull the heretics' suspicion of our real object, that length of time.</p>

               <p>With exultation, mingled with doubt as to the Pope's ultimate object in inviting the Bishops to Rome, he read this fatherly epistle. Only that he secured the prize he so long coveted, it mattered little whether the Pope had any other object in view or not, but he shrewdly suspected that foreign bayonets had become so many thorns in the Tiara they supported, which made the Chair of St. Peter as uncomfortable to sit in where it now was, as that piece of refined torture-the Chair in the Inquisition-whose invitarms, bearing the image of repose, wrought in gold and silver on its downy cushions, clasps the victim in its embrace<pb n=""/> brace, from which it is released a crushed, shapeless mass of what had been living, breathing humanity!</p> 
               <p>"Yes"-he said, as if communing with his thoughts aloud-"it must be so. Europe will soon throw off the power that has chained her down for five centuries. The Pope has found the day of reckoning fast approaching, and has concluded on what Gregory would have done five years ago, had he lived-removed the centre of the Church to a place of security, where the rising wrath of Europe's insulted millions could not sweep it forever from the earth. Why is it that man will not be contented to fill the station to which he is born; but must fret against his rulers until he breeds distrust, envy and malice which, in their turn, hatch a nest of vipers to vex the faithful? Mazzini, Garabaldi and Kossuth have done more to disturb the peace of Europe, than a century of Jesuits can do to ally the aroused passions of those who were born to obey-not to rule!"</p> 
               <p>Had he then forgotten his own humble origin, from which he had arisen slowly, steadily at first, as he was able by a giant will to crush back and trample on the generous promptings of his heart which, almost hourly arose before him to stem his onward course to a hollow ambition, but gradually with accelerated speed, as round after round he mounted above his fellows, until now he towered far above them, but was still unsatisfied with what he had gained; for although his power over his fellows was greater than that of any other man in the Union, it<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC5770-00000177"/> was insufficient to satisfy his ambition, so long as in old monarchical Europe arose one still above him, whose behests he was forced to obey; and he longed for the hour when the vacillating Pope should vacate his lofty seat, and he be called to occupy his place.</p> 
               <p>This private intimation from the Pope was closely followed by a public formal invitation to repair to Rome, to attend a convocation of Prelates and Cardinals, to decide upon the question so long at issue. The Arch-Bishop understood full well, the drift of this summons so long expected, and set about preparing to depart to claim his reward.</p> 
               <p>To leave the States now when his influence over the Churches was necessary to keep them from open insurrection to their Bishops' authority, was no easy task. He sent epistles to all the Bishops throughout the Union, stating his proposed absence, and laying down rules for their government until his return. A week elapsed when he received for reply that they had received orders to repair to Rome at the same time, and intended to avail themselves of the invitation of the Pope.</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop received this intimation with an undefined fear. What were they sent for, and without his knowledge? Was the Pope aware of his inordinate ambitious views, and intended to punish instead of reward him, when once in his power?</p> 
               <p>For days he brooded over this new state of affairs, which he<pb n=""/> feared would be a death-blow to his hopes when, in desperation at the prospect before him, he determined to call a Convocation of the Bishops in the United States, for the purpose of sifting their sentiments for the discovery of any secret intrigues which he began to fear were being carried on between them and his Holiness at Rome. Accordingly they were summoned, for the ostensible object of delegating their authority to such as could be trusted with discretionary power in their absence; but, in reality, to impress upon them his claims for advancement, and lay bare concealed intriguings to his injury. They all came at the command of their Superior, and on October 2, 1854, assembled a Convocation such as had not been witnessed before, since that called by him on New Year's day in 1844.</p> 
               <p>"The dangers that menaced our course in Europe," said the Arch-Bishop, "and the frustration of our deeply laid schemes here which have, undoubtedly, been the cause of our being summoned to Rome, at this time, demands that we as a body representing the Church in the United States, should have but one motive for our action, one principle for our guide, and, above all things, perfect confidence in the integrity of each other."</p> 
               <p>A murmur of approbation ran round the room as a sentiment so congenial to their own feelings fell on their ears.</p> 
               <p>"Europe," continued the Arch-Bishop, "will have their eyes on us; and we must be wary in all our movements<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC5770-00000178"/> ments, lest, in fraternizing with the Princes of Europe, we call down the indignation of Americans upon us, and when we return to our homes we shall be greeted by them as they received Bedini, Arch-Bishop of Thebes."</p> 
               <p>A shudder ran through his listeners at the name of the Nuncio, so fraught with bloody deeds! Did it remind them of those whom they had caused to perish of broken hearts, and persecutions; or, were they thinking of those who had fallen by the assassin's steel, or been slaughtered in the streets of their own cities while in the peaceful enjoyment of their rights as American citizens?</p> 
               <p>"You are aware," resumed the Arch-Bishop, "how we have all labored together for the fulfilment of the behests of our Master, as well as how futile have been many plans which have fallen abortive to the ground, after we had labored years to perfect them! I feel confident in asserting that, if this monster they call 'AMERICAN REPUBLICANISM,' had been choked in its birth, the United States would now have had a Catholic government. From this viper has arisen an offspring without a name, or body, but with a spirit noiseless and potent as the rays of the mid-summer sun, which penetrates our most secret plans, and lays open to the gaze of the world our stratagems before we can bring them to bear on the object for which they were intended! By forewarning it forearms; and all our efforts fall powerless or rebound upon ourselves. The causes that produce this effect, are so silent that they cannot be<pb n=""/> traced, and in vain have I used every effort to discover a mover in it?"</p> 
               <p>"Have you offered rewards, my Lord?" asked a quiet unobtrusive person who, with grave face, but a lurking gleam of satisfaction in his eyes, had listened attentively to the Arch-Bishop's wailings over the triumphs of his foes.</p> 
               <p>"Aye-that I have. One man I gave three thousand dollars to reveal their secrets; and after listening for full two hours to as improbable a tale as a fertile imagination could invent, of which no sentence bore any connection to the other, I found he was either insane or pretended to be so, and was glad enough to let him off with the money, on his promise to keep silent on the subject. Again, I offered another ten thousand dollars, to be paid down on the delivery of the By-Laws, Pass-words and Articles that bind them together; and after losing five thousand dollars in this speculation, with like success, have come to the conclusion that, no one knows any thing of them; that they have no organization or name, like other orders; in short, brethren-that they are 'KNOW-NOTHINGS!'"</p> 
               <p>The Arch-Bishop sat down amidst the applause of the Bishops, who had listened intently to his wise and logical conclusions-except the quiet member, whose face was turned from theirs; but, when he encountered their eyes, his were mild and calm, with perhaps, the exception of a shade of satisfaction too brilliant for which the occasion demanded.</p> 
               <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC5770-00000179"/> 
               <p>"We have done much," said another member, "to silence the press, and do away with heretical books; but, as they increase in numbers in corresponding ratio, our labors do not have the effect that could be desired. <unclear>Pat</unclear> Mullen and his men have done much to prevent the circulation of tracts and Bibles, as well as to punish the refractory who, in defiance of our commands, persisted in keeping their children in heretic schools. But the newspapers were beyond his reach, and had it not been for our friends in the Post Office, this growing evil would have, unchecked grown, and now been working our cause vast evil. Subscribers to them in thousands of instances have become tired of paying for what they never received, and withdrew their subscriptions. We need more such meritorious officers in the different branches of government, and then we may rest satisfied that our cause will, in the end, be triumphant!"</p> 
               <p>"In the end!" returned the Arch-Bishop, with a sneer, "will time stand still, that you or I may see it? I have waited too long already, and have grown impatient to see this fair heritage own its Master's sway, a Master all too indulgent for the good of his vassals."</p> 
               <p>"I fear you, my Lord, nor I, will ever see it," remarked the quiet member, in low, half audible tones.</p> 
               <p>"Ten years ago, my Lord, you said the same, and what was the result? If you have so soon forgotten, I can tell you of the Nation in arms; our own Catholics<pb n=""/> persecuted by their shepherds; pastors torn from the flocks they had rescued from degradation and cast into dungeons, where you, as well as I, know their fate; cities drenched in blood! and from the chaos of all this arose an American Genius that will for the next century, thwart our purposes."</p> 
               <p>"This is only the dark side of the picture-there is a brighter one, which will be revealed to you by the Pope when we arrive at Rome; and then you will see with me, cause to hope the day is not far distant!"</p> 
               <p>Settling a unity of action between themselves the Council adjourned, and the Arch-Bishop returned to his palace. Here the past, from his first career, came vividly before his mental vision; his labors that had served to elevate him to an Arch-Bishopric, where he had remained stationary for years; and when he had grown impatient of delay, the Pope had called him to assume the Cardinal's purple. But a few weeks would now elapse before he would be within a step of the throne, and should Pius IX., die, who as capable or available as himself to fill it? Should the Pope be now trifling with him-he clenched his hand passionately at the thought-a hand drenched in the blood of American patriots! "No," he murmured, "he dare not-or should he, I may teach him that, as once there were three Popes reigning at the same time, in modern times there might be two. The American Catholics would be no mean subjects to rule over; and if this Spirit without a<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC5770-00000180"/> body, these "Know-Nothings," can be silenced forever, it might be accomplished."</p> 
               <p>Thus mused the Arch-Bishop, whose devious ways led him where other men-even an Arnold and a Burr-feared to tread; and where he has pursued his object with an ardor deserving a better cause! For had he served his country with half the zeal he has served his foreign Master, his name would now have been enrolled beside that of a Washington, a Lafayette, a Clay and a Webster, on his country's escutcheon; and he would even now be shining far above his compeers. But in his efforts to be worshipped as a god, he has won the right to be called a traitor! AND THE END IS NOT YET.</p>

If necessary, the Church has resources. There is no sovereign on earth that counts so many subjects as Pius IX., independent of those petty States of Rome.

               <p>The following letter from a mother to her son who had<pb n=""/> left the communion of the Catholic Church for that of a Protestant one, illustrates the bigotry of this class of humanity-</p> 
               <p>"Son, your letter which has filled me with wonder and anxiety, has remained unanswered until now, and if I followed my own wishes, I should leave it unnoticed, since it is of so hellish a nature." She then proceeds as follows: "Who has been the devilish instrument at work to deceive your youthful mind? Damnation is their portion; the holy mother Mary curses them and you.</p> 
               <p>"Yes! and could I have known that a child of mine could ever have acted such a part as you have, by forsaking the only Church by which you can be saved, I would have taken a knife and have destroyed thee with my own hand at thy birth! Yes! I should then have done the Church a holy service. I would sooner have sunk into the grave myself, than have given birth to such an apostate. I damn the moment that I conceived thee, and the breasts that gave thee suck. If it were not for the holy Mary, I must sink under this overwhelming sorrow. Blessed Virgin! she comforts me, she encamps round about me; she is never absent from my side.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>My adorable priest is all in all to me,</emph> now that you have brought everlasting shame and disgrace upon me and my family, who, from their former position in life, and their high attainments in the holy Church, formed no mean object of respect and esteem. If you wilfully remain as<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC5770-00000185"/> you are, there is no hope for you; you are everlastingly damned!</p> 
               <p>"Until you renounce these sinful, damnable notions, call me no longer mother; I answer not to the name; and should you live to return, there is no home under your once paternal roof. No! my curse remains with you from this time forth."</p>

But that book which I send you is partly adulterated, partly interpolated, partly mutilated, in those parts of it which you and your fellows and masters cannot and could not understand, or which are opposed to that which you call faith. I ask you, therefore, that you would spare yourself the trouble of loaning books of that kind to people of my congregation.

               <p>At Champlain, N.

This was done in open day, and in the presence of many spectators. The President of the Bible Society in company with S.

               <p>"Nor is it over the ignorant rabble only that the priests wield such a fearful influence-men of intelligence, magistrates, and mayors, too, are in many places under this tyrannic sway, and this, not so much because they dread their power over the life to come, as because they know that by their influence with the multitude the priests can ruin their trade! If the mayor of a town is a grocer, or baker, he must obey the will of the priest, or his occupation is soon gone. The holy father plants himself at the altar when the multitude are there at mass-he does not in express terms say, "Don't buy your bread from that baker or your sugar from that grocer;" but he says, "Sure now, boys, that man is not of the right sort-wouldn't it be a nice thing to see the grass growing at his door?"<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC5770-00000187"/> and the boys understand well what this means, and the baker and grocer may leave the place, or his trade will leave him.</p>

Soon after, Mr. Welch brought me some medicine in a tumbler; the tumbler was two-thirds full.

I immediately began to feel strangely, and, while they were about me, sprinkling holy water on me, &amp;c., I lost my consciousness, and knew nothing until after dark, when I came to myself in a dark room, which I knew to be the same into which I went when mother took me to Mr. Lyndon's on the Wednesday evening previous.</p> 
               <p>"My mother was beside me, and I asked her where I was. She said I was safe. I inquired if I was in Mr. Lyndon's house.

While these gentlemen were speaking, several <emph>Irish carters</emph> came driving their carts into the lot, and forced their way through the crowd, nearly up to the speakers' stand, greatly annoying the people, and even exposing them to danger. Five or six of the loads were driven in, as near to the staging as the drivers could conveniently force their carts. These loads of dirt still lie upon the spot where they were<pb n=""/> then thrown. They were not needed there at that particular time; neither has any use been made of them since. Neither of them was brought in until the meeting had assembled, nor was one sent there after the assembly had dismissed! and when it is understood, that at the very time when these carters were committing this inexcusable outrage upon the meeting, there was assembled in the market house, running parallel with Second street, on the north side of Master street, and a few yards west of the school house, a number of Irishmen opposed to the meeting, armed with fire-arms and other offensive weapons, none can for an instant doubt that these carters were sent there for the purpose of provoking an attack upon themselves, and of thus furnishing a plausible excuse for an assault in return upon the meeting, on the part of their friends in the market house and the surrounding buildings. There was evidently in all this a cunningly devised plan for the perpetration of a premeditated outrage, for the consummation of which the most fiendish preparation had been made."

It increased with rapidity after once under way, and dense masses of smoke curled out from every window. In a few minutes the flames reached the belfry, and burst out from the upper windows in broad sheets. The whole steeple was soon wrapt in the devouring element, and presented a terrific aspect. The Chapel clock struck ten while the fire was raging in its greatest fury. At twenty minutes past ten o'clock the Cross which surmounted the steeple, and which remained unhurt, fell with a loud crash, amid the plaudits of a large portion of the spectators."-<title>See Reports of Riots.</title>

When you have done thus, turn them out, or suspend them on pretence of misbehavior, by which their places are forfeited, and they subject to what judgment you please to give upon them. Then you must form a 'camp' that must consist of none but Catholics; this will make the heretics 'heartless,' and conclude all means of relief and recovery are gone. And, lastly, take the short and the best way, which is, to surprise the heretics on a sudden; and to encourage the zealous Catholics, 'let them sacrifice all, and wash their hands in their blood,' which will be an acceptable offering to God.
