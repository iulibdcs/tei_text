ARTICLE FIRST. Formation of a Regiment. "VIOLETTA, I have just received a letter from my niece, and look for her here on the 7 o'clock train this evening." Mrs. Lieutenant Bobaline opened her large brown eyes- uncommonly wide in reply to her husband. There was a little fluttering in her throat, and she asked "Who?  "Did I not mention it to you.? A letter came some months ago from my sister in San Francisco, saying her eldest daughter would like to visit us. I answered it im- mediately, and told her to come, and had nearly forgotten the affair, when yesterday's mail brought the news, that she will be here this evening, probably." A pause :- rather embarrassing to the placid mind of Lieutenant Bobaline, while inditing a letter of importance, and he glanced anxiously at his beautiful wife, adding "I thought it quite providential, as I am to be away from you so long, and was sorry to leave you alone." His voice grew very tender. Violetta smiled, and he was encouraged to proceed. Isagone will be society for you!" He said briskly. i"What is her name? ' "Isagone Smith." "Ha! ha I what?" broke nervously from the lady. "Isagone Smith! I don't 'see anything so very funny in it." He said gravely.    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6558-00000006"/> 128     TTactics; or, "Oh, Adelbert! Isagone Smith not funny?" and she smothered something between a sob and a little scream, in her handkerchief. Lieutenant Bobaline though usually invulnerable to the sly shafts of his pretty wife, now looked wounded and left the room. Mrs. Bobaline was very greatly astonished at the coolness, as she thought, of her lord's announcement of such shocking news, for she was quite unprepared for the presence of such a stranger in her family. Mrs. Smith was the only sister of Lieutenant Bobaline, from whom he had been separated for many years. The chord so long silent, vibrated at the first touch, and he was almost childish in his desire to see his sister's daughlter. He had often spoken of this sister to his young wife, but never of his niece, because he knew nothing about her. Mrs. Smith married while very young, a restless, enterpris- ing man; consequently he was scarcely at home in one lo- cality, before he bore her away to antipodal regions, till at last he left her a widow, in comfortable circumstances, in the gold country. Lieutenant Bobaline had never seen her since he was a boy. His father and mother died before he was old enough to choose a profession for himself; but lie was given to the care of a maternal uncle, who brought him up in a very thorough manner, and procured him an appointment at West Point. The letter concerning Isa- gone was the first intelligence he had had, in many years, from his sister, and thus it came to pass, that the gay mar- ried belle at West Point, llad lived, and lost the pleasure of hearing of such a funny name as Isagone Smith. Several hours later, Mrs. Bobaline sat at the parlor win- dow, looking out on the mist and rain, when the omnibus drove to the hotel door. A slight figure emerged from it, and the gleaming of the hall lamp revealed a lady in a travelling suit of green, and a straw hat drawn tightly down with a green veil. Lieutenant Bobaline stepped hasti- ly forward. "Isagone?" "Yes, uncle!" said a low voice.   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.      13 He kissed her, and drawing her arm affectionately through his, led her into the hall, and up stairs into his own rooms. The crowded hall and parlors, quite stunned the young girl; and when she was shown into a room lighted only by a coal fire, and found herself alone, she sank on a chair in front of the grate, whose glowing coals threw the rosiest of tints over the pleasant apartment. Nearly benumbed with cold and fatigue, she sat staring into the fire slowly pulling off her gloves, when pattering feet and a glare of light, set her heart in wild commotion, she so dreaded to see her aunt. Lieutenant Bobaline handed his lady in, in a ceremonious manner "This is Isagone; Mrs. Bobaline.  Kiss your aunt, Isagone, and be a good little girl to her, as I am or- dered away immediately, and you must be her guardian angel till I return." Miss Smith timidly touched the delicate cheek, and very gently squeezed the tiny finger tips Madam offered her. Mrs. Bobaline looked curiously at the shrinking girl, as she unbonneted, and was secretly pleased to see only a meek little face, with a pink sea-shell complexion, quite a contrast to her own brilliant style. Mr. Bobaline assisted his niece in a business manner, to show that she was welcome, while his wife walked the floor like an actress, or hurried about the room in an aim- less way wondering what that little " angel " was sent just now for; she had not reckoned on being at all lonely, she was in no need of a " guardian angel," or of a spy on her every act, either. She sat down and looked appealing- ly at her husband. He understood her look. "Adelbert, am I expected to stay up here all the eve- ning and entertain this child?" His conjugal heart was touched, and he said "Viola dearest, order some supper up here for Isagone, as she is weary, and then she can re- tire when she pleases." Viola was delighted, and descended the stairs with a light step, glad to escape even for a short    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6558-00000007"/> "         Tactics; or, time from her own thoughts on this new and unwelcome responsibility. Poor Mrs. Bobaline, the evening is gone,- and uwhere is the parley of the soul, she had promised herself? The evening was gone,- and she had only once thought of the little intruder into her pretty boudoir, and her kind lord whom she had left so abruptly to amuse the rural maiden, as she mentally denominated Isagone - smiling to think she should certainly find no rival in her. The saloon was a brilliant scene, there was music, and dancing, and great merriment, but Viola's eyes roved out of windows, and doors; - she had been "' cracking her eye-strings," to catch a glimpse of one, who was not giv- ing a thought to her, "So fondly we ourselves deceive, And empty hopes pursue ; Though false to others we believe They will to us prove true." The foot-steps she listened for came not. Her fancy had taken the reins, - not nice in a dignified, high-bred wife, to allow it. She often boasted, 6" my husband far outshines every other officer on the post, in feature, form, and soul." Yes, but Mrs. Eve, you have been strolling out at eye-gate, and tasted the sweets of flattery,- pois- onous sweets!  Ah, Lieutenant Bobaline ' your roman- tic Viola had listened to your low thrilling tones, and high thrilling sentiments, until her warm young imagination blad veiled her Mars in a luminous zone, Awhich you had dissolved by becoming a little too matter-of-fact - a little matter too soon, - when once the possession of the coveted object was " a fait accompli!" Why not have permitted the bright tissue to screen the irregular and variable spots of La Vie by its varyving brilliancy? Mrs. Bobaline sought her own room, with a sick heart - -weary with self-condemnation, and the humiliation that follows it. She stopped at her own door, and wished that Isagone was gone to her mother, safely, snugly, lodged in   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,     15 her maternal arms, in San Francisco - nothing wicked in that. Alack! there she was - incarnate! She had retired "4 when she pleased " and was now sledping - timorously - as if conscious that unloving eyes rested on her face, and a little double-and-twisted sigh escaped through her parted lips, - then came a light over her face - a smiling, speaking look, as if she were back again in the nest-full of warm young hearts, throbbing with kindred love for her. Alas, they were far away! and would wait her -coming for many a weady day. Mrs. Bobaline gazed long and curiously at the fair childish face, then softly turning, saw four or five trunks piled up in the room. "What in the world can this child have in these trunks?  How long can she be thinking of staying,"' she queried. She quietly left the room, closed her own door, and sat down to wonder. Wonder first. Had any one in the world been as miserable that evening as she thought herself? Wonder second. Where had every body been?--to her the whole house was empty. Wonder third. Why did Lieutenant Mera seem to be laughing at her? Wonder fourth. What did Lieutenant Mera know about Miss Smith? He had asked if she had arrived. But sleep stole in and closed her wondering eyes, and smoothed her polished brow.    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6558-00000008"/> 16          Tactics sor, ARTICLE SECOND. Posts of Officers. IN a room in the west tower of "Barracks," lay an of- ficer asleep. His head was resting on his dog, a hound of great size and beauty. Under him was a white bear-skin robe thrown on the floor. His repose was the fading of a waking revery into a soft dream,-a delicious unconcious- ness and forgetfulness of those unpleasant intruders called compunctions, which usually gave color to his day-dreams - not always rainbow-hued. He thought he was weary -yes, he was weary -of a hollow-hearted world. Was he less hollow-hearted? Weary of aspirations unrealized -after Fame - the cheat! After Virtue, " one of the worshippers of whom, he was not which," a lady he would not make one sacrifice to woo - after the u" ignis fatuus, happiness," as he growled many times a day. Yes, he was tired - of society, whose flatteries sickened him, as sweets cloy the appetite of the child. Society, false to all its promises, and stealing that which it cannot give again - peace of mind. , Society, that polished horde, Formed of two mighty tribes, The bores, and bored." He was weary, weary of solitude--and-himself. Who could read this in the satirical curl on the lip of Lieutenant Saberin? In his careless indifferent morning carol  , To ladies' eyes a round, boys, We can't refuse, we can't refuse; Tho' bright eyes so abound, boys, 'Tis hard to. choose, 'tis hard to choose!"   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.      17 In his princely manner to the great world, in his gra- cious deferential bearing where he most despised -in his apparent self-forgetfulness, and abandon, at the nightly rev- els of the officers. Among these he was styled " a splen- did fellow!" The ladies flattered, and caressed him. In short all the world spoiled Lieutenant Saberin. His rooms bore witness to this. Every niche, was filled with rare gifts he had graciously accepted; curiously carved- camp- chest, and buffet, Bohemian glass, Dresden china, caps and slippers--quite enough for a Chinese museum. Books, papers, letters, gloves, pipes, tobacco, fresh and faded flowers, made a tout-ensemble quite irresistible to the bachelor officers. Now, the grate was heaped with bright red coals, im- parting cheerfulness to the room on this chilly May after- noon, and casting a hue, rich and golden, over the light brown hound, and dark brown head of the officer, that rested on the neck of the dog. Over the mantle-piece hung a painting of a scene in Florida, on the shelf below a pencilling of his dog, a cigar-case, a pair of spurs, a bunch of faded flowers, Weimer, his man, had held more sacred than his master-lifting and carefully replacing them every time he dusted - where more than a month ago, they were thrown, after a party, without one thought tothe giver, though so humbly begged for with vows to keep them always; and they were kept longer than most flowers are under like circumstances. The sleeper was aroused by a fierce growl from his dog. "Be quiet Burns!" came in just as fierce a growl from the round white throat, that could utter such touch- ingly tender tones. The door was opened. "Hallo! Did I awaken you, Saberin? I declare, I can always tell when you are asleep, by the growling of Burns, twice as fierce as usual, which is quite superflu- ous!  The speaker, a short,dark-eyed, and dark-hued, person,    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6558-00000009"/> 18         Tactics; or, with a most dignified air, took a slow march across the room to the fire, turned, and surveyed Saberin. i Not a bad picture, old fellow! Why don't you be done in that style? The Professor could turn you to some account then!  Call it Fidelity and Infidelity. Would not Madame B. send to Florida to " papa" for a cool thousand to secure the gem? Ha! ha!" Saberin stretched himself--patted Burns, and arose. After licghting his pipe, he seated himself, elevated his heels on the table, "On the same line, as near each other, as the conformation of the man would permit, feet turned out equally, and forming with each other something less than a right angle." "' Take a cigar, Mera ; and tell one if you think there is a possibility of getting a few days' leave? I am con- foundedly tired of this place, and everything in it-- ex- cept Burns," and he pulled the ears of the affectionate creature, who was fawning on him. '"The deuce! Saberin blue? that's a rich joke! I did not know you thought the worlds, ' and all that in them is,' of enough consequence, to induce you to shorten, or prolong, one of those lovely whiffs! Is Miss Kilman- segg unkind? Never mind, let's sing, "Ach, Gretchen, mein taubchen," and only light up one taper at a time. Lieutenant Saberin sat with closed eyes like one in a trance. Lieutenant Mera resumed, "Mrs. Captain Morton, gives a party next week, what would she do without you? She would certainly postpone it indefinitely; and Miss Dora McFlimsey stands ready to dance her feet off, if you will only encourage her: and- and- oh no we'll never mention her!' I'll just toast the bright-eyed one, in some of your 1776." And he rose and went to the buffet, poured out some brandy-- raised it to his lips, and said, " here's to He stopped"-- "Jack was embarrassed, never hero more, and, as he knew not what td say, he swore." It might have been the lack of a ready toast, or was it only the Indian hue of the rich southern blood that   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,     19 coursed in his veins? Very dark he looked, as the dark words fell from his compressed lips. So Lieutenant Sabe- ine thought,-- (not said) - as he rose. "I am going to get my leave to-night, if I can, and I will go to-morrow to the city. Will you walk round to the Colonel's with me?" and he regarded Lieutenant Mera as if he thought him drunk, or crazy. "Certainly, certainly, Saberin-- but t'were better not to go, man! Bobaline expects his niece to-night, he told me, and we can happen into the parlor, and play a game of Boston, and see what she is like."  Lieutenant Saberin drew his brows together to make Lieutenant Mera out. He had never seen him excited as 0 he seemed to-night. Lieutenant Mera usually so placid! What had come over the man! His loss of toast and tem- per- could he be jealous of him about Mrs. Bobaline? He sneered at the thought. Lieutenant Saberin had known Mrs. Bobaline when a Florida belle. Lieutenant Me- ra, and he, were ordered at the'same time, to a post where her father, a surgeon in the army, was stationed. She was then engaged to the good practical man she afterward married, but, " the trail of the serpent," must glisten on the pansies, and heliotropes, and where the flower-of-love lies-bleeding, in that Eden too. The handsome Lieuten- ^ ant Saberin arrived, and she fell in love, at first sight. He was equally smitten, and hunted, fished, rode, and walked with her, enjoying her wit and beauty greatly. She was-in love with him then, and now that she showed such marked preference for his society, had he not a per- fect right to be polite to her? He tore the bit of cigar in his fingers, to pieces, but Lieutenant Mera who stood look- ing at him, little dreamed what was passing in his mind. He frowned and curled his lips. He would have nBae of Lieutenant Mera's interference - and he would give him trouble the first lady he saw him take a fancy to. Such were his amiable thoughts. He turned suddenly on his heel, they left the room together, and walked in silence to tile Colonel's door. He obtained a leave, and parting 'from    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6558-00000010"/> 20   -Tactics; or, Mera, said gaily, as if in answer to the proposition he had made before they came out, "I thank you, Mera, I'll leave Madam Bobaline, and Miss what's her name--to vour tender mercies,--deal gently." Lieutenant Mera looked as if he would like to demolish him--but he did not. Lieutenant Saberin turned his sweetest smile on him, as le said, good-night! *b *C   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     21 ARTICLE THRD. Posts of Field Officers. "EUTENANT Saberin, in order to keep away from Lieutenant Mera " cut tea," and going to his room, sat down to plan what he would do in the city. He drew his vade mecum, as he called his porte monnaie, from his pocket to make an entry, when out fell a lovely little note, he had received that morning. It was written in a lovely little hand. Lieutenant Saberin had been for years rath- er in the flowery toils of a very sweet village maiden-- she had been a schoolmate of his, when he was a beauti- ful ingeAuous boy. Now, he would consider such a man as he, too stupendous a sacrifice at such a shrine. He could not afford to marry so recklessly, though he loved her- heaven only knew how dearly! and regretted the necessity of such a course, but "( was it not kinder to gradually drop the correspondence between them?" and she was too delicate, had too much pride to annoy him He had gently checked her warmth by not writing to her, but within the past few months, some sweet little pieces of poetry had come to him through the mail, in which, though prettily disguised, he could trace the graceful Italian hand he had so often seen before. Yes, scores of pretty note- lets had he carried home in his book-satchel, when happi- ness put wing on his little heels. Let us read over Lieutenant Saberin's shoulder. It has no signature-within lies the minnie ball! He glanced at the note and examined his pockets for one he had received a month ago - but as it was only poetry -    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6558-00000011"/> 22            Tactics; or, he did not spend his time reading it - now, he wished to compare notes. TO LIEUTENANT SABERIN    OE   WEST POINT, *Na-gah-moo! my lodge is lonely! The night wind's whisper in the pines Sings to me only! No joy is mine, Dear, Na-gah-moo! Na-gah- moo! my sweet voiced lover, Spring's soft wind, And love-notes hover O'er tMe-Me's mind, For Na-gah-moo! Na-gah-moo! my lodge is lonely! No love-lit eye Warms Me-Me! only The watch-dog's cry, Howls, Na-gah-moo. Lieutenant Saberin    paused, and the words of one of her songs, came to his mind. "As he pauses awhile in the hush of some hour, Its tones will come o'er him, and prove That the strife of the world cannot smother the power Of the song that breathes ever of love! Still love!" A great round tear lay like a diamond on the cheek of the calculating man of the world.   He unfolded the last note, for there was something very delightful, and fascina- ting, in the new sensations he was experiencing - some- thing akin to the pleasing pain the pilgrim   feels, when do- ing penance for his sins, he opened the second note. Suddenly, loud voices were heard on the stairs, giving . sign that his sanctum  was invaded.   He deliberately fold- ed the notes, put them into his pocket, and was sleeping in his chair. * Na-gah-moo, the Indian for 6 sweet-voice." t Indian name for " dove."   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,      23 ARTICLE   FOURTH. Regimental staff. FOUR or five officers, entered Lieutenant Saberin's room, all laughing and talking at once. He looked up pleasantly, and vowed he had pined for them, for the last three hours. Would they help themselves to seats, etc., or give him the extreme pleasure of helping them. They would help themselves, to whatever his poor quar- ters afforded. Lieutenant Alton, " a sweet young officer," as the la dies called him, walked to the cigar-case, took a cigar- lighted it, and sat down. Lieutenant Storme, set himself to do the honors of the toddy-glasses. Lieutenant Mera, leaned on the mantle-piece, and looked at the Florida scene. Lieutenant Alton gave two or three whiffs, and address- ed Lieutenant Saberin. "I can tell you we have had a stunning time this evening, at Tutes The youngr ladies are charnming. That Miss Nora Kearney, Storme, that you stormed, is a perfect little beauty; and my girl is tre- men-dous!

He would like to see the "1 Indian Princess"' Lieutenaint Ainb r-lt liad so generously brought into his clutches! The faistidious Lieutenant curled his lips, and then his moustache. iHe must not fail! conqueror-like, this must be a plumed vic- tory. So we find him at Warnock's, before lie goes to the hotel. Here he met Lieutenant Ambert, and after chat- tiz. awhile, they repaired thither. When left by his friend, to bring down the ladies, Lieu- tenant Saberin paraded before the mirror, surveyin6g his fine person with wonldrous self-complacency. Will the - ' Indian princess " admire him as much as he admires hm- -elf? He thought she would. Not a doubt clouded the radiant face. They came at last.

Like a fine soldier, the gallant Lieutenant made a grace- ful retreat, and was immediately promoted to the post of monopolizer general, by his admiring friend Ambert, while in her heart's judgment-hall the young girl pronounced him mighty nice l On Monday morning, when Lieutenant Saberin was compelled to part with Gipsy, as he lovingly called her, he would have given his commission to linger at her side. He told her how happy he had been in her society -that lie could never forget ; that she looked happy by his side," and "4 woulded they had never met." Gipsy told him she should cry when he was gone,- she was homesick at the very thought. Homesick! he was heart-sick, would go back only to live these precious moments over and over again, till he got his leave in June. 1"And what will you do then? Will I not see you again?"

He, (sorrowfully) "I was bold enough to hope, I might ask one more question, before we part - perhaps, forever; but after that, if it cost me the ' cherished hope of years,' I could not ask it." His tones were low, and sad. Gipsy would hlave given all her worldly goods, to know wlhat he was about to ask! He adroitly turned the sub- ject, not having any question to propound, he preferred giving scope to her imagination - well knowing the silly little head would balance the account in his favor.

He raised his eyes to hers. Scarcely less bright than the radiant gem he was admiring so undisguisedly, and caress- ing so tenderly, were the flashing eyes she raised to his, saying, "Lieutenant Saberin, you must be at West Point, or I will not go," and taking the ring from her finger, she placed it on his- -" and return this to mie then!" she said with a pleading look.

"That is all you need say!" replied the pitiless Caesar; and lie stole a very respectful look from the gem he was turning on his finger to catch the stars of fire in its depths, revealed by the light of the gas above his head, to tlhe loving child-like face, and felt that he could lay him down and die for her.

He wrote a letter to Miss Pauline, a love letter of tile most practical description, all that she could desire. He spoke of army life-lie would not expect ler to brave any of its dangers or hardships. She should be the bright particular star, that through all should guide him on to immortality and famne! He had had fancies, but be- side the deep, enduring impression shle had made upon his soul, they became aversions--here the ink paled to an unearthly hue, and "the lights in the chamber burnt blue!" blue as the eyes of one of those fanceies,- and strangely enough he thought of those blue eyes, and won- dered if Pauline would love him as she had donle. He did not doubt his predominatingr love for Pauline, blut would shle love. Yes, he thought shle wouldl; and- lie glanced at the glittering star on his little finger.

Desirous of   Cupid in Sl!oulder Straps.      33 pleasing her aunt, she bedecked herself quite bravely, a la San Francisco. . Blue Canton crepe dress, rich lace on lier neck and arms, a wreath of pearls and garnets, ar- ranged in exquisite sprays, entwined in her ligllt-brownl curls, were gathered like a cor3net on the top of lher hlead. Quite abashed at the pretty face and figure shle saw re- flected in her aunt's cheval-glass, she trembled at the thoug(rlt of venturing alone, to encounter the multitude of eyes, in everyr spot outside her chamber door. Tile hlouse seemed to the terrified girl, one vast multiplyinc glass, eyes, eyes - everywhere.  She ventured as far as the stair-case and peered over the balustrade, listening to the gay voices and then on tiptoe returned to her cell, as she called it. She wearied herself reading, and rememberingc her aunt's request, ventured boldly to the foot of the staircase. Slhe could get no further, but stood leaning against the wall, till she had attracted every eye -f from sheer waint of nerve to move. Some giggled, and all scanned her curiously.

And she gracefullly led the way through the hall, to Isagone's side. 1"Is - Hone dealr, allo(w me to present my friends. Mr. White, Mr. Brown, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Smith!" The fastidious lady could not draw the slow length of Isacone's quaint name out of her dainty mouth, and inwardly applauded her quickness of wit, in substitutinog the beautiful diminutive for it. "Ione, my dear, I think Cadet Smith must be a rela- tive of vours! Having the same name."  This she ad- ded, to put the young gf irl a little at her ease, as she was truly appalled at finding herself surrounded by so many gentlemen in grey. Cadet Smith said, nothing would give him more pleas- ure than to trace the relationship, and although her face became crimson at mention of her name, that had never been her admiration, Isagone was not sorry to find it be- longed to the handsomest and most elegant of her aunt's admirers, and she thought they must be very smart, to be tolerated by her superb ladyship.

They did not joiil her aunt's circle again, but entered into the most animated conversation. Is this vour first visit to the States, Miss Smith?" O, no! I was born in South Carolina, but my father removed to San Francisco, when I was a clhild.  I am very proud of my native State, and claim to be a true Southl Carolinian." Cadet Smith smiled quietly, "I think we must be near- ly related, as I am from Ohio, no wonder I was attracted at once." "Indeed? antipodes in that sense!" He winced a little as he was as true an Ohian, but did not like the turn the conversation had taken. "This is just the place for antipodes to meet, and be attracted. "Let us drop our States, here, and take our Country." lone replied. "In honoring our state we hlonor our country, and I cannot see the propriety of dropping my state, even at West Point." Mr. Smith would not reply, and flew to the " dernier re- sort" of West Point conversation. "Is this your first visit at West Point?" "Yes; and every thing is beautiful, as it is new, to hme!"

He had not an- swered her, and she said, "You will not be anything but a witness against yourself, for you prefer the society of anIly one to mine!" "O, Mrs. Bobaline, how severe of you to say that to me  - You llust be perfectly aware that I prefer your so- ciety to that of any young lady.

Madame Bobaline and Lieutenant Mera sat for some time in silence, while their minds countermarched, musing over the field of the past. She knew he was a sincere admirer of hers, though, as he had never proposed, not a discarded lover. She however preferred the handsome, indifferent Saberin, and flattered him, and was delighted when they were stationed at West Point, together. Lieu- tenant Mera, while he had not quite recovered from the wound her bright eyes had given him, liked her frank, manly husband, and was very jealous for himn; while, in point of fact there was little cause for it, as Lieutenant Saberin was too much absorbed in his own ambitious schemes, to pay much heed to her silly sighing for his so- ciety. At length the lady yawned, and looking toward the long line of well-dressed ladies and their gaily caparisoned escorts as they returned from parade, exclaimed, "O, dear I what a tiresome routine.

"O, don't be putting those thngs into her head, she will learn them soon enough," Lieutenant Burlyton re- plied. Then turning to Ione, "You never flirted a mite, in all your pretty life, I'll bet my hat on that!" "No, indeed! and I never intend to!"

The last words were addressed to her own little face in the glass, as she was much amused to hear Viola's tiny feet, pattering away through the hall to tea, and the little face nodded a funny assent. Mrs. Bobaline and Lieutenant Mera were standing ill tlhe hall. As she came down, she heard Viola say " after singing Tennyson's ' Miller's Daughter' to me, she first thought of you, sitting alone here." Lieutenant Mera raised his killing eyes on Ione, till ]lers fell, before his look of scrutiny. "I will forgive Miss Ione, if it proves not the last thlought she gives me," he said bowing apologetically. Ione thought, I fear it will not, if I get glances like that, often.

Mrs. Bobaline entered the dining room, on Mollday, intending to sit at table an indefinite period of time, till her hero made his appearance; but was surprised to see him seated by Lieutenant Mera, in an earnest conversa- tion. He arose, greeted her warmly, seated her at table, resumed his own seat, and said no more. Lieutenant Mera calle(d out, 1"Now our party is com- plete, can we not get up a sail to Cro'nest? it would be something new." "Yes, as novel as a joke from Lieutenant Mera," shouted Lieutenant Burlyton. Presently the door of the dining room opened, and some one took a seat at Mrs. Bobaline's side. Lieutenant Bur- lyton, who was seated opposite, looked up at Lieutenant Mera, and winked to him, saying, "That Dora Bellamy will make some nice man a wife." A low voice said, "Would I were Dora." 4"No one spoke, and the tease bit his lip, and looked foiled. Lieutenant Saberin leaned forward, for a dish of asparagus, and glanced below him, but found his glance taken prisoner, by two sentinels in blue. The room was very quiet till dinner was over. In the hall Lieutenant Burlyton whispered to Ione, laughed, and walked off tra-la-la-ing, to show himself " fancy-free." In the parlor the pretty rosy fingers of Mrs. Bobaline touch- ed the keys of the piano, at first a little staccato, gradu- ally growing tender, even mournful.

Mrs. Bobaline arose and went to lher room. lone sat on the floor, reading a volume of illus- trated Pickwick. Viola silently arrayed herself inll a beautiful and becoming blue robe of foulard silk, and lay down to take her siesta. This was indispensable to hec existence, she affirmed. She could not sleep. She was feverish and restless. "Ione; why did you answer that terrible Burlyton? 1 was quite angry!" "O, aunty, only to ' conciliate' him, as he calls it." And she yawned, as if she would swallow Pickwick literally. "Well please do not make yourself conspicuous, by speaking to him again; do not answer him!" She tossed awhile, closed her soft eyes, but not to sleep - she peeped through the long lashes at the bright face so wilfully hlap- py, smiles, or a low musical laugh, broke like gleams of sunshine from her heart, and lips. At last looking up,.she saw her aunt was not asleep, and said, "Who is Apollo, aunty?" ' The man who owns the Apollo-roomsy I suppose, does not Pickwick tell vou?" "I was not reading - I was thinking." "' Pray don't call me aunty! one would suppose I was an old black. I cannot divine how you ever came to wo- man's estate, so like a plant reared in a cellar, in body and mind." A merry laugh trembled out of Ione's throat, at the queer image conjured up before her, and she sprang up to look into the mirror, under the vague apprehension that she should see a long, yellowish, wlite stalk! She blushed when she saw - no matter! - yes, more mind than mat- ter. "Well, what vanity!" said "aunty" who had near wrung her neck, to see the cause of Ione's haste. "Why au - I mean Mrs. - I mean, I was frightened, lest I did look that funny way." Mrs. Bobaline laughed in a very merry and natural manner, for lone's na'ivet6 was irresistible.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,     49 "Why did you ask me who Apollo was?" "Because Lieutenant Burlyton asked me in the hall, if I saw Apollo looking at me, at dinner. W"Who did he mean?"

"' Call me Viola; his name is Lieutenant Saberin,'g and Mrs. Bobaline turned her face away, really hating herself for being so cross, but unable to control her unbridled tem- per. lone murmured a sweet little home song, very low. Her aunt exclaimed pettishly, "I beg you will not sing, when I lie down to take my siesta. The head of Ione gradually drooped till it touched the couch, and she slept--instead of weeping as she feared she was about to do - the sleep of a 1tleart at peace with all the world. Mrs. Bobaline heard her regular breathing, and turned to look at the gentle face at her side. The sweet repose that rested there recalled the time, not very far back, when she nestled her own warm young cheek on lier mother's breast, and a tear stole from under her burn- ing eye-lid. She gently stroked the silken head. "In- deed, I will be a mother to you, pretty one!" she mur- mured. lone, aroused from her light sleep by the voice and touch of her hand, sat up. Mrs. Bobaline arose, and kiss- ed her brow, and asked her to lie down. Ione thanked her, but she was quite refreshed, and she wondered what made her aunt so tender, all at once. "I will be a mother to you!" Ah, fair lady, you had not counted the cost of this beautiful impulse. "Ione, would you like to go to parade?" "Of all things, dear Viola'! but I heard you say it wearied you to death."    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6558-00000025"/> 50         Tactics; or, "Well, it does sometimes, at other times Henjoy it very much, but everything must go just right."

There were no officers there ; they walked into the parlor, and lone touched the keys of the piano, and played the , Offi- cers' call," which she had caught by ear. In a few mo- ments Lieutenants Storme and Burlyton came, and looked into the windows. "Here we are, lady fair! will you honor us with your commands? ' They came into the parlor, and Ione retreated to the window. "Don't spring out, now! Permit me to present Lieu- tenant Storme;- Miss Smith. I believe you have the pleasure of knowing Madam Bobaline." This lads looked darrggers at him. She had not noticed what Ione'was playing, and would rather have stopped in the house, than go out with the two gentlemen she was more indifferent to, than all the rest. "x We are waitingr for some friends," she observed in as quiet a manner as she could command. O, then you did not mean to call us, Miss lone?" "Call you?" echoed her aunt. "Yes, she played the ' Officers' call."' , Mrs. Bobaline's fair face darkened, and she sat down to play.

Now we shall be too late for parade." Lieutenant Mera gave an inquiring glance at lone. She smiled, and said, "I suppose it was foolislh, but I caught tlhe air, by hearing it, and scarcely knew I was playing it, and I assure you I knew nothing of their presence, or even what Lieutenant Burlyton meant till he explained." Mrs. Bobaline still felt much annoyed, and left the room. lone related to her companion, how she had offended. "' I love that martial bugle, and have caught several of the lit- tle airs fromn it." , Lieutenant Mera bowed his head, and whispered " play it softly sometimes, and I will come, at least if you desire it." "O, Lieutenant Mera, I could not do that!" and she blushed deeply, and followed her aunt, her companion joined her, and though they walked quickly, weie unable to overtake the receding figure of Madam B., till she was lost among the crowd of ladies and gentlemAn g:tthered about the iron seats'on the parade (round.

He soon left her, and brlouglht up one or two others, so that she was surround- ed bv officers till the parade was over. Ione went as near her aunt as shle could get, but her ladyship took no notice of her, and though the Colonel turned to permit lier to join the circle, Viola neither recognised nor intro- duced lier, which greatly surprised and mortified her, and she stood in silence by Lieutenant Mera's side. ,: ..

Viola glanced at her, and replied for her, " O, do not ask." "Why?" he interrogated, curiously." You are not sensitive about your name too, are you?" asked Lieutenant Mera. "O, it is such a comical collection," laughed Madam. ' No, indeed, Lieutenant Mera, I am rather proud of it, amusing as Viola seems to think it." Mrs. Bobaline could not suppress another musical laugch. Lieutenant Burlyton said abruptly, "I don't know a more comical name than Bobalihle!" "But her name is Isagone Bobaline Smith-isn't that funny?" They all laughed. lone blushed and parried the joke by saying, her mother was French by descent, and that her grandmother's maiden name was Isagone Bayard, that her mother had given her the good lady's name in full. "You never told me that. I thought the B. in your name stood for Bobaline," said her aunt, resentfully. Lieutenant Mera rose in the awkward pause that en- sued, and asked Madam to walk. As they proceeded, he very adroitly soothed her wounded vanity': Any one can see at a glance that Bobaline is a change from Robert Alleine, the name no doubt of a brave French knight, of three or four centuries back; only that Lieutenant B. is such a noble, matter-of-fact fellow, that he never troubles himself about such trifles." "Trifles!" cried the excited lady, "One's name is no trifle; and if it is so, why should not my husband at- tend to it? He ought, for--for my sake. I hate the name, and have never been addressed by it without feeling mortified." 4"You must make him attend to it at once." This delicate consideration made the humbled lady al- most love the wily one, and he assumed at once the pro- portions of a man of taste and discernment in her eyes.

Mrs. Bobaline said she would ask permission of Lieu- tenant B., as she always called him; she could not bring herself to speak the disagreeable cognomen, but to do her justice she had too much feeling to tell him so. She was silent for some time and then said, "I don't see why his name was not Bayard, that is a sweet name." "1 Lieutenant Mera bit his lip, and thought "how wo- manish!" ;; LESSON THRD." "Oblique Firings.'   - . Lieutenants Mera and Saberin laughed merrily,; as they emerged from the breakfast-room, the' former had been amusing his friend by repeating the conversation of the evening before, on the subject of names. They took their hats and walked to the north door of the hall. Lieutenant Saberin asked, "What is the sum of Miss Smith?" "Not much, she is just so so," replied Lieutenant Me- ra shrugging his elegant shoulders. "I perceive l--one who plays round the head, but comes not near the heart." "Precisely!" "Yet she seems rather brilliant in her tiltings with Bur- lyton." Looking up, they saw Mrs. Bobaline on the piaz- za, and saluted her as Mrs. Beauballeine, with a very dis- agreeable look of mirth in their eyes. But their own mortification would have been exquisite, had they known tlhat lone was seated in the private parlor, and had heard every word they had said. The book Cadet Smith had given lone the evening be- fore, she had brought down in her hand when she came to breakfast, and had gone in the parlor to read it, while Mrs. Bobaline, supposing she had gone to her room, lingered on the piazza, to get a bow from her hero.     <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6558-00000027"/> 54         Tactics; or, The gentlemen conversed a few moments with her when Lieutenant Saberin turned to go to the office, but stopped before entering the hall, and drawing a letter from his pocket, examined the address. Not a movement was lost on Mrs. Bobaline, who, in the pause of the conversation, heard him say, "She is mine, by Jupiter." Slle forgot to reply to some nice remark from Lieutenant Mera, quite piquing that young gentleman, who left her suddenly, just as Lieutenant Saberin turned from the telescope, at whichl he had stopped to take a peep at a yatch. He did not look at Mrs. Bobaline, but as he turned and entered the hall, a letter fell from his coat, and blew towards her. She snatched it up and throwing it into the parlor-window, retreated hastily around the piazza, in time to see Lieuten- ant Saberin going quickly towards the post-office. The letter flew into Ione's face with such force, as to make her nearly cry out. Glancing out of the window and seeing no one, she concluded some cadet had thrown it, and flew to her room, without looking at it. When Mrs. Bobaline ran into the parlor to secure her treasure, she looked diligently for it, but no letter was there. She ran to the piazza; had it flown out of the window? No, there was no letter, she could scarcely credit her senses: but fearing Lieutenant Saberin's return to look for it, she fled to her room, and like a wretched culprit, locked her door, and wept violently, plead head-ache to lone, and was invisible for the next twelve hours.

As Mrs. Bobaline and lone sat on the piazza, lone look- ed over the plain, and longed to become invisible, that she might have one grand romp over its beautiful expanse.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,     55 She felt like a poor prisoner, and heartily sympathized with the cadets. "Viola, let us go and take a walk." "You are not used to the trammels of society, are you, lone?" There was something terrible in her aunt's scornful lit- tle laugh, whenever the poor girl made a remark, and now she looked so disappointed, that her aunt condescended to say, "Why my dear, I could not walk across that plain for any consideration, without an escort. When I was a Florida belle, I knew Lieutenants Saberin and Mera, and I never went out without one or two officers in my train, and do you think I would let my old beaux see me walk- ing like a servant, unescorted?" "Dear Viola, we need not care for any one. I am sure I don't, and-you are married, aren't you?" plead lone. "Hush! do not let any one hear you express yourself so vulgarly." I've seen ladies walking alone, do, dear Viola! It will be so charminog." "You see no person of distinction alone. I have never done it. I wonder the cadets do not come for you!"Mrs. Bobaline spoke severely and lone felt it. They sat a few moments and Mrs. B. arose and went to the parlor window ; there sat Lieutenant Miera, with a book before him, apparently fast asleep. She turned hastily and entering the half door said, "l one put on your things; we will go out!" Her voice and manner had changed magi- cally. They were soon walking rapidly down the cavalry road, Ione lost in wondering what her aunt would do next. Near the chapel they met Cadet Smith. Madam gave him a sweet smile, and he turned and came to Ione's side. "Where are your smiles to-day, Miss lone? you are walking so quickly and looking so demurely, I am afraid you are ' Wheaton-ing it,' or in other words, on your way to the hospital." lone smiled faintly, her aunt said tartly, "We are walk- ing for our health I " "Indeed?" he replied, then- lowering his voice, asked    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6558-00000028"/> 56         Tactics; or, lone., " how long since you have lost your hlealth, and got that pretty consumption tinge on your cheek?" lone lautghed in a very natural way.

Please laugh when you are with me, Miss lone. Your laugh reminds me of my home, and my own sweet sisters." The boy spoke with so much emotion, that it touched Ione deeply, and quite subdued Mrs. Bobaline. Seeing the clouds returning to Ione's face, Cadet Smith began to draw upon his imnagination to elicit another lauch.                         t "' Did you ever hear the story of the poor ' Sep.'? He had heard of the cadets foraging for apples and grapes, and not knowing about tihe fine fruit orclllards of the Kinsley place below us, he supposed they were taken from the gardens of the professors, and seeing some temptingr apples in one of thenm, crept in after dark, climbed the tree and was satisfyinu himself voraciously, when two young ladies came out to walk in the garden, and talk over their love affairs.

"Nonsense, Lieutenant Mera! don't give us the blues, because you have them, it is unmanly." His dark eyes glowed like coals of living fire; she had snapped the last link that bound him to a vain, spiteful wo- rnal. "Miss lone, I beg you will pardon me, if I have given you pain, but 'tis true as gospel! Content yourself to be a belle, and slay with the rest of the destroyers!" Madam walked away. Ione stood a little above him on the bank, subdued by the picture of the lot assigned to man by the stern soldier, her eyes filled with tears; she laid her hand softly on his arm, "Caius Marius, take me down to see the monument if you please. Tuckerman says ' sepulchral monuments address the feelings both of love and pride, which bind generations of heroes tog'eth- er.'" Lieutenant Mera took her hand, and helped her down the bank, and while she was reading the inscription; his eyes were fixed upon her with a cold scrutiny; but when she finished, and turned away her head to hide the large tear that hung on her dark lashes, he took her hand, and drew it kindly in his arm.

She ascended the steps of the hotel, but not daring to enter lest she should offend the capri- cious lady, her aunt, she looked with the deepest interest toward the river, sweeping the plain with her eyes for Caius Marius, but he was nowhere to be seen. The Colonel assisting Mrs. Bobaline, ran gaily up the steps like a boy of fifteen, left her, and approached lone. With a bold stare of admiration, he presented her a hand- kerchief, saying, "I never in my life did hear of chal- lencre urged more modestly!'" Ione's face became scarlet, she looked at the dainty ar- ticle, held by the extreme corner, between his thumb and finger,-to her own hands and pocket, - then to her aunt, whose face was beamning with wickedness, she cast down her eves, pained to a degree, took the handkerchief, cour- tesied very haughtily, entered the hotel, and her own room, and gave vent to her deep humiliation in a flood of tears. After a " splendid time," with the gallant Colonel, Mrs. Bobaline went into the parlor, sat down to the piano, played and sang with her usual--not self-forgetfulness, but forgetfulness of everything but self. The Colonel said she must come out to parade. Well, where was lone? CG LESSON THRD. ' "The March by the Flank." Mrs. Bobaline went to lone's door.

Ione rose, bathed her red eyes and nose, the nose had the vote this time, and shewed its triumph, by looking like an English ensign. To parade they went. A group of officers hovered near, among whom she saw Lieutenants Mera and Saberin. Her aunt's discomforture was com- plete, for after walking across the plain like a servant, un- escorted, the Colonel had a party of ladies there, from Cozzens, and did not even come to speak to her, and had not the ' odious "Lieutenant Burlyton joined them, she-would have had to leave the seats unattended. But she lisped her sweetest phrases in gratitude for his attention. lone thought " sleek flattery and she, are twin-born sisters." Her arts were lost on the sturdy soldier, who paid little heed to them, but made the most of his time with " little one," as he called lone, and had, as he reported in bar- racks, "A perfect hlocus-pocus time, with Mrs. Bobaline," spending the entire evening, much to that fine lady's cha- grin. It never occurred to the matter-of-fact Lieutenant that an officer of the U. S. A. could be anything else than captivating to a woman. He told lone what the color of her eyes were, the quality of her hair, the imperfections of her complexion, the shape of her head, etc., quite in a friendly way. After he was gone, Mrs. Bobaline sat and gave vent to her mortification by explaining to lone, causes and their effects. "The officers'all court wealth, you see, from the Colonel down to the cadet captain; girls need not come here, looking for attention, who have not splendid homes to invite them to, or a grand party to accompany them.

"Is it possible?" "Yes ma'am," replied Tone quietly. "Well do bring it in, in some way, and tell Lieutenant Mera; I have been annoyeid to death by questions about you." "I cannot see why people should interest themselves about me, I never ask who they are, and shall certainly not take the pains to tell Lieutenant Mera anything about it; why should I? he is nothing to me." "Yes, but we owe something to society; we must all give a quid pro quo, for what we receive; if you pretend to be white, you must substantiate your claims to the con- siderations of society." lone's spirit was fast getting roused; hunted like a hare out of all her pretty resources, reading, walking, and mu- sic, which had always made her feel independent of the whims and caprices of those around her, she began to view life as a battle field, in which it was every one for himself. "I came to see you, and uncle, and have a pleasant little visit, and can be very happy seeing all these gay sights, hearing this delicious music, and walking through these enchanting scenes.

It is natural to suppose so. A poor widow's daughter should try to do what she can for herself." She looked at Ione out of the corner of her eye, and saw a very perceptible curl on her lip. "To be sure, you might do better in San Francisco than here, and "And, as you say, the officers are like sleep - 'And ready visits pay, where fortune smiles'-- "- Let me, a poor widow's daughter, be grateful for the crumbs of flattery, and smiles, that fall from these fortunate belles' table." Mrs. Bobaline out of temper and patience, could give no more advice to one on whom the valuable commodity was only thrown away.  She retired to her room without deigning to say good-night. lone went to her prayers, and was very penitent that she had vexed her aunt, and promised to be more dutiful in the future. "ESSON FOURTH."

Dora went with her, who by the way, I consider much the prettiest of the two, - Miss Smith turned her head twice, as much as to say, Can you resist? Lieutenant Mera asked slily, why he did not go with her, as he did not doubt she had a message from Madam, for him, adding, " you conceited fop, she is as far from being a flirt as a fool, which you are trying to make her out; be- sides, she does not admire you at all, she told me, you al- ways reminded her of a bachelor friend, who, reveled the majority of his time in the sulks, and in those moods flew into a vehicle, which he called in an eminently proper manner a ' sulky,' which lie nearly lived in." Lieutenant Saberin was not flattered, and said he did not see the application. "Never mind the application;" said Lieutenant Mera, delighted to have vexed him, for his conceit. They arose and walked. Presently they met Miss Smith and Lieu- tenant Burlyton; truly enough, lone looked wistfully at Lieutenant Saberin. Lieutenant Mera was profoundly puzzled. He had thought her too modest and sensible to show such public admiration for any man; could she have taken it into ler head to try to attract that unsocial and aristocratic fellow by this folly? This was simply absurd, no, there was something going on under this pretty panto- mime. He tried in vain to convince Lie[enant Saberin of this, who thought Lieutenant Mera jealous, told him he need have no fears, he could not condescend to rival him.

So rapt was she, that she forgot her own existence for a long time, but the fact that there was a Miss lone Smith, was forced upon her when, " with wild surprise she stood" and listened, most unwillingly, to the conversation of two gentlemen on a path below her. She could not see them, but as they addressed each other by name, she discovered that they were Lieutenants Mera and Saberin. O Saberin, I succumb, the old witch certainly was right! I am a Boeotian! I never was so deceived in a girl!" "Ha! ha!   Love is a celestial humbug!" laughed Lieutenant Saberin. "Faith, I am sorry for the little thing, but I am to be gone so soon, and then she'll fall back on her cadets! She's ambitious, Mera! she's ambi- tious!" "Bah!" was Lieutenant Mera's reply. lone wished for wings, but had not got hers yet, poor girl! Lieutenant Saberin sang ' Cupid is a knavish lad, Thus to make poor females mad!" Lieutenant Mera said " bah!" Lieutenant Saberin laughed. "O, gentle Protheus, Love's a mighty lord!" Lieutenant Mera turned fiercely, "What do you mean; that I am in love with Miss Smith?" His friend did not answer, and when Lieutenant Mera spoke again, his voice was husky with rage. "Saberin, you are a puppy! "Go wretch! and give a life like thine to other wretches -live!" shouted Lieutenant Saberin in mock tragedy,- their voices mingled in a boisterous, heartless laugh, and they moved on. Ione was petrified. She had not the pow- er to move.

"Only a stroll down the bank; and have tired myself out!" she replied petulantly. "Well, arrange your hair for tea, as I am going down!" She found her aunt talking with Lieutenants Mera and Saberin in the hall, and sweeping past them with the erect head of one who was perfectly aware that she was misunderstood, and maltreated generally, she entered the tea-room alone. After she passed, Lieutenant Mera said, "what's up?" Mrs. Bobaline smiled, and replied "she did not know unless lone was in love! She had been wandering away down flirtation walk,' alone for hours, that afternoon." The friends glanced at each other. They went in with Madam and sat by her. lone however never raised her eyes, and answered a question Lieutenant Mera put to her, in such a way that they saw she meant to be uncivil, and they became in consequence very polite to Mrs. Bobaline. Ione left them at the table, and went into the parlor, where a lady was singing, and as the sweet notes stole through the house, the two young men heard it, and both being fond of music entered the parlor together, the first time since Ione came.

Whly should her gay, witty, lovely aunt, weep? lone thouht  if any one in the world had cause to weep, she had. Had  she not tried to please every one?

The colonel rose with his cup in his hand, went to the other side of the table where lone had seated herself5 and sat down beside her. She looked painfully conscious of having robbed her aunt of her finest feather, which highly incensed the penetrating lady, for she read quite plainly, "( Dear Viola, I - I don't want the Colonel!" Madam concealed her chagrin behind a sprightly mischievousness, completely disconcerting the poor girl, so that she scarcely knew what she was saying. "Fair lady," began the colonel, " may I presume on a few moments of your precious time, since all the fascina- ting younger men are gone."' lone looked at Viola, a blush and a spasmodic working of the mouth, were her only reply. "Will you take a turn in the carriage with me this bright morning?" lone dared not raise her eyes, but answered, "I'll ask Viola:"' Mrs. Bobaline laughed loudly. "Do as you please, Ione, one would suppose I was an old beldame, keeping watch and ward over you!"

She saw Lieutenant Burlyton just descending the steps. She flew to him, told him lone was crazy to visit the home of the "Horace of the age; " that they were making up an excursion party; that he was indispensable to her happiness, with much more to that effect, all of which Lieutenant Burlyton, the generous, as he should liave been stvled, believed, and fell into the snare at once, saying "All right, I'm readlv.

They were soon reminded by tile untiring Mrs. Maryrglot, that the hour had arrived but not the beaux! The ladies descended, and were not a little annoyed to find only Lieutenant Burlyton, with whlom none of them happened to be in love. Presently, Lieu- tenant Saberin came, and took his station by lone. Mris. Bobaline could not have this; she beckoned her into the hall, and gave her a little motherly advice. "T he colonel had invited her to go, and she must show a little character, anti not bring superior officers into juxta-position with sulb- ordinates, that they might fight and kill each other!" lone was ready to cry, and begged to stay at home. Mad- am laughed in her bracelet, and said, "' O, by no means, only be a little discreet, I'll give you hints occasionally!" She promised to obey, and they set out. The tardy Colonel came directly to lone, and apologized for his want of punctuality in not meeting her precisely at the hour.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.      79 Lieutenant Saberin looked sulky and greatly inclined to ' back out," but Mrs. Bobaline came to his rescue, like a skillful general. "Colonel, I would like to consult you for a moment," she cried after him. The Colonel turned to her, and Lieutenant Saberin took the post he wanted, while Lieutenant Burlyton shouted behind her, "How can the queen of love and beauty bear the fatigue!" Lieutenant Saberin put his hand in lone's arm, and walked fiister to get away from' them, and when far before them, was silent and gloomy. Ione at first felt resentful, but glanc- ing at his proud, dark face, the thought entered her in- nocent heart, "' Perhaps he has some deep sorrow, that lies buried in his own breast." And forgetting her pride, and that he was a reserved young officer, expecting to be amused, she warbled lowly and sweetly, "Ne'er tell me of glories serenely advancing,; The close of our day, the caln eve of our night; Give me back, give me back, the wild freshness of morning, Her clouds and her tears, are worth evening's best light." Lieutenant Saberin started from his reverie, and begged her to sing the whole song for him. She did so; he was delighted with it, and the rest of the party joined them. Mrs. Bobaline looked eloquently at lone, and she gravely took her seat in the boat beside the Colonel. Lieutenant Saberin looked questioningly at her, and at every one else, but saw no solution of the enigma. There lurked a very bewitching smile about the mouth and downcast eyes of Mrs. Bobaline. Lieutenant Saberin thought, "' The little one is stupid, Madame sees it, and Madame is very ap- preciative, and by George! very pretty," -and he seated himself by Madame.   In a few moments they were ex- changing those nameless little courtesies, which seem to constitute such a spell of enchantment over the minds of the members of the "Mutual Admiration Society," and by the time the boat reached the shore, they set off togeth- er, apparently perfectly satisfied with the arrangement. Lieutenant Saberin had a method in his madness, however,    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6558-00000040"/> 80         Tactics ; or, for the idea had entered his brain, to sound Mrs. Bobaline about Ione. "She is rather interesting, and amusingly do- cile- but is she rich? How came she to West Point?" Violetta evidently did not care to show her off, she had avoided introducing him to her. Was she ashamed of her family? She had waylaid him to introduce him to AMiss Arnold." All these things passed in review before him, anid made him curious to fathom her ladyship's designs.

"Yes, she is very demure ; unaccustomed to society, I imagine," answered Mrs. Bobaline. "You imagine? do you not know? Is she some prin- cess in disguise,' some fay from fairy-land?' " "She certainly is no princess, though the Colonel ap- pears to think her a fairy or something of the sort, he talks such nonsense to her! ' "t Who is she? What is she?"

" A long silence followed " the short and, simple annals " of poor lone, and Lieutenant Saberin set his sails to in- vestigate for himself this terre incognita, and falling into a ruminating state of mind, he walked on without speaking, chagrining Madame extremely, for she saw that she had overstepped the bounds of policy. She certainly had shown no kindly feeling for her young ward, and that to a man to whom, above all others, she would fain appear an- gelic; she was far too selfish and " beautifully impulsive," to be mistaken for an angel by any one who hlad seen her. often; and she had shown such undisguised admiration for Lieutenant Saberin, that a secret contempt had crept into that gentleman's mind for the poor infatuated lads ; still,  his human nature could scarcely resist the worship of such a pretty woman.   Cupid hi Shoulder-Straps,     81 "C7tang-e Step." Mrs Bobaline showed signs of fatigue, supposing Lieu- tenant Saberin would offer her his arm ; but she was dis- appointed; for he begged her pardon, and arranged a seat fo- her, to await the coming up of the company. They sat quietly enjoying the scene, apparently, but each was busy with the darling scheme, - Lieutenant Saberin plot- ting to get possession of Ione; and poor, imprudent Mrs. Bobaline smothering the sighs, and crushing back the tears that nearly found their way to the hot cheeks several times, was building a Jacob's ladder to regain her lost elevation in his eves. "Ho! Saberin," shouted Lieutenant Burlyton. ( Giv- en out?" "Yes," he answered gruffly. Mrs. Marvyglot hlad performed the walk in true English style, and pranced up, glowing like a rose, to the panting Mrs. Bobaline, ,' Up, up!" cried she " labor vincet omnia." "Miserere mei!" affectedly murmured the exhausted lady.  i"Ipse frueris otio," continued Mrs. Maryglot. "Pray, Mrs. Maryglot, speak German, we don't under- stand you!  said Lieutenant  Burlyton, lookingr very drolly at the learned lady. "Very well;" she replied " after this, you shall con- verse in your native tongue, ' German  to soldiers!' I think you said." "My   native tongue? I hope you don't take me for a Dutchman'! Ha! ha!" and Lieutenant Burlyton lay down on the grass, and rolled. "Mrs. Maryglot has just told Mrs. Bobaline, that she beats an omnibus; Colonel, what do you think of that?" Seeing Mrs. Marvglot taking aim at him, he went on, "not in so many words to be sure, but as near as he could understand her," and he laughed immoderately.

Lieutenant Burlyton had arisen and drawn near the belligerents, enjoyin'g the prospect of fun. "When Greek meets Greek," he shlouted. Mrs. Maryglot fell into a tragical attitude, grasping the shawl that was falling from her shoulders, so that almost unconsciously she assumed the grand grace and dignity of a Roman senator. Waving her uncovered and finely moulded arm to and fro, her voice rang out, ' What, what are your barren hills, and chaotic scenery, compared to classic, storied Europe, where we breathe the air of Eden and behold the foot-prints of an Alexander, a Julius Cesar, a Frederick William? What are your savage haunts com- pared to such scenes?" Her nostrils dilated like those of a war-horse. lone drew near the place of conflict, and laid her hand softly on the Colonel's arm. ' Madam! madam!" cried the infuriated man, " was Washington a savage? Are not his foot-steps more - more ---yes, more?" ," Yes, yes," echoed Lieutenant Burlyton. Just at that instant they were shocked by peals of laugh- ter from Mrs. Maryglot. She pointed beyond them, they turned, and saw Lieutenant Saberin with his cap nicely adjusted on a crotched stick, preparing to photograph the group. Squinting over it, he cried in the most business- like tone, "Eyes a little oblique, Colonel." They all laughed, and good humor was restored. Lieutenant Saberin put on his cap, and advancing to lone, took the wild flow- ers from her hand, in a quiet brotherly way, and offered her his arm.

Cupid in Shoulder Straps.     83 She could think of nothing just then, but the gravity with which he had enacted the daguerreotvpist; and her laugh rang through the air, awakening the echoes among the hills, and rather throwing Lieutenant Saberin on his dignity. She explained that it was his cleverness that amused her, and he rewarded her, by throwing off the magnificent officer, and donning the fascinating young gentleman, and succeeded beautifully. Their walk was at an end, much too soon for either party. Mrs. Maryglot was with the warlike Colonel, who was'anxious to retrieve his character in her eyes, by enlightening her dark mind, as it regarded the hallowed ground she was treading. As they approached the home of the poet, she asked '"If the village was built on the General's domains ;-- were they his tenantry?"  Mrs. Bobaline and Lieutenant Burlyton were directly behind them, and enjoying their conversation very much, but this was too much for the fun-loving Lieutenant, he gave forth one of his sonorous neighs, mak- ing both ladies shrink with affrighlt The Colonel, unwilling to lower this grand idea to the democratic fact, darted a savage look at Lieutenant Burlyton, and said gravely, "There are several estates joined here, I believe." "What great man owns and cultivates these enormous hills, or do they cultivate them?" O, yes; there are many cottages built at intervals, and there are fine graperies, and orchards of rare fruit, and -such things." She thought this very fine; saying it was quite a re- spectable country. She was indignant that the General did not preserve acres and acres of park and green-sward around his mansion, and have herds of deer, and ponds for fish, and swans, etc. she could not forgive him for it!

" Lieutenant Burlyton, who had to drag thl weary lady every step, as he afterward said, dropped his head, rushed from her side, stepped into the boat, and giving lone his hand, seated her cosily by his side, leaving the rest to take care of themselves.

Lieutenant Saberin regarded Mrs. Bobaline curiously. "' You are going, are you not?" he said, but made no ef- fort to assist her.

The whole party were in the water in an instant. Lieutenant Saberin lhad leaned forward to catch Mrs. Bobaline, lost his balance and fell after her head-foremost into the water also; he ri^ghted himself quickly and caught her up, as beillg the object of his pursuit, but was unconscious that any one else was in the water till he had landed Mrs. Bobaline; what was his dismay to see the lalf-drowned Colonlel clinoing to the boat, and the Lieutenant and Mrs. Maryglot rolling over   Clpid in Shoulder-Straps,       85 and over each other like playful porpoises, while Tone was driftillg away, with a piteous look on her death-like face. lie could nlot reason, he rushed into the water, and after :1 sliarp struglll e secured her with one arm, while he at- telllite'd to reacl the shore with the othler.

Every one was sullen or thankful, and even poor Madam Maryglot had not a word to say for herself, except that, "It was a wonder of mercies that they were not go- ing home dead corpses!" in a very quiet, Christian way. Lieutenant Burlyton's chin was buried in his wet bosom, which heaved and shook at this sally, like a disturbed jelly, but his mouth was serene as usual. He however had fun enough, marshalling and marching them up to the hotel, which they reached unseen, but there, ye gods! "The handsome bar-maids stare, as mute as fishes; And sallow waiters, frightened, drop their dishes!" The servants ran out to see them, but the ingenious Lieutenant B. asked them if they had never heard of peo- - ple going in swimming, or bathing, before, attitudinizing before them he repeated, "The torrent roar'd; and we did buffet it With lusty sinews; throwing it aside, And stemming it with hearts of controversy." They retired abashed.

Lieutenant Saberin felt a languor and depression un- known to him, for some days, and avoided ever)y one. In one of these new phases of his character, he seated himself in the loneliest spot he could find. Here Love, the mis- chievous boy, brought to his side a pretty blue-eyed girl, just as he had adjusted his ]orgrette to peep at a black-eyed one, from New Orleans. Of course he could not expose his infidelity to the intruder, so he  politely offered her a seat at his side   to admire, as he knew  she would, the  lovely scene  around him.   The little lass was  " fond and fair to see. She   asked him if he  had a little notelet in his '" vade recure," he had never read.    With a rueful tinge on his ingenuous face, he drew out the little book, and among the leaves discovered, "The Lost Bird." "My bird has flown away, Far out of sight has flown, I know not where; Look in your lawn, I pray, Ye maidens kind and fair, And see if my beloved bird be there! His eyes are full of light,- The eagle of the rock has such an eye,- And plumes, exceeding bright, On his smooth temples lie ; And sweet his voice, and tender as a sigh! Look where the gras: is gay With summer blossoms--haply there he cowers- And search, from spray to spray, The leafy, laurel bowers; For well he loves the laurels and the flowers!

When he looked up, the blue-eyed one had vanished, or he saw her not for the tears that, ' stealing from his eyes in large, silent drops, without his leave," " dropped on his doublet as Nature had intended them for ornament!" Long he sat, in contrite sadness. "If she would only hate me! I hate myself! The pure and lovely angel! She would be as happy as a bird in Paradise with me here! - but that can never be! No, no! I am commit- ted to Pauline. Heavens! I could drown myself." His monologue was interrupted by the voice of Lieutenant AMera, behind him. "That little piece of poetry, if you please, Mr. Sa- berin." Lieutenant Saberin turned upon him like a '" tiger chafed by the hunter's spear."' "Mera!" Mera's frank, manly face saved him. Ne'er had Al- pine son such need," for Lieutenant Saberin was ready to dash him down the rocks, had he not been arrested by the majesty of Lieutenant Mera's mien, and the lion-like, de- fiant look of his large, dark eye. Lieutenant Mera divined at once, that his friend sup- posed he had heard his soliloquy, when he had that mo- ment dropped upon the grass at his side, the damp green- sward muffling his tread, so that Lieutenant Saberin, bu- ried in such an intense depth of thought, had neither seen nor heard him. He supposed the last exclamation addressed to himself, as a prefatory remark to some confidence about   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.     89 to be placed in his keeping; and seeing the poetry lying on the ground, asked familiarly, and as he thought, face- tiously, for it. Lieutenant Saberin covered his flashing eves with his land, snatching the paper from the ground, turned and walked away. Lieutenant Mera, generous as brave, arose, followed him, and laying his hand in his arm gently as a girl, began in low, loving tones, to tell him some of his own plans. They walkled on till, coming in sight of the hotel, he said, "Hallo! Ladies? Who are they?"    They could not see, till near the hedge, when they discovered they were Mrs. Bobaline and lone; the former looking lovelier than ever, in a white robe. Lieutenant Saberin, really pitying her, had looked for her reappearance, to pay his most (deferential respects to her. He now ran lightly up the steps, and without noticing Ione, greeted her warmly. His tactics said that he could not pay one lady a proper compliment, without sacrificing another lady to her. He expressed his delight that her bright presence would mnake the house inhabitable again, he had scarcely been in the house since that unfortunate affair. A  pearly tinge over- spread her pale face, showing that his barbarity to her had not drowned the love'of flattery, or dethroned the idol in her weak heart. "Four.'

There's Lieutenant Mera; be more polite and attentive to him; he has spoken to me of you several times.

"Yes, such airs would come very well from an heiress, but a poor girl must be very sweet, and kind-- not to make a fool of herself though, and show one particular officer that she wishes his attentions alone." "O, don't I wish the bonny boys in grey were to be : there, and not a shade of blue should tinge my sky!" Mrs. Bobaline arose looking offended, and said as she reached the door, "I suppose Miss lone will not object to a few invitations to dance, from the shades of blue." "No-- but what are they to me or I to them, sweet- Viola? all you married ladies are constantly dina-donoinor it in our ears, that the officers avoid a poor girl as they would the - the - small pox.

"Innocent!" exclaimed Mrs. Bobaline, shutting the door with a click. When lone was alone, she ruminated. "Lieutenant Mera has spoken to me of you several times," yes, and he spoke of me to Lieutenant Saberin, " so so," with a shrug of his manly, elegant shoulders. Did that mean love, or any desperate degree of admiration? Not in her poor es- timation. So she chose not to think about the disagreea- ble creatures any more, but took out one of her dresses. She would dress herself prettily this afternoon, as she was to go to walk at four o'clock withl a 1" bonny boy in grey." Her toilet completed, she did not stop to speak to Viola, fearing to displease her by her elaborate attire; she ran hastily down the stairs, hoping she might not encounter any one to detain her, as she must meet her-cavalier more than hldlf way, just outside the north door, which she had chosen, to avoid being seen. *^-    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6558-00000046"/> 92     Tactics or.

I was just going to send up for you, (a white lie) there is to be riding in the hall this afternoon, I thought you might like to go, and now you are all ready and looking as lovely as Wenus. Let us start down here, and take i"Flirtation" in our way." "Thank you Lieutenant Storme, but I have an engage- ment to walk, at this hour." "With whom, may I ask?" "Cadet -" began Ione. "O, never mind. Where were you to meet, outside the hedge e " Ione Towed. "Well, we can go on, and if he is there, we shall meet him. Will that do, Miss lone?"It would be a pity to lose the riding and walk too, as those young men are not the most reliable persons in the world. Lieutenant Storme knew that Ione's cadet was in the south parlor; and if he could get Ione outside the hedge, they could not meet, and he would take the little beauty where she would be seen, and he envied, by officers and cadets. lone was positive that she should meet Cadet Smith at the hedge, and accepted Lieutenant Storme to that spot; but was astonished at not finding him there. He glanced in every direction.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,     93 ;"You see the young man is not as good as his word." Ione looked annoyed, and replied, "I fear your remark is too true, they are unreliable." Ah, well, Miss Ione! I will do my poor endeavors to atone for the young man's delinquency, and do "Flirta- tion" in good cadet style, and then I can take you to see the riding, which Cadet Smith could not do; so please be consoled, and don't look so doleful." "How can you, Mr. Storme, make fun of me so cru- elly! I am sure he has not neglected to come, and I feel there has been some mistake; and I would not appear to disregard our engagement, for the world." ( O, Miss lone, do not you know that young ladies should not make engagements with cadets? Their great subordination renders them liable to receive orders from their superiors, at any moment." "Their superior officer, if you please, Lieutenant Storme," said lone, vexed. "That is better; I would not have you suppose that Cadet Smith has his superior on the Post, except in rank; and I dare affirm has not willingly neglected his engage- ment," he said cunningly; and I will give you his ex- cuse very soon." "You will be saved the trouble, for I think we shall meet him." "He is very unlike me, if he gives up the chase, with such a prize at the end." "Whicli way are you going? this is not the way to 'Flirtation.'"  "No, but I did not wish to leave the hedge too soon, so I thought we would take a look at Fort Clinton, and then return to the hotel, and so around; have I your approv- al?"He said this very earnestly. O, yes, Lieutenaut Storme, you are very kind; and if we do rot find him on his knees, at the entrance of the hedge, ' let me see his eyes, that when I see another man like him, I may avoid him!"

Had he felt indifferent, he would have given chase and claimed her from the superior offi- cer, ibut he was not ; and turned on his lleel, more wounded than angry - very sentimentally indi-gnant. In the door stood a young, lady, an old friend of his, her jaunty little hat hungf over her shoulder by the strings. Cadet Smith asked her whither she was bound.

What power had placed him in her path this afternoon, good or ill? His familiar- ity friglltened and piqued her. If she was astonished at his invitation and evident wish to atone for Cadet Smith's non-appearance, she was still more so at his conversation. He flattered her in the most delicate manner,- told her amusingc stories, and commented most freely upon all the residents of the post,- mentioned who were his favorites among the young officers, in short, was confidential to a most complimentary degree. lone, between perplexity as it regarded the conduct of Cadet Smith, and not knowing what to make of Lieuten- ant Storme, was in a perfect maze of emotions. Cadet Smith had been very polite to her, she had found him un- varying in his attentions, manly and straight-forward-- their little interviews on the piazza, and one or two strolls, she la(d enjoyed very much; and now, to her amazement, she found herself entertained in an equally agreeable man- ner by one of "' the shades of blue " that only the day be- fore she should have protested she was not acquainted with; and her friend had broken an engagement that he seemed to think his existence hung on arranging!

All parties look surprised. " O, conscience, con- science, man's most faithful friend!" Cadet Smith sa- luted Lieutenant Storme, but did not look at Ione. Miss Arnold gave Lieutenant Storme a pleasant bow, and poor Ione looked petrified. "Is not that the young man you were to walk with?" "Yes, Lieutenant Storme," trembled on Ione's lip. What have I done to offend him?" "Please don't mind the freaks of a boy in this way, he has given his conscience a vacation. Really, if you insist on looking so miserable, I shall be tempted to turn, and in the face of the pretty girl, give him a sound thrashing!" "O, Lieutenant Storme, you would frighten me to death. Indeed, I don't mind, only I fear he has something to blame me for, or he would never treat me so." Lieutenant Storme's heart melted at the sight of her pretty distress and trembling lip. "It may be he has been a little late, and some one has told him of our going out together, and the young scamp has seen fit to vent his vexation in this ungentlemanly manner; and in such a case the best way is to take no notice of him; he will come to his reason if he is worth the interest you take in him." Poor lone heard, but refused to be comforted. When they reached the riding hall, the ladies and officers con- cluded that was a case past help, a clear case of a propo- sition accepted, they both looked so demure. "Load at Will." When they were seated, Lieutenant Mera joined them. --"Miss lone, your aunt is half crazy about you, she has had criers out, all over the plain!"   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     97 "Weeping cadets!" interrupted Lieutenant Storme. -And has had a detachment detailed to fire a ten-inch columbiad, to bring you to the surface, if you had gone desperate and leaped into the river." "It would take more than a columbiad to bring Miss lone up, this afternoon," said Lieutenant Storme. "But really, is Viola coming to see the riding?" she asked. "Yes. Fearing her last remark had offended you, she thought you might have gone off on a high horse; she will soon inspect the riding- hall assisted by Lieutenant Saberin." lone looked troubled. "She could not think that I would be offended at that; she meant it for my good, no doubt."  "But, Miss Ione, all do not attribute such disinterested motives to the interference of others, particularly if- shall we let Lieutenant Storme into our family secrets?" "It is no secret,-what were you going to say?"

Lieutenant Smith whispered to Ione, ' The fourth cadet is Smith, Miss Ione." She looked at him just in time to catch one glimpse of recognition, but no bow. Not a moment did she lose sight of him, even the entrance of her aunt, who touched her shoulder as she seated herself behind her, did not attract her notice. Cadet Smith's horse was very vicious - one hle had chosen -as their standing entitled the young men to a choice - among the high-bred animals this important Post always commands. He rode well, took the ring eve- ry time, cut the heads with a will, and his " firings" were terrible to the unstrung nerves of the uninitiated Ione. Two cadets were thrown, but she did not show much alarm until his horse, on starting out, reared, plunged, reared again, and fell, falling on Mr. Smith. Tile dra- goons soon brought the horse to his feet, but poor Cadet Smith lay senseless. The cavalry officer ordered a litter brought, and he was lifted like a dead man, and taken 'from the hall. lone had risen at first, and now stood holding by the iron railing, as white as marble. Not one sound escaped her lips until most of the people were gone, she then ask- ed in a suffocated tone, "Do you think he is killed?" "No, Miss lone; pretty seriously injured though, I imagine; shall we go?" "Where is Viola? I have not seen her." "She has just left your side, with Lieutenants Saberin and Mera." They left the hall, but her aunt and her escort were far up the hill, so they did not overtake them before they were at the hotel. At the door, Lieutenant Storme left lone, saying he was sorry their afternoon should have commenced and ended under such unpleasant circumstances."

She found Cadet Smith a dead weight on her heart. She was anxious to know how severely he was injured. She took off the brilliant dress she had put on with such pleasure, folded it, and put it in her trunk, wishing never to see it again, she put on a black one, which Viola had beggred her not to wear again, as it made her look like a sister of charity or a wi- dow.  She looked like both, as with her hair drawn back in bands, her plain collar and sable robe, she descended to the piazza, where she found Viola, talking with a lady friend about the party.  "What should they wear, who should they see?"  Mrs. Bobaline said, "Well, lone, have you gone into mourning because Ca- det Smith was thrown from his horse?". "Yes, Viola, have you heard if he is alive?" "Why did you take off that lovely dress? you always choose such unbecoming dresses to wear to parade." "Please don't chide me, did I not dress within an inch of my life, to go out with Colonel Storme?" "I think  you are looking very saintly," said Miss Priest. "What will you wear to Mrs. Colde's party?" I don't know what; I have some dresses mamma pack- ed for me." Miss Priest looked as if she did not believe her. "( When she decides, you must make her show it to me, Mrs. Bob- aline; her dresses are so unlike ours, they have quite an oriental air about them." With this elegant compliment, Miss Priest said good morning to them.

"What you said? I never told him one word. He came to me and said you were afraid I was offended at your last remark, and was in search of me. I only said you could not think I was angry, as you meant it all for my good. The conversation then turned into a joke, and nothing more was said. Mrs. Bobaline seemed annoyed. Mera had shown him- self very acute, for from her, instead of lone, he had elicited the entire conversation. lone laughed, and begged her not to mind, but come out to parade.

"4 Position of the two Ranks in the Oblique Fire to the Right." Mrs. Bobaline went to speak to some friends, and left lone, in West Point parlance, " supporting a tree." A party took their station in front of her ; they were talking of the terrible accident which happened in the riding-hall. One very pretty girl said, t"Yes, he was my-favorite ca- det. Last year he was very polite to me, escorted me everywhere, and to think of just getting here in time to see him killed, is too aggravating. He saw me, and bow- ed so sweetly." Her party seemed quite interested, un- til she came to the sweet smile, when they all laughed. She blushed, and asked if her father had heard how much he was injured. He said he had not, but would ask the surgeon when he saw him. "Do, papa, there he comes, now."   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     101 On being questioned, the surgeon said he could not give a definite decision; he was badly hurt, but reckoned he would not die, and glancing at the young lady's interested face said, "He seems to have some one to live for." The ladies begged to know what he said; but lie replied very  pompously. O, but doctor, did he mention any names? just tell me the name!" persisted the girl. "No, no, Miss, I cannot- tell the name! It might be yours, and it might not; and I fear he would not thank me in either case, if he got well." That "if" sank deep into Ione's heart. The conso- lation of knowing that she had not offended him, was de- nied her. "Too late!" she murmured. ' He, poor fel- low, lies raving of some one he loves, and they are far away ; no one but strange men to take care of him!" She shivered at the thought. She sought her aunt, and saw her walking toward barracks with her friends. lone strolled toward the hotel, round the little path that winds on the brow of the hill; she left the direct one to avoid the file of ladies and gentlemen slowly wending their way up to tea. She lingered to look at the lovely sunset clouds, the dark mountains, the pretty little village buried in the bo- som of the hills - the island home of the gifted ones-- which, brought visions of another little struggling heroine, in the "Wide, Wide World," to lone's mind. As she stood, all became quiet. The cadets had gone to their noisy " mess," the band, with their glittering instruments, the drum-major's nodding plume and measured tread had descended below the hill, the officers' quarters opened to admit the groups of chatting friends; and the hotel had received into its brilliantly lighted hall, and its dimly lighted, but dangerous piazza, the many; and Ione stood alone, wondering that she was not happier, or rather why she was so miserable, where there was so much that was beautiful, to admire. She turned, surveyed the plain, and saw the twinkling lights that sparkled beneath the trees, in front of the fine quarters, and wondered if it were joy- ful and happy within those walls, as they appeared a few    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6558-00000051"/> 102          Tactics; or, moments before, at that beautiful spectacle,- the evening parade.

Some one at her side continued: Heart-wearied thou wilt own, Vainly that phantom woo'd, That thou at least hast known, What is true solitude!" She recognized Lieutenant Saberin's voice and fine form, in the deepening twiiolght. She smiled, and asked, "Did your lady love teach you that, Lieutenant Saberin?" "My lady love!   'From   early youth War has my mistress been, and though a rugged one, I'll constant prove, and not forsake, e'en now!' " "Surely you love some one better than War, do you not?" "O, no! Minerva will not have a rival.   When you swear allegiance to her, all other idols must be dethroned." "And where comes in a mother's love?" "My mother? Already for her son her tears of bitterness Are shed. When first I had put on the livery Of blood, she wept me dead to her!" "4 How heartless!" "t Southey said it, Miss Ione; I only echo it!"

She laughed: "Do you know that I am dreadfully hun- gry?" "Poor Miss Ione! May I not take you in to tea?" She declined, but he insisted, and they entered the glar- ing hall together. The picture was scarcely inferior to the one just left. The beautiful young girls, the elaborate- ly attired matrons, the gay uniforms and fine figures of the officers intermingled, formed a most charming tableau vi- vant! The supper table was almost deserted, and they seated themselves at the north end of the tthle, so that they could look up the river and see the beautiful moonlit clouds. lone was too intent on her supper, and content with her fascinating companion, to see the envious glances of mammas and daughters, as their promenades caused them to pass and repass the doors and windows; but Lieutenant Saberin saw it, and felt that if he was not making a very deep impression on Ione, he was on the spectators. After she had satisfied her West Point appetite, Lieu- tenant Saberin proposed a promenade on the piazza. As they arose she percieved, for the first time, that they were not unobserved, and laughingly said " others have enjoyed our tete-a-tete as much uas we; why did you not close the door?" "I was very unselfish, I opened the window, that you might enjoy the divine, and left the door open that others might have the same privilege."

She said yes, she thought she would. He asked if he might es- cort her thither, as Lieutenant Mera intended proffering his services to Viola. She hesitated, then accepted, but thought how will Viola like this? What can have made him ask me, and Lieutenant Mera to ask her? I know she does not want him, and am still surer this fine gentleman cares nothing for me. If I only had the power to divine their motives!  While she was occupied with these thoughts, Lieuten- ant Saberin was equally busy. What a queer little char- acter this is; she must be perfectly indifferent to me, she accepts my invitation as a matter of course, and will not take the trouble to converse. "I wonder if she is rich?" He glanced down at the slight figure at his side, the glossy hair, the rich bands, the high white brow, the exquisite mouth and chin, the round white throat encircled by the spotless linen collar, caught by a cross of diamonds. "Strange!" murmured he, caught by the same thing, "that I should not have noticed, that she can be no ple- beian." Sure enough. The beautiful ornament glowed like a lunary rainbow in the moonlight, while the sweeping( folds of her black dress, gave her the high-born air he had but that moment detected. "There is none of the plebeianll about the graceful bend of that intellectual head, and dig- nified carriage of those pretty shoulders; and if not rich, she is certainly high-born." Piqued by her silence, he went on, 4"What the deuce do I care ; she can't compare with regal Pauline!"But, Lieutenant Saberin! is not this little black-robed image the first woman that ever treated such advances as you have made, with such indifference?"Yes, but she shall, she must be conquered, she must recognize my claims to every woman's devotion." t"Commence Firingz."

Ione spoke first. "A penny for your thoughts, Lieutenant Saberin." "What was Miss Ione thinking of? Her thoughts will be worth repeating; while my gloomy cogitations could give little pleasure ; please, Miss Ione!" She paid little heed to the killing manner this was said in, but answered without reserve, "4 I was thinking wheth- er we would be the happier if we knew the motives that pompt every act; and if our esteem for each other's char- acters would be raised thereby, if we knew the why of all their acts?" "You would be infinitely happy in such a case; you do not doubt motives surely!" drawled he affectedly, as one would with a forward child. She did not notice it. "Well, please tell me why you invited me to go with you to Mrs. Colde's party, and not Viola?" "Simply, because I wish the pleasure of your society! motive - Selfishness underscored!" 4 I think that is nearly always the ruling motive, with gentlemen? Is it not? yet Wordsworth says, ' It is a joy, to think the best we can of human kind.'

She felt the glance, but ere its influence had formed the tender reply, she thought of " she's ambitious, Mera! she's ambitious!" and turned away her head. "The best I can? O yes, that is not asking much!" He stopped, and leading her to the edge of the piazza where the moonlight shone on her face, he leaned his elbow on the railing, his head on his hand, and looked in- to her face with his peculiar smile, while he scrutinized her closely. She bore it bravely, looking off on the river, as if she was unconscious that his eyes rested on her. He said:  "So, I am not asking much!

The color went and came in her cheek during these re- marks, her eyes flashed, then fell beneath his bold look, she dared not trust herself to reply, she felt paralyzed, had not the power to raise her eyes, but stood a marble imper- sonation of helpless indignation. Perhaps it was well she did not look at him, for he never looked better, his black eyes blazed like two small torches, his high white brow, partly shaded by his cap, be- neath which lay the dark clustering curls, dashes of silver light on them, where they were touched by the moon-light, Idis gracefill attitudes-all would have captivated the imag- ination of the young girl.

In his retreat, he met the Colonel, "O, Saberin; you are just the one I want; Storme, and Burlyton, and I, are going round to Dumpain's, and we want you to go with uS." "Thank you, Colonel, I have letters to write, and my lessons this evening, and I must be excused," "4 Never mind the letters and the lessons, come along, Saberin?"

Wednesday morning she concluded she would take a walk down to the hospital, to get something for a headache, from the steward, and casu- ally inquire after the young gentleman that was hurt ir the riding hall. After giving her something for her own affliction, the polite steward informed her that the young man was a lit- tle better, but still very bad. Her aching head was about in the same condition, - it certainly felt less tight about the temples, when she knew that he was neither dead or dying! She would send to New York and get him some flowers, they would cheer his solitude. The question now was, how'and when could she get them?

She sat and worshipped them, and blessed Mrs. S. Such rosebuds, heliotropes, lilies of the valley, ge-aniums, calycantlhus! Were there ever such clusters of sweetness mingled before? No, clearly no! Her trembling hands arranged them in a box, directed them to "Cadet Smith, Hospital," the air was intoxicating with their fiagrance. The boy was dispatched with them and she found it parade time. She hastily snatched one dress after another from the trunk, and chose a rich cherry silk, trimmed with golden flowers. She thought, it is very bright, but Viola says this is my first appearance, and she did not wish to be ashamed of me. Lieutenant Saberin is so very grand, he will subdue it. She ran down to tea, and found Viola already there, talking to Lieutenant Mera, who drew a chair near him for lone. "So you are one of the sensible young ladies, who can eat if they are going to a party." She replied, "f It takes more than a party to spoil my ap- petite." "Yet you seem greatly elated." "Yes, but it is not the party." "The escort!" said Mrs. Violetta. "It requires a woman to penetrate her sex," said Lieu- tenant Mera. lone blushed deeply, and said, "At fault for once, Vio- la. Judge not." The eyes of Lieutenant Mera rested on her, as if they would fain have penetrated the secret joy so apparent on her face. Tea over, they went to walk on the piazza, and met Cadet Allen. "O, Mr. Allen! how is poor Cadet Smith?" "Poor Cadet Smith! why, Miss Ione, he is the richest fellow in the corps to-night, any of us would change places gladly, with him,- a wealth of flowers! Such a friend as he must have!" , "Who may his kind friend be?" she asked, assuming great indifference.   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.     109 "Of course there was no name to it, but I think he suspects Miss Arnold; he murmured something like ' dear kind Lizzie!

"Perhaps he thought of her because he wished it to come from her, there was not a clue to them, no name," said he. fMrs. Bobaline laughed. "The more fool she!" "I wish I knew the sender, any way, I would cultivate her acquaintance," cried he, and bowed himself away. lone was mechanically saying, "Yes, it may be so," when Mrs. Maryglot, who seemed to be omnipresent, cer- tainly always near enough to join in any conversation go- ing forward, whether on the north or south piazza, either parlor or hall, now smirked up to lone, and whispered loud enough for every one to hear, "Never purchase love or friendship by gifts; when thus attained, they are lost as you stop payment." lone started. Mrs. Bobaline said, "What do you mean, Mrs. Marvglot? certainly not that lone sent the flowers?" That lady saw she had gone too far, and replied, " O, only a little good advice." lone saw she knew more than she chose to tell, and re- solved to question her little flower-porter, Mike. She as- cended to dress, but was not long making her toilet, and looked very lovely. A golden butterfly with ruby wing caught back her glossy hair on one side, to all appearances ready to take flight, and leave the rich waves to veil her completely. Viola sent to Tone's room to say Lieutenant Mera was waiting, and it was quite late ; Lieutenant Saberin had not come, would she go with them? She would go with them, and soon appeared, hooded and cloaked. She thought it very strange that he was late, but never imagined that he would not come at all.

Mrs. Bobaline was proud to say, "She 's my husband's niece, from South Carolina," - she had heard lone say she was born in Charleston. She was secretly pleased with lone for not caring that Lieutenant Saberin had not come for her, remembered the happy face at tea, and the flowers; and putting that and this together, was confident she was not at fault now, and - " lone liked Cadet Smith!" Lieutenant Mera thought lone a vision of loveliness, and so thought another tall individual rather elegantly leaning, half concealed by the sweeping folds of the long lace cur- tains, that draped the window. He was talking to a lady who seemed rapt, but not too much so, to lose sight of the handsome Lieutenant Mera and the exquisite Mrs. Boba- line, and draw the attention of his lordship to them. He looked and wondered at the superb dress of the " ambi- tious," young lady. He was surprised to see her fairly eclipse the "' regal Pauline," her jovous face told the vain man that her heart was in the right place, and not out skirm- ishing for him. His eyes followed the party to Mrs. Colde, lie saw a yellow light gleamn from the hazel orbs of the fashionable Miss Vera Colde, a sister of the Lieutenant, who kept a strict account of every woman entering the lines of the forces stationed at that post. She was staring at lone, as an old lady would at a comet, seen for the first time, just over her head, " as if her soul had suffered an eclipse!" lone released Lieutenant Mera, who danced with Mrs. Bobaline, and she was left to the tender mercies of Miss Vera Colde.

She took it, and as they moved off asked, '; Please tell me, Lieutenant Mera, who that young lady with the Vera peculiar name is; I verily believe she knows Othis blessed minute more about me than I know about myself." O, Miss lone, how Vera severe! that is one of our belles; she excels in the dance, but I ought to have warned or saved you from that catechising ; we all succumb to her and yield up all our hoarded secrets, as tamely as the prey of the famous Miss Ann O. Conder, yields their breath!" 6"You call me severe, and say such things!" "There are clouds of witnesses to corroborate what I say; beware!" The music began, and lone saw Lieutenant Storme and Miss Nora Kearney were their vis-a-vis. Lieutenant Mera bowed to lone, and then to Miss Nora, in a very finished manner; and lone quite delighted him with her grace and knowledge of the dance. Lieutenant Saberin, still unseen by her, watched with great pleasure the glidings of the little figure. Could she possibly forget that he was in existence? Very likely; carried away by the novelty of her situation, it might be the perfection of her cunning to pretend not to see him, -she knew he was there, or she would be looking toward the door, for him. She would do that from mere curiosity - to know why he had not come for her. The laughing nod that Lieutenant Mera was just then giving, was in answer to Ione's question, "Has Lieutenant Saberin come yet?     <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6558-00000056"/> "2         Tactics; or, "Lieutenant Saberin is here, and standing at the ex- treme end of the parlor, conversing with Mise Kate Kear- ney, or Miss Tute, or some one - but, by George! it is not you. Shall I call him?" and he bowed low before her. She was amazed at the dark, flashing eyes he raised to ler face. "Certainly not!" He offered her his arm for a promenade in the hall. As they left the parlor he said, "Are you quite content here, so far from your home?" She sighed a very little sigh: "My home, my home, my happy home!" she warbled under her breath. "Tell me about your home." "There is very little to tell, Lieutenant Mera. My home is beautiful, and my mamma is in it to-night without her Ione, and I am a little homesick." "Shall I take you to Madame Bobaline?" asked he, in his measured tones. "Why, no! You are very funny, Lieutenant Mera!" laughed she. "Thank you, Miss Ione! are funny people apt to make their friends home-sick?" Queer, I mean; you have not made me home-sick." He led her to the sofa, and asked her to excuse him a moment. She replied, " certainly," very much perplexed by his manner. The gay Lieutenant Storme rushed up, "O, Miss Ione, make me the happiest of mortals, by permitting me to dance with the loveliest of women!" She rose and made a very low courtesy with the gravity of a dowager-queen, and laid her hand on his arm. She felt very grateful to him for taking her just then, as she thought Lieutenant Mera had to resort to a ruse to get rid of her; and while watching the whirling figures in the redowa, was feeling that she was a stranger, in a strange land.   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.     113 "1st. Front rank. 2d. Aim. 3d. Fire. 4th. Load." Lieutenant Mera made directly for Lieutenant Alton. "I would like to have your assistance in relieving Saberin; I would like to introduce him to a friend, and he has been stuck with Miss Bessie Kearney ever since he came." "Stuck! I am not sure he won't knock me once for my officiousness. How do you know he would like to be reliev- ed?" with the blandest smile in his light blue eyes. 4"That's not the subject under consideration just at pres- ent, Lieutenant Alton; we will leave that for a collateral investigation," drawled he in the most measured tones, as they confronted the object of their observation. Miss Bessie bowed a lovely salute to the young gentlemen, and thought herself a belle. Lieutenant Alton generously un- dertook the relief, while Lieutenant Mera stood, and did ex- ecution with his eyes. Lieutenant Saberin not understand- ing anything but an intrusion, was vexed to notice the pleas- ure Miss Bessie evinced, at the addition to their party; but unwilling, at any cost to his feelings, to be the " mournful third " in any place, said with a subdued voice, "I have been very selfish, Miss Bessie!" and left her. Lieuten- ant Mera allowed him to get away a few steps, then fol- lowed, 'Ad, Saberin! I would like to introduce you to a friend of mine, if you have no objections." "Certainly not, my dear fellow, where is she?" He led him into the hall, and round into the door of the front parlor, to the sofa. They confronted my lady Mary- glot seated just where he had left lone. A broad smile played over Lieutenant Saberin's face, - Lieutenant Mera muttered "Le Diable!" "Thank you," said Madam,  I have the pleasure of his acquaintance!" Lieutenant Saberin threw back his head and gave a very undignified "Ha! ha!"Lieuten- ant Mera echoed it on a very high key. "You seem amused! Think'st thou, I could live. 'So long in this bright Eden, And not know its master-spirit?

Think on that: and Let mercy reason justice! '  Lieutenant Mera bowed maliciously. "I leave you in good hands, Lieutenant Saberin, I'll bring the gentleman to you." Lieutenant Saberin did not know that he intend- ed to bring him to lone, but saw he evidently did not ex- pect to see Madam Maryglot, and enjoyed his discomfiture very much. Mrs. Maryglot pulled his sleeve as lie seated himself by her, "Look! look! at lone Smith dancing with Lieutenant Storme, she looks like an houri; why are you not dancing with her, instead of getting into the clutches of Apollyon?" "4 Madam, I dare not trust myself near the blaze, lest I get my wings singed!" said he solemnly. "Don't like that red dress?" She exclaimed indig- nantly, "I think it beautiful! if your wings get no worse singing than that little angel would give them, you will have to be shy of such introductions as your friend gave you a few moments ago." "I could face the cannon's mouth, with my friend's friend as the artillery-officer, easier than trust my untried soul amid suchl dangers!" cried he heroically. "Where were the glory of an even combat? The splen- dor of a victory is where the odds are fearfully against one." "But, Madam, there are cases where a victory would be a vexation of soul, and it would be more manly to suf- fer defeat, than to conquer! What could I do with such a prisoner?" "Imprison her in your heart's core ; and if she is not hap- py, hang her round your neck!" "Mrs. Maryglot, lam not a killing man! Tell all this to Lieutenant Mera; one of his subduing glances would en- slave her for life!" His eyes followed her as she left the parlor with Lieutenant Storme. "You know where the   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     115 citadel is ably garrisoned, the beauty of an assailant can- not effect a great deal!" Mrs. Maryglot's curiosity was aroused. "Now tell me Lieutenant Saberin, have you a sweet-heart? and is this bona fide constancy in you?" He laughed at her eagerness; "Now Mrs. Maryglot, is this bona fide interest, or - or -- "'Interest, indeed! anything, only tell me Where does she live? Who is she? Rick, I'll wager." "Yes, Madam! rich in charms; dark and royal as the queen of night! A Southern bird in gold and purple plumage," said he, really warmed at thought of Pauline. "By George " exclaimed she indignantly, "' Not a kill- ing man! Gone down South and manacled some beauti- ful young creole, and come back here with your eyes full of ink, and your heart full of ebon tresses! Now I give you fair notice, if I see you pointing the smallest of your arrows at our bird of paradise, I'll tell her about your black bird bird down South." Lieutenant Saberin was very much amused with Mrs. Maryglot, and would have lingered by her side a good part of the evening, had not the Colonel come and be- seiged him, to dance with a stranger, his vis-a-vis. He found that the Colonel was dancing with lone. The young lady to whom he was introduced was very pretty; lie bowed in the most formal manner to lone, never addressing one word to her, but executed the " manual of arms" in splen- did style, with his partnler. "Ione did not show that she felt this treatment, but there was a little rebellion in her heart.

Ione wished herself at home many times; and when the march announced supper, the Colonel was gone, and she had no escort, and was nearly alone in the parlor, when Miss Ve- ra Colde came like an icicle, to her side, with a glare of surprise, offered her arm, to take her to supper. "You    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6558-00000058"/> "6         Tactics; or, alone!" conveyed as much as lone could well bear. They entered the room, she found a seat .beside Mrs. Brown, and Lieutenant Burlyton came and brought them cream. All the young ladies were chatting so gaily with agreeable officers, or in cheerful groups, but lone felt alone. She left the refreshment room with Mrs. Brown, and lis- tened to a sad amount of gossip. At length Mrs. Brown, feeling fatigued, grasped Lieu- tenant Brown by the coat-tail as he was passing her, with one of the professors, to the supper room again ; and insist- ed upon being taken home immediately. They went with lone to Mrs. Violetta; Lieutenant Mera came to them, and they were soon on their way home. Mrs. Bobaline was very quiet. She had seen nothing of the " star of the evening." If she was in one room, he was unavoidably in another,--he had not once sought her. lone was silent too - fatigued, and angry at Lieu- tenant Saberin's treatment of her. Lieutenant Mera was enough for all. He had evidently fortified his spirits with "seven others, more wicked than himself." His tongue was loosed, and his usually measured tones were made to skip like lambs. He made love to lone, and fun of Mrs. Bobaline, in a most reckless style. Madam did not deign a reply, and attributed his behavior to the right cause. lone paid little heed to his flattery, but could not but be amused at his wit and brilliancy. As he said good night he took a rose-bud from his coat and gave it to lone, say- ing very gravely, "Well, Miss lone, keep this in remem- brance of all I have said to night. I have meant it all." She took the bud, and turned to follow Violetta, who had gone instantly to her apartment, when he whispered "Stay, Miss lone! here are a pair of lovers, sure enough!" She looked and saw Lieutenant Saberin and Madam Maryglot coming up the steps. Madam cried out, "Contez-nous je vous prie, ce qui s'est fait?" "Ce n'est pas la question a faire!" retorted Lieutenant Mera. "Je n'aine pas, cet homme-la," whispered she, aloud, to lone. lone replied, "C'est mon meilleur ami!" Lieutenant Mera bowed to   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.    117 the floor, "Vous 9tes bien bon! "Quel dommage," sneered the old lady. "Adieu, jusqu 'au revoir," said Lieutenant Saberin, in a very melancholy tone, and gave his hand to lone. She courtesied low without taking it, and went up stairs. Mrs. Maryglot clung to her dress, vi- tuperating the whole affair, in every known tongue. "Cease Firing." As lone's door closed that night, it shut in as sad a heart as could be imagined. She sat down on the side of her bed, and inquired what Lieutenant Saberin could mean. How could he behave in such an unmanly man- ner? In San Francisco, her most casual acquaintance would call him to an account for it. Indeed, in any civil- ized society he would be held responsible. She would treat every man on West Point with the indifference they deserved, and henceforth she would look to something else than these " braves" for her happiness; and she threw the bud Lieutenant Mira had given her in such a spiteful way, that when she saw it disappear in the toe of her little slipper at the side of the bureau, she laughed outright, and took it out tenderly, and told the pretty thing, that it was only its misfortune to have fallen into the hands of a naughty man, she would put it in water for its own sweet sake, making a cologne-bottle serve as a vase. Although lone's fit of vexation ended in a laugh, she was none the less resolved to wage war with the braves as she had named the officers, and the very determined little face she confronted in the toilet-glass certainly did not look like forgetting those vows, ' ere the dawn of the morning!    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6558-00000059"/> "8         Tactics; or, "TO FIRE BY RANK.

There was not a smile nor even a look of recognition for those she knew at table, except Mrs. Maryglot. This was veily sweet, to shew those braves what they had forever lost! She was learning life's lesson of masking her best features, as a miser hides his gold. The bright smile drew a chair out at madame's side, and in a very motherly tone, t' How did you sleep, my dear?" "She slept well enough, but dreamed of icebergs, all night!" The good lady replied at the top of her lungs, "I fear my dear, you are finding the knight airs cold here!" lone's lips curled a little, and she said, ": You see I in- tend to defy them; I have donned my " 0Segis," and she drew a superb camel's-hair victorine closely around her should- ers, the long white waves sweeping over her white arnms and blue robe, made her remind you of- of- well - of an angel with her wings folded on her breast, but I most solemnly aver she was not conscious of all this.

Surprised that Viola was nowhere to be seen, she has- tened to her room, and found her still in bed. As she ap- proached, Mrs. Bobaline cried out in a very-well tone of voice, "Whose is that superb cape? let me see it, Ione!" She threw it to her aunt. "It is mine; are you sick Viola?"

"She could add nothing to Viola's comfort, so left her enjoying a cup of tea, a pyramid of toast, and three boiled eggs.

She re- membered Lieutenant Storme's advice, "These young gentlemen are not reliable!" and replied, "I'll ask Viola, anl if you come, perhaps!" she said lauaghing. "If I come? that's odd." She made no explanation, lie crave her a book he was reading, with a charming story in it - "Lady Lee's Widowhood."

As they ap- proached the seats, she saw Viola sitting there, and Lieu- tenant Saberin at the back of her seat, talking to her; she did not venture near the two people she wished of all others to avoid, but walked on down the front, and back to "Barracks."- Here she met Madam Maryglot.

Mr. Cozzens however modlified thleir terror by giving each of the gentlemen one of his glorious wel- comes. The Colonel had in his care a superb white embroidered crape dress, tied on' with Solfering sashes, one of the F. F. D. C's.

The old lady stared around her as if she was in a museum, quite mortifying Ione, by her perfect indifference to the attention she was attracting. W here is the soldier to show us a seat?

Here the cadets came in, and she sat up and stared in dismay, at the shout of command within the walls, the clang of sword and bayonet, the tread of three hundred men, as they marched to their seats. She asked the Colonel as the chaplain came in, "Is it customary to reserve the best seats for those boys? I supposed they were for the superintendent's family and other distinguished people." The cadets that heard her, laughed, and the Colonel eleva- ted his shoulders, and looked like a saint. Her investiga- tions did not cease till the fine voice of the chaplain re- sounded in her ears. "' The Lord is in His Holy Tem- ple." She was greatly impressed with his fine reading, and whispered to the Colonel to present her after service. They lingered long examining the painting. She won- dered if a mortal could be admitted to his studio. The flags - they had their right place-- were they arranged by the excellent taste of the Colonel? He regretted he must give the honor where it was due, "To an artist upholsterer from New York." x   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.      125 "I was in hopes I could compliment your taste in some- thing about the post, Colonel; what have you done?" "Here?" said he in a discomfited tone. "Anywhere, anywhere!"  He stroked his moustache and beard. "' Tell me of some of your feats in arms, were you never in a battle?" "No very renowned field," said lie deprecatingly. "Yet you conqured Mexico?" "Yes," said he, drawling a little, as if ashamed of the unequal contest. "; But you know Mexico is not formida- ble like England or France." "Oh, I know, but tell me about some of those battles, they were hugely trumpeted at the time. Were'nt you there?" "' Yes, Madam, but a - but suppose you tell me some of the feats your ladyship has performed," said the gallant Colonel. "' It reminds me, ' merit was ever modest known!" she replied drily. "Really now Madam, it would be delightful to hear some of--  "Arnold was one of your heroes, where is his tablet?" she asked maliciously, displeased at the Colonel pointing out the Yorktown flags. He showed her the blank tablet. She seemed struck with the idea, and repeated from her idol poet, "Thou art a traitor, and a miscreant, too good to be so, and too bad to live!" "Me, Madam? "ies it within the bounds of possible things, That I should lend my name to that word- "Traitor? '" "No, no! I was speaking of that other hero," said Madam, and left the chapel repeating "Is there not some chosen curse, Some hidden thunder in the stores of heaven, Red with uncommon wrath, to blast the man Who owes his greatness to his country's ruin?"    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6558-00000063"/> 126         Tactics; or, lone was conciliating the Colonel, who had lost his bland elegance of manner. Madam always ruffled his plulmes, as Lieutenant Burlyton cleverly observed. Dear reader were you ever becalmed? Mrs. Maryglot had been on the coast of Spain; and she likened the lIotel on a Sabbath after dinner to one in such a case! sihe could( not endure it, and ordered the carriage early, and the gar- qon tapped at Ione's door, "Madam was in a hurry." She found Lieutenant Mera looking as brilght as if he had been just bought at a hair dresser's, and in a deliglltful mood. They drove out of the Black-gate and up the Fort-Putnam road, while Lieutenant Mera entertained them with many stories about the points of interest; and Madam Maryglot was an inquisitor general at getting in- formation from all sources, and she found a pleasant and intelligent companion in the man she had pronounced a Boeotian. As they drove up under the trees in firont of the church, Madam exclaimed, "A  llhow lovely and home- like! A wee handful of old England set down in your untamed country." She was wild over it. After prayers she lingered reading every inscription, and left the " de- licious pet of a church " with a sigh. As they returned home, Lieutenant Mera asked lone if she had ever visited the cemetery at West Point. She had not, and they drove to it. Mrs Maryglot said as she had been there, she would leave them to walk home. lone admired the monuments, and wallderred among them, reading the inscriptions with a subdued enjoyment that greatly interested her companion. He led her to tile graves of the "' Innocents" to whose memory the churcl they had just left, had been raised as a monument. They sat down to rest, and Liuetenant Mera took from his pock- et Butler's poem on this grave-vard, and read in his low musical tones, one of the sweetest things ever written. "And here at last who could not rest contented; Beneath - the River, with its tranquil flood, Around - the breezes of the rmorning scented With odors from the wood.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     127 Above - the eternal hills, their shadows blending With morn and noon and twilight's deepening pall, And over head - the infinite heavens, attending Ultil the end of all." As he finished, the holy hush of the place was entranc- ing; the soft low tones, and sweetly solemn words, har- monized with the day. the hour, the scene; and now the distant notes of the band, at evening parade, stole over them with a dreamy blessedness, that lone recalled years after as an oasis in her West Point experience. They slowly wended their way back to the hotel. *; LESSON FIFTH." "Fire and Load Kneeling." lone's evident depression of spirits gave Mrs. Maryglot as much uneasiness as she was capable of feeling; accord- ingly, after she was arrayed for the evening, she tapped at lone's door saying, "Come pet." Her heart nearly rushed out at her eyes, at those "sounds of home," but she gave a little swallow, and squeaked out "Yes," and joined her queer, but sincere friend. Madam  leaned affectionately on lone's arm, as they rapidly " reconnoitered " as she said, to see, "' Who were where."   They walked twice around the piazza, and throeugh the crowded hall. Every eye followed Ione, whose heightened color became crimson, as they walked on, by hearing one lady remark to another, "She engaged to Lieutenant Saberin? I don't believe it! He would'nt have her." Madam put her arm softly around lone's waist, and dart- ing a look at the lady that reminded her of an old super- stition about the evil eye, she fairly growled, " O, yes, that's devilish woman! She must give her slap if it breaks the hearts of half her sex." "O, how I have coveted that lady's friendship!" said lone plaintively.    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6558-00000064"/> 128        Tactics; or, "Who is she?" asked Madam. "Colonel Tee's lady."  And the great drops forced themselves down her burning cheeks. Mrs. Maryglot drew her to the steps leading to the glen behind the hotel. "Now what a little einfaltig liebling," she said in a choked voice. Ione laughed through her tears. "What is that? do talk English to me, Mrs. Maryglot!" "O, that's nothing bad; its a sweet word. Liebling; darling, favorite, etc. Now why do vou cry?" "Oh! Mrs. Maryglot, I want somebody to tell some- thing to," and she sobbed outright. "Then tell me! I'm just the one to keep it, and coun- sel you. Well?" lone remembered that her mother had often said to her, "Aye, keep something to yoursel' ye ne'er will tell to ony," and trembled at the thought of confiding in a stran- ger; but still more so, at going on unguided by a wiser i brain than her own. She fairly threw herself into Mrs. Maryglot's arms. Oh! Mrs. ;i Marylot, I am -I am en- gaged to Lieutenant Saberin." Mrs. Maryglot really rejoiced at this splendid announce- ment, as she thought; looked at her with a quizzical face, "Well, and what is there so horrible about that? he is a magnums bonum  thrown down to you; and - and you're another; " and she hugged her very much as a bear would have done.                         "Oh!--Mrs. Maryglot- O,- But then you know,      i -I don't love him!--I'm   afraid of him! I Zknow he's not good!" "Oh!- ah! that's another thing!

"It's not Greek, child; but most excellent German. Why don't you understand German?"   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     129 "Because I never took a dozen lessons in the horrid language." "Well, well, you must begin at once to study it, it is the finest language in the world." (After a moment.) "4 Well, and you don't love him? what next.? Girl-like you love somebody else - eh?" Ione looked up very wildly. "Who told you so?" ' O0, there's nothing lost to him that sees, with an eye that feeling gave,'" madam replied adroitly, for she knew nothing about it. "4 Well, does everybody know it?" said the einfaltig liebling. "No, no! no one but me! But how in the name of the ' fierv Alps, rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death ' did you get engaged to him, without lov- ing him? I did not think you such a milk-sop, such a- a--" rattled on she, in a merciless way. "O! Mrs. --dear madam, pity me!" Madam looked like a stone jug, and the confession be- gan. "You see, Mrs. Maryglot, I thought like Mrs. Tee, that he was very high-minded, and--that I was doing some- thing grand, till I found I did not love him - that I was afraid of him, and then I knew I had sinned!a" and the sobs broke forth anew. Her friend took her hand, and caressed it. Ione leaned her hot cheek on madam's shoulder. '"What can be done, my dear friend? I'll write to mamma, to send right off for me!"Still no reply from her dear friend. Ione moaned piteously: At length Mrs. Maryglot said, "And who is the other?" "Oh, do not ask me that ' Perhaps I only think he is good, perhaps it's only because I am not afraid of him, and he don't care a pin for me." She sat down on the grass, dropped her hands in her lap in a very hopeless way, and began in a low voice; "For some reason I shrank from him froir the first; there was a curious impertinence in his eyes from the first time I ever met them.

I was flattered, and thongllt I llad formed groundless prejudices against him, but I fought my heart every step. One evening I ran down from my room to look for Viola or you, and saw no one ill the hall, but advancing hastily to the north door, I turned my head thinking I heard some one coming out of the par- lor, while hastening on, I ran right into some one's face; I gave a little cry, and Lieutenant Saberin caught me in his arms; he saw me coming, and stood at the side of the door, to frighten me. He said he had been waiting an hour for me. There was no one out there, and I was very in- dignant that he .should behave in that way, but he fell on his knees and called me - oh, a great many - everything - said I was his life - oh - you know! I was so sur- prised and tretnbled so that he thought it was all - love, I suppose. He held my hand and would not release it till I would become engaged to him. I said no, no--he plead for three weeks, and then if I did not like him - or, at  last, would 1 be engaged for fifteen minutes. I laughed, 1 and then he said we were engaged."            1 "V Well!" said Mrs. Maryglot.             . O O, well, I said nothing, and he said that meant, yes." "That, was when?" asked madam. "A week ago, but I have not walked 'with him, or scarcely seen iimn since, for I fear him. When he finds me alone, he calls me his petite- jolie fiancee, and says he likes me all the better for my shyness; but before others lie throws me kisses slily off his finger-tips." Here she  curled her pretty lips. "He says, now we are cheating c Lieutenant Mera, beautifully; and that is just what I don't want! O, I'm not engaged to him one bit; that is, my heart's not." Here site buried her face in her hands and wept bitterly. "I wish I was with mamma. I wilsh he was hung!" Mrs. Marvglot looked to her like an old toad, sitting on the rocks, with a brown and steel color shot-silk, her fat face, and great double chin, she appeared as uncon-   Cupid in Sholtlder-Straps.     131 cerned as if she were listening to the cry of the whippor- wil, she now turned her eyes on the tear-stained face of Ione, and broke into a laugh, that made the young girl almost spring from her seat. She laughed on, till Ione was offended. Seeing this, she very quietly said, "You have never before had a beau, as these girls call a lover, and I can assure you, Lieutenant Saberin was only play- ing with vou." Ione looked like an enraged lioness, at this flattering insinuation. "I am excessively angry at you, Mrs. Mary- glot!" and she turned her crimson face away from her searching gaze. Madam pitied her " liebling " too much to prolong her misery, so applied the knife at once, like a skillful surgeon. She saw that Ione was in his toils, though she was not aware of it, and determined to dethrone the fop at once from the heart of this sincere child of nature. "You see lone, if you were the daughter of a general, he would proclaim the engagement on the hotel-top, and lead you about like a captive queen; as it is, he is playing with your most sacred feelings." "But why should he disrespect me? I have always tried to deserve the respect of every one," whimpered she, with a look of despair. Madam laid the fingers of her fat hand tenderly on her cheek, "Be very thankful things are no worse, liebling; now if you really loved him and he were going to be hung, you can see, things would be much worse - ' but seeing the tears stealing silently over the rosy face, she added, "What do you care for the gavache! un ame de bone; you know what that is, ' a soul of mind,'- wait till I get at him." "O, dear Mrs. Maryglot, pray do not let him know that I have told you a word, for worlds. Indeed, I shall fly away home!" "A la bOte a bon Dieu, as the French call the lady- bug.

She mused lon, thinking, "What better could I do with my money than to give it to Ione, and make these prigs all scramble for lher, for they all admire her, as who can help it!" At last she said "I have a plan; you keep near me, all the time, and we will attach the prettiest girl we can find, to our party: and if he comes we will introduce him, and seize every opportunity to leave them alone." "4 Ah, Mrs. Maryglot, could I be so cruel; to get anoth- er into the same trouble I am in?" "Never you mind, little innocent, I'll get some one that has seen the world ' a bon chat bon rat.' " "All, Madam! ' Aquila non capit muscas.' " "Bon! bon! brava! ' when did you learn latin?" "You see I am learned, too. I wrote off a whole gram- mar when I was ten years old. But you wont do any- thing about this affair of mine, will you?" "O, I see. The idol holds his seat; but ' Bonis nocet, quisquis pepercerit malis,' and that means, ' He hurts the good, who spareth the bad,' leave him to me, for 'caeca regens vestigia filo,' or 'leading his blind steps with a thread,' O, wont that be b-l-i-s-s, now that I know my gen- tleman!" ' Mrs. Maryglot, you frighten me to death! Would to heaven I had suffered in silence!" "No harm  done, pet, I'll handle him gingerly; trust- me! ' She drew her to herself affectionately, then leaning on her arm, they walked to the river bank. The moon had risen, fairly eclipsing the twilight; and now Ione's spirits rose to the highest pitch, since she had once cast off' the burden of her young heart on such able shoulders, and she sang in a low voice, from Moore. "Hark, 'tis the breeze of twilight calling Earth's wearied children to repose; While round the couch of Nature falling, Gently the night's soft curtains close! Soon o'er a world, in sleep reclining, Numberless stars, through yonder dark,   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,       133 Shall look like eyes of cherubs shining From out the veil that hides the ark!

Grant that beneath thine eye securely Our souls awhile from life withdrawn, May in their darkness, stilly, purely, Like 'sealed fountains,' rest till dawn!" As they stood at the close of the song, Ione's hand clasped in Mrs. Maryglot's, madam compared the Hudson to the river of Damascus, named by the Greeks Chrysorr- hoas, or ' the golden stream,' flowing through the beauti- ful valley called the ' Orchard of Damascus,' told her of that famous city, which the Arabs consider the first of the four terrestrial paradises, believed by the Bedouins to be the most ancient city in being. "4 Now we are abroad, shall we, as Dr. Thompson says, quoting from  the Arabs, ramble on ' ala bab Allah, toward God's gate.' This they say when they neither know nor care where they are go- ing. "Ah, my love, we think we are mere automatons here, but alas! in Arabia they are daily, hourly insulted by those who love them best ; even little boys treat their moth- ers and sisters like slaves, and are esteemed the cleverer for it. The women wear such a profusion of ornaments, it would sicken you of them - thousands of piastres strung around their foreheads, in various coins; their shoes too, you would break your precious neck with them, wooden sandals, raised on bits of ornamented boards a foot high, they go clattering along." lone forgot her griefs, in those of her Arab sisters, and wished she were the Great Mogul, to punish the men for * their cruelty. Mrs. Maryglot affirmed there was no necessity of such a state of things if the women would only stand up for themselves, but it made her so mnad to see her sex "' show the white feather " at the very time they should exhibit proper spirit - the men would respect them more.

"Indeed, indeed madam, my heart is snug enough in the right place; I assure you the Lieutenant has not possession of it as he supposes." "There now, that is what they call caprice and cruelty ; becoming engaged, and hating and fearing them, all in the same breath!" madam replied with some severity. l"But you can see my dear madam, that I amn not en- gaged to him -   that I did not say yes, as he said I did, silence was not consent, was it?" "Of course not, but why had you not spirit enough to say you are very greatly mistaken, sir!" If I am not mistaken in the man, "He is strangely bewitched by that sort of renown Which consists in becoming " the talk of the town," And to hear from the gazing, and mouth-open throng, The dear words " that is he " as he trudges along, While beauty all anxious, stands on her tip-toes, Leans on her beau's shoulder, and lisps' there he goes!

Wllhyv don't you tell me as the king of Sparta told the ambassadors, the former part of your address was too long, that I have forgottenl--the latter  part, being unconnected in my mindle with what   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     135 you said before, I do not see the propriety- of that, and shall not feel bound to act upon it.' " lone said Madam was a great deal too wise for her com- prehension, she could not see the wit of the half she said. "Vi capisco perfettam6nte," replied the old lady. "Well," said Ione "Well, - what? The English, if you please; you forget that you must enlighten me when you speak in your foreign tongues." c' O, it seems so foolish that you cannot understand such a simple sentence! I said I understood you perfectly." :L "' Madam Maryglot, you are mighty provoking! How should I know what you are saying, when you are talking in every lingo that was spoken at the tower of Babel, in the same sentence." "4 Grazie!" replied the imperturbable lady. As they ascended the steps of the hotel they saw a group of strangers. A very pretty girl formed one of the party. Madam stoped the waiter-boy Mike, who was darting past. "Chi sopo quelle signore??" Mr. Mike was a great character, a great reader, a sub- scriber to the New York Ledger, and read that invaluable sheet, to waiter-dom assembled, every night. He was al- so whllat has been greatly eulogized, a good listener, and had often heard the learned lady discussed by the gentle- men in the office, and felt more elevated by the implied compliment lie conceived she was paying him, than he had ever been by the generosity of his superior officers.

Poor Mike! He seized his nose withl his doubled dexter hand and rushed past her, for the kitchen. Lieutenant Burlyton who was reclining on the balus- trade near, conversing with some ladies, stood up to look at the farce that was enacting, and when Mike disappeared, fell into a spasm of laughter.    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6558-00000068"/> 136         Tactics; br, Ione caught a glimpse of Lieutenant Saberin ascending the front steps, and esqaped to her room. She sought Vio- la in vain; and now she must retrace her steps alone.    "Why did I not stay by my old general, Mrs. Maryglot! Dear me, I will nestle under her wing all the time, yet I don't know what moment she will expose me, as she did about Cadet Smith's flowers: dear me!" and she leaned over the railing to see if Lieutenant Saberin had gone in to tea. He had not seen her in her flight, and went directly into the dining-room. Madam Maryglot losing sight of lone, bounced into tea, quite in a fury at being made " the laughing stock of fools,' as she informed the party on the piazza when she flourished away from them into the hall. Her indignation blinded her to the absence of her lieblingc till she saw Lieutenant Saberin enter alone, she then arose, went into the hall, and looked up at lone, who stood leaning with her elbow on the railing, her hand covering her eyes. Madam Mary- glot's great heart ached for her. "Ilone," she whispered, ' come, come!" lone started, and the brightest of smiles made her face radiant. She skipped down to her friend, and kissing her wrinkled cheek, followed her into the room, a blush man- tling face and neck, for she was sure every one at the table knew just Las much as she knew herself. She felt the burning glance of Lieutenant Saberin's dark eyes on her face. Mrs. Maryglot rehearsed her grievances to her in an undertone. She glanced at Lieutenant Burlyton, and his droll face quite upset her gravity, and she fell to devour- ing her crusts in a very unlady-like fashion, that the irate lady, might not detect the ii aid and comfort for the en- emny," lurking in the dimples of the corners of her mouth. Lieutenant Burlyton joined them as they left the table, and promenaded the piazza, by the side of Viola, to whom he portrayed in living, glowing colors, " the best thing of the season,"--Madam Maryglot addressing Mike in Italian. That earnest old lady, however, had her plans laid, and   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     137 was busily carrying them out.

"My better half, Lieutenant Mera; he was melted like gold in the crucible!" Madam Maryglot had by this time cried, "Ship ahoy," and "Whither bound?" etc., and as the rest of the ingre- dients were brought near, hastened to stir them together. i Ilone, my dear, this is Miss Randolph; Miss Randolph, Miss Smith. I thought Southern girls ought to know each other here! Lieutenant Saberin, don't run away, we want you."   The haughty cynic curled his eyes and lips, and knit his forehead; and had she been a man, would have curled his fingers too, at this great liberty, but came forward, and gave a lordly recognition of the intro- duction.

This was a treat indeed. Lieutenant Saberin left them to bring his friend, an officer who had promised that lone should visit the Observatory the first cloudless night after the new moon. They spent a delightful evening, thanks to the unwearied exertions of good Mrs. Maryglot, and at the hour appointed they took their flight to the moon.

The prospect of witnessing the Grand Review for the first time, drove all else from Ione's mnind. She was invi- ted with her aunt to the collation at the house of the Su- perintendent, given for the "Board of Visitors." Cadet Corridor had asked Ione to await his coming after review, and he would accompany her in to the Superintendent's. Mrs. Bobaline was seldom seen without two or three of the young officers, but he whose presence gave most pleas- ure, was rarely with her. This morning Lieutenant Sa- berin met her at breakfast, and said he hoped to meet her at the Colonel's. This brightened the day for the poor lady, and she was radiant; that meant that he would pay Iis respects to her there, and no pains were too great to adorn herself for such a triumph. Her chief charm was not her unexceptionable toilet, or perfect features, but an indescribable air of ele(ance, and a charmingly gracious attention to the person with whom she happened to be conversinr. She was surrounded by so many distingruish- ed gentlemen, that lone enjoyed the crumbs that fell from her " feast of reason," not a little. The review was very grand.  The throng of spectators, lining the side-walk in front of the "quarters," and on the path under the trees, from the academic building, to the flag- staff, formed an exquisite embroidery around the finely cut green-sward of the parade ground.

And now the miniature army scours the plain to the most inspiriting music; once, twice, three times. Ione's eyes danced with delight. In vain she tried to recognize Cadet Corridor, but when the "double-quick," brought them before her the last time, she was startled by a look of recognition she received from him, in an oblique glance. The review over. Lieutenant Mera joined lone, and asked if she was going in to the collation. "Yes, I am waiting for Cadet Corridor." "Really, that's a novel idea - for a cadet to engage a lady to go to a collation." Does that signify that he is to monopolize every word and smile, this afternoon?" "O no!" she replied, "I suppose he thought it would be pleasant for me to be sure of some one to bring me cream.") "Anxious you should not lose your cream? I reckon he was only anxious not to lose the cream of the guests him- self!" laughed he. "But I must go and get a drink; good-bye, Miss Ione," and he dashed across the road. He raised his hat as he entered the gate, looking as if it was no paradise, when leaving her outside. She started as she turned and found Cadet Corridor at her side, (' Oh, Miss Ione! ' present or accounted for ' in the body, but heart and eyes ' running it,' I will beat the long roll, and ' hive and court-martial, the truants!' 7 "What are you talking about? I don't understand one word!" said lone, as bewildered as possible. '6 Never mind, come, they will eat up all the goodies, before we get there." On entering the hall lone noticed a crowd of officers,   Nupid in Shoulder-Straps.       141 around a table apparently examining with great interest something on it. She asked what it was. "4 That? that's a great curiosity! It is an ancient bowl, used at the " fountain of youth," and is still supposed to re- tain its magrical properties, that is to say, it changes any liquid poured into it, into a rejuvenating beverage. You would be surprised to see the change its icy contents will effect on the staid,-- those that linger after the rest, I mean, - professors and officers. They lose the wrinkled brow of wisdom, and martial tread, and frolic and dance as if the prayer had been answered in their case. "Oh, for one hour of youthful joy! Give me back my twentieth spring! I'd rather laugh a bright-haired boy Than reign a gray-beard king! Off with the wrinkled spoils of age! Away with learning's crown! Tear out life's wisdom-written page And dash its trophies down. One moment let my life-blood stream From boyhood's fount of flame I Give me one giddy, reeling dream Of life, all love and fame!" While the youthful sage had been raising the curtain' for lone to peep behind the scenes, they had become wedged in, near the door.  As he finished his quotation, she glanced over her shoulder to watch the devotees around the Helicon fount; and saw a slender white hand raise a glass above the heads. A laugh followed the toast, and she knew the hand by a signet-ring she had seen Lieutenant Mera wear. "I wonder what the sentiment was," said she mechanically. Cadet Corridor had heard it, and replied, "'It was a mathematical joke, ' Here's to the mixed Professor -! ' " lone did'nt see it, but soon found herself a link in a chain of bowers and scrapers around my lord and lady Superintendent.

"No indeed, we are very fortunate," she replied. Sloe felt at ease, and the wit and easy flow of words on sim- ple subjects, gave a charm to her intercourse with cadets, she never knew when, in momentary fear of saying some- thing stupid, or not fearfillly interesting, she weighed each word before she spoke it to the officers. Cadet Corridor went to get lone some cream, when Lieutenant Saberin im- mediately took his seat. "4 Where is Viola?" said lone. "4 Surrounded, like Saturn, by worlds of admirers, till I, like an eighth moon, was compelled to move into space, as I could not get near enough to catch a gleam of her flow- ing robes." "But really, have you not seen her?" "Why, Miss lone, has she anything to tell me?" "O no, but she expected to meet you, and I fear she will be disappointed. How strange, that those we most wish to see, are the ones we never can see!" "In that case, Miss lone is as disappointed as her aunt!" "Please, please, Lieutenant Saberin, I did not mean any thing of that kind; but really, I would rather, it you could only see one of us, that she should not be disappoint- ed." "I understand, but cannot consent to be driven away, even by so lovely a compliment." Cadet Corridor returned, looking very wistfully at lis seat, so dangerously filled. Lieutenant Saberin showed no signs of vacating it, and he took his position at the back of her chair. She conversed about the strangers, ad- dressing most of her remarks to Cadet Corridor. At length Lieutenant Saberin arose saying, "Miss Smith, shall I have the pleasure of listening to the -music with you this evening?" in the most nonchalant way.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     143 She bowed her head in very much the same style, and drew a long breath, as Cadet Corridor resumed his seat. At parade Ione watched for the newly recognized position of her cadet friend, and found it by the most comical lit- tle signal that could be imagined, the slight movement of the white glove on the left hand. Ione's eves must have bolne testimony to the recognition as plainly to Cadet Corridor, as if she had waved hers in return. At supper lone saw plainly by Viola's manner, that she had not been entirely forgotten by Lieutenant Saberin. She liked him all the better for not having failed Viola, and when he came to her in the hall and said, "Miss lone, music has commenced," and offered her his arm, she vouchsafed a very sweet smile, which he did not attribute to the right cause. They did not speak, till they reached the iron seats. Lieutenant Saberin broke the silence. "Did you ever see such a night? this is happiness! Just look at the shadow of the trees on the grass! and the moonlight on the hills across the river. One ought to be very happy in this beautiful world." "One is, is not one?" she answered. "No; I am a great way from it. I do not know what the sensation is, it is so long since I have experienced it." "1 Lieutenant Saberin blue?" she exclaimed in a tone so like the one he remembered in Lieutenant Mera, the night before he got his leave to go to New York, that he started. ' I did not know that you were ever unhappy, if I were a man, I would throw sorrow to the winds!" "If you were a man; Miss lone, you would have no sorrow. The good are always happy!" "Then you cannot be very unhappy, you are not very bad are vou?" said she anxiously. "Yes, my profession is a killing one, you know! And then I must always be wishing some one out of my way as I would like to be promoted; so I don't see how I can be good like such as you! "You are just talking nonsense, there is nothing wicked in being a soldier, you know; and in deserving promotion I "    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6558-00000072"/> "4         Tactics; or, 4 Deserving? the deserving are not the ones that get it.

"Lieutenant Saberin, you are too metaphysical for me; I am afraid you are taking cold under the trees." 6 If' that solicitude were really felt hoow happy I should be. But in what am I metaphysical? what does mefa- physics mean, Miss lone?" She fairly grew out of patience and said quickly, "See metaphysics call for aid on sense."

"4 Then you do admire the stars and stripes? I admire our flag more than anything in the world, except a beau- tiful face," said he looking down at lone. She took no notice of the remark, and asked if he re- membered what the Chinese called it. "No; I regret I do not speak Chinese. Is that one of your accomplishments?" 4"No,but a friend of mamma's returned from China not longo sinee, and charmed us all with the force of their words. Our fla, they call a 'flower flag.'

"O, it is far too pretty to be thrown lightly away." "I understand; very nicely done, but I shall not accept the rejection, Miss Ione!" 4"Rejected, Saberin?" laughed Lieutenant Burlyton, as he ran past him up the steps of the hotel. "Yes, and most elegantly done!" lone found Viola holding a levee in the north parlor with Madam AMaryglot, the Colonel, Lieutenant Mera, and two of the Board. lone and Lieutenant Saberin joined the circle, and soon Lieutenant Burlyton came in to complete' the mirthful party, and songs, music,-and the " lancers,' closed the evening. "Rigoht (or left) Dress." "Guard mounting, breakfast, drill, dinner, parade, tea, serenade, on the piazza till eleven o'clock with Lieutenant Saberin."

She went everywhere. Mrs. Bobaline was very jealous, and said, "Let him alone --he is too intellectual not to tire of her; indeed, any man will tire of any woman after such a siege, and then he will be mine more than ever.

In the mean time shle was in- dulging in every variety of " small-sword" exercise thllat a jealous woman could inflict on the object of her envy, by putting Ione to torture in a thousand trifling ways. "To march to the Front." For a long time Ione avoided Lieutenant Saberin, and even told him that he was Viola's friend first, and should not neglect her, as it made them both unhappy. He re- plied that lone did very wrong to countenance a married lady in receiving the attentions of a young gentleman in her husband's absence. He would put his wife in a cage if she did not do right. This seemed very correct to her, and she gradually became resigned to her aunt's discom- fiture, and came to like the caressing deference shown her by her elegant beau. Lieutenant Mera treated her with dignified coldness when they met, leaving his friend master of the field, and attended Mrs. Bobaline every- where. A cold, rainy day imprisoned the ladies in-doors. There was no getting out. Ione wandered from door to window and back to door again, till Miss Celeste Randolph came down and challenged her to a game of chess. In a few moments two of the cadet officers came in to call on Miss Celeste, who introduced Ione. The gayest mirth was al- ready defying the storm without, quite divesting the house of the gloom which pervaded it, when Lieutenant Mera passed the window and glanced in. Presently the bell- boy handed Ione a card with "Lieutenant Mera-- In the north parlor," upon it. Why did the blood leave her cheek at receiving a card with that name on it? She would gladly have-flown in an opposite direction. She excused herself and went forth feeling like a culprit. Lieutenant Mera was surprised at the very rosy face that greeted him, "Pardon my intrusion, Miss Ione, but I hoped those young gentlemen were Miss Randolph's friends, and you are so seldom to be seen lately, that this moment seemed precious."   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,      147 This address sent the blood flyingr from Ione's face to helr heart, and back again to her brow, till it burned pain- fully. "I don't understand you," was all she could utter. "I fear I don't understand myself, lately." She stood before him as if he had come in on business. Slle raised her eyes, his were resting on her face with a strange burning light in them. Her cheeks glowed and her heart fluttered. "Miss Ione, will you give me this?" touching a little blue bow on hier hair. Slhe did not answer, but bowed her head to him. He tremblingly untied it from  her soft curls, letting them fall over her blushinlg cheek. He carefully rotied it saying, "I will keep this till Azrael wings me from earth - and take it withl me it' permitted." Like a devotee before an idol, with folded hands and downcast eyes stood poor lone.

He unfolded the pic- tures on the table. She'had no alternatiNve but to advance and examille them.   While thus engaged he said, "I should suppose you would become a fine linguist in a short time, you are so constantly under the tuition of Madam Maryglot.  Does she give you lessons in German?" "O h, no!   She speaks German to me sometimes, and then translates it for me," she replied quietly. "' Do you not remember any of it?" i O, yes, I know what liebling means, she says that so often to me," she answered smiling. "Suppose I be promoted to an assistant professorship, and finish that lesson?" She glanced at him inquiringly.

The large ring on his finger attracted her eyes just in time to open an escape from her perilous situation. 4"Lieutenant Mera, what an unique ring you wear, is it an heir-loom?. It is very curious." "This ring? It is a talisman: pshaw! a mockery! Yet I cling to the bauble, as if it were the key to my des- tiny!" le took it off and handed it to lone. "Tell me about it, please: - ' J. A.'

Miss Arnold - is it not hers?" Miss Arnold! Miss Ione Smith is the only Miss that has ever touched this ring -at least since it has been in my possession." "f Is it so sacred, then?

I have brought the doctor to tell you your health demands that you should take this trip. Everybody is so intolerably slow here. We have a grand party to go." "Who?" asked Lieutenant Saberin, laying down his book. "I don't know," said the doctor, "I'm not even ac- quainted with the young lady I'm expected to play the skillful to!" "Who is it, Storme?" laughed Lieutenant Saberin. "Miss lone Smith." "i Yes, Smith is the unique name." "And who else?" questioned he of Lieutenant Storme. "Mera is going to take my cousin, Maria Hamilton. Nora Kearney goes with your humble servant, and ma petite soeur has no escort." "  Then I shall be most happy, if you can swear to the petite. When did your sister and cousin come, Storme?" "Last evening. Be at the hotel at four o'clock and I will introduce the little one to you. He left Lieutenant Saberin and the Doctor together to report progress to the ladies. The doctor lighted a cigar, tipped his chair back, raised his heels on the window-sill, and said. "I rather tell thee what is to be feared, Than what I fear.

"Keep a stout heart doctor; we may escape unscathed, and slip the net that's dropped for us! Have you seen Storme s sister?" "Yes, I saw her this morning, at guard mounting, where tils unfo(rtulate affair was concocted. I invited lher to go wit]h me, but she expected then to go with Alton, so I was portioned off to Miss Smith. Tllen Alton beggroed to be excused, and you have got the one I prefer, and I have your choice, if what I hear be true, my only conso- lation is, they sav she is rather brilliant." "Well now, Oglevie, such being the case, I propose a compromise. We'll start all fair, you get introduced to Miss Smith and I will to Miss Storme, we will stay by them in the boat, but on the other side, we will change off. How would you like that?" O, very much." "t Who told you Miss Snith was brilliant?" "Miss Kearnev said when Miss Storme refused my in- vitation on account of her brother having spoken to Al- ton, ' Never mind, there's Aliss Smith take her; she has as much money as a clover has lhoney.'

Lieutenant Saberin looked at his -watch. "Four o'clock, I declare; we shall be late." He arose, soaped his movus- tache, and they set out. They met the party at the hedcge. Lieutenant Saberin was presented by Iieutenant Storme to his sister and cousin, and the doctor to Ione ; but Lieu- tenant Mera 'was at her side and did not leave her till they rached the boat.

You were thinking, ' I wonder if I shall like him as well as the doc- tor! ' " '"Now the answer, Lieutenant Saber." -I'm not so sharp, as you think me, Miss Storme, I am only a Saberin!" Miss Storme laughed merrily, "I shall always call you Lieutenant Saber, you were so keen as to divine my thoughts!" As they arranged themselves inl the boat, Lieutenant Saberin blessed the doctor for his adroitness, for he found himself wed(red in between Miss lone and Miss Storme. He had full scope for his fine powers of entertaining, as the doctor seemed perfectly indifferent to all the party. They probably thought the doctor absorbed in some pro- found problem in his profession, but he was not so much more profound than the rest of mankind; he was study- ing the diagnosis of the affection of the "brilliant," for Lieutenant Saberin, and said to himself, "She may ad- mire him, but she loves some cadet, I suppose ;" so did not put hmself out of the way to neglect her, for the sake of Minielhaha, as Lieutenant Storme called his laugh ing sister; but went in quite a professional manner fi'om one to the other, as if they were sick and needed his most humane attentions. He fulfilled his agreement, to walk up with Miss Lou. But as soon as they reached the foot of the falls, and were finding seats, the, doctor said, ("Here Miss Smith, this is a pleasant one," and seated himself at her feet. It was a relief to talk to a stranger. In spite of lier determination to enjoy herself, shle found her head full of unpleasant thoughts. Cadet Smith had just got out of tlhe hospital but avoided her.

Accustomed to understand the tones of the voice, he said, "You are tired, and must have something. What have you in that basket?" cried he to Lieutenant Storme. "Some good things generally Doctor Oglevie; wlat will you have?" "Well, let's have some good things generally!" Lieutenant Saberin arose and opened the basket, and laving a naplin on the ground, he piled one tling after another upon it. ' ere are sandwiches, tarts, cake, lem- ons, sugar, tumblers and bottles." "All, I will take a cork-screw, Lieutenant Storme, if you have one, and now all draw round the festive napkin," said Lieutenant Mera. Lieutenant Storme proposed that the ladies should not be permitted to taste a drop of the nectar, until each had sung a song. A glass was filled and held towards Miss Storme. "A song, a song," called the gentlemen. "N)t one drop until ,ou sing, Miss Storme," holding the brimn- ming little Bohlemian glass above ler llead, threatening to pour its contents on lier. She sang out in a very music- al voice, "A great big bar, came out de wilderness, out de wilderness, way down in Alaba - bamrn - bamrn - way down in Alabam." Lieutenant Storme joined in the chorus, with a fine bass. Lieutenant Saberin, perfectly delighted with the gay little lady, knelt as he handed her the glass, saying very sentimentally, "It was very wrong To say I would deny thee anything, Be not angry with me, for though God Forgive me, I could ne'er forgive myself, If I brought sorrow to thee - could I?" "( False flatterer, cease!" said she wavina her glass at him.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,       153 He pressed his hand to his heart, and said, "It is my fate To love, and make who love me hate."

"No, 'tis to sue--to gain - deceive- To tire of-- to neglect - to leave ; " Said lone, looking most meaningly at Lieutenant Mera. "I vow, I'll lhang myself," said Lieutenant Saberin, "and never speak to a woman again!" ("A toast to the ladies from Lieutenant Mera," said Doctor Oglevie. "I object," cried Lieutenant Mera, "' The doctor must not select the theme; his own toast shall be to the la- dies! '" handing him the glass. "No," said the doctor, "' Mera first! we'll never let you off.' Lieutenant Mera turned and bowed to Ione. "Here's to beauty's finest flower, The maiden of my own birth-land!" Ione arose and acknowledged it, formally, with a,blush and a courtesy. Now was the doctor's turn, and all expected him to say something very smart or very funny.  And so they laugh- ed immoderately, when he gave "Dinah is the gal for me! :' "I should think you were of Southern descent," said Miss Lou." "' O, yes!

Lieutenant Mera acquitted himself in the most faultless manner with Miss Hamilton, and Lieutenant Storme had a wild flirtation with Miss Nora. Once more on the water, they all joined merrily in fun and song. As they neared the shore, they heard the band playing that sweet selection from 4"The poet and peasant." They dipped the oars to listen. Ione was charmed. Shle had never enjoyed such a vision of enchantment. The lull of the water on the little boat; the glimmer of lights on the hill-side; the delicious notes of the band stealing down through the summer air; the grand dark mountains, surrounding them like a curtain of shade, while the moon's bright crescent formed a fitting tiara for the brow of "Cro' nest " -all combined to make a scene of inimitable beauty. The music ceased, the boat was moored, and the weary party ascended the hill, each occu- pied with their own thoughts. They said adieu, at the hotel, and the cool breezes fanned to sleep tired ones, as they stole to their respective couches. "i Right (or left) Oblique. 2.

"Wlhy should she appear in such a false light to him, when a few words might make them friends again?" This dictated her early appearance On the piazza the morning after the excursion to Indian Falls. She hoped to see some one she could walk out to " guard-mounting" with, but there was not one she recognised, and she had fully made up her mind to go alone, when she saw Mrs. Maryglot coming through the hall. "Oh, you good angel! wont you come out to see the cadets with me?" cried Ione rushing at her.

"Any of them will do, dear madam, only hurry, or we shall see none at all!" They were soon surrounded by the handsome young cadets, looking like so many fresh aolls. Ione still did not see Mr. Smith; he was there, but made a complete circuit to avoid her. After a little, Madam, who had felt a-deep interest in him, and saw her pet's eyes roving after him, left her and followed him. ' How are you, my friend? Has your accident destroy- ed your memory, or has absence obliterated the little inter- est you felt in your friends?" "O, no!" he answered, bashfully." "I have not seen you at the hotel; I thought you might at least have come to thank those who did not forget you when you were in the hospital." "O, Madam! am I indebted to your great kindness for those lovely flowers? they were the only bright things I saw, all the time I was there!" "No, no! they did not come from me; but if I chose I could disclose the secret; but after such neglect, I think I will keep my own counsel." "Please, please, Madam! I will show you how grateful I am if you will only tell who I am to thank. Just think how I must appear!" "Guess, then," she replied. "Miss Lizzie Arnold!" he said confidently. "Lizzie Arnold!

She rose, colored deeply, and making a stage-courtesy to Lieutenant Burlyton, ran into the breakfast room. Lieutenants Saberin and Mera took a long breath as they turned from the window, and as they passed the dining-room windows, they looked in and bowed to Ione. "Mera, 1 did not dream she played so finely." "Nor I; she has played for me often, in Mrs. Boba- line's parlor, but only agreeably." "Do you know I think she is a consummate actress, Mera! Antd I am always wondering what she will astonish us withl next." The latter arose, and went to meet AMadam Maryglot, whom he saw on the piazza, to see if he could find out a little more about lone. He had won madam's good opin- ion by his uniformly well-bred deference to her. She liked to talk to him. 4"Madam, where have you hidden yourself this long time?" he asked in a most interesting tone. "O, I have been with Miss Ione to see the cadets, and since then to my breakfast," she replied shortly, for she was so thoroughly a woman of the world that she kllew he was not so anxious to ascertain how she spent her time, as to make it an especial errand to her. "Then you missed the delicious music!" "No, I heard enough of it. I like better to hear her converse." "' Do you know anything of her history?" for once asking a direct question. 6"Yes, her father is dead, and her mother lives in S n Francisco, where they removed from South Carlolina, wlheit she was a little girl; and that is all I ever heard.^ Lieutenant Mera stood turning the signet ring on his fingers    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6558-00000079"/> 158         Tactics; or, "Is that your class ring, Lieutenant Mera?' "No, but a ring that possesses a charm, and yet I am angry whenever I look at it! It was a gift from my moth- er; she gave it to me, as it was all the fortune she had to leave me." "A ring? how curious, tell me more," and she took the ring and examined it closely. "There is nothing to tell. It came from her only brother who was immensely rich, and died in the East In- dies, leaving all his money to strangers, not a sou to his sister or her son." "J. A." read Mrs. Maryglot, 6' what does that stand for?" "For Juan Alcantara,- it is my name too, I was named for this uncle. I have his miniature and this ring." He mused long and then said, "Sometimes I think I would sacrifice every thing for the power that wealth gives! and ny very name seems to remind me of what I have lost." "You can easily marry money! such a fine looking fel- low as you are ought suerly to secure a good market." He answered in a husky voice, "I will never marry a woman that has more than I have, and that would be too little to ask any woman I could love, to live upon. So you see, madam, my fate," Single Blessedness." "O, don't talk in that fearful way! I shall think you a grown up boy; any man can take care of, himself and a wife, if he has health and your income. Wlhy I know many clergymen in my country who live elegantly on less than you have." "Yes, but they live on faith! I have no hope in this world, or that which is to come." "Pray, pray! you talk like a suicide!" He smiled sadly. I'll take your advice, madam." "To what, to kill yourself?" "O no,- to pray!" and he left her, with a pleasant lit- tle nod.

"To march to thefront in double-quick time." lone and Miss Storme came out arm in arm, after din- ner, and a man with half an eye might have seen there was a precious secret on the thpis. "Now Ione, I want you to promise me the last week in August, will you not?" ' Is there anything to transpire of unusual interest." Lou. blushed and she went on. ' Tell me now, or I'll not promise! mamma is wild to have me home before the cold weather." "O, I'll tell you all, I don't know why I should not. I have " and she lowered her voice, and whispered it in Ione's ear, "I have accepted Dr. Oglevie; I think he is an angel of a man! and brother is very fond of him, and when I go home - if papa and mamma are willing - we - will- be married in August! You looked shocked! it is not so very soon; mamma' knew papa only eight weeks! Besides, Dr. O. says he may be ordered off--and then - why we should be all married." lone laughed nervously. "Now I want vou my third bridesmaid; brother and Nora are to serve, and cousin Maria and Lieutenant Mera, and you and Lieutenant Saberin, the very perfection of a party. Is it not funny that it should be the whole Indian Falls party! What if all should be matches! Do tell me, are you affianced to the proud Lieutenant Saberin?" lone turned to whisper to her, and caught a bite of her rosy cheek between her teeth. She screamed and said, "Guilt, guilt!"She made Ione promise to serve.    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6558-00000080"/> 160         Tactics; or, "When do you leave?" said she sadly. "Well, brother ]lopes to get off in three or four days; he cannot go until the Board leaves; those horrid 'planks' as the cadets call them, must be ' fired off,' before any one can move a step.' "And do you know what they call their wives and daughters?" laughed Ione. 4"They call them ' shavings' and ' splinters' and 'slivers.'" Lou. shouted, "O,' that's dreadful; I am glad I'm not a ' sliver.'" The two girls went to their rooms to prepare for the af- ternoon's campaign. Miss Lou. was to go from Fort Put- nam, serenade with Dr. Oglevie, and lone to see "Flirta- tion," through the lens of a cadet's eyes. Mr. Smith would not permit any unpleasant references to be made, that is against cadet principles. He chatted on as if there had been no break in their agreeable acquain- tance; he culled a bunch of wild flowers and tied them with grass, insisting, that she should give him a hlair-pin to arrange them in her llair. A French maid could not have done it better. On their return they inspected Fort Clin- ton, just reconstructed; from the bastion they saw cadets coming out on the plain in their fatigue-jackets. There, was to be fencing and bayonet exercise, and they went over to see it. They found Madams Bobaline and Mary- glot, Lieutenants Mera and Saberin, going through a sim- ilar exercise; tongues for foils. There were peals of laughter from the groups of spectators, at the cadets. All cried well-done, and separated in high glee. Cadet Smith walked around the plain with lone, to the hedge, " cuttingr his tea." She asked him to come up in the evening. He regretted he had not put in a permit, but perhaps, he should not be able to see her if lie came. She said she should always be happy to see him, but now he had lost his tea, would he not let her go and get him some cake. "O, no, I am not late for my tea, and if I am, Everton will save me a piece of bread."   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     161 "A piece of bread! that is too hard! Please do not leave the hedge till I come back, or I'll sit down and cry." She flew up the walk to the dining-room, whispered to Mikey to hand her two or three sandwiches and some cake, in a napkin. Only too glad to execute an order so pleasantly given, Mike was back in a trice, suspecting it was for some favor- ite cadet. lone did not dare to go through the hall, so ran down the north steps, to the-hedge. As she passed the path leading to the flag-staff, she saw an officer coming to the hotel, but did not see who it was. Cadet Smith took the napkin and said it was ' manna in the wilderness,' that she was his ministering spirit, etc. Everton and he would feast. As she entered the hall she saw an officer standing imn the shadow of the door; she could not distinguish him, but light frotn the hall falling on her face, enabled him to see her plainly enougah. She did not like to feel that she was watched, and with an unpleasant sensation around her hleart, she entered the supper-room. Viola -was not there, but lone did not give her many thoughts. They had grown very independent of each other. She sat at her tea some time, thinking of the secret that had been con- fided to her. She rose from the table, and as if led by an invisible hand, made her way through the crowded hall to the north door. The same officer still leaned against the pillar; he had evidently been looking into the dininag- room.  He stepped towards her.   She walked rapidly away and seated herself in an empty arm chair, near a group of ladies and gentlemen, thinking she would be lost sight of by him, and perhaps could see who he was. He soon passed, scanning them closely. Ione saw that he thought her one of the party. He passed a window, the liliht from which showed it was the Colonel. She sat wondering whether it could be she he was in quest of, or was he looking for Viola. He reappeared, and this time peered into the ladies' faces, begging pardon each    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6558-00000081"/> 162         Tactics; or, time, saying he supposed it was his friend. When lie came to lone he stopped. "I have been in search of you ever since parade; have you intentionally evaded me, Miss lone?" "Indeed, Colonel! I have been conscious that some one was on my track, but could not divine who the dark sha- ldow was." "Will you walk?" said he, not noticing what she said about his watching her. She arose and took his offered arm. "Miss lone, I have good news for you. The Board of Visitors are going to give the graduating class a hop to-morrow evening, and I am in doubt whether to accept it. Have you any friend you would like to meet?" She remembered that he saw her come up from the hedge, and replied, "4 O, yes! I have a number of friends I should like to see." "Then I must let them have a hop. To-morrow eve- ning the Board of Visitors will give the first class a hop, nominally, but in fact it will be given to Miss lone by the Colonel. Will you accept it?" "Yes, indeed! anything to give the poor fellows a little pleasure!" "Poor fellows! I wish we poor officers could manage to awaken a little sympathy." "You do not need it, and they do," she said, simply. "What, the wlole corps, or only the poor fellow you were playing milistering angel to a few moments ago? Are not your feet damp? I must inform your aunt of this little clandestine meeting of yours." "4 She will not care. She knows that I am old enough to take care of myself." "' Which I fear Miss lone is not, on West Point. You little know the snares and wiles practised here. Please let me be your protector? I know the young men on West Point pretty well, and canl warn and advise. Please come to me at any time when you are in doubt as to what is right or proper!" lone was overwhelmed with his condescension,- an offi-   Cpid in Shoulder-Straps.         163 cer of his rank to feel any interest in such a friendless young girl! How very kind! She would do as he had requested, and come to him. He found retired seats for them, and recounted little ro- mances of his '" victories and defeats," as he called them, in the art of love. But he was too old now to marry, but not too old to feel an interest in pretty young girls such as she was. She was beguiled into thinking the Colonel very fascina- ting, but frightened when she found it was eleven o'clock. She did not seek Viola, for guilt made a coward of her * she knew   she had no right to be talking to any of Viola's beaux.   The Colonel too had slipped a note into her hand at parting, she laid it on her bureau, and forgot it till just as she was going to sleep. She sprang up and looked at it. It was a bit of poetry.

She crushed it in her hand, and feared him; and dread- ed to see him on the morrow. "To face about in Marchin'g. Ione came into breakfast late, as she had taken a long walk with Cadet Smith, after " guard mounting." Every one she knew had left the table, except Lieutenant Alton. He brought his plate, and asked to sit by her, as he wished to tell her about all the prospective gaiety for the next four days. She greeted him with pleasure. "Tell me what and where!" "To-night the ' Board,' give a dance to the first class here. To-morrow night, there is to be a party at the Su- 1erintendent's; and the evening before we leave, which will be, I hope the next again,. the officers give one at the 6 mess.'" "That is delightful: But what shall we do when you are all gone?" "O, you will have Cadet Smith back, and we expect td6 return in August.  Old Tempest will fugit!" lone laughed at the free translation. Miss lone, will you give me the pleasure of being your escort to-night?" ' I shall be most happy to accept your invitation." "Poor Saberin is looking pale, he feels so foolish to be eclipsed by a second class-man. Which is the accepted, Lieutenant Saberin, or Cadet Smith?" She looked quite indignant, and felt deeply, her position. 'i Why should you speak so, Lieutenant Alton? They are both good friends, I hope," she admired Lieutenant Saberin more than any officer she knew, but felt that " conceal- ment was a sin " in matters of such moment, and yet his avoiding a display of attention, seemed delicate, and was   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     165 in fact a thousand times more charming than the exhibi- tion of an announced engagement. She hastened to join Viola in the parlor, who greeted her haughtily. "Really lone, I shall soon need an introduction! I suppose you have been invited to the hop, this evening?" 4"Yes, Viola; there is to be one to-morrow, and one the next night." "Where, who told you?" "At the Superintendent's, and at the officers' "mess.' Lieutenant Alton just told me." "' I must send to New York for a dress, for the ' mess party,' " she said in a business-like way. "Comeup stairs and help me to select what I shall wear to-night." They ascended to Mrs. Bobaline's parlor. lone threw herself on the lounge, and taking the comb from her hair, it fell in masses of curls over her shoulders ; she glanced in the glass opposite, and thought, " that is be- coming, I'll wear it so to-night." Viola emerged from the bed-room loaded down with green boxes. She opened them and displayed every shade of silk and tarleton, one could imagine. A mazarin blue tarleton festooned with white 'crush-roses,' was decided on. "Now, lone, select your dress and bring it in for me to see." lone picked up '; Pickwick," and started. 'Viola cried after her, "Don't take that book, or I'll not see you again." Slhe promised to return immediately, and sat down on the floor by a large trunk she had only once inspected since she came to West Point - the unhappy evening of Mrs. Colde's party. The crimson silk lay on the top, and she thouglit of the unmanly way in which Lieutenant Saberin had behaved to her that night, - now she was engaged to him! She wondered when she should again array herself in the gay habit. She was more undecided what to choose than Viola, for her dresses almost frightened her with their gayety and elegance,- she dreaded to expose them to jealous eyes. She lifted one, a pink tarleton; it looked like a rosy foam-wreath, 4' This will do; it looks more like    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6558-00000083"/> A166         Tactics; or, what they. wear here,"and she ran in to show it to Viola. She examined it closely, "l Ione this is very lovely, have you any more?" "Yes, mamma has put up evening dresses for a cam- pain!" Madam said, "You must show them to me, I had no idea that you were so fancy, in San Francisco I " "Squad, right about." 2d. March." Ione arrayed herself early; and sat on the bed, reading her text book, "Pickwick," it was a great comfort to her, these days. Mrs. Bobaline sent her maid in for Ione, she snatched her fan, handkerchief, and gloves, and ran, as there was no time to lose, if Viola was ready. As she entered, her aunt exclaimed, ' "How lovely your dress is! and your hair in ringlets, that way; you look only five years old! too much dress for a party given in the house though." She must say something to take the wind out of Ione's sails, and draw a shadow over her face. They descended to the north parlor. Lieutenants Alton and Saberin soon joined them. The latter whispered to Ione, " lWhy have you cut me to-night?" "1 You did not ask me, and Lieutenant Alton did." "6 A glorious redowa, Miss Ione, may I have the pleas- ure?" offering her his arm; Lieutenant Alton- bore her off in triumph. Mrs. Bobaline and Lieutenant Saberin soon followed. Lieutenant Mera and Miss Hamilton stood in the door watching the dancing, -"They are very fine looking, are they not," said he. 4( Who?"I am not a witch, to know who you are thinking of," she said. "The Altons and Saberins!" "Yes, but. they ought to change partners. Lieutenant Alton is too light for Miss Ione, and Mrs. Bobaline is too dark for Lieutenant Saberin."   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     167 "Why, must light and darkness blend? that would make a twilight!" 4"Always! that softens and blends the two,- don't you see?" He looked at her eyes and hair, and said "Please make one exception." She looked at him in a vacant way, and said, "Every one says they are engaged." Lieutenani-t Mera. (Mentally.) "Wasted sweetness, ' Desert air.' " (Aloud.) 4"Miss Hamilton, may I dance the next Lancers with you?" She accepted with a very sweet smile. "' I'll go and see when it will be." He left her and sta- tioned himself near a window, where he could watch un- disturbed, Alton and Sabe rin, and their beautiful part- ners. Mrs. Bobaline rested at each turn of the room; but Ione and Alton whirled on, like tops. When Mrs. Bobaline stopped, Lieutenant Mera stepped up behind her and asked for the next dance. She bowed assent, and they went to promenade in the hall. Lieutenant Alton set off for the piazza with lone, and engaged the next three- dances, just in time to forestall Lieutenant Saberin, who liad come in search of her. "Miss lone, I shall claim the next two dances," said he after the manner of one who had authority. '"Indeed, will you?" said Lieutenant Alton, "She has just given these into my custody!" Lieutenant Saberin looked daggers at the handsome, blue-eyed Alton, who smiled listlessly, and slowly saunter- ed to the dancing room. Lieutenant Saberin said to'him- self, "1 She is a flirt, but she has found her match!" lone regretted what she had done, but it was too late; and she could do nothing but finish her dances in a very distracted way, with Lieutenant Alton. At last her "bonny boys in grey " came to her rescue. Cadet Allen rushed up to claim his dance, and asked her to go out on the piazza, as he had something grand to show her. They %    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6558-00000084"/> 168         Tactics; or, hastened to the north piazza. There he stepped where the licrht from the window fell upon him, and stooping, turned up the bottom of his pantoloons, and shewed her his boots. "1 Real boots, with red kid tops, Miss Ione!" putting his heels together, and rising on his toes, while holding still, on his pantaloons. Ione clapped her hand over her mouth, to save the as- sembled people from an electric shock. Redowa, Gallop, Mazurka, and Waltz, were flown through by Ione and her mad partners, and then came the "March " through the hall, around the piazza, in " double-quick-time." As soon as Lieutenant Alton saw her at liberty, he ex- ecuted one of ' Lord Dundreary's little wuns " to secure her for the Virginia Reel. "Miss lone, I wish you lived round at the gate, or at Castle Cozzens." "' How so?" she asked. "That I might have the very great felicity of escorting you home!" "Ha! a la wish she lived down at ' Buttermilk,' that would be a longer walk," said Lieutenant Burlyton. When the dance commenced, lone found the little Na- poleon at the foot of the dance. As she advanced to meet him in the reel, she said, "You have not spoken to me this evening, Lieutenant Mera. ' "No, Miss lone; you have been so surrounded." When they met again,--  I determined to have one dance with you, so I took this position!" She acknowledged the compliment by a smile, which she saw was noticed bv Lieutenant Saberin. As they left the room, Ione called. Lieutenant Saberin to her, and said tremulously, "Will you take me to the party, to-morrow evening?" "4 Most certainly, Miss Smith!" said he, very stiffly. She felt relieved at the prospect of making all straight again, and said "Good night," in her sweetest tones. She ascended the stairs, "wondering why lovers always made each other unhappy."   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.     169 "TITLE THRD." G SCHOOL OF THE COMPANY." "Lesson First.  To open ranks." The Superintendent's quarters were thronged with the gay and beautiful. Brocades and diamonds; tarleton and pearls; swiss-muslin, and coral; black coats, and white kids; blue coats, scarlet sashes, and epaulettes; grey coats, bell buttons, and chevrons, mingled in one grand mel6e. But of all the assembled, none were more elegant than the guests we shall escort thither. The crowd near the door stood aside to admit Madam Bobaline, Ione, the Colonel, and Lieutenant Saberin. Madam in her full bridal-robes, leaned on the arm of the Colonel, as if she were that moment being led to the altar'; and Ione the perfection of loveliness, in white, her curls caught up with a pearl comb, looked like a timid young brides-maid. They had some difficulty to find the Super- intendent, as the dancing had commenced. Lieutenant Saberin promenaded leisurely up and down the parlors, much to the discomfiture of the dancers, and admiration of those he made to " stand round." Ione, a belle to-night, received attention from every one she knew, except Lieutenant Alton, who seemed to have forgotten that he had ever seen her. It might have been that lie was very much occupied in exercising his ingenuity to keep a young belle, a beautiful dancer, in a window, con- versing on matrimony, as the night was too warm for the young gentleman to feel equal to the exertion of dancing, and lie showed consummate skill in keeping one of the finest dancers in the room, spell-bound at his side. At supper Madam Maryglot chanced to be near Ione. As Lieutenant Saberin left her he asked, "What shall I 8    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6558-00000085"/> 170         Tactics; or, bring you.  A kiss?"  She smiled and said "Yes." "4' Voe victis,' that's Latin," whispered one over her shoul- der, so suddenly it gave her a chill. "I do not understand!'" she retorted back over the same shoulder. "But why blush, ma petite? c'est une affaire flambe." "You did not suppose we were in earnest, madam! you are unmerciful." 4"No I'm not, ' mais ily a dans cette scene beau-coup de pathetique.' " 4" O, madam! what should I say?" 4"You are beautiful to-night, but I suppose you know it. Madam Viola regrets you receive so much attention from l'atout. as you will occasion remark." "Did Viola speak to you of it?" please tell me what she said." "No, no! jealous; that's what she is, You're a little too young and a shade to pretty! Go ahead, and take all the kisses you can get." Lieutenant Saberin returned before Ione could reply, and spoke to madam very pleasantly. "4 This is the first officer, I have had a speak at this eve- ning! I have been dependent on those ' beamns,' as the ca- dets call them, for all my information. One might as well be at Saratoga or any other stupid place, if one is not to see an officer." He laughed and said, 4"Which will you have, madam? I will get the Colonel to detail him for especial duty!" 4"Lieutenant Mera," said she,--' where is Ursa Minor, this evening?" "He is at present among the stars; having given too much attention to the dipper," said he, bitterly. "Wretch," exclaimed. she, "Do you dare to say he is drunk?" Lieutenant Saberin humbly begged pardon, but he only meant to carry out the astronomical figure. ": Look out that you don't have to be carried out your- self!" responded she indignantly.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,     171 As they left the supper-room, Viola, who was leaning 'on the arm of a senator, stopped Ione, and asked her to accompany her to the dressing-room, under cover of ad- justing her apparel, but in reality to get away from her senator, and stand a chance of getting Lieutenant Saber- in, as she knew that lie would wait for them. She was desperate, and determined that lone should not take her particular property away from her any more; and she flid tell her so while poor lone was replacing a pin in Viola's dress that shle had taken out herself.  lone, I am shocked at you, for monopolizing Lieutenant Saberin to such a bare-faced extent; it may flatter him, but he is too much a man of the world not to feel contempt for you; lie knows that after a certain length of time, a young lady's pride and good taste ought to dictate that she should leave him of her own accord! It is not likely he is going to be amused and pleased at being detained at the side of a child. You should be more considerate for me, he has not tlad a moment to speak to me this evening; he is an old frield of mine, and I expect a certain anlount of respect from him in public! the lack of that will cause remark, and your behavior will -brin(g down every tongue on you! Miss Vera Colde was so very impertinent as to open her great eyes on me, and ask who you were, that Lieutenant Saberin danced attendance on you so meekly! So you see! and it is only because he did not wish to attract at- tention to me, in my husband's absence, that he attends you, but I don't intend to give him up to you! ' She had run on in such a frantic way that she did not think how lotidly sihe spoke, nor regard lone's flashing eye, and crim- son cheek. When she finished, Ione said in a low tone, 4 I have a rialght to Lieutenant Saberin's attentions!" and ran past Lieutenant Mera in the hall, down the stairs. If Lieutenant Saberin had not heard one word, her clanged appearance would have told the tale. She looked wondrously beautiful; she was the pearl changed to the flashing diamond.    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6558-00000086"/> 172         Tactics; or, If you have improved madam's appearance as much as she has yours, she should be much obliged to you," said he scornfully. "Lieutenant Saberin, will you grant me one favor?" "I am afraid I cannot, Miss Ione." "How do you know till I tell you? It will make me happy; I think that might make you do it." "Tell it, Ione." "I wish you never to speak to me in my aunt's pres- ence, or show me any more than the coldest civility." "Never speak to you! that would be extraordinary in- civility, I could not be that to any one, certainly not to my sweet-heart, ma petite fianc6e," lee replied, tenderly press- ing the hand that rested on his arm. Ione felt a thrill of pleasure and pride in her veins that was a new sensation to her, she was beloved! She look- ed down on his hand, the diamond glittered there. "What a superb ring!" she observed.  And the thought that perhaps it was an engagement ring for her- self, flashed before her mind, creating an unusual halo there. "That? that a very dear friend put on my finger, when we parted, perhaps -forever," said he, with an awkward attempt at a melancholy tone. "Where have they gone?" asked she innocently, in- terested by the tone of his voice. "They live a long way from here! - and - and I am to return it, if I ever see them again." "Does it belong to two people?" laughed she like a child. "Yes, it belongs to me now, and my friend when we meet," he replied playfully, as if speaking to a child. She raised her eyes to his and looked him fully in tileo face for the first time. He felt that she was reading his heart, with a woman's intuition, and dropped his eyes. "How guilt, onoe harbor'd in the conscious breast, Intimidates the brave, degrades the great!"   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.      173 "6 Come little one! I want the ' old Virginnay never tire,' with you," said Lieutenant Burlyton, rushing up. He took Ione's hand, drew it in his arm and started off with her, making a hideous grimace over his shoulder, in return for the brow-beating Lieutenant Saberin was try- ing to inflict on him. "You are so funny, Lieutenant Burlyton, I always make ready a laugh when I see you coming!" "And you are a beauty, so that just makes it; we two together, are beauty and the beast!  What was that humbug of a Saberin saying, to make you look so amazed? Tell me as you would a father, and I may be able to pro- tect you against the wiles of the adversary, as the Colonel says to all the young girls he wants to interest in him." She looked frightened, "Does he really talk that way to every one?" "Ha, ha! has he been talking so to you, little innocent?" "Yes, and did you know I believed him!" "That's right, my dear, believe everything everybody says to you. "I'll not except Lieutenant Burlyton!"  "' O yes, accept him when he proposes, you could not get a finer fellow!"

She could not define her feelings with regard to Lieutenant Saberin. Slle certainly was sad, but was it for him? It was strangely mixed up with the grief she felt at parting with others. Was it just to him? Did she feel the thrill of anuish she ought to feel at the thought that she miglit never see him again? She was sorry Lieutenant Mera was going, yet he had been more distant and indifferent than any of the officers. She must not think of hiln again, but must look hler pret- tiest for her lover's handsome sake. O, yes! now for her regal robes, her rarest jewels, daintest gloves, and sweet- est smiles.

C"What's that to thee, honey? get up off the floor, you will ruin your dress!" "No, it does not rumple: but oh, my heart aches so!  "c Heart? does it? Have you seen Lieutenant Saberin to-day?" for, despite every other consideration, she loved to see her pet with the finest looking officer on the Post. "No, madam: I don't know but it is that, but parting makes a fool of me. It don't matter who goes." "' Who takes you to the party, to-night?" she asked in a lawyer-like way. "t No one has asked me yet." "Did not he speak of taking you, when you were with him, last night?" "No." "How strange!" "( Nothing is strange on West Point."

"Mrs. Maryglot sat up and looked at her. "What do you mean? you unworldly spirit!" ' O, IP mean, that when mamma was very young she was engaged to a sort of person, he in a pet, because her mother would not let her marry so young, sailed away to Pekin. It was long enough after my inconstant mamma was married, that she heard from him again, and then Jit was to leave all his money to mamma's oldest child. Such a freak! But I never speak of it. I don't know why; every one knows it where I live, and only that Viola kept telling me that I must look to getting myself settled in the world to relieve my dear mamima of me, I should have told her I suppose, but when I found she did not know about it, and I did not care what others thought, I was de- termined not to say a word, but see if some one would not love the poor girl!

Then I should have been Miss Alcantara, instead of Miss Smith." Mrs. Maryglot repeated,   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     1" "What fates impose, that man must needs abide, It boots not to resist both wind and tide!" "Madam I am the victim of circumstances," said Ione in a desponding tone. "In that your name is not Alcantara?" "No; in that my name will be Saberin." "Why don't you wait till you find an Alcaniara?" said madam thoughtfully. 4"I will!!" said lone, starting to her feet with one bound, "4 An Alcantara knows how to love!" "Alcantara?

Shadows fled from her brow like mist before the rising sun! she had untied the heavy load from her shoul- ders, and it had fallen. She had a friend! And the light had penetrated her soul, that she need not marry till she chose to do so. Viola had intoned so many axioms about the positive necessity of any young lady marrying the first man that offered himself, and saying thank you! particularly a poor widow's daughter, that she began to imagine herself in such a case. But after comparing her own independence with that of Madam Maryglot, she be- gan to think herself somebody; but she shrank from the notoriety that an announcement of this would expose her to, and that Lieutenant Saberin would never release her in the world, she threw the card on the bed, and went at Mrs. Maryglot like a highway-woman: "6 Mrs. Maryglot, 1 would give my life, that I had not told you! I beseech you not to divulge it, or I am irretrievably lost! Lieuten- ant Saberin will never give me up, and I would rather be any servant in this house, than be married for my money!"

" The cadets proved to be three of Ione's friends, and the adjutant, her new acquaintance. Cadet Smith invited her to go to the library with him, and soon Mrs. Maryglot joined them, and they hastened to secure seats. The Colonel politely designated a seat to Ione and madam, the young men going to their class. lone was delighted. She had always thought the library grand, but to-day it was bright with decorations, and crowded with happy faces. There was a platform erected, on it sat the digni- fied and honorable of the Post; - General Scott, our sec- ond Washington ; the martial but urbane Superintendent; the Professors, reminding one of the Roman senators; tlhe courtly Colonel ; the Board of Visitors, and the graduating class. The rest of the room was crowded with the offi- cers' families, and distinguished persons from abroad, the other classes of cadets in the gallery. The band, a fine military-looking body of men, could be seen above the beautiful portrait of General Scott, draped with flags. The President of the Board of Visitors addressed the young men about to receive their diplomas, in the words of a father. "A most wise iand touching appeal," madam pronounced it. The superintendent then in a very felici- tous manner, distributed the diplomas they had toiled so long for, and now prized more than untold wealth. The band played the "' Star Spangled Banner." Then follow- ed the greetings - the congralulations! while each cadet's eye, gloawing with proud feeling, seeks his reward in the delight and interest pictured on the fair face, or the pa- rental one he loves best. Alas for those on whose hearts those sacred feelings have to be crushed back! There   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     179 were those there, but not to croak at such a time. They each found the young lady they admired most at that par- ticular time, to place in her hand his diploma. This, the proudest moment the voung soldier ever sees, makes him an Alexander in his own eyes, and in many other dancing pair brighter than a victory, for it is a victory without a regret,- no remorse, no haunting faces of the slain, nor regrets for their heart-broken dear ones! Ione had a diploma to read, and thought Smith looked very imposing on parchment. They two excused them- selves to Mrs. Maryglot, and went to walk, till parade. That last parade! There are moments when one's na- ture resembles the ground prepared for the seed, all soft- ened and touched to tears by a breath of perfume, a note of music, an evening sky, -anything that reminds one of the past, or points to the shadowy future! lone stood entranced, as she heard the sweet notes of "Auld lang syne," great tears filled her eyes. "Home, sweet home!' bursts from that glorious band, and every heart feels the silken cord tightening, the quivering thread that binds to cot or hall. The manly heart beats quicker at the thought of again lifting the latch, and greeting the loved mother and father, brother and sister, after the vears of separation and toil, that makes months seem years- and years to the young cadet, a life-time. As they marched into ("Bar- racks," the band played "I see them on their winding way "  The first class cheered, and threw up their hats, and at breaking of ranks, embraced each other with shouts of j*oy.

She accepted gratefully, right glad to be independent of the tardy, indifferent officers. "O, Miss Ione! your aunt just informed me, that you were quite neglected, not having received an invitation    <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6558-00000090"/> 180         Tactics; or, from any of the officers yet, for the hop to-night. Will you oblige me by joining my party? I have two other ladies under my wing. This was said by the Colonel, all gold lace and plumes, just as the cadet left Ione. She was in- dignant. "Thank you Colonel, I have an escort!" She bowed and ran up the steps. Here she encountered Lieutenant Alton with his very bland smile. "Miss lone, Lieutenant Saberin is not at all well and may not attend the hop this evening, sends his apology by me, may I, hope for the pleasure of taking you?" She replied, "I am very sorry Lieutenant Saberin is ill, and much obliged for your politeness, but I am going with Cadet Smith." "I regret extremely I have been too late in my invita- tion, and hope Lieutenant Saberin may be able to attend, as he is almost indispensable to all of us at our parties," and he smiled slyly at her. As she ascended the stairs, she thought she would stop in Viola's room. She found her under the artistic hands of a new hair-dresser from New York, her head was a chef d'ouvre. Viola said, "The Colonel has asked me to tell you, if he did not see you, that he would be glad to escort you to the hop." "Yes, I saw him, but am engaged." "To whom?" her aunt said quickly. "To Cadet Smith, as perfect a gentleman as I have had the good fortune to meet." "Have you seen Lieutenant Saberin?" "No, no, no!" sang Ione, and left the room, with per- haps an indifference slightly assumed for Viola's benefit, and she was deceived.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.        181 "TO CLOSE RANKS." Tattoo is beating, and the gay groups are gathering to the rooms of the " officers' mess." Brilliant are the gas- lights, brilliant are the jewels, most brilliant are the bright eyes, and inspiring the sweet smiles and sweet sounds, the music echoes through the long rooms, and soon the dainty feet are tripping lightly. Leaning against the window opposite the door, stands an officer, quietly watching the entrance, as if in expectation of an arrival. He looks pale and stern. Who is. he looking for, that handsome  worldling? "Should he not wear a brow of care! That with three hearts to trifle dare?" Is he musing of, one he cannot think of leaving on the morrow, even for a few weeks, without this look of sadness? Or dreams he of a dark-browed beauty with eyes like the glittering gem on his finger, that sparkles amid the dark masses of his hair as he passes his hand through his curls. Could she " cast that shadow from  his brow, and bid her dark-eyed lover be glad awhile?" or is he haunted by an apparition of other days. "Lightened by the softened splendor Of a lovely harvest-moon, And of saint-like eyes so tender, Glowing in the midnight noon, Many a song of wondrous sweetness  Which thy heart can ne'er forget,    X Bearing with their cloud-like fleetness Thy most passionate regret!"

Through the world he'll make his way, With jest, and laugh, and lightsome lay!" On his arm leans a superb woman, in a gold brocade and diamonds, regal in bearing. All eyes beam admiration or envy, as she passes. Lieutenant Burlyton led her for- ward as if he had captured Queen Victoria! A cadet and young girl followed them: he is tall, dark-haired and vig- orous; his physique powerful, his eye keen and penetrating. He leans towards the lady at his side protectingly, as she looks up at him. She evidently deems those broad shoul- ders no mean fortress. She is very beautiful, a flowing robe of black lace, her hair in rich masses of curls, a sin- gle diamond blazing on her fair brow. Yes, indeed, she was very beautiful! Why frowns and stares the officer in the window? Is he jealous of the fine looking cadet? Does he wonder at the loveliness, and uncommon dignity of the young girl? or - or - what. The doctor and the Colonel passed without seeing him. "Which is to be the successful one, Colonel, Saberin or the cadet?" "I don't know," said the Colonel, "I should not object myself!" "No, she would not be a disagreeable patient!" the doctor replied. lone looked well, and looking well she received attention, and though she danced all the time, she had not seen Lieu- tenant Saberin to speak to him. After her entrance he joined Madam Maryglot, and she led him off in search of the Randolph party. Sheplanned as well as he could have done himself, and Miss Celeste had often found him at her side. He was sufficiently in- different to her to really enjoy the society of the sweet, artless girl, and then she was an aristocrat " of the first water."

Did he feel that a net was gradually closing around him? His plan of resigning in Mera's favor might not work; some one might turn up to call him to an account in some of his tacks, and then was he not a little cruel to delude that sweet innocent into the belief that he would marry her? He could not afford to be honorable in the matter, and it was not his fault if every foolish little girl ran after him. In fact it was a quid pro quo, she was under obligation to him for a great deal of polite attention, and if he fluttered around her, it attracted others to her, and would probably be the means of getting her a fine match, and so the sophist pacified his conscience. He really respected Lieutenant Bobaline, and perhaps that noble fellow might object to his niece being one of three dangling on the same hook After all it was only two. He could by no possibility encounter his rural divinity again. If Ione was only rich, she would be a terri- ble rival to Pauline. Now the momentous question rested on which he could give up the easiest, for his own person- al comfort. While these thoughts were flitting through his mind, he was carrying on a lively little "passage of arms," with Miss Randolph, in the refreshment room. Ione was standing on an elevated platform that ran round the billiard room where the refreshment table was laid. Lieutenant Mera and she were entirely oblivious to the keen glances thrown towards them as they conversed so earnestly about the affairs of the nation. His dark eyes said more than words could convey, and she felt her- self culpable to enjoy so much, every moment with him. She saw Lieutenant Saberin was avoiding her, and felt the slight, and determined not to permit him to spoil her pleasure as he had on former occasions, she would be i5    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6558-00000092"/> 184        Tactics; or, grateful for attention from any one. Lieutenant Mera did not seem to weary of her, but remained at her side to dance, to promenade, to entertain her. Few men have power to bind as with a spell; Lieutenant Mera was one of the few. They dreamed on till Mrs. Bobaline came leaning on the arm of Lieutenant Saberin, resplendent in her triumph. He shaded his eyes from the gas with his hand, and gazed anxiously at lone. She was looking pen- sively happy, too dreamily so for his jealous eye not to understand the whole affair at a glance. He spoke as ten- derly as if he had been her caro sposo for twenty years. Good evening Miss Ione, I hope you have enjoyed the evenin  very much, I have had ocular demonstration of the fact."  He advanced to her side, and lowering his voice said, "I have not lost sight of you this evening; and oh, I have been so jealous!" lone grew crimson, and asked, "How is your health, Mr. Saberin? Lieutenant Alton told me you were ill." Not just that; but wishing very much for the open- ing of the millenium; but all this mundane gorgeousness has quite reconciled me to this life as it is." "Come, lone, we must go!"Mrs. Bobaline said impa- tiently. lone stepped to Lieutenant Mera, who had moved out of hearing of Lieutenant Saberin's whispered communication -"Will you be so kind as to take me to Cadet Smith?" They met him looking for lone. Madam Maryglot had captured Lieutenant Burlyton, "to convoy her hame," who was only anxious to do his part of the onerous duties :f society, and get to his loved pillow. Cadet Smith assured lone he enjoyed the walk home more than the en- ;ertainment, and begged she would meet him at guard- nounting to-morrow. Lieutenant Saberin left Mrs. Bobaline in time to meet [one and her friend; lie did not speak, he only lifted his *ap as he passed her, but by the moon-light she could dis- :over a stern unloving look, and her heart sank within ler.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps..     185 "5 Alignments and Mtanual of Arms in Closed Ranks." Ione hardly recognized her cadet friends in citizens' dress, at the breakfast table, and they scarcely seemed to know each other, they were so evidently on their good be- havior. Some in the very last agonies of dandydom, others looking like young quakers, others still, like very well-to- do farmer boys. Released from the thraldom of a hotel 'ta- ble, however, in one respect Richard was himself again, for they all rushed at lone like brothers. "How grand you look in ' citizens, ' cried she. She meant Cadet, or rather now, Lieutenant Smith. They all thanked her, and Lieutenant Smith said "When shall we meet again?" "Please don't make me any sadder, shall we not see you back here?" I will come back if possible, but the lot always falls upon those who would rather go to jail than to return, while those who wish to come are not permitted." The hateful omnibus came rumbling to the door, and amid tears and sad faces of girls left behind them, it swallowed them all like so many Jonahs, and scrambled off. Ione left Mrs. Bobaline conversing with some ladies, and laughed with the real tears in her own eyes, at the dole- ful look on every face,'and wondered if she was such a good illustration of "the girl I left behind me." She went back to the breakfast table and began devouring rolls and chops, to the great amusement of the young waiters, who had already given the unsentimental lady one breakfast. She might have injured the host in a serious manner had not Mrs. Bobaline and Lieutenant Saberin entered. As they passed her he laid a sprig of ever- green at the side of her plate; she took it quietly and arranged it in her hair. Lieutenant Saberin began in a loud voice to tell madam that he was to leave at twelve o'clock. O don't go to-day, the cadets are going into camp."    <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6558-00000093"/> 186         Tactics; or, ': That will be something new and interesting; are there no weightier inducements to offer?"He leaned on the table to look at Ione.

"4 They are indeed, and it would be delightful." 4 I will take good care of you, and bring you back in time for Miss Lou.'s wedding." t If it has come to that," said madam, "4 I shall have to be consulted, as lone has no nearer friend here." "I am nearer, am I not, Miss Ione?" "Yes, one seat," and she colored deeply. Madam saw the blush, and heard the unusual softness of her hero's voice, and sickened with apprehended evil. She rose from the table, where lone sat destroying the bit of roll she could not consume. He leaned over her chair and whispered, "Meet inme at the foot of the steps behind the hotel at eleven o'clock." She shook her head in a very determined way. "' Do, Miss lone, I must see you one moment." She said "No." He whirled on his heel and followed madam. lone trembled violently, and mechanically followed them. He said, "Good morning ladies, I must go and pack. I will return to say good bye, at eleven,)' and lie glanced at Ione. She went and got her hat, and walked rapidly down the path to the Laboratory, on her way to 1"Band-practice," repeating. "O, give me music! my soul is sick, I pant for music! My heart in its thirst is a dying flower! As the bruised and wiltering violet, Its fragrance breathes for the cheering shower, Such shall my heart's deep incense be- Though thirsting yet." She met Lieutenant Mera. t"Where are you going, Miss Ione? I was just going up to say farewell, but may I ac- company you?"   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     187 She accepted his attendance, they climbed half way up the hill, and sat on a large stone, to listen to the music. He told her that he was about to apply to be relieved from West Point. Where would she be? when was she to return home? Ione did not know -would like to go home this morn- ing. "O O no, you must not go now! you are to stand at Miss Storme's wedding. We will have a glorious time there!" said he to cheer her, for she looked sick. It did cheer her, it was a door open from despair. "So we will, and I will try and live for that," she said, with an effort at deceiving him, lest he should think she was miserable on account of the departure of the gradu- ates. He noticed the evergreen in her hair, and asked her for it. "Ah, give it me, and at the wedding you shall see it." She thought of Lieutenant Saberin, and thought too, "He does worse things every day. Does he not devote himself to Miss Randolph and unnumbered others, every day in the cruelest way," and she snatched it from hei hair. Conscience whispered he is a man, and you are a wo-. man, and must be perfect, smile when he condescends to show you attention, not feel resentment when he neglects or treats you with scorn ;- that is being an angel. He watched her closely, as she looked at it in her fin- gers, while these thoughts were running through her dis- tracted little head. He took it from her passive hands, and put it in the button-hole of his vest. "' There you have worn that in your hair, and it is a precious relic."' She smiled sadly, and they walked to the hotel in silence. Mrs. Marzyglot was in the parlor. 1"Madam, I am come to say good-bye!" said he in a very measured way. i; I regret to leave; you have been very kind, and I have not always deserved it." She extended her hand to him, for she really liked him more than any of the officers, in as much as he had inter- ested her in his future.

She stood in the window and watched him as he walked rapid- ly across the plain. Mrs. Maryglot left the room, and still she stood buried in thought. She felt the presence of some one, and turning her head saw Lieutenant Saberin standing by the table. "Ah, Miss Ione, I hope I have not disturbed any pleas- ing dream. I have been waiting an age, for you to speak to me. It flashed on her mind that he had seen her looking after Lieutenant Mera. "You should have spoken to me, I was in a reverie," she said modestly. Of what were you thinking, Ione; was the little Lieu- tenant carrying your thoughts captive to-day as well as last night? "Yes, I was thinking of Lieutenant Mera, he has just bid me farewell," she replied, with a little defiance in the tone. "After I am gone will you be as unconscious of the presence of others, as you were just now, of mine?" "I presume so, it makes a fool of me to part with any- one, yet I think you could easily have arrested my atten- tior, if you had made any noise."

Never mind, lady fair, you have had your revenge  you have the triumph all to yourself." "Let by-gones be by-gones," she answered playfully. Madam Maryglot entered accompanied by Miss Ran- dolph, to all appearance as unconscious as a child that she was interrupting a tete-a-tete. He frowned very becomingly, as if in deep sorrow. I fear I shall not see all my friends to say good bye." Ione rang the bell, and sent for Mrs. Bobaline, who re- quested him to come to her parlor; he asked lone to go with him. She went to the door but refused to go in.. He took her hand and put his class-ring on it, and kissed it saying, "This, one, is dearer than anything I possess, it is sacred!" "Then please do not give it me, I fear I may lose it. It is too heavy for my finger. Mrs. Bobaline hearing voices outside her door, opened it; Ione blushed and went to her room, and the Lieutenant entered Mrs. Bobaline's. "ESSON SECOND. ' "'To Load in Four Times and at Will."

The newly appointed cadets, designated from the older, or more advanced ones, by the name of "Plebes," were runnillg in every direction across the plain, carrying brooms, pails, looking-glasses etc., and wheeling wheel-barrows, with all sorts of somnethings in them. At length the cavalcaide moved forward -a very imposing sight, the band in fill force, the glittering swords and bayonets, the array of young princes in their handsome, showy uniforms, and their " soldierly bearing; the dragoons on their fiery steeds, "' champing their reins," and prancing about to the great terror of the hundreds of ladies lining the roads, paths, side-walks and steps to the different edifices, with every hue and shade of costly array. The locale is alto- gether unsurpassed, "As those who have been there, know, And those who have not, had better go," and see it for themselves, as it will repay them for a short journey. The plain, surrounded by an amphitheatre of nature's " mountain fastnesses and retreats," the lovely homes and massive structures at their base, the grand old trees, and tempting paths beneath; the glorious Hutdson, rejoicing in its beauty and strength, flowin(r proudly to the sea, toying with its chatelaine of tiny ships, and emerald islets. The beautiful town of Newhurg in the distance, with its soft vail of haze floating between the sunset sky and the glowing mirror beneath, like a city in a dream ; the charming residences dotting the mounltains sides, and fill- ing the breasts of the denizens of cities with envy - ah, 'tis an Eden! But a grand march from  the Band of bands brings us into line, and the hundreds follow to the camp- ground.  The floors of the tents are laid the canvas lies   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     191 beside them, preparatory to an attack from the "Plebes " initiated for the .first time into the occupation of tent- makers, and now it becomes "' confusion doubly confound- ed," but soon one white tent after another rises, till all stand in beauty and order. The spectators wonder where that small army has disappeared to, " surely not into those tiny tents!"A very unmusical, but welcome sound booms over the plain, and the hungry multitude take theiir way to the hotel. Omnibus after omnibus, with their sad, or eager crowds, are running away like unrelenting time, after the boats and cars, while those that remain, look into each oth- er's faces, as if each expected he would soon be left alone to tell the tale. "2. To fire by company." This lull was just what lone needed to collect her flushed senses; she walked, and talked to Cadet Allen, listened to the music, attended guard-mounting and parade, and mu- sic in the evenings, until the fourth of July; then the re- lentless omnibus seemed determined to make amends for their former cruelty, and came from every boat and train, with what a New Yorker would consider a pretty fair number inside and out. Lieutenant Smith returned and begged Ione to permit him to see that she lost none of the pleasures of the sea- son, and to begin by allowing him to accompany her to the hop, on the evening of the fourth. This was a very brilliant affair, and the beaux and belles of a few weeks ago were no more missed than if they had never been, ex- cept in a few hearts. At drum beat, such a rush for the dressing room, one who has never witnessed the perform- ance could scarcely imagine, and all found themselves on the plain in an incredibly short space of timel4where wheels and Roman candles, and the rocket's red glare, were already making the heavens bright with the meteoric show- er, while patriotic sentences and devices, written in letters of flame, added to the grandeur and brilliancy of the    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6558-00000096"/> 192         Tactics; or, scene. Through all, and above all, rose the music of the band playing national airs, that fired the breast with patriotism. lone had fallen into the hands of a clergyman, to whom Miss Randolph had introduced her. He offered her his arm to go out on the plain. As he w as a gray-haired man, she dared not refuse; and Lieu- tenant Smith followed, making warlike demonstrations at the head of the old gentleman, whenever he could catch Ione's:;eye. Every rocket that went up he followed with his spectacles, but when he expected the returns, he seized lone by the'hand and ran for dear life, dragging her inva- riably directly toward the falling baton, intending however to keep from under it, and supposing he was going in just the opposite direction. Lieutenant Smith kept near her, endeavoring to gain pos- session, but this only'aroused her new friend's ire. "You will have to come to me one of these days, to take care of her for you when you go to fight the In- dians, and I am not going to give her up to you." "I shall have to shoot you!" replied the fierce young soldier, in a laughing way. "Shoot! I am bullet proof, and could not die in a bet- ter cause." "Bullet proof, ha! ha!" shouted the youth, trespass- ing a little on the good man's indulgence. His Reverence eyed him from head to foot, and in a fine histrionic style addressed him. "Hence Horrible villian! or I'll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me; I'll unchain thy head; Thou shalt be whipped with wire, and stewed in brine, Smarting in lingering pickle." Smith clapped his hands in delight, and lone joined him. At length the inevitable drum beat, and all wound their way to the hotel. lone was getting to be herself again. Viola had no one to persecute her about, and was quite agreeable, with the exception of being " out of all   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     193 patience with lone for letting Lieutenant Mera slip through her fingers that way." "Miss Storme had done well for herself, took the first offer she had." Poor Ione looked at the noble class-ring, but that was a heavy link between two hearts that did not beat in unison. 3. To Fire by File." Ione, here is a letter for you from Miss Storme!" said Mrs. Bobaline entering Ione's room. She took the letter and Viola sat down to hear her read it. "STORME TOWER, --- Dearest lone: I write to tell you to be ready to come to me in two or three days at farthest. My brother Harry will come down for you. He says "Tell Miss lone that I will stop one night and take her to the hop, if she will look at an officer in citizen's dress, on West Point," Maria is here and sends love. Your friend, "Ou. STORME. "How charming that will be!"Ione exclaimed. c' Vi- ola I do wish you could go, and not be left here alone!" O, I shall be at the wedding, and that is all I care for." lone was like a bird in her joyful mood, while prepar- ing for her trip. It was a perfect dream of delight to her. Shortly after, as she was sitting on the piazza with Madam Maryglot, the omnibus drove to the door, and Lieutenant Storme sprang out. Seeing lone he ran up the steps and greeted her warmly. ' Well, Miss lone, all ready?" Yes, for the hop to night? He sat down in his own natural way, told her all the lit- tle interesting et cetera going on at home. He had just returned from visiting Miss Nora Kearney, with whom he was more deeply in love than ever.

"4. To Fire by Rank." The fine steamer bound up the Hudson, landed at West Point the next day, the passengers gathering in a black mass, to look at the fine buildings, and stare at those com- ing on board. "That handsome officer, papa! Is he a general?" "Yes, I think he is!" "O, no! he is one of the cadets. They say they are terrible fellows among the girls!" This was a conversation overheard by lone and Lieutenant Storme; the general was a dragoon senti- nel, at the ferry house. As they neared the pier, a few miles up the river, among the crowd lone discovered Lou. and her young brother, awaiting their arrival. When they went on shore she found two arms were around her neck, and Lou.'s musical voice reiterating, "I'm so glad to see you! This is my brother Johnny, lone." The brother Johnny was dark-eyed, broad-shouldered, and finely moulded, with a face browned by exposure. His pianners were elegant, with an air of well-bred mod- esty, charming in a young man of twenty-two. He shook hands with lone, and his hands were hard and brown as ally farmer's, he boasting himself captain of a yacht. lone was hurried from the crowd into an elegant carriage, drawn by two superb chestnut horses. Young John mounted the box, handling the rains like Plato's "t Grecian youth." ^:A delightful drive along the river-bank for sev- eral miles, with desirable homes on every side, brought them to a gate, with a bird-cage of a lodge beside it. Johnny shouted "Gate!" and a curly-headed urchin ran out' all smiles, to open it for them. A serpentine iarriage road on tihe margin of the river, gave her a fine view of the expanse of lawn, and of the home-like man-   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.     195 sions, with its verandas and pillars draped with roses and honey-suckles, the arm-chairs so temptingly arranged, the fine glass adjusted to look at the vessels on the river, the pretty fountain, with its murmuring music, made a fairy land to lone. Maria Hamilton was reading on the piazza, and ran down to meet them. Mrs. Storme came too, and greeted the new arrival like a mother. She was not disappointed in anticipating a pleasant visit. The days flew like moments. Johnny took her to sail every day, or to gallop over the fine roads, or out in his little trotting-wagon, and even the day the wedding party arrived, found lone and John up the river the entire morning. As she came up from the beach on her return, all drenched with waves they had shipped, Maria met her on the steps, and said, " lone, you naughty girl! go right to your room and dress. Lieutenant Saberin and Lieu- tenant Mera, and the Doctor have come, and Nora Kear- ney is up stairs waiting to see you; hurry, or you will not be ready for dinner." lone rushed up stairs, arrayed herself in her favorite blue silk, in "double-quick time," and entered the parlor after every one had assembled. Lieutenant Storme offer- ed his arm and introduced her to the guests as the second mate of the fast-sailing yacht, "Speed." John did not happen to be present or perhaps the joke would not have been so vociferously received. There were many warm greetings, and each made his way to take the distinguished tar " by the hand. Ere long, Lieuteuant Saberin .was ensconced in a cosy window, behind the curtains, whispering sweet things to lone. The Doctor and Lou. had betaken themselves to one piazza, Miss Hamilton and Lieutenant Mera to the other, and Harry Storme and Miss Nora were walking around the empty conservatory, as if it had been the lost site of Eden they had just discovered. Robert was sent in search of the young people, and being an expert in this sort of thing, he soon brought them in. They bore Doctor Storme's merciless jokes in a very shamefaced O J    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6558-00000098"/> 196         Tactics; or, way. At dinner there was a good deal of "by-play," among the young people, and the health of the Doctor and Lou. was drank by each one calling out to pledge them in his turn, as if he had been the first to propose it. After dinner they adjourned to the grounds. John offered Lieutenant Saberin the use of his fast horse and buggy for a drive, which he accepted, and invited Ione to accompany him; they whirled down the road, amid cries of caution not to run away, and not to disable them- selves for their onerous duties for the morrow. Lieuten- ant Saberin was perfectly lovely, admired the scenery, asked what she had been doing at West Point, and said '"What would I not give if we were in the Dr's. and Miss Lou's place to-morrow ; but oh, that dream of happiness may not be fulfilled in long years." Ione did not look as desparing as he anticipated. If he had been sure that lone had such a home as Miss Storme, would he have postponed his dream of happiness so long? On their return they found Lieutenant Mera entertaining Mrs. and Dr. Storme, Maria and John.   Lieutenant Saberin went wild over their country, its roads, its fences, --in short, everything. Robert came to say tea would be served, and the lovers came from caves and grottoes, and condescended to sip a little nectar, and take a dainty bit of cake. Lieutenant Mera and Mr. John suddenly disappeared, and the moon having risen, not to mention a fine breeze, the "perfect brick," as Lieutenant Mera called him, proposed a sail. "Who slhall I take?" asked Lieutenant Mera. ' If I were to choose, I should say Miss Ione. She is not afraid of anything." "But she belongs to Lieutenant Saberin." ' I guess not, soul and body!" said John, confidently. , I'll manage that." And he did manage. He walked into the parlor, and stood in front of the window, until he attracted lone's at- tention, and then left the room. She knew well enough who he wanted, and in a few moments went after him.   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     197 4"Would you like to take a sail by moonlight?" said he, as she went up to him. "O, yes indeed! But what will they all say?" "I don't know," replied he laughing, "But Lieutenant Mera wishes to go, and I proposed you; he understands boating, so I will stay, and no one will miss you but Lieu- tenant Saberin!" added he slily. Ione said, "' Hush," and turning, saw Lieutenant Mera buried in an immense arm-chair. He rose and said, "Will you go?" lone nodded smilingly in reply, and ran down the steps. Mr. John  suggested the propriety of not shipping many waves in that blue silk. They sailed down the river, tacking from side to side, now in the deep shade of high rocks, then running in a sunny little cove, next out in the bright moon-light, as if they were sailing in liquid silver. "Night on the waves, and the moon is on high Hung like a gem on the brow of the sky- Treading its depths, in the power of her might, And turning the clouds, as they pass her, to light." Lieutenant Mera told her one or two incidents connect- ed with his own history, commencing with commenting on the family they were visiting, and the happiness Dr. Storme must feel in his old age, to have a home of elegance for his children, with no anxiety to shorten his days. "I shall never know that pleasure--my father an officer, was killed in Florida when I was an infant, leaving my mother, a beautiful, gay young woman, an independence. She went to Paris and mingled ill the beau-monde, but her slight for- tune soon melted away, and she married a French gentle- man and returned to New Orleans, where he owned an im- mense estate. I was sent to my father's brother, when I was four years of age, and have never seen my mother since. She had a brother in the East Indies, that was very fond of me as a baby, who she thought would leave me his fortune; but a number of years ago I heard of his    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6558-00000099"/> 198         Tactics; or, death, and that he had left it to some one there. However, I shall never dispute it,-but carve my way to fortune with my sword, and be wedded to my profession. I enjoy ladies' society as a gleam of sunshine, which may not linger writh me.  Being more tlian usually interested considering our short acquaintance, and as I would wish an honorable man to do by my sister, I speak to you now. I have told you this about myself to show you that I am not selfish in what I am going to say; though I am speaking of a friend, I hope I am speaking to one. You are, or may be, inter- ested in Lieutenant Saberin, if you hlave any dear friend in whom you can place implicit trust, on whose judgment you can rely, tell him or her everything, lay open your heart to him, and all that Lieutenant Saberin says and does, and be guided by that friend, if you know such an one; there can be no harm in that. I should not suggest Mrs. Bobaline, as she is young and inexperienced, I - wish your uncle were with you, he is a noble man." Ione did not speak till he had finished, she then said, "I thank you a thousand times, Lieutenant Mera, and shall take your advice. Do you approve of Madam Maryglot?" He answered "Yes, in her truth, but her judgment I know nothing of. She has never known a mother's anxiety, and may not decide so nicely, but you will know Miss lone."  She saw they were running past the bay that they should enter, and spoke quickly, "In here!" He turned the boat in short, the lower side struck a rock, the wind blowing strongly-at the time, she immediate- ly capsized. Ione rose and clung to the boat, but soon lost her hold, and fell into the water. Lieutenant Mera plunged after her, as she disappeared in the shadow of a great rock, but he missed her; she rose again, he clasped his fingers in her hair, and drawing her up, put one stronr arim aroulnd her, and :swam to the beach; when reached he found her almost lifeless. Seizing her in his arms he set off for the -ouse. John was watching for them, and as they came in sight   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     199 he ran forward with an undefinable dread. Seeing the almost lifeless form of lone he snatched her in his arms, and carrying her to his sister's room, called his mother. In a few moments the whole household knew what had happened. Lieutenant Mera went to his room to change his clothes, but soon returned to answer the thousand and one ques- tions always asked on such occasions. When Lieutenant Saberin bid him good-night, he said, I hope you will not suffer from it, Mera, but you came near losing my wife!" Lieutenant Mera looked ghastly, and replied, "You could not have lost more. Thank God, she is safe!" There was very little sleep in the house that night. Poor Mr. Mera walked the floor all night, scarcely knowing which he felt worst about, Ione's engagement, or the duck- ing he had given her.    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6558-00000100"/> 200         Tactics: or, LESSON THIRD." "1st. To March in line of Battle." The day was perfect as all wedding-days should be. Ione arose looking very pale and interesting, but not in- jured in the least by the dive she made to the caves of the Naiads. Lieutenant Mera looked worse than she did, as promenading all night with a mind ill at ease, is not likely to tinge the cheek with vermilion. Many times during the morning, when he looked at lone, he almost wished they had never risen from the waves, but had slept peace- fully there-until the last day; while she avoided or looked shyly at him. The wedding party had assembled in the upper halls and piazzas, and the train from down the river having brought crowds of guests, the grounds and parlors were filled with cheerful friends. Twelve o'clock arrived. All are assembled. Lieutenant Saberin and lone descended first; Miss Hamilton and Lieutenant Mera; Miss Nora Kearney and Lieutenant Storme; then the bride and groom. The Doctor, radiant with happiness, seemed to say, "She is mine own! And I as rich in having such a jewel, As twenty seas, if all their sands were pearl, The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold." The bridesmaids represented all the colors of the National flag-Nora in red, Maria in white, and Ione in blue. The officers in full uniform. The greetings of Louisa's father and mother and broth- ers over, joy took the reins. The family well knew she \ would not have to brave any of the hardships of army hfe, but the thought was touching, that she might be sta-   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.    201 tioned where she would have no gas; hence their sadness, That over, joy took the reins, as I said before. At five o'clock, the bridal party and guests took the trains, the former to spend the night at West Point, and attend the twenty-eighth ball. "2. To halt the company marching in line of battle, and to align it." The crowd at Roe's hotel, were "fast and furious," but the host " polite with candor, elegant with ease," seemed a wizard in accommodating his dear five hundred. The mats and blankets were laid in parlor and hall, while the "citizen-kings," were grateful for a peg to hang their crowns upon. The wedding-party arrived. Lieutenant Saberin immediately consulted the pages of what seemed to him the " book of fate," lo, there in very legible characters, stood, "Lieutenant Ambert, and lady, Miss De Save, New Orleans." He sent his card to their room, grasped Lieutenant Alton by the arm and said, "Let me introduce you to a dear friend of mine, rich and beautiful! I have one lady too many to attend to, to-night; will you be so very kind as to take her to the hop if you are disengaged? "Certainly, I am always disengaged when there is an heiress to escort!" Mrs. Ambert and Pauline came down. Lieutenant Saberin said he was wild with delight at  their coming, introduced Lieutenant Alton, asked after his friend Ambert. He had gone to Lieutenant Burlyton's tent, he would go and find him. He left Alton and Pau- line in a lively conversation, and " with contending emo- tions." Lieutenant Alton invited her to attend the hop with him. She said she could not accept, as Lieutenant Saberin had invited her, last spring. "Ah!" said he, "I may be able to persuade him'to re- 9*    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6558-00000101"/> 202        Tactics; or, sign in my favor, may I make the audacious attempt? He hlas just returned with a wedding party and has a bride's- mnid to take care of." "In such a case, I will accept your invitation now." Lieutenant Alton bowed and left the parlor, to report to lhis friend. "' But Saberin, I should think you would rather give up Miss Smith! Miss De Saye is queenly." She is! but I cannot break up the wedding-party; it is only the matter of walking over and back." '"The deuce, I imagine you will find it more of a mat- ter than that, if I take her!" and he walked off highly in- dignant. "3. Oblique march in line of battle." The thousands of vards of tarleton, tulle, and organdy, crowded into the hotel hall at eight o'clock, would have astonished Stewart or Lord &amp; Taylor. As one puff after another descended and was carried off on the arm of cadet or officer, another came to fill the place. The wedding party stood waiting in the hall, when Lieutenant Alton and Pauline swept by. "' Who the dick- ins has Alton got?" said Lieutenant Storme, '&amp; O, ye gods. but is'nt she superb?"Nora trembled in her silk stockings, and lone glanced as indifferently at her, as one lies down, when he hears the sounding of the fire-bells, and finds his own walls cold. -c Assemble on the Battalion." 80 --- J Andante.

She wore a white satin dress, entirely covered with a golden tissue, the dark waves of her hair were wound with chains of gold, and lay in rich coils round her graceful head. Lieutenant Alton thought her "4 superb," and said to lui-meme, " every man must paddle his own canoe," he pointed out the " young bride's-maid in blue as Lieuten- ant Saberin's bride elect." She was shocked, but chose not to believe it. He asked if she was going to Washington. Yes, Mrs. Ambert had promised some friends there, that she should return before going south." He asked to be permitted to join their company as he was just going on there. She was very glad, as it would be agreeable to have a larger party. Lieutenant Alton was quite captivated, trembled, fear- ing Saberin would come and claim her. Presently Lieutenant Mera came to his side, and signi- fied a wish to be introduced to Miss De Saye. Lieutenant Alton presented him with a grand flourish, as "' Lieutenant Mera of the United States army." Mera crimsoned, and invited her to dance. She accept- ed, and as he bore her off in triumph, his friend whispered 4' Bring her back to me." He smiled an assent, but as soon as the dance was ended, invited her to promenade. New Orleans was discussed, as she boasted that magnificent city as her home. "I think Mrs. Ambert called you Pauline, when speak- ing to you in the dance?" said Lieutenant Mera. "Yes, that is my name." "Pauline De Saye!" repeated he. "That was my mother's name too," said Pauline. ( I am all French. I was born in Paris, and all my father's family live there!"  "And your mother's family, do they live in New Or- leans?" asked he.    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6558-00000102"/> 204         Tactics; or,            i O, no. She was a South Carolinian. She had bnut one brother,-all her family are dead," she replied. "Was she the widow of an officer who was killed in Florida, before she married your father?" "Yes, she was wedded to her first husband but one year when he was killed." A chill crept over Lieutenant Mera as she finished the sentence. Just then Mr. Alton came to take her for a dance. Mera went to Lieutenant Ambert. "Who is the young lady attached to your party?"  "Miss De Saye? She is one of the richest girls in New Orleans. But you may keep your heart closely but- toned in, as she is engaged to a mutual friend of ours!" he answered laughing. "To whom, Alton?"  "No, indeed! yet not to his superior, I must confess; but one the ladies all admire more." "You cannot mean Lieutenant Saberin?" said le, turning pale.                      i "Why not? I do mean Mr. Ulm Saberin," he replied, with a shrewd smile, as if he saw the demons jealousy and doubt, peeping through Mera's inquiries. "Do you know    this?" asked Mera, measuring his words as if they were so many yards of his heart-strings. "Yes, sir, I know it' " he rejoined haughtily. "Villain!" was all that Anmbert caught, through the savage growl, as Mera rushed from the hall. Ambert became uneasy, not knowing what to fear. He sought his wife, but she was dancing with the Colonel, and Pauline looked so happy with Alton, that he gave her no more thought. Lieutenant Mera sought to cool his throbbing brow in the night air, but was unable to stop away from a scene of so much interest to him. Returning, he met Alton and Miss De Saye coming out on the balconv.  He had been meditating challenging " the miscreant," as he de- nominated his most loved class-mate. He thought with tears "( I will not sleep till I have killed poor Saberin."   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     205 Lieutenant Alton stopped him saying, "Mera, Miss De Saye did not hear your name when introduced, and im- agines she has knownsyou before. Lieutenant Mera bowed and begged to converse a few moments with the lady. As soon as they were alone, he asked her to take a seat on the guard-stone. She began, "Lieutenant Mera, I am persuaded you are a relative of mine, my mother was a widow Mera, before she married my father." "Indeed! then I am happy to say there is no doubt of it." He buried his face in his hands, and "Eyes that mocked at tears before, With bitter drops were running o'er." Pauline sat looking at him, afraid to speak. Visions of his infancy were floating before him. A child-mother, with starry eyes, looking love into his baby face. His soul sickened and he nearly swooned, with terrible and contend- ing emotions. The faces of Ione ; his mother; of the now hated Saberin ; of his new fonnd sister 5 danced before his reeling brain. The cool night winds restored him. He essayed to speak, but was afraid the very tones of his voice would terrify the excited girl. He rose, saying as quietly as possible, yet as one would imagine Joseph to have spok- en when he said, "The old man,- is he yet alive?" - "Your mother - is she living?" The light from the door fell on her face, she gave him a woman's glance, her eyes softened; - My mother? I hope so. What should I do, if she were not? Is your mother living?" she asked tenderly. He drew her hand in his arm,.without replying. She exclaimed, "There is something you will not tell me - are you ill?" "Have you never heard your mother speak of a little boy she left, when she went to France?" he enquired in a low, melancholy tone. "O yes I she often, often speaks of her baby boy, and weeps bitterly. He died before I was born."    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6558-00000103"/> 206         Tactics; or, "He did not die, would to God he had!" he said, un able to control himself. She grasped his arm, unconscious of what she was doing. "Do you know him? where, Oh, where is he?" "Would you care to know him?" he asked proudly. "Care to know him? How can you speak so! I have always longed for a brother; the pure light of a sister's love has ever burned before the altar where my little brother is enshrined in my heart!" She trembled with emotion. Lieutenant Mera was softened. "Pauline, you have found a brother, when perhaps you needed one most. I am your brother." They walked to the edge of the balcony, and clasping each other's hands, wept in silence. Pauline, Lieutenant Ambert tells me you are betrothed to Lieuten- ant Saberin," said he with a sorrowful voice. "Yes," she answered " with the proviso that mamma likes him." "My darling, you have fallen into the hands of an un- principled man! The lady he has in his care to-night, is also his betrothed." "Lieutenant Alton told me so, but I could not believe it. Do you know it to be true?" she spoke in a very humble tone. "He told me so this week himself," he replied and she heard the words choking him, as if he were dying, and became greatly alarmed. She was brought up in a city where duels were every day affairs. She clung to his arm, and murmured '"What shall I do? "Leave him to me;" he said sternly. She burst into tears. "Pauline, do you love him?" "O, no indeed! I only fear to lose you now." Lieutenant Mera plead with her to control herself, if she valued his life, while she plead that he would leave Sa- berin to her to punish him. After reflecting and much persuasion, he consented. She was so happy now, that she thanked God for her es- cape and for the protection He had raised up. Lit- tle thought the gay butterflies about them, of the tender    Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     207 scene passing so near them. There was a charm to the ro- mantic girl in the thought of having a brother in disguise in this handsome young officer, which greatly soothed the sting that the infidelity of her lover had inflicted; while Lieutenant Mera could scarcely deny himself the. proud gratification of standing forth before the multitude, an acknowledged brother to this beautiful girl. One con- sideration held him like bands of steel, -tlhe humbling thought, that his young mother had deserted him when a little helpless child, and eloped with a young foreigner of a distinguished family. She had no property, but thought a rich bachelor brother and her widow mother, would take care of her child. She suspended her brother's likeness, and a remarkable ring he had sent her from India, on a gold chain around his neck for toys, these he still had. Her mother dying and giving her child to his father's rel- atives, a proud austere family of Spanish descent, she never returned to her native state. He had just begun to re- hearse the incidents of his life to Pauline, when they were interrupted by Lieutenant Alton, who keeping his eye on Saberin, saw him at liberty and loooking for Pauline, and came to secure her. Entering the hall they met him. "Miss De Saye, I have come to say that I have at last succeeded in disengaging myself from my bride's-maid, will you honor me with this dance?" Lieutenant Mera stalked past him, and ground his teeth. Pauline's eyes glittered, as she said, "Possible! have you succeeded in entirely disengaging 'yourself from her? You have attained great skill in that art, and accomplish those things in double quick time here! Saberin glanced at Alton, but that gentleman not no- ticing him, said, "You know, Miss De Saye, that is an important part of our education here, to make quick matches." "Yes, I've been told, 'You saucy Huzzars Only care for love-letters to light your cigars; And 'tis said -I must tell you - 'tis such a good joke, That with soldiers, engagements end always in smoke!'    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6558-00000104"/> 208          Tactics; or, replied she, with a toss of her queenly head and a scorn- ful laugh. "Miss Pauline, you wont refuse me one dance this eve- ning?" plead Lieutenant Saberin. "Most unfortunately my list is full." "But I must see you, if only a moment to explain." "O, I assure you the case will admit of no explanation," said she haughtily. Lieutenant Alton moved on with her, and Saberin reached the dancing room just in time to see Lieutenant Mera and Ione set off in a frantic redowa. "4. To mark time, to march in double-quick time, and the back step." Were you ever at a cadet hop? No? Then don't talk of your grand parties, of your balls, sociables, stiffa- bles and quadrilliones!

There are no solemn quadrille-marches without a word to say for one's-self, but in the appropriate and poetical words of 16 A SURVIVER.

When Lieutenant Saberin arose the next morning, the first thing his eyes alighted on was the following delicate little billet. "Lieutenant Saberin: - Hearing from my brother, of vour en- gagement to another, it gives me great pleasure to say you are most cheerfully released from your engagement to me. With sentiments, &amp;c. PAULINE DE SAYE." He read the note,--    a carte blanche for those who are adepts in these matters to fill at their leisure.

"Send her her ring," said Pride, and he followed her advice. At breakfast Miss Randolph came and told Ione that her father, who had   arrived late the night before, was going to take her to Professor Weir's studio.   'Would she accompany them at eleven o'clock? Ione accepted with delight. Mr. Randolph was a true type of a Virginian gentle- man of the Washington school, and charmed them       with stories of his travels. He was disappointed at not finding his friend at home, but his son    received them.    They stood before the "Veiled Nun," in silent rapture; the white haired man was dumb before the inspiration of Gen- ius, and felt himself in the presence of a divinity. He begged permission of the young artist to read a piece of poetry he had found while in Europe, years ago.      It was taken from  a number of Blackwood.     He would like to read it to the young ladies in this room. He stood where the light fell on his silver locks, and read to the beautiful group, AN ARTIST'S STUDIO. FROM ]BLACKWOOD OF JAN. 1851. "' I well remember how the light, the pale, pure north light, fell On all within that lofty room, and clothed with mystic spell A massive oaken cabinet, and many a curious chair - Bright armor of the olden time, and relics quaint and rare. "I marked them well,-- the gathered books, the painter's treasures all: Here was the resting place of day, whatever might befall ; The inner shrine of one whose brow the stamp of genius bore, And who the laurels of his fame with childlike meekness wore. "I touched his easel and his brush ; I saw his colors laid- Those simple implements of art, they made me half afraid; For with such trifling means alone, to bid their visions glow, APELLES, ZEUXIS, RAPHAEL, wrought wonders long agro!

"( The breeze that through the window came, to fan his lifted b rw, Fold of sweet perfumes all abroad, of blossoms on each bough He heeded not its fluttering, nor listened to its sigh, As sadly it stole back again, along the wave to die. "He recked not that the golden eve on old Fort PUTNAM glowed, Or that the tiwlight in the vale enveloped his abode ; Or that the river glided by, majestic, calm and free, While on its bosom snowy sails were flowing tranquilly. For bright unto his soul there came, while wrapped in revery, A noble theme of other days, and lands beyond the sea ; Of men who strove in vain to break the stern oppressor's rod, And boldly sought in other climes the right to worship GOD!

"LESSON SIXTH." 3. To march in column, in route, and to execute the movements thereto." As our little party left the studio, the young artist ac- companied them to see the tents struck. He told them it was a beautiful sight, the tents falling in an instant. The crowds were hastening to the spot, regardless of the burning rays of the sun.    The band was in attendance, and the cadets were swinging their mallets about their heads like so many young Vulcans, dealing blows on the tent- pins. On the ground Lieutenant Mera introduced Miss De Saye, whom he had brought with him, to lone and her party. She asked many questions about West Point. She said, t"Do you   know I always thought there was some thing magical in the falling of the tents, but I should call this taking down the tents!"     As she said the word tents, she   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     213 glanced over her shoulder an instant, and on looking back to see the cause of the huzzas, she was so startled at the collapsed appearances of the camp-ground, she fairly shrieked. Every one laughed that heard the "O ' " anil saw the affright depicted on her face. Unhappy Lieutenant Saberin stood off near the Colonel, not daring to approach either of his flames, lest he should be rolled up like a scroll. Lieutenant Alton came up, " looking lovely," in his travelling suit,-"All ready for the omnibus Miss De Save?" ;' Yes, I need not return to the hotel." She bid lone a tender good-bye, wishing they might meet again. Lieutenant Mera scarcely touched Ione's hand, saying, 1"Remember what I said the night I came near drowning you!" lone looked up, her eyes welled over, and she said, "I will, Lieutenant Mera; I promise you I will not act unad- visedly." The omnibus stopped in front of camp, and the many that were to leave, bade adieu again and again, to their friends. Lieutenant Alton ran back twice to shake hands with Ione. Lieutenant Mera returned to linger a moment near, and gave one look of agony that lone never forgot. "Well, I should not wonder if he should change his mind about marrying a rich girl, for he looks at Miss De Saye very lovingly," thought she. She walked off the camp- ground perfectly unconscious that she had come there with any one, till she found the polished young artist had kept near her and was now at her side. He walked to the hotel with her, and bade her adieu in a very graceful manner. She met Lieutenant Burlyton, who faced about, and offered her his arm, stepping as if he were walking over dogs and cats. A bleak smile played coldly over her face. He sighed like a blacksmith's bellows, and repeated in the saddest, and sweetest way - "Alas, for my weary and care-haunted bosom!

Singing "Ri tu, di nu, di na?" "You are a host of joy in yourself, Lieutenant Burly- ton. I cannot be very miserable, while you are left; I wishl every body was just like you, and then this world would not be such a " weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, unweed- ed garden." He answered in a half bitter, half sentimental way, "Don't you know that the people wont employ A man who wrongs his manliness, by laughing like a boy? And suspects the azure blossom that unfolds upon the shoot, As if wisdom's old potato could not flourish at its root."  lone laughed heartily.  They went into the parlor and she sung, "Robin Adair," for him.  He was much affect- ed, said it was his lullaby when he was a baby, that slhe must stop or she would have him  boo-hoo-ing right out. But he was ha-ha-ing a few moments after, and becggingr her "To take him  for her lover, and let all those incon- stant swains glide, they were not worth one of those invalu- able pearls he saw in her eyes, when he met her." At parade Mrs. Bobaline was startled by hearing the order read that Lieutenant Bobaline was ordered to Wash- ington immediately. She clung to Ione's arm, and looked into her face aghast. She could not tell whether she was glad or sorry. After she had regained her composure, slie sai(, "I wonder. if Lieutenant B. has applied    to be relieved. In his last letter, he said he would be at home soon, but dreaded the duties of West Point more than ever." The ladies gathered round her to express their sincere sorrow at the prospect of losing one who had been the life of the post. The officers stood off in front of the "officers' quarters,'" making their own comments.  Lieu- tenant Saberin left them and walked after Mrs. Bobaline as she left the parade ground. He politely expressed his   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.      1 regret that she was going, and said the winter would be unt endurable; but if this political excitement continued, they would probably all meet at Washington. ;' Yes." cried Lieutenant Burlyton, "' as the beavers do at the hatter's. That's fur enough from--from--" "From one head!" laughed lone.  "I fear you'll need a scratch after that." "I think you have given me one, ' free gratis.'" "If we have war, I hope Lieutenant B. will resign! If he does not, I shall go home to Florida." "Don't ' secesh,' while under orders, Mrs. Bobaline; that would not be honorable, you know!" said Lieutenant Burlyton. "4I think things are coming to a pretty pass, if there is to be a war because Southerners will not free their slaves, and work their plantations themselves, like your great northern men do. I presume that at home, this President of yours was no better than any slave in the South! ac- tually dioging in his own farm! Just think of putting such a man to rule over gentlemen. Lieutenant Saberin glanced scornfully at her, while Lieutenant Burlyton called a dragoon to haul down those stars and stripes and run up a palm-leaf fan, which threw Mrs. Bobaline and Mrs. Maryglot into spasms of laughter. Mrs. Bobaline turned away angry at herself for counte- nancing him in his ridicule of her dear, sacred South. Lieutenant Saberin walied between her and lone to the hotel, and took seats on the piazza. Lieutenant Burlyton offered Madamn Maryglot his arm, and conversed quite intelligibly till they arrived at the foot of the steps. He said, "Let's go and make friends with poor Mrs. Bobaline,' and rushed along the piazza, dragging the old lady by the arm, until he confronted Mrs. Bobaline. 'He bowed to the floor.

"Ha! ha I ha! O, you fool I " screamed the amiable old lady, in-great distress. ARTICLE FIRST." "To break the company into platoons." Lieutenant Bobaline returned in a few days, and insist- ed that Ione should spend the winter in Washington, with them.  Viola was heart-broken at leaving Lieutenant Saberin and her cadet friends, but Washington contained many to interest a beautif'l woman, and she consoled her- self with the thoughts of what a Phillipa she would be there. Lieutenant Saberin made himself perfectly fascina- ting now that Lieutenant Mera was gone, and with his beau- ty and sweetness of manner and disposition, a woman must be adamant not to do as our heroines did, fall in love anew with him. He was kind and considerate with lone, never al- lowing the slightest change, or shade of change of his ten- derness toward her, gave her no opportunity to find fault with him. She could scarcely recognize him as the same m'am. Mrs. Bobaline was occupied in making preparations for her winter's campaign, and overseeing her packing; but when she did appear, Lieutenant Saberin was her ever ready and willing attendant. On the morning of her de- parture, Ione said farewell to West Point with deep re- gret. She was to leave Madam Maryglot, who however promised to go after them as soon as the cold weather com- mencedl. She must say good-bye to jolly Lieutenant Bur- lyton. What should she do for some one to make her laugh   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.      217 when she was sad, and say touching things when she was laughing? But he said he should apply to be stationed near her, and resign if Mr. Secretary did not comply. Cadet Smith would come to see her as soon as he gradu- ated, and Lieutenant Saberin accompanied them as far as New York, and whispered to Ione that if he was not or- dered to Washington before spring, he should get a leave to spend a week with her. These asurances robbed her sev- eral partings of their sting. "To re-form the company." Arrived in Washington, the first persons Mrs. Bobaline and Ione met, were Lieutenants Alton and Mera; now bosom friends. They greeted the party as if they were relatives. The first question Lieutenant Mera asked Lieu- tenant Bobaline, was, "Are yoa going to stand firmn?" Lieutenant Bobaline grasped his hand, saying, "I can't give up the old stars and stripes! I cannot- fight under any thing else! How axe you?  "Firm as a rock!" said Mera. Lieutenant Alton waved his cap above their heads, repeating, "O'er the proud heads of freemen, our star-banner waves, Men firm as their mountains and still as their graves!"  "You know Ambert has gone over?" said Lieutenant Mera. "' Gone under, you mean!"Lieutenant Bobaline replied.

She told lone all the news, broughlt her a love-letter friom Lieutenant Saberin. and a bouquet of au- tumn leaves, from Lieutenant Smith, which she wore in her hair to the President's levee, then pressed them on Bristol board, and framed them to hang in her room. Lieutenant Mera had introduced to her a lovely Vyoun1g girl, the daughter of an M. C., -Miss Mary Greellleaf. He had been very attentive to this lady, so much so, that Ione was jealous for Miss De Save, who had been spirited away almost immediately after her arrival in Washingrton, by Lieutenant Ambert and lady, seeming to feel w-orse at parting with Lieutenant Alton than with Lieutenant Mera. lone began to suspect an engagement between her new friend and her old beau, Lieutenant Mera. He was strange- ly variable in his treatment of lone, sometimes with tile affectionate familiarity of a brother, and at others cold and distant, as if he was deeply offended. Madam Mary- glot, the repository for all her sorrows, would be duly in- forined, and then she would forget it all till the next time.

Lieutenants Smith and Corridor she saw whenever they came in from camp. Her weariness of everything in Wash- ington was not abated by the reception of a letter from her sister younger than herself. It had gone thousands of miles out of its way, came to West Point after her depart- ure from that post, and was forwarded to her. "SAN FRANCISCO March 25, 1861. Darling Isie. You wish me to write, to atone for all mamma's omis- sions by telling you every thing we do every day! Well, you know the old routine, studies, rides, sails, etc. There are some charming young officers here now. Our lovely Dr. H. brings them to spend the evenings with us, and Edes- tina often comes in, and then we wish for you, and Gertrude is called upon for the sweet songs she warbles so like a bird; her favorite she always sings, "1 Farewell! - but whenever you welcome the hour," and when she murmurs, "I wish she were here!" we all join in but mamma,--I'll not tell you what she does. The spring and summer has been very gay, but as I have not " come out " yet, I see but little of it. Now ' I'll wager," as mamma says, that you have not been written a word about our holidays, and all our presents. Yours were bought the same as if you were here! You wrote about the deckings of churches, etc. witl evergreens. t"The sweet spring comes to deck our lovely land!" For three days before Christmas, mamma, Dr. I., and Lieutenant I)e See, and us four girls, attended the sales and auction at Blank and Flash Halls, and the Dr. said that the scene rivalled Paris. He said, that we saw enough Japanese cabinets sold, to "' furiish one to every house here, and then supply Washington with a new one every week for the next four years!"

There was delightful music, and the children played and danced, and Grace had her arms full of gifts, and a stocking full the next morning. New Year's eve a terrible shower set in, and we feared we should have a rainy day for our calls. Gertrude and Edestina came in all the rain, and we were all to sleep in your room. It stormed till nearly twelve o'clock, and then we sat in the open window, not a breath of wind stirring, and the moon shone like day on the bay, turning the crest of the waves all to snow. O, it was glorious! Gertrude sang, and Edestina too. We were saluted at twelve with the booming of cannon. At seven o'clock the next morning we threw open our windows, and it was June! The warm rain had brought out all your delicious flowers in full bloom; the warm sunshine turned everything to gold, and across the bay, the ridge three thousand feet high, you know the snow on its top looked like a vast opal, With the rays of the sun, while the warm ravines at its base in their green freshness was like an emerald setting. The birds were flitting about and the humming bird clinging to the legumes of the locust trees, made it all look like fairy-land. We dressed as quickly as possible, and went into the gar- den to cull flowers to deck our tables and parlors. Thle Jeddo urn on the side-board, we filled with gilly flowers, ver- benas, red and white roses, fuchias, veronica, abutilons, mignionette and heliotropes, and locusts and acacias, all out of our own garden, and all the Japanese vases were filled with flowers. Your Lamarque roses, and Australian pea, made a lovely bouquet.

He knew Dr. H. very well - had been with him in Mexico.

At length one of them directs the attention of the rest to a foreigner,- a distinguished looking young man, with a lady leaning on his arm, ' Who are those? She is the most beautiful woman I have seen to night," he said. The gentlemen stared and admired, but did not know. The eldest of the party questioned some one standing near, and found the gentleman to be a young attache, but could not learn who the lady was, - surmised her to be his wife. The first officer that spoke, vowed he must know who she was, and with this view set off after them to ascertain vewho their acquaintances might be, but they appeared to know only each other, as they looked " neither here nor there," but into each other's faces. He said " they are not married, but may be engaged," and tried to distinguish how they addressed each other, but they spoke so low, he could only hear that they were conversing in French. The more he watched the girl's beautiful face and graceful play of features, the more interested he became, and the fact that she was a foreigner, and evidently the young man's betrothed, only  added to his flame.  Late in the evening found him still her shadow, yet not once had the heavenly blue eyes rested on him, so entirely were they engrossed by the pair of dark hazel ones at her side. "She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew-- As seeking not to know it, And kept her heart serene, within its zone ; There was an awe in the homage which she drew Her spirit seemed as seated on a throne, Apart from the surrounding world, and strong In its own strength, - most strange in one so young."    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6558-00000112"/> 224         Tactics; or, Still lingering near the unconscious pair, he was startled by a hand laid on his shoulder, and a familiar voice. "O Saberin, you here?"He started as if he had been shot when he saw Lieutenant Bobaline. They shook hands and went in search of the ladies. He found lone not at all inferior to the belles of Washington in her San Fran- ciscan ball dress, and Indian jewels, and took, what he sup- posed was his place beside her, but she was lost to the world for the hour, in listening to the wiling voice of a fascinating little R. N. to whom she introduced her inevit- able inheritor; but the R. N. stood his ground, without the slightest idea of giving up the ship, and stood by her till the last man left, in search of Madam Bobaline, who showed too plainly her delight at the addition of this brilliant to her crown. "Where are you stopping? you must come to us!" "Beyond a question, what would be more charming than to re-form our West Point circle, complete in Wash- ington!" It was farthest from his thoughts at that mo- ment to change his hotel, at least not till he had accom- plished an object, and that was to find out his incognita. He could not at once give up his habit of going on from "conquering to conquer." Lieutenant Bobaline came to say, they must go home to breakfast. Lieutenant Saberin attended Ione to the carriage, whis- pering a tender little speech about his happiness being complete, as they drove away! "MANUAL." "For relieving Sentinels." At the fashionable hour for calling, Lieutenant Saberin dressed in all the " pride and pomp of glorious war," thought he would see the buildings of interest, and then call on lone. He accordingly took himself to see the home of the Russian minister. There were many more   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps. abroad on the same errand, that is, reviewing the public buildings.                       - "There were foreigners of much renown, Of various nations, and all Volunteers; Not fighting for the country or its crown, But wishing to be one day brigadiers; Also to have the sacking of a town ; A pleasant thing to young men of their years, 'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith, Sixteen called Russell, and nineteen named Smith! i' Lieutenant Saberin promenaded past Russian Place, after a very troubadourish fashion, gazing as a miner would for glittering ore, but no soft blue eyes looked forth from the casement, or golden locks gleamed from the doorway, and too late, for his call, he hurried to his hotel, lest he should lose his dinner. At a most unheard-of hour, when all ladies of taste, are "' snoozing!"Lieutenant Saberin sent his card up to Miss Smith.    She was alone in the parlor, Viola was permitting "Sleep to kill those pretty eyes, And give as soft attachment to her senses As infants- empty of all thought." As he entered, Ione arose saying, "I feel the breezes of West Point fanning my cheek, when I see you, Lieliten- ant Saberin!" "Yes, and they sent their regards to you and a kiss," said he laughing. "But ah, West Point is sadly changed." t  "Changed? West Point cannot change.     Her beauties changeless, her hills everlasting, her Hudson exhaustless, and her sunsets to eternity, "Fairest of all that earth beholds, the hues, That live among the clouds, and flush the air Lingering and deepening at the hour of dews."

'" Ione said, "Really, you should have an audience, you recite so well!" "I wish no more appreciative audience, than I have at present." She asked if he had seen many he knew since he came. He replied, no - he had spent the morning looking at the buildings. She asked in surprise, if he had never been in Washing- ton before. "O yes, many times! but there are sights of beauty we cannot see too often!" He could not appear himself, was restless, at last plead an engagement, and promised to call soon again. A few moments after he left, Mary Greenleaf entered to tell lone she was going to ride on horseback. '"Why did you not come in sooner? I would have in- troduced you to such a handsome young officer!" "I am always a ' day after the fair,' why didn't you send for me?" "I will when he comes again." The girls chatted on till it was time for the ride. Ione stood in the window, and watched her out of sight. She felt a little sad about Lieu tenant Saberin's call, - it had left an unpleasant impression on her heart, and she intuitively attacked the book-case, for Pickwick, which she had not seen since she left West Point. She took the old volume down, with a very solemn face, but before long forgot her own griefs, to be happy "with Samivel."   When Viola came down, she told her of Lieutenant Saberin's call, and gave his pleasant messages; but she received them very ungraciolsly, was indignant that she was not sent for, while poor Ione would gladly   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.     227 have exchanged places with her, and given her i;he call and taken in its place her painless sleep. Some one knocked. Mrs. Bobalihne called "Come!"

New Orleans, why don't you stand 99 true by 100 firm for our country's flag of 34 stars?" Mrs. Bobaline entered the lists, for his resigning at once. "They will make you a Brig!" "I would rather be shot a Lieutenant under my flag, than resign and b a a Napoleon!" "4 Well, they'll beat you any way, and take you prison- er?" she replied, sneering. "' The flag of our Union forever.' Is Washington safe?" said lone. "4 Not quite if they attack us now, I fear; but it soon will be," he replied thoughtfully. "$ Now that the 7th have arrived," said Mrs. Bobaline. War, war, war! was the only topic discussed by small and great, and Washington was one "' tented field," and ladies drove to the camps to see parades, and drills, and meet their friends. Lieutenant Saberin daily gave hours of toil, and inches of sole, to the pursuit of beauty " under difficulties."    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6558-00000114"/> 228         Tactics; or, "ARTICLE SIXTEENTH."

This decision leads him up the Avenue early one afternoon, fearing that he should not meet her, yet hoping against hope. A lady and gentleman dash by him on horseback. 'Tis she, and the young foreigner! He follows them at a rapid pace, but he is soon distanced, and they have turned off the Avenue, and are out of sight. Disappointment clouds his brow. But they must return I He will while away the time by sitting in Madam Bobaline's windows, and watch- ing for the only woman in whom he now feels any inter- est. He accordingly repaired to their hotel, sends up his card, and waits for the ladies. On a chair in the window stands a bijou,- a lady's work basket. Supposing it to be Ione's, he takes it up, and showing a very gentlemanly curiosity, examines its contents. He finds a tiny book, formed of a sheet of note paper, folded till it was but two inches square. He opened it and was surprised at the date, written in a very familiar hand, but dated years be- fore he had seen Ione. He looks again; the writing is' not Ione's, nor is it Mrs. Bobaline's, but more familiar than either. Then the date,--why should that recall memories of the past? He reads- Oct. 27, 1856. I wait for thee, as morning waits With dewy eye, the coming sun, My soul sits trembling at her gates, To greet her best beloved one!   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps.      229 I wait for thee as waits the flower- I droop for thee as droops the flower, Beneath the noon-tide's fervor deep- Ere pitying stars at twilight hour, Put on their snowy veils to weep. He turns the leaf, and reads JMarch, 1869. I waited for thee-- -ah, how long! You came - but ah, how changed . Your self-conceit was -- ah, how strong ' Self, in the shade at 90 ranged! Both dates came up before him like apparitions. He was as much surprised as he would have been in his cadet days, by the appearance of the " great highankadank," one his post at dead of night. What a strange magic there is about dates! How they thrill one, as they are seen on the letter or page. the figures that have brought to us some joy or sorrow, and how strangely near, becomes the inscriber of those figures! The rest of the tiny book is a blank, and he begins again to read its contents. He has just fin- ished as Mrs. Bobaline and Ione enter. He quickly put the little record in his breast pocket. He sat conversing for a long time, often glancing out of the window, but the fair equestrian did not make her appearance. Impatient and weary he was about to excuse himself and seek her through the streets again, when a low tap, tap, tap! said some one was coming, and   Mary Greenleaf entered. When she saw a strange gentleman, she hesitated and said, "I came to get my work-basket!" She approached the chair, took the basket and changing color painfully, ex- cused herself and retired.  Lieutenant Saberin moved away to the window, shocked to find his long neglected blue-eyed one, and the beautiful foreigner he had been pursuing so untiringly, were one and the same person! This at once solved the enigma of the little blank-book, its dates, and familiar hand-writing. What had changed her so? - Had a few years wrought such a transforma- tion? With a profound sigh, he turned to the ladies,    <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6558-00000115"/> 230         Tactics; or, trying to look wonderfully indifferent.  "Who is -the young lady?" lone answered, "She is the daughter of the Hon. Mr. Greenleaf. They are stopping here, isn't she lovely?" "' Yes! Is she engaged to the young foreigner with whom she rides?" he asked as deliberately as if each word was the last he could utter. "O, he is wild about her, but she, - I am not her con- fidant- I cannot say." lone showed in her manner that there was something she would like to say, but did not. She was thinking about Lieutenant Mera. Lieutenant Saberin bade her good day, saying he would see her often as possible, as in these times, they knew not what a day would bring forth. She shuddered, for she had seen all the terrible prepara- tions with an aching heart; fully realizing that they were more than a gay parade, or an idle pageant on West Point. Had not Sumter borne testimony to the stern reality, the wild forgetfulness of all that we hold sacred? the lives of our precious ones there - our hero-martyrs, was it a dream to them in their prison of flame - their fiery fur- nace, from which they came, pure gold, to shine forever in our crown of Freedom?  Noble men! When forsaken by men, God delivered, to show how He could save! May the God of battles be their shield in like manner, in every hour of trial. lone sat in the window, till the gray twi- liglht deepened round her, realizing in all its terrors the dark cloud that hung over our beloved land. Every hour brought nearer the fearful. struggle. Hearts must know anguish, deeper than death, and "men must work, and women must weep."  O, why? Will the " by and by" tell us? "O, wonderful visions of long ago! Lighting so the warm young brain, You've lost your aura of golden glow, You, are tarnished now, by the touch of pain. Can Love retint what rust hath lain?

Mrs. Bobaline came in with a letter from Colonel Boba- line, in Western Virginia.    The gas was lighted and the letter read. Lieutenant Mera entered, and they were ea- gerly discussing the news it contained, - the victory under their glorious young General. "1 Colonel Burlyton is with us," it said, (" the same brave, noble fellow he was at West Point. He is idolized by his men."    I knew he would be!" exclaimed Lieutenant Mera warmly. "' He is too pleasant and lovely for a warrior, I wish he were here!" said lone. Tap, tap, and the gentle Mary Greenleaf opened the door. Lieutenant Mera shook her hand kindly, and told her about the letter and Colonel Burlyton, what lone just said, and how lie envied him.    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6558-00000116"/> 232         Tactics; or, 4 Dear old West Point!" -cried Ione, and they began re- calling reminiscences of that enchanting spot. One said "Do you remember?" and then another, till a perfect picture gallery was established, whose bright colors and fa- miliar scenes brought back words and smiles long forgotten, whose reflected light brightened the faces gathered round the table. "Miss lone, you remember one morning playing the 'officer's call,' and all of us rushing in, to see who was calling us?" asked Lieutenant Mera, in a livelier humor than lone had seen him in since her early acquaintance with him. "' Yes, indeed! and the scolding Viola gave me for being so improper! But do you remember that you tried to make me promise to play it when I wished to see you, and you would come directly?"   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.     233 The partings came. Colonel Burlyton fresh from, and flushed with victory, came with his great heart and sono- rous voice to cheer on our troops. Captains Alton and Saberin brought him to see the ladies. He sang for them, "The soldier's dream," and "Ah, doth not a meeting like this make amends," drawing tears from every eye. Captain Alton looking like a young David, with his gentle blue eyes and beautiful hair, came to say "' good night, until the morrow." It was all he would say; his hopes were high. He commanded a battery.    Captain Mera came not. What! gone without one word? AV, so true love should do; it cannot speak. Captain Saberin came last of all, determined to bid them good bye cheerily, as Alton had done, but was petrified to find Ione and Mary Greenleaf sobbing in each other's arms! Ione bowed her cold brow for him to kiss. He shook hands with Mrs. Bobaline who was nearly in hysterics, and flinging one glance to Mary, who had retreated to the sofa, he fled from the room. Poor Mary!

God knows! This is one of the most beautiful nights the imagination can conceive. The sky is perfectly clear, and the air as serene and still as that of Eden. The bright moon cast the woods which bound the field into deep shad- ows, through which the camp-fires shed a clear and brilliant glow. From the crest of the hill, the scene is a picture of enchantment.  On the extreme right, in the neighbor- hood of the Fire Zouaves, a party were singing the "Star Spangled Banner; " and from the left rose the sweet strains of a magnificent- band, interminglingr opera airs, like the beautiful serenade of Don Pasquale, with the patriotic bursts of "Hail Coluinbia,"   and  "Yankee Doodle." From far beyond the woods came the hum of the hosts encamped in'the extreme rear.  How many to-night either in their heart's deep silence, or in converse with friends- new found, or mayhap " grappled together with hooks of steel," quoted More's touching lines.

Fathers against sons, they had blest and taught to lisp their evening prayer; broth- ers who had slept, clasped in each other's arms, in the same little crib, under the same roof-tree. Class-mates, whose hands have pressed the sacred volume, when they swore by the Almighty God, to be true to their coun- try and the constitution. Friends that have stood the test in hours of trial, and deep woe!

Even in the wilderness the sacred day seems purer and more hushed than any other.

To becloud the clearness of that serene atmosphere with the rude clangor of the avant messenger, that heralded our challenge to a disloyal foe. The fortunes of the day rose and fell like the waves of a mighty ocean; we heard continuous tidings of heroism and victory; we could catch glimpses of the advances and retreats, could hear occasion- ally the guns of a battery before undiscovered, could guess   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.        ,37 how   terribly all this accumulation of death upon death must tell upon those undaunted men, but could also see- and our cheers continually followed the knowledge -   that our forces were gradually driving the right of the enemy around the second quarter of a circle, until by ten o'clock the main battle was raging  directly opposite where it had commenced six hours before!  We heard of the intrepidity of Burnside and Sprague; how    the devoted and daring young governor led the regiment he had so munificiently equipped, again and again to victorious charges, and at last spiked with his own hands the guns he could not carry away!  The victory seemed ours.  It was an hlour sublime in unlselfistlness, and apparently glorious in its results. The question was quickly to be decided for us. "t The issue of this hard fought battle, in which certainly our troops lost no credit, in their conflict on the field with an enemy ably commanded, superior in numbers, who had but a short dis- tance to march, and who acted on his own ground on the defensive, and always under cover, whilst our men were of necessity on the open field, should not prevent full cred- it being given to those officers and corps whose services merited success if they did not attain it." Such is the his- tory of a day.   Why hid not the sun his face filom   such a scene? "Give me the death of those Who for their country die; And oh! be mine like their repose When cold and low they lie! Their loveliest mother earth Enshrines the fallen brave; In her sweet lap, who gave them birth, They find their tranquil grave." "The prayers of fair women, like legions of angels, Watch over our soldiers by day and by night ; And the King of all glory, the chief of all armies, Shall love them and lead them, who dare to be right As each column sweeps by, Hear their hearts' battle-cry,- It was Warren's,-' Tis sweet for our ccuntry to die!'

They followed each other, or sought their chambers alone, weeping and praying by turns. Madam Marvglot gave way to her own great heart, by denouncing the demagogues and politicians in good healthy English, forgetting her accomplishments in her honest ire, at the sorrow and terror of those she 'saw weeping around her. Occasionally she would break forth into sneers, tlhat there was no head to our affairs; that of we only hlad a king, he could send at once and take the miscreants, and hanl them as high as Haman. :' Shame on the American people, for their sleepiness, allowing traitors to disarm tlhe government, and then bully them or destroy their country!

This was strong meat for the broken and crushed spirits she was haranguing, and she -received no reply. Then she would tell them stories of heroic women, who freed their country by their super-feminine bravery. Joan 6T Arc, and Charlotte Corday were introduced, but her " words were as idle tales " to those whose bowed heads were humbled, whose hearts were bleeding. Again she would endeavor to read to them, but finally gave it up and entered into the grief and anxiety of those most vehement in their great agony for their absent ones. She ran through the house for news, till one would have thought her own sons were on that awful field. Whenever she heard a regiment or bat- tery named she cried, "Is there any one I know in that battery or regiment?" Her mind was in the wildest con- fusion as to the whereabouts of her favorites. She had   Cupid in Shoulder Straps.     239 them numbered on her fingers, and before reading the papers would count them over as if she were saying avas for their souls :--"Colonel Bobaline in Western Virginia; Colonel Burlyton, Fairfax court-house; Captain Alton in command of a battery, Captain Saberin, Assistant Adjutant General ; Captain Mera, Aid de camp ; Lieutenant Smith, Griffin's battery; Lieutenant Corridor, Sherman's battery." Long before she could finish her drolly numbered list, every one present was smiling through their tears. Mrs. Bobaline was sadly tried by receiving little missives from the rebel colonel, beggilng for one word, that she had no interest at stake at Washing'ton, she was a Southerner ; her husband was a rebel agrainst his own land. She an- swered one or two of them, but gave no very ilmportant information, till she became alarmed lest she should be ar- rested, when she wrote to him not to dare to write to her again. Madam Maryglot suspected her of disloyalty, and im- proved all occasions to rant at wolves in sheep-skins, andl pretended friends, till they came to be open enemies. In the darkest moment of suspense, she would taunt her with being sorry that we were triumphant, or glad that we were beaten, when really the poor lady was nearer dead than alive, fearing to hear that some one she Joved was killed. Madam M. was better than any news-boy of the city; she would make her appearance and astonish a group of listen- ers with, "Our army is outflanked.  General Lee is threatening Washington! McDowell is encircled with bay- onets, had nothing else to do but surrender at discretion." Shle would stand and watch the effect of this piece of intel- ligence upon her listeners, as one administering laughinggas to an audience would do, in a highly scientific manner. When they were a little come to themselves, she would leave them for new supplies.

It is twelve o'clock at night, and the doors of private houses are open, groups of sleep- less ones are on the steps and on the side walks, hearing and telling the latest news in undertones. Afar the faint rolling of the drum of the different regiments hastening tow- ards General McDowell's head quarters is heard, the city is awake but silent, as if the last trump had brought the inhabi- tants of a " city of silence," from their dark beds and houses. Toward morning the rumbling on the pavements of wagons going to the camps, the trampling of the courier's horse galloping in the avenue, and the conversation in the streets are all that is heard. At one o'clock a regiment passes Willard's. Three cheers are exchanged between the citizens and the soldiers, and they take their run down the avenue. Colonel Burnside came into town on Monday evening, and after an interview of a quarter of an hour with General Mansfield, returned to join his brigade.  His hat and coat were riddled with balls, and his face grimed with dust. He did not say a word to the persons who obstructed his passage in the lobby of Willard's. Colonel Burnside, you are not alone in your speechless agony, America, the world is dumb with grief! THE BATTLE FIELD. "Here you might see Barons and peasants on the embattled field, Slain or half dead, in one huge ghastly heap, Promiscuously amassed. With dismal groans And ejaculation in the pangs of death, Some call for aid neglected; some overturned In the fierce --hock, lie gasping, and expire, Trampled by fiery coursers: Horror thus And wild uproar, and desolation reigned Unrespited." A   voung rebel officer moves cautiously among the wound(ed and dying and dead, on the scene of the late bloody encounter. His large eyes are dilated, his lips com- pressed; his breath comes quick and hard like that of a   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,     241 dying man, as he motions to his men rather than give them orders, to execute his wishes. He fears each ghast- ly face will reveal the well remembered features of a rel- ative, a class-mate, or bosom friend. A low moan call. him to the sideoof an officer, lying on his face. He carefully raises him, wipes the black dust away, and lo! a cherished friend! He lays his hand on the heart. 'It still beats. He calls for water, bathes the face and raises him in his arms. A groan very low 4ad faint comes from the parted lips, tears rain on the pale face, and an outhurst of manly grief causes the dying man to open his eyes. He sees a loved class-mate. A sad smile plays like the light of a win- try suln, for an instant around the purple mouth, and he is insensible again. "Alton, Alton, my friend, ' Would to God I had died for thee!' cried Lieutenant Ambert. The men gathered around him, and the great hearts leaped to the eyes, and ran in big drops over the rough faces stained with powder and blood. He is no longer a foe, they no longer thirst for his blood. He is raised tenderly in strong arms, and borne to the hospital. Lieutenant Ambert watches him night and day. Weeks of suffering and the loving care of two lovely women, Mrs. Lieutenant Ambert and Pauline DeSaye, brought him to a state warranting a careful removal to New Orleans, to the home of Mrs. Ambert. A relapse was the consequence, and a fever en- sued. The physician gave him up to die, a clergyman was called, and at Lieutenant Alton's request united him and his frantic Pauline, in the holy bonds of marriage, in the presence of Madam De Saye, who already loved him with a mother's fondness ; indeed, it was impossible to look into his sunny blue eyes, and ingenuous face, and not be- come attached to him,- so Pauline thought. As the crisis of the fever approached, she hung over him, unwilling to be relieved for a moment, as if calmly resolved to die with him. The crisis came. The morning broke gray and chil- ly, the mist creeping through the open casements like spir- its from a "city of silence," throwing a death dew on the faces of Pauline and him she would have died to save "    <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6558-00000121"/> a42         Tactics; or, The physician returning after but two hours' absence, was shocked to find his patient gone, as he supposed, and the young wife fallen, apparently as lifeless, forward on his bosom. Pauline had listened to the last sigh of her lover, and throwing herself on his pillow, swooned. "Alas, the love of woman! it is known To be a lovely and a fearful thing; For all of theirs upon that die is thrown, And if 'tis lost, life has no more to bring To them, but mockeries of the past alone!" Pauline had seen her mother looking exhausted and worn-out, and persuaded her to retire for a little rest. Half an hour after, Lieutenant Alton rose in the bed, a faint sigh only escaping him, the terrified Pauline threw her- self on the pillow beside him, and swooned. The whole house was like a church yard, so noiseless and still. The physician rang the bell, took up Pauline and bore her into the open air. The servants came, but at the sight of their loved young mistress, fled through the house crying 1"Miss'es Lena dead!"The household gathered round her, making every effort to restore her to consciousness. At last -the light of life came to the staring eveballs, but seeing the 'anxious faces hanging over her, she appeared to compre- hend it all, and swooned again. She was borne to her cham- ber, and a brain fever supervening, she lay in blessed un- consciousness of her sorrows for ten days; and when God in his mercy restored her reason, the first eyes she looked into were those of an angel! ay those of one dearer to lier than all the angels in heaven - her husband's! As time sped on, our dead restored to life, lived but for each other. Every ray of intelligence respecting the war was kept from Lieutenant Alton, but there were times when he seemed to realize his position -an officer of the Gov- ernment - a captive, doubly indebted to his captors for life - and a-- husband! Long hours he would sit and ponder, thinking of that terrible day, - of his comrades: in arms, - of his noble friend Ambert, of his gentle and   Cupid in Shoulder-Straps,.    2 loving nurses - and last though not least, of his distracted country; and he would bow his sick and weak head on his hand and sob like an infant, as if his heart was broken! Pauline would get her guitar and accompanying it with her delicious voice, soothe his melancholy, causing him to feel as he looked upon her, that he would almost forfeit heaven itself to gaze on the heaven of her face! In the list of the brave among the. reports culled from the national 'papers, Pauline discovered her husband's name among many of his class-mates and friends. She knew they would be precious to him, and kept them sacredly for him. She surprised him one morning with her treasures in his hand, eagerly devouring their contents while the tears rapidly followed each other over his emaciated face. "In conclusion, it gives me great satisfaction to state that the conduct of the officers and enlisted men of the sever- al batteries was most exemplary. Exposed throughout the day to a galling fire of artillery and small arms, sever- al times charged by cavalry, and more than once aban- doned by their infantry supports, both officers and enlist- ed men manfully stood by their guns with a courage and de- votion worthy of the highest commendation. Where all did so well it would be invidious to make distinction, I there- fore simply give the names of all the officers engaged. viz. Major Hunt, Captains Carlisle, Ayers, Griffin, Tid- ball and Arnold. Lieutenants Plat, Ransom, Thompson, Webb, Green, Edwards, Dresser, Wilson, Throckmorton, Cushing, Harris, Butler, Fuller, Lyford, Well, Benjamin, Babbit, Haines, Ames, Hasbrouck, Kensell, Harrison, Reed, Barlow, Noyes, Kirby, and Elderkin."

The last sad hour of Freedom's dream, And valor's task, moved slowly by; While mute they watched till morning's beam, Should rise and give them light to die! There's yet a world where souls are free, Where tyrants taint not nature's bliss ;- If death that world's bright portal be, O, who would live a slave in this?" lone stood with the crowd, in the parlor, to hear the latest news from the dead and dying! At length, among a number of officers that entered the hall, she thought she saw Lieutenant Mera.    How could she be sure it was he? How see him? She walked the hall rapidly, now leaning on the balustrade, now   going to the window, fearing she should see him go away. As she turned she saw the piano open.   Like a flash she thought of his promise to come if she played the officers' call. She touched the keys softly, fearing the people would think her wild. She listened, but he did not come. She thought herself foolish to think he would remember such     a thing at such a time, but she would try once more, and from very weakness she sat down on the piano stool, leaned her head on the piano, and struck the notes, one after another, as firmly and as distinctly as she could.

He bends over her and whispers that she shall go to see him; he will take her now. She rises mechanically and goes to her room. Deeply veiled she returns to him. They thread the thronged streets filled with the terrified residents, and the half-crazed, blood stained and terrible soldiers. They reach the hospital, and stand beside the pallet on which he lies. His eye has no intelligence, but wanders as if in search of some one. His lips are drawn, as if his agonies were more than mor- tal could bear. His dark curls lay in masses on his pallid brow. Ione trembling violently, leans over him, her eyes set, and lips apart, ready to faint. His eye rests on her a moment, and he raises his hand toward her, but it falls again, and he closes his eyes and murmurs "Mary!

Lieutenant Mera asked what he thought, giving him to understand they were very near friends of the wounded officer. He gave Ione a look of pity, and said, "I imagine he is not dangerously wounded, but his life hangs upon the discre- tion of his friends," which gentle hint Lieutenant Mera took, and led her away.  They entered the carriage, and lone leaned back and closed her eyes, the fountain was stirred and tears camne to her relief. Lieutenant Mera raised her veil and said, " lone I did wrong to take you to him, he was only raving."

"Her every sense Had been overstrung by pangs intense; And each frail fibre of her brain, (As bow strings when relaxed by rain, The erring arrows launch aside,) Sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide." "No, he was not raving! I thank God you took me, that I might know, for a certainty, all I suspected so long. Why did I ever come where none are true? Lieutenant Mera, I told you, I would not act, but who was there to feel an interest in me, except - - indifferent friends?" "Ah, Miss Ione, I an indifferent friend? My heart is all your own, and God knows what I have sufferled since I knew you - --because I am poor!" he muttered bitterly. He leaned back in the carriage. "Juan Alcantara! un- natural man!" " Juan Alcantara! The truest man that ever lived! I love that name!" 1"What mean you, Ione? Juan Alcantara was my un- natural uncle, for whom I was namned." Ione hid her face in her hands. Her unhappiness seem- ed to have culminated. Lieutenant Mera forgot all his own wrongs and griefs to comfort her. He took her hand and for the second time essayed to put the mysterious ring on her finger. "Have faith in me, dearest lone." She raised the ring to her lips and the tears flowed un- restrainedly. "Ione! dear Ione! Why do you weep?" "Juan! you spoke prophetically when you called this ring the key to your destiny.

"O, father! I must go to the hospital, if I do not I shall die!" The eyes of Mr. Greenleaf rested tenderly on his daughter; great tears stood in his eyes. "My darling child, it will kill you if you go! and I fear we cannot see him." "I must, I must!" she said, throwing her arms around his neck. He loosened her hand, to go for the carriage. She rushed to her room and tied a thick veil over her bonnet, that none might recognize the tear-stained face beneath. As they entered the room the surgeon was ordering the nurse to keep him very quiet - and he might live. "O, may I not speak one word to him, doctor?"Mary cried passionately. lMay I not hear his voice once more! 9) "Please be quiet, madam,"' the surgeon answered. "He is very weak, and does not recognize any one." Mary threw back her veil, and regardless of everything, knelt at the side of him she loved, and whispered "Ulm!" At the familiar sound, he opened his eyes a moment with a glad look on 'his death-like face - but the look faded away into one of anguish, and he murmured as before, "Mary, Mary!"

Before the threatening storms that settled darkly over our proud Capital, Madam Maryglot decamped to the city of brotherly love, Philadelphia. Ione wrote to her every week, and such letters! Pauline had sent her brother word by the safest conveyance, assuring him of the health and safety of " her prisoner," and as Mary Greenleaf was gradually restored to litght and life, all her secrets were duly forwarded to the lgrand safety fund - the capacious heart of that good lady!
