ENTEaED according to Act of Congress, in the year 1859,&#xD;

&#xD;
MY TITLE.&#xD;
" Our Mess! I am the last one left of it-I&#xD;
mean the mess of the ' Mosquito Fleet,' when&#xD;
we went to fight the Cuban pirates under&#xD;
Porter, ni 1b.ro, though I was there before&#xD;
with poor Allen, of the Alligator, who was&#xD;
killed by the black-hearted wretches."&#xD;
Thus'said one of the most distinguished&#xD;
and gallant officers of our navy to me, a few&#xD;
days ago ; and then he related some wild and&#xD;
thrilling incidents, which are the ground-work&#xD;
of this story. I'In compliment to him, and in&#xD;
memory of his brave departed mess-mates,&#xD;
this story takes its title.&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
It was evening ; and in the palace gf the&#xD;
Intendente-General of the department of Ma.&#xD;
tanzas-which overlooked the loveliest bay on&#xD;
all- the coast of Cu-ba-beauty and valor, as&#xD;
well as masked villainy, were gathered to the&#xD;
enjoyment of a festival; for it was the eve of&#xD;
the birthday of the Senorita Maraquita de&#xD;
Regla, the lovely daughter of the Intendente-&#xD;
General, the Marquis Garcia de Regla.&#xD;
Gay uniforms glittered amid the lace and&#xD;
gauze and gossamer drapery of the lovely Cu-&#xD;
ban ladies. There were Spanish, English,&#xD;
French, and American officers present. The&#xD;
latter, though evidently regarded with great&#xD;
favor by the fairer sex, seemed to be looked&#xD;
upon coldly by the Spanish officers ; and it&#xD;
was evidently a forced or constrained courtesy&#xD;
which the marquis himself tendered to them ;&#xD;
for though he had politely saluted the four&#xD;
American officers, who caiie in at an early&#xD;
hour of the evening, and whom lie had evi-&#xD;
dently met bef re-for he addressed each by&#xD;
name--- he ht     in that moment avoided&#xD;
them, and p           particular attention to&#xD;
other guests.&#xD;
With one of these-a dark and swarthy&#xD;
Spaniard, in plain citizen's dress-ho seemed&#xD;
&#xD;
to be most intimate ; and as this person is -&#xD;
one with whom we have yet much to do--&#xD;
character whose history yet lives on record, as&#xD;
well as upon the lips of tradition--he merits a&#xD;
special introduction as well as description.&#xD;
Don EnoIAnDo QuiEsrat, as he was known&#xD;
at the palace, had suddenly appeared there&#xD;
about a year before the festival-night which&#xD;
opens this story. No one but the governor&#xD;
knew who he was or where he cane from.&#xD;
The governor was alone-or, at least, his&#xD;
secretary and daughter only were with hm-&#xD;
when, unannounced, this person had walked&#xD;
into his private office, and both the daughter&#xD;
and secretary were astonished at the unusual&#xD;
agitation which the marquis exhibited at first,&#xD;
and the marked respect, even deference, which&#xD;
he showed afterward to the person whom he&#xD;
introduced to them, not as a noble, but as a&#xD;
plain senor.&#xD;
But the secretary valued his place too much&#xD;
ever to make allusion to it afterward., The&#xD;
daughter loved her father too well to wish to&#xD;
pry into his secrets ; for she, like most chil-&#xD;
dren, believed that her parent could not do&#xD;
wrong, and would not introduce to her an evil&#xD;
man. Yet then, and ever after, when Don&#xD;
Eduardo Quiestra looked at her with his black&#xD;
eye-at times as cold as ebony, and then as&#xD;
fierce as lightning lurking in the midnight-&#xD;
cloud-she trembled within her heart, and&#xD;
felt an unspoken terror.&#xD;
Dressed plainly, but riehily-a costly din-&#xD;
mond on his finger, and another in his shirt-&#xD;
bosom-standing over six feet high, with a&#xD;
forni at once elegant and muscular-a bearded&#xD;
face, the features of which were expressive of&#xD;
stern courage, but not of ferocity-and a lofty&#xD;
forehead, marked, but not disfigured, by a di-&#xD;
agonal scar as from a sabre-cut across it-this&#xD;
individual was well calculated to attract ob-&#xD;
servation, even among so many ; for he was&#xD;
unlike them  all.  In  his manners, rather&#xD;
haughty and distant, he avoided such contacts&#xD;

as he disliked-though, when he chose, he de-&#xD;
scended from his pedestal of reserve, and in&#xD;
his conversation, especially with the ladies,&#xD;
made himself very agreeable.&#xD;
There was an air of "mystery" about him&#xD;
which made him attractive in their eyes. his&#xD;
lavish expenditure of money in oceasiona&#xD;
presents to some of them, and his charity to&#xD;
the poor, proved him to be as unselfish as he&#xD;
was wealthy. But though lie sometimes care-&#xD;
lessly alluded to his country-residence, he told&#xD;
no one where it was, and if  sked, evaded the&#xD;
question. When in Matanz, s, a suite of rooms&#xD;
in the palace was assigned h mn ; when he went&#xD;
away, it was in such a man  r, and so secretly,&#xD;
that no one knew where he went. Only one&#xD;
servant attended upon his person-a young&#xD;
man of singular beauty and dignity for one in&#xD;
a menial position, whom he called Mariano,&#xD;
and whom lie treated with an almost com-&#xD;
panion-like kindness.&#xD;
Having thus introduced mihi, we will leave&#xD;
him ; and after having, for a moment, glanced&#xD;
at the loveliest gem of the evening-Maraquita&#xD;
de Regla-we will close this chapter, and hurry&#xD;
forward on our,path of romance.&#xD;
Just eighteen-which is womanhood's full&#xD;
age of development in that ripe and delicious&#xD;
clime -Maraquita possessed the oriental fea-&#xD;
tures of her Moorish descent, with the fairer&#xD;
and richer complexion of her native Castile.&#xD;
11er figure could not have been impi-oved ; it&#xD;
was faultless : for, although not so tall as some&#xD;
of the beauties tliere, it lacked in no proportion.&#xD;
l1cr expression was intellectual-soulful. She&#xD;
looked like one formed alone to love and&#xD;
to be loved. Of such a one as her the poet&#xD;
wrote :&#xD;
-"Such around her shone&#xD;
The nameless charms unmarked by her alone ;&#xD;
The light of love, the purity of grace-&#xD;
The mind-the music bi scathing from her face-&#xD;
The heart, whose softness harmonized the whole ;&#xD;
Anti oh ! that eye was in itself a soul !"&#xD;
She was very beautiful ; and so thought the&#xD;
young American lieutenant, who, having se-&#xD;
cured her not unwilling hand for the first con-&#xD;
tra-dance, was now promnenadling the handsome&#xD;
saloon with her hand upon his arnm.  nd lie,&#xD;
with his erect, manly figure, cle blue eye,&#xD;
rosy complexion, and curling b own locks,&#xD;
seemed well mated to so beautiful a creature ;&#xD;
for every step, every motion, every expression,&#xD;
proclaimed him to be what lie was-one of&#xD;
Nature's noblemen.&#xD;
And who but the God-made are noble&#xD;
Talk of blood and lineage in beasts ; but in&#xD;
mena, balh ! Where among the demagogues of&#xD;
the present day are the blood descendants of the&#xD;
incn of "'7G :"  Where, even upon European&#xD;
or Asiastic thrones, are the blood-descendants&#xD;
of lImchard Cour de Lion, Charles of Sweden&#xD;
Alexander of Russia, Tiniour the Tartar, or&#xD;
Frederick the Gient?  Or, rather, what are&#xD;
they&#xD;
h.er and anon--and Qo 'twill ever be-som&#xD;
&#xD;
ESS ; OR,&#xD;
unknown man of obscure parentage, like the&#xD;
Napoleon of Corsica, will arise, and, willed by&#xD;
the strong spirit within him, dash upward&#xD;
above all his fellow-men, to cast the 'lie into&#xD;
the faces of those who proclaim nobility as a&#xD;
heritage.            -&#xD;
CIIAPTER II.&#xD;
"'Who is tlha' young officer who, walking&#xD;
with your daughter, seems to chain her ear&#xD;
down to the accents of his tongue ?"' asked the&#xD;
Seinor Quiestra of the marquis, hvlile the lat-&#xD;
ter, with a cloud upon his brow, and half-con-&#xD;
cealed anger in his eye, glanced toward the&#xD;
couple whose description   closed our first&#xD;
chapter.&#xD;
"IIis name is Allen ; lie comnands the Amer-&#xD;
ican war-schooner in the harbor. I wish he&#xD;
were gone, for this is not the first time he has&#xD;
paid marked attentions to my child," ref lied&#xD;
the marquis, in a low tone.&#xD;
" Ihis is one of the vessels sent out by the&#xD;
Yankee government to prevent the collection&#xD;
of tribute to the black flag, is she not ?" asked&#xD;
Quiestra, while his passionless face lighted up&#xD;
for an instant with a sneering expression.&#xD;
" She is," replied the marquis.&#xD;
"Introduce me to him, and then draw your&#xD;
daughter away without arousing a suspicion&#xD;
in him that it is intentional," said Quiestra.&#xD;
Tle marquis bowed in acquiescence, and,&#xD;
accompanied by the former, moved across the&#xD;
room in a direction to intercept his daughter&#xD;
and her escort. ie did so, but only at the&#xD;
upper end of the room, as they were about to&#xD;
step out uo)0n a piazza which overlooked the&#xD;
harbor, whither Allen had invited his fair&#xD;
companion to look upon his vessel, as she lay&#xD;
upon the moonlit waters of the bay like a bird&#xD;
asleep, but ready in a moment to lift her&#xD;
wings for flight.&#xD;
Permit me to introduce my particular&#xD;
friend, Don Eduardo Quie-stra, to the notice&#xD;
of Lieutenant Allen," said the haughty mar-&#xD;
quis to the young American.&#xD;
"I am very happy to become acquainted&#xD;
with any friend of the Marquis de Regla l"&#xD;
said Allen, frankly extending his hand to the&#xD;
Spaniard.&#xD;
,    To the surprise of Maraquifa, who had no-&#xD;
ticed his habitual reserve, especially toward&#xD;
, all the foreign officers, Quiestra not only took&#xD;
f the proffered hand, but shook it warmly ; but&#xD;
she had not time to observe more, for her father,&#xD;
saying: "There is the Countess de Villalieneva,&#xD;
my child, whom we have not wtloiied," placed&#xD;
f her arm within his, and hurried heraway-lcav-&#xD;
e ing Quiestra and Alleumi   a position where&#xD;
they would necessarily be obliged to improve&#xD;
s their recent introduction.&#xD;
, i" The marquis is rather unceremonious&#xD;
r depriving me of. my late partnr in the (ane&#xD;
e said Allen, rather disappointed in the loss&#xD;
a wished-for walk and talk upon the piazza.&#xD;
e    "Perhaps he thinks that is child's warm&#xD;

THE PIRATE-HUNTS&#xD;
heart is endangered when in contact with a&#xD;
fair-haired son of the North. She is his only&#xD;
one, and we cannot blame him that lie guards&#xD;
her closely," said the Spaniard, speaking in a&#xD;
careless tone, and ev'incing no interest in the&#xD;
matter by any expression of his face.&#xD;
"I never would wrong her noble heart,"&#xD;
said Allen, quickly. "lIle need never guard&#xD;
her from me, for 1 would lose a life in her de-&#xD;
fence, or for hqr honor !"&#xD;
"A h ! you love her,,then ?"&#xD;
Quiestra said this in such a cold, utterly&#xD;
passionless, and disinterested tone, that Allen,&#xD;
naturally ingenuous and confiding, thought&#xD;
not of duplicity or a danger of betrayal, and&#xD;
he said :&#xD;
"Yes, with all my heart !"&#xD;
"And is your love returned ?"&#xD;
The Spaniard asked this question in such a&#xD;
way that Allen began to be upon his guard.&#xD;
IIe replied&#xD;
"I have already said too much upon this&#xD;
subject to z stranger-more than I should&#xD;
done."&#xD;
You have said so much," replied Quiestra,&#xD;
in a quiet way, "that to reply to my question&#xD;
will not add to your error, if you have erred.&#xD;
A confidence should never be halved."&#xD;
"In this case it must be," said Allen, ab-&#xD;
ruptly.,&#xD;
For a second-not a second, a breath's time&#xD;
only-fire flashed in the Spaniard's black eye,&#xD;
but the next instant it was as calm and cold&#xD;
as before.&#xD;
"As you will," he said, lsindly. . "I have&#xD;
no right, as a stranger, to intrude myself upon&#xD;
your confidence : nor, perhaps, should I offer&#xD;
a friendship which might be usefulin promot-&#xD;
ing your future happiness ; for I, 'elieve that&#xD;
few men have more influence with the Marquis&#xD;
de Regla than myself."&#xD;
"Forgive me; I am over-cautious perhaps.&#xD;
But this is a delicate matter ; only-the lady&#xD;
and yourself are aware of my attachment,"&#xD;
said Allen, again grasping the hand of the&#xD;
Spaiiard. " I will not withhold my full' con-&#xD;
fidehee from you. The lady does return my&#xD;
affection ; but'she fears her father's anger, and&#xD;
will not permit ine to make known to him my&#xD;
feelings and wishes, as I desire."&#xD;
"She is right, and possesses more sense and&#xD;
prudence than most of her sex. 11er father is&#xD;
a strange man, and must be approached with&#xD;
caution and in accordance to his natures But&#xD;
let us walk upon the piazza; there ire too&#xD;
many Estening ears around us here."&#xD;
Arm in arm, as if they had been t vo old&#xD;
friends, these utter opposites in looks and na-&#xD;
ture passed from the saloon to the piazza, to&#xD;
the wonder of more than one whq knew Qui-&#xD;
estra, and had never before seen(hiin touch&#xD;
the arm or hand of a male acquaintance, or&#xD;
descend from the icy throne of his reserve.&#xD;

ERS OF TIE GULF.                         d&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
"Botheration to ye, should on ! Should on,&#xD;
I say, and I'll have the ivory adrift before ye&#xD;
can toss off a glass o' grog!"&#xD;
Reader, permit me to introduce to your no-&#xD;
tice, Surgeon Florence O'Shaughnessy, of the&#xD;
U. S. schooner Alligator, a gentleman with all&#xD;
the " rich brogue of Erin" rolling off his&#xD;
tongue, yet claiming, and rightfully, to-be an&#xD;
American-born citizen, for he was born under&#xD;
the American flag, while his father was Amer-&#xD;
ican Consul at Dublin.&#xD;
The doctor's height was not less than six&#xD;
feet, yet unless he stood by the side of another&#xD;
person, you would think him very short, he&#xD;
was so fat. His body was built much like a&#xD;
rum-puncheon, and its capacity for acting as&#xD;
one, was very frequently tested by the doctor.&#xD;
His head was very small, and his legs were not&#xD;
of a size to correspond with his trunk, in fact&#xD;
they looked too frail to support such a weight&#xD;
above. In truth, put a small pumpkin on top of&#xD;
a cask, putty on a pug nose, cut a wide mouth,&#xD;
and stick a few bristles on the top for hair,&#xD;
punching two small holes for eyes, and then&#xD;
put two broomsticks beneathfor'legs, and you&#xD;
will have a very tolerable representation of&#xD;
Doctor O'Shaughnessy.&#xD;
His particular occupation at the moment&#xD;
when we introduce him to the reader was that&#xD;
of extracting a tooth from the mouth of the&#xD;
negro cook of the schooner. He had got his&#xD;
turn-key upon the grinder, and his assistant,&#xD;
the medical steward of the vessel, was holding&#xD;
back the negrd's head by the wool, while the&#xD;
doctor, with both hands griping the handle of&#xD;
the instrument and his feet firmly set against&#xD;
the carriage of the gun on which lhe had seat-&#xD;
ed the " subject of operation,'' was pulling&#xD;
with a vigor which made it certaiiI that some-&#xD;
thing must come up by the roots-either wool&#xD;
or ivory. The negro, with both hands set&#xD;
against the doctor's protuberant abdomen, was&#xD;
involuntarily assisting in the operation, while&#xD;
his eyes rolled in agony, and his face assumed&#xD;
a bluish hue, with the pain of the toothache,&#xD;
and this additional infliction.&#xD;
As the doctor gave an additional jerk when&#xD;
he cried out shouldd on," the obstinate tooth&#xD;
gave way, and the doctor's body went with it;&#xD;
and his next position was horizontal, so far as&#xD;
his body was concerned. But his legs flour-&#xD;
ished in the air, and his long right arm was&#xD;
raised with the instrument and the to th in&#xD;
token of triumph ; while the freed neg' , u'u-&#xD;
ing a yell of mingled delight and pain, rushed&#xD;
away toward the galley, fully determined never&#xD;
to have the toothache again on board of that&#xD;
vessel.&#xD;
Assisted by the steward, the doctor regained&#xD;
his feet in a moment, and as he regarded the&#xD;
tooth, or rather tusk, which he held, he said&#xD;
"Be jabers, 'tis no wonderit pulled so hard !&#xD;
It has roots like an ould oak. The next one I&#xD;

mannedl I've exhausted myself entirely, P1l1&#xD;
have to take some of my own medicine !"&#xD;
By way of explanation, we must state that&#xD;
the doctor s principal rule of practice was con-&#xD;
fined to what he called the three great " Bs"&#xD;
.Bleceling, l)listeri n g, and brandy.&#xD;
In this case, bi-andy was the medicine which&#xD;
Le considered necessary, and he took a dose as&#xD;
soon as possible.&#xD;
CIIAPTER IV.&#xD;
When Lieutenant Allen and the Spaniard&#xD;
3tepped1 out upon the piazza, a lovely scene&#xD;
greeted their eyes. Directly beneath their&#xD;
feet was the beautiful garden of the palace,&#xD;
teeming with flowers and fruits, all glittering&#xD;
in the golden moonlight, or mellowing off iito&#xD;
the shadows of the trees-but beyond lay the&#xD;
ay, rippling like dancing silver in the wind&#xD;
and moonlight. Several large vessels of war&#xD;
lay in the anchorageusually allotted to vessels&#xD;
of that class, and nearer in toward the town&#xD;
were a few merchantmen of different rigs. But&#xD;
by far the prettiest of all, was the taut and&#xD;
rakish little schooner of which Allen was the'&#xD;
commander. IIer black hull was long, sharp&#xD;
fore and aft, yet of great breadth of beam at&#xD;
and just abaft the fore-rigging ; it lay low in the&#xD;
water, and up above it rose spars calculated to&#xD;
spread an immensity of canvas. Though she&#xD;
was a half mile off, the moon glittering upon&#xD;
her brass eighteen-pounder amidships, and her&#xD;
six carronades of a side, enabled the Spaniard&#xD;
at a glance to note her armament.&#xD;
I need not ask which is your vessel !"&#xD;
said Quiestra to Allen.   " None but your&#xD;
countrymen can build or rig a vessel like&#xD;
that !" and he pointed to the schooner.&#xD;
Allen was gratified with the compliment, for&#xD;
he not only felt a sailor's pride in the vessel&#xD;
which he commanded, but also an honest and&#xD;
 patriotic emulation in the country which he&#xD;
served.'&#xD;
SIs your schooner very fast?" asked the&#xD;
Spaniard.&#xD;
"She has never been beaten, except by one&#xD;
vessel, the Pilot, of New York, built by the&#xD;
same man, a vessel of the same size and rig.&#xD;
She can beat us slightly off the wind, we are&#xD;
her match when close hauled !"&#xD;
"Indeed! Is that vessel in your Government&#xD;
service, also ?"&#xD;
"No, sir-she was purchased for the Mexi-&#xD;
can p;rin ateer service, just before we sailed, and&#xD;
i probably on her way to Vera Cruz, by this&#xD;
time, under American colors, there to assume&#xD;
Mexican. As her captain intendyl to stop&#xD;
either at Key West or Havana, on his way&#xD;
out, we directed him to bring out our letters !"&#xD;
I should like to see her! I have a passion&#xD;
for beautiful vessels. You wuld hardly think&#xD;
so by my dress and nppearance ; but I am a&#xD;
savor myself or was in my younger days'"&#xD;
&#xD;
ESS; U.R,l&#xD;
"I had a suspicion that yen hac tasted salt&#xD;
water-perhaps you have seen service !" and&#xD;
Allen glanced at the scar upon the Spaiard's&#xD;
brow..&#xD;
"Sonic in my younger. days !" and a grim&#xD;
smile lighted up the face of tha speaker. " If&#xD;
I am informed rightly of your object in these&#xD;
waters, you are likely to see active service !"&#xD;
said he, in continuation.&#xD;
I hope so !" said Allen, enthusiastically&#xD;
"I would give three years' pay to lay yard-&#xD;
arm and yard-arm with, or to stand upon the&#xD;
same deek with COLCEFRINAS, the Terror of the&#xD;
Gulf !"&#xD;
A dark flush ran over the face of the Span-&#xD;
iard, and his great eyes again flashed for an&#xD;
instant like those of a fierce animal about to&#xD;
spring into battle ; but Allen was'looking at his&#xD;
vessel, and did not observe the agitation which&#xD;
the Spaniard exhibited, though it lasted only&#xD;
an instant. When it passed away, he said:&#xD;
"Your ambition is but natural, yet were you&#xD;
to meet this redoubtable chief, you might find&#xD;
yourself overmatched. I have heard much of&#xD;
him of late years. But why do you single him&#xD;
out of so many piratical leaders? There is&#xD;
Domingo, almost as famous as he; Velasqusa e&#xD;
and others !'&#xD;
" Ibeeause he is the acknowledged leader of&#xD;
them all-the bravest-the most ferocious ! '&#xD;
"Ferocity and bravery do not go togeth ,r,&#xD;
young man !" said the Spaniard. "This Ccl-&#xD;
cefrinas, if the report of his enemies be true,&#xD;
possesses courage without cruelty, and even&#xD;
though lie claims a right to exact tribute from&#xD;
all who cross his path, he never sheds blood, I&#xD;
have heard, except in cases of resistance !"&#xD;
"That may be so ; yet, nevertheless, he is a&#xD;
pirate-his hand is raised against every flug,&#xD;
and we are bound to destroy him !"&#xD;
"If you can catch him !" and again that&#xD;
shadowy smile came out upon the Spaniard's&#xD;
face. And his tone was so sarcastic when ho&#xD;
spoke, that Allen, who had been looking over&#xD;
the water, turned to catch the expression of his&#xD;
face. But it was now as calm as when he made&#xD;
his introductory bow.&#xD;
"Are you well acquainted with the-coast of&#xD;
this island ?" asked Allen.&#xD;
"As well as one can be who from his child-&#xD;
hood has been reared upon its shores. There&#xD;
is se~'ce a bay or inlet that I have not visited&#xD;
at one time or another !" ,&#xD;
"I wish that I knew so much of the coast.&#xD;
Our charts are imperfect-only the larger in.&#xD;
dentations of the coast are down, and the very&#xD;
spots which pirates would seek for hiding-&#xD;
places are omitted. We work in the dark !"&#xD;
"Being after dark men, perhaps it is best !"&#xD;
and again the Spaniard smiled. "When will&#xD;
you sail. ?'l he asked in continuation.&#xD;
" As soon as either of the vessels appointed&#xD;
to act in concert with me arrive !"&#xD;
I should like much to take a cruise wit&#xD;
you in search of that Colcefrinas ! I sho&#xD;

"I a k no better fortune than that !" replied&#xD;
Allen. "But if you are serious in your desire&#xD;
to take a cruise in the Alligator, as my guest,&#xD;
you will be very welcome."&#xD;
"A thousand thanks ! I have some business&#xD;
which calls me to my estate at an early hour&#xD;
in the morning, and must go there. But if&#xD;
you do not sail before I return, count upon&#xD;
me as'making one at your table on your next&#xD;
cruise. And now we will return to the saloon.&#xD;
I will so manage, that you will have an hour's&#xD;
converse with the fair M araquita, without in-&#xD;
terruption from either her father or that vine-&#xD;
gar-faced old aunt of hers !"&#xD;
"Oh, thank you, my kind friend-thank&#xD;
you a thousand times! Excuse the unjust&#xD;
suspicions which made me for a moment hesi-&#xD;
tate to bestow my full confidence upon you!"&#xD;
Arm in arm, as they had gone forth, the&#xD;
two gentlemen now re-entered the saloon.&#xD;
Maraquita, surrounded by a group of admirers,&#xD;
but still resting upon her father's arm, was&#xD;
near, and to her Quiestra at once led the way.&#xD;
"Marquis, I have a word to say to you in&#xD;
private ; be so good as to leave your daughter&#xD;
:n the care of this gallant officer, who will&#xD;
doubtless keep all pirates at a distance from&#xD;
sq fair a prize, and retire with me for a few&#xD;
moments," said the Spaniard, to the father of&#xD;
Maraquita.&#xD;
The marquis looked astonished, seeming&#xD;
hardly to understand the words of Quiestra ;&#xD;
but at a look from the latter, which command,&#xD;
ed rather than asked, he dropped the arm of&#xD;
his daughter, which, with his implied consent-j&#xD;
was instantly placed in that of Allen, and tak-&#xD;
ing the arm of-Quiestra, he accompanied that&#xD;
mysterious person back to the piazza, which&#xD;
he had so lately occupied with Allen.&#xD;
"What does this mean, senor-you surely&#xD;
do not wish to forego your claim on Maraqui-&#xD;
ta's hand, in favor of this audacious North&#xD;
American ?" cried the marquis to Quiestra, the&#xD;
moment that they were alone.&#xD;
"Not for an instant, my dear marquis," re-&#xD;
plied the latter, blandy. "But I have got to&#xD;
heat this Yankee at his game, and must use&#xD;
himself to do it. You know his errand to this&#xD;
coast, and what its success will cost both.you&#xD;
and me. I have already wormed myself into his&#xD;
confidence, and that which I have just done&#xD;
will add to .'my power with him. He loves&#xD;
your daughter and she loves him-the fool&#xD;
told me so !"&#xD;
"Mid malediciones! I will shut her up in a&#xD;
dungeon!"&#xD;
"You will do no such thing. It is too late&#xD;
to either starve, or chill, or frighten the love&#xD;
out of her heart. But I care not for that !&#xD;
When she is my wife, 'll draw the reins tight-&#xD;
r; at present, like a decoy, she must be used&#xD;
 blind him to our work, and to lure him to&#xD;
point where I shall decide that he stops,&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
'     I&#xD;
&#xD;
and stops forever ! DI shall plan all this work.&#xD;
Garcia de Regla, I only ask you to execute and&#xD;
obey ! Remember the past-had it not been&#xD;
for, me you would not be what you are now--&#xD;
only by my aid can you reach the post you&#xD;
desire, and  become  Governor-General of&#xD;
Cuba !"&#xD;
"Do not speak of the past !" said the Mar-&#xD;
quis ; and he shuddered and closed his eyes, as&#xD;
if he wished to shut out some terrible vision.&#xD;
"I will not, if you do a man's duty for the&#xD;
present. Now listen to me. I leave for the&#xD;
rendezvous in an hour.' There is a schooner&#xD;
on her way out from the north which I must&#xD;
capture, for she can out-sail the fastest one in&#xD;
their fleet-which this young Yankee com-&#xD;
mands. Use every means, except open force,&#xD;
to keep him from going to sea before I return ;&#xD;
for I intend to come back and go to sea on a&#xD;
cruise with him, as a friend and pilot. Ho&#xD;
wants to-see Colcefrinas, and he shalt see him!"&#xD;
"Madre de Dios ! You will not place yoi ur-&#xD;
self in his power ?"&#xD;
"No-I shall not be in his power. I a- a,&#xD;
with him, only your friend, Don Eduar 1o&#xD;
Quiestra-not-"&#xD;
"Breathe not your name here, for Heavei's&#xD;
sake, capitano mio !" said the Marquis, wi ch&#xD;
anxiety and haste.&#xD;
"Don't terrify yourself-I shall not. B it&#xD;
mark my words, and obey my directions ivii-&#xD;
plicitly. If you permit this Yankee free a-&#xD;
cess to visit your daughter while I am gore,&#xD;
he is so much in love, that he will forget his&#xD;
duty, and linger longer' ththi lie would do ofh-&#xD;
erwise. See that'it is done 1"&#xD;
"But senor, such freedom may prove har&#xD;
ruin; she has warm blood in her veins, esd&#xD;
he-"&#xD;
"Is so chivalrous that he is honQrabls.&#xD;
Though I hate him, I would trust' him with&#xD;
her if she were my wife ! Have no fears, but&#xD;
obey. I shall leave in an hour.. Mariano will&#xD;
remain here -and aid you. If anything espe-&#xD;
cial occurs before I return, send him to me !"&#xD;
. "Do you not trust that youth too far ?"&#xD;
asked the marquis.&#xD;
"Have you ever seen a look or heard from&#xD;
his lips a word that would tend toward my&#xD;
betrayal ?"&#xD;
"No, senor."&#xD;
"Then I do not trust him too far. But now&#xD;
let 1s return to the saloon; and Iwill go away&#xD;
as soon as I can do so unobserved !"&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
A half hour later, while ' the music of&#xD;
the festival came faintly upon his ear, Quiestra&#xD;
stood in the chamber which was always as-&#xD;
signed to him when lie visited the palace.&#xD;
His dress was not now the plain, peaceful cit-&#xD;
ien's garb, which he had worn in the salqo&#xD;
of the Intendente General. He wore a close-&#xD;
fitting shirt of mail, whie  completely pro.&#xD;
tected his person, from his neck to his hips.&#xD;

Over this he drew a loose frbck, or blouse of&#xD;
embroidered velvet, and buckling a belt&#xD;
around him, to which a short, curved sabre&#xD;
was attached, placed in it a brace of gold-&#xD;
mounted, long-barreled pistols, an  a long,&#xD;
broad-bladed dagger. Upon his he 'dhe wore&#xD;
a close-fitting cap, while the nether 1"mubs were&#xD;
almost concealed by a pair of heavy-looking,&#xD;
but really light turkey-leather boots, which&#xD;
eamo considerably above the knee.&#xD;
Upon a chair close by hung a large sea-&#xD;
cloak, adapted to concealing the person, as&#xD;
well as to protect it from what is seldom&#xD;
known in that country, inclement weather.&#xD;
Before him stood the valet, or page we&#xD;
might call him, to whom we have alluded once&#xD;
or twice before. lie was not tall for one of&#xD;
his sex; in figure rather slight, but even&#xD;
more elegantly proportioned than his master.&#xD;
His features were exquisitely classical ; his&#xD;
complexion so rich and transparent that the&#xD;
mantling blood seemed ready to come through&#xD;
the skin when lie blushed, as he almo inva-&#xD;
riably did when his master spoke t   him.&#xD;
His great black eyes were shaded by long,&#xD;
silken lashes,.and about his temples, over his&#xD;
white brow, and clear down to his shoulders,&#xD;
hung masses of curling hair, as black and as&#xD;
soft as the down on the raven's breast. His&#xD;
dress was neat and tasty, a tunic buttoning or&#xD;
rather lacing with loops across his chest and&#xD;
up to his neck-loose trowsers below, and a&#xD;
noroceo slipper fitting on a foot small enough&#xD;
to have belonged to a woman. lie seemed&#xD;
young, not more than seventeen or eighteen&#xD;
years old.&#xD;
"Mariano, my good lad, I an going to pay&#xD;
a brief visit to our rendezvous, and~perhaps to&#xD;
take a little fresh pir on blue water. But I&#xD;
'shall not take you with me this time !"&#xD;
A look of pain and disappointment express-&#xD;
ed the feelings of the young'man, but he said&#xD;
nothing.&#xD;
"My absence will be very brief," continued&#xD;
:lhe Spaniard, " and it is my wish, that with-&#xD;
c-ut appearing to notice anything that goes on&#xD;
mn the palace, you note everything : particu-&#xD;
larly nwrk the movements of the lady Mara-&#xD;
quita and the young American officer, who&#xD;
ommnands the schooner in the harbor. Should&#xD;
their folly reach'so far asto look like an inten-&#xD;
tion of elopement or clandestine marriage, see&#xD;
that it is prevented."&#xD;
"Will my master take offence if I ask him&#xD;
a question ?" asked Mariano, in a low voice&#xD;
fulf of music.&#xD;
"No, my good lad-you know that it takes&#xD;
much to make me angry with you!"&#xD;
Does the senor, my master, ever intend to&#xD;
marry the lady Maraquita liimself?"&#xD;
Not while your mother lives, my boy ! I&#xD;
would not be unjust to\ hIier, nor break herc&#xD;
heart. She is rmy queen, and shall be while&#xD;
the lives ! lh'r,' wiiV do you blush and trem-&#xD;
m..so?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Trr" err&#xD;
&#xD;
ESS ; OR,&#xD;
"Anxiety for my mother, seilor-nothing&#xD;
more," replied the young man.&#xD;
"You need have no fears, then. But take&#xD;
the heed I bade you. This American is sent,&#xD;
with many others, to hunt out and destroy&#xD;
the free rovers of the sea; and we must out-&#xD;
wit him. lie deems me a friend ; if he ques-&#xD;
tions you, your ready wit will frame proper&#xD;
'replies. I have gone to my estate in the&#xD;
country : you comprehend me ?"&#xD;
"Yes, my master."&#xD;
"It is enough, then. Good night. I have&#xD;
leagues to pass over before the day'dawns."&#xD;
The young man took the Spaniard's extend-&#xD;
ed hand, kissed it reverently, and then helped&#xD;
to put the cloak upon his form. A moment&#xD;
later, Quiestra had departed, and he was alone.&#xD;
Then Mariano, with a deep sigh, sat down,&#xD;
and, hiding his face with his hands, seemed to&#xD;
lose himself in sad thoughts.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
Along the shores of the Queen of the An-&#xD;
tilles may be found many a lovely bay ; many&#xD;
"a pretty little river gushes out through her&#xD;
flower-covered cliffs into the deep-blue of the&#xD;
Guff Stream. Yet among all of these there is&#xD;
no spot so beautiful as that which I am about&#xD;
to describe.                     -&#xD;
About twelve or fifteen leagues east of Car-&#xD;
denas, there is an extended line of small&#xD;
islands-all of them very lovely-which seem&#xD;
tg stand as outposts between the gulf and&#xD;
shore. About midway of this group, urhere&#xD;
the rocky cliffs of the mainland rise dark and&#xD;
frowning, a passage has been'pierced by the&#xD;
hand of Nature through the stern barrier-&#xD;
which is invisble until one is close upon it-,&#xD;
and by one unacquainted with it would be&#xD;
passed unobserved at a cable's length. It. is&#xD;
narrow-so narrow that'no square-'igged ves-&#xD;
sel' could enter without having her yards&#xD;
cock-billed,; and the most careful hand at the&#xD;
helm would have all that he could do to pick&#xD;
his way in through the tortuous channel be-&#xD;
tween the lofty cliffs. But, once in, a bay&#xD;
large enough to anchor fifty ships-of-the-line&#xD;
would meet his eye-a bay bordered all around&#xD;
by a snow-white beach of sand, to the very&#xD;
edge of which a vessel could be laid. So en-&#xD;
tirely land-locked is this bay, that not a pulse&#xD;
of-the ocean-surges from outside could wake a&#xD;
wave upon its breast. A cresdent-shaped pla-&#xD;
teau of level land stretches the width of a half&#xD;
mde back from the bay ; and all around in&#xD;
the rear of this, lofty and apparently inaccess-&#xD;
ible hills form the background.&#xD;
Upon this plateau-much of which is under,&#xD;
cultivation, ind teems with the various luxu-&#xD;
riant productions of the tropie --are many&#xD;
little houses, built of cane, and thatched with&#xD;
the broad leaves of the palm. In the midst&#xD;
of these, and facing the narrow entrance to the&#xD;
bay, is one of larger size and greater are&#xD;
textural pretensions-for it boasts of a cer'&#xD;

THE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF TIE GULF.&#xD;
&#xD;
dah, a, cupola-rotem in which- to enjoy the&#xD;
balmy evening air-and in its finish is more&#xD;
perfect than the others. And before it is a&#xD;
mounted battery of six long eighteen-pounder&#xD;
cannon, so leveled as to sweep the entrance to&#xD;
the bay. All over this plateau, and among&#xD;
the cottages, women and men are walking in&#xD;
company, and little children are seen at play.&#xD;
In the bay, lying moored to the shore, are&#xD;
three armed vessels-two schooners and a&#xD;
sloop-while a vast number of cast-rowing&#xD;
boats are drawn up on the beach, with their&#xD;
oars and boat-hooks stacked near them, ready&#xD;
for use. Not a flag to denote the nation or&#xD;
calling of these people could be seen. But&#xD;
that it was peab3eful, was doubtful ; for nearly&#xD;
every man wore weapons in his belt, and&#xD;
seemed prepared to do martial service at a&#xD;
moment's notice.            '&#xD;
It is the morning of the second day since&#xD;
the festival of the birthday of Maraquita de&#xD;
Regla. We will for a moment look within the&#xD;
larger house upon the plateau which we have&#xD;
described. It is magnificently furnished, and&#xD;
in its draperies, hangings, mirrors, carpets, so-&#xD;
fas, ottomans, chairs, and tables, it would seem&#xD;
that the art and industry of all nations had&#xD;
shared ; for they were as various as they were&#xD;
rich and costly. From the style of many of&#xD;
the paintings, and the nature of some of the&#xD;
gold and silver plate which was almost strew-&#xD;
ed around (it appeared so profusely), it would&#xD;
seem that churches had helped to adorn this&#xD;
most singular and palace-like dwelling.&#xD;
But of yet another ornament we must now&#xD;
take note. In an apartment whose large win-&#xD;
dows, opening from the floor to the ceiling&#xD;
above, looked out on the bay in front, and on&#xD;
the northern side toward the mountains in the&#xD;
northeast, a lady stood, leaning with a listless&#xD;
air against a marble statue, the form of which&#xD;
did not see'ni more perfect than her own. It&#xD;
was of the " Medician" height-five feet six&#xD;
inches ; yet shc was at least two inches taller,&#xD;
perfect in every proportion. 1Her age was&#xD;
fully thirty-five ; yet her face possessed all&#xD;
the freshness of youth. Her great black eyes&#xD;
flashed with the fire and passion of sixteen,&#xD;
and not a thread of silver could be seen amid&#xD;
the great masses of black, glossy hair which&#xD;
curled down aboat her white neck and ehoul-&#xD;
ders. 11er expression was one of majestic dig-&#xD;
nity. She seemed as if she had been used to&#xD;
exact and command reverence and respect&#xD;
from all who approached her. Yet there was&#xD;
a voluptu''s and dreamy look that told that&#xD;
love could find--probably had found-a home&#xD;
a        in the depths of.her nature.&#xD;
-           The sound of a bugle from the mountain-top&#xD;
to the north-east reached her ear, and pro-&#xD;
duced an instant change in her appearance.&#xD;
IIer eyes flashed, and her countenance lighted&#xD;
up with a look of joy.&#xD;
It is Eluardo !" she murmured ; and tak-&#xD;
ing a gold-monuntod telescope from a table&#xD;
&#xD;
close at hand, she raised it in the direction&#xD;
from whence the sound came ; and a look of&#xD;
disappointment flitted over he' face as she&#xD;
looked, and she said : "lie comes alone ; my&#xD;
chlil { is not there ! What can it mean ! O&#xD;
IIea yen ! should he suspect the truth, and-"&#xD;
She did not finish her remark ; for a man,&#xD;
armed and dressed with some insignia which&#xD;
betokened him to be an officer, entered.&#xD;
"The captain is coming, senora," said he.&#xD;
"Yes, Pablo ; I heard his bugle. Raise his&#xD;
colors on the flagstaff."&#xD;
The man bowed and retired. A few mo.&#xD;
ments later, a black flag, with two crimson&#xD;
swords crossed in its centre, and the name so&#xD;
dreaded in all the southern waters--" CoLcE-&#xD;
raINAs"-embroidered in letters of gold be-&#xD;
neath them, was hoisted from a staff near the&#xD;
battery in front of the house ; and,- as soon as&#xD;
this was done, a similar flag floated from each&#xD;
of the vessels in the harbor, and the men from&#xD;
every direction hastened to the plateauin front&#xD;
of the flagstaff, and there formed in military&#xD;
order to receive their chief, who could noW&#xD;
be plainly seen descending the mountain-side&#xD;
with rapid footsteps.&#xD;
They were a wild, rough-looking gang, arm.&#xD;
ed each to suit his taste, and, dressed in such&#xD;
garbs as suited their will and convenience.&#xD;
They were, judging from their looks, desper-&#xD;
ate and hardened -men, culled out from al-&#xD;
most every nation. There was the swarthy&#xD;
Spaniard, the sallow Frenchman, the yellow&#xD;
Portuguese, the florid Anglo-Saxon, and the&#xD;
olive-hued Creole.&#xD;
4s the-chief, who was none other than hirrm&#xD;
whom we have known as Quiestrh, approached,&#xD;
the murmur of many voices which had fi i&#xD;
the air, ceased, and all was silent when 'he&#xD;
stepped in front of- the line, and replied to the&#xD;
salute given by Pablo de Canova, his second&#xD;
in command.&#xD;
"Send the crews on board the vessels in-&#xD;
stantly, Pablo, and be ready to start on a&#xD;
cruise in an hour! I go with you myself."&#xD;
These were the only words uttered by Colce-&#xD;
frinas. These spoken, he turned away as ha ugh-&#xD;
tily as he had come, and entered the house.&#xD;
The instant that he had crossed the thresh.&#xD;
old, a pair of round, white arms were thrown&#xD;
about his neck, red, ripe lips 'were pressed&#xD;
burningly to hIs own, and the fair woman,&#xD;
whom we have so lately briefly described,&#xD;
murmured:&#xD;
"Eduardo! Amer mio ! I am      se happy&#xD;
that you have come again&#xD;
"I am glad to see you, my Menona ' he an-&#xD;
swered, far more coldly than her caresses&#xD;
seemed to merit. "ButI have little tme new&#xD;
for acts or words of endearment. I have hur-&#xD;
ried hither for a purpose which I must speed-&#xD;
ily accomplish. I must put to sea to try and&#xD;

You have a kimigdoi's wealth in your posses-&#xD;

Why not lower your fag forever, and do as&#xD;

Colcefrinas is unknown-where you have never&#xD;

rank, which your gold can buy, and my love,&#xD;
which only death can chill, be happy !"&#xD;
"What, Monona?    Do my ears hear you ad-&#xD;
vise me to bend the knee to the dogs of a na-&#xD;

of existence-me, ayson of old Castile !"&#xD;

Island itself; and if Spain yields not to the beg-&#xD;
gal's, they'll take it ! They need a lesson, and&#xD;
Colcefriiias shall he their teacher !''&#xD;
The woman sail no more, but a mournful&#xD;
expression looked from her great, black eyes.&#xD;
Where is Mariano ?" she asked, after a&#xD;
brief pause.&#xD;
"I left him behind, at Matanzas, to watch&#xD;
the movements of some American officers&#xD;
there, who are awaiting more vessels before&#xD;
they coie in search of nc."&#xD;
" Will he not be in danger ? You promised&#xD;
me, when I first consented that lie should act&#xD;
as your page and servant, never to let him&#xD;
leave your side."&#xD;
lie is as safe, yes,  ore free from peril be-&#xD;
r.eath the roof of Garcia de Regla, than he&#xD;
would be here : for here, if the Americans&#xD;
(sectver my place of rendezvous, blood will&#xD;
run like water. To give them their due, we&#xD;

than men. for they won their liberty against&#xD;
terrible disadvantages ! But all their navy&#xD;
cannot eonle ir me here, if there is no treach-&#xD;
ery beieatli my o.wn -flag !"&#xD;
The woman said no more, although her&#xD;
looks told that she was far from being happy&#xD;
nmw. Colcefrimas noticed this, and in a kinder&#xD;
tone. said .&#xD;
" Cheer ~p. Menona mic-cheer up ! Bring&#xD;
mne some wine. I am tired. and will ledge love&#xD;

Sh'e hurried into 'another apartment, and&#xD;

ESS ; OR,&#xD;
"My lord, my life, your 'health and our um&#xD;
dying love !" she said, and she raised She cup&#xD;
to her lips and drank, while the blood' in her&#xD;
cheek, as if emulous of the color of the wine,&#xD;
flushed deeper and brighter. For it had been&#xD;
rare of late that his arm had pressed her form,&#xD;
and now its touch gave new life into her heart.&#xD;
hIe took the cup from her and drained it to&#xD;
the bottom ; then tossing it carelessly aside,&#xD;
drew her down upon her knee, and kissed her&#xD;
white brow. With a low cry of gladness, such&#xD;
as a yoi~ng child utters when the mother&#xD;
comes, for which it has been weeping, she&#xD;
threw her arms about his neck, and while the&#xD;
tears of gladness trickled down the rosy path-&#xD;
way of her cheeks, she gave him a hundred&#xD;
kisses on his lips, and e5es, and broad, high&#xD;
forehead. This joy lasted but for a few mo-&#xD;
ments; for as he glanced toward his vessels in&#xD;
the bay, lie saw that their sails were loosed,&#xD;
and he sprang to his feet.&#xD;
"When will my Eduardo come back ?"&#xD;
asked the lady.       '&#xD;
" When lie has succeeded in his enterprise !"&#xD;
replied the pirate, quietly. " Meantime, let&#xD;
my brave Monona prove herself competent to&#xD;
guard her home and my treasures. 1h11e look-&#xD;
outs on, the mountains must be vigilantly&#xD;
maintained-those on the islands be on the&#xD;
watch night and day, Should our foes, by any&#xD;
fatal error on our part, or any good fortune&#xD;
of their own, discover the entrance to the bay,&#xD;
the battery nust tell their doom. Should&#xD;
they enter, let the hidden mines be fired, while&#xD;
,you seek safety in the cave known only to&#xD;
you, myself, and Mariano. I know my Mono-&#xD;
na will do all this !"&#xD;
" With God's help I will !" she responded ;&#xD;
and she crossed herself, as if the actions con-&#xD;
templated were such as God would bless.&#xD;
Again lie pressed a kiss upon her brow, and&#xD;
turning upon his heel, departed.&#xD;
She watched him until lie reached the beach,&#xD;
where he launched a light shell of a boat of&#xD;
peculiar construction. sharp at both ends and&#xD;
decked ever (like the canoe of an Eequimaux)&#xD;
except where the rower must sit. Into this&#xD;
lie sprang, and soon placed himself alongside&#xD;
of the largest of the schooners.&#xD;
Springing on board, he left the little boat&#xD;
to drift in toward the shore or be picked up&#xD;
l'y some of the men there, and at once gave&#xD;
such orders, that in a few moments all three&#xD;
of the vessels were under sail and slowly work&#xD;
ing out of the harbor.&#xD;
CIIATER VI.&#xD;
"What a singular influence this Seior Quies-&#xD;
tr. seems to possess ever your father !" said&#xD;
Allen to Maraeuita de Retla, as -soon as they&#xD;
had moved to a place where they could con,&#xD;
; erse without being overheard. on the night of&#xD;
her festival, when the Spaniard. known as&#xD;
Quieetra, had withdrawn the marquis from&#xD;
them.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PIRATE-HUNT&#xD;
&#xD;
"it is more singular that he should exert&#xD;
this influence to favor you !" said the young&#xD;
lady. 't Although lie has not yet himself di-&#xD;
rectly pruoposed'lmarriage to mie-for lie knows&#xD;
that I hate him-he not only has made such a&#xD;
proposition to my father, but I fear has either&#xD;
gained the consent of the latter to the step by&#xD;
his will, or by this same mysterious influence,&#xD;
forced it from him. More than once has my&#xD;
father hinted that I am to become his wife !"&#xD;
And will you ?" asked the young Ameri-&#xD;
can, in a low, sad tone, as lie fixed his eyes&#xD;
upon hers.&#xD;
" Will I ?" she responded-and the hot&#xD;
blood rushed in a flood up through her veined&#xD;
cheeks, until, her very brow was all aglo,w-&#xD;
"wll I?  Not from your lips-not from your&#xD;
heart s'iould come that question! No, no ! a&#xD;
thousand times No ! Sooner, far sooner, would&#xD;
be the bride of Death ! IIe is-I am sure lie&#xD;
is a-"&#xD;
She paused, trembled, and turned as pale as&#xD;
death ; for close before her, looking at her&#xD;
with flashing, threatening eyes, stood young&#xD;
Mariano. She (lid not finish the sentence she&#xD;
had commenced, but turned away ; for the eyes&#xD;
of the strange youth seemed to cast a spell&#xD;
upon her tongue, and to chain he' will to si-&#xD;
lence:         -&#xD;
Allen had not noticed the youth, for he&#xD;
came and passed like a shadow;~and he asked:&#xD;
"What were you about to say, dear Mara-&#xD;
quita ? What is this strange man ?"&#xD;
" My filther's friend, and, as you say, a&#xD;
strange man !" said the lovely girl ; and she&#xD;
still trembled, for she scemcd to'feel that she&#xD;
had been on the verge of endangering her&#xD;
father, by the exposure of some secret.&#xD;
Let us go and join in the dance again !"&#xD;
she said, seeming to wish to be placed in a&#xD;
position where (questions of delicacy could&#xD;
neither be asked nor answered.&#xD;
They were soon unon the floor, gliding away&#xD;
in the soft and dreainy waltz, played as Spani&#xD;
ish musicians know how to play it.&#xD;
The Spanih are the only people in the&#xD;
world who make a luxury ot waltzing. The&#xD;
I)uteh-exeuse me, the Germans--make of it&#xD;
a pers pirative labor ; tlie French go through&#xD;
on railro-ad time ; the Americans go the race-&#xD;
horse gait, and the Enghlih the rough-road,&#xD;
stage-coach style.  But the Spanish glide&#xD;
along like rosyclouds in a breeze-fanned sky,&#xD;
or like dim shadows over softly rippling wa-&#xD;
ters. But here I am again, out of the waltz&#xD;
of my story.&#xD;
Nose onler had the m lrquis received his final&#xD;
instructions from Quiestra, and seen the latter&#xD;
depart fer roni, than he took occasion to&#xD;
rejoin- his daughter and the young American&#xD;
officer. To t lie utter astonishment of both, as&#xD;
well as pleasure of one of them, he seemed&#xD;
in the most allable hiunor, and remarked that&#xD;
he was very hapy1. to see them enjoying the&#xD;
pleasures of the evening so much."&#xD;
&#xD;
ERS OF TILE GULF.                        13&#xD;
"I hope, lieutenant," said he to Allen,&#xD;
"that -our stay will be long in our port, and&#xD;
that, while here, your visits will be frequent,&#xD;
and without restr'aint&#xD;
I shall be only too happy to make my vis-&#xD;
its frequent !" replied Allen; and rest assured&#xD;
that no call but that of duty will hurry me&#xD;
away from the hospitality of your pert !"&#xD;
The marquis bowed, and passed on, leaving&#xD;
the heart of Allen bounding high upon the&#xD;
crested waves of hope. But Maraquita was&#xD;
sad. She knew that this sudden change of&#xD;
manner in her father masked some new design,&#xD;
at the bottom of which lay her antipathy-&#xD;
Quiestra. And her greatest misery was, that&#xD;
she could not fathom the design-knew not&#xD;
how to meet what she felt in her heart was a&#xD;
plot to wreck his happiness and her own.&#xD;
But, concealing her thoughts to the best of&#xD;
her ability, she moved on with him as her solo&#xD;
partner (luring the rest of the night, niuch to&#xD;
the distaste of many an officer who would have&#xD;
shed blood for the honor of having her hand&#xD;
even in a single dance, and more to the sur-&#xD;
prise of others, who wondered why her Ameri-&#xD;
can-hating father should leave her in such&#xD;
perilous company so long.&#xD;
But so it was , and when, as the rosy her-&#xD;
alds of the coming day came swiftly from the&#xD;
eastern, sea-board, Allen found himself once&#xD;
more on board of his beautiful schooner, his&#xD;
heart was too full of the joy of the last few&#xD;
hours to permit of his thinking of sleep.&#xD;
There are times of neril as well as times of&#xD;
trouble, when-sleep will not come to the eve-&#xD;
lids of the weary ; and there are times when&#xD;
joy and lmppiness forbids one to close his eyes.&#xD;
May such sleeplessness be the fate of my read&#xD;
ers !&#xD;
CHAPTER VIT.&#xD;
The Pilot, of Norfolk, the consort,-built&#xD;
of the Alligator, was indeed a beautiful vi ssel;&#xD;
and so thought Charley Howard, her ttapo-&#xD;
rary commander, who was engaged to ta'h: her&#xD;
to Yera Cruz, there to deliver hice to the Mexi-&#xD;
can government to act as a privateer. 'He was&#xD;
in the lahama Channel, heading for the Cu-&#xD;
ban coast, and in Ehe act of taking Ins meridi-&#xD;
an observations to learn his latitud.., when a&#xD;
man forward, on deck (for lie had no look- out&#xD;
aloft). sang out : " Sail ho !"&#xD;
Dropping his quadrant, Iloward seized his&#xD;
spy-glass,'as he cried: "Where away ?"&#xD;
A point or two to windward of the weather&#xD;
how, sir-not one, but three sail, if my eyes&#xD;
don't lie !"&#xD;
"You're right," said IHoward, as he looked&#xD;
in the direction given. After a short recon-&#xD;
noissance, he said. "There are two schooners&#xD;
and a sloop. I suppose they're Cuban coasters,&#xD;
for we should be nearly in to the island now.&#xD;
Luff, there, you at the helm-let her come up&#xD;
a point, and we'll speak the strangers !"&#xD;

&#xD;
heading a little to the northward of west, now&#xD;
hauled more to th .wind and n estward, and as&#xD;
the vessels which IIoward intended to speak,&#xD;
were standing on a course which threw them&#xD;
athwart his bows, they  cry rapidly neared&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The young captain of the schooner looked&#xD;
at theni from time to tiune, but saw nothing&#xD;
which led hin to believe them to be other than&#xD;
coasters, as he had at first supposed. But&#xD;
few men were seen upon theirdeeks, and the&#xD;
sails were neghgeutly trimniied. as those of the&#xD;
lazy Cuban droghers uiiially are-and as to&#xD;
this day you can see them  along that coast ;&#xD;
they were hugged close up to each other, as if&#xD;
there wasmore safety in company than in be-&#xD;
ing apart.&#xD;
The breeze was not fresh, yet stiff enough&#xD;
to send the sharp-built schooner some six or&#xD;
seven knots through the water. In an hour,&#xD;
or little more, the strange sails were close&#xD;
aboard, and Iloward shortened sail to speak&#xD;
them, taking in his foresail and flying-jib, and&#xD;
throwing his fore-topsail and top-gallant-sail&#xD;
aback, while he hauled his jib-sheet to wind-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
As his headway deadened, one of the stran-&#xD;
gers crossed his bow, while the other two&#xD;
headed directly for him to leeward, all having&#xD;
Spanish colors set.&#xD;
"Look oupt there, you lubberly Spanish cubs,&#xD;
or you'll run afoul of us !" shouted howard,&#xD;
as he saw the danger of contact.&#xD;
"Excuse us, Seior Amerieans ; we couldn't&#xD;
well help it !" cried a tall and sp!enidid-looking&#xD;
man, who leaped from the bow of the nearest&#xD;
vessel on to the quarter-deek of the Pilot, and&#xD;
who was instantly followed by fifty or sixty&#xD;
men, armed to the teeth, like liimself.&#xD;
Taken completely I surprise, himself and&#xD;
his feeble crew  entirely unarmed, Ionard&#xD;
could offer no resistance.  Yet the proud&#xD;
Maryland blood in his veins boiled, and angry&#xD;
light flashed im his eye, as lie looked the lead-&#xD;
ing intruder in the face, and boldly asked what&#xD;
the deuce he meant by coming on board of his&#xD;
vessel so unceremoniously ?     '&#xD;
We are rough people, Seior Aniericans !"&#xD;
said the leader ; " and we do not understand&#xD;
ceremony. But we have need of a fast-sailing&#xD;
vessel, andl as yours seems to be speedy, we&#xD;
feel an inclination to try her for a time!"&#xD;
Then I 'mi to under tand that you're a set&#xD;
of bloody pirates !" said IIoward, bitterly.&#xD;
" Oh, no ! by no means, Senor ! We are&#xD;
gentlemen, f ree Rovers-no more ! We ex-&#xD;
act tribute, it is true, from  those who come&#xD;
within our range ; if they are at all obstreper-&#xD;
ous, we somietunes make them unalk the plank ;&#xD;
ut if they are accommodating, and give us all&#xD;
they have with a good grace, why we gener-&#xD;
ally let them keep the most valueless of their&#xD;
possessions-hje !"&#xD;
"Very kind !" said Ioward, bitterly. "And&#xD;

THE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF THE GULF.&#xD;

have them unarmed, and entirely in your&#xD;
power ?"&#xD;
"Yes; but have you no favor to ask for&#xD;
yourself?"&#xD;
"I haye. Will you grant it ?"&#xD;
"If it is not such a one as will compromise&#xD;
me as a man, I will !" said the other.&#xD;
It will prove whether you are a man or&#xD;
not !"'said Howard. "You wear a sword--I&#xD;
have one in my cabin ; and all that I ask is a&#xD;
chance to measure weapons with you on this&#xD;
deck !"&#xD;
Time dark eye of the Spaniard flashed, for&#xD;
the tone of Howard was most insulting. He&#xD;
paused a moment, anid measured the form of&#xD;
his intended competitor with a scornful glance.&#xD;
"Do you know who I am, young Inan ?" he&#xD;
as'ed, after a delay of a minute or more.&#xD;
Who you are, T do not know ! But what&#xD;
you are, I do know. You surely are a pirate,&#xD;
if you refuse to fight me, you are a coward !"&#xD;
"No man lives who can call Edward Colce-&#xD;
frinas a coward the second time !" said the pi-&#xD;
rate leader, in a quiet tone-dangerous, be-&#xD;
cause it was so 'quiet. Go and get your&#xD;
weapon, young man, and if you can conquer&#xD;
me, you and 3 our vessel shall go seot free !"&#xD;
" I am contented w th the -condition !" said&#xD;
the brave young American, and he hastened&#xD;
to his state-room for his sword, a we on with&#xD;
which he was not unacq/ainted, an which, in&#xD;
the hands of his gallan father, ha done good&#xD;
service in the war.of 1, 12 and '3-,&#xD;
In a few moments  ie return d, and the pi-&#xD;
rate leader, in spite f the mm urniured remon-&#xD;
strance of his men, ho dis iked his unineces-'&#xD;
sary exposure to anger humpreaed for this&#xD;
singular and impr mlitu duel.&#xD;
There was not much parade, for HIoward-"&#xD;
who cast away the scpbbard of his weapon as&#xD;
he came on deck, tp show that lie intended to&#xD;
find another sheath for the blade-at once be-&#xD;
gan the attack, and that with a skill and im-&#xD;
petuosity wli h for a tiue rather bothered&#xD;
the pirate, aid forced him to keep upon his&#xD;
guard and to act solely on the defensive.&#xD;
But Howard could not for any length of&#xD;
time exert so much vigor, and as every lunge&#xD;
and cut he made was coolly met and parried by&#xD;
his antagonist, lie soon began to feel that he&#xD;
had taxed his' powers too heavily at the start.&#xD;
And by the ease with whi h the pirate met his&#xD;
most cunning feints and thrusts, he soon felt&#xD;
that lie had found his master. In a short&#xD;
time, instead of attacking, he found himself ne-&#xD;
etssitated t4 stand upon his guard wliout be-&#xD;
ing able to return a lunge. And as the blood&#xD;
of the pirate warmed, his bright steel was&#xD;
more'than once crimsoned with the blood of&#xD;
his over-matched antagonist. - Yet he inflict-&#xD;
ed no mortal wound, and only seemed to see&#xD;
how near lie could come to takmin life without:&#xD;
doimg i t-as savages do sometimes when tlhef&#xD;
torture their captives.&#xD;
"Have you not lost blood enough to cool&#xD;
&#xD;
your mper, senior ?" at last said the pirate,&#xD;
as  e beat down the guard of his weakened&#xD;
o onent, and held him entirely at his mercy.&#xD;
Howard made no reply, but springing back&#xD;
to a fresh position, again raised his weapon.&#xD;
With a skillful turn of his wrist, Colcefri-&#xD;
nas wrenched the weapon from the hand of&#xD;
the young American, who unarmed, but yet&#xD;
unyielding, folded his arms upon his breast,&#xD;
and awaited the expected death-blow. But it&#xD;
did not come.&#xD;
With a quiet smile upon his face, the pirate&#xD;
thief reached out to the flag which dangled&#xD;
from the main peak halliards, and wiped his&#xD;
sword upon it. " Yo'n fence tolerably well,&#xD;
fbr an American !" said lie to Howard. " When&#xD;
I have leisure, I will give you some -lessons&#xD;
which will improve your style. But at pres-&#xD;
ent I have not time. By the way, a friend of&#xD;
yours, Lieutenant Allen, of the Alligators, said&#xD;
that letters for his squadron were expected in&#xD;
your vess-el. have you a mail on board ?"&#xD;
"Yes!" said Howard, moodily. "Perhaps&#xD;
you will take the trouble to deliver the letters&#xD;
yourself?" he added, tauntingly.&#xD;
"Most undoubtedly I shall !" said Colcefri-&#xD;
nas, in a gentle tone. "Lieutenant Allen and&#xD;
myself are on the most friendly terms. I&#xD;
wo uld not permit his letters or those addressed&#xD;
to iny of his officers to be delayed a moment !"&#xD;
"Allen your friend? Why he is sent out&#xD;
to hunt up and destroy such bloody pirates&#xD;
ae you are !"&#xD;
a Yes-and I am going to help him. He&#xD;
tcld me how fast your vessel was, and I made&#xD;
up my mind to procure her for that especial&#xD;
service"      !"             tt'&#xD;
"You mock me, sir !"&#xD;
" You are in error, SeiTor Americano-I- am&#xD;
vury serious. I expect in a very few days to&#xD;
see Mr. Allen, and I shall not only deliver his&#xD;
letters, but tell him that the wicked and re-&#xD;
morseless pirates have captured the fastest&#xD;
schooner that has ever worn the Ameiican&#xD;
flag!"&#xD;
"Tell him that if Charles IIoward had only&#xD;
known that pirates were near, lie never would&#xD;
have been taken alive !" said the American,&#xD;
bitterly.&#xD;
"Your message shall be delivered 1" said&#xD;
Colcefrinas, with a smile. "And now we must&#xD;
part, for time just at the present is valuable to&#xD;
me! Is your long-boat in good condition ?"&#xD;
" Yes ! But why do you ask ?"&#xD;
" l\Ierely to know if it will stand the voyage&#xD;
which you and your crew are about to make&#xD;
in it !"&#xD;
"So you intend to put us adrift in it ?"&#xD;
"Yes, senior. You are excellent at guess-&#xD;
ing !"&#xD;
'" You will permit us to have provisions,&#xD;
water, sails and oars, perhaps, in your gener-&#xD;
osity ?"&#xD;
"The two first you may have! But I can&#xD;
only spare you one oar. That wi11 keep your&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
boat head to sea, and if-a gale does not come&#xD;
up to swamp you, you may be so lucky as to&#xD;
be picked up by some passing vessel. I may&#xD;
send your friend Allen to look for you !"&#xD;
"You are very kind-I hope the d-1 will&#xD;
reward you in the next world, if you miss your&#xD;
due in this !" said Howard, in reply.&#xD;
An hour later, he and his crew in the none&#xD;
too capacious long-boat of the schooner, were&#xD;
alone upon the heaving waters of the Gulf&#xD;
tream, their frail boat steadied by a single&#xD;
oar, being almost even with the water's edge.&#xD;
Their only hope of salvation in life was, that&#xD;
some vessel would pass before a gale should&#xD;
arise, and pick them up.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII&#xD;
"Well, gentlemen, you who have been so&#xD;
anxious to see service will soon have a&#xD;
chanceI" said Lieutenant Allen, one morning,&#xD;
some ten days after the occurrence of the fes-&#xD;
tival spoken of in our first chapter. His first&#xD;
officer had just. reported that three vessels,&#xD;
American men-of-war, were coming up the&#xD;
harbor; and as he had only waited the arrival&#xD;
of these to commence his search for pirates,&#xD;
he had no further excuse for lingering in that&#xD;
too enchanting spot.&#xD;
"Faith, that's blessed news, and good for&#xD;
the dyspepsy, cap'n dear !" said O'Shaughnes-&#xD;
sy, the surgeon.&#xD;
"A disease which will never trouble you,&#xD;
doctor !" said Allen with a smile.&#xD;
"That's true, blessed be the knowledge that&#xD;
keeps it from me !" said the doctor.&#xD;
"Here is a package of letters for you, sir,&#xD;
just brought on board by a stranger from&#xD;
shore, in a small boat !" said a petty officer,&#xD;
handing the package to Allen.&#xD;
"Letters from home and by the Pilot!" ex-&#xD;
claimed the young officer, as he tore open the&#xD;
package. "Forwarded by Colcefrinas, the&#xD;
Pirate, with his compliments to Lieutenant&#xD;
Allen! .Darnation! Where is the messenger&#xD;
who brought these letters? Bring him to me&#xD;
instantly !" added the officer, as he read a&#xD;
scrap of paper which was attached to the pack-&#xD;
age.&#xD;
"He rowed away as soon as le handed&#xD;
the letters over the side, sir! lie did not&#xD;
come on board at all, and is asho e long be-&#xD;
fore this time, sir ?" said the petty o 'cer.&#xD;
Allen made no reply, but tore ope a note&#xD;
addressed to him in the same hand that the&#xD;
scrawl was written in, and his face flushed with&#xD;
anger as he read it. No wonder; its contents&#xD;
were&#xD;
"If the Yankee who commands the Alliga-&#xD;
tor can spare time from his dalliance with the&#xD;
daughter of Garcia de Regla, and would like&#xD;
to measure swords with Colcefrinas the Pirate,&#xD;
he can have an opportunity. The latter has&#xD;
taken the schooner, Pilot, and thinks her very&#xD;
well adapted to his business. Not having any&#xD;

OUR MESS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
pirate-hunting  squadron, Colcefrinas takes&#xD;
pleasure in transmitting them to their des-&#xD;
tination. lie deems it unnecessary to send&#xD;
the government dispatches which he found in&#xD;
the Pilot, as he wishes to preserve the auto-&#xD;
graphs of the Secretary of the Navy, and the&#xD;
Commandant of the Marine Corps. Colcefri-&#xD;
nass can be found on his cruising-ground in the&#xD;
Bahama Channel, and takes this opportunity&#xD;
to assure Lieutenant Allen of his distinguished&#xD;
constideratiorn !"&#xD;
Allen did not hesitate long after perusing&#xD;
this letter. Turning to his first officer, he&#xD;
said&#xD;
"have all ready for sailing in an hour, sir!&#xD;
1s soon as the other vessels come to an an-&#xD;
ebor, send a boat on board of each, telling&#xD;
r;en that I have heard from the pirates, and&#xD;
shall at once sail in search of themr. I have&#xD;
tome business on shore, which attended to, I&#xD;
shall at once weigh anchor. Let the gunner&#xD;
and armorer look to their stores and see that&#xD;
nothing is lacking for service when we sail !"&#xD;
These orders given, Allen sprang into his&#xD;
gig and was quickly rowed to the shore-where,&#xD;
giving directions to his crew to remain in the&#xD;
boat ready for his return, he laid his course&#xD;
for the palace, whither he went with hurried&#xD;
steps.&#xD;
('IHAPrEit LIX&#xD;
"Youl have sad news for ie! I know it! A&#xD;
ark cloud has rested, shadow-like, upon my&#xD;
spirit all the morning, and all the long night&#xD;
t have twssed restlessly u)otn my couch, an-&#xD;
noyed with terrible dreams!' said Mararquita&#xD;
do Regla, as Allen entered her presence but a&#xD;
fsw moments after he left his boat."&#xD;
"Not sad news, but good, my love !" he re-&#xD;
°ponded, gayly, " or at least, it is sad in but&#xD;
on thing -lmust leave you fora time. I ihave&#xD;
heard from Colcefrinas, the pirate, and if he is&#xD;
true to his challenge, will soon have the plla-&#xD;
*ure of meeting him on blue water. Whets he&#xD;
and his gang are exterminated, then  I will re-&#xD;
turn to your side ; and it will be your own&#xD;
fault, my loved one, if we are ever apart again&#xD;
--for if your father then refuses me your hand,&#xD;
I know that you will keep your promise, and&#xD;
be my bride without his consent !"&#xD;
1 will, if you conic back ! Put, oh ! I so&#xD;
fear that you never will come ! I feel a pre-&#xD;
sentimentthat death is near to one, or both of&#xD;
us !" said the lovely girl, and she clung all&#xD;
trembling to his arm, as if she would avert the&#xD;
fate she dreaded, or share it with him.&#xD;
Aht, lieutenant, i am glad to see you! I&#xD;
observe that other of your national vessels&#xD;
rave arrived in our port f" said the father of&#xD;
Maraquita, entering at this moment, but not&#xD;
appearing to notice the position of his daugh-&#xD;
ter, which she changed in an instant, when she&#xD;
heard his voice.&#xD;
Yes, Seior Marquis !" replied Allen, "but I&#xD;
&#xD;
they, as well as myself, will soon be forced by&#xD;
the stern call of duty to tear ourselves from&#xD;
the hospitality of your port and town !"&#xD;
"Why, you surprise me, lieutenant. When&#xD;
and whither do you sail ?"&#xD;
"Immediately, and in search of Colcefrinas,&#xD;
the pirate, who has sent me an audacious chal-&#xD;
lenge !"&#xD;
" Colcefrinas ? Sent you a challenge&#xD;
asked the marquis, in the most utter astonish-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Yes, scilor ! And it will not be long, i&#xD;
hope, before I am ready to make hi   regret&#xD;
his cool audacity,! By the way where s your&#xD;
friend Quiestra ?"&#xD;
"lie? Why do you ask, sir ?" answered the&#xD;
marquis, very much agitated.&#xD;
" Because he promised to take a cruise wittr&#xD;
me, as he knew the coast well and I did not'&#xD;
"lie is here, and ready to keep his prom-&#xD;
ise !"'said a deep, full-toned voice ; and as all&#xD;
three turned toward the open door, the Span-&#xD;
iard known thera as Quiestra made his ap-&#xD;
pearance.&#xD;
The marquis, who had at first seemed sud&#xD;
denly and greatly agitated,-recovered his pres-&#xD;
cnce of mind in an instant, and said&#xD;
"You are welcome back, e ior Quiestra !&#xD;
have you just arrived from your puantation ?"&#xD;
"As you can see by the dust of travel on my&#xD;
person, I have, Seiior Marc uis !''aid the other.&#xD;
Thdn, turning in the most friendly manner to&#xD;
Allen, he asked&#xD;
How go matters with you, amigo io&#xD;
Prosperous, I hope ?"&#xD;
" So, so ! But I sail in an hour-do you in-&#xD;
tend to go with te " replied Allen, to whom&#xD;
he had spoken.&#xD;
If you please. A cruise at sea once more&#xD;
w;ll be a novelty to rme, and iy knowledge of&#xD;
the coast may he of benefit ti you. But ex-&#xD;
cuse te a moment, if you please. I have a&#xD;
message to send back by valet, Mriiano, to my&#xD;
plantation, and then 1 shall ie ready to attend&#xD;
you. Marquis, I wouldspeak a word with you&#xD;
in private, if your leisure will permit it !"&#xD;
The marqurs followed the Spaniard out, ani&#xD;
Allen was again left alone with the idol of his&#xD;
soul, his beloved Maraquita.&#xD;
")o not trust that man, Quiestra!" said&#xD;
the latter, the instant they were alone. " .&#xD;
feel that he meditates some dark evil toward&#xD;
you !"&#xD;
"If he does, he will be foiled, for I am ever&#xD;
upon my guard !" said Alien. " Ite shall not&#xD;
have it in his power to injure me, and should&#xD;
he be so foolish as to attempt it, his punish&#xD;
meat shall be swift and sure !'&#xD;
In a little time Quiestra returned alone,&#xD;
being now armed as when we Inst saw him.&#xD;
1 thought that vearpons amght be of serv-&#xD;

rather interrogative.&#xD;
 Oh, yes," said Quiestra. " I am fond of ex-&#xD;
itement. But supposing you were to capture&#xD;
this Colcefrinas, what would you do with&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"Do with him? Why, hang him to the yard-&#xD;

" Without trial ?" asked the Spaniard qui-&#xD;

Yes! 'What chance does lie give to his un-&#xD;

"What think you he would do with you were&#xD;

I neither know nor care. I should neither&#xD;

And yet you might receive it all the sooner&#xD;
that you did not crave it&#xD;
" You seem to know much of his charac-&#xD;

closely.&#xD;

matched, so far as numbers were concerned.&#xD;
The two schooners stood on until not more&#xD;
than two miles apart, and the probability of&#xD;
their soon being in telling gun-shot of each&#xD;
other, grew into a certainty. But suddenly,&#xD;
as sue things ever come in that coquettish&#xD;
latitude, signs of squalls coining from the&#xD;
westward were seen, and the Pilot hove about&#xD;
and headed in for her former berth.&#xD;
"She declines to meet me 1" muttered Al-&#xD;
len, bitterly. "This olcefrinas is a cowardA "&#xD;
"'Prudence is not cowardice, sir !" said Qui-&#xD;
estra, who stood by his side. "You had bet-&#xD;

"That a white squall is sweeping down&#xD;
upon us, and the sooner sheets and halliards&#xD;

the Spaiiard,&#xD;
"A dark squall, rather than a white one !"&#xD;
muttered Allen, as almost in an instant black&#xD;
driving clouds seemed to shroud sky and wa-&#xD;

save his canvas and spars, for while the men&#xD;
were aloft tking in the one, and the schooner&#xD;
obeying her helm, was heading off shore soJ&#xD;
as to take the wind abaft, it came like the&#xD;
ebullitions of Irish friendship--in a gush--&#xD;
such a one as would have laid the schoonerI&#xD;
on her beam-ends if she had not been so well&#xD;
handled as she was.&#xD;
It came like the charge of a mounted army,&#xD;
sullen and heavy, wild but steady, swueeping'&#xD;
overthe inhuid ivaters which had been calm,i&#xD;
and lifting them up in frothy foam. It came&#xD;
like the first angry hurst of a man in power,&#xD;
who knows ihat his power is not "for all time,'&#xD;
but for a moment, pierce, wild, but began to  t&#xD;
flicker away before its first rude thunders had&#xD;
died into echoes.t&#xD;
Yet it was strong enough to drive.the Alli-&#xD;

three hours it lasted.                     r&#xD;
"gNo hope of seeing the infernal pirates I&#xD;

"The best of hopes ! The very best, if you ti&#xD;

seemed ever to be at hand when his thoughts  A&#xD;
were on duty.                       u   a&#xD;

"I do not think you will'!" said Quiestr,&#xD;
quietly. "But bid your helmsman attend to&#xD;

CHAPTF;R XVI.&#xD;
Tae other Ameriean scsseis followed Allen&#xD;
to sea on the day after he sailed, having hur-&#xD;
riedly taken in water tan provisions. They had&#xD;
scarcely' been lost s ght of, before a Spanish&#xD;
rmcrchartman  came in, having  on  board&#xD;
(harley Howard, and the crew of the 'ilot,&#xD;
whom they had picked up. fortuaatily. The&#xD;
American connander Irurred to his consu&#xD;
to state the occurrenici"s whit-h had deprived&#xD;
him of his vessel; and be the advice of the&#xD;
latter, who accompanied n, he at once pi'o-&#xD;
"ceded to inform tre Intendente-(, nercal of the&#xD;
same.&#xD;
The marquis did not seem at all startled by&#xD;
the news, for news it was not to him. Hl" knew&#xD;
it already. le merely replied&#xD;
"There is a scruadron on the cet, of ru m'&#xD;
own countrymen, and they may recover your&#xD;
vessel!"4&#xD;
"So I hear, and I'm off to help thin, if your&#xD;
excellency will only let me have one of your&#xD;
small guarda costas; and some aris. My&#xD;
crew will be but too glad to measure strength&#xD;
with the bloody pirates on fair chances&#xD;
I have no vessel which I can spare," re-&#xD;
plied the mard uis to Howard, coldly.&#xD;
"Then let me have some arms. I will fit up&#xD;
my long-boat-she can run down the coast!"&#xD;
urged the young American.&#xD;
" Armed boats without a license arc not&#xD;
allowed on our coast!" said the marquis, evas-&#xD;
ively.       -.&#xD;
"Allowed or not, there are plenty of them,&#xD;
as our suffering merohantmen know !" said the&#xD;
consul, in a sarcastic tone.&#xD;
"Not when or where it is in our power to&#xD;
prevent it !" replied the marquis, haughtily.&#xD;
"Captain, I uns sorry for your misfortunes,&#xD;
but as you are in tire hands of your own eon-&#xD;
sa, any offer's of aid on my part will only be&#xD;
taking fromt him his prerogatives ! Adieu-I&#xD;
amrr very imuch irgaged this afternoon."&#xD;
This was said iin a tone which implied their&#xD;
dismissal. Howard went away angry at this&#xD;
discourtesy, but the consul had become so'&#xD;
used to such treatment, from the san source,&#xD;
that he paid but little attention to it.&#xD;
"Have you not weapons to arm myself and&#xD;
boat's crew ?" asked tire seaman of the consul.&#xD;
"I regret to say that I have not !"&#xD;
"You can at least tell me where they can be&#xD;
bought !"&#xD;
"Prhey cannot be had in this place without&#xD;
a written permit from the alcalde. Such is the&#xD;
rule all over this tvraut-ridden isle !"&#xD;
&#xD;

important information, which wiil enable him&#xD;
to capture, the chief of the iratical horde&#xD;
whom he is after "&#xD;
What, Coleer''inias ?" exlaimed Howard.&#xD;
Yes, tix' !" said the yonthw, frankly.&#xD;
"  Then I'm with you, young man, if you&#xD;
lead to the devil's own den!t"&#xD;
" Who are you?    Your face is not familiar&#xD;
to me, and yet it seems as if I had seen you&#xD;
before !" said the consul.&#xD;
" It matters inot who I air, Seiior Consul !&#xD;
said the youth. " I know you very'well, and I&#xD;
ans a friend to the North Americarns!"&#xD;
"Whr'tere is the vessel you intend ie to take,&#xD;
and where can we get arms?" asked Iloward.&#xD;
" I shall with your aid hor row the alcalde's&#xD;
private yacht. It is Ariean built, and fast,&#xD;
and he always keeps plenty of arms on board.&#xD;
It is never fully manned, except when he goes&#xD;
on a pleasure-trip, and is moored off the pal-&#xD;
ace-garden. We cars get her away at night, if&#xD;
we are careful and you are skillful, and be at&#xD;
sea long before she is missed !"&#xD;
"You're a trump, and I'm the man to plav&#xD;
the game out With our help !" said Ilowari&#xD;
gayly. " When and where will you meet me&#xD;
and my crew to put our plrian in operation ?'&#xD;
"At the consuls house, as soon as it is&#xD;
dark !" said the young' uran  andi turning on&#xD;
his heel, he went lack the way that he. had)&#xD;
come.&#xD;
" Well, fortune seems on the change for&#xD;
me !" said Howard, in a better humor than&#xD;
when the alcalde dismissed them.&#xD;
"Yes, if tlris young man speaks the truth.&#xD;
I am trying to think whern and where I have&#xD;
seen Rims before, for I am sure 1 have met hins&#xD;
somewhere !" replied  theconsul, as they&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIIL&#xD;
When the morning dawned once more on the&#xD;
Alligat or, Allen was called, as he had directed.&#xD;
wh'n he came on deck, the land-breeze was&#xD;
blowing   mxlv, bringing off the delicious per-&#xD;
fumes of tialffowery clime. But in vain did&#xD;
he and the watoh look for the vessels which&#xD;
they had seen the night before. N ot a sign of&#xD;
theim, or of anything human, could be seen.&#xD;
The small isaids which dotted the water as&#xD;
far to the catward as the eye could reach,&#xD;
were coered with a tail growth of mangrove,&#xD;
nd t I swoodis, and among these, in channels&#xD;
well known to them, but not laid down at that&#xD;
day in an chart, they had undoubtedly found&#xD;
'"Thi Coleefrinas was very bold on paper.&#xD;
I do ot see why he should avoid me now, that&#xD;
I.  a It I!" mittertl Allen, in a tone of dis-&#xD;
ap prinnnt , while he lowered the glass which&#xD;
he dt bll this eye for for some time.&#xD;
iraips he wants to draw you into sonic&#xD;
pmitio twelinee your retreat will be a matter&#xD;
of liflieult v, if not an impossibility !" said a&#xD;
quiet voice, at his elbow.&#xD;
'ihe young lieutenant's face flushed, as he&#xD;
recogt/izcd tie speaker, and he said&#xD;
I would have the Seiior Quiestra to under-&#xD;
stand that I siall never retreat. There is-not&#xD;
an otlieter or iani of all my crew who would&#xD;
not scoro to turn his back oin a bloody pirate,&#xD;
and who would nrot die at his post, rattier than&#xD;
do so. But the vessels which we saw last&#xD;
might eanuot he far away. There has been but&#xD;
little wind all night, and even with sweeps&#xD;
they could have gone no great distance. They&#xD;
imust hbtsome where among these islands, mind&#xD;
I shall man mv boats and try to hunt them up !"&#xD;
The rpaniardI smiled, but made no answer.&#xD;
At the samiie moment, the eye of the young&#xD;
A      urn t htened, for white and clear a1&#xD;
column o suioke rose from an island, not a&#xD;
league distant.&#xD;
°.Man the first, second, and third cutters !"&#xD;
cried Alien}, instantly. " Let every man go&#xD;
fully armed, and put spare ammunition in the&#xD;
boats. lie in a hurry !"&#xD;
While he yet was speaking, another, and&#xD;
then another column of smoke rose from other&#xD;
islethi, a Iit least twenty of them could be&#xD;
5.--&#xD;
1Ini hab, sir, that you said .these islands&#xD;
were unilbh ited!" cried Allen, turning to&#xD;
Qoiestra.&#xD;
I repeat it,''that they are not. Colcefrinas&#xD;
is amusing himself at your expense. He in-&#xD;
tends tt itari you the game of hide and seel,&#xD;
I presum . I will wager that you will pull&#xD;
front island  island, all day, and yet not see&#xD;
a living nui on any of them!"&#xD;
Yet mcii have lighted those fires!l"&#xD;
"Yes-tien or women! But it is not likely&#xD;
they'll care0t oanmain near them on so warm a&#xD;
day as ti l'&#xD;
"I'll s"ott see !" said Allen, and he ordered&#xD;
&#xD;
every boat on board to be got ready for serv-&#xD;
ice, and prepared to go himself in his gig.&#xD;
" Are von not going to join our boat expe,&#xD;
dition, secor ?" asked he of Quiestra.&#xD;
"If 1 thought you'd catch Coleefrinas, I&#xD;
would !" said the Spaniard. " But feeling&#xD;
sure that you will not, I think I shall be more&#xD;
comfortable with my cigar, under your awn-&#xD;
ing, than I should be sweltering in a boat,&#xD;
and fighting musquitos among the islands !"&#xD;
As you like, sir-as you like !" said Allen,'&#xD;
secretly thinking that, despite his fierce looks,&#xD;
the seior was not much of a fighting-man&#xD;
after all.&#xD;
In less than a half-hour, Allen, with more&#xD;
than four fifths of his men in every boat be-&#xD;
longing to the vessel, was pulling away toward&#xD;
the island. And Quiestra smiled grimly as&#xD;
he saw them   depart, for well he knew how&#xD;
fruitless would be their toilsome search.&#xD;
Every officer had been a volunteer on this&#xD;
occasion ; and all were allowed to go but the&#xD;
1lethoric and rather apoplectic-looking doe-&#xD;
:tor, who, under orders, was quite willing to re-&#xD;
main upon the vessel, beneath a cool awning,&#xD;
where he could indulge in his favorite drink,&#xD;
cold brandy punch, to his heart's cohtent. For&#xD;
he had laid in a good quantity of lemons,&#xD;
brandy, and sugar, and the vessel was well&#xD;
provided with water-coolers-that most neces-&#xD;
sary' article in such a climate.&#xD;
The orders of Allen to the doctor, when he&#xD;
left, were to keep the few men he left him on&#xD;
the alert, and to fire a gun if any sails hove in&#xD;
sight. lie was to remain on deck, and also to&#xD;
keep a look-out aloft.&#xD;
' And am I to be cap'n ?" asked the doctor,&#xD;
of Allen.&#xD;
"You are to act as such in my absence.&#xD;
Remember that every gun is loaded ; and if&#xD;
you should be attacked, defend yourself to the&#xD;
last, and blow up the magazine before you&#xD;
suffer yourself to be taken. If-you don't, I'll&#xD;
blow you up if we ever meet on earth, or e'en&#xD;
in a hotter place !"-&#xD;
S" How long d'ye mane to be gone, cap'n&#xD;
dear ?" asked O'Shaughnessy.&#xD;
"I know not. Notlong, I hope; for I expect&#xD;
soon to find these audacious villains, and mean&#xD;
to make short work with them."&#xD;
A sardonic sneer flitted over the face of Qui-&#xD;
estra, but it was tiot noticed, for his head&#xD;
was turned in another direction. And in five&#xD;
minutes more Allen and all the boa's' crews&#xD;
were gone, aail soon lopt to sight among'the&#xD;
islands.&#xD;
"There goes as good a -heart as ever bate&#xD;
beneath a blue coat!" said O'3haughness, as&#xD;
he gazed after his departing leader. "I hope&#xD;
the.day is a long way off that calls him out o'&#xD;
the world. Let's drink his health, senior "&#xD;
"With pleasure, but you. must drink it In&#xD;
some choice old liquor that I brought on&#xD;
board with my stores. It is Castillian brandy,&#xD;
bottled forty years ago !"&#xD;

&#xD;
ehooner, and the approaching vessels outsider&#xD;
ad felt as if, at least, there was funm ahead,&#xD;
or there is no better fun for a true sailor than&#xD;
good fight in a good cause. The sails con-&#xD;
ig in with a light breeze astern, were about&#xD;
quidistnnt from the schooner, and, showing&#xD;
merucan colors, caine on rather faster than&#xD;
he boats, and'were coming to an anchor, and&#xD;
lowing up their canvas, when Allen dashed&#xD;
aongside of his vessel.'&#xD;
lie was the first to spring on board, sabre&#xD;
Sand, fo lie feared some dark treachery&#xD;
lucre, in that Jis was not hailed from the&#xD;
schooner, nor a uld a single living person be&#xD;
een.&#xD;
It is unnecessary for us to re-describe the&#xD;
ppearance of the doctor and the crew, but as&#xD;
e left them in a former chapter, so Allen&#xD;
found them.&#xD;
lIe was too angry to laugh - too much&#xD;
mazed to feel diverted ; but as he seized the&#xD;
yet stupCtied doctor by the shoulder and shook&#xD;
him, he asked, in his loudest, bitterest tone&#xD;
"What does this masquerade mean, sir&#xD;
Speak ! what does it meanu .&#xD;
"l.e jabers! cap'in, i it' yon that- a talkin&#xD;
aud who arc you talkmi' to), amnd where itn the&#xD;
divil's unhowly name am I?" asked the doe-&#xD;
tor, lookmig with half-opened eyes on the feath-&#xD;
ery semi-circle before hin, and vaimly endes-.&#xD;
v oring to u-is-s.&#xD;
v lowr mie you in this fix ?" asked Allen,&#xD;
as with his knife he severed the doctor's bomd.&#xD;
while the boats' crews crowding aboard ende-&#xD;
vored but in vain to stitle their laugtaliter at the&#xD;
sight before thema.&#xD;
The holy sants only know, and it's theu&#xD;
you'll have to ask for information . exclaimed&#xD;
the doctor, as he looked at his p"ron fons&#xD;
head to foot.&#xD;
lBe the man that learned Mioses his leathers,&#xD;
it's me-self would like to know how these feith-&#xD;
ers grew to me.- I&#xD;
While the doctor was considering this mst&#xD;
pertinent question, tie mien who had just comn'&#xD;
on board were releasiug their comrades from&#xD;
their bonds. Allen, meanwhile, whose eye had&#xD;
caught a sight of the note beneath the flag,&#xD;
was perusing to him its iinexplicablec on-&#xD;
tents.&#xD;
" Quiestra has been taken away, and Colce-&#xD;
forina s himself his been on board according to&#xD;
this note," he cried. " But who on heart h can be&#xD;
the dearer friend whom ae speaks of f? By&#xD;
lietaveas, there is a deep mystery inmall this&#xD;
which I would fam unravell" he added, in a&#xD;
lower tone.&#xD;
" Every gun is spiii, all of our saill arsa&#xD;
are gone, mid the Amaazte has been emptied.&#xD;
sir," reported the fit -lieutenait to Allen.&#xD;
"The whole vessel has - eu ruansacked, and&#xD;
robbed of everything vtl1uad."&#xD;
" And she is leaking, iri ; there are three&#xD;
feet of water in the hol,' said the carpenter,&#xD;
who had just been sounding the puitips.&#xD;

''5&#xD;
&#xD;
.o      " The infernal wretch ! Why did he not&#xD;
sink the vessel while she was in his power, in-&#xD;
stead of merely disabling ?" muttered Allen,&#xD;
angrily. Then turning to the lieutenant, he&#xD;
bade him1 put one watch of the crew at the&#xD;
pumps-told the carpenter to seek out and&#xD;
try to stop the leaks, and then bade the other&#xD;
men help to free their unfortunate comrades&#xD;
from the disagreeable garments left on them by&#xD;
Colcefrinas.&#xD;
The doctor had already disappeared in the&#xD;
direction of his ci ate-room--whence his voice,&#xD;
heard in low and bitter oaths, and in calls up-&#xD;
on his servant for sponge, brushes, spirits of&#xD;
turpentine, and brandy, gave token that he&#xD;
also way trying to renovate.&#xD;
Allen had but just ordered the ensign to be&#xD;
hoisted up properly, Ihen boats approached&#xD;
from his consort vessels with their respective&#xD;
conmades in them.&#xD;
What in Heaven's name is the matter here,&#xD;
Allen ?" asked the first ollicer who sprung on&#xD;
board.&#xD;
Nothing, but that Pvo been a egregrious&#xD;
fool !" said Allen. " Nothing else n the world.&#xD;
I was led to take nearly all m  crew away in&#xD;
boats to try and hunt on   he pirates, who&#xD;
made signal- mokes on a tyen different islands;&#xD;
and while I was gone, y remaining crew aere&#xD;
hoeus-pocuoed in ))me way - what way I&#xD;
have not vet found out, but soon will-and the&#xD;
pirates havte leen here and spiked my guns,&#xD;
robbed and scuttled the vessel."&#xD;
"'Pretty well done, lut no blood spilled so&#xD;
tr," said the other, with a smile. " Now that&#xD;
we are all toetherl , pecrhaps we can turn thn'&#xD;
tableau on these gentlemen. and slow them a&#xD;
Yankbe trick or two. Don't be,disheartened,&#xD;

" I am not dliheartenied, Gregory," replied&#xD;

-"Yes ; what i it '" said K earey, who at&#xD;
that instant mtepped n board, closely followed&#xD;
by his last-imnhed colleague.&#xD;
Allen's mshies were explained, cd the three&#xD;
other otileers willingly agreed to remain at an&#xD;
anchor until he could'retit and return; at the&#xD;
&#xD;
same time receiving directtis to send strong&#xD;
boat expeditions out to try and discover the&#xD;
depot or main rendezvous of the lirtes. for&#xD;

more fitted  for decent society than he was&#xD;
when we ,4ast saw them, though his head still&#xD;
was feathery, and his red face looked the more&#xD;
fiery for its recent alcoholic sernhbinas.&#xD;

he added : "Is she missing ?"&#xD;

she has gone to seek you;who so vilely have&#xD;
stolen her affections from me !"&#xD;
"Marquis de Regla, this is strange language&#xD;
for you to use, who so lately permitted me the&#xD;
utmost freedom of access to her.' But your&#xD;
feelings at her loss-if indeed shie'ke lost-are&#xD;
a sufficient excuse with me!&#xD;

an empress desire, stood a pale, tearful, but cove, in whidh the- lady's couch was placed ;&#xD;
yet very lovely girl. She stood in an attitude, and though thus not left quite alone, Mara-&#xD;

hands were clasped together, as if bound by  on her cheek, brighter, it seemed to him, than&#xD;
the icy manacles of despair.               he had ever before noted there. He hal come&#xD;
But at the sound of a coming footstep she expecting to find her drooping, wretched-a&#xD;
aroused-aroused almost fiercely, brushed the  leader at his feet. Now, almost queenly in&#xD;
tear-drops from her cheeks, and drew her form  her majestic beauty, she stood erect, and with&#xD;

The door opened ; and her fierce, deter-   She made no reply ; but gazed upon him&#xD;

came was not the one whom she had expected.  "And your power of conversation sums to&#xD;

Mariano. And in his look there was such a "When I was last here, you tried threats, ro-&#xD;

it was no woiiler the lady's fierce glance had thought you grandly beautiful when, in your&#xD;
so suddenly softened.                      anger, you cursed me-none but a very pretty&#xD;
"You expected my master, lady," said the  woman can curse, and lose nothing of her&#xD;

Wihy does the enorita so dread him? Is my Ether's consent, I leaned upon the arm of&#xD;

parently careless manner.                  birth-night ?" she asked, in a tone even more&#xD;
"Is le'not my captor and my jailer ?" asked  sarcastic than his own had been.&#xD;
the fair girl; "has he not long been hated by "Your heart's husband !" he cried, bitterly. -&#xD;
me? This, as his confidential attendant, you "Your heart will soon be widowed, if he hold&#xD;
&#xD;
that relation to it! His doom is sealed ; for&#xD;
within three days he will be in my power, and&#xD;
with his whole crew shall be sent to eternal&#xD;
perdition ! If you doubt it, you shall see his&#xD;
head, and that shall grace our bridal feast !"&#xD;
"Monster! I have known you to boast be-&#xD;
fore.  heaven will protect him; and your&#xD;
guardian, who reigns below, will desert vou&#xD;
" Hardly ! I have served him too long and&#xD;
well for that. But, no more of this nonsense.&#xD;
You, having found the use of your tongue,&#xD;
may belay its running-gear for a while,'and&#xD;
open your ears. I have been to see your fa-&#xD;
tier."&#xD;
"Does he know where I am ?"&#xD;
"lie knows that you are my guest."&#xD;
"And is he content with that knowledge ?"&#xD;
" Perfectly ; but would like to see you as&#xD;
soon as convenient after you have become my&#xD;
wife. Why do you smile, fair lady, so mock-&#xD;
ingly, ?"&#xD;
"It amuses me to notice with what grace&#xD;
you can utter falsehoods."&#xD;
"But, by heaven ! I utter the truth. You&#xD;
smile again !"&#xD;
"Yes, to hear you swear by a place of which&#xD;
you know nothing now, and which will never&#xD;
know anything of you !"&#xD;
"You seem determined to provoke me! It&#xD;
is rather a dangerous amusement, as you may&#xD;
find to your cost."&#xD;
"Those who do not fear danger, never pause&#xD;
to count the cost."&#xD;
"And so you do not fear me ?"&#xD;
"We are not apt to fear those whom we&#xD;
despise !"&#xD;
"Girl, beware ! Do not tempt my good-&#xD;
nature too far!"&#xD;
"Your good-nature ! Let the ape boast of&#xD;
its beauty-the serpent of its harmlessness,&#xD;
after this !"&#xD;
"You will regret this, proud girl; but I will&#xD;
not war in words with you now. When next&#xD;
we meet, prelpme for two pleasant surprises.&#xD;
I shall bring you two presents: one will be&#xD;
your wedding-ring-the other, the head of&#xD;
your heart's husband Z"&#xD;
With a frown darker yet than his threats,&#xD;
the pirate turned away, and strode heavily&#xD;
from the room.&#xD;
After the sound of his footsteps had died&#xD;
away entirely, Mariano came out from  his&#xD;
place of concealment.&#xD;
"You bore yourself bravely, lady-almost&#xD;
too bravely, [fear ; for he will suspect some&#xD;
hope has cheered your heart-some thought&#xD;
that you may yet escape," said he.&#xD;
"No; he will, rather, think that my $espe-&#xD;
ration has forced away from my heart all fear&#xD;
of him, and that I am' provoking him to slay&#xD;
me !" said the lady. "But what did he mean&#xD;
'by saying that he had Allen in his power-or&#xD;
woul have, in three days ?"&#xD;
"That a challenge has passed between them&#xD;
to meet upon the ocean, vessa~r to vessel."&#xD;
&#xD;
"-Then I fear not the result. Allen will be&#xD;
the victor !"&#xD;
"Were it not for treachery, lady, he might."&#xD;
"For treachery? What do you mean ?"&#xD;
"That your own father, lady, who supplies&#xD;
Allen with his powder and arms, is to give&#xD;
him a worthless.article ; and thus the Ameri-&#xD;
can will be in the power of Coleefrinas !"&#xD;
"Great Heaven ! Oh, do not say that my&#xD;
father will be guilty of such an act ! It can-&#xD;
not-must not be 1"&#xD;
"Alas, lady, it doubtless has been done,&#xD;
and the gallant American is by this time at&#xD;
sea, proceeding to the spot where my master&#xD;
is to meet him."&#xD;
"Oh, cruel, cruel butchery !  This must&#xD;
not be. Mariano, he must be warned in some&#xD;
way. Can I not be set free-or, in some dis-&#xD;
guise, get on board the vessel of your master&#xD;
-so that, if I :cannot save him whom I love,&#xD;
I can at least die with or near him!"&#xD;
Mariano shook his'head mournfully, as if to&#xD;
imply that it was impossible.&#xD;
Tears started in those black eyes, which so&#xD;
lately had flashed back glance for glance with&#xD;
the haughty pirate.&#xD;
"0 Mariano, you have never loved !" said&#xD;
Maraquita, with a low sob of agony.&#xD;
"Would to Heaven I never had-did not !"&#xD;
said Mariano ; and never did a deeper blush&#xD;
suffuse the cheek of a timid girl, than for a&#xD;
moment reddened his.&#xD;
A light step at the door-a  w "hist"-&#xD;
was heard.&#xD;
"I am called ; your sentinel, who is my&#xD;
friend, has given me my warning !" said Marr-&#xD;
ano, hastily. "If I can see you or aid you&#xD;
again, I will."&#xD;
,lie bowed his head, and kissed Maraquita's&#xD;
band; then, in a moment, was gone.&#xD;
When she raised her hand, and saw that he&#xD;
b"ad left a tear-drop there, she wondered, but&#xD;
only said:&#xD;
"It is a jewel. All that I have. A gem of&#xD;
pity. heaven help him whom I love ! Hea-&#xD;
ven help me !"&#xD;
And again she paled, and drooped down as&#xD;
despairingly as we found her when we opened&#xD;
this chapter.&#xD;
ChAPTER XXIIL&#xD;
Once more at the rendezvous. The harbor&#xD;
was full of small boats, and there were several&#xD;
more of the sloops and schooners in than were&#xD;
there when we first described the place. And&#xD;
by the number of men aboard and on shore,&#xD;
not less than a thousand, perchance one-half&#xD;
as many more, it was evident . that the pirates&#xD;
had been driven in by the vigilance of the&#xD;
cruisers outside, and were collected either for&#xD;
some formidable foray, or else for the purpose&#xD;
of making a last and a desperate defence. The&#xD;
latter, indeed, seemed most probable, for all of&#xD;
the vessels, with one execution, were moored&#xD;

imost as far as the booming of a gun.&#xD;
Coleefrinas was soon upon his deck, thlow&#xD;
word of command was given, the anchor ran&#xD;
up, and, as if by magic, every sail was hoisted&#xD;
nl sheeted home at once ; and gracefully the&#xD;
schooner veered away toward the narrow en-&#xD;
trance, seeinlug to iove over, rather than&#xD;
through the water. Er the gray of twilight&#xD;

Ihfaxing had his 'ss el b1ou1ght1- s11 itter'ly&#xD;
head to the coniug gale, by the use ofLsweeps,&#xD;
as could he done, Allen-with a ean twice and&#xD;

comig ; now glancing    to the   southward,&#xD;
where, the pirate, at last, was hurriedly short-&#xD;
euing sad-and then looking to windward, to&#xD;
see how soon the storm-king would be down&#xD;
upon fon.&#xD;
Not long had he to wait. Its distant roar,&#xD;
like the tumultuous voics of auuimberless&#xD;
multitude of mnaddene~d men, eang~ sweeping&#xD;
over the waters ; the light fled from before its&#xD;
ehon front ; the wat ers rose i a wall of foamy&#xD;
ihite, as they felt its strong breath ; and the&#xD;
oldest of those hardy seamen looked for a&#xD;
sitr or a rope to clut cl lwhen it' gale should&#xD;
strike their brave yet feteble craft.&#xD;
"lod on all ! Two men at t10helmeh, and&#xD;
when she 'veers, let her go before it. Let a&#xD;

OUR MESS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF THE GULF.&#xD;
&#xD;
in a darkness almost as dense as that of night,&#xD;
while Allen and his officers kept close watch&#xD;
for the pirate ; for the course upon which&#xD;
they were driven was nearly or quite toward&#xD;
where he had last been seen. Suddenly, close&#xD;
aboard on their starboard hand, she was seen,&#xD;
but for an instant: an almost dismantled hulk&#xD;
--her hull encumbered with the wreck of&#xD;
spars and tattered sails, yet driving in the&#xD;
same direction as themselves.&#xD;
Allen had time only to get a glance at the&#xD;
face of Colcefrinas, who, white with rage,&#xD;
shook his hand at him as they passed ; and&#xD;
then they were separated, to meet again-&#xD;
when, neither knew.&#xD;
By signs, Allen now caused the crew to take&#xD;
in both the main and foresail ; and had he&#xD;
dared, lie would have brought the vessel by&#xD;
the wind-for he asked no more now than a&#xD;
chance to meet Iis foe, while his vessel was so&#xD;
crippled that it could be boarded by Allen&#xD;
without exposing the crew of the latter to the&#xD;
batteries of the well-munitioned foe. But the&#xD;
hurricane was ins its strength still, and no ves-&#xD;
sel could have done otherwise than se d he-&#xD;
fore it. his only hope was that it might lull in&#xD;
time for him to take aback track, before his&#xD;
enemy could so repair Iis craft as to be able to&#xD;
work and manouvre his vessel. But on through&#xD;
the long night she flew, until the noon of the&#xD;
next day, when the wind died away into a gen-&#xD;
tier gale ; and well indeed was it for that&#xD;
brave crew that it (lid: for scarcely had a man&#xD;
stepped above the rail when the welcome order&#xD;
to make sail was given, than the cry of "land&#xD;
ho l" was heard.&#xD;
And there it was-the rock-bound coast of&#xD;
Cuba--so close aboard, that two hours more&#xD;
of that hurricane would have driven the brave&#xD;
schooner upon it: and that would have been&#xD;
the end of ier and hers.&#xD;
-"It seems to me that this part of the coast.&#xD;
looks familiar, sir," said the first lieutenant to&#xD;
the young commander, as both were surveying&#xD;
it through their spy-glasses.&#xD;
"I know it well," said Allen ; "but where&#xD;
our consorts have found a harbor is a mystery&#xD;
to me. I can see the channel where they&#xD;
were when we sailed, and the sea breaks high&#xD;
upon the reefs which acted as a breakwater&#xD;
there. But I see no sign of a vessel in shore&#xD;
anywhere."&#xD;
"Perhaps they have found a harbor under&#xD;
the lee of s me of the islands near. I know&#xD;
that neither Gregory nor Kearney would break&#xD;
their promise not to leave, without they were&#xD;
forced to do it by stress of weather."&#xD;
"True. Fire a gun, and perhaps it will be&#xD;
heard and answered by them!" said Allen.&#xD;
"You forget, sir, that our powder won't&#xD;
burn," said the lieutenant, with a smile.&#xD;
"I do not forget, though, that I have a&#xD;
small keg of Duponts prime rifle-powder in&#xD;
my state-room, bought for my own private&#xD;
use. Take that," replied Allen.&#xD;
In a little while, a gun was loaded with this&#xD;
&#xD;
powder, and its heavy report went thundering&#xD;
over the water.&#xD;
And not more than five minutes had elapsed&#xD;
before an answering gun was heard, away in&#xD;
shore, among the islands ; and soon a boat&#xD;
was discovered making out from behind a&#xD;
point toward the old anchorage. At about&#xD;
the same time, a man who was aloft, fiddig&#xD;
the main-royal-mast, sang out that he saw the&#xD;
masts of vessels over the tree-tops ahead.&#xD;
"All is right yet," said Allen. " As powder&#xD;
is all we want, we can get it from them, and&#xD;
stand out yet and catch our adversary, before&#xD;
he knows that we have changed our ha lpow-&#xD;
der for good, and his very suprise will n eaken&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"True, sir. We are indeed fortune-favored&#xD;
on this cruise. Shall I make more sail-"&#xD;
"No ; stand i, under easy canvas, till we&#xD;
speak the boat. Perchance they can pilot us&#xD;
into a better harbor, where a right s rest for&#xD;
the crew and a chance to tauten our stretch-&#xD;
ed rigging will not lessen our efficiency !"&#xD;
In a short time the schooner reached the&#xD;
anchorage, where the boat boarded her, prov-&#xD;
iug to be one from  one of the other vessels,&#xD;
which had foun .1 safe anchorage in a snmal bay&#xD;
between the islands, and out-rode the gale&#xD;
without a strain upon their cables. A hei at&#xD;
once decided to run im there, and make his&#xD;
preparations for going to sea with his consorts&#xD;
i the morning-confident that the pirate could&#xD;
not escape all three, if they took different&#xD;
courses to intercept him ; for now, iii conse-&#xD;
quence of the treachery in Iis supply of pow-&#xD;
der, evidently known to, if not concocted by&#xD;
Colcefrinas, he felt himself freed from all con-&#xD;
ditionus to meet him singly, and itended-as&#xD;
he had done at first-to hunt hun out nmsd de-&#xD;
stroy hinm as he would a bloodhound, or any&#xD;
other cruel, wortkless, and merciless least.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII,&#xD;
When, from his keen-eyed look-out aloft.&#xD;
Colcefrinas first heard that the island of his&#xD;
challenged battle-ground was in sighi, and also&#xD;
that a sail which well he knew was the Alhi-&#xD;
gator was also on the ground, his boy wars&#xD;
more like that of a savage than a mi an. lIe&#xD;
ordered a cask of brandy brought on deck,&#xD;
and the head to be strived in. Then, with his&#xD;
own hands, he stirred in pound after ponl of&#xD;
gunpowder, a ter the manner of the old bue-&#xD;
caneers, whose actions he loved but too well&#xD;
to uitate ir more ways than one r; and drink-&#xD;
rig first himself, bade each of the crew follow&#xD;
irs example.&#xD;
"  lere "-re cried, holding a drimking-cup&#xD;
only used by him on such occasions as this, or&#xD;
after some fearful battk--a cup composed of a&#xD;
nUMAN SKULL-'' here is that we rmy drmik&#xD;
the blood of our Yankee foes erc the un sets&#xD;
ji the west, os' fie sup with the devil ir 13rim-&#xD;
stone Hall below !"&#xD;
With fiendish shouts tire pirate e--Crouwedd&#xD;
up, and from that well-known cup, w itimure&#xD;
&#xD;
than once had been reddened by the tide of&#xD;
life, they followed their leader's draught and&#xD;
toast!  And then they danced and sang&#xD;
like demons, and drank until they were mad-&#xD;
dened into tigers rather than men-if men they&#xD;
ever were.&#xD;
Meanwhile, Coleefrinas raved, and stamped,&#xD;
and swore, because the wind did not blow&#xD;
stronger to carry him more quickly to the&#xD;
place where he supposed his victim would fall&#xD;
into his power.&#xD;
The curses of bad men avail not much-at&#xD;
least this was the case with Colcefrinas, for the&#xD;
more he stormed the less the wind blew, until&#xD;
at last it died away, and his vessel rocked idly&#xD;
in the calm. The look-out, who had come&#xD;
down from aloft to get his allowance of grog,&#xD;
had not noticed the taking in of canvas on&#xD;
board the A merican, nor had any of the offi-&#xD;
ers or crew been sufficiently observant to see&#xD;
the now swift-rising storm.&#xD;
And they had drank ; and Coleefrinas would&#xD;
have raved until it had been upon them all&#xD;
unprepared, probably, had not a new idea&#xD;
struck his mind.&#xD;
" We will board them in our boats !" he&#xD;
cried. " They have no powder to hurt us, and&#xD;
we can cut their throats like dogs as they are !"&#xD;
Again and again the crew cheered ; pnd&#xD;
Colcefrinas raised his glass to see how far&#xD;
away she was. At first, he could not see her,&#xD;
for. her 'canvas had been reduced, and she&#xD;
seemed but a speck on the yet glassy sea-no&#xD;
larger than a gull resting on its bosom. But&#xD;
when he did, and saw that she had not only&#xD;
shortened sail, but was also sending down her&#xD;
upper spars, his seaman's sense at once return-&#xD;
ing to him told him the reason, and a quick&#xD;
glance at the swift-coming storm also made&#xD;
him aware of the peril to his own craIt.&#xD;
"Silence, fore and adft!" he shouted. "Let go&#xD;
sheets and halliards by the run. Clew up,&#xD;
brail up, haul down, and furl everything.&#xD;
Work, curse youwork, or the storm will do&#xD;
the work for you!1"&#xD;
The men, thus urged by one who sel&#xD;
dons spoke so much without dire necessity,&#xD;
sprung to 'their work as rapidly as they could.&#xD;
But some were half-helpless from drink; for&#xD;
though combat would have manddened them,&#xD;
they had no moral courage to meet this new&#xD;
danger, and their brute strength left them,&#xD;
The sheets and halliards were let go in a mo-&#xD;
mrent, nod ninny men sprung aloft to furl the&#xD;
sail. But before this could be half done, the&#xD;
gale was upon them, and though their chief&#xD;
shouted to them to lay down from aloft and&#xD;
save themselves, not half wio went up could&#xD;
do it, before the fierce storm came crashing,&#xD;
with 'its thundering force, along--shivering&#xD;
spars and rending sails like reeds and rotten&#xD;
fibres with its breath. And men and spars,.&#xD;
Went together over into the seething foans, and&#xD;
the staunch vessel would herself inevitably&#xD;
have gne under, had she not by clhnnce-drift&#xD;
&#xD;
47&#xD;
&#xD;
have happened to be heading directly from the&#xD;
storm when it struck her. She buried for a&#xD;
moment ; then, as her weight of spars went over&#xD;
her bows, she staggered up, and, with all their&#xD;
weight clinging to and clogging her hull, wal-&#xD;
lowed on amid the fearful chaos bf the tempest&#xD;
In terror at the fate of so many of their&#xD;
comrades, and appalled by the suddenness of&#xD;
the peril, the crew-who were left worked but&#xD;
feebly in clearing away the wreck. She was&#xD;
in this condition when, light and free, guided&#xD;
like a bird before the wind, the American&#xD;
schooner, which they had almost deemed their&#xD;
prize, flew by them-their colors aloft, their&#xD;
crew safe, their officers exultant, even amid the&#xD;
storm.&#xD;
Colcefrinas was almost mad enough to slave&#xD;
himself, He shook his clenched fist at the&#xD;
passing vessel, and shouted out his bitterest&#xD;
curses ; but they eould  t rise even to his&#xD;
own ear above the wild roar of the hurricane&#xD;
And a moment later, the vessel was far ahead&#xD;
in the gloom. le glanced at the compass a&#xD;
moment, and muttered : "Let it blow so for&#xD;
ten or twelve hours more, and her bones will&#xD;
grate on Cuban rocks 1"&#xD;
Then, with some of his best men under hi&#xD;
immediate eye, he set to 'ork, with a seaman's&#xD;
skill, to clear away the spars that were adrift&#xD;
and to get the noble craft beneath him inte&#xD;
something like working order.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIUl.&#xD;
In that grand but gloomy cavern-home-or&#xD;
prison, should 1 call it - poor Maraquita de&#xD;
Regla hardly knew the difference between day&#xD;
and night, except as she might judge by the&#xD;
time when two black mutes--or mutes they&#xD;
seemed to be ; for they never spoke to her&#xD;
except by signs-brought her food and drink.&#xD;
No time-piece was there amid all the rest of&#xD;
the luxurious furniture ; and if there had been&#xD;
she would have paid but little note to time,&#xD;
except to feel that the hours were terribly&#xD;
wearisome and long.&#xD;
One night-she judged 'twas night, because&#xD;
some hours before her supper had been&#xD;
brought-she woke from an uneasy slumber.&#xD;
and started--for above her couch bent a tall&#xD;
and stately woman, of rare and queenly beauty.&#xD;
She was not regarding her with a look of extra-&#xD;
ordinary kindness, nor yet with an expression&#xD;
apparently other than that of curiosity. low&#xD;
she came there, from whence, and for what&#xD;
pumrpose-who she was, were all questions im-&#xD;
mediately asked in Maraquita's mind; but not&#xD;
responded to. The poor girl haud again some-&#xD;
what drooped since Mariaano's last interview&#xD;
with her ; for hope's is but a flickering fire,&#xD;
and must be fed constantly to burn brightly.&#xD;
Maraquita was about to speak, but the stran-&#xD;
ger anticipated her:&#xD;
"Do you love Eduardo Coleefrinas ?" she&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
" No I I loathe rhn " was the ready reply&#xD;

OUR MESS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
an involuntary cheer burst from every throat,&#xD;
for the men seemed to think no other vessel&#xD;
could be in their path thai that for which&#xD;
they were in search.&#xD;
On. more, and this time with.a heart beat-&#xD;
ing strong with hope and ambition, Allen gave&#xD;
the'"der to teat to quiartrs, and the men and&#xD;
officer.  rang to their stations with an alac-&#xD;
rity which proved their anxiety to be at&#xD;
work to be at least equal to his own. The men&#xD;
were at once put to exercise, while the vessel&#xD;
rapidly clove the water in the direction of the&#xD;
just-dnecovered sail.&#xD;
Allen, taking his telescope, went forward to&#xD;
examine her, and when he saw that it was a&#xD;
vessel almost entirely dismantled, he did not&#xD;
doubt but that it was the pirate ; but wonder-&#xD;
,d why a man like Colcefrinas should not&#xD;
have sooner got up jury-masts and put her&#xD;
into something like working order.&#xD;
While he was ints cogitating, the look-out&#xD;
aloft announced another sail in sight, a little&#xD;
$          to windward of the first ; and without having&#xD;
occasion to awk any'questions, -Allen at once&#xD;
.ow the other stranger, -which appeared to&#xD;
have been under little or no canvas, and had&#xD;
thus been unnotice . Bun now, as if by magic,&#xD;
her taut spars were covered with canvas,&#xD;
and she seemed to haul up on the same course&#xD;
which the Alligator was heading.&#xD;
Allen didl not need superhuman sagacity&#xD;
to understand how matters stood. He recog-&#xD;
nized the " Pilot" by her build and rig in a&#xD;
moment., and knew ~mtuitiv, lv that the dis-&#xD;
mantled vessel was some fortunate mer-&#xD;
olhantman which had been taken by the pirate-&#xD;
perhaps been entrapped by her signals of dis-&#xD;
tress, and her spars, sails, rigging, etc., used&#xD;
to refl~t the storm-disabled schooner.&#xD;
But sad as the t ought was, that the crew&#xD;
of the merchantnan might have perished, per-&#xD;
haps even then lay bleeding on her decks, Al-&#xD;
len only joyed at the sight of the vessel be-&#xD;
yond, and in his hones soon to have her under&#xD;
his batteries. But'why, when thus evidently&#xD;
ready for action, she should fly from him in-&#xD;
steal of awaiting his approach, at first aston-&#xD;
ished him; but comprehending that the sails&#xD;
of his consorts were in sight yet, his wonder&#xD;
eeassd ; and that especial y,"when he saw&#xD;
that they had altered their courses, and had&#xD;
hauled on a wind in his direction. He now re-&#xD;
gretted that he had not left them at their an-&#xD;
ehorage and sought the adventure alone. But&#xD;
it was too late for regrets. Having the retreat&#xD;
beat, he directed the energies of officers and&#xD;
men to trimming the sails and doing all that&#xD;
could be done to increase his speed. The en-&#xD;
emy was at least five or six miles to windward;&#xD;
and well he knew that the chase would be a&#xD;
long one if Colcefrinasso willed it-for the two&#xD;
vessels, if trimmed aright, were nearly equals.&#xD;
- aIn less than an hour from the time when&#xD;
she was first sighted, Allen was close along-&#xD;
side of the dismantled vessel, which proved, as&#xD;
he supposed, an American     merchantman,&#xD;
&#xD;
schooner rigged and Baltimore built ; and she&#xD;
had served but too good a purpose for the pi-&#xD;
rate when she fell into his power. Not ai hv-&#xD;
ing soul from her greeted the approach of the&#xD;
man-of-war, and Allen was too eager in his&#xD;
chase to pause to board her. That he left for&#xD;
his slower-sailing consorts to do. But he ran&#xD;
so close that he and his crew could see the&#xD;
dead bodies of the butchered men, who had&#xD;
composed the crew of the unfortunate vessel,&#xD;
and more than one oath was reistered to&#xD;
avenge the 'hapless creatures.&#xD;
The breeze grew fresher as the vessels stood&#xD;
off, and they soon had all they could do to&#xD;
carry top-gallant sails with "a clear full " on,&#xD;
and the white caps danced merrily on the&#xD;
crests of the huge blue waves.&#xD;
From time to time Allen sighted the dis-&#xD;
tance between the two vessels with his sextant,&#xD;
to see if he gained ; and frequently was he&#xD;
tempted to fire a challenging gun'to wind-&#xD;
ward, to try and taunt his foe into bringing to&#xD;
for battle. But he wished, so long as lie could,&#xD;
to keep the latter from becoming aware that&#xD;
he had good powder on l1oard; and as he was&#xD;
very fast dropping his consorts astern, he&#xD;
hoped every hour to see the pirate heave to&#xD;
and give him a chance to close.&#xD;
But night was fast approaching, and lie be-&#xD;
gan to fear that the'wily villain intended in-&#xD;
(Ieed to fly, and in the coming darkness might&#xD;
escape, when, while yet the sun was an half&#xD;
hour or more high, and the rails of his con-&#xD;
sorts almost out of sight astern, the pirate was&#xD;
seen to take in his top-gallantsail, biil up his&#xD;
foresail, and make a show of preparation for&#xD;
action, by running off with the wind a little&#xD;
free.&#xD;
Cheers broke from the lips of the American&#xD;
crew when they saw this, for they felt that the&#xD;
ong-desired hour was now at hand.&#xD;
"Oh, for a few hours more of daylight!"&#xD;
muttered Allen, to himself, as lie glanced at&#xD;
the height of the sun.&#xD;
"She will be ours before dark, sir I" ! d&#xD;
the first lieutenant, who had overheard his ex-&#xD;
pression.&#xD;
"Perhaps-but if she tries yet to escape&#xD;
us, the coming darkness will favor her. Her&#xD;
escape is all that I fear !" replied Allen.&#xD;
Still standing can under a press of canvas,&#xD;
the Alligator was soon within gunshot of the&#xD;
pirate ; and then Allen began to trim in"his&#xD;
canvas for work. The enemy did not opens&#xD;
fire, undoubtedly waiting for Allen to try his&#xD;
poor powder first ; but the latter determining&#xD;
to hide the advantage which he knew lie had,&#xD;
held his fire also ; and just as the sun began&#xD;
to dip beneath the western waters, ranged&#xD;
along the weather-beam of the pirate,. and+&#xD;
within hailing distance.&#xD;
Colcefrinas, dressed magnificently, stood'on.&#xD;
the weather-rail of his vessel, and hailing,'said':&#xD;
"I am waiting for you to open the ballwith,&#xD;

OUI MESS; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
TIHE PIRATE-IUNTERS OF THE GULF.&#xD;
&#xD;
Allen, and at a wave of his hand, to the utter&#xD;
astonishment of the pirate, a crashing broad-&#xD;
sie was poured into him, of shot not sent by&#xD;
Mzatanas powder.&#xD;
"Hell aind furies! .l)e Regla has played me&#xD;
fihise !" shouted Colcefrinas,as he sprung to&#xD;
the helm himself, to put it hard-a-lee, to save&#xD;
his vessel from being raked by the American,&#xD;
which was wearing around his stern, while the&#xD;
umn were hurriedly reloading the batteries&#xD;
jut firedd"&#xD;
And the pirates, who, taken altogether by&#xD;
surprise, at first were panic-struek, now sprung&#xD;
to their guns ; and on both sides the firing be-&#xD;
came hot and lieavy&#xD;
And now the skill of the two commanders,&#xD;
as well as their bravery, was brought into&#xD;
play. Allen, finding that he could not so ma-&#xD;
nouvre as to rake his wily foe, sought to make&#xD;
the conlict brief by boarding him. But Col-&#xD;
refrinas, much as lie would have desired it had&#xD;
his crew been full, had lost too many men in&#xD;
the storm, and in the unexpected broadside,&#xD;
to risk a hand-to-hand encounter; and he only&#xD;
sought to hold his own until night set in,&#xD;
that lie aight escape in the darkness. Pass-&#xD;
ing forward among his gunners the order to&#xD;
cripple the American in his spars, he nianaged&#xD;
by skillful manouvres to buffle Allen in every&#xD;
attempt to getalongside. The gunners of the&#xD;
Alligator, only thinking of sending as many&#xD;
pirates as they could to eternity, poured in&#xD;
their grape and canister, and it was not until&#xD;
it was too late that Allen found that only&#xD;
round and chain shot were returned, to knock&#xD;
sway his spurs and cut his rigging.&#xD;
Darkness had come on, although from the&#xD;
veryP commencement of the action both vessels&#xD;
hid been in the darkness of a cloud of smoke,&#xD;
when suddenly the lime of the pirate ceased-&#xD;
although it had been tremendously heavy&#xD;
until the very instant before it stopped.&#xD;
"She has surrendered !" shouted many a&#xD;
voice on board the American; and more than&#xD;
one dying tar lifted his head to hear those&#xD;
words-more than one man sorely wounded&#xD;
ceased his groans, as they heard the cry.&#xD;
But poor Allen, who though twice wound-&#xD;
ed would not leave the deck, gnashed his&#xD;
teeth in very anger at this silence, for he knew&#xD;
that his almost conquered foe was creeping&#xD;
away from him under cover of the night. And&#xD;
the  reports which came to him of crippled&#xD;
spars told him that he could not, even could&#xD;
he see his enemy, pursue him, until new spars&#xD;
had been sent up, others secured, and new rig-&#xD;
giugg rove,.&#xD;
The crew could hardly realize, in the utter&#xD;
silence which succeeded the thunder of broad-&#xD;
sides, and the yells of fierce combatants, that&#xD;
their enemy had crept off; and it was long be-&#xD;
fore they would believe it-long before they&#xD;
eyesed to look for the flash of his guns, or to&#xD;
listen for sounds betokening that he Was in&#xD;
the vicinity. It seemed impossible that he&#xD;
could have gone off so still.&#xD;
&#xD;
The loss of the Alligator in amen was not&#xD;
near so great in the action as would have been&#xD;
supposed, when she had been almost yard-arm&#xD;
and yard-arm in action for a half hour or&#xD;
more - but the very means taken to cripple&#xD;
her spars, saved her men?&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
The Alligator once more lay at an anchor&#xD;
in the bay from whence she sailed before her&#xD;
combat with Coleefrinas, as described last. It&#xD;
had been necessary for her to run in to repair&#xD;
damages, but her consorts were actively croi-&#xD;
ing outside, and she soon expected to join them,&#xD;
and Allen yet hoped to test the prowess of the&#xD;
pirate chief in another combat.&#xD;
Allen was below with O'Shaughnessy look-&#xD;
ing over his daily report of the wounded and&#xD;
sick, and hearing his verbal statement of their&#xD;
condition, when a messenger front the officer&#xD;
of the deck announced that a boat had shown&#xD;
itself some way in land; with a white flag&#xD;
fying.&#xD;
"hoist a white flag, sir, at our fore to en-&#xD;
courage the boat to conic on board, and if it&#xD;
comes, assure its crew that their flag shall be&#xD;
re1sected!r" said the young commander. "I&#xD;
will be on deck in a moment !"&#xD;
"Whew! I wonder what'll be done next by&#xD;
the murthern' spalpeens !" said O'Shaugh-&#xD;
nessy. "They're like that sort o' Christians&#xD;
that sare the Lord of a Sunday, and onlid&#xD;
Nick the rest o' the week 1"&#xD;
"how do you make that out, doctor?"&#xD;
asked Allen, with a smile.&#xD;
" Why sure, cap's dear, haven't they been&#xD;
a wearin' the black flag all the while, and now&#xD;
raise the white one for convaynience. 1 hope&#xD;
they're wanting a doctor to cure their big thafe&#xD;
o' a leader !"&#xD;
"Would you volunteer, doctor?"&#xD;
"Only let 'em try me once, sir !" said the&#xD;
doctor with a look that indicated a desire to do&#xD;
something desperate-but as it was directed&#xD;
toward the brandy-decanter oitmthe side-board,&#xD;
A llen invited him to take something to drink)&#xD;
wie' he did without any apparent reluctance.&#xD;
When Allen reached the deck, the boat with&#xD;
the white xlag had already been-alongside, and&#xD;
leaving a young man on the deck, had instantly&#xD;
shoved off, and pulled away.&#xD;
"What does this mean, and why did not the&#xD;
boat remain ?" asked Allen of the officer of the&#xD;
deck.&#xD;
"I know not, sir, perhaps this young man&#xD;
can explain-but I see that he is blindfolded,&#xD;
perhaps he is a released captive l"&#xD;
"Few of their captives are released but by&#xD;
the hand of Death .' said Allen, as the sup-&#xD;
posed young man, finding himself free, tore off&#xD;
the bandage from before his eyes with his own&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
A low cry of surprise broke from the lips of&#xD;
the stranger, and Allen who had little expected&#xD;
such a meeting, or such pleasure, cried, inms-&#xD;
tonishment:&#xD;
&#xD;
" Ieavens !You, senorita-you here, and&#xD;
irm fromtl the por of Colceefinias ?"&#xD;
r.im-uita ie Rerla-it could be none other&#xD;
-ave him one look, then as if struck down&#xD;
1-v tie suddenness of her joy, fell senseless to&#xD;
tie deeek.&#xD;
Allen, heedless of all but her, caught her up&#xD;
in lir  ii arms, and bore her into'the cabin,&#xD;
ealling to Doctor O'Shaughnessy to follow him.&#xD;
")o all von can to restore her, sir-do it&#xD;
quickly !" he said, as he laid hist fair burden&#xD;
down upon the cushioned transom seat.&#xD;
"is it a ier, cap'n, and in boy's clothes,&#xD;
too ? Slie's miighty purty for a pirate !"&#xD;
"Silence, sir, I wish no observations, but the&#xD;
muse of your skill, sir !"&#xD;
' Tien, eap'n, if you plaze, either take off&#xD;
heu jacket, or else rip up the slave of it-it's&#xD;
bladm n' cr I'd be after doin' !' said the doe.&#xD;
tor, rattier testily, for he did nat fancy either&#xD;
thme eammtin's words or tone to him.&#xD;
' She must not be bled-where is your sal&#xD;
voh itile---here, steward, bring me some wine&#xD;
dud water I Bear a hand with them !"&#xD;
hlie doctor was about again to urge the ine-&#xD;
cessity of his favorite practice-bleeding, when&#xD;
the p) girl opened her eyes, and began to&#xD;
recover without aid. Allen placed sone wine&#xD;
and water to her lips, and as the flush of re-&#xD;
turiiiig strength came out upon her cheek, he&#xD;
turned to the doctor and said&#xD;
 I cm dispense with your services now, doe-&#xD;
tor! If I spoke too harshly, exese me-I was&#xD;
,exti'umely alarmed for the safety of the lady !"&#xD;
Ahm, eap'n dean, a rough word from  you&#xD;
would never fray the silken cord o' f h-indship&#xD;
tat hinds me to you. Deuce the bit. If the&#xD;
young lady, sir, should feel nervous, if you'll&#xD;
take my poor advice, a drop of smooth ouild&#xD;
barily would set her all right. I've some tip-&#xD;
top f mat I got from onld'Mother Mallony i&#xD;

hiomelf out of the cabin.&#xD;
"Teil me h-ow you escaped, dear lady, and&#xD;
hy what strange good fort mie I have the hap-&#xD;
liiiess to recieve you here !" asked Allen, the&#xD;
moment that lie was left alone with the lady.&#xD;
a Seior, I scarcely kno w. I was his cap-&#xD;
tive--anm free ;but why I became free, I ant iot&#xD;
fully certain, But I believe the jealousy of a&#xD;
ii    m nss or wife af his has been the happy&#xD;
cause.  Whatever it was, I bless Ieaven that&#xD;
1 am  free and safe, for beneath your flag I&#xD;
know I will be protected!"&#xD;
With my life, and that of every one on&#xD;
la) wh, dear lady. But when did you see this&#xD;
mole-r-can you give inc Io directions by&#xD;
whmoh I may trace him to his haunts,and there&#xD;

\Vould to Heaven that I could !" said Ma-&#xD;
raquita. I have not seen hint for three or four&#xD;
dae and then lie onhaid inc a visit to taunt&#xD;
m- wit hiIis threats, saying that in three days&#xD;
to s wamId ha your head, and then force me to&#xD;
tieu'cegne his bride. He swore that you were iii&#xD;
Ii s power, aid I trembled lest it was true "&#xD;
&#xD;
" He thought so, and by treachery I nearly&#xD;
lbecane so ; but he has learned his error,&#xD;
and i' has cost him deiry !" replied Allen-in&#xD;
generous kindness withholding the nature of&#xD;
the treachery by which he had so nearly fallen&#xD;
into the power of Colcefrinas. " But from&#xD;
whence came you to-day ?"&#xD;
From his main rendezvous, Ishouldjudge ;&#xD;
for from the .atticed blinds of a house where 1&#xD;
was kept some hours, I saw many vessels and&#xD;
men. During the night before I had been re-&#xD;
moved from a cave where he has collected im-&#xD;
niense treasures, and where he had me confined&#xD;
after I was taken with poor Captain Howard !''&#xD;
"Where is lie ?&#xD;
I know not. I have not seen him since the&#xD;
hour of my capture. I have not been carried&#xD;
anywhere without having my eyes bandaged !"&#xD;
"The place of rendezvous cannot b far from&#xD;
here !" said Allen, thoughtfully. " Have you&#xD;
an idea of the length of time they were engaged&#xD;
in bringing you here ?"&#xD;
Not inure than three or four hours, cer-&#xD;
tainly !"&#xD;
"''hen I will have this coast scoured o&#xD;
closely that it whereabouts cannot fail to !3e&#xD;
learned. That done, and the infamous wretches&#xD;
shall be exterminated ! But dear lady, how to&#xD;
make you comfortable will be my first thought.&#xD;
Should you desire to be sent to Matanzas-"&#xD;
1 I have no such desire, sir ! I fled from my&#xD;
father's house to escape his tyranny, and a&#xD;
forced union with a man whose crimes he&#xD;
knows, and the profits of which I fear he&#xD;
shares. But I know you are too noble and&#xD;
generous to use this belief of mine against&#xD;
him !"&#xD;
I would not harm him for the world, lady&#xD;
-if I wished, I have grave cause to do it. But&#xD;
for your sake I ignore that all ; and if you will&#xD;
give mc the bliss of becoming lawfully your&#xD;
protector, the moment that duty will permit, I&#xD;
will sail for a port where we can be united !"&#xD;
" The heart which has so long been yours,&#xD;
trusts to you entirely !" said the lady, frankly&#xD;
-for hers was not the nature, nor was she of a&#xD;
nation that is icy, or backward in expressing&#xD;
the strength of its passions.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
"Madre de Dios !   What, what does thi&#xD;
mean? Your vessel, with the evidences of re-&#xD;
cent combat in her pierced hull and sails,&#xD;
brought to an anchor in our port. in broad&#xD;
day-light ; and you, armed to the teeth, stalk&#xD;
through the town and into the palace, as if you&#xD;
were lord of both I"&#xD;
These words, half in anger, and half in ter-&#xD;
ror, were spoken by Don Garcia do Regla, to&#xD;
the pirate chief, soon after his escape from&#xD;
Allen. And it. was no wonder that the audacity&#xD;
and fear ess boldness of the pirate astonished&#xD;
as well as frightened Dc Regla. The fact that&#xD;
his was not a national vessel, though on this&#xD;
occasion she wore Spanish colors, must cone&#xD;

" I did not come here to answer questions,&#xD;
Garcia dc Regla, but to ask them!" said Colce-.&#xD;
frinas, stern's. "Why, did you give that infer-&#xD;
nal Yankee good powder?'&#xD;
"I did nqt ! lie was supplied with the&#xD;
damaged !"&#xD;
'"Garcia de Ieg'a, you need not lie to me&#xD;
"Lie?   Do you dare to use such language&#xD;
to me?"&#xD;
"Ay, worse than words! I have lost more&#xD;
than half my men by your treachery! I ran&#xD;
my vessel right under his broadside, and&#xD;
taunted him to fire, when my crew was already&#xD;
weakened by disaster, intending to cut him up&#xD;
at leisure, believing the word that you sent&#xD;
was true, and that his powder was worthless !"&#xD;
"The powder which I- furnished him was&#xD;
" The loss of more than half my men prove&#xD;
that!" said the pirate, bitterly.&#xD;
"Ne may have got powder elsewhere !" said&#xD;
d?)e Regln, who, for many reasons, wished not&#xD;
to excite the pirate more.&#xD;
"Impossible! lie has been in no port but&#xD;
this. It is your treachery. Garcia do Regla,&#xD;
E see through it all! You have tired of me&#xD;

"You are going too far, sir !" said the mar-&#xD;
uis; for Vastillian pride, as well as some na-&#xD;
tive courage, began to come back to his aid.&#xD;
"Were I but to breathe your name, or the&#xD;
oharacter of your vessel here-"&#xD;
"Well, what then ?" asked the pirate, with&#xD;
3 sneer.&#xD;
The marquis did not know what to say.&#xD;
"I would tell the people and the soldiers&#xD;
that their Intendente was my compaiero-that&#xD;
he was an old hand at the trade, and that if they&#xD;
didn't want their town burned up, they would&#xD;
beware how they angered Colcefrinas ! And&#xD;
the--they would tremble as you do now,&#xD;
Garcia do ReglaI!"&#xD;
"1 do not tremble, or if I do, it is with an-&#xD;
ger, not with fear!" said the old Spaniard.&#xD;
"A child's anger is not dangerous. But call&#xD;
insome wine, De Regla-I am thirsty ! I came&#xD;
hero hot, and you've said nothing to cool me&#xD;
yet!"&#xD;
"When will you leave this port ?" asked the&#xD;
marquis, not heeding the demand of the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
"When it so pleases me-not before. I&#xD;
called for wine. Will you order it, or shall I&#xD;

"I will order refreshments ; I would do that&#xD;

"I would run my vessel under the guns of&#xD;

"1«jake me ?"&#xD;
"Yes; or else drag you on board, and blow&#xD;

"Is my daughter on board of your vessel :'&#xD;
"Igo ; she is where she is treated like a&#xD;
queen, and will be, so long as she and her fa-&#xD;
thier behave properly. But I have not done&#xD;
with you in regard to that powder."&#xD;
"On my honor, I swear !--"&#xD;
" Tush !  Swear by something tangible--&#xD;
sa'mething that exists."&#xD;
"I tell you, by my honor as a Castilian-..&#xD;
by every tie that is binding on earth or in&#xD;
heaven, that I gave him the poor powder !"&#xD;
"Then he has made it good by some Yan-&#xD;
kee trick ; for 1 had all that I could do to es-&#xD;
cape him. had he been favored with an hour&#xD;
more of daylight, it would have been my last&#xD;
cruise !"&#xD;
hind the mar '% expressed the wish that&#xD;
was in his heart, it would have been, that Al-&#xD;
len had been favored with suflicient light to&#xD;
have put Colcefrinas out of his way forever,&#xD;
But lie did not ; and ordered wine and bran-&#xD;
dy from a servant who answered the bell he&#xD;
had rung.&#xD;
" You would like to know why I came a:&#xD;
here ?" said Colcefrinas, after he had tossed&#xD;
off a bumper of brtndy-iguorings the wine&#xD;
in its more potent presence.&#xD;
" I would."&#xD;
"I had to, to repair damage. 'lheYan..-&#xD;
kees, though they do not know it, are block-&#xD;
ading my main port-where, just now, all of&#xD;
my force is assembled. I must refit some-&#xD;
where ; and here was my best chance. I shalh&#xD;
pass as a Spanish privateer, which has been&#xD;
in action with a Mexican main-of--war - and.&#xD;
with your aig the matter can be carried out&#xD;
fery easily."&#xD;
"And you expect me to aid you in this do-&#xD;
ception?"&#xD;
"I do not only expect it, but I deniand it&#xD;
and you dare not refuel me !"&#xD;
-" I dare!h-if it costs my life, I dare !" said&#xD;
De Regis, taunted into desperation.&#xD;
"The future Governor-General of Cuba-&#xD;
perhaps Prime-Minister of Spain - iorgets&#xD;
himself !" said the pirate, sarcastically ;.e" and&#xD;
perhaps he also forgets certain bonds for&#xD;
government moneys squandered, which are&#xD;
held as a safe-guard by one who never trusted&#xD;
him beyond the length of a cLain-eable !"&#xD;
The marquis groaned; Ih i sew he was in&#xD;
the power of that bold, bad  an, and lie did&#xD;
not indeed dare to thwart his will.&#xD;
" If I consent, you will hasten you depart.&#xD;
ure, will you not ?" he asked, at last.&#xD;
"Of course I will, if you are reasonable. I&#xD;
have no desire to tarry long in port-I have&#xD;
too much work ahead, But I shall depend&#xD;
on you to answer the demands of my officers ;&#xD;
for. I must run down by the overland route,&#xD;
&#xD;
a'd see my me, .If you have a message to&#xD;
your daughter, I will bear it."&#xD;
" I wo ki rather you would bring her here !"&#xD;
said the marquis, sadly. "lre she will be&#xD;
safe-and you know not how dear to meo she&#xD;
is. I- did" not know, until her absence told&#xD;
inc !"&#xD;
"She shall come here only after she is my&#xD;
bride !" replied the pirate.  When these&#xD;
Yankees have been driven o'ff, and she isnmine,&#xD;
you shall see her decked and jewel td as a&#xD;
queen !"&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXXII.&#xD;

The sound of footsteps interrupted this wild&#xD;
soliloquy ; and Mariana, who uttered it, turn-&#xD;
ed toward the door of her glittering prison---&#xD;
well knowingr, by the hasty, heavy tread, who&#xD;
was approaching. A moinent iore, and he&#xD;
entered, urted as lie Lad been when he last&#xD;
stood in the pr sence of Garcia de tegla, but&#xD;
now coy, red with the dusty stains of hasty&#xD;
travel.;&#xD;
" Well, lady, I have brought you a message&#xD;
froni your father," said Coleefrinas. not recog.&#xD;
nizii the change of persons as he entered the&#xD;
lighted room. " I hope you will be thankful&#xD;
for it, and not attempt to carry your head&#xD;
quite so high as you did whes last I niet&#xD;
you !''?&#xD;
" I have dreamed that my father slept in a&#xD;
bloody grave !" said Mauiano, in the tone&#xD;
wlic'l he had heard froni Mariano's lips a&#xD;
thuso l times-a tone snot quite so rich, but&#xD;
a thousiul I tiles more deep iand thiri-nibg than&#xD;
that of o rdiniry women.&#xD;
'lhe pirate sprung forward and caught her&#xD;
by the arm, looked at her fiercely for a mo-&#xD;
metnt, and then cried:&#xD;
" how dare you, sir, to masquerade w:th&#xD;
me! I have allowed you too much liberty&#xD;
hitherto !  It shall he lessened materially.&#xD;
Where is the lady ?"&#xD;
I am the only lady here," was the reply,&#xD;
given in so low and street a tone, with down-&#xD;
cast eyes and a blush so natural, that Colce-&#xD;
frinas felt for an instant inclined to believe&#xD;
that a woman indeed stood before him ; but&#xD;
this he could not, for Mariano had from child-&#xD;
hooh served him, and lie had never doubted&#xD;
that he was a boy.&#xD;
A woman, with all of a woman's heart e.-&#xD;
cept her fears !" continued Mariano. And&#xD;
she drew her proud foi-m up, and looked so&#xD;
&#xD;
much like what heri mother had been when&#xD;
first she attracted his passion, that he re lead&#xD;
her arm and drew back.&#xD;
"You act well. But have done with this&#xD;
mummery ; I am not in a humor to be trifled&#xD;
with now, sir !" said the pirate. , "Where is&#xD;
the lady Maraquita, whom I left here ?"&#xD;
"That is more than I can tell: she is not&#xD;
here. When I came she went away."&#xD;
"Villain I have you aided her to escape ?"&#xD;
cried the chief, trembling with anger.    -&#xD;
"I exchanged garments with her, and she&#xD;
is free."&#xD;
"Curse you-you shall die for this I" shout-&#xD;
ed Coleefrinas, as he drew a pistol from his&#xD;
belt.&#xD;
Fire !" cried the excited girl, as she bold-&#xD;
ly tore open the silken robes, and revealed a&#xD;
spotless bosom, which all too well proclainied&#xD;
her sex. "Fire! and pierce a heart which&#xD;
for years, in silence an I sorrow, has throbbed&#xD;
only for you--dark, dark and sinful though it&#xD;
has been ! Why do you not fire ?"&#xD;
The hand of Colcefrinas fell powerless t.&#xD;
his side.&#xD;
" What does this mean ?" hle 'asked, trem&#xD;
bling. " Is it a miracle ? You are not the&#xD;
Mariano who for years have been near me-&#xD;
the Mariano whom I fou--d but a mere child&#xD;
wit its mother ?"&#xD;
I am that thild ! For reasons of her own&#xD;
which she may explain, butt eannnot, my&#xD;
mother has ever made me conceal nv sex un&#xD;
til now; and now, that it is revealed, -hsn&#xD;
Mariano ot longer, but MAinuaN-and stihl&#xD;
your slave !"&#xD;
And tearfully, timidly, she knelt, and tools&#xD;
his hand and kissed it.&#xD;
"So your mother is at the bottom of all&#xD;
this !" he said, thoughtfully. ' Andthen ho&#xD;
turned upon his heel and left the room ; while&#xD;
she s ill remained kneeling.&#xD;
She rose a moment after, and rushed to the&#xD;
door to follow hit: it was barred, and she&#xD;
yet- remained a prisoner.   With a low cry&#xD;
of anguish, idhe t :ned back ; and, easting&#xD;
herself down uponi the carpet-covered ground&#xD;
sobbed and wept as if her Ih at would break&#xD;
She was indeed a woman now.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
Ihe queenly manner, as well as the rare&#xD;
beauty of Monona, gave her much power&#xD;
among the lawless followers of Colcefriuas ;&#xD;
and regarding her as his wife,annd onee'lcvoted&#xD;
to him and his interests, in his absence they&#xD;
were in the habit pf obeying her comimantds,&#xD;
and in tunes of tlhratened peril of seeking her&#xD;
advice. When he had sailed in-the captured&#xD;
schooner on his last trip, -he had told her, as&#xD;
well as his followers, that if he was successful,&#xD;
he would be back in five days, anti then would&#xD;
lead them against the rest of their blockading&#xD;

too glad to have a chance to win their esteem, ever to be seen which escaped his observation.&#xD;
and to gail power amongst them (for she knew&#xD;
not howsoown she rghit need it), Monona-who&#xD;

there she led them. I                      dered.&#xD;
They had gathered together, ready for em-  " What is she or should be to you ?"&#xD;
barkation. And when Monona, dressed more     " For the third and last time, I ask you,&#xD;

But suddenly there was a hush ; and as Col-  "That were a dangerous experiment to try&#xD;

none.                     -                   Monona!," said he, more gently after a&#xD;
" Woman, your place is in the house ! Go pause, "youi are acting unwomaenmlike and fool-&#xD;
there--I have sons business to settle there cish!"&#xD;
with you directly."                          " Unwomnanlile, p'rhaps-hu-lt not with fol-&#xD;

&#xD;
be supplanted by another. Unwomanlilke, be-&#xD;
cause I dare to look with bitterness on the past,&#xD;
and to determine to right myself when my&#xD;
only protector rises to wrong me. Or do you&#xD;
mean that I was unwomanly when I armed to&#xD;
lead your men against your foes, and avenge&#xD;
your loss-if lost you were, as they feared and&#xD;
I almost hoped !"&#xD;
"Hoped, -Monona-hoped I was lost ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Eduardo-yes, better the loss of your&#xD;
life and mnmine, than to be awakened thus rudely&#xD;
from the dream of love which has made me so&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
And Monona's voice began to tremble and&#xD;
her eyes to moisten. Coleefrinasrsaw that the&#xD;
woman-nature wVas struggling to comie back,&#xD;
and with wily art he threw out a decoy to bring&#xD;
it further.&#xD;
"You have not lost soy love, Monona !" said&#xD;
he.&#xD;
" Why, then, did you seek to wed this I)e&#xD;
Regla's child ?"&#xD;
I did not mean to wed her. I held her as&#xD;
a hostage for her father's faith, for I had rea-&#xD;
son to doubt that ; and if we have no hold on&#xD;
the government officials, our homes here would&#xD;
soon be too hot to hold us. Besides, there&#xD;
would be no market for our plunder, were iot&#xD;
they our friends."&#xD;
" You need not try to deceive me, Eduardo.&#xD;
I have known your movements too long."&#xD;
"You do well to talk of deceit, madam, who&#xD;
have deceived me so long, and kept your daughc-&#xD;
ter as a spy ulpon ily motions."&#xD;
If you termn that deceit by which I have&#xD;
concealed her sex, I um willing to bear the&#xD;
blame of it. So far I have preserved her from&#xD;
the wrong which has wrapped me in shame ;&#xD;
and I hope I have given her a courage to pre-&#xD;
fer death to dishonor."&#xD;
A new thought-a new means to subdue the&#xD;
tigress temper before him, suddenly flashed, as&#xD;
all things had come, upon-his mind.&#xD;
"Do not think that I regret to have discov.&#xD;
cred your secret, or rather'to have learned the&#xD;
sex of your ehild. She is very pretty-very&#xD;
like what youonce were," said he, and a quiet&#xD;
smile stole over his cold face.&#xD;
Not new the jealous fears of a woman, but&#xD;
all of a mother's nature was aroused, and Mo-&#xD;
nona, pale as marble, threw herself at his feet.&#xD;
" Oh ! for the love of lIeaveh ! do not hint&#xD;
tiht she--s/cc, my child, will suffer wrong at&#xD;
your hands-! I know that no priestly lips&#xD;
have ever pronounced the nuptial benediction&#xD;
for us-but oh! have we not been as man and&#xD;
wife in the sight of Heaven for long, long years?&#xD;
Eduardo-Eduardo! speak ! You do not con-&#xD;
template this dreadful wrong ?"&#xD;
"Where isMaraquita do Regla ?" he softly&#xD;
asked, for he felt that Monona now would not&#xD;
refuse an answer.&#xD;
" She has gone on board of the American&#xD;
schooner, at anchor off the coast," sobbed the&#xD;
woman,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ten thousand curses on you! Have yout&#xD;
given her up to him-to my deadliest foe?&#xD;
hall he conquer me in everything? Off, wo-&#xD;
man ! cling not to me now-off!"&#xD;
And he cast her from him with a force that&#xD;
left her stunned and senseless on the floor.&#xD;
i did not pause to look at her, but sternly&#xD;
strode from the house. Meeting his principal&#xD;
officer, he asked:&#xD;
" What was the plan of the expedition which&#xD;
you were about to undertake when I returned,&#xD;
Solano ?"&#xD;
"A night attack upon the Yankees in Tor-&#xD;
tuga Bay, my chief. There are but three ves-&#xD;
sels; and if we took them unawares, we could&#xD;
kill every man or run them overboard !"&#xD;
"That is so. I have left the schooner in a&#xD;
friendly port to refit, and I would have liked&#xD;
to have had her crew in the fray. But it mat-&#xD;
ters not ; we have men enough, and the attack&#xD;
must be made in boats. Muster our forces at&#xD;
once, and tell them that we will take those&#xD;
Yankees this night, for I will lead the expedi-&#xD;
tion!"&#xD;
Ay, ny, sir ! It will be the best iews&#xD;
they've heard in a year.  low soon will we&#xD;
start, sir ?'&#xD;
" It will be dark within an hour-let all&#xD;
things be lpreparel within two. That will give&#xD;
us time to board them when they sleep the&#xD;
soundest in the nu(l-wateh ! Let the oars be&#xD;
muffled, and none but able men allowed to take&#xD;
an o'ir. This time we fight for safety and for&#xD;
revenge, not for profit."&#xD;
The officer hurried away to obey the orders&#xD;
of his chief, and the latter returned into his&#xD;
house, for he had.met the oilieer beneath the&#xD;
window, and but a step fromi the door.&#xD;
As he passed through the room where he&#xD;
had left poor Monoiia, 'he looked u)on the&#xD;
floor, but she was not there. She had recov-&#xD;
ered sufficiently to go from there. Ile went&#xD;
into the room where he usually sat, and where&#xD;
a sideboard was placed,ponm which stood de-&#xD;
canters of wine, brandy, etc. Of the last&#xD;
he took a brimming goblet, iiiuttering as he&#xD;
drank : "I will have her yet! Ilis life or&#xD;
mine this time."&#xD;
Where is your mistress, Lisa ?" he asked&#xD;
of servant, who entered.&#xD;
"She hasjust gone into her chamber, leior 1"&#xD;
replied the negress.&#xD;
" It is well! That is the best place for her,"&#xD;
muttered the fierce man. And he woninto his&#xD;
armory to prepare himself better fr lie even-&#xD;
ing's work.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
By good fortune Allen had several trunks of&#xD;
clothing on board, which had been taken from&#xD;
a vessel partially robbed, and deserted by&#xD;
pirates ; and in a short time, by the aid of these,&#xD;
the lady Maraquita was enabled to robe herself&#xD;

TIE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF THE GULF.&#xD;
&#xD;
less delicate about introducing her to his offi-&#xD;
cers than he would have been had she been&#xD;
forced to appear in her male attire. And lie&#xD;
wished to introduce her ; for lie deemed it ne-&#xD;
cessary to call a council of the chief officers of&#xD;
the little squadron together, and to give them&#xD;
information of the evident vicinity of a large&#xD;
rendezvous of the pirates, as was proven by her&#xD;
recent adventure.&#xD;
The council was held ; and it was there de-&#xD;
termined on the morrow to start a large boat-&#xD;
expedition, which was narrowly to search&#xD;
every portion of the adjacent coast, and to&#xD;
penetrate any inlets, bays, or rivers which they&#xD;
inlght find. As it was evident, too, that there&#xD;
was danger of a surprise when a large body of&#xD;
inc were so near, additional look-outs were&#xD;
ordered, and it was agreed to hoist the board-&#xD;
ing nettings alter dark, and adopt other usual&#xD;
nrecautions. As the vessels lay anchored&#xD;
almost load and stern in a line in the narrow&#xD;
bay, their defence if attacked would be united,&#xD;
while it would extend the attacking force. The&#xD;
precautions were taken not because the Amer-&#xD;
icans believed the pirates would really have&#xD;
the audacity to attack an armed force, hut be-&#xD;
cause it was their duty to provide against its&#xD;
possibility rather than its probability.&#xD;
The night was dark ; had it been moonlight,&#xD;
Allen would have doubtless asked the lady of&#xD;
his love to promenade the deck, now deserted&#xD;
by all but the ofheer of the watch and the&#xD;
usual andh r-guard---for in no climate in the&#xD;
world are moonlight promenades more de-&#xD;
licious than in that flowery land. As it was,&#xD;
though, the hours flew on uncounted until af-&#xD;
ter the mniight watch had been changed,&#xD;
Allen and Maeaquita remained in the after-&#xD;
cabin of the schooner, conversing, for neither&#xD;
felt like parting, even for sluiber.&#xD;
Suddenly the hail of a sentinel was heard,&#xD;
shouting, boat ahoy !"&#xD;
An answer was given in Spanish, and Allen&#xD;
hurried to the decl;, for he felt almost intuit-&#xD;
ively that it must be something serious to&#xD;
bring a boat on board at that time of night.&#xD;
On a second hail, asking where the boat was&#xD;
from, and what she waited, at the same time&#xD;
warning her not to approach without pernis-&#xD;
sioni was granted, a female voice replied&#xD;
erie to save you from surprise and&#xD;
destruction! For your own sakes let me see&#xD;
your cominimander, instantly&#xD;
Allen gave t ie order, and in a few moments&#xD;
the boat was alongside, and lie assisted a fe-&#xD;
male over the side, whose form was concealed&#xD;
as well as sheltered from the night air by a&#xD;
large cloak.&#xD;
Which is your carptaim? let inc see him&#xD;
alone, instantly!" she said.&#xD;
" Come into t he cabin, madam !" said the&#xD;
young officer. Then bidding the officer of the&#xD;
deck detain the boat in which she came until&#xD;
further orders, he preceded her into that apart-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Whom have I the honor of addressing, and&#xD;
what may the news be you have to impart ?"&#xD;
asked Allen, as he motioned the stranger to a&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
"That lady knows I am- I was - the&#xD;
slave of Colcefrinas, until his treachery and&#xD;
brutal treatment forced me to desperation and&#xD;
revenge. At the risk of my life I have come from&#xD;
his rendezvous with a faithful boat's crew, who&#xD;
are sworn to my service. He will attack your&#xD;
vessels within an hour, with at least one thou-&#xD;
sand men, hoping to take you utterly by sur-&#xD;
prise. If you repulse him you shall see me&#xD;
again-if you slay him, and will let me have&#xD;
enough to make me and my child independ-&#xD;
ent in some far off land where we are unknown,&#xD;
and guarantee us protection until we are free&#xD;
from  this region, I will disclose the hiding-&#xD;
place of his treasures. Now let me go, for I&#xD;
must return and avoid his boats, or C am lost !"&#xD;
" Can I trust in what this lady says '" asked&#xD;
Allen of Maraquita.         -&#xD;
I think you can. Her hand gave me my&#xD;
freedom!" said the seinorita.&#xD;
"Lady, would you not be safer to remain&#xD;
here ?" lie asked of Monona. " 'ilus forewarn-&#xD;
ed, we can easily repulse those who attack us.&#xD;
and afterward I can better serve you, prhnapsm!"&#xD;
I prefer to return, sedor-ny c li Id may&#xD;
be in danger ; fom she is yet a prisoner, in place&#xD;
of this lady !"&#xD;
" It shall be as you wish. And you have my&#xD;
thanks for this wrning!"&#xD;
" I need no thanks, sciior! I avenge myself&#xD;
in warning you. But, beware, be is even now&#xD;
near!"&#xD;
She waited no longer, but was gone in a mo-&#xD;
ment. Allen saw her over the side, and then&#xD;
hastened to send word to his colleagues to pre.&#xD;
pare for the impending attack, and lhinmselfsu-&#xD;
peinitended the acessary operations.  The&#xD;
broadsides of the vessels were sprung so as to&#xD;
completely cover the entrane of the hay-&#xD;
the guns were depressed so as 10o sweep the&#xD;
surface of the watter within pistol-shot-they&#xD;
were loaded to the nmzzle with grape-shot and&#xD;
bags of musket-balls-all of the sill-arms&#xD;
were changed, and the crews of the guns sta-&#xD;
tioned. All the lights, except those usually&#xD;
shown by vessels at anchor, were put out, and&#xD;
the strictest silence enjoined, so that those who&#xD;
intended to surprise miight believe in their sue-&#xD;
cess until it was time to turn the tables on&#xD;
them.&#xD;
The men and ofileers had ben at their&#xD;
stations an hour at least-it seemed lon-er, for&#xD;
suspense hangs weights to the wings of Time---&#xD;
and as yet no sound of the expected enemy&#xD;
was heard.&#xD;
"I shouldn't wonder if that woman had de-&#xD;
cieved us, and had only conie as a spy to see&#xD;
whether we were prepared or not !" said his&#xD;
first lieutenant to Allen, as the Ia ter leaned&#xD;
against the quarter-rail in a listening attitude.&#xD;
" hush--I hear the low dip of oars 1- Be&#xD;
&#xD;
x&#xD;
r,&#xD;
&#xD;
ready to throw up the blue lights the moment&#xD;
I give the worJ!" was Allen's low reply.     1&#xD;
f To other ears t an those of one who watched&#xD;
anxiously w.th tie hope of Paine in his heart,&#xD;
thesoui is would have been inaudible, but&#xD;
soon they beeaue so dist inet that at almost&#xD;
the same mitoiment the. look-outs of the threeI&#xD;
vessels hailed.&#xD;
At that instant, a shower of rockets and blue&#xD;
lights thrown up from Allen's vessel lighted&#xD;
the little bay up with the glare of day, showing&#xD;
its entrance illiel with  boats which were&#xD;
stealthily pll)ing toward the me:.els-- boats&#xD;
crowded with m'rmmed ien.&#xD;
Ihitherto teIy hail heen silent as death, but&#xD;
now, seeing thaiely were discovered, owth wild&#xD;
yells and m naddening hiouts they dashed toward&#xD;
the vessels.&#xD;
The guns scarce needed sighting ;and in a&#xD;
minute, w ith one terrific s hee of fire-one&#xD;
earth-aid-acan-shakiing  sonI, the united&#xD;
broadsides sen  the r freight of ironand lead&#xD;
among the miserable wriethes. While yet the&#xD;
wild echoes rolled from isle to isle, the erash&#xD;
of splintere 1Iboats, the shriekis of dyiing men,&#xD;
and the hubbling gronis of drowning ones rent&#xD;
the air. ThaieInhvoci nis terriile, vet it did not&#xD;

men. More oats were n'rowrding into the bay,&#xD;
and these, with  hise wi haiebt had aeseaped the&#xD;

they did not--their loss had been too g:'eat for&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
When Colcfrinas was borne into his cham-&#xD;
esr, at the rendezvous, by sonime of his now-&#xD;
disheartened men, Monona, with mock-sym-&#xD;
pathy upon her lips and in her face, was the&#xD;
tirst to tender henrassistancec-fo'r she had re-&#xD;
turned undiscovered, and none but thsse who&#xD;
were imh the secret knew. Crowning more' with&#xD;
bitterness of hioart than with the ain of his&#xD;
wounds, Coleef'rins hsade lier  ave him, rudely&#xD;
refusing her assistance. And ms soon as hs&#xD;
surgeon had attendeid to his wounds, hlie or-&#xD;
dered a council of his chief others to a-em-&#xD;
ble.&#xD;
" There has been treason at work somewhere&#xD;
among ourselves '' said th. " If the r nkHes&#xD;

upon us ! It is evident that there must be&#xD;
son one among us who is alise!"&#xD;
The others assented to this-limit to discover&#xD;
the traitor or traitors was th thing to be ne-&#xD;
complished.&#xD;
" Who among you will desert me ?" asked&#xD;
the wounded pirate.&#xD;
" Not one-we will die with you, but never&#xD;
desert you!" wa the unanimon's reply.&#xD;
The chief smiled a ghastly smile,, for he was&#xD;
suffering all the while.&#xD;
"I had expected   hais devotion!" lie said.&#xD;
3ut you do not understand mie. I want a&#xD;
volunteer who will lesert---under a flag of&#xD;
truce deliver hninmself into the hands of the&#xD;
Yankees, and under the pledge of iarlon and&#xD;
protection, agree to not is a pilot for them.&#xD;
He can gain their confidenimce by leading them&#xD;
to some of our long-shore baoat-stations, from&#xD;
which our men, forewarned, many escape to the&#xD;
hills, and he can discover who the traitor is that&#xD;
has been so nearly our ruin, and who will be our&#xD;
destruction. without he is diseovere d and pmi-&#xD;

A little rape among them would benefit the&#xD;
world in general, I believe.&#xD;
"I will not send any one, for the duty is as&#xD;
unpleasant as it is full of risk!" said Colce-&#xD;
frinas.&#xD;
And then his face brightened, as a new idea&#xD;
seemed to strike him. He dismissed all of his&#xD;
*      officers, except two in whom he confided more&#xD;
than all the rest. To one he said : "You will&#xD;
see that the lady Monona is, during the rest of&#xD;
the day and night, confined strictly to her&#xD;
chamber. Let her have communication with&#xD;
no one outside. To-morrow, I care not where&#xD;
she goes !"&#xD;
To the other he confided a inc sage in a&#xD;
whisper, only adding, at the close, in a louder&#xD;
tone, "If she consents, bring her here quickly&#xD;
-if not, let her renuin until I will is other--&#xD;
wise!"                                 '&#xD;
Trie officer bowed and hurried away, while&#xD;
his comrade went for a guard to carry out the&#xD;
other order of his chief.&#xD;
This plan will work, I think, muttered the&#xD;
chief, and exliasted with his exertions, he&#xD;
sunk back upon his couch to rest.&#xD;
CIIAPTERt XXXVII.&#xD;
Mariana, left hopeless by the sudden depart-&#xD;
ure of Colcefrinas, pined even more rapidly&#xD;
than did poor Maraquila, when she had no&#xD;
hope of relief before her, and feared a fate&#xD;
more dreadful than death. Ier heart had not&#xD;
been schooled to reverses, and her nature&#xD;
taught to bend and vield, rather than to resist!&#xD;
and break. Alt ! this is a hard world to learn,&#xD;
aid one is apt to die just when lie lis got&#xD;
fairly schooled in its bitter lessons.&#xD;
Mtariana ssat moody ad listless in the splen-&#xD;
dor of her prison, 'when again the sound of&#xD;
footsteps feIl upon her ear, and she heard the&#xD;
door untbiarred.  But she did not raise her&#xD;
owed head from the table whereon it rested,&#xD;
foi she knew that they were not his footsteps&#xD;
which she heard-that he was not the one wto&#xD;
approached.&#xD;
"1 bear a message from Ooleefrinas to Ma-&#xD;
riana !" said the person who stood before her.&#xD;
She knew the voice, and quickly raised her&#xD;
great black eves, mind anxiously scanned his&#xD;
face, as if she would read- there his tidins&#xD;
before he spake them.&#xD;

" My instructions ,ere, if I found you vil-&#xD;

Mariana made no objections. She was but&#xD;
too glad to leave her trisot-oo glad to go to&#xD;
hit for whont she felt a love as wild and deep&#xD;
as it was strange and unnatural.&#xD;
She stood by his side, blushing and trem-&#xD;

lie, still faint and weak  omt t he loss of bl od,&#xD;
wt-as ale pale, ut he never hld looked so noble&#xD;

"These Yankees have been too much for&#xD;

" I can and will, faithfully, if I lose my life&#xD;
in carrying out your wishes. I have no desire&#xD;
but to serve you, no wish but to live and die&#xD;
near you !"&#xD;
"We will never be long separated, Mariana!"&#xD;
said the wily pirate. " If we but succeed in&#xD;
driving these pests away, I intend to gather&#xD;
together my treasure, and to go far, far front&#xD;
here, I have seen enough of peril and of&#xD;
bloodshed ! Your young days have been&#xD;
dark ones, in future you shall see sunshine !"&#xD;
The impassioned girl knelt by his bedside,&#xD;
and covered his hands with glad tears and&#xD;
kisses,&#xD;
It seemed strange, even to Colcefrinas, that&#xD;
during all this time she did not ask for her&#xD;
mother. But she seemed to have but one&#xD;
thought-one feeling-to know of, or to care&#xD;
to know of, but one being on earth.&#xD;
" When shall I go, my master ?" she asked,&#xD;
as she arose to her feet.&#xD;
"As soon as night mantles the sky, my love.&#xD;
Take my own light skiff, which 1 will have&#xD;
prepared for you. You will easily find the&#xD;
Americans. They are at anchor in Tortuga&#xD;
Bay, When you have learned all you can, and&#xD;
found out who it is that has betrayed us,&#xD;
hasten to my side. They will not watch you,&#xD;
and escape will be easy. in the meantime, do&#xD;
not speak to a soul here. Your mother is in&#xD;
her apartment, and not verj well. But I do&#xD;
not wish her to know that you are here !"&#xD;
"If my master will permit, I will remain by&#xD;
his side until it is time for me to start !"&#xD;
You surely shall have your wish, my good&#xD;
Mariana! I low strange that I should not have&#xD;
discovered your sex before ! You are very,&#xD;
very beautiful&#xD;
So well was the entrance to the rendezvous&#xD;
of the pirates concealed, that the boats of the&#xD;
Amer can expedition rowed by within less&#xD;
than two hundred yards of it, and did not&#xD;
discover it, on the day after their successful&#xD;
repulse of the pirates.  And though they&#xD;
hunted up and down the coast for some&#xD;
leagues to the eastward and westward of their&#xD;
anchorage, they discovered nothing of note.&#xD;
When Allen returned to his vessel at night,&#xD;
he was weary and disappointed, for he had&#xD;
felt confident that he would discover the main&#xD;
nest of the gang, and completely break them&#xD;
up. But he found a visitor who brought to&#xD;
him news that was far from unimportant  it&#xD;
was none other than the American Consul&#xD;
front Matanzas, in person, who came to de-&#xD;
scribe the suspicious-looking schooner which&#xD;
was refitting in that port as a Spanish priva-&#xD;
teer, and which he believed to be a pirate.'&#xD;
From the consul's description, Allen had no&#xD;
doubt but that she was his late antagonist,&#xD;
and his first thought was to sail at mace and&#xD;
capture her. But he knew that Coleefrinas'&#xD;
was not in her, f r he had recognized him in&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
the night attack, and hoped that he was slain&#xD;
for twice, with an almost unerring rile, he had&#xD;
fired at hint, as he believed, with good aim.&#xD;
The consul had also learned that near a week&#xD;
would pass before the schooner would be&#xD;
ready for sea, and Allen, therefore, determined&#xD;
to spend a day or two more in his search for&#xD;
the pirates, for he knew that they must be&#xD;
somewhere near. While he was conversing&#xD;
with the consul and Maraquita, a messenger&#xD;
from the officer of the deck announced that a&#xD;
boat with a single person, and that a woman,&#xD;
had come alongside, not having been seen un-&#xD;
til she was within a few feet of the gangway.&#xD;
"If so poor a watch is kept as that, we are&#xD;
never safe from surprise.!" said Allen, angrily.&#xD;
"have the woman brought into the cabin,&#xD;
and double the watch. It is doubtless the&#xD;
same who forewarned us of the night attack.&#xD;
She promised to return."&#xD;
Wien the messenger returned, bringing&#xD;
Mariana instead of her mother, Allen was&#xD;
greatly surprised, and Maraquita uttering a&#xD;
cry of joy, hastened to embrace her, for she&#xD;
felt that to her, principally, she owed her free-&#xD;
dom. flurried inquiries were made, and re-&#xD;
plies given, between the two females, by which&#xD;
Allen learned that Mariana, fearing that Col-&#xD;
eefrinas would slay her, had escaped, and fled&#xD;
to his vessel for protection. She had not seen&#xD;
her mother, but had heard of the night-attack,&#xD;
and that Colcefrinas was badly wounded.&#xD;
And to her utter astonishment, Mariana now&#xD;
learned that her mother had been the one who&#xD;
had warned the Americans of the intended at-&#xD;
tack-to her agony we may add, for she had&#xD;
sworn to Coleefrinas that she would find out&#xD;
and reveal the traitor, whoever it might be.&#xD;
She knew how wild and jealous was her mo-&#xD;
ther's disposition, but she had not dreamed&#xD;
that it would lead her to be false to those with&#xD;
whom she had dwelt so many years, and to&#xD;
bin whom she had so wildly loved.&#xD;
It must be remembered- that Morkana,&#xD;
reared from childhood amongst these des-&#xD;
perate people, did not look upon piracy as a&#xD;
crime, and regard it with an eye of horror,&#xD;
but thought more of it as an honorable war-&#xD;
fare, in which all that was taken was a prize to&#xD;
the victor. Was not all the world against her&#xD;
people, and were they not right to prey upon&#xD;
the world ? She thought so, and knew no&#xD;
better. Who could lame her?&#xD;
After hearing all that Mariana had to say&#xD;
about liver escape, and also of the damage which&#xD;
the pirate had sustained in the night-attack,&#xD;
Allen began gently to ask how the pirates&#xD;
were situated.&#xD;
Mariana now had her most difficult task to&#xD;
perform. Womanlike she appeared to fear-to&#xD;
attempt to pilot the Americans to the strong-&#xD;
hold of the pirates, and sie also said they had&#xD;
several. And she so greatly exaggerated&#xD;
their numube:s, that Allen believing al she&#xD;
said, felt that it would be folly with his force&#xD;

vent their marauding (xeirsioins, and finally&#xD;
to harass them into leaving those waters for-&#xD;
ever, or else utterly to destroy them. And he&#xD;
forebore that evening to push his inquiries or&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
"I am truly obliged to your serene highness&#xD;
for permission once more to stand in your&#xD;
presence," said Monona, no kingly, to Colce-&#xD;
frinas, wh -, after finding the guard removed&#xD;
from her door, she hal ventured from her&#xD;
chamber to that in which lie lay.&#xD;
" I did not anit to be annoyed by your&#xD;

were not of a sertols nature, and my recovery&#xD;
likely to be retarded by a woman who no&#xD;

"And whom you never loved, you might as&#xD;
well have added."&#xD;
"You can have it so if it pleases you, iiad-&#xD;

" I will. I am sorry that you are likely to&#xD;

" No, sir ; yet anot her !"&#xD;

shore, sce was to be kept concealed from her;&#xD;
&#xD;
THE PIRATE-HUNTERS OF THE GULF.          61&#xD;
&#xD;
nor was her mother to be informed of her es-&#xD;
cape. The reason she gave for this was, that&#xD;
her mother was of a variable and fickle nature,&#xD;
and in her anger so careless, that she might&#xD;
etray her whereabouts to Coleefrinas ; and&#xD;
Mariana seemed to fear him as if le were sonic&#xD;
demon possessed of more than mortal powi r.&#xD;
And well for Mariana's plans was it that she&#xD;
had made this request ; for, on the evening&#xD;
following that of her arrival on board, her&#xD;
mother came as before'- and this time for the&#xD;
purpose of betraying the pirate-chieftain in&#xD;
his stronghold. Shebrought to Allen a draw-&#xD;
ing of the rendezvous bav, and a chart of the&#xD;
entrance, drawn with her' own hand ; but she&#xD;
did not disclose the hiding-place of the trea-&#xD;
sure - determined, probably, to keep that&#xD;
knowledge for hier own benefit, for the time,&#xD;
at least.&#xD;
Mariana, from na state-room close at hand,&#xD;
heard all this ; and she could scarcely conceal&#xD;
her feelings from Maraquita, who remained&#xD;
with her. it may be imagined that, with her&#xD;
own feelings for Coleefrinas, she had not loved&#xD;
her mother very deeply before ; but now she&#xD;
felt for her no feeling of affection, and only&#xD;
wanted a chance to escape from the vessel,&#xD;
and expose her in time to save her chief and&#xD;
his band from the effects of her betrayal.&#xD;
With almost tremulous eagerness, she heard&#xD;
her mother agree to have a small beacon-light&#xD;
.placed outside the entrance to the bay of ren-&#xD;
dezvoy's on the next night, and thus to aid the&#xD;
Americans in their descent upon the band. In&#xD;
regard to the numbers of the enemy and their&#xD;
condition, her statement and that of her mo-&#xD;
ther did not agree ; but Allen did not think of&#xD;
studying discrepancies. So entirely was he&#xD;
bound up in the duty upon which he and his&#xD;
have colleagues had been sent, that he did&#xD;
not feel inclined to ask how many he was to&#xD;
meet: his greatest desire was, to know wh e&#xD;
they were.&#xD;
lie got the consul to go back to watt the&#xD;
movementss of De Itegla and the seh ner in&#xD;
Matanzas-promising to follow or send a ves-&#xD;
sel to capture her after he had attended to the&#xD;
ease of the pirates at their head-quarters ; then&#xD;
holding a council with the other officers, he&#xD;
made them acquainted with the rare good&#xD;
news he had received ; and the evening was&#xD;
spent in joyous anticipation of a livelier night&#xD;
to ensue.&#xD;
Perhaps no men enjoy, proportionately with&#xD;
the hardships which they must suffer, life as&#xD;
to our naval otli:crc; none can better appre-&#xD;
ciate a social hour than they. Guarded against&#xD;
.issipation by a stern and severe discipline,&#xD;
they can yet enjoy their friendly glass of wine,&#xD;
r more fraternal glass of "grog," and a fra-&#xD;
grat eigar ; and when in a  knot," can spin&#xD;
thei- " varus" with a gusto that cannot well&#xD;
te2' o rihed or appreeiated, except by one of&#xD;
". :c = or one who has been of them-as&#xD;
,   r.with hiti who pen theme lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
And on this occasion - the honors of the&#xD;
" mess" being dulv performed by Allen, some&#xD;
excellent punch brewed, and other indispensa-&#xD;
blee passed round--the olicers of the little&#xD;
fleet enjoyed themselves until a late hour.&#xD;
They had not un    f ear of another night at-&#xD;
tack  the last had pirlably taken a desire for&#xD;
at turnal comiibat4 out of the main body of&#xD;
the pirate . It was late when Allen's guests&#xD;
left hiim, and he retired at onee; for Monona&#xD;
hid gone back to the shore long before, and&#xD;
lhi. other guests had gone to their state-rooms&#xD;
at an early hour.&#xD;
CH1APTEIt XLI.&#xD;
W Where is Mariana ?" asked Allen, on the&#xD;
ensuing morning, of Maraquita, as the latter&#xD;
came from her state-room, looking as fresh as&#xD;
a magnolia tinged with the morning sunlight.&#xD;
" We wait breakthst now for her.'&#xD;
" I will see," replied the young lady, " if she&#xD;
is dressed."&#xD;
She asent to her state-room and knocked,&#xD;
but received no response. She tried the door;&#xD;
and, it being unfastened, she opened it and&#xD;
looked in. Mariana was not there. Maraquita's&#xD;
exclamation of surprise drew Allen instantly&#xD;
to her side.&#xD;
" Not here !" he exclaimed, in wonder&#xD;
"Where can she be ?"&#xD;
And instantly search was made in nil other&#xD;
parts of the vessel where she could have gone ;&#xD;
for he thought she might have risen early and&#xD;
gone to pronmenade on deck. But she was not&#xD;
to be found ; and on examination, it was dis-&#xD;
covered that the small skiff iii which she&#xD;
came, which had been fastened astern, was also&#xD;
missing.&#xD;
Maraquita now bethought her how~ agitated&#xD;
Mariana had been when they both heard Monona&#xD;
telling Allen about Colee'rinas and his posi-&#xD;
tion, and told 'Allen of it.&#xD;
"I see through the matter now !" said the&#xD;
latter. "Mariana hams been sent here as a spy&#xD;
--she has been to us with falsehood on her&#xD;
lips and treachery in her heart !'" -&#xD;
"I cannot believe it I" responded Maraqui-&#xD;
ta. "She was the only one who was kind to&#xD;
me when I was in his power : her mother,&#xD;
even when she helped me to miy freedom, was&#xD;
stern and harsh. There is some mystery in&#xD;
this ; but I cannot believe that Mariana came&#xD;
as a spy l"&#xD;
" We will see. I. shall learn, before mid-&#xD;
night, if my conjectures are right ; for if she&#xD;
has been here ns a spy, and discovered her&#xD;
mother's treachery to the band, Colcefrinas&#xD;
will know it, and be on his guard."&#xD;
"Even if it were so, she would not betray&#xD;
her itother to his terrible anger !"&#xD;
"It would not seem natural that she should&#xD;
-but crime, or an association with criminals,&#xD;
hardens every nature. There is no imagining&#xD;
what she would or would not do. But this&#xD;

62                                OUR ME&#xD;
must not spoil our appetites : to breakfast,&#xD;
fair lady mine-to breakfast!"&#xD;
Trhiey hal bit just taken seats at the table,&#xD;
when a message from the officer of the deck&#xD;
announced a boat coming into the bay, with&#xD;
an English flag flying over hier stern-sheets.&#xD;
The face of Allen Bushed with pleasure yi&#xD;
he received the message.&#xD;
"If any of the EniglhPli fleet are outside,"&#xD;
said he, "~they will gladly cu-operate with us,&#xD;
and our force will be so strengthened that no&#xD;
position or defeice of the pirates will avail&#xD;
them. If there is an oticer in the English&#xD;
boat, let him be invited to breakfast with me,"&#xD;
he added, to the messenger.&#xD;
" There are two, sir," said the latter: "I saw&#xD;
them before I caine below."&#xD;
"Very well. Steward, place two' more&#xD;
plates here, and let the cook do his duty.&#xD;
l'hese Englishmen live by eating! They're&#xD;
in a good humor only when their bread-baskets&#xD;
are fill."&#xD;
Maraquita smiled at this idea, for it seemed&#xD;
singular thnt one's good-nature should depend&#xD;
on his feeding.&#xD;
But she had not time to make any remarks,&#xD;
if any suggested themselves to her, for two of-&#xD;
ficers were ushered into the cabin. Both wore&#xD;
the crown-and-anchor button of the royal&#xD;
navy ; but one was dressed in a black frock&#xD;
coat, and wore the spotless cravat of white,&#xD;
which told tint he was a chaplain in the serv-&#xD;
ice. The first-a fine-looking man, of not&#xD;
more than thiirty--introduced himself as Lord&#xD;
Seymour, ca ptain of the frigate Medusa, and&#xD;
introduced the other as Mr. Mordnunt, the chap-&#xD;
lain of his ship.&#xD;
Both gentlemen accepted the invitation to&#xD;
breakfast without hesitation: a morning's row&#xD;
from the frigate, which lay in the roads, five&#xD;
or six miles off, had given them an appetite.&#xD;
And Allen's appetite seemed to increase-for&#xD;
a new and happy thought had entered his&#xD;
mind the moment that he saw the clerical rig&#xD;
of the chaplain. What it was, none but a di-&#xD;
abolical old bachelor, or a wretched ancient&#xD;
maiden, will have or take occasion to inquire.&#xD;
And as his eyes met those of Maraquita, and&#xD;
glanced thence toward the chaplain, a blush&#xD;
on her lovely cheek told that she read the first&#xD;
wish of his'heart-a blush of joy; for thought&#xD;
she was modest and pure as a child, yet she&#xD;
was too artless to conceal her warm heart's feel-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
While they were at breakfast,Allen, without&#xD;
hesitation, revealed his knowledge of the pi-&#xD;
rates and their position, and his intention of&#xD;
attacking them ; and asked the co-operation&#xD;
of Lord Seymour and as many of his crew as&#xD;
he could spire. The latter assented readily :&#xD;
"'Twill be a jolly bit of fun, no doubt,"&#xD;
said lie. "Parson, you'd as readily take a&#xD;
hand in it as you would a game of wlhist,&#xD;
wouldn't you ?" he added, addressing the chap-&#xD;
lain.&#xD;
&#xD;
ss, oR,&#xD;
"More readily !" said Mr. Mordaunt. "Are&#xD;
not those bloodthirsty creatures the enemies&#xD;
alike of Cod and man. It is our solemn duty&#xD;
to destroy them!"&#xD;
" I was not aware before that the chaplains&#xD;
of your navy ever encountered active service,"&#xD;
said Allen, vith a smile at the earnest manner&#xD;
of the chaph in's reply.&#xD;
" If we tig itwith the men for a victory that&#xD;
we have prayed for," answered the chaplain,&#xD;
"they will be sure to believe in our sincer-&#xD;
ity.'&#xD;
"That is so!" replied Seymour, with a&#xD;
smile. ' "You see, lieutenant, we have a model&#xD;
chaplain, who believes in works as well as&#xD;
words !"&#xD;
"So I perceive, sir. IIe must be a valuable&#xD;
auxiliary on board your vessel."&#xD;
"HUe is, indeed. Why, he is quite a sailor,&#xD;
withal. He can take an observation as well as&#xD;
the master: work ship ; and to-night, if we&#xD;
overhaul those bloody buccaneers, you will&#xD;
s e how well he can handle a sword."&#xD;
"Does lie understand knotting ndil splic-&#xD;
ing ?" asked Allen. And he glanced at Mar.&#xD;
aquita.&#xD;
Though she did. not understand nautical&#xD;
terms, the lady seemed to comprehend the&#xD;
meaning of that question, for the red blood&#xD;
again flushed her cheek and mantled her brow.&#xD;
Seymour saw the look and blush, and in a&#xD;
moment comprehended the drift of the quer-&#xD;
ist.&#xD;
"Yes, very well," he answered. "iIe has&#xD;
hid several occasions to practice since  lie has&#xD;
been on this station, andi I assure you is com-&#xD;
pletely au fait at the business."&#xD;
"If lie intends to join our expedition to-&#xD;
night, I may ask a trial of his skill before we&#xD;
go, for fear that lie may be incapacitated for&#xD;
acting before we return," said Allen. "To be&#xD;
brief md to the point, lMr. Mordaunt," he&#xD;
continued, " this lady and myself are engaged&#xD;
to be married ; and as there is no legal imped-&#xD;
iment to our union, the emeiony might be&#xD;
performed here, which should have been per-&#xD;
formed in the first port I reached."&#xD;
"Certainly ; and it will afford me sincere&#xD;
pleasure to act upon the happy occasion, and&#xD;
to tie a knot which no mortal can justly untie,"&#xD;
said the chaplain.&#xD;
Maraquita having excused herself and re-&#xD;
tired to her room, Allen gave his visitors a&#xD;
brief account of her recent romantic ativen.&#xD;
tures, withholding for her sake the knowledge&#xD;
that lie had of her father's complicity with&#xD;
the pirates. In truth, he hind withheld it from&#xD;
her so far as lie could, though she could not&#xD;
but know something of it. lIe knew that she&#xD;
was not to blame for any evil which her father&#xD;
might have dlone, or might do ; and lie was not&#xD;
one of that msite-souled, narrow-minded class&#xD;
which think that tue ha. act of one person at&#xD;
taints the blood of every one connected with&#xD;
him by blood.&#xD;

"My lord, you are too~generods."&#xD;
"Not a bit of it, my dear fellow. I am&#xD;

Maraquita, with gratitude in her throbbing&#xD;
heart, overheard this conversation ; and though&#xD;
there was agony in the thought that he might&#xD;
fail, she could not but love icr noble husband&#xD;
all the better because no motive or ecue&#xD;
would draw him aside from the path of duty.&#xD;
Sh° applauded his resolution in silence, while&#xD;
she prayed that every peril might h averted&#xD;

first to betray him, to shout at his murder,&#xD;
and to aid in the cowardly butchery. But&#xD;
this is not a part of my sto'-y-only a drop of&#xD;
the bitterness that experience among such&#xD;
bounds lis squeezed oit of my nature.&#xD;
Back to my pen-path. Byt he time that&#xD;
night fell, every'available boat from the three&#xD;
American vessels and from the British frigate,&#xD;
was manned with armed crews. The flags of&#xD;
the two nations floated side by side in the&#xD;
same friendly breeze, for the only contest now&#xD;
was to be which would be foremost in punish-&#xD;
ing the red-iatnded enemiits of all tile world.&#xD;
The chaplain, who had laid aside his black&#xD;

pride. For the shadow of gloom which, in&#xD;
spite of his efforts, had fallen on his heart&#xD;
more than once during the afternoon, had&#xD;
renehed her heart, and she now clung to him&#xD;
with a foreboding that they would meet no&#xD;
more in life. He felt-alas! sadly felt-that&#xD;
foreboding, but he hushed it down And would&#xD;
not let it reach her ears.&#xD;
"heaven bless you, dearest-I must go, for&#xD;
my men await my coming. Keelp up a good&#xD;
heart, I will return victorious in a few hours&#xD;
and my duty done, will give my time to love&#xD;

who was by his sde : " It is time that we saw&#xD;
or heard something from Mariant I1do not&#xD;

Scarcely had these words passed his lips&#xD;
when a hurried step was heard, alid the sub&#xD;
ject of his thoughts and words made her ap-&#xD;
pearanee. 11cr face was paleu and anxios--&#xD;
her manner nervous, and full of agitation.&#xD;
r    "You have news ?" cried Coleefrinas, hur-&#xD;

"t have. It is not good. The rendezvous&#xD;

with a strong effort completely mastering his&#xD;

le said, in the mil st1)  gentle tone  " You need&#xD;

I kniw not. It'was nearly (lawn when I&#xD;
escaped from thevessel, and I had to row far&#xD;
to windward, ailoiig the islands, to escape the&#xD;
sight of their guard-boats, which are rowing&#xD;
along the coast. I heard the guns fired asif&#xD;
for a salute, and supposed that more vessel&#xD;

h " Likely. J)o vou think they know of the&#xD;

"IS is well. let ire tinow, my good child, and&#xD;

Mariana's tace flushed'with joy. ie spoke&#xD;
to her so kindly. She again kissed his hand,&#xD;
and then retired as he bade 1her'.&#xD;
But the moment that she was gone, the&#xD;
bland look upon the face of Colcefrinasphang-&#xD;
and even Solano, who knew him so well,&#xD;
was almost terrified at the terrible change&#xD;
which his anger made in his face.&#xD;
The tigress was right I" lie hissed. " She&#xD;
Is mut to he despised! But she is to be pun-&#xD;
ished! The traitiess shall dearly rue the heur&#xD;
when first the thought of treachery to us en-&#xD;
tered her heart !"&#xD;
"To whom do you allude ?" asked Solano,&#xD;
"To Monona. She it is who has betrayed&#xD;
us! Siheit was who -rinformed the cursed&#xD;
Yankees of our intended surprise, and who&#xD;
caused the loss of half our best men, and gain-&#xD;
ed for me these crippling wounds. I have&#xD;
been blind not to guard against her, knowing&#xD;
that a jealous woman will not stop at any-&#xD;
thing. But she has had help, She could not&#xD;
go alone, for she has not Mariana's skill with&#xD;
the oar. We must quietly find out whom she&#xD;
has in her confidence, who has rowed her&#xD;
'about in the many little pleasure-exeursions&#xD;
&#xD;
which she has recently undertaken. To yo,&#xD;
Solano, I intrust this delicate work while I&#xD;
confront her ; and then we must make haste to&#xD;
prepare to receive our friends to-night. If&#xD;
they do obtain a foothold here, we have yet a&#xD;
place of retreat which they cannot force-if&#xD;
they do, it will be the worse for them, for if&#xD;
the worst cones to the worst, mlly own hand&#xD;
shall send all to hell together. 'I know that&#xD;
you never will desert me !"&#xD;
"Never-never !" said Solano, as he grasped&#xD;
the hand of the desperate chief.&#xD;
" Then haste to do my bidding. But let no&#xD;
agitation of yours announce our discoveries.&#xD;
When you have found those mn out, secure&#xD;
them where they cannot bh seen or spoken to&#xD;
except by their guard, and bid the latter nei-&#xD;

causing any excitement, if you can. If she&#xD;
comes, send two of the trustiest men to await&#xD;

'Th'lie officer bowed, and'Colcefrinas, who, by&#xD;
a great effort, had again become calm, was left&#xD;
for the moment alone.&#xD;
.CHIAPTER XLV.&#xD;
"You wanted me-so said your messenger I&#xD;
I am here."&#xD;
Monona, when she entered the room and ut-&#xD;
tered these words to Coleefriuas, looked as&#xD;
quiet and innocent as if never a storm had&#xD;
raged in her heart, or a bitter thought emanat-&#xD;
ed from her mind.&#xD;
The pirate chief looked at her intently for a&#xD;
minute or two, without speaking.&#xD;
" Sit down," said he, at last. " Your re-&#xD;
cent exertions must have fatigued you !"&#xD;
"Not at all. One scarcely feels fatigued&#xD;
when they are in pursuit of pleasure"&#xD;
"Then you have been in the pursuit of plea-&#xD;
sure ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And found it !"&#xD;
"Not yet-but soon expect to do so 1"&#xD;
"When-at midnight, to-night, when yoa&#xD;
light the beacon on the outer point ?"&#xD;
For a moment, the woman's forced compos-&#xD;
ure gave way, and the color left her check, and&#xD;
she trembled ; for she felt that lie had gained&#xD;
some knowledge of her secret. But how, she&#xD;
could not divine; for her boat's crew were&#xD;
sworn by terrible oaths to be true to her, and&#xD;
her only, and they did not know of the ar-&#xD;
rangement to light the beacon. That had&#xD;
been made with Allen alone. But her sterner&#xD;
nature in a moment gave her strength to meet&#xD;
his glance, and she replied:&#xD;
"You speak in words which I do not under-&#xD;
stand!"&#xD;
"'You need not add falsehood to the crime&#xD;
of treachery, madam. I know all of your ac-&#xD;
tions and intentions, and when the Americana&#xD;

" Very well, sir, 1 give you joy i  your&#xD;

vise you to make due provision to assist you&#xD;
in running away again !&#xD;
You are thoughtful, madam. And for&#xD;

And as he said this, he made a motion to&#xD;
the men who had been sent by Sjlano, and&#xD;
they at once advanced to seize her.&#xD;
Back-back-lay a hand upon me and you&#xD;
die !" she cried ; and in an intant she changed&#xD;
from the clove into the tigress. Her dark eyes&#xD;
fairly blazed, as she drew a pistol, from her ho-&#xD;
son, and with her back to the wall, confronted&#xD;
the enn, For an instant they hesitated.&#xD;
"Coyvards ! She is but a woman ." said the&#xD;
chief.&#xD;
One of the men sprung forward to seize her.&#xD;
The action was his last, for a ball crashed&#xD;
through his brain crc le had taken two steps&#xD;
forward. The other, with an oath, sprung to&#xD;
seize her before she could draw another wea-&#xD;
pon, but he was too slow. She drew another&#xD;
pistol before he could reach her-fired-and&#xD;
he sunk with a low groan to the floor.&#xD;
"I would serve you as l have thm," she&#xD;
said, bitterly, to Colcefrinas, "if I did not re-&#xD;
serve to myself the hope to see you hanged."&#xD;
"Murderess-you shall die for this I" cried&#xD;
the excited chief. "Seize the she-devil&#xD;
The last order was given to Solano, who,&#xD;
with a guard of men, had hurried in, attracted&#xD;
by the firing. And as they took her unawares,&#xD;
the desperate woman was instantly secured.&#xD;
"Remove her to tla e strong-roomd below-&#xD;
she has slain your comrades, men, and betray-&#xD;
ed us all! I will find a fitting punishment for&#xD;
her," said the chief.&#xD;
Scarcely had they left the room in obedi-&#xD;
ence to the order, with their prisoner ,when&#xD;
Mariana, who had been awakened from slum-&#xD;
ber by the sound of the shots, hurried in.&#xD;
a What is the matter, my master ?" she ask-&#xD;
ed. "Are you in peril? "&#xD;
"It is past, good Mariana, it is past," h&#xD;
said, with a gentle smile. "Do not be dis-&#xD;
turbed, but rest now; for in a little time I shall&#xD;
call my officers to council, and then I shaht&#xD;
need you."&#xD;
The girl glanced at the bodies upon the&#xD;
floor, and knew that the chief had been in peril&#xD;
but she questioned no further. He was safe,&#xD;
and the danger was past.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLV&#xD;
It was wi night; and at the head of the dens&#xD;
column of boats containing the united forced&#xD;
of English and Americans. Allen cautiousl3&#xD;
approached that part of the coast where Mono&#xD;
ualudpromised to light a beacon which would&#xD;
&#xD;
lead them to the masked entrance to the bay&#xD;
of rendezvous. Another boat close by the&#xD;
side of hiis own, so near that low-voiced words&#xD;
could be heard from one to the other, contain-&#xD;
ed Lord Semour and his chaplain.&#xD;
'ed  eight was not entirely obscure -the&#xD;
moon was up, but drifting clouds moving over&#xD;
the sky caused its light to fall only in patches&#xD;
lure and there upon the earth.&#xD;
"Is it not time that the beacon the woman&#xD;
promised wis alight?" asked Seymour of Al.&#xD;
i-n. "My watch says twelve.,,&#xD;
Mine also," replied Allen  "And we are&#xD;
iear the shore. Alh, there the light lashlme.&#xD;
Sne is true to her word."&#xD;
A bright blaze was seen suddenly to spring&#xD;

1bmg a woman's dress, Allen exclaimed :-&#xD;
"It is thi woman and her boats crew. We&#xD;
are all right, and can go on safely'&#xD;
Giving the order to his mea to row on, Al-&#xD;
len steered directly to the point, and the other&#xD;
boats followed. When within a few fathoms&#xD;
of this shore, lie gave orem-un to thme other boats&#xD;
to hi-s upon their oars, while he pulled to the&#xD;
shore to confer with the woman, and learn&#xD;

silent and motionless--whichr, with ami exehmuma-&#xD;

" o        rhat is thems atter ?" asked Seymour,&#xD;
hurrying up.&#xD;
hGod of nercy I Look there-we ourselves&#xD;
are in peril, for the pirates are on their guardI"&#xD;
exclaimed Allen.&#xD;
Beth Seymour and his chaplain also paused&#xD;
in horror for a moment, for now they saw why&#xD;
tIe group had been silent and motionless.&#xD;
Emch person-Monona and all of her boat's&#xD;
crew--was dead, and fastened in an erect po-&#xD;
sit )1 tmo stakes. Upon the breast of Monona&#xD;
wasfutened a placard, with these words writ-&#xD;

which coitaied the body of poor Allen snme&#xD;
distance, to endeavor to break the news of hbe'&#xD;
gallant husband's untimely fall, as gentle as&#xD;
possible, to pioor Maraquita.&#xD;
To their utter surprise, they found that lady&#xD;
aated im the eabin, calm and quiet, but with&#xD;
the pallor of death on her cheek, which was&#xD;
made more visible by the dress which she wore.&#xD;
It was black. She had already donned the.&#xD;
robes of mourning.&#xD;
She smiled gently, but oh, how sadly ! iis&#xD;
they cautme im, and in a low tone said, as she&#xD;
motioned their to seats&#xD;
. You are hind. .-You come to speak words&#xD;
of consolation t o the widow ! You need not&#xD;

aid, after a pause. And then she shivered as&#xD;
with cold, and rose and stood for a moment as if&#xD;
listening.  -1I hear the glad cathedral bells ?"&#xD;
she murmured. " Come love-come !" and&#xD;
she reached out her hand as if to lead him with&#xD;
her.  The next instant, though, she reeled&#xD;
and fell, so stiff and cold that all thought her&#xD;
dead. But Doctor O'Shaughnessy, who had&#xD;
been wee ping like a child, sprung to her aid,&#xD;
and found that she was only in a swoon-her&#xD;
overstrained spirit had not strength to sustain&#xD;
her body.&#xD;
Restoratives were used, and she was borne&#xD;
to her couch, while it was decided by the oil-&#xD;
ceas now in conuuand to take the vessel at&#xD;
once to Matanzas, where, if the lady desired,&#xD;
she could be restored to her father. Amid the&#xD;
intention of Allen to go there in- sni:c the&#xD;
"i Plot " was nott forgotten.&#xD;
'W hen thef;Almai1u          ~ , s  e-mme&#xD;
by the Mids.t 'tehiI the hurler    N&#xD;
is, they found iha ihEy iWerei a few hours tlO&#xD;
late to capture the supposed pirate. S lwhad&#xD;
either finished her repairs sooner tlmati was ins-&#xD;
ticipated, or gone to sea with sonie of them&#xD;
left undone ; for, much to the surprise and&#xD;
chagrin of the cnsulsi-Iho supposed he was&#xD;
keeping a close wateh upon her--she slipped&#xD;
off and went to sea, or somewhere out of sight,&#xD;
during the night previous to the arrival of the&#xD;
pirate-hunting fleet.&#xD;
The people of Maftanzas seemed to be really&#xD;
glad to hear of the destruction of the pirates.&#xD;
Perhaps they were.    And the Marquis de&#xD;
Regh, it need not be doubted, was glad ; for&#xD;
Coleefrinas had beome to him more than a&#xD;
te 'ror: and the report of the Americans was,&#xD;
like their belief, that Colcefrinas was slain-&#xD;
had perished in the explosion.&#xD;
Nor did the marquis mourn for the death of&#xD;
Allen, because he bore no good-will to the.&#xD;
Americans as a natition ; but he did grieve sin-&#xD;
cerely at the condition in which his daughter&#xD;
had come back to himm: for, as we have said&#xD;
more thami once in this story, he loved her with&#xD;
all the love that was in his nature. She had&#xD;
beco-me-or, in fact, had been-from the hour&#xD;
when her husband's bosdy was brought to her,&#xD;
 harmlessly, hopelessly, pitifuly insane.&#xD;
It swas amnost heut-reirding to hear her talk.&#xD;
Faneying at one time that lie was by her side,&#xD;
she woui address him in the fondest and most&#xD;
endearing terms. 'Then again, seeming to think&#xD;
him temporarily absent, she would plead in&#xD;
tearful agony for him to come back to her.&#xD;
Still again, serming to see him in the red me-&#xD;
lee of a terrible fight, she would throw up her&#xD;
armis, and shriek to heaven to'save him ; and&#xD;
in that mood she would fall away into eon-&#xD;
vls ins, which barely left her alive&#xD;

TIlE PIRATE-IIUNTERS OF TIlE GULF.&#xD;
&#xD;
She hid to be watched constantly, lest she&#xD;
should destroy herself. And most hard of all,&#xD;
to her father, she did not recognize him. Nor'&#xD;
did she seem  to remember any of her old&#xD;
friends, when they came to see her. Two per--&#xD;
sons only could get rational replies from her&#xD;
- these two were the only ones whom she&#xD;
would call by name : one was Lord Seymour,&#xD;
who had become very deeply interested in&#xD;
her ; the other was his chaplain, Mr. Mordaunt.&#xD;
Seeming to recognize them as her husband s&#xD;
last friends on earth, she appeared to be fond&#xD;
of their society, and was ever child-like cr1d&#xD;
gentle when they were with her. But dilly&#xD;
would not permit of their lengthened stay in&#xD;
port ; for soon, though terrible their ciastis-&#xD;
nienit had been of the pirates, reports of new&#xD;
outrages along the Coast cane to their ears;&#xD;
and they found that the pirates, instead of ho-&#xD;
ing utterly extermiiated, were yet numerous,&#xD;
and qven powerful on the coast. 'Thierefore,&#xD;
both the English and American men-of-war&#xD;
were soon off igrin to renew their exertions to&#xD;
destroy the destroyers.&#xD;

have aecumiulated upon his head.&#xD;

reached out his hand, as if he would touch&#xD;

The wretheud marquis stood for a moment&#xD;
as if spell-bound, and then, with a wild cry of&#xD;
agony, stepped but a single step forward, and&#xD;
fell senseless to the floor.&#xD;
When loe reeovered his senses, his startled&#xD;
servants were aronul him, but his daughter&#xD;
was not there. ie asked where she was, but&#xD;
no one knew.   Ard when he spoke of Colce'-&#xD;

"What is that ?" asked Maraquita. And&#xD;
she pointed to the head of a serpent, rudely&#xD;
carved, appearing to be a singular ornament&#xD;
to the back of the kind of dais, or throne on&#xD;
which he sat.&#xD;
" My guard, pretty one-my guard I 'Is it&#xD;
not, my men ?"&#xD;
Some of them   turned pale, and others&#xD;
laughed, as he asked the question. They&#xD;
knew well what it was, and that a match ap-&#xD;
plied to the mouth of that serpent would fire&#xD;
a train which would blow them all into atoms.&#xD;
"Yes, yes-I have eard of it before," she&#xD;
said. " With it you hold, indeed, a kingly&#xD;
lpowver in your hands-the power of eatli."&#xD;
