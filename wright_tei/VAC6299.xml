            <p>WE have no dislike to religious fictions; but where authentic facts are already too
               abundant for our limited space, we see no reason to lay aside realities in which
               divine grace has been the chief agent, and some human heart the real scene of the
               action, for the sake of suppositions or inventions of the mind, were they ever so
               pious and interesting.</p>
            <p>When the following pages were presented to us by their well-known gifted authoress,
               we felt delighted with their beautiful diction and their deeply interesting
               incidents; still we would not have presented the rich sketch, had it been merely a
               fine tale. We therefore felt no ordinary gratification, when we received, a few days
               since, the reply which we subjoin, inclosing four pages of a closely-written letter
               from our venerable friend, Bishop de Charbonnel, containing, in substance, the whole
               history of Coaina. But let the illustrious authoress herself introduce, not the
               story, but the history of her admirable heroine:</p>

                        <p>After the time and labor I have expended on Coaina, I have it fully in my
                           power to authenticate its truthfulness, under our<pb n="iv-v"
                              xml:id="VAC6299-00000003"/> dear Monseigneur de Charbonnel's own hand.
                           Some twenty-five or six years ago, this saintly man, then a missionary
                           priest in Canada, came to the Seminary of St. Sulpice, in Baltimore, for
                           the purpose of learning the English language through a regular
                           grammatical course of study. He was a nobleman of rank, and had long
                           before relinquished his title and estates to a younger brother, in
                           France, to become a missionary priest.</p>
                        <p>I learned this from my venerated old confessor, Father Deluol, who was
                           Superior of St. Sulpice, and who introduced Father Charbonnel to us.</p>
                        <p>Father Charbonnel was in the habit of coming frequently to our house to
                           converse in English with us, and we considered it a great privilege to
                           entertain him at all times. One evening he brought the little manuscript
                           which I inclose—his <emph>first English composition</emph>—which he read
                           to us with all the pleasure and simplicity of a child, and to which we
                           listened with the deepest interest.</p>
                        <p>Once launched on the subject of Coaina he gave us many interesting
                           particulars of her history, not recorded in his little narrative. I was
                           greatly interested, and promised him that I would at some future day
                           elaborate and make it into a story. I have kept it religiously, partly on
                           account of my promise, partly for the touching facts it relates, and
                           partly as a relic of a saintly friend. Although Father Charbonnel was
                           reticent on that point, I am <emph>very sure</emph> that he was the
                           priest of the mission at the time these events occurred. He would not own
                           to it, but allowed us to infer it. A year or so after he left Baltimore
                           he was made Bishop of Toronto. In the course of a few years he resigned
                           the mitre for the cowl.</p>
                        <p>In talking of Coaina he expatiated on Coaina's devotion to the Blessed
                           Virgin. Probably I have not been happy in bringing out this fact
                           conspicuously, but no one can read the narrative attentively without
                           feeling it. The names of the characters—except Coaina's—are fictitious,
                           and so are some of the trivial incidents and embellishments.</p>
                        <p>The situation of the mission, the village, the calvary, the description
                           of the people, the account of the "Taho," are all to be found in the
                           "History of the Indian Missions in North America," which has been one of
                           my favorite books for years past.</p>
                        <p>In writing Coaina, I had one special object in view, besides illustrating
                           the beauty and triumph of religion, and that is to reprove the sins of
                           uncharitableness, slander, and rash judgment, the three sins which
                           crucified Christ. These are the sins of our age. I sometimes wonder, such
                           is the prevalence of these evils among Christians, if true charity has
                           become an obsolete virtue.</p>
                        <p>Would to God our clergy, and the Catholic press, would make a crusade
                           against the specious, special, universal and—shall I say it—infernal sin
                           of slander, in all its forms. I don't know that I ever found any thing
                           more applicable to this point, than the history of Coaina.</p>

               <p>NOT far from Montreal lies a beautiful lake, which is formed by the dancing waters
                  of the Ottawa, and surrounded by picturesque hills, which slope in gentle
                  undulations down to its sedgy margin. It is called Canaradago, or the "Lake of the
                  Two Mountains. "One of the hills is crowned by a Calvary, which is approached by a
                  rugged, circuitous path, along the sides of which stand, at regular intervals,
                  small rustic chapels, which are much visited by pious pilgrims, and where, during
                  Lent, the congregations of the Mission devoutly perform the "Stations of the
                  Cross," and sing, as they march in solemn procession towards the cross-crowned
                  summit, the sorrows of Mary, the sonorous and mournful chaunt blending, in
                  harmonious accord,<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6299-00000005"/> with the penitential
                  season, and the commemorative suggestions of the spot.</p>
               <p>Straggling along the shores of the lake and up the slopes, partly hidden by the
                  hills and partly sheltered by the dark primeval forest, which recedes gradually
                  northward, and where the pines and hemlocks ever moan together the sad hymn of the
                  centuries, nestle two Indian villages of a Catholic mission, which diverge to the
                  right and left. The one on the right belongs to a remnant of the once powerful
                  Algonquins; that on the left to a remnant of the Iroquois, who were, in former
                  times, one of the great aboriginal nations of the north; but although such near
                  neighbors, these two people are as distinct in manners and language as they were
                  in the days of Carter and Champlain. These Catholic Indians are the descendants of
                  the fierce savages who tortured the blessed Father Jogues, and martyred, with
                  cruel and prolonged torments the noble and saintly Brebeuf. They live in lodges
                  built of logs and covered with bark, and, during the spring and summer, cultivate
                  their fields and garden patches, where they raise corn, squashes, potatoes, beans,
                  melons and other useful vegetables and fruits; the women, sharing the lighter
                  labors of the men, fish, dress skins and bark, dye the quills of the porcupine,
                  spin and weave a coarse cloth, embroider the garments, leggings and moccasins,
                  which they so ingeniously fashion, with beads, tinsel, porcupine quills and
                  fringes; train their children in strict obedience to the rules of the mission, and
                  in the autumn migrate, with their husbands and families, to the hunting grounds of
                  the far northwest.</p>
               <p>Devoutly christian as many of these Indians are, and deeming it their greatest
                  earthly privilege to have a resident missionary priest among them to baptize and
                  instruct their children and themselves in the way of salvation, to guide them
                  aright while living and console them when dying, they adhere with tenacity to many
                  of their traditionary habits and customs. On state occasions, they smoke the
                  calumet as a sort of a ratification ceremony, wear proudly the trophies of the
                  chase, cling to their nomadic habits, take a simple pleasure in gew-gaws,
                  feathers, embroidered garments, and, at certain times, do not refrain from
                  painting their faces with vermillion and other rich colors, and are ever ready to
                  engage, with great zest, in their primitive and stirring games. Religion has
                  stripped these children of the forest of none of their simple enjoyments or
                  innocent customs. It has done more<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6299-00000006"/> grandly,
                  more divinely; it has transformed them from worshippers of idols to worshippers
                  and adorers of the one true God—from a belief in a false and weird cosmogony, and
                  crude mythological fables and traditions, to a firm belief and enduring faith in
                  the wonderful story of the creation, of the birth of man, of the atonement of
                  Jesus Christ and the divine establishment of His Church upon earth; made them
                  children of that fold which acknowledges ONE LORD, ONE FAITH, ONE BAPTISM, and
                  believes in the commandments of Almighty God, and the precepts of His Church.
                  Thus, by and easy transition, it became a strange but devout pleasure to these
                  primitive people, instead of offering sacrifice and libations to the great <hi

                  in any enterprise of hardship and peril, to invoke the protection of the Blessed
                  Virgin, and ask the assistance of the prayers of the saints; to commend
                  themselves, during their journey through trackless forests, and over rapid rivers,
                  to the guardian care of the angels of God, instead of the elfish <hi rend="i"

                  souls, a "place of refreshment, light and peace," instead of performing the
                  heathenish rites of old, which were practiced at the feast of the dead.</p>
               <p>It was amongst this people, who are the fruits of the blossoming of the Canadian
                  wilderness, whose rocky solitudes were moistened by the vivifying dews of the
                  precious blood of Christ's martyrs, that the events which we are about to relate
                  happened somewhere near the year 1838, and if our introduction has been somewhat
                  prosy, it was necessary to a better understanding of the narrative, that it should
                  be written; therefore, patient reader, if you will accompany me to the chapel of
                  the Algonquin village, which stands on yonder knoll, under the broad shadow of the
                  hemlock and sycamore trees which surround it, I will, without further preface,
                  introduce you to Coaina, the "Rose of the Algonquins," and other personages of our
                  narrative.</p>
               <p>Something is in progress in and around the rustic chapel, into which the slanting
                  rays of an August sun fall in trembling showers of gold through the quivering
                  leaves, which indicates an approaching festival. Young Indian lads, with
                  blossom-laden boughs from the forest, with trailing vines bedight with flowers of
                  tropical hues, with baskets of<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6299-00000007"/> mosses, with
                  branches of wild roses, with great clusters of golden-rod, asters and the wood
                  anemone, with wicker cages containing birds, with clusters of wild grapes, still
                  clinging in purple richness to the graceful vines, and garlands of ground myrtle,
                  glowing with thousands of coral berries, were grouped here and there around the
                  chapel doors, talking in subdued but cheerful voices, their low converse
                  interrupted now and then by a burst of innocent laughter, which sounded in sweet
                  accord with the rustling of leaves overhead, the wild notes of the caged birds,
                  the drowsy hum of bees, and the distant murmurs of the dancing waters of the lake.
                  The lads peeped now and then into the chapel; they were waiting for some one who
                  was within to come out and receive the floral treasures and offerings they had
                  brought. Meanwhile they took pleasure in observing the beautiful and sacred
                  objects and adornments of the altar, and the shrine of Our Blessed Lady of the
                  forest.</p>
               <p>"Look, Joseph," said a little fellow, standing beside a basket which was covered
                  with burdock leaves, "Coaina has unrolled the banner, and is hanging it upon the
                  wall behind the altar. Don't it shine? I've seen the sky look so often when the
                  sun goes down."</p>
               <p>"Ugh! that's a grand banner, 'Tony. That's the banner that the ladies of Montreal
                  gave to the mission a long time ago. They worked it with their fingers, and it's
                  full of real gold, pearls and rubies, and was blessed, at the cathedral, by the
                  great chief of the Church, who wears a pointed crown," replied Joseph.</p>
               <p>"What's all that upon it, and what does it mean?" asked little 'Tony; "Do you know
                  Joseph?"</p>
               <p>"Father Etienne took me into the chapel once, and unrolled the banner and
                  explained it all to me, because I did not miss a single word in my whole
                  catechism," replied Joseph, proudly. "I will tell you, but I don't know whether
                  you'll understand it if I do."</p>
               <p>"I'll try," said little 'Tony, humbly.</p>
               <p>"Well, you see the eagle feathers, the bear and the arrows and things. That's the
                     <hi rend="i"/>totem, (coat of arms,) of the three christian tribes. Under that,
                  all in gold—red and yellow gold—with rubies done in so cunningly, are the three
                  council fires, and over all, linked with the rest, you see, by devices of things
                  most prized by our people, is what Father Etienne called the <hi rend="i"
                  />Monogram of Jesus Christ." Here both boys bowed their heads and made the sign of
                  the Cross. "You see, 'Tony, that is all<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6299-00000008"/>
                  done with gold, and silver, and pearls; but what the word means I don't exactly
                  know, and was ashamed to ask, but I thought maybe it was <emph>His</emph> Holy
                  Name, in characters which I did not understand."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Joseph. Isn't it a great honor to have our totem on the banner with
                  Christ's?" said little 'Tony, naively. "But look, Joseph, at that bright star upon
                  our Blessed Lady's head!"</p>
               <p>"Kaw! it is the sunshine!" said a lad standing by. Not irreverently, however, was
                  this said. The boy was only constitutionally matter-of-fact, and could not make a
                  star out of sunshine.</p>
               <p>"Sunshine is the light of the Great Spirit, and it <emph>does</emph> look like a
                  star. Anyhow, don't you wish it would stay there, for that's the way I think SHE
                  looks in the land of the Great Spirit," said little 'Tony earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Well, yes, I'd like that sunshine to stay there if it could, but it
                     <emph>can't.</emph> I'd let it stay if I could, but <emph>I</emph> can't
                  either, so it's no use to be wishing. I'd crown her with stars if I could reach
                  high enough, to place them, but as I'm not high enough, we"ll have to crown our
                  'white Mother,' (a name by which the Indians of the mission called
                     <emph>her,</emph>) with flowers," said the matter-of-fact lad, moving off.</p>
               <p>"See here, Joseph," whispered 'Tony, lifting up the burdock leaves that covered
                  his basket, "will these do for the crown? I found them, under piles of leaves,
                  down in the glen, near the dancing waters. "Do you think Coaina will make a
                  garland of them for Our Blessed Lady's head?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, 'Tony, how beautiful! where did you find these white violets? I think they
                  must have bloomed on purpose to crown our Mother on the Feast of the Assumption!"
                  exclaimed, in clear, pleasant tones, the voice of a beautiful Indian maiden, who
                  had just left off hanging festoons of flowers around the rustic railing which
                  enclosed the altar, to come in search of fresh mosses for the shrine, and flowers
                  to crown the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Coaina! I think so, too," said little 'Tony, as he lifted his sparkling
                  eyes to her face. "I found them down by the dancing waters, in the glen, under a
                  great pile of leaves. My heart sings like a bird because you love them,
                  Coaina."</p>
               <p>"Yes, 'Tony, these are lovely!" said the maiden, lifting the rich, variegated
                  mosses upon which the violets rested. "So like <emph>her,</emph>" she murmured,
                  "so fair, yet so lovely; so pure, yet so humble; so holy and modest, yet
                  concealing all, and covering her divine honors with the poor garb of poverty
                     and<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6299-00000009"/> seclusion. Yes, "Tony," said
                  Coaina aloud, "these look as if each one had dropped from a star—don't you
                  remember the old legend I told you the other day?—and we will crown Our Blessed
                  Lady with them."</p>
               <p>As this is not a fiction which we are relating, having learned the facts we
                  relate, some years ago, from Monsignor De C——, I will describe Coaina, who was not
                  only known by her baptismal name, Coaina (Catharine), but was so beautiful, and so
                  beloved for her great virtues and the sweetness of her disposition, that her
                  people of the mission gave her the soubriquet of <hi rend="i"/>To-hic—The Rose. As
                  Coaina stood, holding the moss and violets in her hands—the sunlight flickering
                  down through the trembling foliage, sprinkling her from head to foot with
                  glittering spots of gold—she was very beautiful. Her skin was like the pale,
                  amber-colored satin; her forehead low and broad; her nose straight, with thin,
                  expanded nostrils; her mouth, small and exquisitely formed, was rendered more
                  beautiful by the white, even teeth, which the slightest smile revealed; her eyes,
                  full of intelligence and spirit, were softened by long eyelashes, and crowned by
                  brows so evenly arched and black that the old men used to laugh, and call her the
                  "daughter of the two bows;" the head was exquisitely poised on her slender and
                  graceful neck, and covered with a magnificent suit of glossy black hair, which she
                  wore simply parted, and gathered together in a massive plait, which was coiled
                  around, and fastened to the back of her head with a silver arrow, a present from a
                  schoolmate, while she was at the convent school of Notre Dame, in Montreal.</p>
               <p>The crimson blood blushed softly in her cheek, like the sun-tints in a ripe
                  September peach, and her lips were as ruddy as the holly berries that glisten in
                  coral richness amidst the snows of the Canadian forests.</p>
               <p>Yes, Coaina was very beautiful, and I am particular in describing her, because her
                  young life was so fully offered to Him who fashioned and formed her wonderful
                  loveliness, and modelled so perfectly on the virtues of <emph>her</emph> whom,
                  from all eternity, He had predestined to be the Mother of His Divine Son.</p>
               <p>Coaina was dressed according to the manner of her people. She wore a short skirt
                  of blue and white striped woollen, and a soft doeskin jacket, curiously
                  embroidered with beads. Her moccasins were also cunningly wrought in gay devices,
                  and her leggings of scarlet cloth were finished with a<pb n="14-15"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000010"/> gay little fringe of feathers at the seam. Yet over
                  all there was such a charm of modesty that, had she been a veiled vestal, the
                  influence of her purity could not have been more felt and acknowledged. Around her
                  neck, suspended by a finely wrought silver chain—the gift of the good sisters of
                  Notre Dame to their pupil—Coaina wore a medal of the Blessed Virgin and a
                  crucifix, which she prized beyond all of her earthly possessions, and which, as
                  she stood in the chapel door, glittered in the sunlight, as, moved by the pulses
                  of her heart, they reposed on her bosom.</p>
               <p>"There, Coaina, will these be enough?" cried a lad, throwing open a blanket
                  containing thousands of pine blades, odorous with balms, which were to be spread
                  over the chapel floor.</p>
               <p>"Not quite enough," she replied. "Father Etienne likes the floor well covered,
                  Piquet; you will run back to the pines for more."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>did</emph> want to go to my rabbit snares to see how many rabbits I've
                  caught," said the Indian lad; "all the rest got rabbits yesterday, and I got
                  nothing but a musk-rat."</p>
               <p>"Well, Piquet, if you care more for rabbits than you do for our Mother's festival,
                  begone!" said Coaina, gravely. "We will get some one else to serve Father Etienne
                  at Mass to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> care for the rabbits, Coaina, but I won't give up the festival.
                  Redpath's boy and two others have gone into the forest with their bows and arrows,
                  and won't be back until night; but—but—" and the boy's dusky face flushed, "but I
                  want to do something for our Mother!"</p>
               <p>"That's brave, Piquet," said Coaina, laying her hand gently on the black elf locks
                  of the boy's head. "You'll be a great hunter some day. The Great Spirit will bless
                  you, because you have courage to do what is right. Run off now to the pines, and
                  fetch me as many blades as the blanket will hold, and then, Piquet, the day after
                  to-morrow you shall go with me into the forest to hunt." Just then she saw
                  approaching the young chief Tar-ra-hee, the hereditary sachem of her people, and
                  she turned swiftly and resumed her labors in the chapel.</p>
               <p>"Winonah, will you fetch in the flowers and mosses which the lads have brought?"
                  said Coaina to a young Indian girl who was busied about the shrine of our Blessed
                  Lady. The girl came forward with an impatient air, and, although she bore a family
                  resemblance to Coaina—being her cousin—no two persons could have been more unlike.
                  Winonah's eyes were fierce and defiant, with a certain wild yet repellant beauty
                  in them her brow<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6299-00000011"/> wanted the breadth and
                  serenity of Coaina's, and her handsome mouth wore a proud and scornful expression.
                  Her attire, without being immodest, displayed in its gaudy, flaunting style a
                  vitiated fancy, and a vain, ambitious nature. Trinkets glittered in her ears, on
                  her wrists, and around her slender ankles, while in her black hair she wore
                  jauntily an eagle's feather, the <hi rend="i"/>totem of her father, who had been
                  one of the great chiefs of their people.</p>
               <p>"Why not fetch them yourself, Coaina? "she asked, sharply, "she asked, sharply,
                  "or make the boys bring in the baskets?" At this moment she caught sight of
                  Tar-ra-hee, who lingered still about the chapel door, and suddenly smoothing the
                  frown from her brow, she hastened forward, and, without seeming to observe his
                  presence, began coquetishly to gather in the flowers.</p>
               <p>"See, Coaina!" she said, "these asters and crimson berries will make such a lovely
                  wreath for OurLady."</p>
               <p>"I think these will be more beautiful, because they are pure and white like her,"
                  said Coaina, gently, as she held up the white violets.</p>
               <p>"No, they will not do at all, "answered Winonah, to whose intense chagrin the
                  young chief had moved away without noticing her; "I won't have them; the crown
                  must be rich in color, and glow around her head like flames of red and gold. Oh,
                  what acrown I will make!"</p>
               <p>"What is the dispute, my dear children?" inquired a voice which was gentle, but
                  quick and firm in its tones. Both girls started, as, turning they beheld Father
                  Etienne; who had approached unseen, standing near them. Both knelt, asking his
                  blessing—Coaina with head bowed, Winonah with eyes cast down, but with her head
                  proudly erect.</p>
               <p>"Now, my dear children," said the good priest of the mission, "what is the
                  difficulty? Speak, Winonah, my child! "With a flushed cheek, Winonah told him
                  frankly of the difference of opinion between herself and Coaina about the garland,
                  without explaining, however, the secret cause of her jealous and angry
                  interference, and showed him the flowers of her choice, and those of Coaina's.</p>
               <p>"Make garlands of yours, my child, and festoon the mossy walls of our Blessed
                  Lady's shrine, they will indeed look rich and brilliant there, "said Father
                  Etienne, gently; "but <emph>these</emph> must crown her—these fair and modest
                  flowers, so symbolic of her pure holiness. Yes, Coaina, my child, you are<pb
                     n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6299-00000012"/> right—make of them a rare garland, to
                  crown and honor her on the Feast of her Assumption. So far, everything is
                  beautifully arranged—ah—yes—the banner is just in the right place. "See, children,
                  that the floor is well strewn with pine blades," added Father Etienne, looking
                  around with an air of satisfaction, after which he walked away, blessing the
                  children who were grouped around the chapel, who clung to his hands, and the
                  skirts of his long <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soutane</foreign> as long as he would
                  stay.</p>
               <p>"Now," said Winonah, when he was well out of hearing, turning to her cousin with
                  an angry countenance, "as you rule here, tell me what I am to do."</p>
               <p>"Let us help each other, sister," said Coaina, gently.</p>
               <p>"It was my wish to make the wreath for our Mother," said Winonah.</p>
               <p>"You shall make it, Winonah. I was coming to ask you, because I have the
                  tabernacle to dress, and so many other things to do."</p>
               <p>"No; if I can't make a fine flaming wreath of the flowers that I like, I shall
                  have nothing to do with it—you can make it yourself, and do the other things
                  beside, "replied Winonah, tossing her proud head.</p>
               <p>"As you wish, my sister, only let us have the chapel ready for the morrow," said
                  coaina. "Come children, bring in the flowers and mosses, and let us all work
                  together." And with good will they all obeyed her directions, for she was the
                  directress of the sanctuary, chosen by the vote of the congregation from among her
                  young companions for the office, on account of her piety, docility, modesty and
                  amiability.</p>
               <p>But Winonah had no intention of leaving the decorations of the chapel entirely in
                  the hands of Coaina, to hear on the morrow, from every lip: "Coaina made that!"
                  "Coaina hung those garlands!" "Coaina, and none but she, could have made our
                  chapel so beautiful!" "what would become of us without Coaina to decorate it for
                  the festivals!" and a thousand other expressions of the like character. She had
                  vented her angry spite on her cousin, and now she would, to please her own sinful
                  vanity, take part in the preparations, and only do that portion of the work which
                  was agreeable to herself. In a few moments she was busy twisting vines around the
                  cedar pillars which supported the roof of the chapel; now she climbed lightly to
                  the rafters, and hung the cross-beams with festoons of green, from which were
                     suspended<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6299-00000013"/> the scarlet trumpet-flower
                  and wild grapes, until Solomon's Temple, with all its precious carvings, and
                  traceries of fruit and flower, was not more beautiful. Still tripping along the
                  rafters, with the agility and lightness of a bird, she added a cluster of
                  golden-rod here, of the crimson-tinted sumack there, of white <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">immortelles</foreign> here, of wild roses there, weaving in the
                  asters and other flowers with cunning skill among the green leaves and graceful
                  tendrils of the vines, until her task was finished. "Oh, how beautiful! Winonah,
                  how beautiful!" exclaimed Coaina, as turning from the tabernacle, whose decoration
                  she had just completed, she looked up and saw the really charming effect produced
                  by Winonah's taste.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid," was Winonah's ungracious reply, "that Father Etienne will not like
                  it, so long as you did not do it."</p>
               <p>"Never fear that, my sister," answered Coaina, in the simplicity of her heart; "it
                  is more beautiful than anything I could do."</p>
               <p>As the sun declined toward the west, the arrangements for the morrow were nearly
                  completed. The floor was strewn with blades of the odorous pine, every footstep
                  that pressed them distilling a subtle aroma; the altar was a glowing mass of
                  verdure and flowers. Our Lady's grotto had been lined with fresh mosses, a coronal
                  of white violets encircled her brow, and a white lily, found among the sedges of
                  the lake, was placed in her folded hands. The front of the grotto was draped and
                  festooned with vines bearing rich hued flowers, among which, half hidden by the
                  leaves, hung the wicker cages, containing birds, who uttered sweet wild notes of
                  wonder, as they fluttered in their airy prisons, to be captives until to-morrow
                  eve, when the festival would end—then, at the chapel door, amidst the laughter and
                  happy converse of the children of the congregation, Coaina would unfasten the door
                  of each cage and release them, giving them freedom, air, sunshine and their homes
                  far off in the depths of the forest. This joyful little ceremony generally closed
                  the festival days of the mission, and was particularly enjoyed by the young people
                  of the congregation.</p>
               <p>But the last glittering rays of the setting sun shoot between a gorge in the
                  hills, and sparkle here and there like sacramental lamps—now upon the jeweled
                  folds of the mission banner, now upon the gilded door of the tabernacle, now upon
                  the burnished head of the crucified Christ, now creeping like a flame along the
                  silver fringe of the altar<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6299-00000014"/> cloth. A quiet
                  and solemnity now reign where so short a time before was heard a busy hum. Here
                  and there kneel groups of those who, having completed the preparations for the
                  festival, now examine their consciences for confession. Coaina knelt close beside
                  the shrine of the Blessed Lady, partly concealed by the flower-wreathed pillars
                  near it. Amidst this devout silence, Father Etienne enters with the most Blessed
                  Sacrament, which he deposits in the tabernacle, while every head is bowed low in
                  adoration of that grand and mysterious Presence. He now takes his seat in the
                  confessional, and soon is heard the low whisperings of penitent hearts, as one
                  after another approach the tribunal. Dim shadows, thrown by the purple twilight,
                  steal in at the open door, and with them come the old and young of the mission,
                  walking silently and reverently, wrapped in their toga-like blankets; their dusky,
                  grave faces, and long black hair, hanging loose about their shoulders, their
                  noiseless motions and immobile features adding to the solemn effect and sacred
                  repose of the consecrated place. The women knelt apart from the men, clustering
                  around the shrine of the Blessed Virgin, their little children kneeling beside
                  them, lisping their innocent prayers—all modestly attired, and all devout, save
                  one, who, tall and shapely, and of a proud, haughty demeanor, knelt in a
                  conspicuous place, where the trinkets in her ears, and the tinselled embroidery of
                  her mantle sparkled brightly in the light of the sanctuary lamp, while her eyes,
                  large and restless, roved critically and inquiringly around her, showing that her
                  heart was but little in unison with the whispered prayers on her lips, as she
                  slipped the beads of her rosary rapidly through her fingers. This was Altoninon,
                  the mother of Winonah, and the aunt of Coaina, whom she had adopted in her
                  orphaned infancy, and reared in her own lodge. Some one in a distant part of the
                  chapel arises to approach the confessional, and when she sees that it is
                  Tar-ra-hee, the young chief, she no longer looks around, but with an expression of
                  satisfaction appears to recollect herself and attend more devoutly to her prayers.
                  Thus it was within the mission chapel, but outside, wrapped in their blankets,
                  stood two forms, their sharp, piercing black eyes scanning the scene within, while
                  an expression of contempt and disgust pervaded their countenances. One was very
                  old, and was named Ma-kee (Knife). He was by descent half Huron, half Algonquin,
                  and had never been baptized, but lived peaceably among the Christian Indians of
                  the mission, some of whom<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6299-00000015"/> were his near
                  relations. The other was a dissolute, handsome and unbaptized young Iroquois
                  chief, from the neighboring village, called Ahaeek (the Deer), who, having heard a
                  rumor of the preparations, had come down to the Algonquin village to see what was
                  going on, hoping that he should, by some chance, get a glimpse of Coaina, whose
                  beauty and grace had made a profound impression upon him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">COAINA.</head>
               <p>THE Festival of the Assumption closed with the singing of the Litany of Loretto by
                  the congregation, the sacred melody being led by the powerful and flute-like voice
                  of Coaina. Swelled to a volume of rich sound, the holy chaunt floated out upon the
                  calm evening air, its solemn echoes lost, in low reverberations, in the shadowy
                  forest. Purple shadows, cast by the mountains, lay upon the lake and shore while
                  the pines and firs along the ridges were fringed with the gold of sunset. Ere
                  long, the inhabitants of the village assembled in a grove surrounding the great
                  lodge, where the chief men were accustomed to hold council, and debate on any
                  question which arose respecting the interests of their people. The chiefs and the
                  old men, with Father Etienne in their midst, sat around the door of the lodge,
                  placidly smoking, telling traditions of the old fierce wars with the Hurons and
                  Mohawks, going over again the thrilling adventures of their great hunting
                  expeditions to the northwest, or listening to Father Etienne's thrilling
                  narratives of the early French missions in Canada. Old Ma-kee, over whose head the
                  snows of nearly eighty winters had fallen, formed one of the group. Seated upon
                  the grass near Father Etienne, wrapped in his blanket, with his chin upon his
                  breast, he listened. He seldom spoke, for as he declared, "his breast was heavy at
                  the degeneracy of his people, who had become women;" and when he did, it was to
                  scoff at the new creed they had adopted, which he emphatically called the "smoke
                  of foolishness." But the claws and fangs of the old lion were gone; he was
                  harmless, and out of christian charity he was allowed a place of honor among his
                  people, with a comfortable support, in the hope that, ere he died, his pagan
                  darkness would pass away, and he, at least, receive the purifying sacra-<pb
                     n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6299-00000016"/> ment of baptism. Ma-kee had great faith
                  in, and respect for, Father Etienne, whom he knew to be a brave as well as a good
                  man; but he did not hesitate to tell him, on occasions, that there was no reason
                  or sense in what he taught, because no man could understand it. And in this the
                  old pagan was no worse than the materialists of this, our day, who reject the
                  mysteries of faith because their human reason cannot reduce them to its own level.
                  Father Etienne was relating the marvellous escape of the French missionaries,
                  nearly two centuries ago, and many of their catechumens, from the house of Saint
                  Mary's, of Ganentaa, just when the Onondagoes had conspired with the Mohawks to
                  massacre every soul of them. He described, with great spirit, the ingenuity and
                  courage of the missionaries in effecting their escape, and the speechless
                  amazement of their foes when they found the house so mysteriously abandoned. All
                  listened with profoundest interest, the twinkling of keen black eyes and an
                  occasional grunt of approval expressing their delight. When Father Etienne ceased
                  speaking, old Ma-kee lifted up his head and spoke: "My grandmother," he said
                  slowly, "remembered John Brebeuf. She was a Huron. When he was dying under the
                  torture; when his fingers and thumbs were cut off; when he was pierced with
                  lighted splinters, torn with scourges and hacked with hatchets, many of the
                  prisoners around him, who had likewise been tortured all night, begged him for
                  baptism. He had no water; none would give him a drop. The day dawned; at sunrise
                  they were all to be put to death. The prisoners begged for baptism; there was not
                  a drop of water. Brebeuf lifted his hands and eyes to the Great Spirit and prayed.
                  Just then, my grandmother, very young at that time, came from the fields with her
                  arms full of maize stalks. The long leaves and tassels were dripping with dew; it
                  hung upon them like rain-drops. He saw it, and asked her for one of the stalks. He
                  spake our language. She had helped to torture him, but she was a woman. She gave
                  him two or three. He grasped them with joy; he bade the prisoners look up; he
                  sprinkled them; he signed the cross in the air over their heads with the maize,
                  and so they were baptized with the dews of heaven and his own blood. I think that
                  was enough. But Brebeuf was a brave man. He died like a warrior; he should have
                  been an Indian, ugh!" Having spoken, the dusky old pagan wrapped his blanket about
                  him, and again dropped his head upon his breast, leaving his<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000017"/> hearers variously affected by his simple and true
                  narrative.</p>
               <p>At some little distance from the great lodge, and nearer the lake, were the women,
                  the young people and children of the village, standing or sitting in picturesque
                  groups under the trees and along the shore. Some exercised themselves by running,
                  dancing and leaping; others sought amusement in more quiet ways, while many played
                  simple games with shells and plum-stones, peculiar to their customs. Blithely
                  arose their cheerful voices in pleasant converse and innocent laughter, while each
                  face wore a look of contentment and enjoyment. We said that every face wore a glad
                  expression; that was a mistake, for Altontinon, who sat apart from the rest,
                  gorgeously attired, as usual, looked dissatisfied; but no queen ever wore her
                  royal robes more proudly than she wore her coronal of blue and scarlet feathers,
                  her necklace and earrings of silver beads, and her embroidered scarlet moccasins
                  and mantle. She was the widow of the deceased sachem of her people, and, in
                  default of a son to inherit the dignity and title, had the mortification of seeing
                  it pass to the son of her husband's brother, the present chief, Tar-ra-hee, whose
                  baptismal name was Cyril. Bitterly disappointed, and obliged to bear, not only her
                  own mortification, but that of her kinsmen, it became a grave consideration how to
                  retrieve the loss. The idea suddenly presented itself to her scheming mind, one
                  day, to marry her daughter, when of a proper age, to Tar-ra-hee. Once admitted,
                  this idea became the ruling motive of her life; she was prepared to sacrifice
                  everything to its accomplishment, and so pledged herself to her kinsmen, who gave
                  it their hearty approval. Altontinon kept up a kind of state around herself, which
                  no one cared to interfere with; for although she was a Christian, she was not a
                  saint; in fact, so far from being a saint, she was—I don't know whether there is a
                  name in any Indian dialect for it—but, in plain English, she was a termagant. This
                  woman had taken Coaina, who was left an orphan at a very early age, and nursed her
                  at her breast with her own child, who was, to a day, of the same age. Strange to
                  say, she had loved Coaina, and although she stormed at her now and then, and set
                  her to drudgery that she spared Winonah, she was, upon the whole, kind to her. In
                  the perilous journeys of the tribe to the distant hunting grounds, so full of
                  hardships and privation, she cared as tenderly and constantly for the young Coaina
                  as for Winonah, and ever took the<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6299-00000018"/> same
                  pains in teaching her those arts and accomplishments so necessary to the complete
                  training of an Indian girl. Coaina was skillful and expert in them all. She
                  excelled all of her young companions in domestic handicraft; she was more expert
                  in dressing skins and dying quills and feathers; more skilful in fishing and
                  hunting; more agile in running and climbing; more ingenious in embroidering and
                  fashioning the garments, which she made with such celerity; and more quick in
                  acquiring knowledge from the books she was permitted to read than any young person
                  in the village. Her school tasks were never neglected; her religious duties never
                  omitted, and as she grew towards womanhood, there was developed in her character
                  so much purity, virtue and excellence, that she was not only the favorite of the
                  village, but was constantly held up by parents to their children as a model for
                  their imitation. She, unconscious of her superiority, was so modest and
                  affectionate, so generous and cheerful that, with the exception of one, no heart
                  felt malice, envy or ill-will towards her, and that heart was Altontinon's, who
                  had noticed all this with ever-increasing discontent, and whose chagrin was now
                  completed by the fact that Coaina had become far more beautiful than Winonah;that
                  she was more intelligent and <emph>more beloved</emph>. Here was a cloud, and from
                  it dropped the very gall and wormwood of bitterness into Altontinon's soul. Then
                  arose the fear or presentiment that the superior attractions of her niece would
                  frustrate all of her plans for her child's union with Tar-ra-hee. Henceforth her
                  jealous misgivings gave her no peace, and on several occasions, when she fancied
                  indications on the part of the young chief of admiration for Coaina, she became
                  almost frenzied with rage. Coaina felt keenly the change in her aunt's conduct
                  towards her, and although her un-kindness cost the poor child many a bitter tear,
                  she remained dutiful and patient, bearing all her humors with sweetness and in
                  silence, and sought refuge and consolation only at the feet of MARY, towards whom
                  she had ever cherished the most reverent and tender devotion, by whose life she
                  had modelled her own, and whose gracious assistance she constantly implored. About
                  this time Coaina was placed, by Father Etienne, at the head of the female
                  confraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, a position which Winonah expected
                  and hoped to receive. This added fuel to the flame in the heart of the mother and
                  daughter, who, by many a sneer, taunt and slight, aroused every in-<pb n="32-33"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000019"/> dignant emotion in Coaina's nature, and rendered
                  her life almost unendurable.</p>
               <p>But as the storms and rains of March vivify and strengthen the roots of the forest
                  trees, so did these tempests of ill-will and malice, which beat so perpetually and
                  harshly against her, strengthen her soul, vivify her faith, and sweeten with
                  eternal fragrance the sweet blossoms of humility that had such deep root in her
                  soul. Then arose another cause of bitter envy and jealousy. On a certain occasion
                  the two girls were permitted to go, with a party of their kinsmen, to Montreal to
                  sell their bead-work and feathers. Father Etienne gave them a letter of
                  introduction to the Superior of the Convent of Notre Dame, who not only received
                  them kindly, but introduced them, at the hour of recreation, to the
                     <emph>religious</emph> of the house, and also to the lady pensioners of the
                  academy. The beauty of the two Indian maidens, the artless grace and modesty of
                  Coaina, the proud mien and wildly bright eyes of Winonah, their excellent French,
                  their low, sweet modulated voices and unsophisticated expressions, won upon every
                  heart. The lady pensioners were half wild with admiration of these beautiful
                  Algonquin princesses, and purchased everything in their baskets, besides making
                  them presents of pictures and little ornaments in gold and precious stones, which
                  they took from their own ears and fingers.</p>
               <p>Not very long after this visit, Father Etienne received a letter from the lady
                  superioress of this convent, in which she spoke of the visit of Coaina and her
                  cousin, and after expressing the most friendly sentiments towards both, offered to
                  receive Coaina at the academy as a pensioner for six months; at the expiration of
                  which term, she would also receive Winonah for the same period. After due
                  consultation with her friends and kinsmen, it was agreed that Coaina should accept
                  the advantages offered by this kind invitation, and Father Etienne accompanied
                  her, himself, to Montreal. Altontinon would have prevented it, had she dared, but
                  she had made up her mind, that in all that she intended doing to carry out her
                  plans, no agency of hers should be apparent; she was too proud, and prized the
                  position she held too highly, to be willing to lose caste, so she gave a cold
                  assent to Coaina's going, while she fumed in secret, and poisoned still more
                  Winonah's mind against her innocent cousin. She told her, under a sacred<pb
                     n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6299-00000020"/> promise of secrecy, all that she designed
                  to do for her advantage, and found in the ambitious girl a willing ally.</p>
               <p>Coaina was very happy in Montreal. Every one in the convent loved her, and took
                  great pains in assisting her through her tasks. Quick and appreciative in
                  everything they taught her, above all she showed such a passion for music, and so
                  astonishingly was her talent developed by a little instruction, that she was
                  regarded almost as a prodigy. Her voice was of such surpassing sweetness and
                  compass, so full of a certain <emph>wild life,</emph> that ere long she was,
                  permitted to sing in the chapel choir, where, her heart overflowing with the love
                  of Jesus and Mary, she sang the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Salve Regina,</foreign>
                  with such sweetness and fervor that the notes soared and floated with thrilling
                  effect above the grand thunder tones of the organ.</p>
               <p>When the six months had expired, the good Sisters of Notre Dame would fain have
                  detained her; they were unwilling to lose their beautiful favorite, but she
                  desired to go, that she might take the place of Winonah in her aunt's lodge, and
                  be to her indeed a daughter, in the place of her absent child. So she returned to
                  the "Lake of the Two Mountains," and to her home, the same humble- minded,
                  light-hearted, simple child as she left; and forgetful of the past, she remembered
                  only the debt of gratitude she owed her benefactress, and determined to be more
                  scrupulous than ever in the discharge of the duties she owed her. There was great
                  joy in the village when she came back. Old and young had a pleasant greeting for
                  her; Father Etienne gave her his blessing with his welcome; the children brought
                  flowers and birds for her acceptance, and the old pagan Ma-kee lifted up his head
                  and said: "The sunshine has come back to us, and the song of birds. It is
                  good."</p>
               <p>"Winonah was kindly received at Notre Dame, but having no talent for music, and
                  but little aptitude for study, the little she gained served but to increase her
                  self-conceit and vanity; and at the expiration of her term, she was full of anger
                  and ingratitude against the good <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Religieuses,</foreign>
                  because she had failed to learn what they found it impossible to teach her. This,
                  so far from imputing to her own want of capacity, she charged to their
                  indifference. This added fresh zest to the hatred of Altontinon for the innocent
                  Coaina; but she dared not, as we said before, brave public opinion by open acts of
                  violence to her; therefore, like the wild, malicious woman she was, she bided her
                     time,<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6299-00000021"/> and watched for her opportunity
                  to give crushing effect to her revenge.</p>
               <p>Thus matters stood in the village of the "Lake of the Two Mountains," up to the
                  day on which our little narrative opens, and we are happy to say that no more
                  digressions will occur, having put our patient readers in possession of all the
                  necessary facts to enable them to comprehend as mournful a tragedy as was ever
                  written, crowned by as saintly a martyrdom as the world ever knew.</p>
               <p>Altontinon sat alone, still watching her daughter, who was sporting with other
                  girls of her age on the margin of the lake, and wondering what had become of the
                  young chief, Tar-ra-hee, whom she had not seen since Vespers. Her keen, restless
                  eyes had been seeking him for the last half hour, but as yet he had not appeared,
                  either among the chief men at the grand lodge, or with the young people on the
                  shore. She became impatient, and was about to rise up from her seat, to walk round
                  in search of him, when some one suddenly approached her, and asked, in a quick,
                  impatient tone: "Altontinon, where is Coaina?"</p>
               <p>She started round, and Tar-ra-hee, the young chief, stood before her.</p>
               <p>"Is she not with her companions down there by the lake?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"I will go and seek her!" he replied.</p>
               <p>Now old Ma-kee, walking slowly, approached her and asked: "Where is Coaina?"</p>
               <p>"Ask me where your grandmother's ghost is?" she said, sharply. "I do not know
                  where she is."</p>
               <p>"Altontinon, your rattles grow finely," replied the pagan, moving on.</p>
               <p>"Where is Coaina, my child?" inquired Father Etienne. "I have not seen her since
                  Vespers."</p>
               <p>"I have not seen her for more than an hour, my father. Perhaps she is in the
                  chapel," she replied, more respectfully. He went away. Group after group of young
                  people approached, one after the other, all making the same, inquiry.</p>
               <p>"We are waiting for her to begin blind man's buff," said one.</p>
               <p>"We are waiting for her, to dance. Tar-ra-hee is asking for her," said
                  another.</p>
               <p>"We want her to sing for us?" said the children.</p>
               <p>"We can't get along without Coaina!" cried one.</p>
               <p>"Everybody wants her! where is she?" screamed another.</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6299-00000022"/>
               <p>Almost beside herself with fury, Altontinon, who restrained herself with
                  difficulty, professed to be entirely ignorant of the whereabouts of Coaina, and
                  she was finally left alone, but not long; for presently little Tony straggled up
                  and asked the so oft-repeated question: "Where is Coaina?" and received for answer
                  a rousing slap, full on the side of his tawny cheek, which sent him roaring away.
                  Soon after, Tar-ra-hee came back, his gay feathers nodding over his head, his
                  silver ornaments, and a gold medal sent him by the English queen, glittering in
                  the last glimmer of sunset—so full of life and courage, so graceful and noble in
                  his bearing that, for an instant, Altontinon was lost in admiration; but his words
                  recalled her to her own train of thought, and again plunged her into the abyss of
                  her own malicious intentions, for he asked if she had yet seen Coaina.</p>
               <p>"I have not seen her; can't the stars shine without Coaina? can't the wind blow?"
                  she answered, in suppressed rage.</p>
               <p>"No, the stars do not shine for me when Coaina is away," replied the young chief,
                  with a proud nod." It grows always dark."</p>
               <p>"Coaina no longer heeds me; she is beginning to have lovers. Ahdeek, the Iroquois,
                  has been around my lodge lately. Perhaps if you can find him, Coaina will not be
                  far off," said Altontinon.</p>
               <p>The young chief started and turned upon his heel, stung sharply, but too proud to
                  question his tormentor. Altontinon thought, "he will now seek Winonah," and
                  watched eagerly to see if he went towards her, but he strode off in quite another
                  direction, and she lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Tar-ra-hee wandered listlessly and moodily on, heedless of whither he was going,
                  when he suddenly halted and bent his head in a listening attitude; then a gleam of
                  joy lit up his swarthy features. He was within a short distance of Altontinon's
                  lodge, and had heard Coaina's voice singing, in low sweet tones, one of the hymns
                  of the mission. He sprang forward, and swiftly made his way thither. It was,
                  indeed, Coaina, seated at the door of the lodge, with the soft moonlight falling
                  upon her upraised face. She heard advancing footsteps; the next moment Tar-ra-hee
                  stood beside her. A deep blush crimsoned her cheeks; she arose and saluted him,
                  with downcast eyes.</p>
               <p>"I have come for you, Coaina. Your companions await you on the shores of the lake.
                  Come!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Did my aunt send for me?" she asked.</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6299-00000023"/>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"I cannot come: do not wait."</p>
               <p>"I will wait. You shall come!" he said quickly.</p>
               <p>"Cyril!" exclaimed Coaina, who always called him by his christian name.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Coaina; come!" he pleaded.</p>
               <p>"No; I cannot go. You must return to them.</p>
               <p>"I shall stay here," he said, in a determined tone.</p>
               <p>"Don'—don't! you must go away!" she said, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>must</emph> go away!" he said, angrily. "Do you send others away? Why
                  must I go?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Cyril, go, and do not be angry, my friend," she said, while big tears rolled
                  over her cheeks.</p>
               <p>"I have something to do—a duty which I must not neglect—and should you stay away
                  and be found here with me! ah, Cyril, don't you see how ill it would look?"</p>
               <p>"Listen, Coaina," said the young chief, gravely;</p>
               <p>"I will obey you now, but give ear to my words, and open your heart to take them
                  in. My lodge is empty, and before another moon I will rise up in the council, and
                  ask for you to be my wife."</p>
               <p>A soft blush suffused Coaina's lovely face, and a dreamy smile chased the tears
                  from her eyes, but she only said: "Go, now, Cyril, my brother; leave me."</p>
               <p>"I go, Coaina," but when the moon rises to the height of yonder red star," he
                  said, pointing to one overhead, "you will hear my flute not far off from the
                  lodge; will you listen to what it tells, Coaina?"</p>
               <p>"I will listen, my brother," she promised. Then he turned, and moving swiftly
                  away, was lost among the shadows of the night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE SHADOWS OF THE STORM.</head>
               <p>THE exultant gleam faded from Altontinon's eyes, for no sooner had Tar-ra-hee left
                  her than she felt that her anger had got the better of her craft; and if she
                  wished to succeed in her wicked designs, it was a most impolitic way to begin by
                  offending him.</p>
               <p>On that very day she had inaugurated her malicious work. She had positively
                  forbidden Coaina to leave the lodge that evening, and had uttered a slander
                  against her to Tar-ra-hee, by coupling her name with that of Ahdeek, the Iroquois,
                  which she<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6299-00000024"/> was crafty enough to know
                  would, at some time or other, help to serve her purpose. She watched his
                  retreating figure, satisfied that at least she had prevented him form seeing
                  Coaina that evening; but when she saw, in the distance, that he turned into a lane
                  of cedars which led to her own lodge, her baffled rage almost suffocated her. "He
                  would see Coaina," she thought; "he will find out that her absence from the
                  innocent enjoyments of the evening was compulsory, and having discovered this,
                  would suspect <emph>her,</emph> and give no credit, henceforth, to anything she
                  might assert to Coaina's injury."</p>
               <p>The longer she sat there brooding over the failure of this, her first steps
                  towards the accomplishment of her ambitious scheme, the more intense grew her
                  hatred, and forgetting that All-Seeing Eye, before which the profoundest secrets
                  of the soul are nakedly unveiled, forgetting all the divine teachings and claim of
                  religion, forgetting death and the judgment, she vowed, with a bitter curse, that
                  she would succeed in what she had undertaken, even if Coaina's reputation and life
                  be the sacrifice.</p>
               <p>But her guilty fears were somewhat lulled to rest when, later in the evening, she
                  again saw Tar-ra-hee among the young folks, and observed that he showed much
                  attention to Winonah, who exerted all of her coquettish wiles and arts to charm
                  him.</p>
               <p>The moon had arisen, full and unclouded, over the mountain, and everything
                  glistened in her rays as if frosted with silver. The festival was over, and the
                  people were returning to their peaceful homes.</p>
               <p>Altontinon, well pleased at the notice bestowed upon her daughter by the young
                  Algonquin chief, walked slowly homeward, full of thought concerning the advantages
                  of a marriage between them. Winonah tripped along lightly over the dewy turf, a
                  little in advance of her mother, whose eyes watched lovingly the gracefully moving
                  form, whose every motion threw out sparkles and flashes from the spangles and gold
                  fringes which adorned her tunic and moccasins. How she loved the girl, but how
                  savage and pagan was the love which gave birth to sins which would incur the
                  displeasure of God, and wound afresh the tender hearts of Jesus and Mary. It is
                  said that when a soul voluntarily seeks <emph>evil,</emph> the prince of evil is
                  ever ready with opportunities to serve its purpose, and so it seemed to be on this
                  occasion.</p>
               <p>Among the Iroquois who lived in the adjoining village, there were some few who,
                  rejecting Christ,<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6299-00000025"/> preserved their own
                  heathenish traditions, clung to the ancient customs of their ancestors, and, it
                  was whispered, practiced in secret their idolatrous rites. But as they were
                  peaceable, and observed all the civic rules of the mission, and interfered in no
                  way with their christian kinsmen or people, their presence was tolerated, in the
                  pious hope that, after a season, they might be induced to follow their example.
                  Among these was their hereditary chief, Ahdeek, (Reindeer,) who had often
                  distinguished himself in their great hunting expeditions, and excelled in all
                  those accomplishments most highly prized and appreciated by the Indians. Ahdeek
                  was handsome, vain, passionate, and it was said that he was dissolute in his
                  habits. He had frequently seen Coaina, and had, in various ways, endeavored to win
                  a smile from her, by expressing his admiration by signs, gifts and words; but she
                  had invariably repulsed every advance he had made, and turned from him with a
                  frown of displeasure whenever he ventured to approach her; but all this only
                  incited him to more persevering efforts to win her.</p>
               <p>On the evening of the festival he had strolled down towards Altontinon's lodge,
                  with scarcely a purpose except to be near the home of Coaina, for he supposed her
                  to be absent at the festival, when, to his great joy, he saw her standing in the
                  moonlight, leaning against the moss-covered stile that led to the lodge. She was
                  reciting the rosary, her eyes fixed on the cloudless heavens, and thinking that,
                  as the moon was throned in glittering beauty among the luminous stars, so was the
                  Blessed Virgin throned in heaven, and surrounded by the glorious angels, whose
                  queen she is. It was a consoling and beautiful thought, and as they twinkled and
                  trembled in dewy splendor, flashing out rays of crimson, blue and gold, Coaina
                  almost imagined that she saw the flutter of their glorious wings as they bowed
                  before their queen.</p>
               <p>"Left all alone, like a wild pigeon in the empty nest! I am glad to see you,
                  Coaina," said the audacious Iroquois, who had approached her unseen and
                  unheard.</p>
               <p>"Ahdeek!" exclaimed Coaina, starting; "I wish you well, but you must go away this
                  instant. I am all alone."</p>
               <p>"That is good; now I can <emph>say</emph> to you, face to face, what you are blind
                  and deaf to in signs. I love you."</p>
               <p>"Esa! Esa! shame on you! Ahdeek, leave me!" she cried.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6299-00000026"/>
               <p>"I will become a Christian, Coaina, if you will hear me!" he plead.</p>
               <p>"To become a Christian will be a glorious thing, Ahdeek! but go; Father Etienne
                  will instruct and baptize you."</p>
               <p>"No; I learn the Christian creed from you or none. I thought you Christians would
                  give your life to save a soul."</p>
               <p>"So would I lose mine to save your soul, Ahdeek, but I shall never enter your
                  lodge; I can never be more to you than a friend. I will pray for you. You must now
                  go away," and Coaina turned from him and swiftly entered the lodge, while he,
                  baffled and angry, strode off, almost knocking Altontinon down, he came so
                  suddenly against her. She, as keen-eyed as a vulture, had seen him, as she
                  approached her lodge, talking with Coaina. At first she thought it was Tar-ra-hee
                  standing at the stile, but when she discovered it was Ahdeek, the Iroquois, she
                  said: "Aha! Yes!" and rejoiced in her wicked heart, because she knew that his
                  having been there would help her evil plans; then asking Ahdeek if "he kept his
                  eyes in his pocket that he might run people down in his path," she went into her
                  dwelling, and calling Coaina, assailed her with the most violent abuses; affecting
                  to believe that she had received the Iroquois as her lover in her absence, she
                  uttered the most injurious insinuations, nor would she listen to Coaina's
                  explanations, but pretended to be outraged and grieved and horrified at her
                  conduct, called her a hypocrite, and finally struck her in the face.</p>
               <p>Almost stunned by the injustice and violence of her aunt's conduct, Coaina,
                  without attempting to speak another word in her own defense, withdrew to her own
                  little apartment, and dropping the curtain of skins which separated it from the
                  rest of the lodge, she threw herself prostrate upon the floor before the blessed
                  images of Jesus and Mary—of Jesus, in His bloody coronal of thorns—of Mary, of the
                  seven dolors. She watered the floor with her tears; she offered her griefs to
                  them, and finally found consolation in the generous resolve she made to suffer
                  patiently all the unmerited reproaches she had received, for them who had suffered
                  so willingly ten thousand more infinite and bitter griefs for her.</p>
               <p>At last, her head resting upon her arm, she fell asleep, and was refreshed by the
                  dreams of innocence. Once only did she awake. She had dreamed of her dead mother,
                  as she sometimes did, and thought she was singing a soft lullaby to<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000027"/> her, whose strange, unearthly melody thrilled
                  through her heart, and awoke her. At first, she did not know whether she was awake
                  or still dreaming, for she heard, while the whippowil sent his lamentations abroad
                  through the forest, and the screech owl answered in shrill vibrations, the sweet
                  wild notes of a flute, breathing assurances of a pure affection. Then she
                  remembered Tar-ra-hee's promise, and while a soft glow stole over her tearstained
                  face, she commended herself to the protection of the Blessed Virgin and fell
                  asleep.</p>
               <p>Like a fair prairie blossom agitated by the morning winds, and scattering, in
                  prodigal brightness, the dew-drops from its rich petals, so Coaina threw off the
                  sense of ill which oppressed her when she first awoke. The first red beams of the
                  newlyrisen sun shone through the vines that partially shaded her window, and
                  bathed in light the sacred images of Jesus and Mary, which stood upon a little
                  shelf at the foot of her bed. "My Holy Mother and Advocate," she murmured, folding
                  her long, tapering hands together as she knelt before them, "look at thy divine
                  Son, and obtain for me a patience like unto thine."</p>
               <p>Her simple toilet was soon made, and hurrying out to the chapel she knelt in her
                  favorite place, close beside the altar of the Blessed Lady, and assisted at Mass
                  with the greatest devotion. Between the sweet and glorious mystery of the altar
                  and the benign presence of Mary, Coaina's whole being reposed, as in a safe haven,
                  secure from the rude storms that threatened her.</p>
               <p>Tar-ra-hee served Father Etienne at the altar that morning, as he was frequently
                  in the habit of doing, and it was a touching sight to see this noble young savage
                  bowing in such sweet subjection to Christ; to see his strong arms folded in meek
                  and childlike devotion; his proud, handsome head bowed, in unquestioning faith,
                  before the Lord of lords, whom he received humbly and reverently under the form of
                  Bread.</p>
               <p>For several days nothing occurred to interrupt the tranquillity of the Village of
                  the Lake. Altontinon behaved to Coaina with a certain grave displeasure, and when
                  she addressed her, spoke in a tone so harsh and sneering that she was deeply
                  pained; but feeling innocent of offense and guiltless of crime, she omitted none
                  of her duties, and persevered in all her accustomed attentions to her aunt and
                  cousin, hoping, by patience to overcome evil, and by prayer to turn their hearts
                  forgivingly towards her. She observed that Altontinon had<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000028"/> many and long secret conferences with several of
                  her kinsmen and friends, and was surprised, once or twice, to see her in close
                  conversation with Ahdeek, the Iroquois.</p>
               <p>Tar-ra-hee had not approached her since the night of the Festival of the
                  Assumption; she only heard his flute, now and then, under the trees around the
                  lodge, and except that Father Etienne and her friends around the village greeted
                  her as kind as ever, and the little children gathered about her and hung upon her
                  skirts whenever she appeared among them, she would have indeed felt
                  friendless.</p>
               <p>The clouds were gathering around her, and their shadows were discerned by her
                  delicate and sensitive perceptions; she knew not whence they were coming, or in
                  what storms they would burst; she trembled with the chill that often swept over
                  her; she felt that no mortal could help her in this mysterious coming woe; but the
                  darker grew her dread, the closer she clung to the shelter of the sanctuary, the
                  oftener she fortified her soul with the divine sacraments, and with more constant
                  fervor did she kneel at the feet of Mary, imploring her gracious protection.</p>
               <p>But one day the clouds seemed suddenly to dis- perse, and again streamed the
                  sunshine into Coaina's heart. Father Etienne walked into Altontinon's lodge while
                  herself and daughter were partaking of their evening meal, and Coaina, who was no
                  longer permitted to eat at the same board with them, sat apart, busily engaged
                  upon a piece of needle-work. Each one arose to welcome him; he returned their
                  salutations with a cheerful air, and taking the chair placed for him, he drew it
                  to the side of Coaina, and sat down. Altontinon's guilty heart was agitated by
                  this unexpected visit; but when the good priest announced the object of it, she
                  felt as if a bolt of ice had suddenly fallen upon it. "I have not only brought you
                  my blessing today, my good children," he said, "but also most excellent tidings.
                  This morning, while the assembly were in council, deliberating about the sale of
                  some lands on the St. Lawrence, which they finally decided not to sell, Tar-ra-hee
                  stood up and declared his intention to make our child here, Coaina, his wife, and
                  asked the consent and approval of all present, including myself. There was not a
                  single voice raised in dissent against it; in fact, there was a murmur of
                  satisfaction very audible, for we all knew, Altontinon, how precious is To-hie to
                  her people. They are all proud of their 'rose,' and<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000029"/> each one felt that the young chief's choice of a
                  bride was not only a wise one, but a special pleasure to each individual present.
                  When I was called upon for an opinion—sit still, Coaina—I not only hastily
                  approved of Tar-ra-hee's choice, but assured him, before all present, that in such
                  a union he would find all the good and happiness that, humanly speaking, one could
                  expect; after which," continued Father Etienne, laying his hand gently upon
                  Coaina's bowed head, "the assembly ratified its solemn approval and formal
                  consent, and I hurried here to be the first to bring the joyful news to your aunt,
                  and give my blessing to the betrothed of the good and brave Tar-ra-hee."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my father, for your goodness," she said gently, and without lifting
                  her modestly downcast eyes; "Cyril is generous, but it is best, my father, not to
                  hope for too much. I have sometimes seen," she said, lifting her great soft eyes,
                  and looking before her with a strange, far-off expression, "the day which rose the
                  brightest close in wild, wintry tempests."</p>
               <p>"Coaina, my child, these are dreams. It is the christian's duty to receive with
                  joy and gratitude whatever good our Father sends, without throwing a veil of cloud
                  and doubt over His gifts," said Fa- ther Etienne, cheerfully; but many and many a
                  time since has he remembered her looks and words that day.</p>
               <p>"I will try, my father, to be grateful—to be dutiful; but there's something," she
                  said, passing her hand over her forehead and eyes, "there's something like a
                  mist—I don't know what it is, but it seems to shut out the sunshine."</p>
               <p>"Coaina," said the good father, "if you were a pale-face, I should say you have
                  the <emph>vapors.</emph> You have been keeping in-doors too much of late, and
                  stooping too long at a time over this everlasting bead work and stitching.
                  Altontinon, see to it, or we shall have a burial instead of a bridal."</p>
               <p>"I will see to it, my Father," replied Altontinon, with a double meaning; then
                  dissembling with a self-possession worthy of a better cause, she rallied Coaina
                  while she congratulated her, and pretended to be highly delighted at the alliance.
                  "Leave her with me, my father," she continued, "she is only coy—you know how
                  modest Coaina is—she has to think a little while—where a girl has two or three
                  lovers, it is difficult to decide all at once—"</p>
               <p>"My father," said Coaina, in response to Father Etienne's look of inquiry, "I have
                  no lover—that is, I shall be the wife of Cyril, or none. He is all<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000030"/> that I could ask or desire." Coaina knew that her
                  aunt meant mischief by this hint, and that she referred to Ahdeek, the Iroquois;
                  she therefore answered as she did, with a slight hesitation, because she
                  remembered that Ahdeek had presumed to call himself her lover; and such was the
                  tender and sacred regard which this young Algonquin maid had for the truth, that
                  she would not fully deny her aunt's statement, lest she should thereby offend the
                  truth.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my child, cheer up! You have a happy future ahead. Altontinon, hurry
                  the wedding preparations, for I am sure Tar-ra-hee will not desire a very long
                  delay," and Father Etienne, giving but little thought <emph>then</emph> to what
                  had passed during the interview, hurried up to the Iroquois village to one or two
                  sick persons who needed his ministrations.</p>
               <p>The news flew through both villages, in an incredibly short time, that Tar-ra-hee
                  had chosen the Rose of the Algonquins for his bride. Coaina received the hearty
                  congratulations of old and young, of friend and foe, until she, to escape their
                  friendly jests, and the incessantly repeated good wishes of those who constantly
                  crowded to see her, generally slipped away from them, and by a back path found her
                  way to the chapel, to offer her newly-found happiness to the Blessed Virgin, and
                  hide her modest blushes in the shadow of the sanctuary. We spoke of Coaina's
                  "friends and foes." It is marvellous that so pure and lovely a nature should have
                  a foe; but alas! it is a world old story how virtue ever excites malice; beauty,
                  envy; prosperity, covetousness; and felicity, hatred and ill-will; so, after all,
                  it is not strange that our Rose of the Algonquins had her enemies who, to conceal
                  their plans for her ruin, assumed the guise of friendship, and were loud in their
                  protestations of delight at her good fortune.</p>
               <p>Never was happiness and prosperity borne with greater modesty. The cloud that had
                  shadowed her heart seemed to have passed away. Altontinon and her cousin were more
                  kind, and the strong, protecting love of her betrothed, gave her a feeling of
                  tranquil happiness. No duty was left neglected; no kindness left undone; no
                  pleasure or assistance that she could afford was withheld. Skilled, as we said
                  before, in hunting and fishing, she brought the choicest dainties of the lake and
                  forest to her aunt's lodge, and so deftly did she perform all her tasks, so
                  important had she become to Altontinon's comfort and Winonah's whims, that her
                  aunt began to<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6299-00000031"/> feel what a terrible loss
                  Coaina would be to her! This was another incentive to her to carry out her selfish
                  and malicious plots against the guileless maid, for whose approaching marriage the
                  most splendid preparations known to these primitive people were in progress.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">"BEWARE OF THE SNAKE, TO-HIC."</head>
               <p>IT is well for the reader of this narrative to keep this fact in view: that had
                  the young chief of the Algonquins united himself in marriage with Winonah, it
                  would have increased the dignity and consequence of her mother's family, as it
                  would have secured to them the chieftainship and grand <hi rend="i"/>totem of the
                  tribe. Bitterly disappointed in their ambitions and selfish aspirations, angry and
                  distrubed in mind, they were prepared to unite with Altontinon in any plan she
                  might suggest to them to break off a marriage so disastrous to their schemes of
                  arrogance and pride. It seems strange to associate the vices of civilization with
                  the characters of an Indian story; but believe me, friends, that human nature,
                  unless wonderfully dignified and hallowed by grace, is the same latent savage
                  everywhere, which only requires circumstances, in a greater or less degree, to
                  rouse him from his lair in the heart to seek his greed or revenge. Let us not,
                  then, be too much surprised, however much we may feel grieved at the depravity of
                  these disappointed people, or deem incredible the events which follow. It was not
                  long before whispers began to float about to the injury of Coaina, which at first
                  only excited a scornful expression of denial from her friends. She, all
                  unsuspicious of the plots against her happiness, was as blithe as a bird,
                  wondering often, in her sweet humility, why she should be so blessed! Her eyes,
                  like a young doe's grew softer and more luminous, and her voice, ever trilling in
                  sweet cadences, like the wild birds of the forest, became more low and gentle, and
                  was only heard when her full heart sought to give expression to her grateful
                  happiness, singing the beautiful litanies and touching hymns of the mission.</p>
               <p>Not the least rejoiced of all her friends was old Ma-kee, the unbaptized, who
                  would sit watching her—often in her aunt's lodge; sometimes on the shore;
                  sometimes at the door of the chapel, while<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6299-00000032"
                  /> she adorned the shrine of the Lady with flowers—his withered face wearing a
                  grave and pleased expression, and only breaking the silence to take his pipe from
                  his mouth, and say: "Ugh! it is good!" The affection of this old pagan for Coaina,
                  I have sometimes thought, in connection with her sad story, was a grace bestowed
                  upon him for that act of charity showed by his grandmother to the martyr
                  Brebeuf!</p>
               <p>Of those most enraged at Coaina's approaching marriage, was Ahdeek, the Iroquois,
                  who found a ready sympathizer in Altontinon, and readily enlisted in the service
                  to aid in the accomplishment of that which would finally throw Coaina, helpless
                  and defenceless, in his power. He was now frequently seen at Altontinon's lodge.
                  This was not agreeable to Tar-ra-hee, who, without suspecting any designs against
                  his betrothed, nevertheless so despised the low vices of Ahdeek, that he could not
                  bear to know the air she breathed was contaminated with his presence, and desired
                  her to hold no intercourse with him, but leave the lodge whenever he came into it,
                  which she invariably did.</p>
               <p>Day after day rolled on, and the month of the falling leaves had come. The frosts
                  had tinted the leaves with the most gorgeous hues of crimson and orange, which,
                  blending with green and russet, and relieved by the rich evergreens of cedar, pine
                  and hemlock, gave to the forests the appearance of a grand <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >parterre.</foreign> Nature seemed to be preparing her robes for a grand
                  festival, instead of a burial. There is something sublime in this glorious passing
                  away of summer, as if in thus gathering about her departure a splendor symbolic of
                  a glad obedience to the law of the great Creator, she offers a holocaust of
                  precious adoration, and crowned with a silvery nimbus, expires like a
                  blood-stained martyr, full of the joyful hope of a resurrection to come. Taking
                  their lessons from the dying year, it is not strange that the Indians, in the
                  primitive days should have chanted their death-song, when life was passing, their
                  eyes fixed in hope, on the setting sun, whose radiance, they believed, illuminated
                  the pathway to the hunting grounds of the Great Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Indians of the mission of the Lake of the Two Mountains, were preparing for
                  two great events—one was the marriage of their chief, which Father Etienne desired
                  should be celebrated with great solemnity, not only to impress upon his people the
                  dignity of the sacrament, but to offer to Tar-ra-hee and Coaina a tribute of
                  respect, which<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6299-00000033"/> he considered them
                  eminently worthy of; the other was the annual migration of the tribe to the
                  hunting grounds of the Northwest.</p>
               <p>The young ladies of Montreal, who had known and loved Coaina at the Convent of
                  Notre Dame, sent her a magnificent bridal present of a dress of blue velvet, made
                  in the style of the picturesque attire she wore when they first saw her,
                  embroidered with silver, and a veil of blue crape covered with spangles. They knew
                  her singular devotion to the Blessed Virgin, and thought, justly, that the present
                  would be more acceptable if composed of <emph>her</emph> colors. In the same box,
                  neatly packed, and directed to their beloved pupil, was a wreath—made by the nuns,
                  with the permission and approval of their superior—composed of delicately tinted
                  feather flowers, among which were woven clusters of Roman pearls. Directed to
                  Father Etienne's care, he no sooner opened the box than he sent for Coaina, to
                  whom he presented them with genuine pleasure.</p>
               <p>"My father," said Coaina, looking upon the costly presents spread out before her,
                  "these are very rich and beautiful! They are too fine for me. I should be ashamed
                  to wear them. I have prepared a more simple and befitting attire."</p>
               <p>"Coaina, my child, these things must be worn, according to the intention which
                  prompted the gifts. You cannot refuse to do so without appearing proud and
                  ungrateful, which you <emph>are not.</emph> If I thought they would give birth in
                  your heart to one single throb of vanity, I should at once advise you to burn them
                  up. But wear them, my child—it will please your good friends in Montreal; it will
                  please Tar-ra-hee and your people to see you splendidly dressed on your wedding
                  day. After that, you can wear them for penance, if you choose," said Father
                  Etienne, laughing. "Now take them home, my child."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my father; but something has happened—I am troubled—may I speak to you?"
                  said Coaina.</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes. But, my child, what is the meaning of all this? I confess that you
                  perplex me!" said Father Etienne, perceiving, as he looked up, that Coaina's eyes
                  were full of tears. "What is the trouble?"</p>
               <p>"There is something, I do not understand <emph>what,</emph>" she said, timidly,
                  "that causes some, who were formerly my best friends, to curl their lips at me as
                  they pass; they have no greeting for me when I salute them, but look me full in
                  the face, and, with a toss of the head, turn away."</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6299-00000034"/>
               <p>"Tut! tut! my good child! I fear that it is a little envy on <emph>their</emph>
                  part, and a little imagination on <emph>yours.</emph> Did you never hear, Coaina,
                  that when one is about to marry, all one's faults are trumped up and magnified,
                  and when one dies, all of one's virtues are only remembered. So don't give
                  yourself unnecessary trouble about one's looks. Looks can't hurt one. So that your
                  conscience is clear, and each duty performed with a view to the approval of
                  Almighty God, why should you be disturbed? Go home, my child, assured that
                     <emph>she</emph> who is the 'Help of Christians' will be your refuge and
                  protection."</p>
               <p>"That is my hope!" she replied, with a smile that irradiated her countenance—"that
                  is my hope!" Then, kneeling, she received Father Etienne's blessing, and went away
                  loaded with the rich gifts which she was to wear at a supreme moment, but not as a
                  bride. She had never hinted to Father Etienne anything relative to the unkind
                  treatment which she had for a long time received from her aunt and Winonah,
                  because she not only feared to wound charity thereby, but believed, in her
                  humility, that all she suffered was due to her unworthiness; nor had she ever
                  referred to her annoyances about Ahdeek to him, not caring to trouble him about
                  trifles; and in fact, although the effect of these annoyances was so disagreeable
                  and serious a matter to her, there was scarcely anything tangible or grave enough
                  in them to justify an appeal to Father Etienne; he was, therefore, at that time,
                  entirely ignorant of all the undercurrent of deceit and wickedness that was going
                  on, to the prejudice of Coaina. Altontinon and Winonah approached the sacraments
                  regularly. Alas! yes; they dared to approach the august feast of the altar, as
                  Judas did; they dared invite Jesus Christ into their hearts, which were the abode
                  of devils; they dared again to crucify Him by their malice towards His faithful
                  servant, who, in return, prayed for them night and day, and frequently offered her
                  worthy communions for their temporal and spiritual good.</p>
               <p>One evening, Coaina, having remained later than usual in the chapel, where she had
                  received much consolation in prayer, returned home, and found her aunt and Winonah
                  in raptures over a superb mantle of mole-skins, fringed richly with gold, and
                  lined with cloth. Coaina had never seen anything which struck her as being so
                  magnificent, in her life, and she expressed her admiration with simple
                  earnestness, without once inquiring to<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6299-00000035"/>
                  whom it belonged. If she thought about it at all, her idea was that it belonged to
                  her aunt. What, then, was her surprise when Altontinon threw it over her
                  shoulders, saying: "Tar-ra-hee knows how to make princely gifts to his bride. The
                  Queen of England might be proud of this."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how I wish I were you, Coaina!" exclaimed Winonah, clasping her hands.</p>
               <p>"For me! Oh, it is too grand, too costly for me! When was Tar-ra-hee here?"</p>
               <p>"This afternoon, while you were at the chapel. He will not be back until to-morrow
                  evening. He has gone, in his canoe, to fish, up the Ottawa, and the word he left
                  is that you meet him on the shore when he returns, with his gift, this superb
                  mantle, about you," said Altontinon.</p>
               <p>"How foolish is Tar-ra-hee to have me make a show of myself," she said, with a low
                  laugh, as she smoothed the velvety fur with her small dusky hand. "I shall,
                  however, do as he wishes; really I am ashamed of such grand finery."</p>
               <p>"It is not too fine for the bride of our sachem, Coaina! Why, gold, and silver,
                  and precious stones, would not be too grand for <emph>you!</emph> But what have
                  you got there?" said Winonah.</p>
               <p>"Something which I will show you by and by," replied Coaina, who had felt
                  Winonah's sneer, and then, gathering up the mole-skin mantle with the other things
                  which she held in her arms, she retired to her own apartment. Then Altontinon and
                  Winonah embraced each other, laughed and danced as if they were wild, and making
                  other signs expressive of triumph, pointed towards Coaina's apartment with
                  fiendish glee.</p>
               <p>The next evening Coaina folded the mole-skin mantle and hung it upon her arm, then
                  threw a gray cloak about her in such a manner as to conceal its gold fringes and
                  scarlet lining, and was about leaving the lodge to go down to the lake to wait for
                  Tar-ra-hee, when her aunt accosted her with a discomposed look.</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, Coaina?"</p>
               <p>"To wait for Cyril, as he left word," she mildly answered.</p>
               <p>"Oh! But where is the mantle? He was very particular in his wish for you to wear
                  it," said her aunt, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"I have it here," replied the unsuspecting girl, as she lifted her cloak, that
                  Altontinon might see it. "I could not wear it through the village with-<pb
                     n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6299-00000036"/> out exciting too much observation, so I
                  thought I would put it about me after I got down to the lake."</p>
               <p>"Such modesty!" said Altontinon, scornfully. "Little hypocrite, leave off that
                  gray cloak this instant, and wear Tar-ra-hee's gift, as he bade you. He shall not
                  be dishonored by having his wishes, as well as his bridal present, slighed in that
                  way. Shame upon you." Then Altontinon snatched the grey cloak from Coaina's
                  shoulders, shook out the superb mole-skin mantle, and before Coaina, in her
                  surprise, could offer the slightest resistance, she had put it around her, and
                  fastened the showy gilt clasps over her bosom. "Now go," she added, "you are too
                  poor-spirited to be the wife of our chief."</p>
               <p>What was it that, like a strain of clear music, suddenly whispered to Coaina's
                  heart: "<emph>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
                     heaven?</emph>" She could not tell, but, repeating the words to herself, she
                  walked from the lodge, forgetful of all else, while her eyes wore that same
                  far-off expression which we have before described. She did not see the scornful
                  looks directed towards her, or the low-uttered sneers as she passed the various
                  groups collected in front of the lodges in the village, on her way to the lake;
                  still less would she have understood them even had she seen them.</p>
               <p>The soft music of the waves rushing swiftly to the shore, and melting upon the
                  sands—the cool, crisp wind, and the broad track of gold and crimson light thrown
                  across the lake by the declining sun, roused Coaina from her far-off dreams, or
                  rather from her introverted communings; and, selecting a sheltered seat upon the
                  gnarled roots of an ancient maple, whose branches, laden with scarlet leaves,
                  leaned down and partially swept the surface of the lake, she folded her hands upon
                  her knees, and awaited the coming of Tar-ra-hee. At the length, afar off, and in
                  the very midst of the sun's golden track, his canoe appeared upon the dancing
                  waters; nearer and nearer it sped like an arrow, under the sinewy strength of the
                  young chief's arms. Coaina could now see the paddles flashing in and out of the
                  water, looking as if they were plated with burnished gold; then they were drawn
                  in, and Tar-ra-hee stood up, his symmetrical form showing in noble relief against
                  the bright sky; his eye swept the shore; Coaina waved a bright scarf with which
                  she had covered her head; he made a glad gesture with his hands, again resumed his
                  seat, and by a<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6299-00000037"/> few vigorous strokes of
                  the paddles brought his birchen canoe gliding swiftly up upon the sands. Securing
                  some of the finest and largest of his fish, he sprang upon the shore and hastened
                  towards Coaina, who, with a smile of welcome, modestly advanced to meet him, when
                  he suddenly halted—his face flushed crimson, and an angry scowl darkened his
                  features.</p>
               <p>"Cyril!" said Coaina, timidly.</p>
               <p>"Thou art fine to-day, Coaina, too fine for the bride of an Algonquin Christian,"
                  he said, scanning her for a moment with grave scorn, from head to foot, then
                  passed on with quick, angry step. Here was sudden darkness for Coaina! His own
                  gift, worn at his own command to show her value for it, to excite such cruel
                  anger! It was a mystery which was inexplicable to her. Tears gathered in her eyes,
                  her hands trembled, and she was obliged to sit down while she tried to unclasp the
                  mantle. Bewildered and grieved, she returned slowly homeward, the mantle hanging
                  upon her arm, and when she was once more within the solitude of her own little
                  apartment, she tossed it into an obscure corner, and, with a feeling of
                  desolation, knelt, weeping and sorrowful, to lay her griefs where she had ever
                  offered her joys, at the feet of Jesus and Mary. By and by she grew more composed,
                  and began to hope for the best. Guileless herself, she suspected no evil in
                  others—far less did she imagine the existence of any base designs against her.
                  After a while Altontinon came in under pretence of borrowing a needle, and asked:
                  "Did Tar-ra-hee come?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he came," replied Coaina.</p>
               <p>"Were you there in time to see him?"</p>
               <p>"I saw him."</p>
               <p>"How did he think his bride looked in that royal mantle?" asked Altontinon, with
                  an evil glitter in her eyes.</p>
               <p>"I believe he thought it, after all, too fine," she said, looking down.</p>
               <p>"The unreasonable! But, child, it was no use to cry about <emph>that.</emph>
                  Tar-ra-hee is only like all other men—none are constant," said Altontinon, with a
                  sneer.</p>
               <p>"I think that Cyril is. Nothing can shake my faith in him. We must not judge him
                  rashly," said Coaina, gravely.</p>
               <p>"I won't dispute the point with you. Settle it yourself. But did you hear that
                  there's great sickness among the Iroquois?"</p>
               <p>"No, Poor people! What is it?"</p>
               <p>"A sort of dreadful fever. Father Etienne has<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000038"/> gone up there to baptize some of them who are
                  dying. It is worse up near the forest, where the unbaptized ones live."</p>
               <p>"Ah, may God bring them safely into His fold before their departure!" exclaimed
                  Coaina, forgetful of her own sorrow, as she thought of the needs of the dying.</p>
               <p>"And," continued Altontinon, "that filthy pagan, Ahdeek, has been here blubbering
                  like a woman, and looking like a scare-crow, because his mother is ill and won't
                  let the medicine man come in to her. Then he told me to ask you to talk to the
                  WHITE MOTHER for her."</p>
               <p>"I will, most gladly," said Coaina, who was only too happy to be engaged in a work
                  of charity. Then she bathed her face, and wrapping her gray cloak about her once
                  more, started to go down to the chapel to pray for the sick, and particularly
                  implore the assistance of the Blessed Virgin for the conversion of Ahdeek's dying
                  mother. Near the chapel she met old Ma-kee, who stopped her to inquire where
                  Tar-ra-hee was.</p>
               <p>"At his lodge, I suppose, Ma-kee. He has just returned from fishing."</p>
               <p>"He is not there, To-hic. He started an hour ago for Montreal," said the old
                  Indian. "Ugh! Black clouds open their wings in the face of the sun sometimes. It
                  is nothing strange—but beware of the snake, To-hic; beware of the deadly moccasin
                  creeping in the grass!" Then Ma-kee wrapped his dirty blanket about him, and crept
                  on.</p>
               <p>"What is this shadow that comes darkening my heart?" thought Coaina. "I thought it
                  was gone forever, but I feel the chill of it again. O, Great Spirit," she cried,
                  prostrating herself before the altar, "Thou sendest us joy; Thou sendest us
                  sorrow; whatever Thou doest is right; only keep me by the hand while the danger
                  passes; let me cling closer to thee, sweet Mother of Jesus, that I may not perish
                  in the dark waters!"</p>
               <p>Two or three days passed by, and Coaina saw but too plainly that her people looked
                  askance at her. Some refused to notice her at all—others returned only a haughty
                  nod to her salutations, and once, when she met Father Etienne, she imagined that,
                  although he spoke kindly, he received her with a stern and troubled expression of
                  countenance, neither stopping, as usual, to say a pleasant word, or lay his hand
                  upon her head in blessing. Even the little children began to shrink from her, and
                  stood back, gazing wonder-eye'd at her, when-<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000039"/> ever she addressed them, or sought to gather them
                  about her. She felt bewildered by the strangeness of it all, but Father Etienne
                  had told her that perhaps "it was half envy on the part of others, and half
                  imagination in herself"—therefore it might be so; she would not resent it, but
                  bear it patiently, in the good hope that GOD would accept her humiliation, which
                  she offered in the true spirit of penance, in satisfaction for the many faults of
                  her life, and in His own good time disperse the cloud which gathered so loweringly
                  over her. Altontinon and Winonah were jubilant, and affected to be extremely kind
                  to her, while Coaina, nothing doubting their sincerity, received their
                  extraordinary attentions with gratitude, and felt comforted that they at least
                  clung to her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">LURED INTO THE SNARE.</head>
               <p>EVERYTHING wore a change for Coaina—everything except the consolations afforded
                  her by the divine sacraments. There was no change there. Untainted by the world,
                  for whose salvation they were established, neither time, malice nor all the powers
                  of hell combined can shake them from their eternal foundations, or strip them of
                  the least of their attributes. Not of the "earth, earthy," they never fail those
                  who are faithful to them, and though all mankind stand against the soul, they,
                  with infinite generosity, undying compassion, unselfish constancy, and prodigal
                  love, encompass it round about, never ceasing their consoling ministrations, until
                  that soul has reached the end of its thorny pilgrimage, and passed the portals of
                  death to its everlasting reward.</p>
               <p>Coaina realized the truth of this in a wonderful degree, for the more her "kinsmen
                  and friends stood aloof," the more constantly did she seek rest<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000040"/> for her wounded spirit in the life-giving
                  sacraments, and shelter her troubled mind in the shadow of the sanctuary. She
                  could understand nothing except that a time of tribulation had come upon her; she
                  could do nothing save put her trust in the justice and mercy of God, and the
                  tender compassion of MARY, and patiently await the result.</p>
               <p>One day after confession, Father Etienne asked her "if she had ever received any
                  gifts from Ahdeek, the Iroquois?"</p>
               <p>"Never, my father."</p>
               <p>"Do you often see Ahdeek, Coaina?"</p>
               <p>"Sometimes, at my aunt's lodge."</p>
               <p>"Nowhere else?"</p>
               <p>"Never, my father. Why should I?" Ahdeek is nothing to me."</p>
               <p>"Very well; I do not see why I should doubt your word, Coaina."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my father," she replied gently. "My tongue never lies."</p>
               <p>"Be careful, my child, that it never does," said Father Etienne. Then after a
                  pause, he added: "There are evil reports abroad concerning you, Coaina; I doubt
                  them all, and shall continue to do so until their truth is proved. If false, you
                  are reviled without cause, and God Himself will succor you; if true, then, my poor
                  child, you are guilty of the most detestable hypocrisy. Being only man, I cannot
                  read your soul, and in the absence of proof of your guilt or innocence, I dare not
                  withhold the sacraments from you. The responsibility rests, then, upon your own
                  soul. Go in peace."</p>
               <p>She would have spoken, but a sob choked her utterance, and rising from her knees
                  she hastily left the confessional, and fell, rather than bowed, at the feet of the
                  image of the Immaculate Mother. She could not fashion the anguished emotions of
                  her soul into words; she felt, like her divine Saviour, all the bitterness without
                  the guilt of the things whereof she was accused, and of which she was yet
                  ignorant. Low sobs expressed her bitter suffering, and every tear she shed was an
                  eloquent appeal to the compassion of God, as she knelt there, the innocent victim
                  of the malice of her enemies.</p>
               <p>No prayer ever uttered by prophet or saint can compare with the adoration of a
                  speechless woe, which resigns itself in dumb resignation to the Divine will. His
                  face may be hidden for a while by the cloud which veils it, but He is ever near;
                  and when His designs are accomplished, He disperses, by a single breath, the
                  shadows which hid Him,<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6299-00000041"/> and lifts up the
                  fainting soul with tender consolations, ofttimes crowning her with glory and
                  eternal honor.</p>
               <p>Where was Tar-ra-hee? He had returned from Montreal, and remained at home a week.
                  One evening Coaina, after decorating the shrine of the Blessed Virgin with a
                  garland of rich flowers which she had that day gathered in the forest, knelt down
                  to recite the Rosary. While she dropped bead after bead, she thought of the
                  sorrows that had crowned and pierced the immaculate heart of MARY, feeling all the
                  time the sting of her own strange grief, until tears gathered in her eyes and
                  rolled over her flushed cheeks. A quick, soft step entered the chapel, and then
                  some one knelt, unperceived by her, not far from her. Covering her face with her
                  hands, she bowed her head, resting it on the feet of the pure image of the Virgin
                  Mother, and murmured: "Thou wilt not forsake me, my Protectress and Mother. Be
                  thou my friend and consolatrix; then if all the world forsake me, what need I
                  fear?" Her devotions over, she was about leaving the shrine, when some one touched
                  her lightly upon the shoulder, and a familiar voice uttered her name in a low
                  tone. She turned quickly, recognizing the voice, and saw Tar-ra-hee regard- ing
                  her with a grave and sad expression of countenance. A crimson blush mantled her
                  face; she stood suddenly still, while her tearful eyes rested with a wild and
                  startled expression on his face. He walked to the side door of the chapel, where
                  thick vines drooped over a sort of trellised work, forming a vestibule screened
                  with leaves and flowers, and beckoned her to him.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, Cyril," she said, standing before him with her hands
                  folded, and her eyes modestly cast down.</p>
               <p>"Is that what you also say to Ahdeek?" he asked, gravely.</p>
               <p>"Who, Cyril? The Iroquois? I am never glad to see <emph>him.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But you receive his gifts, Coaina!"</p>
               <p>"I have never received aught from Ahdeek," she said quickly.</p>
               <p>"And never see him—and never go to the forest to meet him?" exclaimed
                  Tar-ra-hee.</p>
               <p>"Never, Cyril. What could have poisoned your heart to believe such a dreadful
                  thing?"</p>
               <p>"Coaina, I thought, a few moments ago, when I saw you kneeling there so humbly,
                  your head bowed like a magnolia flower after the storm, that you must be innocent,
                  or you dared not pray. My<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6299-00000042"/> heart melted
                  like the ice in the Ottawa, when the warm spring tides break it up, and I only
                  thought of my love for my betrothed. But Coaina, what you say is not white; it is
                  a lie."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Cyril—Cyril, my brother!" she cried, in anguish; "tell me what you mean! What
                  have I done?"</p>
               <p>Then he told her about the mole-skin mantle. Ahdeek had shown it to him months
                  ago, and told him it was to be worn only by his promised wife, and for that he was
                  reserving it. He told her how unworthy Ahdeek was, and how blighting to a virtuous
                  reputation was all association with him. Then he told her how his joy had suddenly
                  turned into anger and mourning the day he returned home from fishing, and found
                  her waiting on the shore for him arrayed in Ahdeek's gift.</p>
               <p>"And was it not <emph>your</emph> gift, Cyril? My aunt—" then a divine charity
                  closed her lips.</p>
               <p>"Did any one tell you it was from me, Coaina?"</p>
               <p>"I thought so, Cyril; it was left for me. I thought it was <emph>your</emph> gift,
                  and I wore it that evening to show you how much I valued it," she said earnestly,
                  while the truth declared itself in every line of her now pale face.</p>
               <p>"Is this true, Coaina?" he asked, sternly.</p>
               <p>"Our Blessed Mother is my witness that it is!" she replied, making a gesture with
                  her hand towards the shrine. "Cyril, fearing the Great Spirit whose eye sees all,
                  I dare not lie to thee, my betrothed.'</p>
               <p>"Poison has touched my heart," he said, looking down into the innocent and
                  truthful face uplifted to his. "To-morrow, Coaina, I will see you again in the
                  presence of your aunt, and if any have calumniated you, they shall answer to me
                  for it." And as he spoke, the troubled and gloomy expression of Tar-ra-hee's eyes
                  gave place to one more gentle and tender.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my brother," she replied, and, was about to leave him when Altontinon
                  bustled into the rustic vestibule, outside of which she had stood, and not only
                  watched them through the leaves, but overheard all that passed, and said to Coaina
                  in an agitated tone:</p>
               <p>"Hasten home, Coaina; my child is ill. I fear the Iroquois fever is upon her. I am
                  going to Makee's lodge for herbs."</p>
               <p>"I will go, aunt; I hope Winonah is not ill of the fever," she answered gently,
                  while a dawning smile once more gave serenity to her features.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>go!</emph>" thought this malicious woman; "it<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000043"/> is all over for you, although you seem to think the
                  sun is rising once more." Tar-ra-hee had re-entered the chapel, and was kneeling
                  before the altar during this short conference; and when Coaina, after a rapid
                  walk, reached home, she found Winonah apparently ill of a burning fever, moaning
                  and tossing on her pillow, as if in the greatest pain. Had Coaina but turned down
                  the coverlid, she would have seen that Winonah was surrounded by heated bricks,
                  which almost consumed her, and produced all the effects of violent fever. But so
                  innocent and guileless was this saintly child of the forest, that she never
                  suspected any one of deceit or wrong; indeed, so full was her heart of a divine
                  charity, that she only thought of concealing the faults of others, even when she
                  discovered them.</p>
               <p>The most criminal of all lies are those which are garnished here and there with
                  the truth, making a plausible array of facts which can scarcely be contradicted
                  without making the truth suffer, by dragging it through the mire of
                  misrepresentation and falsehood, into which malice has plunged it. Never
                  suspecting the practical lie before her, Coaina, in the simplicity of her heart,
                  set about making her cousin comfortable. She gathered balm leaves from the garden
                  and made her a refreshing drink, and bathed her head with cool water from the
                  spring; she bound plantain leaves about her wrists and darkened the lodge, after
                  which she arrayed everything neatly, and spread the table for the serving meal. In
                  her happiest moods she always liked flowers about her, and now that her interview
                  with Tar-ra-hee gave her a promise of returning tranquillity, she gathered a rich
                  cluster from the aster and chryssanthomun bushes, which cluster around the doors
                  and windows of the lodge, and set them in the midst of the table. It was quite
                  twilight by the time she completed her arrangements. Winonah seemed to be
                  sleeping, and Coaina went to the door to await the return of her aunt, when a
                  lad—she could not distinguish his features—sprang over the stile and handed her a
                  folded scrap of paper, then ran off again with me greatest speed. It was so dark
                  that she could not distinguish a word of the writing which she perceived was in
                  it, so hurrying in, she stirred the embers, and cast into the glowing coals a knot
                  of resinous pine, which quickly kindled, and threw out a ruddy blaze which
                  illuminated every part of the room. Then opening the letter, she read:</p>

                              Two young girls are dying, and will be baptized if you will come to
                              them. Hasten.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Without waiting a moment to consider, Coaina stepped in to see if her cousin still
                  slept, and finding that she did, she wrapped her cloak about her and went forth,
                  as she thought, on an errand of charity, at the bidding of her spiritual guide;
                  but instead of that she was lured away, like a young gazelle, into the snare of
                  the hunter, to suffer the crowning effort of the malice of her enemies.</p>
               <p>That night also, Tar-ra-hee received a mysterious notification "to keep watch from
                  day-dawn until sunrise," from a cliff which was overhung by an uprooted hemlock
                  tree, that projected over the road leading to the Iroquois village, and commanded
                  a view of two or three miles extent. He was told "to expect something which would
                  unravel a mystery, and open his eyes to the truth." Troubled in heart, and full of
                  but one thought, he determined to go, hoping that the unravelled mystery would be
                  the full exculpation of Coaina.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE IROQUOIS LODGE.</head>
               <p>COAINA had no difficulty in finding the lodge designated in the letter. She paused
                  a moment to rest, having walked very rapidly, then lifted the curtain of deer
                  skins which hung over the entrance, and walked in; but she found no one there
                  except an old woman, who feebly smoked her dirty pipe as she crouched in a corner
                  upon a bed of bear skins.</p>
               <p>"Where is Father Etienne?" asked Coaina, gently.</p>
               <p>But the old squaw was deaf, and only stared at her with her bleared eyes. By and
                  by a lad came in, who, when he saw Coaina, started to run out, but she caught him
                  by the arm, and asked: "Where is Father Etienne?"</p>
               <p>"He says you must wait. He will come presently."</p>
               <p>"It is good," she answered. "But who is ill?"</p>
               <p>"Hush—sh—sh!" said the old squaw, seeing that they talked, and pointing towards
                  the inner re-<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6299-00000045"/> cesses of the lodge, which
                  were curtained off with skins.</p>
               <p>"Are they very ill?" she asked the lad.</p>
               <p>"Ugh!" replied the lad, shortly and sullenly, for he had glanced at the old squaw
                  in time to see her shaking her shrivelled fist towards him—a warning which he knew
                  from experience was not to be despised; then he slunk out of the lodge. Coaina,
                  thinking only of the object which led her there, and nothing doubting but that
                  Father Etienne would come presently, took out her rosary, and, holding it beneath
                  her mantle, began the decade of the five sorrowful mysteries; offering her
                  intention for the dying <emph>ones</emph> she had come to assist. She drew back
                  into an angle formed by the irregular wall of the lodge, and partially concealed
                  by a bark-covered cedar post which helped to support the roof, she closed her
                  eyes, and was soon lost to all her strange surroundings in her devout meditations
                  upon the august dolors of Mary. The sound of muffled footsteps, and that soft,
                  indescribable rustle of garments, roused her attention, and thinking that Father
                  Etienne had come, she unclosed her eyes, but saw, instead of Father Etienne, a
                  crowd of dusky forms, whose hideously painted faces and gaudy attire, whose keen,
                  cunning eyes and gleaming hatchets, filled her with perplexity and alarm. Among
                  them, in the centre of the group, she recognized Ahdeek. According to the ways of
                  her people, Coaina seldom showed either surprise or alarm, and now she calmly
                  arose, and stepping forward, asked once more: "Where is Father Etienne?"</p>
               <p>"He is not here, To-hic. This is a strange place to seek him," he replied.</p>
               <p>"He sent for me here. Here is his letter," said Coaina, as a cold sensation
                  thrilled through her heart. Ahdeek took the letter, while a gleam of triumph shot
                  across his swarthy visage, pretended to read it, then tore it into pieces, and
                  scattered the fragments with a scornful laugh.</p>
               <p>"So," said a leering old chief, "the Algonquin Christian can come to the lodge of
                  the Iroquois medicine man, to see Taho. What will the man of prayer say?"</p>
               <p>"I came here to see two Iroquois maidens baptized into the Christian faith. Where
                  are they? I will go to them," she replied, with an undaunted look, as she
                  attempted to pass the group of Indians, for the purpose of leaving the lodge. But
                  instantly a score of bright hatchets and knotty clubs were lifted over her head.
                  Startled and ter-<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6299-00000046"/> rified, but outwardly
                  calm and brave, she folded her hands upon her breast, and looking full into the
                  grim faces which scowled around her, she asked, in a clear and distinct tone: "By
                  what right do you hold me prisoner?"</p>
               <p>"By <emph>my</emph> will!" said Ahdeek, and every one of his dusky satellites
                  responded "Ugh!" "You have curled the lip in scorn of the chief of the Iroquois,"
                  Ahdeek went on to say; "he is strong, and not to be driven off like a dog!"</p>
               <p>"Have I ever harmed you, Ahdeek? It is not the part of a brave chief to make war
                  against a defenceless woman. Let me go free," said Coaina.</p>
               <p>"Listen, Coaina. My lodge is empty. I have no one there to light the fire upon my
                  hearth; no one to dress the skins that I take in hunting, or cook my fish and
                  venison. I need you. Be my wife. You shall have all that the daughter and wife of
                  a great chief needs. You shall not toil. You shall have the softest furs of the
                  stone-marten and fitch; your robes shall be decked with sables which I will fetch
                  from the dark Suaganay; and your couch shall be spread with the soft skins of the
                  beaver. You shall have the brightest beads, fringes of gold and silver, stuffs
                  with all the colors of the rainbow, and plenty all the year round. Will you come
                  to my lodge, Coaina?" said Ahdeek, hoping to dazzle her by his boastful
                  promises.</p>
               <p>"No, Ahdeek. No. I am already, in the sight of heaven, the spouse of Tar-ra-hee,
                  the chief of the Algonquins. Even were I not, I would not come into the lodge of
                  an unbeliever," replied Coaina, still standing bravely erect.</p>
               <p>"The chief of the Algonquins would rather marry my old grandmother there than you,
                  Coaina. The eagle will never mate with the carrion-crow. Tar-ra-hee despises you.
                  What will he say when he knows where you spent the night?" asked Ahdeek, with a
                  malicious grin.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Ahdeek," wailed Coaina, as a full sense of her peril broke upon her mind,
                  while she stretched out her hands towards him, "be generous, and let me go hence
                  in peace."</p>
               <p>"You are my captive until the day dawns. You shall have a new baptism, Coaina,
                  then I will conduct you safely home. You are safe, To-hic, unless you do yourself
                  hurt; only be quiet in the trap into which you are snared," he said. He then gave
                  a brief order to the savages around to guard the entrance to the lodge, while two
                  kept watch on each side of Coaina, watching her faintest movement. There was no
                  hope of escape, for this swar-<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6299-00000047"/> thy crowd
                  was composed of those among the Iroquois who still rejected christianity; who
                  believed in the traditionary fables of their people, the superstitious rites
                  associated with their worship; who had unlimited faith in the evil spirits of the
                  water and forest in magic and omens; who worshipped corn as a deity, and adored
                  fire; who were unscrupulous in their morals, and believed in no higher law than
                  obedience to their chief, and a due observance of their traditionary customs.</p>
               <p>"Ahdeek," she said, in a solemn and impressive tone, "Ahdeek, you have betrayed
                  me. You have snared me like a simple cony of the forest; but remember that my God
                  is powerful—that He will bring to nought your wickedness, and make you fall into
                  the pit you have dug for me."</p>
               <p>"Let Him help you now, To-hic," said Ahdeek, scornfully. "Now's the time!"</p>
               <p>"In His own good time will He deliver me. I adore His will, and await His coming,"
                  she said, clasping her hands together, and looking upwards with a gaze so
                  supernaturally bright that one would have thought her sight penetrated far beyond
                  the night, and beheld the face of the great Deliverer of whom she spoke.</p>
               <p>"She talks of the great Manito," they whispered around her. "She has the heart of
                  a warrior."</p>
               <p>Coaina saw how futile were her hopes of escape, and, with a sharp human pang, she
                  resigned herself to the bitter necessity of her situation, while she implored the
                  protection of Almighty God, and invoked the assistance of the Immaculate Mother.
                  She felt that, beside these, she had none else to fly to. She knew that on the
                  morrow she would be scorned and cast out by her people, for who would believe in
                  her innocence, in the face of such evidence, when her reputation was already
                  tainted by calumny? Her enemies had snared her, and thrown over her innocence a
                  garment of blackness which no eye could penetrate save the sleepless eye of the
                  All-seeing; which no glance of loving compassion could fathom save
                     <emph>hers</emph>—the Mother of Jesus; which all would shrink from with scorn,
                  save the angels who were given charge over her. In one sense we may exclaim:
                  "Poor, forlorn Coaina!" In another we may exclaim: "O, maiden of divine
                  predilection! honored art thou in thy sorrow and shame! they thorny griefs are
                  budding heavenly blossoms for the crown which is weaving for thee in heaven!"</p>
               <p>Thus resting in strong faith upon God's promises, Coaina's troubled heart grew
                  more calm. The rich<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6299-00000048"/> blood had forsaken
                  her face, leaving it cold and pale, and as she stood leaning against the cedar
                  post, she looked like a statue carved out of stone, so motionless and apparently
                  breathless was she.</p>
               <p>Suddenly a bright red gleam shot across her closed eyes. When she opened them she
                  saw a pyramid of faggots heaped up in the middle of the lodge, under which a fire
                  had been kindled, and now shot here and there, between the interstices of the
                  wood, red tongues of flame, which crept in and out like fiery serpents. Around
                  this fire stood, first in order, the children and young people, and behind them,
                  those more advanced in life. In the centre was the medicine man, in his grotesque
                  trappings, and hideously disguised.</p>
               <p>At a signal from him, all raised their hands; he threw a piece of deer's fat into
                  the flames, when every one present cried out, in a measured and unearthly chant:
                  "Taho! Taho!" After this, a small space was cleared by the medicine man, who now
                  produced a pouch in which there was a pipe and powder, which he called <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">potu!</foreign> The pouch was carried solemnly around the fire,
                  all chanting Taho! Taho! after which the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">potu</foreign>
                  was taken from the pouch, and distributed to all the men, who smoked it, and
                  furnigated their bodies with it as with something sacred. An Iroquois filled a
                  pipe with it, and lighting it by his own, handed it to Coaina, who, by a quick
                  movement of her hand, dashed it to the ground and placed her foot upon it,
                  exclaiming: "In the name of Christ, I trample on all idolatry!"</p>
               <p>This enraged the Indians beyond expression, and they would immediately have done
                  her violence for her contempt of a right which they held sacred, had not Ahdeek
                  interposed his authority, which they, on the present occasion, sullenly
                  obeyed.</p>
               <p>At length the dawn crept through the crevices of the lodge, and ere long a deeper
                  glow of crimson heralded the rising of the sun; then Ahdeek approached Coaina, and
                  told her she was free to go. She sprang from the lodge, like a wild doe from the
                  trap of the hunter, hoping to escape the attendance of Ahdeek, with which he had
                  threatened her, and get back in time to be present at Mass; but he, watchful of
                  every movement, was in an instant by her side, and—well named the Deer—easily kept
                  pace with her swift footsteps. Glorious was the rising of the red and golden light
                  out of darkness; brilliantly fell the splendid rays upon the hoarfrost, which
                  glimmered like myriads of tiny crys-<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6299-00000049"/> tals
                  on the grass and leaves; joyfully dashed the scarlet-crested woodpecker from tree
                  to tree; a low warbling echoed fitfully and sweetly among the gorgeous foliage of
                  the forest; and here and there, chattering over their forage, the grey squirrels,
                  with feathery tail erect, scampered up and down the branches. Nature smiled,
                  rejoicing over the birth of this new day, which was so full of sorrow to the young
                  Indian maiden, now hastening homeward, all heedless of the brightness around her,
                  and compelled to bear the presence of her enemy, who kept close behind her,
                  determined not to separate himself from her until the eyes of all the village had
                  witnessed her shame. Suddenly an object standing on the edge of a projecting rock,
                  and half hidden by an overhanging hemlock tree, arrested Coaina's attention; she
                  shaded her eyes with her hand, and looked intently for an instant, then, uttering
                  a low cry, she stretched her arms towards it, but it disappeared in the shadow of
                  the forest, flitting away like a mist before her eyes. Then she fell fainting to
                  the ground. It was Tar-ra-hee!</p>
               <p>Altontinon had sought him the evening before, and told him, with protestations of
                  reluctance, and had even shed tears, that the Iroquois held that night the
                  festival of Taho; that she had good reason for knowing that certain of their
                  people would be present, and advised him, as chief of his tribe, to watch and see
                  if any baptized Algonquin attended it secretly—then she hinted at her hidden
                  griefs about Coaina, darkly intimating things which she declared she dared not
                  disclose. This interview following so close upon the mysterious billet he had
                  received, aroused in Tar-ra-hee's mind the most suspicious vigilance. He could not
                  sleep, but long before dawn took his station upon the overhanging rock we have
                  described, and there waiting patiently, with a dull, heavy misgiving at his heart,
                  he at last saw Coaina emerge from the Iroquois lodge, attended by Ahdeek. It
                  needed no more to convince him that Coaina was not only false to him, but that she
                  had lived a most hypocritical life, and was unworthy of a regret. He was a
                  christian—he would not, therefore, revenge himself upon the Iroquois by taking his
                  life; he would formally and publicly annul his betrothal to Coaina, and leaving
                  her to the punishment her crime deserved, go away from the tribe, to hunt along
                  the shores of the dark Sauganay.</p>
               <p>This was the conclusion which, after long and silent congitations, he arrived at;
                  then he sought Father Etienne, and laid bare his heart before him;<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000050"/> after which he privately consulted with the chief
                  men of his people, and notified them to meet in solemn assembly the next day.</p>
               <p>Pause an instant, reader, whether young or old, and reflect on the evils of
                  malice, slander and rash judgment. We have seen how innocent Coaina was, how truly
                  pious and unblemished was her life before heaven; and yet we behold her clothed
                  with depravity as with a garment, a despised and rejected outcast; wearing all the
                  appearance of guilt and hypocrisy, through the <emph>pride, malice,
                     ambition</emph> and <emph>envy</emph> of others, who, still esteemed and
                  honored, triumphed for a season in their wickedness. <emph>And remember, friend,
                     this is no fiction!</emph> Coaina actually lived and suffered as our feeble pen
                  describes, and to this day the young girls of "the Lake of the Two Mountains" will
                  lead the stranger to her grave, and with fast-falling tears relate, as they twine
                  wild flowers around her place of rest her mournful story.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">LIKE A SHEEP BEFORE HER SHEARERS, SHE WAS DUMB.</head>
               <p>WHEN Coaina saw Tar-ra-hee watching from the crag, and knew that he must have seen
                  her leave the Iroquois lodge followed by Ahdeek, she felt as if some one had given
                  her a heavy blow on her head; she staggered and grew faint and dizzy; then
                  everything like brightness faded out of the air, and she fell to the earth, bereft
                  of consciousness. Ahdeek stood, for a moment, perplexed and irresolute, but an
                  idea suddenly presented itself which not only solved the difficulty of his
                  position, but turned the accident to account; so, lifting the light and insensible
                  form of Coaina in his strong arms, he sped swiftly to the village of the
                  Algonquins, passing each wondering group he met without speaking, until he reached
                  the lodge of Altontinon, who met him at the door with her hair dishevelled and her
                  face disfigured with weeping, surrounded by three or four of her relatives, who
                  all pressed silently but<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6299-00000051"/> eagerly forward
                  to look upon the pallid face lying so helplessly upon the shoulder of the
                  Iroquois.</p>
               <p>She had alarmed the whole village, the night before, by reporting Coaina's
                  disappearance, professing all the time, the greatest grief and uneasiness about
                  her, even while she secretly exulted in the certainty that she had fallen into the
                  snare spread for her by her malicious arts. Now, when she saw Coaina brought to
                  her door dead, as she thought, her pretended grief was changed to genuine alarm,
                  and wringing her hands, she uttered the mournful and peculiar cry called by the
                  Indians <hi rend="i"/>wakonowen, prolonging its shrill cadences until the whole
                  air echoed with its sad notes, and one after another, within range of its sound,
                  hurried hither, until quite a crowd had collected in and around the lodge.</p>
               <p>"She is not dead," said Ahdeek, laying his light burden down upon a pile of skins
                  and furs hastily thrown together by Winonah and some of the women. "She is not
                  dead," he continued, as Altontinon paused in her lamentations to take breath,
                  while every ear was strained to catch all that he had to say, "but the <hi
                     rend="i"/>Taho was too much for her."</p>
               <p>"The <hi rend="i"/>Taho!" screamed a woman, drawing her two little girls close to
                  her. "Was Coaina—the child of our Blessed Mother—the Rose of our tribe
                     <emph>there!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Esa! esa! and she the head of the Confraternity of the Rosary!" exclaimed
                  another.</p>
               <p>"And to think <emph>we</emph> were always taught to try and be like
                     <emph>her,</emph>" added a young girl.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> almost felt afraid to touch the hem of her garment!" said
                  Winonah.</p>
               <p>"Oh, the detestable hypocrite!" said an old squaw, wagging her head.</p>
               <p>"To think how we all loved her!" said a young girl, sadly.</p>
               <p>"Think of her deceiving Father Etienne and our young chief! It is good she was
                  caught in time!" said a grave looking woman, who had not yet spoken.</p>
               <p>Old Ma-kee now edged his way feebly through the crowd, and stood looking down on
                  the still, piteous face of Coaina. The muscles in his old withered cheeks worked,
                  and a wonderfully tender and sorrowful look came over the usual fierce expression
                  of his eyes. He stooped down and smoothed her small dusky hand, and laid his own
                  shrunken, tawny hand lightly upon her forehead. Then he stood up and said: "<hi
                     rend="i"/>To-hic has done no evil. I<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6299-00000052"/>
                  saw a white kid stung to death by a moccasin:<emph>I</emph> killed the snake. I
                  was young then; now I am old, but my arm is not too withered to strike down the
                  snake that stung To-hic. Where is the Iroquois?" There was a fierce, deathly gleam
                  in the old pagan's eye as he looked around the circle of dusky faces, who were
                  watching him; they moved back, for as he moved his arm it lifted his blanket, and
                  they saw that he wore a long, bright knife in his girdle, and a hatchet, keenly
                  sharpened. But Ahdeek had long since slipped away, and was heard of, weeks
                  afterwards, hunting in the forests of Maine. A grim look of contempt stole over
                  Ma-kee's features, then he turned to Altontinon and said: "The snows of nearly
                  eighty winters have brought me wisdom. I see what I see and know what I know. I
                  found a young pigeon once in the forest, with its wing broken. I put it into a
                  nest of young crows, and watched. The old mother crow came home and tore the
                  pigeon to pieces to feed her own young." Then he marched off, well satisfied that
                  he had struck no chance blow at Altontinon.</p>
               <p>"It's no wonder old Ma-kee likes her," said Winonah, "since she goes to the Taho,
                  and is a pagan like himself. But see! Coaina opens her eyes!" she cried, gazing
                  down with gratified malice on the mournful and beautiful face of her cousin.</p>
               <p>"Go for Father Etienne, Winonah. Friends, stand back, and give the unfortunate one
                  air and water. She must not perish in her wickedness. Oh, to think, after all my
                  care—oh! oh! oh!"—cried Altontinon, quite overcome, or rather pretending to be
                  so.</p>
               <p>Every one Winonah met on her way to Father Etienne's, she told the news that
                  Coaina had "spent the night in the medicine lodge of the Iroquois, and assisted at
                  their superstitious rites. She went with Ahdeek, and everybody knew Ahdeek; yes,
                  she was at the Taho, and everybody knew what <emph>that</emph> was."</p>
               <p>"So," thought some, "we have been deceived." But most of those who heard the
                  strange and dreadful news were shocked and bewildered. If that bright and glorious
                  star, worshipped with divine honors by their fathers in the primitive days, and
                  still regarded by the Indians as the most splendidly beauteous of all that spangle
                  the blue robes of heaven, had fallen a black and shapeless mass at their feet,
                  they could not have been more amazed than at the fall of Coaina, in whom they had
                  never seen speck or flaw, and who was, after the Blessed<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000053"/> Virgin, the purest model of womanly and christian
                  virtues they knew on earth. So blithe, so modest, so amiable towards all; "who,"
                  they wondered, "could ever feel envy or bitterness for Coaina? What enemies had
                  she to plan such slanders? none. Then, alas! it must be true!" Alack-a-day! the
                  evil days had indeed come for the young Algonquin maid, since even her best and
                  dearest friends and kinsmen were deceived. There was none to help her on earth.
                  Only the Great Spirit and His Immaculate Mother knew the innocence of that soul,
                  which was to suffer such keen sorrows, holding it in a divine sanetuary; the
                  powers of earth might crucify her flesh, but never pluck down or wither a single
                  blossom of her crown; for <emph>there</emph> she was eternally safe. But having
                  formed her life on theirs, she must drink, with resignation, of their bitter
                  chalice—be, like Mary, suspected of evil, and, like Jesus, be reviled and cast out
                  by her own people.</p>
               <p>And the good Father Etienne—he was but human! There was no supernatural power to
                  tell him that all this condemnatory, circumstantial evidence against Coaina was
                  utterly false. He was speechless when Tar-ra-hee told him what he had witnessed
                  with his own eyes. It seemed like the culminating proof of all else that had been
                  whis- pered against her. When left alone, the good priest, with a sharp pang at
                  heart, entered the sanctuary to mourn, in silence, over the fall of this child of
                  many graces, who had not only given such scandal to religion, and humiliated
                  Christians, but had afforded a new triumph to the heathen and unbelievers, and to
                  pray for guidance in conducting the trial on the morrow. Winonah waited long to
                  see him, and when he, at length, left the chapel, she delivered her errand.
                  Without speaking, he turned and walked quietly to Altontinon's lodge, which was,
                  by this time, crowded with the friends and kinsmen of Altontinon and Tar-ra-hee,
                  sitting or standing, in grave and boding silence around the apartment, while in
                  the midst, seated upon a rude bench, was Coaina, silent, pallid and drooping, her
                  long, graceful hands folded together on her knees, while her attire, usually trim
                  and neat, was damp and disarranged, and her long, rich tresses fell carelessly
                  over her shoulders to the earthen floor. There she sat, like Job, accused of a
                  hundred sins of which she was guiltless. There she sat, like her Lord in the hall
                  of Pilate, awaiting the judgment of an extreme penalty for the crimes of others.
                  Way was made for Father Etienne who, to the surprise of all, was followed by
                     Tar-ra-hee,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6299-00000054"/> stern, grave and
                  decorous, his rich blanket falling in graceful folds from his shoulders, and
                  wearing no ornament except a large silver medal of the Blessed Virgin.</p>
               <p>Coaina looked up when she saw the skirt of Father Etienne's <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">soutane,</foreign> with a gleam of hope in her eyes; but when
                  she saw his stern countenance and averted eyes, and just behind him the grave and
                  clouded face of Tar-ra-hee, over which gleamed not a single ray of pity, a vivid
                  crimson dyed her face, neck and hands; her eyelids, heavy with their long, dusky
                  lashes, drooped upon her cheeks, and her lips, now suddenly grown pallid, quivered
                  with agony.</p>
               <p>"Coaina," said Father Etienne, "stand up and speak the truth when I question you.
                  For the sake of your own soul and religion, I adjure you, in the sacred names of
                  Jesus and Mary, to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth."</p>
               <p>"I will, my father," she answered, in a low, distinct tone, as she arose.</p>
               <p>"Where did you spend the night?"</p>
               <p>"In the medicine lodge of the Iroquois."</p>
               <p>"What did you see there?"</p>
               <p>"I saw the Taho."</p>
               <p>"Were you taken to the medicine lodge by violence?"</p>
               <p>"No, my father," she said, looking up with a bewildered expression.</p>
               <p>"Who did you see there you knew?"</p>
               <p>"Only Ahdeek, my father."</p>
               <p>"Why did you go there, Coaina?"</p>
               <p>"I got a letter from you telling me to come."</p>
               <p>Here every dusky face leaned forward, and Father Etienne knitted his brows, while
                  his face exhibited the strongest emotion.</p>
               <p>"That is false, unfortunate child! It is also a slander," he said sternly. "Where
                  is that letter?"</p>
               <p>"I have it not, my father. Ahdeek tore it up."</p>
               <p>"What did it say?" asked Father Etienne.</p>
               <p>"It said, 'two girls of the Iroquois are dying, and will not be baptized until you
                  come. Come quickly to the lodge beyond the pines outside the Iroquois village.
                  That is what I remember. Your name, my father, was to it. I thought I obeyed you.
                  After I got there I saw that I was entrapped, but I could not escape."</p>
               <p>"That is a well got up story, Coaina; shame upon you!" said Altontinon, stepping
                  forward. "No letter came to her, my father. Winonah says that none came. Winonah
                  was sick, and I left Coaina to nurse her; but she left her and went away without
                  saying where. It is like the mantle Ah-<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6299-00000055"/>
                  deek gave her. Ahdeek has been Coaina's lover since she was a child."</p>
               <p>"Did Ahdeek give you that mantle, Coaina?" asked Father Etienne.</p>
               <p>"I was told that—that—Tar-ra-hee had left it for me," she replied, gently.</p>
               <p>"Oh, the bold one!" exclaimed her aunt. "I told her before Winonah that Ahdeek had
                  brought her the mantle—she knows I did. And now I must speak. Coaina is not
                  honest. She is not true. She steals my money, and sends it to Montreal to buy
                  finery. She has told me many lies. My life has been worn out with her, and trying
                  to hide her faults. Her ingratitude and hypocrisy I could bear, but I dared not
                  let her carry dishonor into the lodge of Tar-ra-hee."</p>
               <p>"There are calumnies," says a modern writer, "so great as to confuse innocence
                  itself." Thus it was with poor Coaina. She saw that the evidence against her was
                  strong, without being true. Events had encompassed her like a net, and confirmed
                  all the slanders of her enemies. Everything made her appear more guilty; there was
                  no witness to disprove the charges, and benumbed in her still anguish, she said
                  not a word, but, "like a sheep before her shearers, she was dumb."</p>
               <p>"Miserable child," said Father Etienne, breaking the breathless silence, while
                  tears rolled unbidden over his aged cheeks. "There is nothing left for you but
                  penance for your vices and crimes. You have brought great scandal on religion, you
                  have wounded charity, you have been guilty of base ingratitude, you have outraged
                  decency, and, to crown your sins, you have renewed the bitter Passion of Jesus
                  Christ, and pierced with a sword of grief the heart of His tender Mother. I cannot
                  pronounce your sentence until the assembly investigate your case and consult upon
                  it. I came here hoping to find you innocent; I go away believing you guilty. Go to
                  your room, and remain there until your people decide upon your punishment, and may
                  Almighty God bring you to repentance."</p>
               <p>Coaina arose, folded her hands upon her bosom, and bowed in token of obedience,
                  then walked tremblingly away to the curtained corner of the lodge called hers.
                  Lifting the curtain, she disappeared from the eyes of her traducers and enemies,
                  and falling prostrate upon the floor, her soul sent up its strong appeal unto Him
                  who alone knew her innocence; to Him who would never turn away from her, and on
                  whose strong arm she could lean on this her day of tribulation; to Him in<pb
                     n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6299-00000056"/> whom she would trust, even though He
                  might slay her. But the passion of her grief was bitter. She was only human, and
                  this casting of her out, this rending of the ties which had so long bound her to
                  her friends, her director, her kinsmen, was terrible to bear, and gave separate
                  and fierce wounds to her natural life, as each one was parted asunder. The cross
                  was heavy to-day, but on the morrow it would become almost insupportable, while
                  the clouds hanging gloomily above her would gather more darkly around her way.</p>

               <head type="sub">COAINA'S SENTENCE.</head>
               <p>TO DESCRIBE the judicial proceedings of the assembly in Coaina's case would
                  stretch my narrative to a wearisome length; therefore, I will simply relate that,
                  after due deliberation and a careful examination of the <emph>apparent
                     facts</emph> of the case, those facts which, according to the judgement of all
                  concerned, were incontestibly proved by credible witnesses, a verdict was
                  rendered, and sentence pronounced on the beautiful and innocent Rose of the
                  Algonquins. Here I will quote from Monsigneur De C——'s statement.</p>
               <p>Coaina was sentenced:</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>First. To live alone in a hut adjoining her aunt's lodge.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Second. To perform such servile offices for her as might be
                  needed.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Third. To seek and encourage no intercourse with the young people
                  of the mission.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Fourth. To wear the garb of a public penitent.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Fifth. To have her hair cut close, and wear a coarse veil.</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sixth (and the most terrible of all to her). She was to be deprived
                  of the sacraments, and was forbidden to enter the chapel, but was to kneel in her
                  penitential dress at the door, during the celebration of all the sacred rites,
                  offices and ceremonies of the Church, with the title of <emph>hypocrite</emph>
                  printed in large letters and suspended upon her breast."</p>
               <p>On the same day she was invested in her robes of humiliation. Crowned with
                  ignominy, she knelt at the door of that chapel of which she was the angel,
                  receiving, instead of homage, the cold sneers, the cruel whispers, the open
                  condemnation, the mockery and scorn of all who passed her by.</p>
               <p>Let us pause here an instant, to discriminate<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000057"/> between the malice and hypocrisy of Coaina's
                  enemies who <emph>knew</emph> her innocence, and the mistaken conviction of those
                  of her former friends who believed her guilty. For the first there is no excuse;
                  they deliberately and maliciously planned the desolation and ruin of that young
                  life; they made it appear that a great and public scandal had been committed, and
                  so perjured themselves as to deceive not only the good Father Etienne, but also
                  the sincere Christians of his flock, who thought her punishment, when measured by
                  her apparent guilt, was not too heavy. The ill opinion of the wicked is without a
                  sting; but when the good, the charitable and just, deceived by false reports, or
                  otherwise, array themselves against one, then indeed an indescribale bitterness is
                  added to the cup of woe, and the soul cries out, in the darkness and desolation of
                  its abandonment: "My God! why hast Thou forsaken me?" All of Coaina's former
                  friends and admirers could now only regard her as a hypocrite, who had long and
                  speciously deceived them; so, full of horror at the reflection of her sacrilegious
                  life, they shrunk from her as from a pestilence, and publicly resented the
                  dishonor and scandal she had brought upon religion. And yet these were innocent
                  before heaven, through the blindness of human judgement; the originators of the
                  monstrous wrong were alone responsible for <emph>all</emph> the evil and
                     <emph>all</emph> the scandal that had grown out of their selfish pride and
                  malice. Old Ma-kee, who was a heathen, you know, caring neither for God or man,
                  paid no heed to the <emph>interdict,</emph> and had no feeling except that of
                  indignation at the humiliation of the only thing upon earth that he loved, and he
                  resented it by disowning his people, as they had disowned her. It was he who
                  gathered the wild forest flowers and brought them to her hut, or laid them beside
                  her as she knelt at the chapel door; it was he whose harsh old quavering voice
                  fell in accents of kindness upon her ear; he who, more than once, had given such
                  sudden and well-aimed blows at the urchins who taunted and mocked her that they
                  fell stunned and sprawling upon the grass. To Altontinon and Winonah he had become
                  an incubus and terror. They cowered beneath the fierce gleam of the old pagan's
                  eye, and would rather have heard the most deafening thunder that ever sped its
                  bolt into the depths of the forest, than to hear old Ma-kee's bitter whisper of
                  "Snakes! snakes! snakes!" hissed in their ear as they passed by.</p>
               <p>Deeply touched by the old Indian's constant affection, Coaina prayed incessantly
                  for his conver-<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6299-00000058"/> sion, and also for that
                  of her aunt and cousin, as well as of all others who had injured her. In fact,
                  she, who had been cast out as unworthy by her people, was now their pleading
                  angel, who forgot her wrongs in the exercise of a divine charity.</p>
               <p>Father Etienne sorrowed and prayed for the poor penitent, who bore her cross with
                  such sweetness and patience; he had at times a suspicion that she was the innocent
                  victim of a base plot; but the mystery—if there was one—was too deep for him to
                  fathom, and the scandal had been too public to go unpunished. And so the time
                  passed until the next moon, when the Indians departed with their families and
                  household effects, in their birchen canoes, for the distant northwest, where,
                  surrounded by incredible hardships, they hunted the bison and the deer, the otter
                  and the mink, the beaver and the bear, and other smaller game. Coaina accompanied
                  them, still as a public penitent, and the servant of her aunt, the change bringing
                  naught to her except greater hardships, which she bore without murmuring.</p>
               <p>And so three years passed by. The mystery was still unsolved, and Coaina still
                  wore her penitential garb, was still interdicted an approach to the sacraments,
                  was still a by-word and reproach among her people. The only event of any
                  importance in prospect, was the reported marriage of Tar-ra-hee and Winonah, for
                  which it was said, preparations were being made. Ahdeek never reappeared among his
                  people. It was rumored that in crossing the St. Lawrence in his canoe, it had been
                  drawn into the whirl of the rapids, and dashed over the great falls into the
                  foaming abyss below. An Indian certainly perished there about that time, within
                  sight of thousands of spectators, and as he never returned or was heard of again,
                  the inference was accepted that the unfortunate wretch was Ahdeek.</p>
               <p>Again came the month of the falling leaves, and once more the mission was in a
                  grand commotion, preparing for the annual migration to the distant hunting
                  grounds, two thousand miles off. Father Etienne, as usual, was to accompany them.
                  Another priest, a young and saintly missionary, who had fled from the endearments
                  of noble kindred and home in his dear land of France; who had turned his back upon
                  honors and all the charms of civilization, to labor among the heathen tribes of
                  the far west—asked and gained permission to join com-<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000059"/> pany with them, an incident which was a great
                  solace to Father Etienne, who was growing old. (Monsigneur De C.)</p>
               <p>On a certain day they all embarked in their frail canoes, to start on their
                  perilous voyage to the western plains. At certain places, to avoid the sweeping
                  rapids, the terrific rocks and falls, they leave the river, carrying their canoes
                  and baggage past the dangerous spots, when they again launch their frail vessels,
                  and embark.</p>
               <p>Bearing the same hardships and dangers as themselves, Father Etienne cheered and
                  encouraged them as much by his counsel as his example, performing the offices of
                  priest and comforter with tireless zeal, sometimes celebrating the holy mysteries
                  on the bosom of some broad, calm river, with the picturesque fleet drawn up in
                  perfect order around the floating altar, the paddles at rest, and gay pennons
                  flying, while every dusky face and form in the gentle rocking canoes was bent with
                  reverent and adoring attention towards the "canoe of prayer and sacrifice." These
                  were occasions of deep and unutterable joy to our poor penitent, who, sometimes
                  near, and sometimes farther off, in her aunt's canoe, witnessed the sacred
                  mystery. Sometimes Mass was celebrated under the flame-colored branches of the
                  primeval forest; sometimes on the mountain side; sometimes upon a desolate shore.
                  But it was the great refreshment and consolation of this weary nomadic people,
                  when and wherever celebrated. The place was nothing to them—the sacrament
                  everything.</p>
               <p>One sad incident occurred. The canoe in which the young French missionary, with
                  four Abnaki Indians, were making the voyage, one day got far ahead of the mission
                  flotilla, which proceeded slowly, on account of the dangerous rapids, whose
                  current was powerfully felt long before they were seen; nor could all the signals
                  which were made for them to return induce them to do so—probably they were
                  misunderstood as cheering signals for them to proceed in the race they had won so
                  far in advance. Suddenly the canoe was drawn into the mighty current, and whirled
                  like a dead leaf amongst the foaming, shrieking waters; now lost to sight amid
                  cataracts of spray, now tossed like a feather on the gale, high upon the surface,
                  with five human beings clinging hopelessly to its sides, Then, in the twinkling of
                  an eye, it was engulphed forever; the young missionary received the reward of
                  eternal life for the mortal life he had so generously and nobly given to God's
                  service.</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6299-00000060"/>
               <p>At length, having arrived at the place best suited for their purposes, and most
                  convenient for hunting, the Indians disembarked, and each family selecting a site,
                  erected a wigwam of boughs, which they covered with skins sewed together. In a
                  short time the business of the winter begins; the men, and women also, hunt and
                  fish continually, living upon the animals they kill; dressing the skins, and
                  preserving with great care the costly furs, which they sell readily in Montreal
                  for high prices, and to traders from the United States. In this hunting expedition
                  no one was more expert or successful than Coaina in securing much costly game. Her
                  aim was unerring, and when she drew the string of her bow her arrow sped like
                  lightning into a vital part of the animal, without tearing the fur. Swans, wild
                  turkeys, an eagle, and small game of every kind, loaded her aunt's wigwam, who,
                  with Winonah, prepared the peltry for the markets, sheltered from cold, and
                  enduring no real hardships. But still they found no kind word for the patient
                  Coaina. Injurious epithets, blows, scanty fare, and hardships of every kind were
                  her reward. What incited them to greater malignity, was the fact that Tar-ra-hee
                  had left his people, at the mouth of the Sauganay, to spend the winter with some
                  of his braves on its bleak shores, to hunt the white bear, the seal and the
                  beaver, and for this disappointment they wreaked their spite on Coaina, whose
                  heart, sore, and almost breaking under the torture of her undeserved ill-usage,
                  clung tremblingly and closer to Jesus and Mary, fearful that after all she should
                  lose patience and forfeit her only good. But nothing touched the hearts of these
                  evil-minded, obdurate women; her very patience and defencelessness, so far from
                  appealing to their generosity and forbearance, seemed to excite them to greater
                  cruelty and malice. No one observed it, but Coaina's cheek had lost its beautiful
                  roundness of outline; her step, still swift and agile, was often checked by
                  shortness of breath, and wild, painful heart-throbs. The rich blood no longer
                  glowed in transparent suffusion through her amber-colored skin, and delicately
                  chiseled lips; there was a spot of crimson upon each thin cheek, like the first
                  reddening flame which consumes the life of the maple leaf in autumn. Her eyes—now
                  seldom lifted—sparkled with a strange glow beneath her heavy eye-lids, and when
                  suddenly raised by some one speaking to her, or in surprise at some distant sound,
                  they looked like those of a hunted gazelle. Outcast and despised, her
                     communings<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6299-00000061"/> had long ceased to be of
                  this life, or of its small affairs. The world had thrown her off as more worthless
                  than the refuse of a dung-hill; but could the veil have been, but one moment,
                  withdrawn, could mortal eyes have, but for one instant, beheld the "glorious ones
                  in shining raiment" who surrounded her, who enfolded her within the embraces of
                  their stainless wings, guarding her soul's integrity as a precious and priceless
                  jewel, they would have fallen upon their faces before her, invoking her
                  forgiveness and prayers.</p>
               <p>But neither to her or them was such sight vouchsafed. The designs of God must
                  ripen according to His wisdom, and for Coaina the consummation was near at
                  hand.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE TWO SHADOWS.</head>
               <p>THE season of leaves and flowers had again rolled round; the bluebird whistled in
                  the air, and the bobolink sounded his low bugle as he raided with his brown
                  troopers through the feathery ferns. Everything wore a gay and prosperous look in
                  the village of the lake. The hunting season had been extremely successful, not
                  only in the quantity of game secured, but in the quality and abundance of rare
                  furs, skins, and other valuable peltries they were enabled to bring home. Better
                  still, the price of peltries had gone up considerably higher than was ever known
                  before, owing to an increased demand from the United States and England, which was
                  really in excess of the supply; hence our Indians of the mission found themselves
                  richer than they had ever been before. On Sundays and holidays the church looked
                  like a tropical <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parterre,</foreign> with the array of
                  rich, bright colors in the attire of the women, whose new variegated
                     handkerchiefs,<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6299-00000062"/> blue scarfs, scarlet
                  petticoats, spangled jackets and fringed tunics, were in harmonious keeping with
                  the magnificent hunting shirts—decorated with beads and fringes—of the men, who
                  displayed new scarlet leggings, wrought curiously with porcupine quills, and
                  moccasins flaming with scarlet, with glittering beads and tinsel. Altontinon and
                  Winonah held their heads higher than ever, while the extreme gaudiness of their
                  apparel, extravagant both in texture and style, attracted every eye. While the
                  other women and young girls observed a fitting degree of moderation and modesty in
                  their attire, these two flaunted about arrayed in the gaudiest colors, the
                  flashiest trinkets, the heaviest coils of beads, and the most exaggerated style of
                  garments that the wildest Indian fancy could suggest, or the markets of Montreal
                  supply.</p>
               <p>A great improvement was also evident in the increased comforts of their rude
                  lodges, in the richer adornment of their beloved chapel, and the quality and
                  quantity of their agricultural implements; indeed, the village of the "Lake of the
                  Two Mountains" seemed like the centre of a happy pastoral Arcadia, into which no
                  grief could enter.</p>
               <p>In the midst of all this gay prosperity and cheerful plenty, there was ever moving
                  to and fro, or kneeling with bowed head at the chapel door, a silent, shadowy
                  form, clothed in coarse, penitential garments of grey. This shadowy, veiled figure
                  was never noticed, except to be jostled aside and scoffed at as it glided through
                  the mission grounds. And it moved like one walking in a dream. If she was jostled
                  rudely, or called out to roughly, or had her veil or garments plucked at by the
                  village urchins, she would suddenly lift her great soft eyes, and with a bright,
                  wild glance around, as if she had been startled from solemn reverie, deep within
                  her inner life, smile sorrowfully, look down again, and move on.</p>
               <p>There was this shadow, which the Algonquins saw daily; a shadow for whose presence
                  they had only contempt, or a silent indifference—the shadow of a crushed life, the
                  summing up of all that slander could do.</p>
               <p>But there was another shadow coming towards them, slowly and inevitably, the very
                  thought of which made the bravest heart among them quail. This shadow had already
                  reached Montreal, and they even now felt the vibrations of its noiseless but
                  mighty tread, already felt the cold thrill of its viewless form. They could not
                  keep it away; neither barriers nor all the engineering that science<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000063"/> has ever taught—neither the bravery of warriors,
                  the exorcism of priests, nor the tears and prayers of a people, could stay its
                  course, because it was the stern messenger of the Most High, whose mission it was
                  to chasten, to punish and remind the world of the judgment to come. It was the
                     <emph>cholera!</emph> and as it strode towards them, while every face wore an
                  anxious, a sad or thoughtful expression, the face of the other shadow which was
                  clothed in the robes of penance grew more serene and bright, as if that which
                  brought such terror to all, only came a messenger of hope to her. And so it was.
                  "If it were only the Great Spirit's sweet will," she thought, "it will bring one
                  deliverance and rest; but His will, not mine, be done!"</p>
               <p>One day—it was a bright and glorious morning, just such a one as that on which the
                  malignant plans laid for Coaina's ruin seemed crowned with success—there suddenly
                  arose from Altontinon's lodge, shrill, piercing cries of pain, blended with the
                  mournful <hi rend="i"/>wakonowin. The shadow had come! it had entered Altontinon's
                  lodge, and stricken her down even while she exulted in her health, her wickedness
                  and her prosperity. Messengers ran here and there for assistance. Father Etienne
                  was soon beside her writhing, tortured form, but her kinsmen and people stood
                  aloof, cowering outside the lodge, their hearts quailing within them as her
                  shrieks of agony rent the air. While she wrestled for life with this awful shadow,
                  the shadow in the garments of penance ministered to her needs. It was Coaina
                  (obeying the directions of Father Etienne) who applied the hot poultices, who
                  administered the fiery draughts which were thought efficacious, and which
                     <emph>were</emph> marvellously so in ordinary cases; it was she who performed
                  the most repulsive offices for the agonized woman, who wept over her, who clung to
                  her cramped hands, who kissed her cold feet, and prayed without ceasing for her.
                  None else would come near or touch her. Winonah, trembling and pallid, crouched in
                  a distant corner, her head bowed upon her knees, incapable of performing the
                  slightest duty. Suddenly Altontinon cried out: "I wronged her! I ruined her! She
                  is innocent of all! Coaina, forgive me! forgive me! You are an angel! I am a
                  devil! O, pray for me to the Holy Mother! Do not let me be cast into hell! O, save
                  me from the flames! Hold me fast, Coaina! O, Christ, forgive me! Coaina,
                     <emph>forgive</emph> me!"</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6299-00000064"/>
               <p>"I forgive thee, my aunt, as I hope Christ will forgive me," she answered, kissing
                  the blue, trembling lips of the dying sinner.</p>
               <p>"Father Etienne, hear me! hear me! I will confess—" but here ensued such a mortal
                  struggle that she was unable to continue. Her head was drawn round, her features,
                  pinched and blue, were distorted with agony, and her arms and legs, drawn away,
                  were knotted in muscular distortions fearful to behold. Father Etienne, startled
                  by her confession of guilt, feared that the last agony was upon her, and knelt to
                  pray for her departing soul. Coaina, also praying, bathed her feet with her tears.
                  But the paroxysm subsided, and an interval of comparative ease ensued—of ease
                  which was but the forerunner of that rest from suffering which the tortured body
                  would soon enjoy.</p>
               <p>"Call my child—call my kindred around me, "said Altontinon, in feeble tones.
                  "Quick, tell them to come. I have many words to say before them."</p>
               <p>Father Etienne said: "Your confession first; your confession; then, what time you
                  have left, say all that you wish."</p>
               <p>"It is my confession. I must confess in public the evil I did in secret. O, my
                  father, call them quickly, or I die!" plead Altontinon.</p>
               <p>Father Etienne did as she desired, but it was only by the most urgent entreaties
                  that he could get Winonah and the rest to approach the dying woman, whose shrunken
                  features and pallid skin, which already hung loose and wrinkled from her bones,
                  were dripping with the cold dews of dissolution, while the blue, ghastly shadow
                  threw its cadaverous hue over it all. The group of her kinsmen and friends who
                  entered stood some distance off, looking with dread at her changed appearance.</p>
               <p>"Now," she said, "listen to my words, for this is my last confession. I ruined
                     <emph>her</emph> by my malice," she continued, pointing her shrunken and almost
                  powerless hand to Coaina; "because I wanted my own child to be the wife of
                  Tar-ra-hee. I held counsel with Ahdeek, the Iroquois, who brought the robe, and I
                  made up the story that Tar-ra-hee had left it for Coaina, and wished her to wear
                  it to meet him on the shore. <emph>I</emph> wrote the letter that beguiled her to
                  the medicine lodge! I set Tar-ra-hee to watch her! I arranged the whole plot to
                  expose her! I persuaded my kinsmen to circulate evil reports about her! I made my
                  own child lie, and make oath to her lie, that Coaina was a thief! <emph>I did
                     it!</emph> Coaina is guiltless! No bap-<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000065"/> tized babe could be purer! O, Coaina! can you
                  forgive me!"</p>
               <p>"My child," said Father Etienne, tears flowing over his cheeks, as he approached
                  and knelt before Coaina, "my child, can you forgive us all?"</p>
               <p>"O, my father!" cried Coaina, covered with confusion, as she knelt, and lifting
                  the hem of his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soutane,</foreign> pressed it to her lips,
                  "this is too much."</p>
               <p>"Say, my child, that you forgive us," said Father Etienne.</p>
               <p>"O, my father! yes, yes! ten thousand, thousand times—but no! what have I to
                  forgive? O, my aunt! if you knew the peace and consolation that sufferings have
                  brought me, you would rejoice, and be glad!" exclaimed Coaina, while her
                  countenance shone with a divine peace. There was no exultation to mar its
                  serenity, or cloud the tender pity of her eyes, now resting upon the face of
                  Altontinon.</p>
               <p>"O, my father, darkness gathers around me," said Altontinon, in a low, solemn
                  voice. "Coaina, do you forgive me?"</p>
               <p>"As I hope Christ to forgive me, so do I forgive you with all my heart and soul,"
                  she replied.</p>
               <p>"Then will <emph>He</emph> forgive me! Oh, my sins! my sins! Father, help me! The
                  shadows grow dark- er—the winds colder," cried Altontinon, shuddering.</p>
               <p>Father Etienne made a sign, and all withdrew from the presence of the fast sinking
                  woman—her guilty accomplices filled with confusion and dread; the others
                  bewildered by the strange revelations and appalling scenes they had witnessed; all
                  withdrew except Coaina, whose hand was held fast in the death grasp of Altontinon.
                  Father Etienne leaned over and heard her low murmuring words of penitence; her
                  voice was almost gone, or she would have declared her sins aloud; in view of her
                  great guilt, and the near approach of the dread judgment, no motive of human
                  respect or shame could have withheld her; her only desire <emph>now</emph> was to
                  relieve her conscience, that she might depart in the humble hope of one day
                  finding safety and peace. Convinced of her true penitence, Father Etienne
                  administered Extreme Unction, and pronounced the last absolution. She was too far
                  gone to receive the supreme and crowning consolation of the Holy Viaticum.</p>
               <p>"Does Coaina forgive me?" she whispered again.</p>
               <p>"Coaina's prayers have obtained your conversion; doubt not, then, her forgiveness
                  in this extreme hour," said Father Etienne.</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6299-00000066"/>
               <p>"Have you prayed for me, Coaina? Through it all, Coaina? Can it be? Tell me,
                  child!" she moaned.</p>
               <p>"I have never ceased praying for you, my aunt," she replied, as she stooped down
                  and kissed Altontinon's damp forehead, already marbled by the touch of death.</p>
               <p>Then, for the first time, tears flowed from Altontinon's darkened eyes, and she
                  whispered, almost gasping: "Call upon the holy names that I dare not speak; and
                  while Father Etienne read the office for the dying, Coaina whispered over and over
                  again in her ear the names of JESUS and MARY. She lay so silent and motionless
                  they thought her dead, when she suddenly cried out: "Jesus, forgive," striking her
                  breast with her shriveled hand; and with these words upon her lips, with her hand
                  uplifted to inflict another self-accusing blow, the troubled soul of Altontinon
                  passed away to the tribunal of Infinite Justice, where, we trust—despite her sins
                  and misdeeds—it found safe shelter in the infinite mercy of Him who pardoned the
                  dying thief.</p>
               <p>Ere night settled upon the panic-stricken village, Winonah lay dead beside her
                  mother. Confessing her sins, she humbly asked pardon of Coaina, whom she had so
                  cruelly assisted to injure, and, above all, for the public scandal produced by her
                  malice and falsehoods, and died a few hours after she was stricken by the
                  pestilence, in great agony and deep perturbation of soul.</p>
               <p>Coaina had "missed the crown, but not the stake of martyrdom." The penitent
                  confessions of Altontinon and Winonah, before so many witnesses, removed the
                  stigma from her name and reputation. All were as anxious now to obtain a look or
                  word from her as they were before eager to avoid her.</p>
               <p>By what most people would call a remarkable coincidence, but which Monsigneur De
                  C——, who was deeply versed in the ways of God, styled retributive justice, the
                  first victims of cholera in that Algonquin village were Altontinon, Winonah, and
                  five of their kinsfolk who were leagued with them in the wicked plot against the
                  innocent Coaina, who perished, one after another, publicly confessing his or her
                  agency in the affair, while they made the most solemn asseverations of her perfect
                  innocence.</p>
               <p>Like an angel, Coaina walked unscathed amidst the pestilence; her grey,
                  penitential garments, so lately the insignia of her disgrace, were now honored as
                  no royal robes were ever honored, and<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6299-00000067"/>
                  hailed with blessings afar and near; wherever she appeared, those who had
                  slandered, defamed and made a mock of her, would fain have knelt and kissed the
                  frayed and faded serge, had she allowed it. But such homage could not move her
                  soul from its strong entrenchments upon that rock whither the storms of obloquy
                  and humiliation had driven her, and where, in divine crucibles, the dross of her
                  nature had been separated from the precious gold. With sweet and gentle words she
                  received their repentant expressions of kindness, but hastened away from all who
                  sought to detain her, to minister to the sick and dying. Standing or kneeling
                  beside them, assisting Father Etienne in all that she could, holding the poor
                  hands stiffening in death, or smoothing the cold forehead knotted with agony;
                  reciting the prayers and aspirations which their feeble tongues could no longer
                  utter; performing the most menial offices, shrinking, in fact, from nothing that
                  she could do for the dying or convalescent, she gave herself but scant rest day or
                  night until the dread pestilence, leaving behind its broad furrows of graves,
                  passed away from among them, through the forests, southward.</p>

               <head type="sub">CROWNING.</head>
               <p>IT was with great joy that Coaina once more approached the divine sacraments. Like
                  a pilgrim long abroad, and lost in a dreary wilderness, who suddenly finds himself
                  at home, surrounded by its peaceful and holy endearments, and partaking of its
                  joyful feasts, as one perishing with thirst in an arid desert suddenly beholds a
                  cool fountain gush from the burning sands beside him; so felt she while kneeling
                  at the shrine of our Blessed Lady, or before the altar to receive the Bread of
                  refreshment and eternal life. Every moment, not devoted to the sick and to
                  necessary repose, she spent in the chapel; it was her home, her refuge, her
                  palace; it was to her the vestibule of heaven and the shadow of its everlasting
                  repose, where she sat undisturbed at the feet of JESUS and MARY.</p>
               <p>Old Ma-kee crept here and there after her, watching and waiting patiently her
                  coming and going, seemingly satisfied if he could keep her in<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000068"/> sight, for he seldom spoke. Towards the people of
                  the mission, he preserved the most dignified <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >hauteur,</foreign> only condescending to speak to them when he had an
                  opportunity to say something very bitter; in fact old Ma-kee was a sort of moral
                  nettle, stinging right and left, which helped the rash-minded in their penance,
                  and gave the more humble something to think about. He was only an old pagan, we
                  know, and it was his way to judge of a tree by its fruits; he was one of those
                  witnesses no one thinks about, who will arise in the latter day to testify for or
                  against the fidelity of christians to their opportunities and graces.</p>
               <p>It was Sunday morning, and the mission chapel was crowded with those whom the
                  pestilence had spared. Father Etienne had appointed that day not only as one of
                  solemn thanksgiving, but was determined, with all the beautiful chivalry of his
                  nation, and the still more noble chivalry of christianity, to make use of the
                  opportunity to offer a public <foreign xml:lang="FRA">amende</foreign> to Coaina,
                  whose great humiliations had not only been public, but so entirely unmerited.</p>
               <p>She, all unaware of what was coming, knelt in her old accustomed place, partly
                  sheltered from view by a cluster of cedar posts. After Father Etienne had spoken
                  in the most simple but impres- sive manner, and with touching pathos, of the great
                  mercy of God in having spared them while the pestilence was abroad, and told them
                  how in gratitude they were more than ever bound to love and honor their Heavenly
                  Protectress, of whom they were the special care, and devote themselves to Almighty
                  God and His service by a stricter obedience to the rules of faith, and a closer
                  observance of the requirements of charity; then he proposed that all should unite
                  with him in saying the decade of the five Dolorous Mysteries of the Rosary, for
                  the repose of the souls of those who had recently fallen victims to the scourge of
                  the pestilence. Instantly, every knee was devoutly bent, and every head bowed,
                  while the soul-touching devotion, with its solemn prayers and responses, was
                  performed. Low sobs and fast falling tears attested the deep emotion felt by the
                  congregation, and there is no doubt that the earnest and pathetic appeal to the
                  mercy-seat in behalf of those who could no longer help themselves amidst the
                  sweettorture of flame and exile, fell like refreshing dews upon their patient and
                  suffering souls.</p>
               <p>This over, the good priest then spoke of Coiana, who shrunk out of sight when she
                  heard her name, covered with confusion and humility. He related,<pb n="132-133"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000069"/> in brief and simple language, the great wrongs that
                  had been inflicted upon her, then declared how utterly groundless had been even
                  the slightest suspicion of her; how guiltless she had been of the least crime
                  charged against her; how each one who had slandered and conspired against her, had
                  separately acknowledged their crime, and asserted her innocence with their dying
                  breath; and then, turning toward where she knelt hidden by the cedar pillars and
                  closely veiled, he asked in the name of all present, her forgiveness. Then he
                  spoke to these simple children of the forest of the error of rash judgment, of the
                  damnable sin of slander, of the bitter evils of envy, of the malice of pride, of
                  the blighting effects of uncharitableness, which opens the door of the soul to all
                  of the capital sins; after which he concluded by contrasting with these, the
                  beauty of humility, the virtue of silence, the eternal fruits of penitence, the
                  holiness of patience, the glory of true charity, and the divine virtue of
                  forgiveness. All understood it. Not one there who would not have kissed the hem of
                  Coaina's garment; but what was their astonishment when—as Coiana with bowed head
                  and meekly folded hands, approached the altar and knelt to receive the "food of
                  Angels"—they saw old Ma-kee, who had been crouching somewhere out of sight, creep
                  slowly forward, stand a moment erect and then kneel at Father Etienne's feet
                  beside her, asking for baptism! It was from no want of knowledge, but of faith,
                  that he had deferred and put aside christianity so long—he knew all that it
                  taught; he had been living too long among christians, and was too shrewdly
                  intelligent, and intelligently curious to be ignorant of christian doctrine or
                  dogma, and now by some wonderful operation of Divine Providence—possibly in answer
                  to Coaina's prayers, and to reward his charity toward her during the days of her
                  tribulation—here at the last moment, just when the last sands were crumbling away
                  from his frail foothold on life; the grace of faith was once more proffered him,
                  not to be rejected again. That afternoon at vespers Ma-kee received the
                  regenerating waters of baptism, putting off his old savage cognomen, won more than
                  half a century before by his dexterity in scalping the victims which fell beneath
                  hiswar club in the last fierce wars of his tribe, and received in its stead that
                  of Peter. Ma-kee's conversion made quite a festival at the mission of the Two
                  Mountains, but after it was over, the old chief was seen no more among them. He
                  lay down one night upon his couch of skins, where he lingered<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000070"/> month after month, suffering from an incurable
                  disease. He was removed on a litter to Coaina's lodge, where she nursed him with
                  all the fidelity and tenderness of a daughter. Father Etienne saw him daily and
                  comforted him with good counsel and cheering words. Except to these two he had but
                  few words to say. When his friends, kinsmen and others of his tribe, young and
                  old, flocked to see him, he had but one admonition, which he gave individually to
                  them all, and repeated again whenever they came; this was: "JUDGE NOT." Unlike the
                  beloved disciple at Patmos, he did not say: "Little children love one another;"
                  Ma-kee was of sterner stuff, and had he been in the vigor of his prime, he would
                  have been just as apt as not, had occasion offered, to have <emph>enforced</emph>
                  his admonition by smiting off offenders' ears and otherwise inflicting such just
                  punishment as the case in hand required. But he was too far gone now to do
                  aught—to keep them in mind of the great sin of rash judgment and uncharitableness
                  they had fallen into against his favorite—except say to them, one and all,
                     "<emph>judge not,</emph>" and they remembered the solemn sentence, after the
                  old chief was laid in his Christian grave until the end of their days.</p>
               <p>All was changed for Coaina, but she remained unchanged, except that her soul
                  ripened in virtue and grace. She would fain have continued to wear her grey robes
                  of penance, but Father Etienne represented to her that they were a daily reproach
                  to every one in the village, reminding them of their injustice against her, and
                  expressed his own desire that she should leave them off; then for the sake of
                  charity, and in a spirit of obedience, she did so, and wore a dress and veil of
                  fine cloth, embroidered and faced with white silk, which the ladies of Montreal,
                  who had heard her strange story, had sent to Father Etienne for her
                  acceptance.</p>
               <p>Tar-ra-hee, who had been faithful to her in heart, again sought her for his wife,
                  and other alliances equally as honorable were offered, but she rejected them all
                  with modest and gentle dignity, saying; "I have found my true and constant Lover,
                  He not only comforted and sustained me, when all else failed, and the world
                  abandoned, me; but He also suffered and died for me."</p>
               <p>Ah, happy she to have so early tested the nothingness of this life, and tasted so
                  soon the bitter less of its flower-crowned cup; most happy for her, that the staff
                  upon which she had leaned in thoughtless security, broke in twain, piercing her
                  and driving her to the support of one which would<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000071"/> support her in the "valley of the shadow of death."
                  For Coaina was fading away from this life; her eyes grew brighter, and her cheeks
                  wore that crimson hue, which harbingers dissolution, as the reddening of the
                  forest leaves tells of the death fires which consume their life. Her step, once so
                  swift and light, became feeble and slow; and ere long, she was confined to her
                     lodge.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref> "Changed
                  from penitential silence to a place of pilgrimage, her abode became the resort of
                  people from far and near. As they go to visit the relics and shrines of saints,
                  they came to look upon her; to hear a last word from her lips, to inhale the odor
                  of her virtues, and recommend themselves to her prayers. I saw one, who went in to
                  visit her, come hastily out—the big tears rolling over his face—saying: 'I am
                  unworthy to remain longer in the presence of such an angel.'"</p>

               </note>
               <p>Fading away like the morning star into the brightness of dawn, Coaina—all unmoved
                  except to deeper humility by all the prodigal attentions lavished upon her, and
                  scarcely understanding the interest she excited, so unconscious was she of any
                  superior excellence—felt that her end was drawing near. It was past midnight, and
                  so far from any appearance of approaching dissolution about her, her friends who
                  had been watching beside her, thought they had not seen her look so well and
                  strong for many weeks. There was a look of joy in her face, an elasticity in her
                  motions, and a clear musical ring in her voice which filled them with
                  astonishment, and hope that she was yet to be spared to them. But it was only the
                  girding-up of the pilgrim, who, after his toilsome march, sees through the mist
                  the joyful glimmer upon the walls of the city, where his weary form will find rest
                  and his toils their crown and reward. She was dying, dying in cheerful hope, and
                  calmly made her preparations for the event. She asked for her richest garments,
                  those which she had fashioned with such taste and care nearly four years ago, for
                  her wedding attire, composed of rich stuffs of various and beautiful colors,
                  adorned with brilliant feathers, with pearls and silver and gold fringes; and with
                  the assistance of her friends, arrayed herself in it. Bathing her face and hands,
                  she smoothed back her beautiful hair, now grown long and silky, and placed upon
                  her head the exquisite wreath of feather flowers and pearls, sent to her by the
                  nuns of Notre Dame; she composed herself upon her pillow, her hands folded upon
                  her bosom, holding her beloved<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6299-00000072"/> rosary,
                  which she continued to recite, while she awaited with serene composure the coming
                  of Father Etienne(who had been sent for) with the Holy Viaticum. Soon he came and
                  gave her the holy anointing, all present uniting fervently in the prayers, while
                  they watched through their tears the kindling brightness of her face; after which
                  he approached her, holding in his veiled hands the Most Holy Viaticum, the Bread
                  which consoleth, the Lamb which taketh away all sin. She stretched out her thin
                  dusky hands toward the Divine Guest, and while her eyes glowed with unearthly
                  lustre, she exclaimed in clear, sweet tones: "Welcome, beloved Lord. I bless Thee,
                  my God, that I have been counted worthy to be treated some little like Thy Divine
                  Son; and I bless and forgive, ten thousand times, all who ever injured me. Come,
                  sweet Jesus, it is now that my wedding feasts are about to begin, never to
                  end!"</p>
               <p>These were the last words uttered by Coaina, for after having received the Holy
                  Viaticum, and last absolution, she lay with folded hands, her large bright eyes
                  fixed upon the crucifix and the image of Mary at the foot of her bed, speechless
                  and motionless, and they thought, as they gazed upon her with tender awe, that she
                  held communication with angels, all unseen by them. Beautiful—by the flickering
                  light of tapers, which glistened with fitful rays among the gold and silver
                  trimmings of her bridal dress, flashing out here and there, as with hidden
                  glories—looked the Indian maiden; but more fair and lovely looked she, when the
                  first golden sunbeams stole through the vines, and lighted up those soft tender
                  eyes, now gazing upon far greater and more distant glories—for she was dead. No
                  one knew the moment of her passing away, it was so serene. Her tender and faithful
                  devotion to the Immaculate Mother of Jesus, her patient virtues so like unto hers,
                  crowned this supreme hour with peace, and obtained for her, we trust, swift
                  admission to the ineffable joys of her Divine Son.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that the remembrance of the gentle Coaina's devotion to the Blessed
                  Mother—under whose invocation the Mission was established over a century
                  before—combined with a knowledge of the fruits thereof, which they had all
                  witnessed, not only in the conversion of her enemies, but the increased ardor of
                  the people of the Mission, added but another link to the glittering chain of
                  evidence which stretches from the humble house of Nazareth, through the hoary
                  centuries, down to our own<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6299-00000073"/> times, of
                  the efficacy of the powerful intercession of the Virgin Mother, whose Immaculate
                  Conception cannot be doubted without doubting God; for if He, by His Divine power,
                  created Eve, who was to become the mother of men, pure and spotless, who will dare
                  doubt that by the same Divine power, suspending the common laws of fallen nature,
                  He created pure and without blemish, her, who from all eternity was predestined to
                  the wonderful dignity of becoming the Mother of His Divine Son. Of her flesh was
                  formed His; who then can believe that that virginal flesh had taint or stain of
                  the pollution of the fall? Let us hail thee, then, our Immaculate Mother and
                  tender friend, given to us by Almighty God from His high throne in heaven;

                  compassionate intercessor with thy Son, who is to be our Judge, imploring thee,
                  who partook of all the bitterness of the cup He drained for our salvation, and who
                  knowest so well our human infirmities, to obtain for us such graces that these
                  august sufferings and infinite ransom may not, through our own fault, become
                  useless to us.</p>
               <p>We have concluded the narrative of Coaina, the Rose of the Algonquins, and will
                  close by once more quoting from Monseigneur De C——: "Her burial was more like a
                  triumph than a scene of mourning, and to this day she is honored and invoked by
                  the christians of the mission of the 'Lake of the Two Mountains,' as virgin, and
                  martyr to false testimony.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>[The following is the autograph to which we have alluded in the commencement of
                  COAINA. It was written by Monsigneur de Charbonnel, Bishop of Toronto, C. W., when
                  he was studying the English language at Saint Mary's Seminary, Baltimore.
                  Subsequently, having received permission from the Holy Father, he resigned the
                  mitre, and retired to a cloister of one of the contemplative Orders in
                  Europe:]</p>
               <p>We have near Montreal a Catholic congregation of Indian savages. Their village is
                  situated on the banks of a beautiful lake formed by the waters of the Ottawa, and
                  crowned with two very pleasant little mountains. Hence this village is called the
                  Lake of the Two Mountains.</p>
               <p>There was in this village a young Indian girl, still living last year; I will call
                  her Coaina (Catherine). She was an orphan, educated by her aunt.<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC6299-00000074"/> Almighty God, the special Father of orphans,
                  granted this girl so many graces, and she was so faithful to His inspirations,
                  that, so striking was her piety, docility, modesty and amiability, she possessed
                  the esteem and affection of all the village. She made the family of her aunt
                  happy, and parents proposed her to their children as a model to imitate. From her
                  first years, like those of her tribe, she was employed in hunting.</p>
               <p>Every autumn they leave their village, and start with all their little children to
                  the northwest. Every family embarks in its small and very light canoe, and with
                  this frail vessel goes up the river and lakes two thousand miles distant. In
                  certain places they leave the river, on account of the dreadful rapids through the
                  rocks and falls, and carry their canoes and baggage around. Their happiness is to
                  have with them a missionary, to follow them during all their hunting. It is not
                  two years since that one priest was drowned, with all those who were in the same
                  canoe. Glorious and happy death for a priest devoted to the glory of God and good
                  of souls! Arrived at the woods, in places excellent for hunting, every family
                  erects a hut with trees and branches to pass the winter. All their occupation
                  during that season is to hunt; they live on the animals which they kill or catch,
                  and at their return they sell the skins of these animals, whose furs are so well
                  appreciated in our cities as a defence against the sharpness of the winter. You
                  may judge how hard must be such a life through rivers and lakes and woods, rain
                  and snow, frost and ice, particularly for the tender children.</p>
               <p>However, our young girl, in this manner of living, became as strong, as skilful a
                  huntress, as she was pious and amiable. No one surpassed her in running, in
                  jumping, in climbing up the trees, in shooting; but she surpassed all the others
                  in piety and modesty. Accomplished as Coaina was, the son of the chief of the
                  tribe wished to marry her, and the marriage was to be soon celebrated with great
                  feasts through the village, when all was stopped and changed. Her aunt charged her
                  with many crimes; the judges of the tribe held their solemn assembly to decide the
                  case; witnesses were heard, and on their depositions the accused girl was
                  convicted of several crimes, and condemned to a public penance, and as much
                  despised as she was before esteemed and praised by everybody. For several years
                  the coming in the church and the receiving of the holy Communion were for-<pb
                     n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6299-00000075"/> bidden to her; during the offices, when
                  people were coming in or going out, she was obliged to kneel down or stand outside
                  of the door of the temple, with a dress of penance, and the title of a
                  hypocrite.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the cholera broke out; all the relatives of Coaina were seized, and her
                  aunt the first, and more severely than the others. In fear of death, judgment and
                  hell, she called the priest and the judges, and declared that all the accusations
                  against her neice were but lies, false testimony, calumnies inspired by the devil
                  of jealousy, because her neice had been preferred to her own daughter by the son
                  of the chief of the tribe; all the other accusers confessed the same before they
                  died. Hence, our innocent victim was not now esteemed, as before her condemnation,
                  like a saint, but an angel. The most advantageous alliances were proposed to her,
                  but she refused them all, to belong more closely to God alone.</p>
               <p>The year before last, Coaina was taken sick; during her sickness her cottage was
                  changed into a place of pilgrimage—every one came to her, as people go to the
                  relics of the saints, wishing to see her again, to hear a last word from her
                  mouth, to inhale the odor of her virtues, to recommend them- selves to her
                  prayers; and one day a public sinner being invited to visit the holy sick—I, said
                  he, shedding some big tears, I, to approach such an angel! I am unworthy of
                  it.</p>
               <p>Coaina, feeling death very near, asked for her full dress, composed of stuffs of
                  various and brilliant colors, adorned with feathers, pearls, silver and gold
                  fringes, received the sacraments with the most edifying fervor, blessing God for
                  having been treated a little as her innocent Saviour, and forgiving a thousand
                  times her calumniators. Her confessor, who would not speak when she was condemned,
                  said now that her aunt and relations were indebted for their conversion to the
                  fervent prayers which she did not cease to say in their behalf during her penance.
                  What a heroical charity!</p>
               <p>Her last words were these: It is now that my wedding feasts are going to begin,
                  not to end. Her burial was rather a triumph than a mourning. Everybody in the
                  village honors and invokes her as a virgin, and a martyr of false testimonies.</p>
               <p>God tries sometimes, but never gives up the just; and He always rewards them, here
                  and in heaven, according to their generosity in trials and crosses. Pray for your
                  servant in Christ,</p>

                     pontiffs, just as the events of a kingdom are frequently related in the order
                     of reigns, is a very happy innovation. Your work is in every respect truly
                     admirable. We see in it, distinctly portrayed, the Fathers of the Church and
                     their writings, the martyrs and their sufferings, the heretics and their
                     numerous errors. The Holy Scriptures, the canon law, and the whole discipline
                     of the Church, are alike admirably expounded.</p>
                  <p>I do not hesitate to say to you, if the other three volumes are equal to the
                     first, that your General History of the Church will become a class-book of the
                     highest usefulness in our seminaries.</p>

                  <p>I received your first two volumes in Rome, and after having examined them in my
                     own way, I submitted them to the examination of two eminent men of learning
                     here, Monseigneur Tizzani, Professor in the Roman University, and the
                     celebrated Jesuit Father, rev. P. Ballerini, Professor in the Roman College, no
                     less renowned in the Holy City for his profound erudition.</p>
                  <p>I have the satisfaction of making known to you the fact that these rigid

                     last two volumes are equal to the first (and of this I have no doubt), I shall
                     not hesitate to request the superiors of my seminaries to adopt it in their
                     institutions as the text-book of Ecclesiastical History; and I shall
                     congratulate myself on having been one of the first to profit by the fruit of
                     your labors. Meanwhile, may your enterprise prove a complete success, and may
                     God bless a pen so usefully employed in the service of our Holy Mother the

                  <p>For a long time pat the friends of the Holy See and of the Church were anxious
                     to see a good Ecclesiastical History, short yet complete, interesting in style,
                     truly Catholic, yet moderate and impartial, and fit to be used both by the
                     clergy and the liaty. Allow me to congratulate you on your having been chosen
                     by the Almighty to execute so important a work, and to have fulfilled so
                     successfully all the conditions of your arduous task.</p>

                     the world:—Christianity and the Catholic Church on the one side, socialistic
                     revolution and infidel philosophy on the other. Let us all work,<pb

               <p>This is undeniably the standard History of England. No library should be without
                  it. No other writer, it is universally acknowledged, has made use of the vast mass
                  of materials bearing on the History of England, with so much impartiality, skill,
                  industry and ability as LINGARD. MACAULAY and HALLAM, rivals in the same field,
                  have both acknowledged his superior merits. DANIEL WEBSTER asserted that there was
                  no other work worthy the name of History of England, except Lingard's. To the
                  lawyer who would make himself thoroughly acquainted with the growth of the common
                  law and the Con stitution of England, Lingard's History is indispensable. To the
                  general reader, perhaps there is no work so interesting and instructive. It
                  abounds in events and incidents related in a style unsurpassed for beauty and
                  elegance. The arrangement is clear and simple, and on the margin of each page are
                  to be found the dates of the occurrences related therein.</p>
