               </p> 
               <p>IN one of that picturesque group of Islets which gem the West Indian Archipelago, there is a beautiful little bay, or inlet, only or sufficient capacity for a half dozen vessels of light burden to ride at anchor at the same time. This inlet is of a semi-spheroid for, with a smooth white-gravelled beach on its circular side, while on the other rises a craggy cliff some fifty feet above the water at high tide, and still above this a terraced promontory, covered with rich and luxuriant vegetation.-The entrance to the bay is exceedingly narrow and irregular, and at some points only of sufficient width to admit a vessel of more than twenty-five feet beam. Half way up the terraced promontory, on a plateau leveled by the hands of man, there stands, or did stand some forty years ago, a stone dwelling of but on e story high, but covering a large space of ground. It was built in the most massive manner, to defy the terrific tornado which, at certain seasons, sweeps over the Islands, and levels everything in its course, unless erected with especial reference to this mighty scourge of the inhabitants of the Antilles. The roof of this edifice was flat, relieved by turrets like those of castle, and indeed, there were indications that, at an anterior period to the times of which we write, guns were mounted upon the walls, and that it was originally the stronghold of some petty monarch of the islet, or most probably the haunt of a band of sea-robbers. Tradition attributes its erection to the famous buccaneer Blackbeard, in the early days of his ruthless career.</p> 
               <p>It was now, however, a comparatively peaceful habitation, though strange scenes were still enacted beneath its roof. The grounds around it were tastefully arranged and fruits and flowers, and spicy shrubs, lent enchantment to this island villa. In the vale beyond, fields of cane, cotton and rice spread out for nearly a league. Sheltered, by the promontory, an hundred rods in the rear of the stone villa, was a group of strongly built huts, where dwelt the two hundred negroes of the present wealthy proprietor of this island paradise. It was, too, a secluded spot: viewed from the sea, it appeared as if but a barren, inhospitable rock, girt round with dangerous reefs, and high craggy cliffs. The mariner, especially in rough weather, took good care to give his bark a wide berth when in its seemingly perilous vicinity. But without venturing to enter upon a description<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6943-00000004"/> of its minor features, we here introduce an incident, which is necessary to the development of the singular plot of our truthful romance.</p> 
               <p>After an unusually sultry day, came a night of terror to all who dwelt on the most southerly of the islands, known as the Little Antilles. The sun on sinking beneath the waters of the Carribean Sea was of a fiery-red hue; murky, threatening clouds gathered into a lowering gloom, veiling the entire arch of heaven from view; the sea-birds arose from the craggy rocks, and with harsh, foreboding screams, took their flight for an inland haven; the waves rolled with a heavy swell, far beyond the usual tide-mark; the wind blew sullenly over the ocean, and doleful sounds echoed back from the rocky caverns of the Smugglers' Isle, while the fierce storm-god seemed to be mustering his relentless powers for devastating the heritage of man upon earth. Anon the tempest waxed more wrathfully, and the ridged, foam-crested waves rushed upon the iron-bound shore with terrible fury, seeming in their thundering, headlong incursions, to make the firm islet tremble. Out upon that furious sea scarcely a league from the rock-ribbed shore, a solitary vessel-an armed brig, with more than a hundred souls on board-was battling with the constantly increasing power of the elements. Sail after sail had been taken in, her upper spars had been sent down, and now under storm-sails, and everything made as snug as possible, her crew, at their posts, awaited the storm-god's most awful voice-the heaviest shock of the destructive tornado. Soon a thick, black, whirling mass came fiercely on, from out of which the forked lightning vividly flashed, followed by crashing, roaring thunder. The bold men-o' wars-men upon the deck of that fated craft, obeyed each order of their brave officers without fear or trembling. Not a man was there who did not feel that their last hour was approaching, for they could hear the roar of the breakers towards which the brig was driving, and they had no power to change her course, or avert the impending doom; yet never did a ship's crew look certain Health more resolutely in the face. The horrible blow came-all for a moment was impenetrable darkness! the men thought the brig was buried forever beneath the wave! but she arose upon a mighty sea, and the next moment was thrown upon her beam-ends! The lanyards of the main and fore-rigging were immediately cut, and both masts snapped as if but brittle reeds and went by the board. The windward guns had parted from their lashings, and falling to leeward, carried away the bulwarks flush with the deck, and rolled into the sea. The vessel righted, now nothing more than an unmanageable hulk, swept onward to destruction, with her human freight, at the will of the fiercely raging elements.-Each moment brought them nearer to the reef; hope for that vessel and crew was all gone. They who had often been victorious over their enemies, against fearful odds, were now to meet a foe, before whom the stoutest victor must be vanquished There they stood, silent yet resolute, without the power of affording themselves the slightest relief. Onward the floating mass was driven amid the fearfully agitated waters. Headlong the hulk struck upon a rock, but a high crested wave lifted her over, and she was dashed with enormous force upon the roughest part of the reef, and was rent into a thousand pieces!</p> 
               <p>Then there went up to Heaven cries for mercy, from the souls of drowning men, and wild, despairing yells and shrieks was heard even above the roaring of the elements! Several of the crew still desperately battled for life by clinging to the scattered fragments of the wreck, but one by one they were rapidly perishing by being dashed against the sharp-pointed rocks! Soon the dying shrieks of mortals were no longer heard, The violent tornado had done its worst-a brave crew had been sent into eternity! and now the wild winds and the wilder waves were wailing a requiem over their rude grave!</p> 
               <p>Morning dawned-the storm-god had appeased his terrible wrath; the ocean was tranquil; the sky was clear, and soft zephyrs floated over the isle of the Smugglers, on the rock-ribbed shores of which many a mariner had found eternal rest. The sun arose from out his ocean bed in regal majesty, making earth, sea and sky brilliantly beautiful, in contrast with the black, fearful and dismal night. At an early hour, the inhabitants of the islet were astir, to witness the devastation caused by the fiercest tornado which had been experienced for many years. Huts were unroofed, stately trees torn up by the roots, and whole fields of the choicest vegetation of the tropics were destroyed.</p> 
               <p>Dona Anita de Azvedo, the fair and youthful daughter of Don Fernando de Azvedo, the King of the Smugglers, ruled supreme over the island whenever her father was absent on his bold and thrifty expeditions to the Great Antilles, on to the ports of the Spanish main. None were they who dared to rebel against her power, and yet she ruled with as mild a sway as ever did a mother over her young children. At the time of the tornado, Azvedo was absent. On the morning after the storm, Anita summoned to her presence Don Juan Carcamo, one of the overseers of the estate. The summons pleased him, for he had dared to look with eyes of love upon the beautiful daughter of his master, though rarely it was that she gave him opportunity to address her. His aspirations never received the slightest encouragement from Dona Anita, for, notwithstanding he could claim some pretensions to noble appearance and noble blood, she believed he carried a black heart under his fair exterior. Juan quickly heeded her summons, and thus saluted her:</p> 
               <p>'Buenos dias, fair Senorita; a lovely day, a fair, lovely day, made more lovely to mine eyes, by beholding the beautiful Anita.'</p> 
               <p>'Cease thy foolish prating,' returned the maiden; 'presume not to address thy silly speeches to me. I called thee on business-hear me and heed what I have to say.'</p> 
               <p>'Pardon me, sweet--'</p> 
               <p>'Silence, minion!' she demanded, stamping her little foot indignantly upon the matting of the verandah of the stone villa, beneath which they stood. 'Senor,' asked she, suddenly assuming a respectful but dignified sir, 'did any of our people perish in the terrible tempest of last night?'</p> 
               <p>'Not one, fair lady,' replied Juan, in tones of less assurance.</p> 
               <p>'Holy Virgin be praised!'</p> 
               <p>'Dost know that any unlucky bark was upon our coast last night?'</p> 
               <p>'None was discovered, Senorita.'</p> 
               <p>'Didst hear any cries, as if from human beings in distress?'</p> 
               <p>'No, lady.'</p> 
               <p>'Now, by Santa Barbara, thou must have been deaf as the adder,' said Anita; 'for I did hear, above the wailings of the storm, the most heart-rending shrieks that ever fell upon mortal's car. Those shrieks came from shipwrecked seamen.'</p> 
               <p>'All is well with our people,' said Juan; 'I have myself visited the huts, and not one, I am assured, have received the slightest injury.'</p> 
               <p>'I spake of shipwrecked mariners,' said Anita.</p> 
               <p>'Thy father's vessels will not appear on the coast for a month yet,' said Juan, with coolness.</p> 
               <p>'Caracamo, are there no barks upon the seas save my father's? Are there no brave seamen to perish in the storm, save those who sail under him? Speak-tell me, what think'st thou were those mournful shrieks I heard, when the tempest was at its height?'</p> 
               <p>'Doubtless they came from the sea-from some unfortunate vessel, which, perchance was dashed to pieces upon the Devil's Reef!'</p> 
               <p>'And if so, all on board must have perished?' said Anita.</p> 
               <p>'The Devil's Reef offers little opportunity<pb n="12-13 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6943-00000005"/> for escape, to those who chance to run upon it in a storm like that of last night.'</p> 
               <p>'And I suppose you have not been down to the reef, or taken the slightest pain to ascertain. Am I right, Senor?'</p> 
               <p>'You speak the truth, lady,' answered Juan; 'it is no part of our instructions to look after every poor devil of a mariner, who chances to get cast away upon our island reefs. Those reefs are our protection-our fortifications-to fore warn intrusive strangers from visiting or inspecting our island paradise.'</p> 
               <p>'Our upon thee, for an inhuman wretch!' cried the indignant maiden;</p> 
               <p>Curcamo turned upon his heel, as if to depart.</p> 
               <p>'Stay!' she commanded; 'take with you half a score, of the most active of our slaves, and go and search along the windward shore of the island. If you discover any dead bodies, give them decent burial, and mark each grave with a stone. Should you discover any poor unfortunate still living, bear him hither.'</p> 
               <p>'It was thy father's command, Senorita that no stranger, whoever or what he might be, should ever be permitted to visit the island alive unless with his consent.'</p> 
               <p>Darst thou insinuate that Don Fernando de Azvedo, my father, bath no compassion in him?'</p> 
               <p>'Such was his command.'</p> 
               <p>'It was said in the heat of anger, to-be countermanded in his more cool moments,' replied Anita; 'but I do myself a folly to prate with thee. I countermand the order; and now, begone, and do my bidding, if thou wouldst have pity or favor from thy chief's daughter.'</p> 
               <p>Curcamo dared not disobey the commands of his young, beautiful, but somewhat imperious mistress, and he went forth reluctantly on the errand of money, muttering curses upon all outside barbarians. Despite his asseveration to the contrary, he well knew that a vessel went ashore on the reef during the night, and he supposed, as he really hoped, that all hands on board had perished; but if, by miracle, one had been saved, he resolved that he should perish.</p> 
               <p>'I like not the presumptuous Curcamo,' soliloquised Anita, as soon as he had gone; 'he is a heartless man, and would assassinate sooner than succor a stranger in peril. I'll not trust him.'</p> 
               <p>She turned and entered her boudoir, and summoning to her presence a quadroon slave, scarcely less beautiful than herself, she said to her,-</p> 
               <p>'Sybil, we must follow Curcamo to the reef, whence came those cries of human suffering. Bring hither my weapons; I saw danger lurking in the Spaniard's eyes.'</p> 
               <p>While Anita and Sybil were preparing themselves to follow the suspected Curcamo, he had summoned some eight or ten stalwart negroes, and pursued his way to the western shore of the isle, where extended reef of broken rocks of nearly half a league in extent. When he reached the most dangerous point, he halted and surveyed the scene.</p> 
               <p>'Ah! by San Christoval!' he exclaimed; 'Diavlo did a good work last night! These fragments strewn along the shore would tell a tale of woe to some eyes, but mine rejoiceth at the scene.'</p> 
               <p>He walked along the shore, apparently delighted with the evidence of destruction that met his gaze at every step.</p> 
               <p>'Ah!' he exclaimed, suddenly stopping and kicking with his foot an inanimate form, which lie half buried in the sand, and whose ghastly and bloody countenance, and fixed glassy eyes, told that there was no life with in 'here is one of the miserable wretches! dead as a statue, too-strip him, slaves-he may have booty about him. Our imperious mistress command is, to bury bodies, but not treasures. Here's another, and yet another-poor devils! 'the song that the gods sang in their ears last night must have been a terrific one! If I mistake not, these are the white livered visages of Americans! a set of hangdog

                   dog looking cutthroats at best. By the saints! here's a wretch not quite--'</p> 
               <p>He did not finish the sentence, but clutching a stilletto which was suspended to his girdle, he quickly thrust it to the heart of the dying seaman! No groan or shriek followed; the poor sufferer was already too near the portals of eternity to feel the keen blade of the sanguinary Spaniard! So quickly and quietly did the assassin perform his work that his followers, who were searching along the shore, did not perceive this diabolical act. He put up his bloody steel, and continued his search. He proceeded but few steps, when he discovered, half submerged in water and sea-weed, a young man, attired in a naval uniform. He bent over, him, and saw that his half-closed eyes still rolled in their sockets.</p> 
               <p>'By San Pedro!' he exclaimed exultingly, on espying the eagle-buttons on the youth's jacket; 'here is one of the eagle's fledge-lings. Accursed be the whole race!' and Curcamo raised his arm to strike the steel to the sufferer's heart.</p> 
               <p>The crack of a pistol was heard, and the uplifted arm fell powerless by his side! The assassin leaped to his feet as suddenly as if he had been stung by a deadly serpent, and uttered a hideous yell. He turned upon his heel, and beheld, the lovely Anita, and Sybil, the quadroon.</p> 
               <p>'Villain!' she exclaimed, her eyes flashing with anger, and levelling another pistol at the wretch; 'is it thus, Curcamo, that thou dost obey my behests? Cowardly assassin! I suspected thy treachery, and now that my suspicion is confirmed, I will make an example of thee;' and turning to the slaves, she commanded them to seize him, take away his weapons, and pinion him.</p> 
               <p>The negroes obeyed their beautiful mistress with alacrity, for they bore no love toward the Spaniard who had often brutally tyrannized over them. Curcamo made no resistance, and suffered himself to be served as Anita had commanded. The Stilletto, that had sent one soul to its last account, was still stained with his victim's blood. The maiden saw it, and took the weapon from the hand of the slave who had taken it from the prisoner's girdle.</p> 
               <p>'Whose blood is this, Curcamo?' demanded the maiden.</p> 
               <p>'Tis that of the enemy of our race, he answered, pointing to the corpse of the sea-man, whose heart's blood the stained blade had let out.</p> 
               <p>'Thou liest, Curcamo!' returned Anita; 'Because thou hast suffered perhaps a deserved punishment from the Americans, it argues not that they are our enemies.'</p> 
               <p>'Thy father would have applauded the act, said Curcamo in justification of his conduct; 'nor would he have arrested the blow which would have let the life blood from out the heart of any American, who had chanced to come to the isle.'</p> 
               <p>'Again, Curcamo, thou liest!' replied Anita; 'but my father shall judge of that and of thee on his return; meanwhile thou must lie a prisoner in the dungeon of the rock! Away with him!'</p> 
               <p>The assassin was led from the scene, and imprisoned in a small dungeon, hewn out of the rocky cliff, and so secure that escape were an impossibility, unless through accomplices outside.</p> 
               <p>Anita then approached the body of the still surviving youth, whose life she had saved by shooting a consequential person of the isle. She knelt over the sufferer, removed the seaweed which partially hid his form and with a handkerchief wiped the salt spray from his face. He was a singularly handsome youth (so thought the fair Senorita,) though now his cheeks were pale, and his eyes flashed not with their wonted lustre. She raised him up, so that his head rested upon her heaving bosom, and then laved his temples with water, which Sybil brought from a crevice in the rock. She ordered her slaves to construct a litter from the boughs of the palm, upon<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6943-00000007"/> which the unconscious youth was carefully placed, and borne to the villa of Don Fernando de Azvedo, there to receive every possible attention his situation required, from Anita and her slaves.</p> 
               <p>Without watching for the return of the flush of health to his cheeks, we must take the reader to other scenes, for the purpose of introducing a most notable character.</p>

               </p> 
               <p>ON the quarter-deck of an armed schooner, moored within a league of the fortress of Bahia Honda, stood don Fernando de Azvedo, the renowned contrabandist of the West Indian Isles. So extensive had been his operations, for a period of five years, among the merchants and mariners of the Cuban isle, he had gained the soubriquet of 'THE SMUGGLER KING;' and at the time of which we write, he owned a fleet of more than twenty sail, sufficiently powerful, if concentrated, to cope with all the cruisers of the Guarda Costa. But so skilfully and covertly did this bold outlaw arrange his expeditions that he had thus far escaped the vigilance of all who were sent in pursuit of him, though a large price was set upon his head.</p> 
               <p>Lest we shall make it appear that Don Fernando was a greater villain than he was, it will be necessary to dwell upon a few facts touching his earlier life, which were the primary cause of his standing in the relation of an outlaw to the government of the Spanish <choice>
                     <sic>sles</sic>
                     <corr>isles</corr>
                  </choice>.</p> 
               <p>He was of noble birth, born and nurtured among the grandees of Havana, had a large inheritance left him, and was regarded as one of the most promising youths of the isle. Possessed with the spirit of adventure, he entered the Spanish Navy, and by his bold, gallant conduct in many a well fought action, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and the command of an armed goleta, to cruise against Greek pirates in the Mediterranean, was entrusted to him. he continued in this service for two years, with unvarying success, when an incident occurred which caused his return, and the surrendering of his command. He was cruising among the isles of the Grecian archipelago, when, during the hours of the night, he suddenly came upon a pirate vessel in the very act of plundering a merchantman, whose crew they had barbarously massacred, together with several passengers. The life of one person only passengers. The life of one person only was spared-a lovely Grecian maiden, who was reserved for a worse fate by the savage buccaneers. Don Fernando attacked the piratical crew so suddenly and so vigorously, that not one of their number escaped the hands of the avengers! Ionia,(the name of the Greek girl,) as soon as the clash of arms had ceased, rushed upon the deck, and fell upon her knees a suppliant before the gallant Spaniard. He gently lifted her up, listened to her piteous tale, and bade her be cheerful. He swore to be her honorable protector, and to restore her to her father, who, she informed loveliest of the Ionian isles.</p> 
               <p>Don Fernando was true to his pledge; for after the lapse of a week, he had the satisfaction of delivering Ionia into the hands of her father, greatly to his joy, and the joy of all his regal household. He bestowed upon the noble preserver of his daughter gifts of untold value; but he offered not that which Don Fernando only coveted-the hand of the beautiful Ionia-and he therefore returned the rich gifts that had been given him.</p> 
               <p>'By St. Sophia!' exclaimed the Viceroy; 'why dost thou refuse my offerings, which my heart doth freely bestow?'</p> 
               <p>'I covet not wealth,' replied the Spanish commander; but thou possesseth a price less gem, more dear to my soul than all the treasures of the Grecian king?'</p> 
               <p>'Of what speakest thou?</p> 
               <p>'I speak not of jewels dug from mines,' replied Fernando; 'but of thy daughter, Ionia!'</p> 
               <p>'Ionia!'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, viceroy, I speak of the peerless Ionia. Pardon my presumption; but I do ask of thee to bestow her hand upon me; for be it know that our mutual affection hath already been pledged!'</p> 
               <p>'Presemptnous, indeed!' replied the viceroy, with anger gathering upon his brow; 'knowest thou not that Ionia's hand is pledged to Selim, the great Prince-the son and heir of the Grecian monarch?'</p> 
               <p>'Ionia breathed the unwelcome tale into my ear, but she loves him not.'</p> 
               <p>'What hath love to do with her duty? A high-born Ionian maid never permits love to step between her father's commands!'</p> 
               <p>'She hath made a holy vow never to wed the prince!'</p> 
               <p>'And I have made a solemn vow that she shall wed none other!'</p> 
               <p>A rustling noise and light footsteps were heard, and Ionia appeared and knelt at her father's feet.</p> 
               <p>'Recall, dear father, that solemn vow, or slay thy child!'</p> 
               <p>Anger and amazement sat upon the stern visage of the viceroy. He raised Ionia to his arms, and without giving vent to his rage, he intimated to Don Fernando that he desired to be alone with his daughter. The Spaniard withdrew from the apartment, and seated himself in an arbor, not far distant, where within the hour, they had pledged to each other eternal love.</p> 
               <p>Some minutes elapsed, when a shrill cry, burst upon Fernando's ear. He started to his feet, drew his sword and rushed toward the door. A dozen bayonets opposed his entrance! yet with his trusty weapon he reached the hall, just in time to behold two female attendants leading or rather forcing the fair Ionia up the grand stair-case. In his despair he would have followed and rescued her; but he was confronted by the Viceroy himself!</p> 
               <p>'Madman; what wouldst thou do! exclaimed the Greek; 'wouldst violate the sanctity of my palace? Wouldst abuse the hospitality here offered thee?</p> 
               <p>Fernando sheathed his sword, and drawing himself up with offended dignity, said mildly:</p> 
               <p>'Nay, your highness; never let it be said that a grandee of Spain can even be wanting in gratitude. Pardon my rashness.'</p> 
               <p>With these words, Fernando turned to leave the palace.</p> 
               <p>'Stay, Senor; I owe thee for my Ionia's preservation; I would repay thee.'</p> 
               <p>'Ionia is the price/'</p> 
               <p>'That cannot be.'</p> 
               <p>'All thy pelf would be to me no recompense. Farewell!'</p> 
               <p>With a proud mien, Fernando strode away from the palace, and pursued his way toward the quay, where his bargemen remained awaiting his pleasure. The light barge flew swiftly over the water, and in a few minutes was aboard of the goleta, and gave orders for making sail with all possible despatch.</p> 
               <p>Fernando turned a longing eye toward the palace which held his heart's treasure, and his attention was arrested by the waving of a little white flag or handkerchief from a casement in one of the upper apartments. He called for his glass, and gazed through it at the object. The little signal was held be a fair hand: it could be the hand of none other than Ionia, thought Fernando. Presently he descried, hastening toward the quay, a youth, who, by his rich dress, he knew to be one of the viceroy's pages. A light bark, manned by Moorish slaves, was soon dancing on the sun-gilt ripples of the harbor, and<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6943-00000008"/> sped, its way toward the goleta. The page leaped aboard, and bore a pressing invitation for him to return to the palace, and to receive the proffered gifts.</p> 
               <p>'Tell thy royal master,' said Fernando, 'that his gifts I contemn, and were he not the father of the gentle Ionia, I should despise him too!'</p> 
               <p>The youth then produced a ring of great value, and giving it to Fernando, whispered in his ear 'IONIA.' A billet was also placed in his hand by the page, who, saluting the Spaniard, leaped aboard the little boat, and was quickly rowed ashore.</p> 
               <p>Don Fernando opened the missive, which read as follows:</p> 
               <p>"If thy love be honorable, and if thou wouldst hazard the risk of approaching the southern wing of the palace at midnight, Ionia will place herself forever under thy protection, and fly with thee to the island home thou hast told me of.</p> 
               <p>"If the bent of thy mind be of my inclining, display a white flag, at the meridian hour at mast-head."</p> 
               <p>'By San Iago!' said Fernando to himself; 'if I act not upon this suggestion, may all the saints anathematize me for cowardice!'</p> 
               <p>At twelve, precisely, the white signal was run up, and floated in the rays of the meridian sun.</p> 
               <p>Twelve hours afterward, to a minute, a score or more or armed men suddenly appeared under the walls of the southerly wing of the viceroy's palatial abode, and as the last stroke of the clock of St. Sophia's fell upon their ears, a female form emerged from the upper casement, and descended slowly to the earth, upon a ladder made of ropes! It was Ionia! and as her foot touched the ground, she was clasped in her lover's embrace!</p> 
               <p>The report of an arquebus, fired by one of the sentinels on duty at a postern some fifty yards distant, broke the stillness of the midnight hour, and aroused the viceroy's slumbering guards! Soon the entire household was in commotion, but none could explain the cause of the alarm. The sentinel, who fired his arquebus, could only say that he saw a group of suspicious looking men beneath the southern walls. The viceroy despatched a female attendant to the apartments of his daughter. What she there discovered revealed Ionia's flight! When communicated to the viceroy, the flew into an ungovernable rage, for he at once suspected that she had dishonored his house by eloping with a Spaniard. Pursuit was ordered, and a missive sent to the commanding officer of the fortress, to sink Don Fernando's vessel if she attempted to leave the harbor!</p> 
               <p>But all these orders were given too late. The bird had flown, for ere the officer of the fort had received his despatch, and, got his rarely used ordnance in readiness to blaze away, Don Fernando's craft had already passed the batteries, and speeding her way seaward under a nine knot breeze.</p> 
               <p>A few days elapsed, and he entered the port of Lisbon, where, after espousing Ionia, he surrendered his commission, and embarked for his native isle, the Queen of the Antilles.</p> 
               <p>Some six or eight years passed away of unalloyed happiness to the bridegroom and bride, when an event took place which blasted their hopes for the future. The then reigning government of the island had become unpopular; whisperings of discontent were heard throughout the island; a <choice>
                     <sic>dee</sic>
                     <corr>deep</corr>
                  </choice> and dangerous conspiracy was formed to throw off the Spanish yoke altogether, and among its most prominent and powerful leaders, was Don Fernando de Azvedo, who, Spaniard though he was, loved liberty better than tyranny. Unluckily for Cuba and for humanity, before the conspiracy had fully ripened, a traitor disclosed all to the ears of the Governor-General. Arrests followed, and Azvedo barely escaped from the tyrant's clutches, with his only child, a little girl of seven years of age; his wife, Ionia, having been previously removed to a distant part of the island, on account of her failing health. The government confiscated his princely estates, and offered a reward for his head; but the severest blow of all, these events hastened the death of his beloved Ionia.</p> 
               <p>On leaving the island, Don Fernando took a solemn vow he would seek vengeance for his irreparable losses. A voyage of three days brought the vessel into the little haven, or inlet, which we have briefly described. The stone villa was then but little better than a ruin, and everything on the islet was in a rude and uncultivated state. There was no human being there to dispute possession with him, and after a careful examination of its features, he resolved, Crusoe-like, to constitute himself monarch of all he surveyed.</p> 
               <p>After the lapse of another decade, a period of almost unvarying success, we again behold in the refugee, the daring outlaw, Don Fernando, now the Smuggler King, whose untold wealth, and secret business connection with hundreds of the most influential men of the isles, made him a terror almost to the Cuban government.</p> 
               <p>As he stands upon the deck of his favorite craft, 'Ionia.' dressed in the peculiar costume in which he was wont to receive visitors, he looks indeed a 'King!' We behold him within reach of the guns of his enemy, bidding defiance to their power, and calmly awaiting an event which shall decides his future career!</p>

               </p> 
               <p>WE are now better enabled to appreciate the character of the Smuggler King, That he began his career in life with good purposes; none can gainsay, but circumstances had urged him onward to commit deeds, which, to say the least, were criminal in the eyes of the despotic edicts of his government. He had now satiated his vengeance against those who had wantonly deprived him of his heritage and his home, and gladly would he make peace with the tyrannical government, and return to his native isle to enjoy even the few rights of Cuban citizenship. In furtherance of his wishes, some of his former influential friends and associates, had made frequent overtures to the authorities, to have removed the ban of outlawry, which weighed heavily upon him, spite of the unvarying success which had so long attended him in his contraband trade. The government, too, had felt his power, but had steadily refused to make any compromise with an outlaw, until, at length, the Governor-General yielded to the pressing solicitations of Azvedo's friends, to send a commissioner to treat with him. And it was to meet this commissioner that he boldly entered the harbor of Bahia Honda, with a single vessel, which, to all appearances, was insufficiently armed and manned to cope with any one of the island cruisers. Azvedo had himself with more<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6943-00000009"/> than ordinary care on the morning that he was to meet with the Court Pedrazza, who had received full instructions from the Governor how to proceed in this novel piece of diplomacy.</p> 
               <p>The hour designated for the arrival of the count had arrived. the Smuggler, unattended went upon deck, and paced it to and fro, busy with a thousand conflicting emotions.-He turned his eyes seaward, an beheld, just outside of the harbor, and armed cruiser.-The thought instantaneously flashed upon his brain that treachery was at work-that this craft had been sent there to intercept him.</p> 
               <p>'Ah! by the internal powers!' he exclaimed, soliloquising; 'blood will yet be spilled! My hands are yet unstained; but I fear the sanguinary hour approaches; an hour when I shall be compelled to defend myself against terrible odds!'</p> 
               <p>The Smuggler took up his glass and descried two boats coming down the harbor, filled with armed men. A white flag floated above the stern of the foremost boat.</p> 
               <p>'A peaceful mission, indeed!' continued Azvedo; 'a white flag, and three score musketeers! Truly, I am a man much feared! Treachery, by San Iago! Yet, they shall not capture the much dreaded contrabandist alive, or without a fearful sacrifice of life among themselves.'</p> 
               <p>The boats approached, and hailing Don Fernando, they came alongside, and boarded the Ionia at the gangway.</p> 
               <p>The Court Pedrazza, followed by a corps of musketeers, approached the Smuggler, and thus addressed him:</p> 
               <p>'Seuor Azvedo, his excellency, the Governor General, knowing that you had entered the harbor of Bahia Honda, for the purpose of hearing his views upon a proposition which has been laid before his council, has been pleased to honor me as the instrument through which the whole matter may be amicably arranged.</p> 
               <p>'Welcome, Count Pedrazza,' replied Azvedo, his eyes glancing frowingly at the grim looking line of soldiers in the rear of his illustrious visitor; 'but thou wouldst have been thrice welcome, wert thou not backed by this formidable display of soldiery.'</p> 
               <p>'Pardon me, Senor,' said the count, apologetically; 'it was in my instructions to the prepared for every possible emergency. Yet, be assured we come with friendly intent.'</p> 
               <p>'And I suppose that that government cruiser in the offing is there with friendly intent?' said Azvedo, enquiringly, and with a tone of satire.</p> 
               <p>'I have no control, Senor,' over her movements,' replied Pedrazza, slightly confused at the penetrating gaze and significant queries of the noble looking man before him.-'My mission is to recall thee to thy country's service and allegiance; to remove the ban of outlawry, and to restore thee to the privileges which thou once enjoyed.'</p> 
               <p>'Hast full authority to accomplish so much, Senor?'</p> 
               <p>'I have,' replied Pedrazza; 'this power is vested in me by his excellency himself, as I shall convince thee.'</p> 
               <p>'The Governor-General is more generous than he is wont to be,' remarked the Smuggler, with a slightly ironical tone in his speech.</p> 
               <p>'His excellency has full knowledge of the immense wealth thou hast gained in a traffic dishonorable and inhuman--'</p> 
               <p>'Slander, Senor! vile slander!' interrupted Azvedo; 'humanity hath suffered much less in the mode in which I have accumulated my wealth, than it hath in the manner in which Gonzala, the Governor, hath filled his private coffers; and if this bay could speak, it would tell a tale of hellish outrages upon poor, suffering humanity, that would almost cause the blood to tingle in midnight murder's cheek. Oh! count! I do know this Gonzala well, and it were not wise in him to pursue the Smuggler with an unrelenting will. Therefore, count, let's have a truce to this bandying of criminal charges. Outlaw, as I am stigmatized, my soul hath not so much to answer for as he who holds a nation's proscription over my head.'</p> 
               <p>'This reviling of his excellency, whom the people love honor, will not advance thy cause,' said Pedrazza.</p> 
               <p>'Canst revile a cringing, sycophantic, sanguinary monster?' exclaimed the Smuggler; 'By my faith, count, thou knowest not Gonzala. He began his career as a slaver of cattle, and no man in all Seville could give an ox a surer and more deadly blow. His fame as a butcher reached the Inquisitorial Council. This body called him from the occupation of a slayer in the mysterious chambers and dark dungeons of the Inquisition, did he torture and murder hundreds of innocent men and women! He gradually rose in his diabolical profession, until he became the Chief of Inquisitars, and boasted of having a band of a hundred assassins to murder secretly all who stood in the way of his ambition. He amassed wealth and power, and demanded the Governor-Generalship of his beautiful isle! More, much more, of Gonzala's history could I relate; but I warrant me, thou hast heard enough.'</p> 
               <p>''Twere criminal to hear more,' said Pedrazza.</p> 
               <p>'But tell me, count, thou spokest of my immense wealth,' resumed the Smuggler; 'what hath that, I prithee tell me, to do with this 'pardon' that I am to receive from a greater criminal than myself. By San Diego! methinks I can almost answer the question. The sordid tyrant doth covet my treasures! Is it not so?</p> 
               <p>'To be plain with thee, Senor, thy wealth must purchase thy pardon, and the restoration of thy former rights and privileges,' answered Azvedo.'</p> 
               <p>'Prithee, count, tell me, what is the sum named?'</p> 
               <p>'That thou canst best answer.'</p> 
               <p>'Hw so?'</p> 
               <p>'The price is simply that which thou hast gained in illicit commerce.'</p> 
               <p>'Why, look thee, count, 'tis more than the combined wealth of the ten richest men in all Cuba!'</p> 
               <p>'The greater the sum the more nobly and satisfactorily will it repay that which thou has indirectly taken from the revenues of the islands.</p> 
               <p>'Well, count, ere we conclude our negotiation let us fully understand each other,' said the Smuggler. 'In the first place, answer me truly: is this attempt to compound with a main, whom you deem a rich outlaw, sanctioned by the court of Madrid; or doth Gonzala, the Governor-General, take the responsibility, for the purpose of adding enough to his own coffers to corrupt a nation, or purchase for himself a throne?'</p> 
               <p>'This is to be a negotiation simply between the Governor-General and Don Fernando da Azvedo,' answered Pedrazza. 'The king or court of Madrid is to know nothing of the matter.'</p> 
               <p>'By all the saints! the governor doth compliment me highly,' said the Smuggler, ironically; 'he doth take me for a precious villain! But, outlaw or smuggler, I am not so consummate a rascal as to be party in such an infamous transaction. Far more politic would it be for me to sail boldly into the first port of Spain, present myself before the monarch, replenish the exhausted exchequer of Spain, denounce the wretch, Gonzala, and ask for the restoration of my rights and estates.'</p> 
               <p>'Thy head would answer for such reckless audacity!'</p> 
               <p>'Now, by my hopes, I have a better opinion of the monarch of Spain. At all events, it were nobler and safer to do thus, than to yield to the temptations which Gonzala would place before me.'</p> 
               <p>'Then thou refuseth to treat with his excellency?' enquired Pedrazza.</p> 
               <p>'If thou dost come to offer me a free and unconditional pardon from the Governor-General, sanctioned by His Most Christian Majesty, providing I will place a certain sum<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6943-00000010"/> in Spain's empty coffers, commend me to his excellency, and say I will treat with his worthy agent, the Count Pedrazza. But, if thy mission here be for the purpose of compounding with gold, any crime or crimes which I may be supposed to be guilty of, then, count, do I return scorn for the base proposition.'</p> 
               <p>'Decide not thus rashly, Senor,' resumed the count. 'It was only after repeated and earnest solicitations of, those who profess to be thy ardent friends, that his excellency deigned to establish the great precedent of pardoning one who has so long preyed upon the commercial revenues of the islands. Consider well, Azvedo; nothing will induce him to renew the proposition.'</p> 
               <p>'Villains only consider of villainous propositions,' said the Smuggler. 'I have decided, and thou hast my answer!'</p> 
               <p>'Then in the name of His Most Christian Majesty, I do order thy arrest! Officer,' he continued, 'turning to the commander of the musketeers, 'perform your duty!'</p> 
               <p>'Ha, ha, ha,!' laughed the Smuggler, loudly. 'Azvedo, the Smuggler King, prisoner to the most valiant and noble Count Pedrazza, minion of the arch-villain, Gonzala! ha, ha, ha! This is too good a jest! Take to thy barge, count-keep that treacherous white flag flying! It may save thee from a watery grave!'</p> 
               <p>'Thy taunting tongue will not save thee! Thou art, bold Smuggler, fully in my power Seize the outlaw, soldats, and drag him to the boats!'</p> 
               <p>'Cubans! soldiers! said Azvedo, with dignity, and with the utmost coolness; 'if thou hast desire longer to live, disobey they leader's reckless command! But if thou art tired of life, make but the attempt to obey him, and as sure as there is a heaven or hell, I will, the next moment, send thy souls to the places, whither they do justly belong! Be-hold!' he continued, taking from within a coil of rigging which stood behind him, something which resembled a small rope; 'this is but a train of power, which leads to a well-filled magazine directly beneath thy feet! Let me but discharge this pistol to the end of this quick fuse, and in less than a second thou art blown to atoms!'</p> 
               <p>Pedrazza started back with horror depicted in his countenance! The musketeers instinctly turned upon their heels, and scrambled quickly over the bulwarks into the boats! and in one minute the Smuggler King was the only being standing upon the Ionia's deck! There was an expression of such solemn determination in the Smuggler's countenance, that conviction was carried to the heart of every man that he would put his awful threat into execution.'</p> 
               <p>'Buenos dias, Senor Pedrazza,' said Azvedo, as the count descended from the gangway. 'Thou wert deceived when made to believe that the Smuggler's crew had deserted him. It is, indeed, true, that there's not a single living soul on board of this vessel, save myself. But I am not powerless; tho' my threat to perform the desperate act of blowing up the schooner and sacrificing myself, is power sufficient to prevent my being taken thy prisoner. I have means thou wottest not of, as I shall take pleasure in convincing thee.'</p> 
               <p>Saying which, the Smuggler run up a small signal, attached to the peak halliards. In a few seconds, from behind a rock, not more than two hundred yards distant, six boats, manned by from fifteen to twenty men each, suddenly appeared, and bent their course directly toward the schooner with all the speed which a dozen good oarsmen to each boat could propel them.</p> 
               <p>The count and the musketeers were amazed, and put the prows of their boats towards the inner harbor with as much celerity as possible.</p> 
               <p>'Adieu, count!' cried Azvedo; 'and bless your lucky stars that the Smuggler King compels you take a voyage with him, in view of a rich ransom. Give my compliments to the Governor General; tell him if his treasury is very low I will negotiate with him for a few millions, providing he will furnish ample security.'</p> 
               <p>The smuggler's crew, in the boats, were soon upon the deck of the Ionia, and a more active, athletic, resolute band of men never trod the deck of a vessel.</p> 
               <p>'Up with the anchor, boys! make all sail! Mr. Conrad,' said the bold Smuggler, addressing his first officer, a noble looking fellow, 'there's a cruiser in the offing awaiting our approach.'</p> 
               <p>'Si, Senor Capitan,' replied Conrad; 'but think you she will dare to fight us?</p> 
               <p>'If her commander hath the usual courage of revenue officers, depend upon it he will take to his heels; but if he will take to his heels; but if he hath the pluck of one of those Yankee lumber drogers, he will surely give us battle. At all events we must be prepared for him.'</p> 
               <p>The anchor was quickly aweigh. Sail was made upon the schooner, and her prow was directed seaward.</p> 
               <p>'Clear the deck for action! shouted the Smuggler, after surveying the cruiser closely through his glass. 'Mr. Conrad, we shall have need of all our guns, if that cruiser shows fight.'</p> 
               <p>'Si, capitan,' replied the lieutenant comprehending the chief's meaning,</p> 
               <p>There were but six guns visible on the deck of the Ionia, but on either side of the companion-way, beneath the quarter-deck, which extended to the gangway, four brass-pieces, of beautiful workmanship, mounted on easy-working carriages, were cunningly concealed. Several panels were readily removed, and these formidable weapons were exposed to view. The men seized them by the drag-ropes, drew forth, and their brazen muzzles were soon shining from out four port-holes, which seemed to have been made almost by magic, thus transforming the six gun schooner into one of ten guns.</p> 
               <p>Boarding pikes and cutlasses, muskets and cutlasses, nearly made cartridges and cannon balls, were quickly handed up, and arranged in the most convenient places for ready use.</p> 
               <p>Every man worked with a hearty will, and seemed eager for a fight, for the smell of burnt powder was a luxury they had not enjoyed for many months; not since the event of capturing an African slaver, with two hundred slaves on board, said to have been the property of Gonzala, who, instead of being handed over to severe task-masters in Cuba, were sent to the Smuggler's Isle, where they enjoyed a comfortable home, and comparative freedom.</p> 
               <p>The revenue cruiser was standing off and on, evidently awaiting the near approach of the' Smuggler. The Ionia stood boldly out, under a full press of canvas, as if totally regardless and heedless of the near proximity of an enemy that had been sent to intercept her; and there was nothing in the Ionia's appearance or actions which indicated to those on board the cruiser that she was in any manner prepared for battle. The Ionia had unusually high bulwarks, which concealed all that was transpiring on board. A portion of her crew, toe, were below, although there were a sufficient number crouching by their guns, to work one battery, and ready at a moment's warning to resume their stations.</p> 
               <p>The Ionia, with the wind blowing free on her quarter, was standing W. N. W., while the cruiser was close hauled and standing in precisely an opposite direction. When they had lessened the distance between them to half a mile, a shotted gun was fired astern of the schooner, as a polite signal for her to heave-to, a summons which the Smuggler took no cognizance of. Another gun soon followed, and the shot whizzed across the deck of the Ionia, in a diagonal course just about the foremast, doing no other damage than making a small rent in the foresail. Still the smuggler altered not a point of his course, and taking no heed whatever of this peremptory summons to heave-to.</p> 
               <p>The two vessels soon neared each other within speaking distance, when the tafferel, and shouted through his trumpet-</p> 
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6943-00000011"/> 
               <p>'Schooner, ahoy!'</p> 
               <p>'Helloa!' was the response from the quarter-deck of the Ionia, in an almost indifferent tone.</p> 
               <p>'Heave-to, or I'll blow you out of the water!'</p> 
               <p>Ay, ay, sir,' returned the Smuggler King. 'Hard starboard! steady!' said he to the helmsman.</p> 
               <p>The Ionia came gracefully up into the wind, and by the time her topsail and top-gallantsail were backed, the two vessels were within a musket shot of each other.</p> 
               <p>'What schooner is that!' demanded the revenue officer, peremptorily.</p> 
               <p>'The Ionia.'</p> 
               <p>'Who is her commander?'</p> 
               <p>'Captain Azvedo.'</p> 
               <p>'Whither bound?'</p> 
               <p>'To Matanzas, Havana, and all along the coast. What armed vessel is that?' questioned the Smuggler in return.</p> 
               <p>'The Spanish revenue-cutter Firebrand, Senor Anguera, commander. If I mistake not, yours is the smuggling-craft we are in search of. In the name of His Majesty, I command you to send a boat aboard with your papers!'</p> 
               <p>'Many thanks, Senor Captain, for your excessively polite invitation,' replied the Smuggler, ironically, 'but I must positively decline it.'</p> 
               <p>'What flag do you sail under?'</p> 
               <p>'Mine! answered Azvedo, with kingly dignity.</p> 
               <p>'Again I ask, under what flag do you sail?'</p> 
               <p>'Under the flag of His Independent Majesty, Fernando, the King of the Smugglers! Behold!'</p> 
               <p>In another moment or two, a ball of bunting, went up suddenly to the mast-head, and as it rolled out it presented, instead of the crown and pillars of Old Spain, a simple red flag, with two words in Spanish in the centre, answering to the English term of 'Free Commerce!'</p> 
               <p>'Surrender! or I shall open my batteries upon you!' cried the Spanish officer.</p> 
               <p>'Not while there's a live man upon my deck!' answered the Smuggler in tones of defiance. 'But permit me to advise thee, Se nor capitan, to go thy way, and not attempt to interfere with us peaceable and independent free-traders!'</p> 
               <p>'Insolent outlaw!' cried the angry officer; 'I give thee two minutes to surrender!-Shouldst thou refuse I shall order a broad side to be fired into you!'</p> 
               <p>'Fire away, Senor!' replied the Smuggler; I shall return shot for shot!'</p> 
               <p>Leaving his post on the quarter-deck, Azvedo went forward, and ordered his gunners to pour in a broadside the moment the flash of the cruiser's guns was seen; and he instructed them to elevate their pieces, so as to make havoc among the spars, sails and rigging, for if possible he desired to prevent the effusion of human gore!'</p> 
               <p>The two minutes elapsed; at the last second the cruiser's commander gave the word to fire, and a broadside of six eighteen-pound carronades, came crashing into the tough sides of the Ionia, without doing any material damage below the water lines, or injuring a man upon the deck! The effect of the Smuggler's broadside, fired almost simultaneously, was such as to carry the whole top hamper, from ten feet above the deck, completely by the board! but not a single shot took effect below the bulwarks, not a life being lost, nor a drop of blood spilled; but there lay the cruiser, an unmanageable hulk, completely dismasted, and everything on deck in a state of utter confusion; but, fortunately, she was near the harbor, and the brief action had been witnessed from the walls of the fortress, and from other commanding points of the Bay. Notwithstanding the disabled craft was completely at the mercy of the contrabandist, he refrained from firing a single shot at her. Night coming on, the Ionia put out to sea, leaving his enemy to be towed into port by her own boats.</p> 
                
               <p>'Dios de Cielo! No blood shed yet!' soliloquised the Smuggler King, after surveying carefully, through a glass, the 'full effect of his broadside. 'Yet, I do apprehend, the time is not far distant when I shall be forced to imbrue these hands in human gore!'</p> 
               <p>That night proved a tempestuous one, yet the gallant little bark of the contrabandista rode out the gale in safety, while many a stout ship suffered severely. When daylight appeared, the wind had abated, and the waves which had rolled mountain high during the night had gone down, and the ocean presented a comparatively even surface.</p> 
               <p>At a distance of two leagues, a large ship was descried, with her topmasts gone, and apparently in distress. The course of the schooner was immediately changed, and bore down for the ship, to render her assistance if required. The strange vessel was lying about three miles to the northward of a small bay, on the shores of which was a small village inhabited as was supposed by wreckers, but there were rumors afloat that, when no friendly hurricane drove richly ladened barks upon their iron-ribbed coast, they did not scruple to go forth upon the high seas, and commit the most barbarous atrocities ever committed by savage pirates.</p> 
               <p>As the schooner neared the ship the contrabandist saw beneath the ship's quarter, a boat filled with armed men, one of whom had climbed to the ship's taferel, and was struggling with one who apparently was endeavoring to prevent him from boarding, while another, with sword in hand, was clinging to a rope, and endeavoring to ascend the ship's bulky side. [SEE ENGRAVING.] The struggle between the two on the taferel quickly terminated, by both falling into the sea, and, clasped in a deathly embrace they found an ocean grave!</p> 
               <p>'God of Heaven!' exclaimed Don Fernando. 'Look, Conrad; a band of bloody cut-throats are on boards of that ship! Pipe all hands to quarters! have the guns shotted, and arm the men for boarding.'</p> 
               <p>The boatswain's whistle quickly summoned the men to their stations, and before the buccaneers (for such they were, engaged in their sanguinary work) discovered an armed craft coming down with the speed of the wind, she had ranged almost within musket-shot. At the larboard gangway were four other boats, the crews of which had succeeded in boarding the ship.</p> 
               <p>'Give that boat under the stern a shot, Mr. Conrad,' ordered the Smuggler.</p> 
               <p>'Si, capitan.'</p> 
               <p>A gun, loaded with grape and langrel-shot was brought to bear, and discharged. The effect was tremendous, for when the smoke cleared away, not a man was to be seen, and but a few fragments were visible; indeed, all that remained of boat or crew.</p> 
               <p>Their comrades, on the ship's deck, now became thoroughly alarmed at their situation, and ceasing their butchery of defenceless men and women, they turned to defend their own lives against a foe, whom they dreaded more than any other power; for the Smuggler King had more than once chastised the bloody Pirates of the Antilles.</p> 
               <p>A part of the buccaneers made a rush for the boats, but a discharge or two from the carronades of the Ionia, stove the boats, and every one of the cowardly wretches perished. The remainder of the buccaneers ranged themselves along the bulwarks to make a desperate resistance; but it proved a feeble one. The impetuosity of the bold smugglers overcame all opposition. Ere the Ionia touched the ship's side, Don Fernando, by the aid of a rope, swung himself upon the ship's deck, directly in the midst of the piratical ruffians, followed in every possible way by his daring followers. The bloody strife commenced, but it was of short duration. Not one of the sea-murderers returned to their haunt to tell of the fate of their comrades!</p> 
               <p>It was a fearful but just retribution; for<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6943-00000012"/> the blood-thirst villains had butchered the entire crew, with the exception of three persons, one of whom was the captain and two sailors. They had also slain every passenger, numbering thirteen, including a Spanish Marquis, who had come from Madrid, for the purpose of visiting the sunny isle of Cuba for the first time. He belonged to an ancient and wealthy family, and was honored by the monarch with despatches to Gonzala, the Governor General.</p> 
               <p>Upon his knees, did the commander of the Spanish merchantman, pour forth to his unexpected deliverers his unbounded gratitude. He had given up all hope of life, and already was the blood-stained blade suspended over his head, when turned aside by the bold leader of the contrabandists. He told his pitiful story of the attack of the pirates, and the hellish scenes that followed; and in reply to a question of Don Fernando, he gave a complete list of all the passengers who had been murdered, with some interesting particulars, especially touching the Marquis, the king's despatch bearer. Touching the latter Don Fernando seemed particularly interested, and after musing for a few moments' private conversation with the captain, who invited his heroic preserver into the cabin. The subject of their interview will be out of place to reveal here, but will be brought to light in the course of another chapter. At its conclusion, however, Don Fernando re-appeared on deck, and summoning his lieutenant, he gave him some orders of a very important nature to the smugglers. A crew of twenty men were then detailed from the Ionia to man the Spanish ship. Her decks were soon cleared of the dead bodies, new spars were rigged, and the merchantman parted company with the schooner, the latter under command of Conrad, the smuggler's lieutenant, while the Smuggler King himself, incognita, took passage in the merchantman for the port of Havana.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">HAVANA. MASQUERADE AT THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S. THE MARQUIS VILLEFANA AND SUITE. DONA ISIDORA BELLERMA. GONZALAS INTERVIEW WITH A STRANGE MASK. A GAMING SCENE. GONZALA THE VICTIM.</head> 
               <p>IT was a gala day in the gay city of Havana. the Dons and Donas had donned their holiday apparel, and wore forth to enjoy the various sports which had been got up for their gratification-the indispensable bull Fight of course not excepted. But the chief feature of the occasion, especially among the families of the grandees, was the masquerade to be given by the Governor-General Gonzales, at his palace; and the chief business of the day, among the pleasure-loving portion, who had been honored with invitations, was in giving the final finish to the appropriate costumes which has been prepared for the grand masquerade. The affair was-expected to be unusually brilliant in consequence of the well-accredited report that the marquis Villefana, a commissioner of the crown, with his suite, who had but the day previous arrived from Spain, would honor the occasion by his august presence.</p> 
               <p>Evening came, and a more lovely one was never seen in the tropics; but the palace and gardens of Gonzala, vied in brilliancy with the bright, starry firmament. A large orchestra of talented musicians enlivened the gay scene with the liveliest and most enchanting strains. The wealthiest and the most noble gentlemen, and the most beautiful ladies, known in the isle, graced the elegantly furnished and ample salons of the palace, attired mostly in brilliant costumes, with a simple mask, while contrasted with all the dazzling elegance and display, there might have been seen an occasional personage, 'with monkish looking robes or grave dominoes, which covered, in most instances, the richest and most beautiful costumes.</p> 
               <p>The festivities of the evening were at their height, when the noble Marquis Villefana and his suite were announced. He, together with his followers, were received by Gonzala with marked civility and gracious condescension. While the orchestra played a grand National March, the towering figure of a noble looking gentlemen, apparently about forty five years of age, leaning slightly upon the arm of the Governor, marked into the midst of the brilliant assemblage, where he was introduced by a long array of titles to the most distinguished personages present, of both sexes. All eyes were, as may by supposed, levelled upon the noble Spaniard; and had he been peasant-born, he could not have failed less to attract the attention of all who love to gaze upon perfection of form and feature in man. In stature he was just six feet and three inches, finely proportioned in body and limb, indicating great muscular power; indeed, his leg and arm would have served to model the limbs of a statue of Hercules from. his features were purely Castilian, and though an extremely handsome man, he had none of the insipidity of what is commonly called facial beauty, for he looked every inch a hero-a second Achilles. His step, though majestic, was graceful; in truth, his every movement shew the dignified hero and the accomplished courtier combined. He wore the costume of a nobleman of the reign of Philip II., of great off richness and magnificence, and which set off his majestic proportions to great advantage. To a green and gold-enamelled belt, which crossed the right-shoulder, was suspended a straight sword, with a chased gold scabbard, the cross-shaped hilt of which was suspended to a gold chain from his waist-belt. His suite consisted of ten fine looking men, with faces somewhat bronzed by the sea voyage. There were more simply attired than the Marquis, but even their costumes eclipsed those of the gayest gallants of Havana.</p> 
               <p>Marked attention was also paid to these strangers, and it was not long before they had elicited the some what familiar attention of some of the fairest Senoritas, that graced his excellency's fete. But the noblest, the most the beautiful, the cynosure of all eyes, Dona Isidora Bellerma, the richest merchant in Havana, or, rather we should say in all the Spanish isles, was reserved to be the partner in the dance of Gonzala's distinguished guest, the noble Marquis Villefana. Beautiful, graceful, witty, and accomplished, as was this daughter of the proud and influential house of Bellerma, the noble stranger did not suffer, in the least degree, in comparison with the famed belle, while they threaded the mazy dance, or while conversing and promenading together.</p> 
               <p>It was not long, however, before the Marquis surrendered his lovely partner to the hands of one of the gallants, who had been almost distracted with envy at the inroads the magnificent, guest was making towards the heart of the acknowledged belle of the Cuban isle.</p> 
               <p>The Marquis, slightly fatigued with exertions which he had not of late been accusations to, surrendered himself into the hands of his illustrious host, Gonzala, and by him was escorted to the verandah to enjoy a delicious cigar; after which, they promenaded through the luxuriant and adorned grounds, now brilliantly illuminated, to which a considerable portion of the assemblage had resorted, to enjoy the comparatively cool, air, perfumed by the fragrant flowers of the tropics.</p> 
               <p>'Thou wilt confess, dear Marquis,' remarked the Governor, continuing the subject upon which they were conversing, 'that even the gay salons of Madrid, rarely furnish more beauty than is to be seen here to-night.'</p> 
               <p>'The damsels of this fair isle are indeed beautiful to behold, as I must confess to your excellency, 'but it becometh me not to be so discourteous as to disparage the fair ones of our own dear Madrid by making any comparisons.'</p> 
               <p>'Thou speakest like a true, loyal courtier,<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6943-00000013"/> my dear Marquis; 'but, continued Gonzala, espying a mask in a purple domino, 'there's a lady now, if thou couldst but see her face, thou wouldst swear that a more lovely one thine eyes never feasted upon, and yet she is but a Creole.'</p> 
               <p>'A Creole?' repeated Villefana; 'your excellency is not so particular in inviting guests as our nobles are; and yet I have heard that the Governor-General of Cuba was distinguished for his select company.'</p> 
               <p>'Ah, but she's such a glorious exception to her class,' replied Gonzala; 'why any of our gallants would feel himself highly flattered to gain her good graces, or even an approving smile from her sweet lips. She's the daughter of a very respectable, planter, who possesseth a princely fortune, and this lady is the only child, and of course will some day come into possession of all he hath. Excuse me, my dear Marquis, for a brief period; I must show my loyalty to this paragon of beauty, and I may add, this pearl of great price; I will rejoin thee presently.'</p> 
               <p>'Your excellency need make no apology,' replied the Marquis.</p> 
               <p>Gonzala bowed, and was soon beside the lady he had so much extolled, and they were soon lost in the labyrinthine walks of the gardens.</p> 
               <p>'I will follow thee,' said Villefana to himself, 'and watch thee as closely as ever a jealous lover watched his rival.'</p> 
               <p>His Excellency and his well-masked companion, after sauntering about the grounds for some time, they entered and seated themselves in a flower-embowered arbor. They were engaged in such earnest conversation that they did not notice the sound of the rustling of leaves, nor were they every syllable of their conversation was overhead.</p> 
               <p>It was not, as one would have readily supposed, a tender subject, which engrossed the attention of his excellency and the mask, as a portion of the words that passed between them will disclose.</p> 
               <p>'The funds must be forthcoming at all hazards,' said Gonzala; 'if thy father cannot supply the full amount, he must greatly assist me in making up the sum. He shall have ample security.'</p> 
               <p>'Si, your excellency; ample security, of course; he will not doubt the security,' replied the lady; 'but the confidently expected, ere this, that you would repay him at least a small portion of the large sums which you are now overdue, and even the usury on the last half year remains unpaid.'</p> 
               <p>'But hath the he not ample security?' ejaculated the governor.</p> 
               <p>'There can be no disputing that, your excellency,' answered the mask; 'but my father hath use for ready money, and he learned that you had received, or were very soon to receive a large sum from the rich outlaw, Don Fernando de Azvedo, to whom you sent Pedrazza to negotiate.'</p> 
               <p>'Ah! how knowest thou of that, Clarina?' demanded Gonzala.</p> 
               <p>'The manner of my learning your secrets, must remain a secret with me,' replied the lady; 'but, Governor, tell me what success with the famed Smuggler?'</p> 
               <p>'All, I assure you, has thus far failed in that quarter-worse than failed,' replied the Governor. 'The whole affair, instead of being profitable, has proved truly humiliating. This bold Smuggler King, as he is styled, not only sets at defiance all my authority, but even scouts my proposal to grant him a pardon in lieu of his wealth. By extending to him, as he presumptuously demands, an unconditional pardon, his immense wealth and the influence to be gained thereby, I shall be completely at his mercy, He is a bold, cunning fellow, and notwithstanding I have set a thousand snares to entrap him, he eludes them all. I should like to meet him face to face, and if we could not come to terms, to measure rapiers with him.'</p> 
               <p>'Methinks thou wouldst find in him more than a match.'</p> 
                
               <p>'No danger of that,' resumed Gonzala; 'for I was accounted the most expert swords man in all Spain, and I have, lost none of my skill in wielding the weapon since I have governed this island, But, there is no danger of his daring to beard the lion in his den. Now, what is to be done, Clarina? If the funds required be not soon forthcoming, I shall be disgraced here and at home. This Marquis has arrived here at an inopportune time, for he has brought demands from the court of exchequer for the immense sums due the home government; if I am longer delinquent, my ruin is inevitable.'</p> 
               <p>The Marquis Villefana is reported to be immensely rich as well as the outlaw,' said the lady, suggestively.</p> 
               <p>'True; but should I attempt to make a loan of him, he will at once suspect my great financial embarassment.'</p> 
               <p>'Your excellency is not wont to be so dull of comprehension,' said Clarina.</p> 
               <p>'What mean you?'</p> 
               <p>'WIN, not borrow from the Marquis' well-filled coffers!'</p> 
               <p>'By San Pedro, a lucky suggestion, Clarina,' replied the desponding governor, suddenly brightening. 'The very thing; he shall be enticed to play, and if he do but venture to make but the first throw of the dice, I'll shear him of a good share of his golden fleece. He shall be tried this very night-I'll seek him at once, for I promised to rejoin him soon. Let not the Marquis see thy face, Clarina, for I have deceived him in one particular in regard to thee.'</p> 
               <p>'Prithee in what?'</p> 
               <p>'I dare not tell thee now; another time, and thou shalt know all.'</p> 
               <p>'With this promise the Marquis emerged from the bower, and hastened towards the verandah, where he had last left his illustrious guest.</p> 
               <p>Clarina, as the governor had called her, also came forth from the verandah, and was following the footsteps of Gonzala, when a hand touched her lightly upon the shoulder. She turned and beheld a majestic form standing before her.</p> 
               <p>'Buenos noches, Senorita,' said the stranger.</p> 
               <p>'A fair evening to the most noble Marquis Villefana, if I mistake not his goodly person,' said the lady; 'His Excellency, the Governor-General, is seeking for thee.'</p> 
               <p>'He should not be so ungallant as to desire to draw me away from one whose beauty I have heard so much extolled.'</p> 
               <p>'To that beauty it may be his desire to introduce thee,' said the lady.</p> 
               <p>'He doth little compliment his guest, by assuming that he is incompetent to discriminate for himself,' replied the marquis. 'Lady, I would not be rude, but by this bright light, I must behold those sparkling eyes of thine.'</p> 
               <p>Ere the lady could prevent his rudeness, the Marquis snatched the mask from her face, and revealed, not the features of a young and beautiful person, but those of one who might, at some quite remote date, have done considerable execution among the hearts of the Cuban gallants, Fifty summers, at least, had passed over her head. Her eyes were still keen, but her cheeks were sunken, her forehead wrinkled, her hair slightly grey, her teeth discolored, and not a single tint of rosy freshness in her whole countenance.</p> 
               <p>'By the holy Virgin, Marquis,' said she slightly offended, 'thou hast done a most ungallant act; and had I the pride and beauty this form before thee could once boast of, thy rudeness would have been promptly resented.'</p> 
               <p>'Prithee pardon me,' said the Marquis, humbly, as he gazed upon the mature countenance of one who would have made a very respectable duenna to such a person as the governor described to him. 'By Sand Christoval, lady, if my eyes do not deceive me, thou dost disparage thyself; thou hast yet beauty to boast of.'</p> 
               <p>'Fifteen years ago,' she replied, 'Clarina, the Creole Belle, as she was called, was fool<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6943-00000014"/> enough to listen to flattery; but, Marquis, let me tell thee that she has at length arrived at years of discretion, and can well discriminate between flattery and irony. Man is a deceiver, and if my experience is worth a single maravedi, they who are accounted the most noble are the worst of deceivers.'</p> 
               <p>'How learned you this?' queried the nobleman.</p> 
               <p>'By observation, and by my own sad experience.'</p> 
               <p>'Who is he, that calleth himself noble, hath dared to wrong thee?'</p> 
               <p>'Thy host, Gonzala.'</p> 
               <p>'Beware, lest thou shouldst do his excellency much wrong,' cautioned the Marquis.</p> 
               <p>'Oh, never fear that he can be wronged by the tongue of slander,' replied Clarina, spiritedly; 'for Gonzala is an big a knave as ever this beautiful isle was cursed with; ay, he is a heartless wretch, and may the evil one soon get possession of his vile body, as he hath long had possession of his soul. He is now on the very verge of bankruptcy, and my financial cunning, woman though I am, hath done much towards leading him there. 'Twill be a sweet revenge, Marquis, when he falls. For years, through me, he has made loans of large sums of money, and at such ruinous rates that my aged father, and others <choice>
                     <sic>whe</sic>
                     <corr>who</corr>
                  </choice> make a proper use of their wealth, have been enriched thereby.'</p> 
               <p>'But why reveal these things to one who may not feel compelled to keep thy revelations from his ear?'</p> 
               <p>'Because you shall be convinced by me that Gonzala is no friend to thine.'</p> 
               <p>'These things quite amaze me,' replied the marquis.</p> 
               <p>'Thou shalt be still more amazed,' she continued, 'for thy errand to this isle is known to me, and thou wilt go back empty handed. Notwithstanding the rich streams of gold and silver which flow into the Cuban treasury, it is as empty as Gonzala's soul is of honesty, as thou wilt find when he is calted to account for that portion of the revenues of the island due to old Spain. Fortunate it is, Marquis, that we meet here, for I was about to seek thee out, for the purpose of giving thee a word of caution upon another matter. I advised him to game with thee, and did give him, as he supposed, a pair of loaded dice to use only when the stakes should run high, to make sure of his winning. But he is deceived; I have reserved the winning ones for thee, as thou shalt be convinced on examination; and if thou playest shrewdly with him, I promise that Gonzala shall not be the winner. Use these only when playing for large sums;' and she placed the deceptive dice into the palm of his hand.</p> 
               <p>'I understand and thank thee, too,' replied the Marquis, 'and if, as I most religiously believe, thou dealest fairly with me, thou shalt know enough of his villany to crush him as if he were but a fangless viper.'</p> 
               <p>'Ah, then, some facts touching his villanous administration of affairs have reached the court of Madrid?' said the lady, enquiringly.</p> 
               <p>'Much more than his excellency is aware of,' replied the Marquis; 'but thou shalt know more hereafter. I am all impatient to give Gonzala the opportunity he seeks of mending his broken fortunes from my coffers. Ah, ha we shall have rare sport. To-morrow, if thou wouldst have another interview with the Marquis Villefana, seek him at his lodgings in--'</p> 
               <p>'Your address is well known to me,' interrupted Clarina; 'and as I shall desire to learn the result of this night's work, I shall do myself the pleasure to accept the invitation.'</p> 
               <p>A group of guests were now approaching, and the Marquis and the strange woman separated, she to mingle with the gay throng, and he to find Gonzala, whom he soon afterward met.</p> 
               <p>'My dear Marquis,' said the Governor, 'I have been looking all over the palace for thee; I began to fear, lest that some one of our fair fascinating guests had flown with thee from the garden.'</p> 
               <p>'Nay, your excellency,' replied Villefana, at our time of life it becometh us to have done with love-intriguing.'</p> 
               <p>'Your highness would not think so if thou shouldst long dwell beneath these sunny skies. The life-blood here doth course more warmly and freely through the veins of old as well as young than in the old country-But I apprehend, Marquis, thou dost not enjoy the freedom and laxity of our people. The sexes here are not so shy and reserved towards each other as in most other portions of the civilized world.'</p> 
               <p>'So I have observed,' replied Villefana, gravely.</p> 
               <p>'I regret, Marquis, that our sports do not afford thee greater pleasure,' said Gonzala; 'the hours, perhaps, would pass more pleasantly to try the goddess of fortune; a throw or two of the dice would at least vary our festivities. Many of our guests are already amusing themselves with the fickle jade.'</p> 
               <p>'I am worse than ordinary tyros in gaming.</p> 
               <p>'I cannot boast of being any thing more proficient; and as we never make a practice of playing for large sums it is quite unnecessary. Shall we play, Marquis?'</p> 
               <p>'Not here, to be observed by the guests,' replied Villefana. 'Since gaming has become quite unfashionable in the Madrid salons, those who play go apart from the company.'</p> 
               <p>'I was about to suggest that we withdraw into to a private room, where we can enjoy the sport alone.'</p> 
               <p>'Then I am pleased to join you,' said Villefana, taking the Governor-General's arm.</p> 
               <p>They ascended one flight of stairs, and entered a suite of private apartments, the far-their one of which containued the usual conveniences for gambling, a practice, which the governor, in spite of his assertion to the contrary, was as noted for as any one in the island. Whisperings, too, had been heard that he sometimes played falsely, but there were none so bold who dared to charge him openly with it.</p> 
               <p>Cigars and wine, of the choicest brands, were brought in by a negro servant, who, having been dismissed, the noble gentlemen sat down to play. The progress of the many games which were played will require too much space to detail. Let it suffice to say, that, for the first hour, neither party could boast of any marked success, but if they had reckoned up their respective losses and gains, it would have been found that Gonzala had the advantage by a considerable sum.</p> 
               <p>A brief pause was now had; they replenished their glasses, lighted fresh cigars, and chatted quite merrily upon various topics, without any allusion to their sport. They soon recommenced playing, and as they were now somewhat excited by the wine-the Marquis apparently most so, but actually the most cool,-Gonzala proposed to increase the stakes.</p> 
               <p>'With all my heart, old fellow,' acquiesced Villefana, putting on a free and easy air.-'Ay, double and treble 'em if it's all the same to your excellency. What's the use of having a little sport, when it can be doubled, trebled and quadrupled, eh, governor?'</p> 
               <p>'We agree precisely, my dear Villefana,' said Gonzala, who, in rather a clumsy manner substituted a pair of dice for those with which he had been playing. This little circumstance did not fail to escape the observation of the more cunning Marquis, who had accomplished the same thing with a dexterity which would have defied the detection of the keenest pair of eyes.</p> 
               <p>The stakes grew larger and larger, the Governor throwing his new dice every time, without improving his bank, while his antagonist changed his at pleasure, yet winning whenever he deemed it judicious so to do. Not a long time elapsed, after Gonzala had commenced practising his new system of tactics, that his bank was broken-his last rouleau<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6943-00000015"/> leau of doubloons had gone to swell the doubly increased pile of his antagonist.</p> 
               <p>'You have conquered, Marquis,' said Gonzala.</p> 
               <p>'Yes, old fellow,' said Villefana, with easy familiarity. 'But thou shalt have revenge, if it be thy wish.'</p> 
               <p>'Then I shall be compelled to become a borrower,' said Gonzala, suggestively.</p> 
               <p>'Oh, no; pen, ink, and a few slips of paper, will make all right,' said Villefana, carelessly. The autographs of Gonzala are as current as the golden medallions of his majesty.'</p> 
               <p>Gonzala tinkled a small silver bell, a servant appeared, and receiving is master's order he vanished, but soon reappeared with the necessary stationery for the manufacture of 'promises to pay.' These now composed his excellency's bank, but in the most unaccountable manner, whenever one of a small denomination was played for, his excellency was almost invariably the winner, but whenever they represented a large sum, they were sure to alight on the Marquis's side of the table.</p> 
               <p>They had gone on somewhat in this way for three or four hours, when the Governor desired to know the total amount of his losses. The coin and memorandums were computed, and it was found that sixty thousand dollars had changed from the Governor's hands into those of his guest.</p> 
               <p>'Let us play no more,' said Villefana.</p> 
               <p>'By San Pedro! if thou givest me not an opportunity to win back my money, thou hast nearly ruined me! replied Gonzala, becoming desperate. 'Double the stakes!'</p> 
               <p>The Marquis acquiesced, and the result made him a debtor in the sum of sixty thousand more.</p> 
               <p>'Damnation! I have lost again!' exclaimed the loser, stamping his feet with desperation. 'Once more, Marquis, we'll double the stakes.'</p> 
               <p>'Such high playing we never indulge in at home,' remarked Vilefana.</p> 
               <p>'If thou art really a tyro in gaming, either a devil or a saint guides thine almost every throw. Come, my dear Marquis, one more cast!'</p> 
               <p>'Shall it be the last?'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, the very last!'</p> 
               <p>'Then, for the last time, throw away! Remember, I shall not play again.'</p> 
               <p>Gonzala thrice cast the dice upon the table, and obtained a high figure, but Villefana's charmed dice prevailed, and he won the victory!'</p> 
               <p>'Hell and furies! this is ruinous! exclaimed Gonzala, leaping from his chair like a madman, and throwing the dice furiously upon the table. He paced the room to and for; then retiring to an open casement, he permitted the cool sea breeze to fan his feverish brow.</p> 
               <p>The Marquis dexterously changed the dice with which the governor had been playing for those which Clarina had given him, and then rose from his seat, and signified to his host that he must retire.</p> 
               <p>'Stay, Marquis,' said Gonzala, suddenly turning round, his eyes flashing with rage; 'and,' as if a suspicion of foul play flashed suddenly across his brain, he said,-</p> 
               <p>'Fain would I believe that thou didst play with me fairly?'</p> 
               <p>'Dost suspect my honesty?' asked Villefana.</p> 
               <p>'I would not; and yet methinks those dice of thine were marvellously fortunate.</p> 
               <p>'Truly, fortune has turned wonderfully in my favor,' coolly replied Villefana; 'and yet in these little square bits of ivory,' he continued, placing those he now held in his hand into that of the governor. 'Examine these closely at thy leisure, and if thou shouldst discover anything peculiar in them, it will be more than I have observed; and now, governor, permit me to bid thee a very good morning, as by my watch it is already three o'clock, and by the comparative silence which reigns throughout the palace, your guests must have gone, and perhaps my followers, tired, of waiting, have also departed. Adios, excellenza.'</p> 
               <p>With this parting salutation, the Marquis gathered up his treasured and took his leave of the unhappy governor. As he traversed through the apartments below, he found them, as he supposed, quite deserted; but his suite still awaited his coming, and they retired form the palace together.</p> 
               <p>'Accursed be the fortunes of this night!' exclaimed the Governor, striking his forehead, despairingly. 'Now am I irretrievably rained! Never did dice so deceive a gamester!' he continued, examining those which the Marquis had placed in his hand, and casting them upon the table. 'Five, deuce; there is nothing remarkable in that throw.'</p> 
               <p>He picked them up and cast them as before.</p> 
               <p>'Ace, deuce,' said he; 'nor in that either.' Again he submitted them to the test.</p> 
               <p>'Five, four; these are honest dice; 'twas miraculous that they should so frequently turn up sixes, while in the Marquis's hands.'</p> 
               <p>Then picking up those which he supposed he had been playing with during a portion of the evening, and shaking them in the box, turned up sixes. Thrice did he respect the same operation, and thrice did the highest numbers appear.</p> 
               <p>'Diablo!' he muttered; 'had they served me thus, when nearly a quarter of million of dollars were at stake, I might have breathed freely again. But, something must be done, desperate though it be, to repair my broken fortunes, and that too quickly, or I am lost forever!'</p> 
               <p>'Ha, ha, ha! laughed out a shrill, shrieking voice, which broke startlingly upon Gonzala's ear, as if in mockery of his misery-'Ha, ha, ha! lost, forever-lost-lost--'</p> 
               <p>The awful foreboding gradually died away, until a solemn silence pervaded in and about the palace.</p> 
               <p>The wretched man ran to the window and looked forth, but nothing unusual was visible. He closed the casement, and looked about the apartment, and into the adjoining ones, but nothing strange was discovered-He returned, and threw himself upon a lounge, vainly striving to convince himself that what he had heard was but a phantasy of his distempered imagination!</p>

               </p> 
               <p>THE evening succeeding the one on which the Governor-General's masquerade came off, a crew of sailors-as jolly a party of Neptune's boys as ever had a run ashore after a six month's cruise-had commenced a night of merriment at a noted ball, situated in a populous street in the less refined parts of the city. A ball, or 'sailor's shindy,' as it was termed, was the grand attraction, and every one who 'tipped' a Spanish half,' was admitted without further ceremony, whether he wore the habiliments of a grandee, a sailor, or a priest. Those of the fairer sex, however, were admitted by allowing the dance-room under false colors.</p> 
               <p>The jolly crew of tars soon mingled themselves among the already motley assemblage, and joined them in their various sports. Dancing, singing, drinking, and making love to the pretty Creole girls, was the order<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6943-00000016"/> of the evening. Gathered before the bar, in near proximity to a huge bowl of punch, on one end, was a knot of seamen, engaged in imbibing frequent potations of liquor, and conversing rather familiarly of liquor, and conversing rather familiarly of the character of Cubans generally, and of the girls most especially. One of this knot of tars was a stalwart, burly fellow, with a grizzy looking physiognomy, a voice as deep and rough as a bear's, and, altogether, as savage a looking specimen of humanity as one would fall in with among a thousand of the hardy adventurers of the ocean.</p> 
               <p>'Avast, there, shipmates!' he cried; 'just stop overhauling your jaw-tackle about these little frigates sailing under our lee here, under such bright colors. If you want to run athwart their hawse, any one of ye, why do it ship-shape, and man-fashion, and not be tacking, and luffing and wearing-away after the fashion of these land-lubbers. Come, bear a hand here,' he continued, 'let's splice the main-brace all 'round again, and then we'll show these islanders how to come the double-shuffle, the pigeon-wing and the shivering flip-flaps, after the style of the Yankee boys at Orleans!'</p> 
               <p>The main-brace having been duly spliced, they each sought out a partner, commanded the musicians to strike up "The Devil's Dream,' and such another merry dance was never seen in Havana.</p> 
               <p>'W-h-e-w! that's what I call a reg'lar squall from all points of the compass at once,' said the big sailor, fanning himself with a palm-leaf, and wiping his brow with a dingy bandanna, after the dance. "Helloa! shipmates! all hands to quarters once more!-a gale like that parches one's throat more than a calm on the 'quator.'</p> 
               <p>'Marquis!' said a quiet voice from beneath the veil of a lady, who had glided quickly towards him; 'you had better throw off that disguise, for you are now represented as being a very different character from that you are now assuming, or that of the Marquis Villefana. The minions of Gonzala are watching you, and will, be assured, arrest you.'</p> 
               <p>'Thanks, lady, whoever you may be!' said the other, in a whisper.</p> 
               <p>'Those little bits of ivory served you well, last night,' said she.</p> 
               <p>'Ah, Clarina, is it you?'</p> 
               <p>'Enough-beware!'</p> 
               <p>'Fear not-I am on my guard!'</p> 
               <p>`'Tis well,' said she, and glided away as suddenly as she had appeared.</p> 
               <p>'Heave ahead here, Jack-we're lying to for you in Punch Bay!' cried out one of his comrades.</p> 
               <p>'Ay, ay, sir,' said Jack, sailing alongside his messmates, who had their glasses already filled. 'A long drink, my covey; this shaking foot ashore makes a man more thirty than reefing topsails in a gale of wind. Now for a toast, boys! Here's to the most honest man in all Havana!'</p> 
               <p>'His Excellency, the Governor-General!' cried a voice from among a group of men and women.</p> 
               <p>'Do you call old Gonzala the most honest man in all Havana?' demanded Jack.</p> 
               <p>'Whether he is or no, 'twill be unsafe to say that he is not!' answered the governor's advocate.</p> 
               <p>'What slave is he so cowardly as not to speak his mind?'</p> 
               <p>'I am no slave,' said a tall fellow, in a cowl and cassock, stepping forth; 'but I am one who says that he is in danger, who dares to speak ill of his excellency!'</p> 
               <p>'His excellency be d---d, for being as great <choice>
                     <sic>sconndrel</sic>
                     <corr>scoundrel</corr>
                  </choice> as yourself, or any other vile monk!'</p> 
               <p>'This is treason!' said the monk.</p> 
               <p>'When you get to your cell put it into your pipe and smoke it,' returned the plain-speaking tar.</p> 
               <p>'Stand, fellow!' said he of the cowl and cassock, throwing off his monkish garments, and revealing the chief of the foot police of Havana, and at a signal, some twelve or fifteen of his colleagues, suddenly made their appearance, armed with swords and pistols. 'Arrest than man! You're my prisoner!'</p> 
               <p>'No, I'm d--d if I am,' said Jack, keeping up his character, and taking a huge quid of tobacco from his jaw, and causing it suddenly to lodge directly between the eyes of the chief official. 'Square away, boys!-we'll teach these sneaking, cutthroat rascals that there is danger in undertaking to run down an honest cruiser!'</p> 
               <p>The Police, with swords in hands, made a desperate dash in among those who stood firmly around their leader, but, instead of encountering fists, the usual weapon of a sailor, they found themselves opposed by as many heavy sabres, wielded by hands more skilled in using the weapons than they.</p> 
               <p>The result was that the policemen were readily disarmed, and the whole assemblage was in a great state of terror and confusion! the lights were extinguished and a general stampede took place, the assailants among the number, while the jovial party, who had so signally discomfited them, made their retreat by a small door, leading to a street in the rear.</p> 
               <p>'Now, boys, to the carriages!' said the big sailor, as they reached the outside; 'we must be speedy, or we shall have such a pack of Gonzala's bounds about us, that we may not be so successful in coping with them.'</p> 
               <p>They pursued their way towards four carriages, driven by servants in livery. A footman stood at the door of each, and having taken up the whole party, they were quickly rattling over the pavements towards a more aristocratic section of the city.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, as had been predicted, a large body of armed men, were quickly summoned to the aid of the beaten police, but their game had flown, whither no one could tell, for no one knew among the crowd who came so unceremoniously forth from the gayscene. Then commenced a strict search, which was continued throughout the night.</p> 
               <p>But let us follow the heroes of the sudden row. The carriages, after threading several streets, stopped before the hotel, temporarily occupied by the Marquis Villefana, and when their occupants alighted, they appeared like very different personages from those who had entered them; in fact, during the ride, they had become most miraculously metamorphosed into so many finely dressed gentlemen; the Marquis himself, who had enacted the part of the leader of the sailors, being among the number.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely had Villefana and his followers alighted, when another carriage, with driver and footmen in livery, drove up, and his excellency, the governor, alighted, and walked up the steps of the hotel, where the Marquis and his suite tarried to receive him.</p> 
               <p>'Ah! your excellency! this is truly an unexpected and agreeable surprise,' said the Marquis, extending his hand and giving him a cordial welcome. 'Walk in! thou lookest excited; 'What's afloat, governor?'</p> 
               <p>'Ah! my dear Marquis! glorious news!' exclaimed Gonzala, almost breathless with excitement. 'We've trapped him at last! Once in my power, and by the ten Virgins, it shall go hard with him!'</p> 
               <p>'To what or whom does your excellency allude?' asked the Marquis.</p> 
               <p>'The whole city is in a state of commotion.'</p> 
               <p>"Is it? indeed, we had not perceived it, said the Marquis; 'and my friends and myself have but this minute returned from a drive through the most populous parts of the city; but what, your excellency, is all this <choice>
                     <sic>exitement</sic>

               <p>'We have trapped him!'</p> 
               <p>'Who? what?'</p> 
               <p>The governor stared with an incredulous expression into the nobleman's countenance, and said,</p> 
               <p>'Why, to whom can I allude, but to the daring outlaw, Don Fernando de Azvedo whose name to-night is in the mouths of all the people of Havana?'</p> 
               <p>'Don Fernando de Azvedo?' repeated the<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6943-00000017"/> Marquis, musingly; 'yes, methinks I have heard that name mentioned somewhere.'</p> 
               <p>To be sure thou hast, Marquis,' resumed Gonzalo. 'I mean Azvedo, the great contrabandist-called by his followers the Smuggler King! The name of this noted character is certainly Known throughout Spain-I know that he is!'</p> 
               <p>'Indeed! oh! ah! yes, I think his name is frequently mentioned there. A romantic character, isn't he?'</p> 
               <p>'Yes; a second Hernani!'</p> 
               <p>'Full of adventures, eh?'</p> 
               <p>'A perfect Rinaldo Rinaldini!'</p> 
               <p>'Courageous as a lion?'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, another Boabdil.'</p> 
               <p>'Bloody, too, I suppose?'</p> 
               <p>In that particular, a second Blackbeard!' replied the governor. 'Why, my dear Marquis, he's such a terrible fellow, I shall regard it as one of the greatest achievements of my life, to get him securely within one of the castle dungeons. He has cost the government a mint of money, already.'</p> 
               <p>'Oh! but I thought that thou wert rejoicing over his capture,' remarked Villefana; 'it appears, then, that he is not quite yet in your custody?'</p> 
               <p>'No, yes; that is, he's good as caught,' replied Gonzala. 'It is most wonderful to relate; but if you'll believe me, Marquis, the fellow has even dared to risk his person in the very city of Havana, where he was formerly so well known. He has been, this very evening, actually seen, by those who know him well, among a party of sailors, himself disguised as one of them; and he is now at a Creole ball in a low part of the city, if the detachment of police which I have sent thither, has not already seized him.'</p> 
               <p>'The policemen may be outwitted by this cunning outlaw,' suggested the Marquis.</p> 
               <p>'No; they cannot fail to succeed, for each one of them has an accurate description of him.'</p> 
               <p>'In person, governor, what manner of man is he?'</p> 
               <p>'He assumes so many shapes that it were difficult to describe him.'</p> 
               <p>'But he cannot change his weight or stature at pleasure?' said Villefana.</p> 
               <p>'Tn weight,' replied Gonzala, he cannot fall much short of two hundred and fifty pounds; in stature, almost a giant; he will exceed even your great height, by three inch as at least; and as fur muscular strength, it is said, that no man of modern days rivals him. Moreover, he is an exceedingly uncouth and rough looking individual, and very bearish in his manners.'</p> 
               <p>A savage description truly,' said Villefana, 'I am sure the efficient police will not fail to recognize, arrest, and bring him to justice.'</p> 
               <p>'Undoubtedly; I cannot see how it is possible for him to elude their vigilance, notwithstanding he is such a slippery fellow' He is as good as in prison now, for I have given orders to have every avenue of egress from the city strictly guarded. My visit here to-night is solely to communicate to you, the glorious intelligence, and have left a message for the chief of police to seek me here, as soon as he had got the outlaw safely within the walls of the strongest dungeon of the castle.'</p> 
               <p>'And what are thy intentions with regard to this terribly dangerous fellow?' asked the Marquis.</p> 
               <p>'Feast the eyes of all Cuba upon a spectacle which they will never be likely to forget; strangle him with the, garotte!'</p> 
               <p>An appalling death to suffer, truly; fend' I learn that the Cubans are frequently regaled with such spectacles?' remarked Villefana;</p> 
               <p>Yes, Marquis, we do have frequent executions of miserable, low criminals; but this Will be a great and glorious one, and will afford more sport to the populace than a dozen ordinary exhibitions of strangling,' said Gonzala, his eyes sparkling with fiendish lustre.</p> 
               <p>'Dost say the Cubans delight in stick horrible rible spectacles? My very soul sickens at the thought.'</p> 
               <p>'Next to a Bull-Fight, my dear Marquis the people are delighted to behold our skilful executioner turn the fatal machine; and to speak the truth, they love me all the better for giving them frequent opportunities of witnessing. this rare mode of sending the wretched culprits out of the world, and I gratify them as often as it is possible.'</p> 
               <p>'It is said, governor, that many innocent men have become victims to this infernal instrument of death,' gravely remarked Villefana.</p> 
               <p>'Possibly, possibly, my deer Marquis,' replied Gonzala, with an air of total indifference; 'but nineteen out of twenty are guilty, I do assure thee.'</p> 
               <p>'We read in the good book that it is better that many sinners go unpunished, than that one innocent man should suffer. Is it not so, governor?'</p> 
               <p>'That kind of doctrine will do to hold up in the old country,' replied Gonzala; 'but to preserve law and order, and power, among the hetrogeneous population of these islands, we cannot be so particular as to be guided by any musty rules of proverbs. He who would rule here must do it with an iron hand, and an unrelenting soul. At all events, on the score of presumed innocence, there will be no danger in a summary execution of the renowned Smuggler King, even without the formula of an examination, for there are a thousand men in the isle who would testify to his guilt.'</p> 
               <p>'Of what crimes is this outlaw guilty?' asked Villefana.</p> 
               <p>'Chiefly of smuggling; though it is very strongly and reasonably suspected that he does not scruple to enact the part of a chief of Buccaneers, whenever the contraband business does not bring a good supply of gold to his coffers.'</p> 
               <p>' You certainly would out punish him as a Pirate, on either suspicion or presumption? said Villefana.</p> 
               <p>'It would not be essential,' answered Gonzala. 'The laws of Spain, for the government of her isles, punish the contrabandis with death!'</p> 
               <p>'But not without the ceremony of a trial, remarked the Marquis.</p> 
               <p>'Pardon me; but the king hath ordered several executions for the crime of smuggling without trial.'</p> 
               <p>'The king, your excellency is well aware may do what the subject may not.'</p> 
               <p>'I grant ye; but in the exercise of my prerogative, as sovereign of this isle, have not the authority of a monarch?'</p> 
               <p>'Your excellency will pardon me, if I press my opinion that thou has not,' reple Villefana. "For instance, the king hath power to pardon for capital offences. Hast thou such power?'</p> 
               <p>'In that particular, I grant you, I have if not.'</p> 
               <p>'On the same principle, permit me to and thou hast not the power to condemn without a trial, unless it be by a special dispensation from the crown.'</p> 
               <p>'If that be the opinion of the noble Marquis Villefafa,' acquiesced Gonzala, 'I shall hereafter act in accordance with that opinion: but my views on that point had been different.</p> 
               <p>The conversation was here interrupted by the announcement that a servant of his excellency had arrived, bearing a message for his excellency.</p> 
               <p>'With your permission, Marquis,' said the governor, the messenger may come before; us. for he undoubtedly beareth news; that we shall both be pleased to hear.'</p> 
               <p>The Marquis cheerfully <choice>

                     <corr>acquiesced</corr>
                  </choice>, and mulatto, a favorite servant of Gonzala, was brought before them.</p> 
               <p>Well, Zango, have they arrested the out law?'asked the governor.</p> 
               <p>'No, massa gubnor,' replied the slave; new get him yet; and dem aint de wuss ob it, dey can't cotch him police no find him nowhere;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6943-00000018"/> he hab wanish like de fog fore de sun; he lebil fellow keep out de way, massa.'</p> 
               <p>'Maledicite!' exclaimed Gonzala; 'how learned you all this Zango?'</p> 
               <p>'From Massa Narbil, capen ob police', replied Zango; 'dey hab gran fight-forty sailor men all cubered wid pistols and swords; knock down one, two, tree, four, six, ten police-police cotch fibe sailor men-de earth, sum say up in de clouds, oders rund away faster dan race-hoss, and sum jumpt in de sea, and swim off to a smuggle vessel.'</p> 
               <p>'Where is Narville, chief of the police?' asked the governor.</p> 
               <p>'At de palise, massa gubnor,' answered Zango; 'he send me ober here to tellee you wot a fite dey hab cotchin' him, and wen dey sure dey got him sartin, dey no cotch him at all.'</p> 
               <p>'Hasten back to the palace, and send the chief here at once. Be speedy, Zango.'</p> 
               <p>'Ees, massa gubnor and turning on his heel he suddenly made his exit.</p> 
               <p>Some thirty minutes elapsed, when the redoubtable coptain of the police, Don Enrico Narville made his appearance; he was the dentinal individual who had led the policemen in their attack on the disguised Marquis and his followers at the Creole masquerade. He was ushered in and introduced to the nobleman and his suite by the governor.</p> 
               <p>'Narville,' said Gonzala; 'I am very much inclined to be angry with thee. Thou hast let the daring outlaw escape, I hear, notwithstanding all the precautionary arrangements we had made.</p> 
               <p>'It is true your excellency,' replied Narville; 'he has slipped through my fingers as he did through Pedrazza's at the time I ordered his arrest, some fifty armed desperadoes suddenly came to his rescue! Yet, we stood our ground, and battled hem as long we could; and although our immediate available force did not exceed a dozen men, we met with no loss, but succeeded in taking prisoners five of his ferocious followers!'</p> 
               <p>'By the mass, there is comfort in that!' ejaculated the governor.</p> 
               <p>'Art sure they are the Smuggler's men whom thou hast in custody?' enquired Villefana.</p> 
               <p>On your highness, there cannot be a reasonable doubt of it,' replied the officer.</p> 
               <p>'By San Diego! but they shall be put to the torture, if they do not readily divulge all the information they possess in regard to the outlaw!' said Gonzala, with an air of triumph.</p> 
               <p>'To the torture?' repeated the Marquis; 'I hope, for the sake of humanity, the inquisition hath not been established in this isle?'</p> 
               <p>'To the torture?' repeated the Marquis; 'I hope, for the sake of humanity, the inquisition hath not been established in this isle?'</p> 
               <p>'We may differ,' remarked Gonzala, 'as to the usefulness of the institution named, but my experience and observation have led me to regard it favorably, not only for punishing the guilty, but for the protection of the innocent, Of course such a power ought not to be placed in any but discreet hands. But tell me, Narville,' continued the governor, waiving this new topic of conversation, 'did you actually meet the bold smuggler face to face?'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, your excellency,' replied the officer; 'dearer than I am to you this moment; our blades crossed, and had not one of his cutthroat desperadoes, with heavy sabre in his hand, rushed between us, my good sword would have cheated the garotte of its due, and the people the pleasure of witnessing his execution!'</p> 
               <p>'He is a very powerful man, I am informed, and a very expert swordsman, too?' said the Marquis, enquiringly.</p> 
               <p>'Yes, your highness; an exceedingly muscular man; much taller and stouter than yourself-pardon the comparison; and as for his dexterity with the sword, I never crossed blades with one more skilful.'</p> 
               <p>'It seemeth almost incredible,' continued Villefana,' that this outlaw should have fifty followers, readily armed, to come to the rescue, in such a place.'</p> 
               <p>'Fifty there were at least,' persisted Narville, 'upon the honor of a Castilian.'</p> 
               <p>'And how many, sayst thou, to oppose this force?'</p> 
               <p>'Not more than twelve.'</p> 
               <p>'It is hardly a matter of wonder then, that the rogue slipped so easily through thy hands,' remarked Villefana. 'Why, this outlaw, governor, whom you regard with so much dread, if you do not put a stop to his strange career, will yet create a revolution in thy very midst. If he hath the power to summon fifty men to his aid at a moment's warning, in thy very city, he will at no distant day be found to be a formidable rival to thee, governor, for thy place!'</p> 
               <p>'Rely upon it, my dear Marquis, we shall have him yet, and very soon, too,' said Gonzala; 'the avenus to and from the city, so well guarded, render it quite impossible for him to escape. 'Narvile,' he continued, turning to the officer, 'hast seen to the execution of all my orders?'</p> 
               <p>'So far s possible,' replied Narville; 'I had not opportunity for sending to the officer at the Moro, and concluded to dely it untill I had communicated the result of our arrack on the Smuggler.'</p> 
               <p>'Then, depart ar once and see to it,' commanded Gonzala; 'the guards must be doubled to-night.'</p> 
               <p>'your excellencya shall be obeyed,' said the officer, bowing politely, and taking his leave.</p> 
               <p>The Marquis thn intimating that he desired a feew moments private conference with the Governor, the gentlemen of his suite withdraw.</p> 
               <p>'Dost have implicit confidence in Navarre?' asked the marquis.</p> 
               <p>'I hve undoubted confidence in him,' replied Gonzala. 'He's as true steel; but why does your highness ask?'</p> 
               <p>'Because I feel a deep interest in the security and peace of this city,' answered Villefana; 'and I fear it will not long have either if such men as Narville have their keeping.</p> 
               <p>'Indeed!'</p> 
               <p>'I speak only of what I do know,' continued the Marquis. 'He is a liar, a braggart, and a coward! therefore totally unfit for any post of responsibility.</p> 
               <p>'Ah! hast proof of this, that he may punished according to his deserts?' asked the surprised governor.</p> 
               <p>'Ay, as strong as holy writ!'</p> 
               <p>'Wilt show me the evidence?'</p> 
               <p>'Hear me, governor,' said the Marquis 'and if thou art not satisfied with the truth of what I shall state, I will then cause it to be confirmed by other testimoney. In the first place, I charge him with being a liar! At the time of his attempt to arrest this outlaw, he had not less than twenty-five men at his back, and as for the fifty men which came to the Smuggler's rescue, there were not one more than twelve, as I am a Spaniard. Secondly, himself and every one of his men were disarmed by those who came to the rescue of the outlaw, and then they ingloriously fled from the melee, like so many cowards! The truth of his being a braggart is confirmed by what he himself said here in thy presence. Now for the testimony, governor which shall convince thee of what I have declared; marvel not when I reveal to thee the fact, that those gentlemen who have just retired, including myself, are the identical individuals, who discomfited Narville and his force are the Creole masquerade. We were on a foolish frolic, governor and were disguised as sailors! We had just arrived from the scene when the carriage of your excellency drove up, and had removed from our persons the disguise in which we appeared, while riding to our lodgings here. Now, governor, as we are as safely off, without receiving even so much as a scratch from thy valiant policemen, it is lute fair to presume that the five prisoners taken in that bloodless battle, can in no manner be considered guilty. Depend upon it every one of them are innocent of taking sides in<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6943-00000019"/> the affray, unless they rushed to the assistance of Narville's force; and if taken prisoners, they were only seized to satisfy thee that they had performed their duty, and acted like men of courage!'</p> 
               <p>'I am all amazement!' exclaimed the governor, 'that thou should'st thus expose thyself, my dear Marquis. 'Then thou wert, in they disguise, really taken for the Smuggler King!'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, your excellency; and whoever identified me was not mistaken! for I AM THE SMUGGLER KING!'</p>

               <p>ANGER, amazement, fear and confusion were at once depicted upon the countenance of the Governor General Gonzala. Tremblingly he turned his eye upon the <choice>

He, who, but a moment before, had been exulting over the probable capture of the great contrabandist, was himself entrapped into his power; for he felt that he was a prisoner even in the city over which he had so long <choice>

He it was, too, who had but on the previous night lost a fortune at the gaming table, by the matchless skill of the man he most dreaded; the man who had so frequently thwarted his many attempts to get him into his power, not so much, however, for the purpose of maintaining the supremacy of the laws, but for the purpose of gaining possession of the reputed immense treasures of the free-trading monarch of the Antilles.</p> 
               <p>'Gonzala seemeth uneasy to find his dear friend, the Marquis Villefana, so suddenly transformed into the great outcast, the King of the Smugglers?' remarked Azvedo with a smile of complacency upon his lips, and an ironical leer in his large, piercing black eye.</p> 
               <p>'Yes-I confess myself somewhat uneasy-I should say surprised,' essayed Gonzala, the words almost sticking in his throat. 'I never was so deceived-never so imposed upon!'</p> 
               <p>'Honored, never so honored, governor! returned the Smuggler, proudly; 'of my kingdom and throne I cannot boast much, but I can boast of being as good a man as the Marquis de Villefana, whom I have so successfully represented; and, moreover, I can do thee more good than he could possibly have done thee.'</p> 
               <p>'I prithee, what good can I expect from my bitter enemy?' asked Gonzala, reassuring himself, because of the complacent manner of Azvedo.</p> 
               <p>'I can make an honest man of thee, governor; aye, and a charitable one, too.'</p> 
               <p>'By my good sword, I cannot brook these insults!' exclaimed Gonzala, drawing his rapier, and putting himself in an attitude of defence.</p> 
               <p>'Ah!' said the Smuggler, drawing his own sword; 'I like that; it is a long time since I have enjoyed the game of cut and thrust with a noble gentleman, and one, too, who is famed for having carte and fierce 'at his fingers ends.'</p> 
               <p>'Come on!' cried Gonzala, his face livid with rage.</p> 
               <p>The Smuggler advanced-their blades crossed; then looking each other steadily in the eye for a moment, Gonzala threw back Azvedo's sword, and made and feint; the quick eye of his antagonist saw the deceptive attack, and turning it to his own advantage, the rapier of his excellency went whirling to the wall, and was caught in its descent by the left hand of the Smuggler.</p> 
               <p>'This is noble sport, governor; try it again!' said the victor, politely extending the sword of Gonzala towards him.</p> 
               <p>The latter hesitated to take it.</p> 
               <p>'Receive thy weapon, governor; I didn't give thee a fair chance; it was all my fault in putting an end to the sport so soon-one more trial!'</p> 
               <p>'Nay, I'll not fight with the d--'</p> 
               <p>'Tut, tut,' interrupted Azvedo, sportively, 'I claim not the honor of even the slightest acquaintance with that ubiquitous gentleman, whose name had nearly escaped thy tongue. No, governor, I am unfortunately as human as thyself. But take thy rapier, it will serve to protect thee against midnight assassins on thy return home.'</p> 
               <p>Gonzala, encouraged by these words, took the rapier, and, returning it to its sheath, strode towards the door by which he had entered, saying-</p> 
               <p>'My carriage awaiteth me, so I will bid thee a good night.'</p> 
               <p>He reached the door, and found, not much to his surprise, however, that it had been fastened upon the outside!</p> 
               <p>'Nay, governor, I cannot lose the pleasure of thy company so abruptly,' said the Smuggler, apparently not heeding Gonzala's attempt to find his way out. 'Be once more seated-this Hungarian nectar still holds out-Tokay is a rare wine-oh! I forgot to mention that I have caused thy carriage and attendants to be dismissed for the night. Therefore give thyself no uneasiness on account of any alarm that might be felt at the palace on account of they absence, for ere this thy household understands full well that business of pressing importance keeps thee away.'</p> 
               <p>This was uttered with such imperturbable coolness and courteousness, that Gonzala stood amazed and almost speechless before the wonderful man in whose power he felt himself to be. He at length seated himself, and throwing down his plumed beaver, said,</p> 
               <p>'If I understand thee rightly, I am unlawfully detained here as the prisoner of--'</p> 
               <p>'Nay, governor,' interrupted Azvedo, 'thou dost not understand me rightly; my hospitality must not be misconstrued. Thou camest to pay me a visit, and I find thee a much more agreeable guest than I had reasons to expect. It were, I am well assured, the worst of crimes for even a citizen-subject to detain as a prisoner the sovereign of these isles. Therefore, governor, consider thyself the Smuggler's guest, on compulsion if thou wilt have it so, but nothing more I do honestly assure thee. Gaze around; this sumptuously furnished apartment does not look like a place of captivity; it bears a marked contrast with that deep, dark, damp dungeon, which was to be the abode of the 'piratical outcast, until the day of execution, when the populace of this goodly isle was to be feasted with a spectacle almost as attractive and delightful as a Bull-Fight! Look about thee, governor; the windows and doors are surely not barricaded; there are no grim sentinels posted; no hand-dog looking sentinel; nothing indicative of life in prison. Thy food shall not consist of hard crusts and villanous water; but the richest meats, fruits and wines shall be served to my illustrious guest; and, above all the best of good company, the only thing, after all, that makes life pass agreeably; that company will consist of my jovial comrades and thy humble servant, and shall make thy tarry here as agreeable as if thou wert a guest in the palace of his most Christian Majesty, the King of Spain. But, governor, as we have business, it were well for us to sup alone; then if thou hast desire for a night of good cheer, my boon companions, every one of whom deserves to be dubbed Knight of the Golden Fleece, shall rejoin us!'</p> 
               <p>'Yet do I protest against--</p> 
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6943-00000020"/> 
               <p>'Protest not; for, if wise, thou wilt accept my hospitality.'</p> 
               <p>'What if I refuse?'</p> 
               <p>'Refusals I cannot listen to,' replied the Smuggler, taking up a bell from the table, and ringing it smartly.</p> 
               <p>A negro servant's head protruded through one of the doors.</p> 
               <p>'A banquet! a banquet for his excellency!' commanded the outlaw.</p> 
               <p>A few minutes passed away, when some five or six servants appeared, bearing large silver salvers, covered with the most savory comestibles, and the most delicious wines and fruits to be had in the isle. The table was quickly prepared, when the Smuggler invited his 'Compulsory guest' to partake of the tempting banquet.</p> 
               <p>Gonzala having partially overcome his confusion, in being placed in such an embarrassing position, finally came to the conclusion that it were policy to put the best possible face upon the matter, and no longer resist the 'pressing' invitation. He, therefore, drew up to the table, and permitted the extremely attentive servants to wait upon him through the several courses. The wines, and they were of the choicest vintages, flowed so freely, that soon, the most observing stranger would not have discovered for some time but that these two distinguished individuals were otherwise than on the most friendly terms; but on some slight allusion of Azvedo, as to his real character, a new idea appeared suddenly to dawn upon the mind of Gonzala.</p> 
               <p>'Come, come, my dear Marquis,' said he, 'a truce to this nonsense; let's have no more of it; it's too gigantic a joke. Thou, the Marquis Villefana, the Smuggler King! bah! preposterous! Now, shall I strip thee of thy borrowed renegade plumes at a single breath. Ha, ha! Tell me, marquis, if thou art not really what thou first represented thyself to be, how is it that you bore, in Villefana's name, despatches, letters of credit, and clothed with powers form the home government to this isle! By San Cristoval! 'tis a rare joke! I owe thee one, and set me down for a fool if I fail to repay thee!'</p> 
               <p>'Upon my veracity, governor,' replied the Smuggler, gravely, 'I am no more the Marquis Villefana than thou art King Ferdinand the Seventh. I have spoken but the truth, during our very agreeable interview, and in proof of what I have asserted, I must beg of thee to peruse carefully a document which I have in my possession; and if, when read, the evidence is not sufficient to dispel thy incredulity, more and stronger shall be adduced.'</p> 
               <p>The Smuggler hereupon drew from his belt a manuscript. It purported to be the narrative of the voyage of the voyage of Captain Manuel Seranno, in the Spanish galleon, Salamanca, from Lisbon to Havana, with a full account of his being overhauled and attacked by a band of bloody pirates in boats; of the indiscriminate massacre of nearly all the ship's company, including his highness, the Marquis de Villefana and Suite; of the smugglers, under the command of Don Fernando de Azvedo, coming to the rescue just in time to save the captain and two or three of his men; and of the agreement of Captain Serano with the leader of the smugglers, as some recompense for the saving of the galleon and his own life, that he should be taken to Havana, and assume, if he pleased, the name and character of the murdered Marquis, and to take into possession all his effects, until such time as he saw fit to restore them. This narrative was signed by Captain Seranno, and two survivors of the galleon, and sworn to before his excellency's Notary, Don Sebastian de Ferraro, whose autograph Gonzala was perfectly familiar with.</p> 
               <p>The governor perused this startling narrative with great care, his hand trembling in the meantime as if palsied, and for minutes after he had finished reading it, his eyes were fixed abstractedly upon the document, which left but little doubt in his mind as to its authenticity.</p> 
                
               <p>'Your excellency hath read the narrative!' at length remarked Azvedo. 'What sayest thou? is more testimony needed to remove thy incredulity?'</p> 
               <p>'I cannot doubt if I would, and yet 'tis so strange-so,-'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, governor, it is strange, but, nevertheless, true; and stranger things have happened, and may happen again,' said Azvedo.</p> 
               <p>'True, true, true,' repeated Gonzala, with a thoughtful look.</p> 
               <p>'Now, governor, since there is no room for further doubt, let us confer together, and see if we cannot adjust the little difficulties so long existing between us, and which day by day have been increasing.'</p> 
               <p>'I cannot treat with thee under compulsion.'</p> 
               <p>'This is no inquisitorial court, replied the Smuggler; 'compulsory measures are unessential. Thou canst refuse all overtures if I do not offer thee fairly and justly. Wilt listen to the proposal I have to make?'</p> 
               <p>'Proceed.'</p> 
               <p>'By thy unjust decree Don Fernando de Azvedo become an outlaw, and a contrabandist.'</p> 
               <p>'Thou canst not say that any decree of mine made thee a contrabandist.'</p> 
               <p>'Not directly, but indirectly,' replied Azvedo; 'and, again, by another decree of thine up fortune became confiscate and escheated to the government.'</p> 
               <p>'I cannot admit that these acts of mine were illegal or unjust,' remarked Gonzala.</p> 
               <p>'Admit it, but for the moment.'</p> 
               <p>'Well. then, proceed.'</p> 
               <p>'Since those decrees went into effect, thou hast issued several proclamations. offering ten, twenty, and even thirty, and even thirty thousand dollars for my apprehension!'</p> 
               <p>'True.'</p> 
               <p>'Now, governor, annual all thy proscriptive edicts, restore to me my family estates, and the rights of citizenship, and these several pieces of paper, representing more than the value of the estates in their present condition with thy signature attached, shall be cancelled.'</p> 
               <p>'For those notes I have not had value received.'</p> 
               <p>'Oh, yes, governor, thou hadst a glorious night's sport; besides, they read 'for value received,' and in the hands of a third party, less merciful than myself. might occasion thee serious embarrassment; again, it is an honorable debt; the governor-general could not refuse to liquidate a debt of honor?'</p> 
               <p>'Accursed be that night's work!' exclaimed Gonzala; 'is that the only condition?'</p> 
               <p>'It is, perhaps, quite enough to save thee from bankruptcy, and from a disgrace of a lower degree than you have caused me and mine.'</p> 
               <p>'Give me but three days to consider of the matter?' asked Gonzala.</p> 
               <p>'Nay, governor, a decisive answer I must have this very night, and in this very apartment.'</p> 
               <p>'Let me but consult my counsellors?'</p> 
               <p>'That will be useless; they are but thy creatures.'</p> 
               <p>'But, consider; the proposition is so sudden-so unexpected; and my duties to the state require me to be cautions in all affairs of so important a nature.'</p> 
               <p>'Thou carest not the toss of a maravedi for the state!' said the Smuggler. 'Thine own interests. governor, must first be subserved, and if it be for the state's good, why then it is well; if not it would not change thy course of action a jot or a tittle. I have long watched thee, and know dost know thy self.'</p> 
               <p>'All men are governed by their own interests,' replied Gonzala.</p> 
               <p>'Kings, governors, and all in authority, should be exempt from such a damnable stigma,' said the Smuggler; 'but we are wandering from the matter we have in hand. Wilt accept my proposition?'</p> 
               <p>'Hast no other to make?'</p> 
               <p>'None.'</p> 
               <pb n="44-45 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6943-00000021"/> 
               <p>'No variation in the terms?'</p> 
               <p>"Certainly none more favorable.'</p> 
               <p>'I accede only on one condition?'</p> 
               <p>'Let it be reasonable.'</p> 
               <p>'That I shall be detained here no longer against my will.'</p> 
               <p>'I pray thee, governor,' said the Smuggler good-humoredly; 'that thou wilt not for a moment think that we could be so wanting in respect for the governor-general as to force him to remain where he desired not to stay. They condition shall not for a moment be an obstacle to the condition. Thou shalt be sent forthwith to the palace in one of my own carriages, providing our terms are consculed to.'</p> 
               <p>'Well, let it be according to thy demands,' said Gonzala, with considerable show of reluctance, though he would willingly have acceded to anything, verbally, provided he could once get out of the clutches of the Smuggler with a whole skin.'</p> 
               <p>'Here is out agreement, fully set forth,-place but thy signature there, and all is accomplished,' said Azvedo, as he unfolded a document, though previously prepared, yet specifying with exactness what had been agreed upon.</p> 
               <p>Gonzala was again confused; he cast his over the written page, while the little color, which a moment before tinged his cheek, fled, and his countenance was again as palid as when his tormentor first declared himself the Smuggler King!</p> 
               <p>'Upon my honor, Senor,' said Gonzala, with a vain attempt to appear indifferent, 'my signature will be useless-my word is as sacred as my bond.'</p> 
               <p>'Precisely-mere from, your excellency;' said the Smuggler; 'but, on a second thought, it is not quite so sure; indeed, I may say in this imperfect world of ours, it is a very rare thing for a man's word to pass as current as his written pledge. If it were common, governor, here in Havana,' he continued with a quiet but slightly satirical manner, 'for the bankers to give thee loans on thy word, of course it would ill become me to refuse; but as it is not, thy written name will give strength and importance to our somewhat novel negotiation.'</p> 
               <p>Gonzala somewhat reluctantly took the pen, which was almost forced between his fingers by Azvedo and carelessly appended his autograph.</p> 
               <p>'We must have one or more credible witnesses to this agreement,' said Azvedo.</p> 
               <p>'Oh! most certainly! make it strong!' exclaimed Gonzala, with a mock show of satisfaction; 'thou hast friends in the adjoining apartment.'</p> 
               <p>'Ah! yes; but unfortunately they, like myself, have been proscribed, and I fear they might not be deemed credible witnesses; but, luckily, I have it an, my power to call one who, I believe, bears a good name in the city, and is in high repute with your excellency.</p> 
               <p>The Smuggler retired from the apartment, and in a few moments returned with a closely veiled lady leaning upon his arm. Without a word being uttered, she advanced to the table, the document was placed before her, and she took up the pen and signed it.</p> 
               <p>Gonzala looked at the signature-it was that of 'Dona Claribel Lopez.'</p> 
               <p>'Stay, lady!' cried Gonzala, and the he started towards her, but she disappeared much more quickly than she had appeared.</p> 
               <p>'Dona Claribel Lopez hath been dead more than two years!' declared the governor, with an astonished look.</p> 
               <p>'So your excellency hath for more than two years believed,' coolly replied Azvedo 'but lest her signature should be denied, it were well to have another witness, and a second veiled lady was ushered in, and wrote the name of 'Dona Clarina Martinez' to the document which was placed before her to sign.</p> 
               <p>'Clarina, is it thou?' demanded Gonzala, with a bewildered expression.</p> 
               <p>'Si, Senor,' she replied, and without further words she, too, made a hasty exit.</p> 
                
               <p>

               <p>'To what does all this mystery tend?' enquired Gonzalo.</p> 
               <p>'To the redressing of wrongs suffered by the innocent, and to the punishment of the guilty,' answered Azvedo, with emphasis.</p> 
               <p>'Thy answer hath an ambiguous signification,' remarked the governor.</p> 
               <p>'Language would fail to make it clearer to those who ought to understand it,' replied the Smuggler; 'but, governor, be patient; time revealeth all things; thou art yet many times to be astonished, ere thy career hath run.-And now, your excellency, our business of to-night is complete; if it would please thee to have a night of merriment with my gallants, they shall immediately rejoin us.'</p> 
               <p>'Pardon me, if I decline,' said Gonzala; 'and if the term of my imprisonment hath expired, I shall be most pleased to take my departure.'</p> 
               <p>'By my good sword, governor, it is not fair of thee thus to abuse my hospitality,' replied the Smuggler; 'we, who have within the hour, ate, drank, fought and transacted business together, should regard each other in the agreeable light of host and guest; thrice have I repudiated the singular idea that hath entered thy brain that thou art my prisoner. Dispel it altogether, I conjure thee.'</p> 
               <p>'Am I free to depart?'</p> 
               <p>'Who is he that dareth to detain for a moment the powerful sovereign of this fair isle?' continued the Smuggler. 'Thou art free to go and come whenever it pleaseth thee; and in anticipation of thy desire to leave us thus early, I have caused a carriage to be kept in waiting at the door. It is at thy disposal.'</p> 
               <p>'Thy generosity hath no bounds,' said Gonzala, with spiteful irony, as he turned on his heel to depart.</p> 
               <p>'Thanks for thy noble compliment,' said Azvedo, imitating the governor's manner of speech.</p> 
               <p>Gonzala was politely assisted into the carriage, and as the door was closed, the Smuggler said,</p> 
               <p>'Farewell, governor; thou wilt not fail to keep thy bond?'</p> 
               <p>Thou wilt not long have any reason to doubt me,' replied Gonzala, with rather suspicious emphasis, as the driver cracked his whip, and the vehicle rolled away' 'and of I do keep the first condition of it,' continued he to himself, 'may all the fiends of hell torment me for folly and cowardice!'</p> 
               <p>'Will he dare prove treacherous?' muttered the Smuggler to himself, as he returned slowly to the apartment he had just quitted.</p> 
               <p>It was one hour past midnight. While all the city seemed hushed in slumber, there was unusual bustle and confusion in and about the palace of the governor. Soon a troop of horsemen, followed by several companies of Spanish musketeers, was seen to issue from the great gate, cross the grand Plaza, and after marching down one of the principal avenues of the city, the horsemen broke up into several detachments, and separated in such a manner, as to surround one of the most aristocratic squares of the city, while the musketeers continued on a few rods, and came to a halt before the hotel then reputed to be occupied by the Marquis Villefana, but in fact was the locale of the curious interview we have described.</p> 
               <p>No music, not even the tap of a drum accompanied the troops in their midnight expedition, and they trod the ground as softly as possible; even the orders were passed from the commander to the subalterns, and from the subalterns to the privates, in whispering tones. At the several gates, along the pathways, in the front and rear of the mansion, to the very doors, double files of musketeers were cautiously stationed, with loaded muskets and bayonets fixed, ready for any emergency.</p> 
               <p>During all these martial movements outside of the hotel, all seemed quiet within.-The lights were extinguished, the shutters closed, and it appeared more like a deserted mansion than one occupied. This appeared<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6943-00000023"/> singular to the commanding officer, for with all the prudence exercised in completely surrounding the establishment, as well as the square, considerable noise and confusion were impossible to avoid.</p> 
               <p>A company of musketeers, proceeded by four men from the corps of sappers and miners, armed with ponderous axes, marched up to the principal entrance. The door was tried, and to the surprise of every one it was unfastened, and its folds readily swung back upon their hinges. Torches were lighted, and the soldiers entered the house without the slightest opposition, and began to search its many apartments. It was, indeed, deserted. From the cellar to the roof, every room, closet, and crevice, and every piece of furniture, capable of concealing a human being was closely scrutinized, and no living thing was discovered, although in the apartment where the banquet was served, a lighted taper, covered by a shade, was still burning, giving certain evidence that not more than a half an hour had elapsed since the room was vacated. The commander of the expedition, on lifting the shade from the taper light, discovered a sealed note lying beside it, and perceiving that it bore the address of 'His Excellency the Governor-General of Cuba,' he thrust it into his belt, uttering an oath and a speech, indicating that the audacious villains had probably announced their departure in writing to his excellency.</p> 
               <p>Finding the search fruitless, he stationed a strong guard within and without the premises, then giving several orders to his subordinates, he mounted his house, and, accompanied by his staff, galloped off with all possible speed toward the palace. Dismounting, and giving the bridle rein to a groom, he entered the palace, and was quickly ushered into the governor's presence.</p> 
               <p>'This quick return, general, argues that the great outlaw is at length in our power! Is it not so?'</p> 
               <p>No, your excellency, it argues that he has slipped through our fingers!' answered the officer.</p> 
               <p>'Escaped again! By all the fiends, this is too provoking, general!' exclaimed the angry governor. 'In what manner could he possibly have escaped?'</p> 
               <p>'That is an enigma that I cannot solve.-We found the house deserted.'</p> 
               <p>'Deserted? Hast not captured even one of his comrades?'</p> 
               <p>'We found not so much as a rat to capture in the whole establishment.'</p> 
               <p>'And yet scarcely an hour has elapsed, since I, myself, was there, detained by the bold Smuggler and men against my will-a sort of prisoner to these cut-throat rascals.'</p> 
               <p>"In truth, there were indications that they had not decamped more than fifteen minutes before we entered; and that reminds me, said the officer, drawing the letter from beneath his sash, that he had found in the out-law's apartment, 'to deliver to you this note, which I found lying beside a lighted taper; the ink of the superscription was scarcely dry when I picked it up.'</p> 
               <p>'Then he must have had a wonderfully narrow escape,' said Gonzala, receiving the letter, and examining the crown-seal and the bold chirography of the address.</p> 
               <p>'By the Ten Virgins, I'd swear that was the Smuggler's writing; it is so remarkably characteristic of the dare devil whose hand penned it! Who knows, except himself,' said Gonzala, with a shudder, 'that this envelope does not contain a subtle, impalpable poison? By my faith, it hath a suspicious look about it; and this outlaw, I have no doubt, dealeth in every hellish art ever penetrated into by man! I'll not break the seal!'</p> 
               <p>He walked to a distant corner of the room, and placed it upon a stand. Then returning he took up a bell, and rang it. Zango, the mulatto slave obeyed the summons.</p> 
               <p>'Zango,' said the governor, 'there is a letter upon the light-stand!'</p> 
               <p>'Me see um, massa,' said Zango.</p> 
               <p>'Take up that letter, Zango!'</p> 
                
               <p>'Ees, massa, I takes um up.'</p> 
               <p>'Break the seal, Zango!'</p> 
               <p>The mulatto gazed towards his master with doubt and astonishment depicted upon his swarthy features.</p> 
               <p>'Me break um seal, massa?' he ejaculated as he stared first upon one side of the missive and then upon the other; 'no for me-gem'um hab letter, massa-Zango, neber!'</p> 
               <p>'Break the seal?' again commanded the governor.</p> 
               <p>'Ees massa gubnor, Zango break um-seal broke, massa.'</p> 
               <p>'Now, Zango, remove the envelope, unfold the sheet within, and then bring it to me.'</p> 
               <p>Whether Zango, like his cautions master, suddenly entertained a suspicion that it contained some mysterious agent, that was in a moment to sunder his connection with earth, or not, we cannot positively state, but certain it is that his hands, then his nether limbs, then his whole body, began a tremulous motion, over which he seemed to have no control.</p> 
               <p>'I is afraid, um, massa!' gunboat dis letter am frum de debil hesef,' said Zango, his teeth chattering like the clattering of a dozen pair of castanets.</p> 
               <p>Do as I command, Zango,' said the governor, catching the trembling affection from his slave.</p> 
               <p>'I is afraid of um, massa!' cried out the mulatto.</p> 
               <p>'Durst thou disobey me, you black villain!' said Gonzala, his fears turning to anger,-'Do as I bid thee, or with this pistol I'll blow out your brains!' and he aimed a weapon which he drew from his belt at the frightened negro.</p> 
               <p>'Ees, ees, massa, I opens um,' stammered Zango, extending his arms, and unfolding the suspicious missive. 'Do letter am open, massa.'</p> 
               <p>'Bring it hither?'</p> 
               <p>Zango approached and placed the harmless document in the governor's hand.</p> 
               <p>'What are you frightened at, Zango?'</p> 
               <p>'Nuffin, nuffin, massa,' replied the mulatto; 'Zango neber 'fore open gemmum's letter.'</p> 
               <p>'You can retire.'</p> 
               <p>'Tank you, tank you bery much, massa gubnor,' said Zango, bowing and retiring.</p> 
               <p>Gonzala now read the note, which had, in fact, proved much more of a bugbear to him than to his slave. It was couched in the following terms:</p> 
               <p>"Knowing your excellency's peculiar characteristics, and myself and comrades having no taste for such public notoriety, as the exhibition which it is thy design to amuse the populace with at the expense of our necks, would give, we have deemed it advisable to absent ourselves from the city, until such period as circumstances will render it perfectly safe for us to pay thee another visit. To save thee the trouble of searching the city for the outlaw and his men, go, at sunrise tomorrow morning to the high tower of the Moro, and thou mayest learn the whereabouts of thy complacent enemy, THE SMUGGLER KING."</p> 
               <p>'By the Ten Virgins, that is cool, general! exclaimed Gonzala. 'How he and his merry companions, as he calls them, can have passed the walls of the city in the dead hours of night, is past my understanding.'</p> 
               <p>'There must be treachery in some quarter,' suggested the officer.</p> 
               <p>'Or the Smuggler is the Devil!' added the bewildered governor. 'Go to the Moro Castle, he says, at sunrise, and I shall learn of his whereabouts. I will go; general meet me there.'</p> 
               <p>'Si, excellency,' said the officer, and saluting the governor, he retired.</p> 
               <p>When the morning gun from the castle announced the rising of the sun, and the Spanish flag waved over its walls, Gonzala; surrounded by his staff, was gazing through a telescope at two schooners and a brig, lying-to' with sails set, about four miles distant. The castle gun was responded to from the nearest vessel, and a ball of bunting was run up to the mast-head, and when its folds were extended to the breeze, the well known ensign<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6943-00000024"/> of the free-trader was displayed in defiance to the astonished governor!</p> 
               <p>The under a fresh south-westerly breeze stood away for the Bahama Isles!</p> 
               <p>'Diablo!' was the only exclamation of his excellency.</p>

               <p>AGAIN, patient reader, we must change the scene from the majestic queen of the Antilles, to one of the many bright and sparkling emeralds that gem her lustrous refuge of the Smuggler King.</p> 
               <p>Several weeks have elapsed since the tornado, described in the earlier pages if this tale, had, with its terrific, devastating fury, swept over its fertile fields and fruitful gardens, and wrecked upon it rock-ribbed barriers, a noble vessel, and cast upon its shores a solitary being out of a crew, numbered by scores of souls.</p> 
               <p>It was yet early in the evening of one of those lovely tropical days, when the ocean breeze tempers the arid atmosphere; when the gloriously brilliant constellations of the southern hemisphere chine out in resplendent beauty; when the ocean is not agitated by the fury of tropical storms; when all is bright, beautiful and balmy among the fair Islands of the Carribean Sea; it was on such an evening as this that we return to the scene of the opening incidents of our romantic tale of adventures.</p> 
               <p>In the vine-trelliced verandah of Don Fernando de Azvedo's villa, a Peruvian hammock was swinging to and fro by the slight efforts of sybil the young quadroon slave, almost the rival of her mistress in voluptuous charms. In the hammock was reclining Dona Anita, the proprietor of this ocean paradise, and the queenly mistress of the isle! Anita was lovely, surpassingly lovely as we have before observed, but she never seemed more transcendently beautiful than on this occasion. Her large, lustrous blue eyes, vied in sparkling brilliancy with the stars they gazed upon; her sweet lips were red as the rose, revealing with every word that she spoke a set of teeth, rivalling pearls in whiteness; her complexion wads clear and transparent, and even fairer than most of the maidens of the north, while upon her cheeks a delicate tinge of a roseate hue relieved her otherwise too delicate skin; her long wavy black hair, dressed a la Grecque, heightened the loveliness of her facial charms; her fair round arms were bare, and on her wrists a pair of diamond and emerald studded bracelets sparkled like the moonbeams upon the rippling waters of the bay at her feet. But mere physical beauty was not all Anita might have boasted she was endowed with an intellect, cultivated chiefly by one of rare accomplishments; a soul that lent a vivacious and spirited expression to lineaments of wondrous beauty. So fair so animated, all the isles of the Antilles; for it will be remembered that Anita was the daughter of an Ionian Princess, celebrated for her loveliness, while her father, a truly handsome man, could boast of having the noblest blood of all Andalusia coursing in his veins. Upon this fair creature's snowy white bosom, a white turtle dove rested, which she caressed with as much fondness as if it had been an infant</p> 
               <p>'I would our invalid guest were awake-he sleeps too long,' she remarked as the permitted the dove to peck her lips with its bill.</p> 
               <p>'Yes, misses, he sleep bery sound,' replied sybil.</p> 
               <p>'I have fondled thee enough to-night, my pretty bird,' said Anita addressing the dove.</p> 
               <p>'Away to thy cote! I shall incur the jealous displeasure of thy mate, if I detain thee longer.'</p> 
               <p>The tame pet perched upon her jewelled wrist, and more pecking her lips, flew away to the dove-cote.</p> 
               <p>'Go now, Sybil,' said Anita 'go softly to the couch of the American, and see if he yet slumbers; have a car that thy movements do not awake him,'</p> 
               <p>'Me go bery softly,' said the slightly bronzed quadroon, as she flitted noiselessly along the verandah, and disappeared through an open casement.</p> 
               <p>'He should have awoke ere this,' soliloquised Dona Anita; 'and when again awake, if old Chloe's prediction be verified his consciousness will have returned. Holy Virgin! grant that it may! 'Tis strange, indeed, that he slumbers thus long; and yet, it is not so very strange, for how intensely hath this interesting American stranger suffered. Oh! holy mother! invoke thee to restore him to reason and to health again! Who can he be? He hath a noble countenance, surpassing that of any of the gallants of the isles. Even while lying unconscious, after the dreadful tornado, half buried among the seaweed, shells and sands of the beach, did I not then say to my own heart, so handsome and so noble a youth, these eyes ne'er dwelt upon? May all the saints protect him! for should my stern father find him here on his return will be bot in danger? Will he not be angry with his daughter, for succoring this stranger? Alas! I fear his frowns. What to be done? Heaven aid and direct me! That I do love him with all my heart, soul and strength, is most true-I, who dare not well that for many days he should remain here; and yet he must not be permitted until in perfect health, to leave the island. Depart! never to return? My heart shudders at the thought!'</p> 
               <p>The love-stricken maiden's soliloquy was cut short by the return of Sybil, who, with delight beaming from her large black eyes, said--'</p> 
               <p>'Oh, missus! he no sleep now-he bery well-he walking in de room-me tink he coming out door--</p> 
               <p>'Hush, Sybil, I think I hear his footsteps-he is coming this way!' interrupted Anita, quickly leaping from out the hammock, and hastening towards the door, where she met the invalid stranger, who, with enfeebled limbs, was venturing to sally forth to inhale the invigorating evening atmosphere, for the first time since his confinement.</p> 
               <p>'Lean thy arm upon mine,' said the noble-hearted maiden, thou art yet too feeble to support thyself; thou must not overtax thy little strength.'</p> 
               <p>He availed himself of her sustaining arm, and walked together along the verandah, until they reached a rustic settee, made of the unshaven branches of the orange tree, and covered with a rich Persian shawl. Here they seated themselves.</p> 
               <p>'This evening air is pure,' remarked the American; 'it is not so in our climate; the sick dare not there venture forth at night.'</p> 
               <p>'The air to-night is truly delicious,' said Anita; 'and I am delighted to know that thy strength hath so much returned to enable thee to come forth and enjoy it. ON such an evening as this no noxious vapors arise to poison the purity of the atmosphere.'</p> 
               <p>The youth involuntarily turned his eye upon the fair being, who, with a voice more melodious than he ever heard from mortal lips, had thus addressed him. For many moments he gazed abstractedly, and in silence, while her eyes were fixed upon a bright star, near the western horizon. He at length spake, as if doubting the corporeal nature of the beautiful creature beside him:</p> 
               <p>'Do I still dream? or art thou in reality a being of earth?'</p> 
               <p>'Ah, Senor,' she replied, 'I am no nymph of the wood, the rocks, or the sea; simply a maiden of the isle-nothing more nor less do<pb n="52-53 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6943-00000025"/> I assure thee. But why dost thou ask so singular a question?'</p> 
               <p>'I have seen thee oft of late, in my dreams, flitting about the room in which I have slept, and sitting even beside my coach, as if thou wert a ministering angel from Heaven. Until now have I seen thee, except in my visions.'</p> 
               <p>'I am sure it was in thy waking dreams,' said the maiden; 'or, perhaps I should say in those long hours when thy mental perception was in a bewildered state; when, too, thou wert suffering under bodily anguish, which our medicinal simples and little skill failed to assuage.'</p> 
               <p>'Indeed!' exclaimed the invalid with surprise; 'how long has it been thus?'</p> 
               <p>'To-morrow, four weeks will have passed away.'</p> 
               <p>'Impossible! do I not still dream? is not this unreal? he ejaculated; 'no, this can be no tantalizing vision! I am awake! and yet it seemeth but last night that I stood upon the deck of our noble vessel, in the midst of that fearful tornado; when we were cast upon that destructive reef! when I heard the crash! the cries to Heaven for mercy! the heart-rending shrieks and--oh God! I can remember no more! Oh! what can have been my poor comrades' fate? perhaps thou canst tell me, fair lady?'</p> 
               <p>'One more sad never befel adventurous mariners.'</p> 
               <p>'Speak the worst, I intreat of thee?'</p> 
               <p>'It is not known that a single person escaped beside thyself!'</p> 
               <p>'All, dost thou say, perished? Oh, God! was not there another spared?'</p> 
               <p>'Not one; but think not of that scene!' entreated Anita; 'thou art too ill; wait but two or three days, until thy strength hath returned, and all shall be told thee.'</p> 
               <p>'I will obey thy bidding, fair lady,' said he; 'though I feel strong to-night; that glowing heat no longer burns my flesh; my tongue is no longer parched; those molten streams of lead no longer dart, like heated quicksilver, through my veins; I feel as if I had for hours been crawling from out a fiery furnace, and but now have emerged from its mouth; my pulse, too, indicates health,' said he, placing his right finger upon his left wrist, and then extended his hand towards Anita.</p> 
               <p>She took it gently within her own, and placing her finger upon the beating artery she carefully counted its pulsations by a richly jewel-cased watch, which she took from the belt of her waist.</p> 
               <p>'Eightly,' she at length said; 'last night I counted one hundred and ten; this morning ninety-five; since then thou hast had an uninterrupted sleep. The physician enjoins thyself but slightly.'</p> 
               <p>'My physician? pray who is he? I have seen no physician. I remember but thy face, and two or three dark-skinned creatures who I suppose were my attendants.'</p> 
               <p>'It is true thou hast had no professed physician to attend thee; but an aged Ethiopian woman, somewhat skilled in medicinal herbs, Sybil and myself, have been thy constant attendants.'</p> 
               <p>'Heaven bless thee lady!' exclaimed the young stranger; 'how can I ever repay such kindness. Tell me thy name, that I may know my preserver.'</p> 
               <p>'I claim not to be thy preserver,' replied Anita.</p> 
               <p>'Something tells me, even now, that to thee am I indebted for life; but, fair lady, thou wilt not refuse to tell me thy name?' urged the invalid.</p> 
               <p>'It is a simple one-Anita.'</p> 
               <p>'Thy father's name?'</p> 
               <p>'Don Fernando de Azvedo,' she replied 'but thou must not task thy strength to-night, by protracting this interview.'</p> 
               <p>'Permit me but to ask thee of the manner in which I was rescued from out that fearful vortex of raging water; the name of this spot, for, if I mistake not, our vessel was

                  <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6943-00000026"/>
                   dashed upon the rocks of a desolate and uninhabitable island, and--'</p> 
               <p>'Speak no more, Senor, I pray thee,' admonished Anita, interrupting the youth, in which she had taken so much interest. 'If thou wilt but listen, and let me do the speaking, thy reasonable curiosity shall be gratified. On the morning after the tornado, I despatched, at an early hour, a number of our people, to search for any unfortunate beings, who might have been cast upon our shores, for, during the gale, I heard wild shrieks, as if from human beings in peril. Several bodies, bereft of life, were discovered, and, at my bidding, were buried in the sands, above the surf's utmost reach. Thy body, half concealed by seaweed and sand, was also found; but, though utterly unconscious, life was not extinct, I caused thee to be removed hither, where thou hast suffered much, probably for lack, of skilful medical treatment; but, the fever appears now to have left thee, and if thou canst be patient for a few days longer, thy wonted health will be restored to thee. While Senor de Azcedo is absent, thou shalt be a welcome guest at his villa. He is the undisputed possessor of this fruitful littler island, which, to all who pass it in ships, seems but a bleak and barren rock, and serves only as an ugly looking landmark. It is known to many by the name of the Smuggler's Isle! Startle not, Senor! there is not so much crime committed hero as in places bearing a less obnoxious cognomen. My father, Dou Azvedo, although an acknowledged refugee, hath power even to make the island potentates respect and fear him. He is now absent on an important expedition, but his return may be looked for with any wind that can waft his fleet homeward from the northern isles,'</p> 
               <p>'A fleet!' exclaimed the invalid; 'hath he then the command of a fleet?'</p> 
               <p>'Si, Senor; but more, to-night, I cannot tell thee. Go to thy couch; be <unclear>patient; get</unclear> well, and thou shalt hereafter know more. Remember, it is thy physician who commands,' said Anita, in gently chiding tones.</p> 
               <p>'Never was patient more tractable under professional hands than I under thine,' replied the youth, rising from his seat.</p> 
               <p>With the assistance of Anita, he slowly made his way back to the apartment, which, for nearly four weeks, until that night, he had not quitted. He had, during this period, been suffering from a virulent attack of the yellow fever, and until that day had its tormenting symptoms ceased.</p> 
               <p>Anita and the invalid separated for the night. The former, after giving instructions to those whom she had selected to attend upon the wants of the patient, retired to her boudoir, and there, before an altar, offered up thanks to the Virgin, for the convalescence of the interesting stranger, whom Providence had cast upon the Isle.</p> 
               <milestone n="-" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>On the third morning after the interview between the unknown stranger and Anita, the inmates of the villa were alarmed by an unusual uproar, proceeding from a party of negro slaves, who had come up to inform their mistress of an event which had occurred during the night.</p> 
               <p>"What means this unusual commotion?' demanded Anita, who had hastily attired herself, and appeared upon the verandah before a score or more of blacks, who appeared half frightened out of their wits.</p> 
               <p>'Oh, missus!' cried out the most courageous of the negroes, pointing to the vessel in the little bay, the deck of which was now alive with men, and who appeared to be making preparations for getting her underweigh; 'de vessel am seized, and we shall all be killed, missus!'</p> 
               <p>'Ah! what treachery is this?' demanded Anita, looking towards the trim little schooner, which had been lying for some weeks at anchor in the inlet, and in a partially dismantled state. 'Who and what are those men aboard the Albatross?'</p> 
               <p>'Massa Curcamo, all de wite men, and<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6943-00000027"/> Mungo, Pepe, Yarra, and oders!' replied the negro.</p> 
               <p>'Curcamo escaped! the wretch! As I suspected, treachery most foul hath been at work! Who guarded his dungeon last night?'</p> 
               <p>'Diego and Yarra, missus?'</p> 
               <p>'I see it a I,' said Anita; 'here is mischief indeed! Bribery hath done this work!-Men, if thou hast any love for thy mistress, go and arm-that vessel must not be permitted to leave the inlet! We are lost, if the villain Curcamo makes his escape!'</p> 
               <p>'Ah, missue, dey be bery trong, hab moss men, big gun, all fight, missus.'</p> 
               <p>'Have courage! if they attempt to pass the narrow entrance, the advantage will be on our side. Obey my orders, and will yet be well. Hourly do I except the arrival of my father's fleet, and then every one of these traitors will be hanged or shot!'</p> 
               <p>This speech had a good effect upon the irresolute men, and they started off to a rocky cave, which was fashioned into an armory, where the surplus arms of the island were usually kept; but their surprise and fears were greatly increased, when they discovered that the intended deserters had been there before them, and absolutely possessed themselves of every weapon fit for use; in fact there was nothing left, but a few old muskets without lock, and several rusty and broken sabres. They immediately returned to the villa, and informed their mistress of the miscreants' doings at the armory.</p> 
               <p>'Then they have a greater crime to answer for!' said the yet undaunted girl. 'Have courage still-all is not lost! In my father's room there are weapons for ye all!'</p> 
               <p>To Sybil Anita gave the key of her father's private apartment. The beautiful slave led six of the men to the room designated, who soon returned, landed with muskets, carbines, pistols, pikes, cutlasses and sabres!</p> 
               <p>'These,' said Anita, 'are the choice weapons of my father; arm yourselves, and have a care that not a single one be disgraced!'</p> 
               <p>Every one of the slaves was quickly armed, and a plenty of ammunition was apportioned out to them by Sybil, who took as active and as interested a part in this matter as did her heroic mistress.</p> 
               <p>'Go,' continued Anita, 'to the thicket on the northerly side of the pass to the inlet, and there conceal yourselves; proceed by the orange path that thy movements may not be observed from the Albatross. At the proper time, there will be a leader in your midst, whose commands must be implicitly obeyed! Be cautions and courageous!</p> 
               <p>The negroes started off in the direction in direction, while Anita, Sybil, and the household attendants, entered the house, where a sort of warklike consultation was held, and a plan of operations agreed upon!</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile there was the greatest activity on board of the Albatross. Her topmasts and yards had to be sent up and rigged; all her sails to be bent; her guns put in working order; her decks cleared, and water and provisions to be stored. These latter necessaries had been secretly conveyed on board two nights previous, and immediately after the treacherous plot had been agreed upon. Curcamo's dungeon door had been opened on the night preceding, soon after the time for the retiring of the inhabitants of the island. A boat, with muffled oars, was ready to convey him to the schooner, and he was soon on her deck, surrounded by those who had agreed to revolt. At a signal, they all retired to the cabin, where a horrid oath was administered to Curcamo, by one appointed for the purpose, which he fully ascribed to; he was then invested with a cutlass, a pair of pistols, a sash, and a black velvet cap, with a coffin emblazoned upon its front, and further ornamented with a waving black plume!-He was then hailed, by all present, with the title of 'Blackwing, Chief of the Caribbean Corsairs!'</p> 
               <p>This ceremony having been gone through with, orders were given to put the Albatross in sea-going order with all possible despatch, and when she was first discovered at early dawn from on shore, the craft had nearly resumed her usual neat and trim appearance, and in defiance of the discovery made by the people on shore, the men were kept diligently at work. What cared the treacherous Curcamo, alias Blackwing, for all the force that could be there mustered against him? He had caused their arms to be stolen, and unless the much-to-be dreaded Smuggler King should arrive just in time to thwart them in their villany, the newly sworn Pirate had nought to fear!</p> 
               <p>It was ten o'clock, in the forenoon, where a gun was fired from the Albatross, in salutation of a black flag, with a white coffin emblazoned upon it, which a moment before was ran up to mast-head, and now floated upon the gentle breeze blowing sea-ward!</p> 
               <p>Orders were given to unmoor, as soon as the roar of the gun had died away. The tide had reached its highest flood, and had began slightly to ebb, it being the design of Blackwing to make the run of the narrow pass at a time when the tide ebbed most swiftly thro' it, to avoid injuries from stones, or other missiles that might be thrown from the high blurt which they must pass by.</p> 
               <p>The anchor was aweigh, sail made upon the craft, and she moved across the little bay towards the narrow outlet. Some precaution was made by arming a detachment of the men, though to all appearances there were no believing that they had neither men nor arms to recklessly venture upon an attack-Once clear of the isle, it was the farther intention of Blackwing to send a midnight expedition, in boats, back to the island, for a purpose worthy of the black-hearted miscreant, which will be developed hereafter.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, Dona Anita's watchful eye had been upon the movements of the Albatross. Nothing that was observable had escaped her knowledge; and when the corsairs' black flag was raised and saluted, she armed with sword and pistols, and wearing the undress uniform of a Spani midshipman, was ready to go forth and expose herself to the dangerous of a bloody fight. Sybil, too, with some fifteen female servants, also armed, and attired in Semi-masculine habiliments, were ready to follow her.</p> 
               <p>As they were on the point of starting, the young invalid American made his appearance, and approaching Anita, said-</p> 
               <p>'I intreat of thee, fair lady, not to expose thy life to those desperate men. Give me the direction of this whole affair, and I swear to thee to risk all, even my life, in thy good cause.'</p> 
               <p>'I thank thee,' replied Anita, 'and were it not that thou art yet feeble from the effects of thy long illness, I should not have exempted thee from the perils of this expedition.'</p> 
               <p>'That can not, shall not be,' replied the maiden, who looked not unlike an Amazonian heroine. 'Follow, if thou wilt, but expose not thyself needlessly to the enemy.'</p> 
               <p>This novel looking military corps now took up their march for the spot where the loyal negroes were hid in ambush, which they reached some twenty minutes before the vessel had entered the narrow strait, meanwhile a small detachment of the slaves, with the advice of the young American, had clambered to the highest point of the cliff, and by crouching down were not observable from the enemy's deck.</p> 
               <p>Onward, impelled solely by the sift current, came the Albatross; and ere she reached the thicket, above the cliff, the shrill voice of Anita was heard giving the order to fire! A score or more of muskets were discharged almost simultaneously, and the Pirate's deck was, for the first time, baptized in their own blood! Three of the wretches had already paid the penalty of their treachery, and more would have fallen, had not the chief taken the precaution to order all the men below, save enough to work the schooner, and some<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6943-00000028"/> half dozen musketeers, who returned a random fire into the thicket!</p> 
               <p>Blackwing, startled at the report of the musketry, rushed upon deck, with drawn cutlass in hand, followed by his whole crew. Another discharge of small arms from their unseen enemy, now told with redoubled effect upon the piratical crew! One of the quarter-deck guns, charged with grape and canister was ordered to be fired into the thicket, but ere it could be brought to bear upon the men in ambush, the tide had swept the vessel past the spot, and when directly beneath the overhanging cliff, the summit of which was just as high as the fore-truck of the schooner, an unseen, an unexpected obstacle suddenly presented itself!-the vessel's speed was suddenly retarded, and finally she was brought up, all standing, beneath the cliff! The first thought of Blackwing was, that she had run aground, or that a chain or hawser had been thrown across the channel, neither of which, however, he soon discovered was the cause. His eye was now directed aloft, when to his surprise and amazement he saw that three or four ropes extended from both fore and main cross-tress to the top of the bluff, but to what fastened could not be discerned from the deck of the vessel. Presently, a shower of rocks and other missiles descended upon the heads of the piratical crew, who vainly strove to defend themselves by firing upon an unseen enemy!</p> 
               <p>Here was a dilemma which Blackwing had no anticipated. He raved like a chafed tiger, and swore all kinds of vengeance upon the heads of his foes!</p> 
               <p>'To the boats!' he cried, addressing the musketeers.</p> 
               <p>One of the quarter-boats was lowered, and the boat floating at the stern was brought alongside. These was quickly filled with men, well armed.</p> 
               <p>'Land below the cliff!' ordered the chief 'clear the rock of every d--d one of them! Then dive into the thicket! Show no quarter! massacre every d--d hellhound that you meet! The concealed treasures of the villa shall be your first booty and your reward!'</p> 
               <p>Stimulated by this promise the men shoved off with loud huzzas, and quickly floated down the channel.</p> 
               <p>The destructive missiles were coming thicker and faster down upon the deck, seriously injuring almost every man that they struck, and already had killed three outright!</p> 
               <p>'Aloft, there, boys!' he cried, to a number of men, who were striving to screen their bodies from the stones which were flying upon the deck, by crouching behind the caboose and beneath the bulwarks.</p> 
               <p>'Aloft, there! and cut those fastenings!' he again ordered.</p> 
               <p>These men, and nearly every one of them were negroes, hesitated to obey, for they did not relish hazarding their lives in so perilous an undertaking. Blackwing, gnashing his teeth with rage, and brandishing his cutlass fearfully, rushed towards the disobedient men, and with curses and oaths, threatened to strike down the first man who hesitated.</p> 
               <p>His terrible anger and determined manner had its effect. They started up, leaped into the fore and main rigging, and nimbly as so many wild men of the woods, scrambled up the ratlines, despite the shower of rocks with which they were pelted! Several of them received severe contusions upon their heads lost their hold of the rigging, and fell head-long to the deck, lifeless corpses! Several finally reached the cross-trees, and with their sharp sabres quickly severed the fastenings. But they paid dearly for their temerity; a few well directed musket shots sent them tumbling to the deck, where many of their comrades already lay weltering in gore!</p> 
               <p>The Albatross was now free, and the rapidly ebbing tide floated her down the channel and out of the reach of immediate dangers.</p> 
               <p>The men who had landed in the boats were ascending the bluff on the landward side, confident of clearing it at the first onslaught; but what was their astonishment find, on getting sight of the enemy, they had only women, headed by a beardless boy to cope with; and, however much reluctance they might have felt in carrying out the sanguinary mandate of their chief, they believed to do otherwise would ensure their own destruction. When they first beheld these feminine combatants, they were engaged in hurling missiles from the cliff; but the moment they were themselves perceived, they wheeled quickly about, snatched their muskets from the earth, and discharged such a well-directed volley among them, that a number fell, and the remainder turned upon their heels and fled toward the boats! On finding they were not pursued, their leader was enabled to arrest their flight, and they rallied for the purpose of making a more judicious attack.</p> 
               <p>By this time, however, the schooner had been cut adrift, and the gallant party of the cliff descended in good order, not having lost a--woman! In the vale, they were rejoined by the negroes, who had done such good service in the thicket, and while congratulating themselves upon their victory, they espied the boats' crews returning to give them battle! The latter, now perceiving that the victors had been materially reinforced, halted, and after a short consultation, wisely determined to beat a retreat!</p> 
               <p>The moment they turned their backs, the enemy commenced a hot pursuit, and by the time the retreating party had gained their boats, the pursuers had got within musket range, and poured a deadly fire among them! The Albatross was lying-to in the offing, and when the boats finally reached her, it was ascertained that more than one half of both boats' crew were among the missing! And of the whole number of the traitorous deserters, more than one third had already been either killed or wounded! It was a terrible lesson to the survivors, and seemed a just retribution to those who had fallen in the strife!</p> 
               <p>The victors shouted on the final repulse of the assailants, and loud cries of 'Viva! viva! Anita!'</p> 
               <p>'No, my brave people,' said Anita, 'to this American stranger, who has been providentially thrown among us, do we owe the results of this victory. It was through him that we detained the schooner in the narrow pass; and inflicted upon the wretches the chastisement they deserved. Though I was nominally thy leader, he directed all our movements!'</p> 
               <p>'Viva le American!' was now the cry of the triumphant islanders.</p> 
               <p>The youthful stranger protested against this demonstration; but it had the effect which the maiden desired, and that was to inspire in her people love and confidence for one whom she had learned to love in spite of herself, and whom she had learned to love in spite of herself, and whom she had taken the responsibility of treating as a favored guest in her father's mansion!</p>

               </p> 
               <p>THE Albatross, during the remainder of the eventful day of her hazardous escape, was lying in the offing, about four miles distant from the scene of the late conflict. It was feared, and even expected, by the Islanders and their mistress, that the Pirates would hazard another attack during the night; but they, one and all, resolved to be prepared to receive them, and to give them a warm reception. A strong guard was stationed<pb n="60-61 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6943-00000029"/> tioned at the mouth of the Inlet, and preparations were also made to defend the villa, if perchance, the buccaneers succeeded in making a landing. The night, however, passed by without so much as an alarm, and when another day dawned, the schooner, somewhat to the surprise of our heroine, had disappeared. the ocean was scanned in every possible direction, and no sail was visible, except a large ship-to all appearances an American merchantman,-under a cloud of canvas, which passed the isle at a distance of about five miles, her course lying due north.</p> 
               <p>Another day and night, and yet another, passed, and as the dreaded Albatross made not her appearance, it was thought expedient to relax their vigilance, and only keep sentinels posted during the hours of the night.</p> 
               <p>The object of their fears, mean while, had been cruising in the Caribbean Sea, with the hope of overhauling and capturing some rich prize. The Pirate Chief, Blackwing, saw the almost immediate necessity of glutting the eyes of his crew with booty, in order to pacify a spirit of dissatisfaction that was already beginning to manifest itself, and to cause them to forget their first severe experience since they had taken the Pirates' bloody oath.</p> 
               <p>On the second night after they had lost night of the Smugglers' Isle, a dark, thick mist hovered over the sea, rendering it quite impossible to discern any object at more than two cables length distance. Sail was reduced to the mainsail, staysail, and foretopsail, nearly close-hauled, the wind being one point forward the beam, and her course west, two points north. The watch below had gone to their hammocks, the signal lantern was suspended to the fore-topmast stay, the sails carefully trimmed, the loose rigging coiled up, the watch set, and everything alow and aloft made, secure and snug for the dismal, dirty night.</p> 
               <p>The chief, and his second lieutenant, yarra, who had been appointed to that post because of the lack of competent white men, were the officers of the watch, and stood up on the quarter-deck, in earnest conversation.</p> 
               <p>'To-morrow,' remarked Blackwing, 'if we fail to fall in with any prize, we must turn our prow for the isle, surprise the d--d slaves and take possession, until we make secure the immense wealth, which I know don Fernando has secreted in some part of the stone villa.'</p> 
               <p>'We shall have our hands full,' suggested Yarra; 'depend upon it, they will keep up a strict guard at the inlet, until reinforced by the arrival of the Smuggler's fleet.'</p> 
               <p>'True; but we'll not make the attack in that quarter,' said the chief.</p> 
               <p>'But there is no other place of landing, chief!'</p> 
               <p>'Let me tell thee a secret, Yarra. Since I have been cooped up on that isle, I have explored every part of it, especially its rocky shores. Do you remember the narrow Sandy beach, near the southerly point of the island, where the great coral reef lies?'</p> 
               <p>'Sir, Senor Capitan.'</p> 
               <p>'I have examined it frequently, and have ascertained that, at a certain state of the tide, and in favorable weather, there is a safe passage for boats from the beach to the open sea. To-morrow night should the weather be calm and clear, our boats can there make a landing in safety.'</p> 
               <p>'No craft over yet ventured to run ashore there,' said Yarra.</p> 
               <p>'So much the better,' returned Blackwing; 'for so much the less will our enemies upon the isle suspect that it is possible we should venture to land at any other than the usual point. Once ashore, with twenty determined man, woman and child will be completely at our mercy.'</p> 
               <p>'Sir Senor.'</p> 
               <p>'Let it be known, Yarra, among all the men, that no quarter is to he given, except top Dona Anita herself; she must be seized, and carried aboard the schooner, without so much as one hair of her head being harmed. Let 
                  <figure> 
                     <head>FEARFUL ATTACK UPON THE ALBATROSS.</head> 
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6943-00000030"/>
                   it likewise be known, Yarra, that the chief in this case, relinquishes his share of the booty; every maravedi shall be fairly divided among the men. I shall be content with the possession of so much beauty as the fair Senorita can boast of.'</p> 
               <p>'Si, Senor Capitan,' replied the yellow lieutenant; 'and I desire to make a similar stipulation; 'I too will relinquish my share of the booty to gain possession of Dona Anita's maid, the beautiful Sybil, whom I have long loved, and who always spurned me as if I had been born with the venomous fangs of a viper. Let her, too, be conveyed to our vessel in safety, that I may compel her to be mine! Her beauty shall be my share of the plunder!'</p> 
               <p>'Your request, Yarra, is reasonable-it but hark! what shall be so; and now--what is that? I hear a rushing sound!' exclaimed the chief.</p> 
               <p>A pause for a few moments ensued. There was but a light wind blowing, and they knew it was quite impossible that they should be in the vicinity of breakers. The sound became more and more distinct each moment!'</p> 
               <p>'Forward, there!' cried the chief; 'any thing ahead?'</p> 
               <p>'Nadir vista!' (nothing see,) was the response.</p> 
               <p>Another brief pause ensued, during which their ears were startled by the striking of two bells, in sharp tones, and responded to by two strokes of a deep-toned one!</p> 
               <p>'By San Malo! 'tis some ship! striking the hour of one! We must keep a bright look-out! Forward there!'</p> 
               <p>'Ay, ay, sir!'</p> 
               <p>'Keep a good look-out to windward!'</p> 
               <p>'Tis one-why don't you strike!' said he, turning to the man at the helm.</p> 
               <p>The helmsman struck the bell twice, and a response quickly came from the bell forward.</p> 
               <p>'Sail ho!' cried out a man who was standing in the larboard fore rigging.</p> 
               <p>'Where away?' instantly demanded the chief.</p> 
               <p>'On the weather quarter! standing directly upon us!' was the reply.</p> 
               <p>Blackwing turned his eye in the direction indicated; a huge, towering mass, looming up through the misty gloom, met his gaze. It was a large ship, with all canvas spread and squared, coming down majestically upon them, as if unheeding the rakish looking little craft in such close proximity, under her starboard bow.</p> 
               <p>There was not a moment to be lost. For a moment all was life upon the deck of the schooner, and, in spite of Blackwing's great anxiety, he gave his orders with energy and decision.</p> 
               <p>'Helm hard a-port!' he cried; 'let go the main sheet! let fly the lee topsail brace! haul away on the weather topsail brace! Steady your helm!'</p> 
               <p>These orders were obeyed with alacrity, and the little craft wore away before the wind, just in time to prevent the huge hulk from crushing her beneath her ponderous keel! As it was, the starboard bow of the ship, grazed along the slightly projecting guard, and carried away her larboard cathead; and had not the schooner heeled upon her star-board side, by the rushing of the men to that side, she would have lost her upper spars and become fouled in the ship's lower yards and rigging. They, however separated, immediately after the collision, when the characters of each vessel could be distinctly seen from the other's deck!</p> 
               <p>'A Pirate!' was the terrible exclamation of every officer and man on the deck of the ship.</p> 
               <p>'A merchantman, by all that's fortunate! and a d--d Yankee, too!' cried Blackwing, drawing his cutlass, and brandishing it over his head with as much glee as if every stroke in the impalpable air, cleft a Yankee's head from his shoulders. 'All hands on deck! pipe to quarters! We'll make the<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6943-00000031"/> white-livered cut-throats pay dearly for the loss of our cathead!'</p> 
               <p>The shock of the collision had aroused every man below from their slumbers, and they had leaped from their hammocks, terrified with fear! In a moment afterward, they heard the summoning cries, and quickly rushed up the hatchways! Perceiving the position of affairs, their fears turned to exultant joy, and they took their stations at the guns, ready to commence a murderous work!</p> 
               <p>'Prepare for giving the Yankee a broad-side, my hearties!' cried the chief, just to let him know that we can not only bark, but bite too! Run out the larboard guns! give it to him across the spar-deck! now then! all ready! fire!'</p> 
               <p>The gloomy scene for a moment was illuminated by the brilliant flashes of the guns, and the welkin shook with their bellowing report. The crashing of the bulwarks 'of the ship, and the agonizing shrieks of human beings, told something of the terrible effects of the broadside.</p> 
               <p>'Hell's blazes!' shouted Blackwing; 'that is the way to give it to the accursed Yankee! You've touched him in a sensitive spot! I think we'll waste no more powder upon him for the present.'</p> 
               <p>The blood-thirsty chief now seized his trumpet, put it to his lips, and leaping upon the taferel, hailed-</p> 
               <p>'Ship ahoy!'</p> 
               <p>'Helloa!' came a voice from the quarter-deck, after a short pause.</p> 
               <p>'What ship is that?'</p> 
               <p>'The Emerald!'</p> 
               <p>'Whither from and whither bound?'</p> 
               <p>'From Canton, bound to Boston.'</p> 
               <p>'What is your cargo?'</p> 
               <p>'Teas, silks, and fancy articles! what schooner is that?' questioned the American, in turn.</p> 
               <p>'The Hellhound! Captain Beelzebub! with a crew of one hundred picked men from the Pit of Tartarus' was the satanic reply of Blackwing. 'Send your boat aboard!'</p> 
               <p>You have just destroyed our long-boat! Our yawl was recently stove in a severe gale of wind!' was the reply of the merchant officer.</p> 
               <p>'Then heave-to! Be lively about it, and we'll condescend to board you!'</p> 
               <p>'What do you say?' queried the merchantman.</p> 
               <p>'Heave-to, d-n quick! or I'll blow you to h-?'</p> 
               <p>The ship, as soon as it was possible, come up into the wind, while the schooner did the same, laying along the larboard side of her victim. The buccaneers, armed with cutlasses, pistols and boarding-pikes, to meet any possible resistance that the merchantman's crew might make, stood ready for their chief's command.</p> 
               <p>'Boarders away! follow your chief!' cried Blackwing, as if he were about to meet a formidable foe, instead of less than an ordinary merchantman's crew, entirely unarmed, not so much as a pike, a sword, or a pistol among them all.</p> 
               <p>The sanguinary monsters clambered up by the main channels and gangway, and leaped upon the ship's deck, without even a show of resistance. Indeed, there were less than a dozen men to be seen, including the captain and second officer. The bloody villains absolutely looked disappointed, to find that they could not enjoy the pleasure of cutting their way through scares of Americans.</p> 
               <p>Blackwing, as soon as his feet rested on the ship's deck, raised his cutlass to cut down a sailor, who stood near the gangway; but the fellow whom he would have slain, uttered an exclamation in Spanish, and the fatal blow was withheld. A few words, in good Castilian, were interchanged, when the chief, with a detachment of his own men, were ordered to follow Yarra, with instructions to spare the live of every Spaniard of the merchant-man's crew, but to slaughter, indiscriminately, all others.</p> 
               <p>The massacre quickly commenced. Some were cut down with cutlasses, while others were shot with pistols held within an arm's length of their bodies.</p> 
               <p>The Spanish sailors, who were exempted from the massacre, were pinioned and escorted aboard the schooner; but among the number was a genuine Yankee sailor, who fortunately was blessed with black hair, and dark skin, and who could speak the Spanish language with tolerable accuracy and fluency. He also had, luckily, passed himself off previously, among his Spanish shipmates, as a genuine native of old Spain. He had, too, assumed the name of Marco Condoza, though his real name was Jethro Strong and was a native of the old seaport town of Marblehead, Massachusetts, where he had lived until he was twelve years of age, since which he had been a sort of cosmopolite, or rather, it may be said, that the ocean was his home, and when he ventured ashore, it was only to make a brief visit, for e had taught himself to believe that the perils of the land were greater than those of the wide domain of King Neptune. He was once set ashore at Malaga, where the brig to which he belonged put in, in distress, and was afterwards condemned as unseaworthy. Here he was compelled to remain some three months, waiting for an opportunity to ship on board of an American vessel, but failing in this, he shipped aboard of a Spanish felucca, and after one or two short voyages, he finally succeeded in getting a berth aboard of a fruit-trader, bound to New York. During his intercourse with Spaniards, he acquired their language, which had the effect to sadly impair his knowledge of his own vernacular. To this episode in his adventurous roaming, he owed his life on this occasion. Being regarded as a genuine Spaniard, he was transferred with the real ones to the Albatross.</p> 
               <p>While Yarra was performing his sanguinary mandate, Blackwing, followed by some six or eight of his ruffians, had commenced murdering several passengers on the quarter-deck, the captain being reserved for the purpose of extorting from him the whereabouts of the treasures of the ship. He then entered the cabin, and beheld kneeling upon the floor, in an attitude of prayer, a beautiful female of not more than eighteen years of age.</p> 
               <p>'Seize this charming creature! said he to his miscreants, 'and convey her to my state-room, but do her no harm. 'Beauty and booty must have protection.'</p> 
               <p>'Approach me not! lay not a hand upon me!' she exclaimed, rising to her feet, with a keen-edged dagger in her hand, which she raised as if to strike it to her heart.</p> 
               <p>'Mar not, fair lady, that soft, white bosom! Thou shall not be harmed!' said Blackwing who saw determination in her anger-lighted eyes.</p> 
               <p>'Oh, spare! spare my child!' implored Captain Manville, the merchantman's commander, who, upon hearing the voice of his beloved daughter, broke away from the ruffians who had been ordered to guard him, and rushed franticly into the cabin. 'Take my life! But oh! murder not my child!'</p> 
               <p>'Father,' said Minna Manville, with womanly dignity; 'plead not of these inhuman creatures for my life! I cannot, I will not survive thee, to be dragged away alive by these friends!'</p> 
               <p>'Spare us those unpleasant epithets,' said Blackwing, assuming a mild tone of voice; 'for thou dost greatly disparage our real characters. Both of thy lives are necessary to me, therefore banish all fear from thy mind. Comrades, away with them both to the cabin of the Albatross!'</p> 
               <p>Resistance were worse than useless; and, finding they were to be removed together, acquiescence was the only alternative. The captain's arms were then pinioned, and he was led, with his daughter clinging closely to him, to the deck of the Emerald, thence to the Albatross. The chief followed them to the cabin, where, on questioning Manville as to the cargo, and gaining correct information as to which parts of the vessel the most valuable portions of it were stored, he returned to<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6943-00000032"/> the ship, and with his men, commenced the work of plunder.</p> 
               <p>The hatches were removed, and boxes and bales of rich silks, valuable India shawls, and other costly articles, were hoisted out and transferred to the schooner's deck, then snugly stowed away below. In the cabin, trunks, drawers, boxes and desks were broken open, and a large amount of gold and silver, in bars and ingots, precious stones, besides gold and silver plate, Chinese curiosities, and a great variety of rare valuables, were discovered, and added to the more bulky kinds of plunder. A good supply of wines and spirits, and the cabin stores of the merchantman, were also made secure, together with the captain's chronometers, quadrants, charts, books, etc., which were highly prized by the chief, as the schooner was sadly deficient in nautical instruments, and other means for correctly navigating among the islands of the Gulf and the Atlantic.</p> 
               <p>For eight hours did the buccaneers diligently work in plundering their first prize, and after setting her on fire, they abandoned her, cast off the grapnels, and cleared from the burning ship as quickly as possible.</p> 
               <p>A thick mist yet hovered over the ocean, and in a few minutes they lost sight of the Emerald altogether. It was now two bells in the forenoon watch; a strong wind sprang up, and it commenced raining violently, and continued until eight bells, (meridian,) when the heavy clouds broke way, and the sun again smiled upon the ocean.</p> 
               <p>Having obtained an observation, Hawk-wing laid his course toward the Smugglers' Isle, which he determined, if the wind held good, and the weather proved auspicious, to make that night; and to carry out, while the crew were in the right mood, his horrid intentions towards those who had inflicted so severe a blow upon the piratical crew in the very outset of their new career. His burning love, however, for the fair Anita, was stronger than his desire for vengeance.</p> 
               <p>At six bells in the afternoon watch, the Spanish prisoners, who had been spared the fate of their shipmates, aboard the Emerald, were ordered to appear before the buccaneer chief, who stood upon the quarter deck, with Yarra, and two other subordinate officers, by his side.</p> 
               <p>'My countrymen! for I learn that you are all Spaniards,' 'we need not tell you that we are a band of Free Rovers!-your own eyes have witnessed enough to assure yourselves of our real character. I am well aware that Spaniards love an adventurous life; and I know also that their love of life is so great, that they prefer even a state of bondage to death. For these reasons, and that of having a sincere love for my countrymen, your lives have been spared, while every one of those d--d hateful, villanous Yankees have been made food for ravenous sharks! Now, my purpose in addressing you, is simply this; We need men! fearless, resolute, flint-hearted, determined, adventurous men! In brief, we need Spaniards! they make the best, the truest corsairs, of all the world! I know, by your physiognomies, that you are just the kind of men we desire to swell the number of hand. How say you, my countrymen, will you join us?'</p> 
               <p>The prisoners looked at each other with doubt and embarrassment depicted upon their countenances, and apparently each waiting for another to speak.</p> 
               <p>'Do you hesitate to give us an affirmative answer?' questioned Blackwing, impatient at the hesitation of the prisoners. 'We shall not longer use the tongue of persuasion. If you refuse, know thy doom! Behold!' and he pointed his fingers towards the 'death plank,' which had been rigged out at the gangway, while the prisoners attention had been given to the chief's harangue.</p> 
               <p>'Grant us but one hour to consult together, ere we decide?' requested one of the prisoners.</p> 
               <p>'Not five minutes!' sternly replied Blackwing.</p> 
                
               <p>'Before deciding, captain, we should like to have the privilege of making one request,' said Jethro, alias Marco.</p> 
               <p>'Let it be a reasonable one, then; I shan't stand upon mere trifles,' returned the chief.</p> 
               <p>'Speak-what is your request?'</p> 
               <p>'That no harm shall befal Captain Manville and his daughter, whose lives I have heard are yet spared!' said Jethro, with an air of confidence.</p> 
               <p>'In the event that you become our comrades, and conform to our rules, their lives shall be spared, and they shall not be injured while in my keeping,' promised the chief.</p> 
               <p>'He promises fairly, shipmates,' said Jethro, addressing his companions. 'What say you, shall we turn Pi-Free Rovers I mean, or shall we be chucked overboard on that plank, and become sharks'-meat?'</p> 
               <p>'There was one response in favor of the former.</p> 
               <p>'You must take a solemn oath before joining the Corsairs of the Caribbean Sea!' said the chief.</p> 
               <p>'Prescribe the oath; we will bind ourselves by it,' said one of the genuine Spaniards.</p> 
               <p>The black ensign, with the coffin emblazoned upon it, was brought to the quarter-deck, where it was unfolded to their view.-Each man was required to place his left hand upon the flag, and his right hand upon a naked sabre, while an oath, with the most hellish penalties was administered. This ceremony being concluded, the strangers were hailed as brothers, and received the congratulations of the crew.</p> 
               <p>During the dog-watch, Hawkwing called Fermosa, a young Spaniard, whom he had appointed first lieutenant, and Yarra, into the after cabin, where a long consultation was held. The chief matter in hand was in arranging the premeditated attack upon the Smugglers' Isle, which, as the wind was fair, they expected to reach in from two to three hours. It was a clear, beautiful evening, and they were lighted on their way by the queen of night, and the countless host of stars. The ocean was quite smooth, and the gentle breeze wafted the speedy craft along at the rate of six or seven knots.</p> 
               <p>'Every thing looks auspicious for to-night,' said Fermosa.</p> 
               <p>'Ay, to-night,' responded Yarra.</p> 
               <p>'To-night, then, let it be!' said the chief; 'now go and carefully select the men; have the small arms and ammunition prepared; let nothing be neglected than can contribute to our complete success.'</p> 
               <p>'Trust us, chief; nothing shall be left undone,' replied Fermosa, and he went on deck to give his orders, followed by the second officer.</p> 
               <p>The chief, in their consultation, had been so intent upon arranging the plans of the expedition which they had so much at heart, no allusion had been made to Captain Manville and daughter, who were permitted to remain together, undisturbed.</p> 
               <p>Four bells (10 o'clock) struck, when the Albatross made the southerly point of the Smugglers' Isle, and after taking soundings a few cables' length outside of the reef, they found good anchorage ground, hove-to, and dropped anchor.</p> 
               <p>At six bells, the two boats, manned with twelve men each, put off for the shore, which they reached in safety, and after the men had landed, one of the boats returned to the schooner and brought in eight additional, making the number thirty-two in all. One division was commanded by Blackwing, and the other by Yarra, Fermosa being left, with the remainder of the crew, with instructions to despatch more men ashore, should the boats be sent off for that purpose. Among those in this expedition, were quite a number of the new Spanish recruits, including the spurious Spaniard, Jethro Strong, who by his extraordinary zeal and activity, inspired confidence among his comrades in the expedition, as well as in the officers.</p> 
               <p>Through orange groves, fields of sugarcane, and other tropical products, they proceeded slowly and cautiously on their way,</p> 
               <pb n="68-69 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6943-00000033"/> 
               <p>On reaching the little bay, they halted, for the purpose of making a reconnaissance. Silence reigned in the vicinity, and no lights were visible at the stone villa, nor in the huts of the negroes. Everything seemed auspicious for the enterprise, much to the apparent delight of the invading party. The Pirates congratulated each other upon the certainty of securing treasures unfold, while their chief thought more of the prize so nearly in his grasp-the beautiful, the voluptuous maiden of the Isle.</p> 
               <p>Prior to following the invaders farther on their ruthless expedition, let us know more of those, who were soon to be attacked, and to whom no mercy was to be shown.</p> 
               <p>The evening, as we have before said, was a delightful one; the waxing moon yet shone brightly above the horizon, and the diamonds of the sky lent their serence rays to give beauty to the scene. So inviting was the night, that it had enticed forth the mistress of the isle, together with her American guest, accompanied by several attendants, on an equestrian excursion; and it was about one hour prior to the landing of the buccaneers, that they reined up their steeds, on a point of land at the extreme southerly portion of the island, for the purpose of gazing upon the moonlit sea, and the starry expanse above. Our heroine and her interesting guest were indulging in a lively, agreeable conversation, when a warning sound came upon their ears. It was like that made by the quick running out of a cable.</p> 
               <p>'Hark!' forcibly whispered the young stranger.</p> 
               <p>They listened for a few moments, and strained their eyes seaward.</p> 
               <p>'I see nothing,' he continued, 'and yet I can hear sounds, which certainly proceeds from some vessel in the offing. Hark, again! I heard a voice! There! that sounds like the lowering of a boat by the davits tackle! I cannot be mistaken, there is a vessel some-where in this vicinity!'</p> 
               <p>Our heroine immediately ordered one of her slaves to climb to a higher point of the bluff, which commanded a wider view of the ocean than the spot on which they stood.</p> 
               <p>The slave quickly obeyed, and soon returned with the startling information, that a vessel resembling the Albatross lie moored just outside of the great reef! and that he believed they were manning boats to send ashore.</p> 
               <p>'Is there any lauding place in this vicinity?' asked the young stranger.</p> 
               <p>'Not that I am aware of,' was the reply of his fair companion; 'there is a narrow sand beach just below you cliff, yet I never knew that a boat would be safe to venture to reach it from the sea.'</p> 
               <p>'Depend upon it there is mischief brewing,' said he.</p> 
               <p>'Then it were wise for us to return hastily, and prepare to meet our enemy, if he dare to surprise us,' advised the maiden.</p> 
               <p>'By all means,' acquiesced the youth.</p> 
               <p>The horses were put to their utmost speed, and in a very few minutes afterwards, were given into the hands of the grooms at the door of the villa. To Sybil, whose cautiousness and shrewdness were well known, was entrusted the charge of summoning the entire force of the isle. Noiselessly she tripped along from hut to hut, and commanded the inmates, in their much loved mistress's name, to muster without delay before the villa, and on leaving their huts to extinguish every light therein.</p> 
               <p>The slaves, both male and female, who were capable of bearing arms, obeyed with the utmost promptness. Weapons and ammunition were once more put into their hands, and they were again ready, with willing hearts, to encounter any danger in the defence of their queenly mistress. The women were stationed behind the barricaded casements of the villa, while the men took up a position behind a stone wall, beneath the verandah, running its entire length, about breast high, and which had been purposely constructed as a means of defence to the main edifice.</p> 
                
               <p>
                  <figure> </figure>
               </p> 
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6943-00000034"/> 
                
               <p>The utmost silence was commanded, and as there were no lights visible on the premises from the outside, it looked more like a deserted mansion than a sort of a castle prepared for a vigorous defence. Sentinels were stationed at the several approaches to the villa, with instructions to leave their posts, and hasten back to the house, on the first indications of the enemy's approach.</p> 
               <p>It was a little past the hour of midnight, when the piratical invaders left their resting places on the margin of the little bay, and crept cautiously by different routes toward the mansion, and entered the garden. Terrace by terrace was surmounted, until they reached the sloping lawn directly in front of the verandah, when upon their hands and knees they dragged themselves stealthily along, like so many vipers, all converging towards the wide flight of steps leading to it.</p> 
               <p>At a concerted signal every man rose to his feet! and stood n line, awaiting their chief's commands to rush up the steps and make good their way into the villa.</p> 
               <p>'Forward men!' was the word which was passed along the line in a whisper.</p> 
               <p>One step only had they advanced, when the sharp crack of a pistol was fired from behind the stone-wall, and one of the buccaneers was stretched at full length upon the grassy plat! This, however, was only the signal for a volley of musketry from the same source, which made considerable havoc among the party of assailants! Such a reception they did not anticipate, and those who had not paid the forfeit of their temerity, precipitately retreated down the first terrace, where Blackwing and Yarra succeeded in rallying them. Dividing their forces, one party, under Blackwing, made a desperate rush for the verandah, which they succeeded in gaining, not without considerable loss, however, for the casements were suddenly thrown open, and a brisk fire of small arms was opened upon them! The assailants had reached the main entrance, and commenced battering down the barricaded door, with axes, brought by several of the men for the purpose. For some time it resisted their efforts, and the pirates gained the great hall of the mansion, lighted their torches, and commenced searching for those of the enemy, who had fired from the casements, but not a soul could be discovered; whither and how they had fled remained to them a mystery!</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, Yarra and his detachment had succeeded in forcing themselves with desperate determination; but the latter fought with courage and equal determination. Hand to hand, and sabre to sabre, each fought for victooy! The contest was nearly equal, when a voice cried out from one who had not as yet participated in the conflict, saying-</p> 
               <p>'Now's your time, messmates! Remember the Emerald! Death to the Prates! down with the bloody butchers!'</p> 
               <p>The speaker, who was none other than Jethro Strong, the pseudo Spaniard, followed by two others, who felt by no means bound by the obligation forced upon them by the pirates, rushed into the thickest of the fight, and took part with the Islanders, and their blows fell thick and fast upon the bloody villains, who had mercilessly butchered their comrades. Jethro performed wonders with his good sword: perceiving two of the assailants, one of whom was Yarra, endeavoring to cut down a young man, who appeared to act as the leader of the Islanders, he rushed to his assistance, and warded off a heavy blow of a cutlass, which, had it fallen, would have cloven the youth's skull! It was, indeed a timely interference, and each having but one to engage, the wretched miscreants were quickly made to bite the dust! They then turned to assist in engaging the other buccaneers, but they were seen, making a hasty retreat in the direction whence they had come!</p> 
               <p>The other party of pirates, under Blackwing, after examining every room below, ascended a flight of stairs, which led to the roof of the edifice. The door was fastened,<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6943-00000035"/> but they soon succeeded in battering it down, and upon the flat roof they encountered their feminine foes, most of whom became so frightened at the close proximity of the ruthless villains, that they laid down their arms, crying for mercy! The remainder, however, fought valiantly. Anita and Sybil, having discharged their fire-arms, had recourse to their swords, which they used with considerable effect, but both were finally overpowered. A stalwart negro seized Sybil in his arms, while Blackwing seized Anita. They succeeded in bearing them down to the main floor, and were about to drag them forth by the front door, when the whole party were confronted by those who had defeated Yarra's detachment, headed by the young American, who, striking Blackwing a blow, caused him to relinquish his burden. Another desperate hand to hand fight ensued, which resulted in the defeat of the buccaneers, although several made their escape, including their chief, though receiving several wounds in the melee! The negro, who was endeavoring to bear Sybil away, received a ball through his brain, from a pistol aimed by Jethro, and he fell lifeless to the floor, while the quadroon escaped unharmed!</p> 
               <p>The severe conflict was over. The victory was won by the Islanders. The few pirates, who escaped alive, finally reached, the Albatross to tell the story of their disastrous defeat!</p> 
               <p>'To whom are we indebted for this timely succour?' said Dona Anita, to her youthful guest.</p> 
               <p>'To this brave man!' replied the young stranger, taking the honest, brawny hand of Jethro, whose conduct had been fully recognized by the Islanders.</p> 
               <p>'Well,' said Jethro, 'it makes no odds who you set it down to, for I calculate we all did our best; but I hope never to see the rocks of Marblehead again, if I ain't about as tough an enemy as them etarnally, rascally, blood-spilling varmints have got, this side o' kingdom come! I'd like, jest for the sake o' humanity, to condemn the whole unmarciful mess to walk through the streets of old Marblehead once! Ghosts and witches! wouldn't the boys rock 'em! Wouldn't they sarve 'em wuss than they did- <q>

                  </q> Or worse than Stephen, they tell about in the big book, who was 'rocked' to death!-Oh! if my old captain, and that sweet little daughter of his, were only out of their clutches, make a spread-eagle of me, if I wouldn't dunce a Marblehead hornpipe to the tune of 'The Devil's Dream!"</p> 
               <p>'I should be pleased to hold some conversation with thee in the morning,' said the fair mistress of the isle, meanwhile, consider thy-self one of our most honored guests.'</p>

               <head type="sub">BLACKWING AND HIS LIEUTENANT. THE ALBATROSS FALLSIN WITH THE PIRATICAL SCHOONER FIREBRAND, UNDER JOSE VALDEZ. COMPACT BETWEEN VALDEZ AND BLACKWING. REMARKABLE ADVENTURE OF THE SMUGGLER KING;-HIS SUCCESS.</head> 
               <p>DEFEATED, mortified, and suffering from severe wounds, which he had received in the desperate conflict, Blackwing, with the remnant of the expedition, reached the Albatross. He was conveyed to his berth, where for two long weeks he lay lingering between life and death, and watchfully attended by a faithful slave, who felt a real compassion for his master for having once saved his body from being ground to atoms within the destructive jaws of an alligator. For several days it was thought the chief could not recover, but his vigorous constitution finally triumphed over the king of terrors. Meanwhile, the schooner under the command of Fermosa, had been buffeting the waves of the Gulf of Mexico, and although many merchantmen had been descried, there seemed no disposition to attack any of them. The Pirates felt themselves weak in numbers, and as they had a large amount of undivided wealth, and a large supply of provisions, liquors and small stores, they preferred their present life of luxurious ease, to the dangers and hardships of battle, more especially, perhaps, in consequence of the fact that most of their enterprises had been disastrous and bloody in the extreme, having thus far lost the greater part of their comrades.</p> 
               <p>On the sixteenth day after the island adventure, Blackwing appeared on deck, sufficiently recovered to resume the command of the schooner. The crew were all piped on deck, and it was found that their entire force numbered but twenty-two effective men. A long consultation now took place, in which all were permitted to have a voice, as to what course they should pursue for the future. Without a large accession to their numbers, it was argued, that it was useless to continue their buccaneering career with safety, for it was well known that most of the ships carried a larger crew than they could muster, and that most of them carried a considerable armament, especially Indiamen. Under this view of affairs some of the men favored the plan of going to the free starts of America, make a division of their ill-gotten wealth, and disband. Others were disposed to proceed to a well known piratical haunt on the coast of Cuba, under the chieftaincy of a renowned buccaneer. others suggested the plan of assuming the character of a merchant vessel, enter the port of Havana, and there choose a deputation to wait upon the Governor General, and betray to him the island rendezvous of the Smuggler King and his men; ask for a sufficient force to go and take possession of the isle, and its treasures, make prisoners of its inhabitants, and convey them to Havana for execution.</p> 
               <p>This latter idea accorded well with the views of Blackwing, and he inwardly rejoiced to hear the suggestion come from one the crew. He felt that it was perfectly feasible; and it was a glorious means not only for wreaking his vengeance upon the hated Smuggler King, but through it there was a reasonable probability that, after all, his burning passion for his lovely daughter might yet be gratified. He argued strongly in favor of this timely proposition, and it would undoubtedly have been very generally acquiesced in before the consultation ended, had not the man at the masthead reported a sail in sight. After the usual enquiries were made and answered, as to the appearance of the sail, her course, &amp; c., Fermosa leaped into the rigging, and by the aid of his glass, made out a two topsail schooner, on their lee-quarter, close-hauled, and carrying every rag of sail that would draw.</p> 
               <p>'What does she look like, Fermosa?' asked the chief.</p> 
               <p>'I make her out to be a large schooner,' replied Fermosa.</p> 
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6943-00000036"/> 
               <p>'Perchance it may be one of the vessels of the squadron of our great enemy, the Smuggler!'</p> 
               <p>'No-she carries two topsails and tow t'-gallant sails,' replied the lieutenant; 'no vessel of our old master has such a rig.'</p> 
               <p>'Two topsails!' repeated Blackwing; 'then she, like ourselves, carries the black flag of the Free Rovers! I never knew a two-top-sail schooner that was not either a buccaneer or a slaver! No simple trading-craft ever dares to carry such a rig, for fear of being over hauled by some of the government cruisers. What is her course?'</p> 
               <p>'She appears to be beating to windward, and is now, like ourselves, on the starboard tack, but lying more closely into the wind,' replied Fermosa.</p> 
               <p>'Then we must be on the look-out for her,' said Blackwing; 'she may be some craft that we might not like to fall in with. See that every piece of canvas be close-hauled Fermosa; send men aloft to unfurl the t'gallant-sail' and gaff-topsail; hoist the flying jib, and see that every thing is trim for a race; with our present project, it were well to keep clear of that stranger.</p> 
               <p>The lieutenant saw that his commander's orders were executed, and then took his post on the quarter-deck.</p> 
               <p>The Albatross quickly felt the force of the expansion of her snowy-white wings, and she began to cleave the foam-capped billows at a much increased speed.</p> 
               <p>'Look again, lieutenant,' said Blackwing; 'examine her closely.'</p> 
               <p>Fermosa again leaped into the rigging, and ascended to the cross-tress, and after taking a long survey at the distant sail, through the glass, he descended to the deck.'</p> 
               <p>'She is what I first made her out to be,' said Fermosa; 'a large two-topsail schooner.'</p> 
               <p>'But you have not yet reported whether she is an armed vessel or not?' said the chief, with an anxious, enquiring look.</p> 
               <p>'She has no less than ten port-holes on a side,' answered Fermosa, who as a little inclined to be petulant, on account of so soon being divested of his brief command; 'and I mistake not, two small guns upon her quarter-deck, and one heavy gun forward, mounted on a pivot!'</p> 
               <p>'Diablo! a powerful craft!' exclaimed the chief. 'Does she appear to have a full complement of men?'</p> 
               <p>'Ay, Senor; her deck appears to be alive with men; and if she has as many more below. she is a full match for any sloop-of-war that floats'</p> 
               <p>'As I'm a true Spaniard, Fermosa, that schooner carries the black flag,' said Blackwing; 'and, moreover, is commanded by the buccaneer chief, Jose Valdez! known as young Blackbeard, son of the world-renowned Pirate of that name. How sails she with the Albatross?'</p> 
               <p>'She is much more speedy, and gains upon us rapidly,' seplied Fermosa; 'she was on our quarter when first descried, and now she is nearly abeam!'</p> 
               <p>'Then we may as well make a virtue of necessity,' said Blackwing; 'she is sure to overhaul us before dark, and then we shall be entirely at the mercy of this somewhat capricious buccaneer.'</p> 
               <p>'What do you propose to do?' asked Fermosa, not precisely comprehending the chief's meaning.</p> 
               <p>'Thou art dull and somewhat curt, to-day my dear Fermosa,' said Blackwing. 'In our present weak condition we are at the mercy of the first enemy that chances to fall in with us. Now, as I happen to know something of the character of Jose Valdez, our best course is, to bear boldly down for him, offer to enlist under conditions, of course, advantageous to ourselves. He would much prefer our friendship to our enmity, and had much rather have us for an auxiliary than destroy us.'</p> 
               <p>'The stranger gains upon us fast,' replied Fermosa, 'and we shall soon be within range of her guns; whatever we do it should be done quickly.'</p> 
                
               <p>'My mind is made up,' said Blackwing; 'give her a little more sheet, lieutenant; helm a-port! steady!'</p> 
               <p>These orders being obeyed, the schooner was now going free, with the wind abeam, while the two-topsail craft still hugged the wind as closely as possible, thus shortening the distance between the two vessels much more rapidly than before.</p> 
               <p>Some thirty minutes elapsed, when the stranger fired a shot from one of her waist-guns, and a moment afterwards, a dark looking ensign rolled out upon the breeze from the peak of the mainsail. Blackwing took the glass and examined the design emblazoned upon the flag, and giving it into the hands of his lieutantant, remarked-'Just as I expected-'tis the famous Corsair!'</p> 
               <p>Then stepping forward, and assuming the appearance of one very much surprised, he exclaimed to his crew.-</p> 
               <p>'By the imps of h-I, boys! that flag displays the skull and cross-bones! It is the emblem of Jose Valdez, the young Black-beard! the most powerful buccaneer of all the seas! What's to be done? We cannot run away! We must either join him, or fight him!'</p> 
               <p>The men were almost amazed at hearing the announcement that they were almost within the grasp of the great Corsair, and they gazed hesitatingly from one to another, almost trembling with dread!</p> 
               <p>'Fear not, boys!' at length said Blackwing. 'Valdez hath many noble qualities! he will gladly accept us an ally! Speak-we have no time for parley-shall we show fight, or shall we show our desire to join him!'</p> 
               <p>'Join him! join him!' was the unanimous response of the crew.</p> 
               <p>As soon as the decision was made, Blackwing returned to the quarter-deck, and ordered a short to be fired astern of the stranger, which being done, the black ensign, with the coffin, was run up to the peak, while a white flag was displayed from the fore truck.</p> 
               <p>A signal was now made from the formidable stranger for the Albatross to heave-to which has promptly complied with, while the Fireband-for this was the name of the two-topsail craft-came up into the wind, and then stood on the larboard-tack, until she came within speaking distance of the Albatross, when se commenced taking in sail and hove-to.</p> 
               <p>'Schooner ahoy!' bellowed a deep-toned voice from the quarter-deck of the Fire-brand!'</p> 
               <p>'Helloa!' responded the sonorous voice of Fermosa.</p> 
               <p>'What craft is that, which thus boldly declares herself our rival?' demanded the same heavy voice.</p> 
               <p>'The Free-Rover Albatross!'</p> 
               <p>'Who is her commander?'</p> 
               <p>'Blackwing! Chief of the Buccaneers of the Antilles!</p> 
               <p>'Whither bound?'</p> 
               <p>'Cruising with the hope of falling in with the celebrated Rover, Jose Valdez!'</p> 
               <p>'What business have you to transact with Valdez.</p> 
               <p>'We had purposed to join his squadron, if we were so fortunate as to fall in with him. What schooner is that?' questioned Fermosa in turn.</p> 
               <p>'The Firebrand! commanded by Jose Valdez! just returning from a cruise!' was the answer of the bellowing voice.</p> 
               <p>'The identical chief, which our commander desires an interview with,' said Fermosa.</p> 
               <p>'My compliments to Senor Blackwing; the interview he desires shall be granted; let it take place, forthwith, in my cabin!'</p> 
               <p>The lieutenant, Fermosa, ordered a boat to be lowered, and brought to the gangway, while his chief went below to attire himself in proper costume for the visit. But a very few minutes elapsed, when Blackwing, attired in a costume, characteristic of a freebooter, with a slouched hat and black, waving plume, appeared on deck! His face was bloodlessly pale, and his dark, sombre costume, added to the almost death-like appearance<pb n="76-77 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6943-00000037"/> ance of his features. Yet his form was erect, and his step firm, and, despite the pallor of his countenance, there was a resolute, inflexible expression in his compressed lips, knitted brow, and stern gaze. With unusual dignity he stepped from the gangway into the stern of the boat, waved his hand, and eight about rowers soon propelled the little craft alongside the Firebrand. With the same dignity, he mounted the gangway, when a broadside of heavy guns was fired, which seemed powerful enough to rend apart the stout ribs of the Firebrand!'</p> 
               <p>'Welcome, Senor Blackwing!' said an athletic individual, with the same deep tones, which was heard from one craft to the other, and whose thick, shaggy beard, covered his face to the cheek-bone, and hung down over his full-ribbed chest. 'Welcome! thy raven plume tells me that thou art the chief, Blackwing!'</p> 
               <p>The two chiefs hands were immediately grasped in a cordial embrace.</p> 
               <p>'Blackwing is the name by which I am know,' said the commander of the Albatross; 'and you are--</p> 
               <p>'Jose Valdez!' said the other; 'but sometimes called Young Blackbeard, because I wear more beard, and a blacker one, than my comrades; and, I may add, for a still better reason-my mother always swore that Blackbeard, of old, was my father! But, whether he was or not, I have avenged his death an hundred times, on the Americans, who, tradition says, were his executioners! But come, walk into my cabin-thou shalt mess with me to-day, if I have to fight with thee tomorrow!'</p> 
               <p>Thy descended the companion-way into the gorgeously finished and furnished cabin of the Firebrand, where they seated themselves on luxurious divans, their arms propped by downy cushions.</p> 
               <p>'Thou lookest pale, brother chief!' said Valdez.</p> 
               <p>'I have but just recovered from several wounds received in battle, and from a fever which followed,' replied Blackwing.</p> 
               <p>'Then have I just the medicine that shall cause the color to return to thy cheeks again,' said Valdez. 'Boy,' he continued, addressing a Greek youth, at hand, 'bring hither a flagon of that rich wine of Hungary; that which was intended to moisten the lips of the Viceroy of Mexico, but which happened to fall into the hands of one who can better appreciate its marvellous excellence.,</p> 
               <p>The boy tarried not to listen to the whole of his master's speech, for he had judgment enough to understand that the latter part of it was intended for the ear of the guest. He soon returned with a massive silver salver, bearing a rich golden flagon and a pair of golden flagon and a pair of golden goblets, which he sat before the chiefs, upon a table.</p> 
               <p>'This will mend thy health more rapidly than all the drugs known to the practised physician,' said Valdez, as he filled the goblets to the brim with the rich, sparkling liquid. 'Now for a sentiment-Success to all Free Rovers!'</p> 
               <p>'Except contrabandists,' said Blackwing.</p> 
               <p>'Yes, with all my heart! responded Valdez; 'the trade of smuggling is a sneaking contemptible business. Give me the independent, bold, fearless freebooter, who claims the seas as his fields for plunder, rather than once who cheats the exciseman of his dues. In a word, I hate smugglers!'</p> 
               <p>'Not worse than I do,' replied Blackwing; 'for it has been my ill fortune for years to be domineered over by one who assumes the high-sounding title of the Smuggler King!'</p> 
               <p>'Dost mean Don Fernando de Azvedo, of whom we have heard so much?'</p> 
               <p>'The same.'</p> 
               <p>'I regard him as my rankest enemy, although we have never met; I simply hate him, because his notoriety for adventure rather eclipses mine.'</p> 
               <p>'And I hate him for a far different reason,' said Blackwing; 'and no hate exceedeth mine.'</p> 
                
               <p>
                  <figure> </figure>

               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6943-00000038"/> 
                
               <p>'I infer that thou hast recently deserted him?' queried Valdez.</p> 
               <p>'True; and with three score men at my back; and with us we took a gallant vessel, well armed. We afterwards attacked his famous island haunt, and had it not been for several new recruits who turned traitors at the time of the assault, we should have captured his island paradise, and forever destroyed his power!'</p> 
               <p>`'Tis not too late now to destroy it,' remarked Valdez.</p> 
               <p>'No, Senor; it is for that very purpose, I have sought thee out,' resumed Blackwing. 'Thy fame and power have long been familiar to me. I determined to seek thee out; ask thy cooperation; and if our crew and vessel can be allied to thy squadron as we are at present organized, and enjoy a fair share of the booty and other immunities as enjoyed by all under thee, we can lead thee to the Smuggler's secret haunt, capture the isle, take possession of the immense treasures there stored, and thus forever cut off the Smuggler from the power he now wields with such an arbitary sway.'</p> 
               <p>'By my father's spirt, which visiteth me nightly,' answered Valdez, ' thy request shall be complied with! But tell me more of this isle which you but now termed a paradise.'</p> 
               <p>Blackwing thereupon gave a minute description of the Smuggler's Isle; set forth in glowing colors its natural beauties, and dwelt particularly upon its remarkable adaptation for the peculiar purposes of a piratical rendezvous, and of its great natural advantages for defence. Valdez paid marked attention to the description, for the very idea of possessing such a spot filled him with enthusiasm. The interview lasted for nearly three hours, which resulted in a strong alliance being concluded between them, Valdez making every reasonable concession to Blackwing that he dared to ask for.</p> 
               <p>Elated with joy, at the success of his visit to the Firebrand. Blackwing returned to the Albatross, and communicated to his crew the advantageous terms upon which an alliance was formed with the much dreaded buccaneer chief, Jose Valdez. He presented to them the character of this individual in a much more agreeable light than that in which they had been accustomed to view him, and commented so favorably upon the position they would ever hold in the band, that the crew, with loud huzzas, ratified the negotiations.</p> 
               <p>The two vessels now here away, sailing in company, for the old Cuban haunt of the buccaneers under Valdez, for the purpose of fitting out an expedition for the much coveted isle, which Valdez had so much set his heart upon. In three days they arrived; three other vessels of Valdez' squadron were already in port, after a three months' cruise, and the remaining two vessels were daily expected. Valdez, without communicating his intentions to his band, busied himself in making plans for the expedition, and in super-intending the fitting of it out. Blackwing was his constant companion and his only adviser, and quite a strong friendship soon grew up between them, which continued until a fatal hour which separated them forever.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile the buccaneers are preparing for their grand adventure, let us not lose sight of our old friends, the Smugglers, whom we last saw off the Cuban Isle, watched by Gonzala, from a tower of the Moro Castle.</p> 
               <p>Instead of sailing directly for his island home, as it was the Smuggler King's intention prior to his adventures in the city of Havana, he turned the prows of his vessels eastward. This change in his action was in consequence of certain papers which had fallen into his hands, of so important a nature, that he deemed it his imperative duty to proceed to Europe. In sixteen days his three vessels arrived off the Spanish coast; and in the night time, Don Fernando, under the assumed name of Don Enrique de Carrera, accompanied by three of his most faithful followers, left his squadron in a boat, and landed at a small fishing inlet. They immediately penetrated<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6943-00000039"/> trated into the interior, and before daybreak arrived at a rustic village, where, having purchased horses, they set out for Madrid. attired as Spanish cavaliers. They reached Madrid without interruption, where having secured, quarters suited to their dignity, the arrival of Don Enrique do Carrera, alias our old friend Don Fernando de Azvedo, alias the Smuggler King, was duly announced at Court, on an embassy from the Spanish West India Isles. The next day our bold adventurer presented himself at the palace, and requested an audience of Hid Most Christian Majesty, which was readily granted, and he was, with due ceremony; ushered into the presence of the monarch, and his prime minister, Don Carlos de Valentia. The king received the embassador as became a monarch, and then intimated to his minister that the business of the embassy was open to him.</p> 
               <p>A large sealed packet, containing a variety of papers, was placed in Valentia's hands, who broke the seal, and commenced the perusal of the papers.</p> 
               <p>'Sire,' said the minister, 'here is a document which relates to the noble Marquis de Villefana, of whom, we but yesterday received sad tidings. It was rumored that he was murdered by a band of Smugglers!'</p> 
               <p>'May I ask if that report did not proceed direct from His Excellency, the Governor General of Cuba?' enquired Carrera.</p> 
               <p>'Such is the fact,' answered Valentia.</p> 
               <p>'Permit me to say in the most deferential manner,' said our adventurer, 'that Gonzala hath reported that which he knows to be totally false! The Marquis was murdered by a band of Cuban pirates!'</p> 
               <p>May his soul rest in Peace!' devoutly said the king crossing himself.</p> 
               <p>Valentia then proceeded to read audibly the paper, which disclosed the precise circumstances of Villefana's death, as already known to the reader. The facts which were set forth were so well authenticated by the testimony of several persons, and sworn to before competent authority, that the king and his minister were satisfied that Gonzala had reported an untruth.</p> 
               <p>'By my crown!' said the king, 'this famous Smuggler spoken of in the narrative, hath done us good service in defeating those bloody buccaneers, and saving the galleon from their plundering hands.'</p> 
               <p>The next document read was that of the contract, duly signed, sealed and attested, between the Governor and the Smuggler, which the former, in his haste to get out of the latter's clutches, had left behind him. Then followed an account of Gonzala's treachery in surrounding the Smuggler's quarters with soldiers, with the intention of arresting him. Following this, was read a confession of the Smuggler in relation to his assuming the title and character of the Marquis, detailing al the adventures and hair-breath escapes during his last visit to Havana.</p> 
               <p>This confession proved quite a diversion to the king, and he laughed heartily at the assurance of the outlaw, and the ingenious manner in which he had so many times outwitted the Governor-General.</p> 
               <p>'By my royal ancestors!' said the king, 'I would give much to see this Smuggler!-'What manner of man is he?'</p> 
               <p>'He is ambitious, proud and somewhat <choice>
                     <sic>arbitary</sic>
                     <corr>arbitrary</corr>
                  </choice>; he is brave and generous, and hath an honest heart,' said Carrera.</p> 
               <p>'Honest, didst thou say?' queried the king.</p> 
               <p>'Can a Smuggler be honest?'</p> 
               <p>'I said, sire, that he hath an honest heart,' replied the embassador, 'and never would he have been guilty of an illegal act, had not the unjust decrees of Gonzala stamped him as a felon, and stole from him not only his good name, but his estates!'</p> 
               <p>'By the sword of justice, this matter shall be thoroughly looked into,' said the king; 'I feel already interested in this outlaw; what is his personal appearance?'</p> 
               <p>'In stature, lofty,' replied Carrera, drawing up his noble, commanding figure to its full height. 'Those who do know the Smuggler and myself, I have heard say, that we do much resemble each other; and I think, sire, that I may venture the remark, that I am neither a small, nor a feeble looking personage.'</p> 
               <p>'By the club of Hercules!' exclaimed the monarch, taking a survey of the stalwart, athletic personage before him,' if he hath a jot more of thy stature, or seeming strength, we no longer wonder that he is the formidable character he is said to be; and if he hath so open and manly a countenance as thine, and we say it without flattery, he is as honest a man as you have represented him to be; but Gonzala hath always described him as a very devil incarnate!'</p> 
               <p>'If he doth not prove himself, sire, in any aspect, a better man than he who misruleth over your West India possessions, set me down as a knave, and punish me according to a knave's deserts.'</p> 
               <p>Valentia continued the perusal of the papers, and one document set forth the actual condition of the Cuban treasury, and showing Gonzala a defaulter to the government to an immense amount. There were also other documents which set forth many iniquities practised by him during his long administration, both of a public and private nature, and which called loudly for redress. In fact, the testimony against Gonzala was overwhelming, and the king, already in his own mind, had decided on deposing him.</p> 
               <p>'By our divine sceptre! methinks the days of Gonzala's rule over Cuba, will be few,' said the king, addressing his minister.</p> 
               <p>'Yes, sire,' replied Valentia; 'there can but little doubt that it would have been well to have recalled him long ere this. I should advise that a commissioner, with large discretionary powers, be forthwith despatched to Havana.'</p> 
               <p>'It shall be so,' said the king; 'the nature of the case imperatively demands it; and we have some suspicion that Gonzala hath connived with the buccaneers, otherwise they could not have so long infested those seas without being captured by the armed force that the Governor hath at his disposal.'</p> 
               <p>'True, sire, he hath had cruisers sufficient along his coast to utterly annihilate them,' said Carrera; 'but he either dared not attempt it, or, what is most probable, that he receives tribute from them for protection in their ruthless career. In fact, the greatest enemy the buccaneers have found in the West Indian archipelago, is the power of this same Smuggler King, of whom those despatches frequently speak; and it is furthermore known to me, that he hath offered to Gonzala to put an end to piracy in those seas if he would but withdraw the ban of outlawry, and restore him to his former position.'</p> 
               <p>'What was Gonzala's reply?' asked the king.</p> 
               <p>'It was, that he required of him no such service; but,' continued Carrera, 'he offered to restore the outlaw to his rights, if he would put his treasures, which he is known to possess to a large amount, into the private coffers of Gonzala.'</p> 
               <p>'Monstrous!' exclaimed the king. 'By my royal ancestry these things shall not go unpunished!'</p> 
               <p>'It were well, sire,' suggested Valentia, 'to annul the proscriptive edict against Fernando de Azvedo, if he hath the power to exterminate those sanguinary fiends, who infest your seas, and prey upon the commerce of all nations; besides, I have ever entertained the opinion that the Cuban governor committed a series of great wrongs upon Azvedo, upon the mere shadow of the pretence that he was a conspirator against the government.'</p> 
               <p>'What sayest the Cubans to Gonzala's proscription of Azvedo? asked the king.</p> 
               <p>'Those, sire,' replied Carrera, 'who were cognizant of the facts, know and do not hesitate to say that he was wrongfully accused in the outset; but even if the charges could not have warranted such severity of punishment.'</p> 
               <p>"Twas many years ago, and we had quite<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6943-00000040"/> forgotten the matter,' remarked the king. 'If we remember aright, Azvedo was much esteemed, before these misfortunes.'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, sire,' replied Carrera; 'and he doth lack hosts of warm and powerful friends in the isles even now!</p> 
               <p>'Dost thou know how he may be communicated with?' asked the monarch.</p> 
               <p>'Yes, sire,' replied Carrera; 'it ever lies not in my power to acquaint myself with his whereabouts.'</p> 
               <p>'Wilt bear a communication to him?'</p> 
               <p>'I shall esteem it as a high honor, if it be from your majesty,' answered Carrera.</p> 
               <p>A brief consultation, apart, now took place between the king and his minister, which resulted in the preparation of a document, to which was appended the signature and seal of the king, also the signature of Valentia. This was entrusted to Carrera, to deliver, if possible, in person to Don Fernando Azvedo, to whom it was addressed.</p> 
               <p>Carrera then withdrew, highly elated with his mission to the king;-and, in twenty-four hours document, which so much interested him, in the cabin of his favorite schooner, the Ions, which vessel's prow was now turned towards the setting sun, followed closely by the Sparkler and the Brilliant, the two other schooners of the contrabandist's lucky squadron!</p>

               <p>SOME eighteen days had elapsed, since the Smuggler King, with his little squadron, had sailed from the shores of Old Spain. He was once more approaching the West Indian archipelago, when, one morning, at daybreak, in lat. 17, lon. 21, the Ione fell in with a large ship, with her t'gallant-masts and upper yards gone, the fore topsail and mizen course hanging in shreds from the yards, and the maintopsail, close-reefed, was set to the breeze, though partially split in twain. this was the only canvas that gave propulsion to the huge hulk, with the exception of a tattered staysail. A signal of distress was flying from a shroud just below the main cross-trees, which gave the only indication that the ship was not entirely deserted. There was but a gentle breeze blowing, and the strange vessel was sailing or rather floating upon the waters at a snail-like pace, with her prow directed northwardly, though varying from due north to north-east. The lookout of the lone, from aloft, reported that not a single living thing was visible upon her decks. This fact excited the curiosity of Don Azvedo, and he immediately gave orders to approach her more closely, for the purpose of ascertaining the actual condition of the ship, though he had a fearful presentiment as to what had been the fate of the crew. The Ione ran abreast within pistol shot distance; Don Fernando mounted the taferel, and thro' his trumpet, shouted as loudly as possible,-'Ship ahoy! ship ahoy!' Thrice he repeated the hail, when a small, shrill voice responded from the ship, and a youth, apparently not more than fifteen years of age, made his appearance on the quarter-deck, rubbing his eyes with his hands, and looking bewilderingly around for the source of the bellowing shout which had awakened him from a sound slumber, and to which he had respond with a wild 'halloa!'</p> 
               <p>'What ship is that?' cried the Smuggler King.</p> 
               <p>'The American ship Emerald!' replied the youth.</p> 
               <p>'Whiter from, and whiter bound?'</p> 
               <p>'From Canton, bound to Boston!'</p> 
               <p>'Why is the deck so deserted? were are the officers and men?'</p> 
               <p>'I am the only MAN aboard,' answered the stripling of fifteen, with all the assurance of manliness, and after a moment's hesitation, he added: 'the captain, officers, crew and passengers, have all been cruelly murdered by pirates!'</p> 
               <p>'By San Cristoval! I apprehended that such was the fact,' remarked the Smuggler to one of his officers; 'but it is surpassing singular that a crew of piratical demons should have spared one to tell the tale, and not have scuttled or burnt the vessel!'</p> 
               <p>The Smuggler again hailing the ship, he gave the fifteen-year-old man to understand that if he could bring the ship up into the wind, he would run alongside and offer him such assistance as he desired.</p> 
               <p>'What are you?' demanded the boy.</p> 
               <p>'Contrabandists,' replied the Smuggler; 'but always ready to lend a helping hand to honest vessels in distress!'</p> 
               <p>'You speak like an honest man,' said the cautions boy; 'you're sure you are not pirates?'</p> 
               <p>'Our word must be taken that we are not, and our actions shall convince thee that we speak truly. We thee no harm, and only good.'</p> 
               <p>'I believe what you say,' returned the boy, 'but if you should deceive me, unprotected as I am, I have the power to blow the ship to atoms, and will do so, if you attempt to injure me or the ship!'</p> 
               <p>Azvedo smiled at the threat, coming as it did from a beardless boy, and he was pleased at the resolute, determined manner in which it was uttered.</p> 
               <p>'Fear not, my young gallant!' be replied. 'Heave-to, and we'll run alongside, so that we can all be blown up together, if we are found to be other than we have declared!'</p> 
               <p>The boy ran to the helm, and removing the lashings, he by his own exertions, succeeded in bringing the partially dismantled craft up into the wind.</p> 
               <p>The Sparkler and Brilliant now coming up, they were signalled to heave-to, the Ione run alongside the ship.</p> 
               <p>The Smuggler was the first to board her, and his surprise was increased, to behold, in the only living object visible on that deck, a fair-complexioned boy with a mild, sunny blue eye, with golden locks hanging about his shoulders, and a form of exquisite proportions. So handsome a youth, thought the Smuggler King, his eyes never beheld, and from that moment, he felt that he would protect that boy, even at the sacrifice of his own life. He looked around the deck, and saw that it was stained with human gore, and that about the main hatch there were certain indications that the ship had been o fire! He spoke to the solitary being, who was regarding him with an eye of intense interest, and enquired how it was that he should be found alone, in a large ship, upon the ocean.</p> 
               <p>A flood of tears now burst from the eyes of the boy, and it was many minutes ere he could speak. Azvedo encouraged him by words of sympathy, and promised him to afford him every assistance in his power. The boy at length wiped the tears from his beautiful, and with a voice, almost choking with utterance, essayed to speak.</p> 
               <p>'You see in me, sir, the only one of all this ship's company whom the pirates did not cruelly murder!'</p> 
               <p>'What pirates?'</p> 
               <p>'I know not.'</p> 
               <p>'Didst hear who was their chief?' asked the Smuggler.'</p> 
               <p>'There was a leader whom I heard called Blackwing.'</p> 
               <p>'Blackwing!' repeated Azvedo, thoughtfully; 'in all these seas, I never knew the existence of a buccaneer so styled. Was it not Blackbeard?'</p> 
               <p>'I am certain that I heard the name of Blackwing and none other,' replied the solitary youth.</p> 
               <p>'It is not important by what name they go; they are fiends-all! But tell me, my brave lad, how is that you were spared from sharing the fate of thy companions?'</p> 
               <p>'When these merciless creatures first boarded the ship,' replied the boy, 'and commenced' the massacre of my shipmates, I ran<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6943-00000041"/> below and hid myself in the hold, where it was impossible that they should discover me, or reach me, unless they removed most of the cargo, for the place in which I crept, being between some heavy boxes, was so narrow that no full grown person could have crowded his body into it. There I remained for several hours, until certain that the pirates had done their work and left the ship; then I cautiously crept from my hiding place, and went on deck. The moment I got there, I saw to my horror and amazement that the vessel was on fire, and that the flames were already bursting up through the main hatch. The pirate vessel was no longer within sight, for the fog was very dense at the time. I knew now that either the ship was to be my funereal pyre, or that I must trust myself to a plank, where the ocean must inevitably, sooner or later, be my grave. Around the deck, the mutilated remains of my comrades were lying, the blood still flowing from the death-wounds that they had all received.-While I was meditating what was to be done, it commenced raining, the wind sprang up, and in a short time it fell in such torrents that I saw that it began to quench the fierceness of the flames. Now, for the first time, the thought suddenly flashed upon my brain, that the fire might possibly be quenched altogether. Seizing a bucket with a lanyard, I went diligently to work drawing water from the sea, and dashed it upon the flames. For more than an hour I fought the fire, and with the aid of the rain, which fell unceasingly during the whole time, I had the satisfaction of seeing my efforts crowned with success-the ship was saved from burning! Night soon came on, and as the rain subsided, the wind commenced blowing a gale. The ship was hove-to at the time, and being almost exhausted with fatigue, I went below and soon fell asleep. Towards morning I was suddenly awakened by a loud crashing noise upon deck-I ran up the companion-way, and saw that all the light spars had been carried away by the force of the tempest; the ship was laboring hard, and sails and rigging were flapping and flying loosely. The sea was running high, and it seemed as if total destruction was to be the inevitable fate of the Emerald. Morning at length dawned, and the elements wore a more cheerful aspect; the wind subsided, the waves dwindled to mere ripples, the sun's beams struggled thro' the clouds, and all was once more blue above and blue below. I immediately set to work in unbending such of the sails as were torn to shreds, and in coiling up and making fast the loose rigging, and casting adrift the spars which were hanging to their fastenings and being dragged alongside of the ship.'</p> 
               <p>'Thou must have toiled diligently,' said Azvedo, patting the youth upon the head; 'but tell me, how many days have passed since the pirates attacked the ship?'</p> 
               <p>'This is the eighteenth!'</p> 
               <p>'Dios de Cielo! eighteen days!' ejaculated the Smuggler; 'alone upon the ocean eighteen days on board of a large ship!-It seems almost incredible! in storm and in calm thou hast managed to keep her afloat?'</p> 
               <p>'No; an all-merciful Providence, whose aid, day by day, I have invoked, has guided the ship thus far in safety,' replied the youth.</p> 
               <p>'I marvel that the ship is in such good condition as she is,' remarked the Smuggler.</p> 
               <p>'After getting her round before the wind, I lashed the helm, and as there has been but a gentle breeze all the time since the storm, I have had time for eating, sleeping and passing the remainder of my time by doing all the labor my strength would permit, sometimes aloft and sometimes on deck. I assure you that I have got on much better than I could have believed I had the power to do.'</p> 
               <p>'Wonderfully well,' replied Azvedo; 'but how didst thou dispose of the murdered bodies?'</p> 
               <p>'I sewed them carefully in canvas, pieces of the tattered sails, and buried them in the sea,' replied the boy; 'but before I cast them overboard, I read a burial service over each one, from our late captain's prayer-book. I then washed and scrubbed the deck as cleanly as I could, but it was impossible to wash out those blood-stains!'</p> 
               <p>'Marvellous!' exclaimed the Smuggler;-'the history of thy acts ought to be handed down to the latest posterity. Hast no sail been visible since that fatal day?'</p> 
               <p>'Several times I have, through the glass, discovered mere specks or the extreme verge of the horizon, which I supposed were ships, but they came not near enough to discover my situation.'</p> 
               <p>'What is thy age?'</p> 
               <p>'Most sixteen.'</p> 
               <p>'Thy speech indicates many more years,' remarked Azvedo.</p> 
               <p>'Oh, sir, I have had a good school-boy's education, and I have seen very much more of the world than most boys of my age.'</p> 
               <p>'No one could doubt it. In what capacity didst thou serve on board of the ship?' questioned the Smuggler.</p> 
               <p>'I was a passenger, but sometimes did the duties of cabin-boy,' was the reply.</p> 
               <p>'Dost think that all the passengers and crew were massacred?'</p> 
               <p>'I know not whether any were taken away alive or not,' replied the youth; 'but I did not discover among the slain either the bodies of Captain Manville or his daughter, Minna; and what seemed most strange to me, was the fact that among some fifteen or eighteen Spaniards of the Emerald's crew, not a single one did I discover among the killed, but the body of every American lie there, with the exception of a Marblehead man, who sometimes passed himself off for a native of Spain, and he talked and looked as much like a Spaniard as any one of them did.'</p> 
               <p>'Didst ever expect to get this ship into port without assistance?' asked the Smuggler.</p> 
               <p>'I knew not what to expect. I thought that by directing the ship's course northwardly, I should before many days get upon the coast of the United States' coast, where my distress signal would be soon descried by some one of the many vessels homeward or outward bound on that coast, and there be boarded, and assistance promptly and cheerfully rendered me.'</p> 
               <p>'A slender hope, my dear boy, but I admire thy courage and manliness in never giving up to despair, and in doing all that mortal man could have done, under the remarkably peculiar circumstances, in endeavoring to save thyself and ship. Now,' continued Azvedo; 'I cheerfully offer to render the every assistance in my power; I have the means to save the ship and thee, and will do so, if the Almighty power will permit me. Wilt put thyself under my protection?'</p> 
               <p>'Many thanks for your seeming kindness,' answered the youth. 'I think you look not like a man who would wish to do me harm, or to take the ship from me; you look not like one of those--'</p> 
               <p>'No, believe me, my boy, I am no buccaneer,' finishing what the youth had upon his tongue's end, and reading clearly his thoughts, 'though I must confess my career has been somewhat irregular. If it be thy wish, I will put a crew of men aboard the ship, and take her into the port whither we are bound, which with a moderate breeze we can make in two or three days. Once there, the ship shall be refitted without delay, and despatched forthwith to her destined port.'</p> 
               <p>'I perceive that all your vessels carry guns and many men,' remarked the youth, casting his eye suspiciously towards the little squadron.</p> 
               <p>'Arms and men are essential to the trade in which we are engaged,' replied Azvedo, 'and that trade, as I told thee before, is that of smuggling, an illegal and not very honorable occupation under the usual circumstances attending illicit trade; but my case is an unusual one, and in my opinion, I am perfectly justified in pursuing it. But, nevertheless, it is my most ardent desire to be-friend thee; indeed, I cannot consent to leave thee in the condition in which I have discovered thee.'</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6943-00000042"/> 
               <p>There was such frankness, nobleness and generosity in the manner of the stalwart Smuggler, that the boy's suspicious gradually changed into confidence, and he yielded himself and the ship to his care.</p> 
               <p>From his three vessels he immediately drafted a crew of able-bodies, active seamen, and, selecting officers in whom he had implicit confidence, the ship was put in their charge, with instructions to refit her temporarily, and make the Isle, to which the whole squadron was destined, with as little delay as possible.</p> 
               <p>Some spare spars were sent up and rigged, sails were patched and bent, and other repairs being made, the Emerald was once more in working order, beating to windward, in the track of the Smuggler's three vessels.</p> 
               <milestone n="-" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>The unusually protracted absence of Don Fernando de Azvedo from his island home, naturally created considerable uneasiness, if not alarm, in the mind of Dona Anita. She has been made aware, before he finally sailed, that he was going on a somewhat hazardous expedition; and now, inasmuch as he had exceeded his contemplated term of absence some sixty days, she had fearful foreboding as to his fate. Moreover, she had apprehensions that the infamous Blackwing, not-withstanding the severity of the punishment he had received on two occasions, might augment his force, and return to the Isle to carry out his perfidious designs. To meet this danger, every possible means were resorted to, and among her most efficient auxiliaries, were Jethro Strong, alias Marco Condoza, who had deserted the ruthless corsairs in the heat of the conflict at the villa, and who had contributed so much to the success of the defensive party. Yet the numbers upon the isle were so few, their cause would look desperate, indeed, if the galled sea-marauder should make another descent upon the isle, with reinforcement at his back.</p> 
               <p>Days, even weeks passed away, diligently strengthening and guarding the isle, and watching the ocean for the appearance of both friends and enemies.</p> 
               <p>During her hours of extremest sadness, Anita found much solace in the companion-ship of the young American, who was cast upon the isle during the fierce tornado; whose life and return to his wonted health, he owed to her care and watchfulness; and great as was his gratitude, he had repaid the service, by his brave and efficient services in her behalf. In their morning and evening walks upon the cliffs, or in their mid-day tete-a-tetes beneath the vine-trellised verandah they conversed upon every conceivable topic, except that which lie nearest their hearts.-Many a time was the unrevealed subject nearly approached by one and then by the other, but it would be quickly waived, as if it were dangerous for the tongue to speak that which the heart would have had uttered. Frequent were her solicitations to gain from him his young history; but all the satisfaction that she could gain consisted in this: that he was an American by birth and education, that he was a midshipman in the United States navy, and that the vessel which had gone to pieces on the reef, belonged to the navy of his country. Even his name he suppressed, though he permitted Anita to call him 'Edgar;' and he was soon recognized among all the dependents of the isle as 'Senor Edgardo,' or when addressed personally by them, as 'Mass'r Edgar.'</p> 
               <p>'I know,' said Anita, one morning, as they stood on the highest promontory of the isle and, watching the ocean world before them for specks on the horizon, which might be converted, by aid of a glass, into vessels; 'I know Senor Edgar that they heart yearns for the land of thy kindred-for the home of thy childhood; and had I a ship at my disposal, it should waft thee, were it thy wish, to the free land, which thy words have taught me to love; and then, Edgar,' she added, with half concealed emotion, 'we should part for ever!'</p> 
               <p>'I have an honored father and mother, a much-loved sister, if God hath spared their lives, in the land of my birth,' replied Edgar, as a tear started from his eye; 'but, believe me, Anita, I could not leave this island, even to see them, until your father should arrive, or some succor afforded you, sufficient to protect you from those merciless barbarians of the sea, who might at any time make another descent upon these shores.'</p> 
               <p>'Thou art too kind to me,' said Anita, her eyes sparkling with love and pleasure; 'and if thy strange choice of remaining upon this se-girt isle rather than going hence be sincere, then why dost thou look so melancholy at times?'</p> 
               <p>'Did I not hear words from your lips, that your father, should be return and find a stranger here, and that stranger his daughter's guest, that he would be highly displeased!'</p> 
               <p>'Fear not,' replied the maiden; 'circumstances have dissipated all apprehensions of that nature. My father, and I say it with pride, hath many noble qualities; and when he shall have heard of the stirring incidents which have taken place here in his absence, and of they participation therein, his gratitude will rise far above all other feelings. Be assured, Edgar, thy services will never be forgotten, or go unrewarded by him. He would bestow on thee his vast treasure rather than that thou shouldst not be amply repaid.'</p> 
               <p>'He owes me nothing,' said Edgar; 'his daughter snatched me from the jaws of death. I have done her no service other than that which any honest man would have rendered under the emergencies which have arisen since my convalescence. And yet, great as is my gratitude, he possesses at treasure that I confess my soul covets. 'Tis neither gold, nor silver, nor precious stones.'</p> 
               <p>'Lands, perhaps; slaves thou couldst not covet?' suggested Anita, enquiringly.</p> 
               <p>'Tis neither.'</p> 
               <p>'Tell me, then, Edgar,' said she, hanging upon his arm, and looking with love-beaming eyes into his noble and handsome countenance; 'thou hast much excited my curiosity; and it is but fair and courteous, when a gentleman excites a woman's curiosity, that he should gratify it.'</p> 
               <p>'You would be angry if I were so bold,' he replied, gently taking the hand which rested upon his arm, and meeting her tender, but earnest gaze.</p> 
               <p>'I promise thee that I will not.'</p> 
               <p>'May I frankly speak it?' he asked.</p> 
               <p>'Yes,' she replied, suddenly turning her gaze to the earth, and blushing deeply; 'yes-I am listening.'</p> 
               <p>'Well, then-it is-it is--'</p> 
               <p>'SAIL HO!' shouted a loud voice, almost in the ears of the lovers, and prevented Edgar from saying that which he had essayed to say an hundred times before.</p> 
               <p>They turned suddenly and beheld Jethro Strong within a few paces distance.</p> 
               <p>'Sail ho!' he repeated.</p> 
               <p>'Where away?' eagerly enquired Edgar though he wished the sail and Jethro anywhere just then, except in sight.</p> 
               <p>'East-three points to the south 'ard!' answered the rough Marbleheader.</p> 
               <p>Edgar caught up the spy-glass which was lying at his feet, and looked through it in the direction indicated.</p> 
               <p>'It is a topsail schooner,' said he, while he still gazed; 'close hauled on the starboard tack-I can't make out whether she's armed or not. Ah! now I espy another sail, on the same tack a little farther to the north.' Then taking nearly a half-circle range of the horizon, he again cried out-'I see a third! a little farther south-all schooners, and apparently endeavoring to make the isle!'</p> 
               <p>'I think it must be my father,' said Anita, tremulous with joy. 'Look again-dost see any signal flying?'</p> 
               <p>'Yes,' said Edgar; 'on the windward sail there is a long narrow flag flying!'</p> 
               <p>'It is-it is my father!' cried Anita, with joyous excitement. 'The signal of the contrabandista is long, narrow, and hath a motto upon it.'</p> 
               <p>The maiden now took glass, and surveyed the approaching squadron, and having satisfied herself that they were the long looked<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6943-00000043"/> ed for and long hoped for vessels, she hastened to the villa to order preparations for his reception, leaving Jethro and Edgar on the cliff together.</p> 
               <p>The moment she had got out of hearing, Jethro who had had, as yet, but little conversation with the young man, ventured to address him on a very tender subject, after his own rough and ready style.</p> 
               <p>'I don't blame you a bit,' he began; 'if I warn't upwards of thirty-five, I should like to make love to that beautiful piece of female humanity myself. Cat-heads and davits! how prettily she skims along! there ain't many sich craft as them in the world, and I've seen nigh about the whole of it.'</p> 
               <p>'well, next to a correct eye for a sea-going craft, I can tell pretty night the character of everything that carries petticoats; now that little craft which was lying so snugly under your lee-beam a few minutes ago, is one of the few that I've fell in with, in my day, that an honest man might trust and swear by.-She's well built, staunch in frame, and firm in her upper works. I can see that in her eye. There's no use for any man to undertake to sail in company with her, unless he's an honest cruiser. That's my opinion-now what's yours?'</p> 
               <p>'Mine accords with yours,' said Edgar.</p> 
               <p>'I know'd it-I know'd it-I saw her grappler inside o' yourn,' resumed Jethro; 'and I was glad to see it, because I has a sort of a notion you were made for each other, just the same as one suit of sails is made for a particular set of spars, and nothing suits me better than to see my notions carried out. Now, my friend, just take a look at my bull and my figure head, and see what sort of a craft you can make me out to be?'</p> 
               <p>'If I had not heard you speak,' replied Edgar, 'I could have sworn that you were a Spaniard; 'but, to use a Yankee prerogative, I guess you're an American!'</p> 
               <p>'And I guess you are one, too, by the cut of your jib,' said Jethro.</p> 
               <p>'You have said aright.'</p> 
               <p>'And so have you, my hearty!' exclaimed Jethro, extending his hand; 'give us your grappler! Nothing does me so much good as to take a brave American freeman by the hand!'</p> 
               <p>'What part of the United States do you hail from?' asked Edgar.</p> 
               <p>'Marblehead!'</p> 
               <p>'Indeed!'</p> 
               <p>'Indeed?' repeated Jethro; 'is there anything remarkable in a man's bailing from the respectable old town?</p> 
               <p>'Oh, no,' said the young man, slightly confused. 'I thought it a little singular, because I am a Massachusetts boy by birth.'</p> 
               <p>'And how, in the name of all that's wonderful, came you here?' asked Jethro.</p> 
               <p>'I was cast upon this isle in a tornado,' replied Edgar; 'the vessel went to pieces, the crew perished, and I, the only survivor, was saved by the efforts and kindness of Dona Anita.'</p> 
               <p>'It would have been better for the Emerald and her crew, if a tornado had overtaken her, instead o' them infernal pirates! Well,' he continued, with a heavy sigh, 'she's gone to Davy, and that's an end of her, while here am I, Jethro Strong--'</p> 
               <p>'Jethro Strong?' repeated Edgar; 'I have heard you called Marco Con-'</p> 
               <p>'Avast, there!' interrupted Jethro; 'that is my Spanish name; ye see I'm sort of a mongrel; I set out in the world as a Simon Pure Marbleheader, but I've backed and filled so much among the Dons of late years, that I am no more what I was, than a Bashaw is, after his tails are cut off! But, speaking of the old Emerald, and thinking of that sweet little craft that sheered off from you a few minutes since, put me in mind of a pair of beauties that used to peep out o' the companion-way every morning. One of them, it was said, was the Captain's daughter, and as for the other, I never heard who she was, but, next to Dona Anita, they were the two smartest girls I ever clapped eyes on; I've known the Captain's daughter to take her trick at the wheel in a gale of wind, and as for the other, I've seen her go aloft with the r'yal boy, when it was blowing great guns, furl the main r'yal and send it down; and all this in spite o' the captain's orders to her not to stir out o' the cabin! Them's what I calls smart doings for girls. Halloa, you!' continued the old salt, observing the foremost schooner go about, and stand on the larboard tack; 'perhaps them ain't the old Don's squadron arter all; that schooner's whiffed about, and there go the others.'</p> 
               <p>'There's no landing place on this side of the island,' remarked Edgar, 'and they wish to go to windward of it, so as to make the inlet.'</p> 
               <p>The young man was right; the squadron stood on the larboard tack for about a league, then tacked again, rounded the island, entered the channel between the reefs and sailed safely up with the flowing tide. Foremost, into the little day, came the Ione, with her flags and streamers flying; and on her quarter-deck stood the Smuggler King, and Conrad, his favorite lieutenant, attired in their dress costumes.</p> 
               <p>Upon the shores, with loud huzzas, each vessel was welcomed by the now happy Islanders. As soon as the Ione dropped anchor, an eight-oared barge was manned, and conveyed the Smuggler King ashore, into the midst of his rejoicing dependants. Anita Flew to her noble father's arms, received his affectionate embrace and paternal kiss.</p> 
               <p>He then greeted all the islanders, not disregarding the humblest slave. While these mutual congratulations were going on, Edgar, Jethro, and the two Spaniards, who had deserted Blackwing, made their appearance, and stood silently apart in a group, observing the scene. The Smuggler's eye was soon upon them; he looked toward his daughter for an explanation, but she seemed to hesitate, and her cheeks were covered with crimson blushes.</p> 
               <p>'My beloved child,' said he, 'how is this? those are strangers?'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, father,' said she, 'let me introduce them;' and she beckoned them to advance; 'Senor Edgardo, my father,' she continued, presenting the young man; 'he was wrecked upon the Devil's Reef, and his life was almost miraculously preserved. These three gentlemen,'-presenting Jethro and his two companions-'are deserters from a band of pirates, into whose service they were pressed. During the second attack upon the island, these men deserted, and did as infinite service in repelling those merciless invaders!'</p> 
               <p>'Yon amaze me! exclaimed the Smuggler; 'our retreat then has been discovered! By San Cristoval! there must have been foul treachery at work!'</p> 
               <p>'There has been, father!' said Anita; 'didst not observe our numbers were diminished? that the Albatross was not at her moorings? that Curcamo was not here to greet thee!'</p> 
               <p>'Diavolo!' exclaimed Don Fernando, turning his eye to the spot where he last saw the missing schooner at anchor; 'I see it all now, but on my arrival I. Looked for nothing but thee, my child! Curcamo is the author of this diabolical mischief?</p> 
               <p>'Yes, father.'</p> 
               <p>'Oh! fool was I to trust him!' exclaimed the Smuggler; 'I should have either taken the traitorous knave with me, or shut him up during my absence; but all, I trust, will hereafter go on well; and that our strongest <choice>
                     <sic>desiers</sic>

                  </choice> be in due time accomplished to our heart's content.'</p> 
               <p>'I have had many fears, my father, because of thy protracted absence.'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, my dear child; it was necessary-absolutely necessary. We have been to old Spain, and have seen the king!'</p> 
               <p>'To Spain!'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, my dear; but it is a long story that we have to tell thee, and we must first know all the affairs of the isle. Come, we have no time to lose, for within forty-eight hours we shall again sail on an enterprise fraught with<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6943-00000044"/> the greatest consequences to ourselves, and to the peaceful commerce of the Antilles.'</p> 
               <p>The Smuggler Kind and his peerless daughter, leaning upon her father's arm, immediately proceeded to the villa, where, after partaking of a sumptuous repast, they were closeted for several hours. Anita gave a detailed history of every event that had transpired upon the island, since her father had left her to rule, excepting only, several tender interviews, which might have some what confused her, even if she had possessed the assurance. Having concluded her narrative, the Smuggler King, in turn, described the curious events of his own recent adventures, dwelt particularly upon his daring visit to Havana, and to the court of Madrid, and also spoke of the remarkable fact of his falling in with the ship Emerald, with only one person on board, and that person a boy, which ship he put a crew on board, and that her arrival at the isle might be looked for at any hour after the morrow.</p> 
               <milestone n="-" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>On the day subsequent to the events just narrated, at a distance of seven or eight leagues from the Smuggler's Isle, in a westerly direction, the squadron of the notorious buccaneer, Jose Valdez was lying-to, waiting for the return of night, to make a descent upon the much coveted isle, so glowingly described to him by Blackwing. The squadron consisted of two large two-topsail schooners, with batteries of ten guns each, besides an immense pivot-gun forward, and two swivels aft; also, two smaller schooners, one carrying sixteen, and the other ten guns. These war vessels were efficiently manned, and every thing provided, to make certain of rendering entirely successful the grand objects of the expedition. As great reliance was placed upon Blackwing, the chief, Valdez, had made him second in command of this formidable squadron. The Albatross, which he yet commanded, had been materially strengthened in armament, and a full complement of men had been drafted aboard of her.</p> 
               <p>As this recklessly bold and blood-thirsty wretch stood upon deck, gazing upon that island paradise, which appeared at that distance like a small, uninhabitable rock, he indulged in the exultant feeling, hat ere another morning dawned, the Smuggler's strong hold would be wrested from him, and that his proud, imperious, beauteous daughter, would be wholly, irrevocably his. Moreover, he resolved, with a fiendish smile, that the fair maiden, who was yet his prisoner, and whom he had studiously kept concealed from the vulgar gaze of his uncouth and savage associates, should become his mistress, and yield to his brutal desires. That day, he determined to separate her father from her, even were it necessary to assassinate him in cool blood.</p> 
               <p>'Yes,' said he, soliloguising, 'I'm resolved! I'll delay no longer. I've already too long been thwarted in my purpose. Minna shall be my mistress! Anita shall be bride!'</p> 
               <p>Uttering these threats, he went into the cabin and throwing apart the curtain that separated a small portion of the cabin from the main part, the ruffian stood in the presence of Captain Manville and the fair girl, who had found favor in the libertine eyes of the accursed pirate!</p> 
               <p>'Come forth, Senor!' Commanded Blackwing, as if he were addressing a slave; 'I have use for thee!'</p> 
               <p>'If our lives will satisfy thee, take them at once!' replied the captain.</p> 
               <p>'If thou will not come forth at my bidding, I'll order thee to be dragged hence with a rope about they neck!'</p> 
               <p>'I will not stir hence, unless my daughter accompanies me,' was the determined reply.</p> 
               <p>'By h-l! I'll butcher thee on the spot!' exclaimed the buccaneer, drawing his sabre.</p> 
               <p>'Approach not!' said Manville, undaunted at the savage threat. 'If your advance another step, I'll blow your brains out!' and he produced a pistol already cocked, which by means unknown to the pirate he had obtained possession of.</p> 
               <p>'Yes,' said Minna, producing also a pistol; 'two lives at least shall be sacrificed to atone for ours!'</p> 
               <p>'Ah! pistols!' exclaimed Blackwing with surprise; 'how camest thou possessed of those weapons?'</p> 
               <p>'I will not answer; we have them and will dare use them when the necessary moment arrives!' said the captain in a determined arrives!' said the captain in a determined manner. 'Moreover, let me tell you to your discomfiture, that I have found a treasure more valuable than all the gold dust of the Indies! Behold!' and he raised the lid of a cushion-covered locker on which he had been seated, and displayed to the dismayed gaze of the pirate, a number of red bags, filled with powder, one of which had been ripped open, and the contents scattered, so that the least spark of fire would suddenly ignite the mass. 'This,' continued the captain, with undaunted coolness; 'is my fortress-my Gibraltar!'</p> 
               <p>The pirate started back, and said, with a shudder,-</p> 
               <p>'By the infernal powers! there hath been foul treachery here! Tell me, who is the traitor, and I swear that no harm shall befal thee!'</p> 
               <p>'Villain! I would not trust you under a thousand oaths! But believe me, there is no one of your infernal crew who has given me this power over you and your vessel, in the hour of my weakness! It was providential that it was here deposited, and a divin Providence led us to its discovery! Therefore, merciless monster, beware and tremble, lest I am driven to use my power!'</p> 
               <p>'Thou wouldst not destroy thyself and daughter?' asked the now cowardly pirate chief.</p> 
               <p>'No I would save her from thy brutal hands!' replied Manville; 'one spark of fire will send her, pure soul into the celestial world: and the same spark will send you and your demoniac crew to the fiery pit of Tartarus! there to writhe in torment as you deserve, eternally!'</p> 
               <p>Blackwing trembled at the thought; for he saw 'determination' written upon the countenance of that man, who feared not to summons the angel Death at any moment!</p> 
               <p>'Stay thy hand!' plead the pirate; 'for thy sake, and for the sake of thy daughter; for I here swear that no harm shall befal thee. Moreover, I will--'</p> 
               <p>The promise to be spoken was interrupted by the announcement of the name of his <choice>

Blackwing had but time to draw together the folds of the screen. When down the companion-way stalked the 'young Blackbeard.' Wine was immediately ordered, and after imbibing a few glasses, the two chiefs went upon deck to enjoy a cigar, and talk over the business in hand for the night. As yet, Valdez knew not of the sweet maiden held prisoner by his colleague, and it was fortunate for all, at the time, that he did not; for his well-known impetuosity might have led to such a disaster as would have struck terror to the souls of all on board of the three other vessels of the squadron. The hours of the day passed wearily away, and twilight shades at length came on, all the vessels, and they bore away towards the Smuggler's Isle.</p>

               <p>GREAT as was the distance of the buccaneering squadron from the Smuggler's Isle, Don Fernando had, at the meridian hour, through a powerful telescope, discovered four specks on the extreme verge of the western horizon, and from the fact that they changed not their position during the day, he had well founded suspicions that they<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6943-00000045"/> were neither merchantmen not honest cruisers. He stationed a faithful man on the promontory to watch them, and to report any change that he might discover in their movements, while he actively engaged, in person, in preparing his little squadron for active service, and in looking to the augmentation of the defences of the isle. Three small pieces of ordnance were dragged to the southerly part of the island to command the beach and channel by which Blackwing had once before availed himself of. If, as he supposed, another attack was meditated upon the isle, he determined to make no resistance at the mouth of the inlet, but absolutely permit such of the piratical squadron to enter the little bay as should be designated for that quarter, and there to decide who should remain masters of the isle. If, on the other hand, the whole of the invaders contemplated landing at the southerly point, his vessels would be fully prepared to go forth and attack them while they were disembarking from their vessels, which he was well aware could only be accomplished by the aid of boats.</p> 
               <p>The day wore on in toilsome preparation for the anticipated events of the night. Evening came-it was a truly lovely one; the moon and glittering stars shone out resplendently from the dark azure canopy; the ocean, on which their silvery rays were shed, was calm and peaceful as the slumbers of an infant. During the earlier hours of the night there was a gentle, rippling breeze from the southwest, but towards midnight it fell almost to dead calm, and the ocean became as a mirror of glass, reflecting all above its surface with perfect distinctness.</p> 
               <p>Sentinels were posted along the western and southern shore, and even a boat was sent nearly a league from the isle, in a westerly direction, for the purpose of gaining the earliest intimations that an enemy were approaching; indeed, the almost vigilance was maintained to prevent the least possibility of a surprise in any quarter.</p> 
               <p>A little past midnight, the reconnoitering barge was espied returning with all the speed which eight strong and skilful oarsmen could cause her to skim over the water. The officer in charge of the barge, reported that he had discovered four vessels approaching the island, being towed by two boats each and that they stood nearly in a line, abreast of each other. An order was immediately given to extinguish or conceal every light upon the island, and to exercise as much quietness as possible. The upper spars of the smuggler's vessels had been lowered, so that it was an impossibility, owing to the intervening high land, to discover that any large craft was lying in the bay, until observed after entering it. Soon after the barge had returned, sounds proceeding from the pulling of many oars could be heard quite distinctly. At length, by the aid of a powerful night-glass, Don Fernando saw, looming up in the dim distance, three vessels making directly towards the inlet, and soon afterwards, a fourth vessel, farther to the south, her course being directed so as to round the southerly part of the isle. A few puffs of wind now broke the glassy surface of the ocean, and the noise of pulling at the oar quickly ceased. Anon, the wind increased, so that a fair sailing breeze was blowing, and the vessels were making more rapid progress towards the shore. As soon as the leading vessel reached the mouth of the channel, down went foresail and jib, and the topsail was clewed up and furled to the yard; the rear vessels also reduced sail, and followed, as nearly and closely as possible, the course of the first up the serpentine channel. The tide being almost full, the progress was slow.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, the largest vessel of the buccaneering squadron, the two-topsail schooner Firebrand, still commanded by the chief, Valdez, was piloted around to the opening in the reef, by Fermosa, Blackwing's lieutenant, and came to anchor. Three boats were manned, one after the other, at the gangway, each man being armed with a musket, a pair of pistols, and cutlass. Valdez appointed Fermosa to the command of the boats, and as soon as the order was given to put off for the shore, several guns were fired from the Firebrand, for the purpose of alarming the inhabitants, and thereby creating a diversion which, if it would not call them to that quarter, would draw their attention from the three vessels which were crawling noiselessly into their very midst, and, as the pirates chucklingly supposed, entirely unobserved.</p> 
               <p>The position which the three guns occupied was a favorable one for defence; they commanded the beach and a portion of the channel, and the men had thrown up a breast-work of earth and stone for their protection. This little battery was commanded by Senor Edgardo; this post had been given him by the Smuggler King, at the particular request of Dona Anita. He had thirty men in his command, including Jethro Strong, to whom her had become warmly attached. Jethro acted in the capacity of a gunner, and he stood with lighted torch, ready to obey his young countryman's command.</p> 
               <p>'There they are-full in sight!' exclaimed Jethro; 'they're within reach-shall I toss 'em a belly-full of the metal, just by the way of letting 'em a belly-full of the metal, just by the way of letting 'em know that we are acquainted with their business.'</p> 
               <p>'Be patient, strong,' replied Edgar; 'we don't wish to frighten them away; if you should happen to stave the boat in range, the others might run away. Hold your fire, or your impetuosity may spoil our perfect success.'</p> 
               <p>With long sweeps of the oarsmen, the belligerent forces moved rapidly towards the beach, which, with the exception of a narrow strip, was now submerged by the tide.</p> 
               <p>Edger kept close watch of the enemy, and as the first boat grated upon the sand, he gave the order to fire! The effect was terrible! The gun had discharged, with deadly aim, a perfect shower of cannister and grape, killing at least half of the boat's crew on the spot, and wounding severely several others! Immediately following, another gun was discharged at the second boat, and still another at the third boat, with much less effect, tho' creating considerable havoc. When the three boats' crews finally effected a landing, of the original number that had disembarked from the original number that had disembarked from the Firebrand, but about half the number remained to pursue an enterprise, which they now found was hazardous in the extreme. Desperate in their intent, those who had escaped the slaughter mingled their loud imprecations with the shrieks and groans of the dead and dying.</p> 
               <p>Shielded by the rocky cliff, those who had escaped the cannons' murderous discharges, crept cautiously along until they came to a narrow notch or ravine, through which they hastily passed, and coming up in the rear of the islanders, a desperate hand to had fight ensued. The leader, Fermosa, after having discharged his pistols, and having his cutlass broken close to the hilt, grappled with Jethro Strong, upon the very edge of the Jethro's throwing him over the cliff, and ere his body found a resting place beneath, it was cut and turnip the sharp, craggy rocks which jutted out, in its descent. The battle finally resulted in the almost total discomfiture of the 'pirates! The few who escaped the bloody conflict, endeavored to get aboard the boats, but these were taken possession of by the islanders, and the miserable remnants of the piratical invaders were forced to escape around to the western side of the island, with the hope and expectation that the other and much larger division of the expedition would meet with success and not disaster.</p> 
               <p>Soon another boat, making the fourth, put off from the Firebrand, on board of which the supposition was, that the islanders had been driven from their position, but they had no sooner landed than they were assailed by a volley of musketry, followed up by a dash among them of some twenty of Edgar's party, with such impetuosity, that the buccaneers were thrown into utter confusion, and could make but little resistance. The contest was,<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6943-00000046"/> therefore, a brief one-the pirates were totally annihilated-not one of the fourth boats's crew returned to tell the tale of their bloody defeat!</p> 
               <p>'There's a precious heap of sharks' meat,' remarked Jethro Strong, as he gazed upon the ghastly, gory faces of their slain enemies, by the light of the moon's serene rays'; 'look at that chap, now; he's the one that wanted to have all my Spanish messmates take a walk on the plank! he had a perfect love for killing! he'd go without his breakfast any time to see a man handed over the gangway to a hungry sea-lawyer! He loved to torment his victims, too, 'fore he finished 'em. He said he liked to see how a man looked without a handle to his countenance, so he'd whip off his nose with his keen-whetted butcher-knife; then he'd whip off their ears-he'd save their ears, same as an Injun would save a scalp,-then he'd pry open the jaws and get a bass-hook upon the tongue, and pull it out same as he would a fish out of water! If Old Nick don't give him a good roastin' in his back kitchen, then he is'nt fit to reign over the damned! Then there's that chap with the ugly mug, and only one eye, he's the one--'</p> 
               <p>'Come, come, no more of this, my friend,' interrupted Edgar, who had been eagerly gazing towards the Firebrand; 'we shall have no more men to fight in this quarter, that is certain; her crew must be exceedingly small by this time, and I am inclined to the opinion that they have sent their last boat; a schooner seldom carries even as many as four. Let us now to the bay; our muskets, pistols and sabres may be wanted there.'</p> 
               <p>The detachment, under Edgar, shouldered their muskets, and took up a line of march for the bay, leaving behind four men to act as sentinels.</p> 
               <p>While these events were transpiring, the squadron of three vessels, under Blackwing, was cautiously proceeding up the channel to the inlet. When the report of the guns from the Firebrand reached his ears, the three schooners had passed the points of the channel where an attack was most to be expected, and seeing no sign of the enemy's being on the alert, he indulged in the exultant feeling that the victory would probably be won without the striking of a blow, or the loss of a man!</p> 
               <p>The Ione, Sparkler and Brilliant, commanded by the Smuggler King, were ranged in a line, on the west side of the bay, and in a position that could not be discovered by the enemy, until they had got fairly within the den of the lion. The batteries of the Smuggler were well shotted with grape and cannister; the gunners were all at their stations, and musketeers were stationed forward, on the quarter deck, and aloft on each craft; piles of heavy shot, and small shot in bags, and chain and langrel were piled up amidships in the rear of each gun; indeed, every thing was in the best possible condition to give their foes such a reception as they little expected, but such an one as they most richly deserved.</p> 
               <p>Besides this force, on the north shore of the bay, concealed by stones and trees, were a score or two of men and women, with muskets, under the command of our brave and beautiful heroine, who had implicit instructions how to act under certain emergencies.</p> 
               <p>Onward and boldly came the Albatross, followed by the Flame and the Torch-the names of the other two piratical vessels,-and as each craft merged into the open bay from the narrow channel, the breeze struck their sails and wafted them on with increased speed, so that they all got fairly within, ere they had a suspicion of the formidable character of the enemy they had to cope with.</p> 
               <p>The conflict was suddenly opened by a volley of musketry from the shore, by the male and female musketeers under cover of the wall and thicket. A broadside, from the Albatross, was immediately fired toward the spot where the unseen defenders were supposed to be. The smoke of the broadside, together with having their attention completely drawn to the shore by the attack, they did not yet perceive the armed forced, beneath the dark shadow of the high cliff, actually within range of musketry.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly a succession of blazing flashes illuminated the scene-the roar of three heavy broadsides, rapidly following one after the other, made the welkin ring-the guns, aimed with remarkable precision upon the decks of the stealthy enemy, and mowing down the pirates in scores, added shrieks, groans and horrible maledictions to the terrors of the fight which had begun, so signally in favor of the defenders! While the guns were again being charged, on board the Ione, Brilliant and Sparkler, the musketeers kept up an incessant firing, aided, too, by an occasional well directed volley from the excessively annoying party ashore.</p> 
               <p>So great was the shock of this severely, terrific attack upon the several pirate crews, and so many wretches encumbered the decks either in their death-sleep or writhing in torture, that it was some minutes before the buccaneer leaders could rally men enough to man the batteries!</p> 
               <p>Thrice did the pirates receive broadsides from the smugglers, ere they could discharge a gun from the starboard batteries, which bore upon them, in return; and when it was returned, the pieces were carelessly depressed, and the heavy round shot, with which they were charged, did no very material injury.</p> 
               <p>Like a wounded hyana, Blackwing strode to and fro his deck, cursing and swearing, first at the shots of the enemy, and then at his men for not doing their duty!</p> 
               <p>'Fight! ye hounds!' he cried, 'or ye'll all be in hell before daylight! Up, here, ye d--d infernal skulkers!' he angrily shouted to several men who were seated upon the deck with maimed limbs; 'ye've all of ye a leg and an arm apiece! Up, I say, or I'll blow your cowardly brains out of ye!'</p> 
               <p>But the suffering wretches obeyed not, for their wounds were severe, and they were fainting with the loss of blood! The demon chief absolutely clove the skull of one of these, and would have despatched the others, had not a sweeping discharge of cannister and grape riddled the bulwarks beneath which they were seated, and put them out of earthly misery! Blackwing narrowly escaped sharing their their fate, but he was reserved for one more ignominious.</p> 
               <p>The fight now became general and terrific, and the carnage was dreadful. The buccaneers fought with tiger-like ferocity; the smugglers with coolness and courage. In the midst of the heavy cannonading, the Ione ranged alongside the Albatross, threw her grapnels aboard, and the two vessels sides grated together.</p> 
               <p>'Repel boarders!' cried Blackwing, from the quarter-deck; 'don't let one of the hell-hounds aboard! Fight! fight! like demons, as ye are!'</p> 
               <p>But the enraged chief's impious orders were of little avail. The Smuggler King was the first to leap to the Pirate's deck, and was quickly followed by his well-disciplined and valorous men. With sword in hand, and over the bodies of the slain, our formidable hero made his way to the quarter-deck, where stood the wretch he desired most to comfort.</p> 
               <p>'Ah! miscreant! triator! deserter! I have met thee at last!' exclaimed the Smuggler King, as his sabre clashed against that of Curcamo, alias Blackwing. "Monster! thou most accursed of all villains! thou has dared to bring hither a swarm of beings, accursed of God and man, to beard the lion in his den! it remains for me to inflict upon thee a punishment thou richly deservest!'</p> 
               <p>'I'll not die by thy sword!' said Blackwing, receding a few steps.</p> 
               <p>'But my my sword thou shalt be conquered, and by the common executioner thou shalt die!' coolly replied the Smuggler.</p> 
               <p>'Thy threats are vain, giant as thou art!' exclaimed Blackwing, rushing upon his stalwart antagonist with perfectly frantic desperation.</p> 
               <p>But his former master, with a single dexterous motion of his sword twisted the weapon from the pirate's hand, and it fell over the schooner's stern into the water. Quick as a flash, Blackwing drew forth a pistol, but ere he pulled the trigger, his arm fell powerless by his side, by a blow from behind, and the ball missed its intended mark! In another moment, Azvedo had a slip-noose about his neck, which he drew sufficiently tight to prevent the discomfited chief from doing any mischief. The person who had turned aside of pistol's aim was none other than Minna, who, with her father, had ventured upon deck, at the opportune moment.</p> 
               <p>'Who art thou?' questioned Azvedo, as he looked upon the lovely form of her who had probably saved his life.</p> 
               <p>'Alas, sir, my father and I have for several long weeks been the prisoner of that inhuman monster, lying there!'</p> 
               <p>'Lady, thou hast saved my life,' but stand not here exposing thine own. Go below, until this bloody strife be ended.'</p> 
               <p>The surviving pirates, on board of the Albatross, being no longer urged on in the desperate conflict by their chief, threw down arms and plead for quarter.</p> 
               <p>'Quarter thou shalt have,' said the Smuggler, 'for thou deservest not to die by the sword!'</p> 
               <p>The defeated miscreants, who begged for that which they never gave, were manacled and sent beneath the hatches.</p> 
               <p>The battle still raged on the decks of the Flame and the Torch, which had been gallantly boarded by the crews of the Flame and the Brilliant;-In the midst of the strife, the Brilliant's men were reinforced by the arrival, in two boats, of the detachment under Edgar. These men, who had already won one victory, clambered<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6943-00000047"/> quickly aboard the schooner, and with sabres in their hands, dashed in among a body of pirates, who were contending with demoniac ferocity against the Smuggler's men, who were being hard pressed. The conflict was quickly decided by the gallantry of Edgar's men, and the corsair's black flag lie stained in the purple gore of those who had fought under it!</p> 
               <p>The victory was won-loud huzzas from our hero's men made the welkin ring. Of all that pirate squadron, not more than twenty five yet lived. These were heavily ironed and lying beneath the hatches!</p> 
               <p>Though the battle of the inlet was decided in favor of the Smuggler King, all was not complete. The Firebrand yet held aloft the black ensign, and the notorious corsair, Jose Valdez, yet walked her quarter-deck</p> 
               <p>The Smuggler King, making known the fact, he quickly mustered an efficient force aboard the Ione, and sailed immediately forth to give battle to the Firebrand, which was now lying-to, where we last left her, waiting for the result of the battle, and the return of the boats, and utterly deceived as to the disasters which had befallen the major part of his power. But when Valdez discovered a single sail bearing down upon him, and that sail not one of his own squadron, the suspicion flashed upon his mind that all was not as he had had confidently supposed. He was without boats, and the larger portion of his crew he had sent ashore to aid in the capture of the island, indeed, he had not reserved a sufficient number of men to work the batteries.</p> 
               <p>Ascertaining that the approaching schooner was not of his squadron, and of course an enemy, he forthwith made sail on the Firebrand, and bore away, but the Ione having managed to get the weather-gage, and being the fastest sailer, was close upon him, and began firing langrel and chain-shot, to cripple her top-hamper. The third short carried away the Firebrand's main topmast, and with it of course, her main topsail and main topgallant yard!</p> 
               <p>'By the rocks of Marblehead!' cried Jethro Strong, who had aimed the gun which did the mischief, 'we've made an honest looking craft of her at all events!'</p> 
               <p>'Skilfully done!' exclaimed the Smuggler King; 'that shot has made thy fortune!-'Try him again!'</p> 
               <p>'I should just like to make a fore-and-after of her!' said Jethro, elevating the piece slightly.</p> 
               <p>The gun was fired, and sure enough the fore topmast was cut in two at the cross-trees, and spars and sails went by the board.</p> 
               <p>'Brava! brava!' cried the Smuggler King.</p> 
               <p>'Now I guess,' said Jethro, 'she don't look a bit more rakish than a cape-codder!'</p> 
               <p>The Ione was within gun shot range before the Firebrand opened her battery; but the Ione kept up a continual cannonading, which had the effect the silence several of the enemy's guns after receiving her first broadside.</p> 
               <p>'Prepare for boarding!' cried the Smuggler, as they were coming into too close proximity for working the batteries.</p> 
               <p>The grapnels were thrown and the schooners were side by side.</p> 
               <p>'Down with the hammock netting!' cried Azvedo. 'Boarders away!'</p> 
               <p>Little resistance could be made to the impetuosity of the victorious crew of the Ione, and they quickly had possession of the Fire-brand's almost deserted deck. The flag was struck by the corsair chieftain's own hands, and he now stood upon it, holding his sword by the naked blade, and extending its hilt towards his captor, at the same time asked for quarter. It was granted him, and he submitted to be put in irons, and led below!</p> 
               <p>With his new prize, Azvedo returned to his little harbor, where he was greeted with loud shouts of joy.</p> 
               <p>The fatigues of the night were over, and all the combatants were hushed in sleep, save those who were suffering from the pains of wounds, and those who were suffering keener pangs-the pangs of a guilty conscience.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head> 
               <p>IT was at the sunset hour of the following evening that a group, consisting of Don Fernando de Azvedo, Captain Manville, and their daughters were seated in the verandah of the villa. The captain had just finished narrating the loss of the Emerald, and of his own and daughter's experience on board of the Albatross, when the cry of 'Sail ho!' was heard. A messenger from the lookout on the promontory reported a large ship In sight, bearing down for the island.</p> 
               <p>Don Fernando immediately ascended to the roof of the house, and after taking a survey of the sail, immediately rejoined the group below.</p> 
               <p>'The narrative I have listened to is a strange one,' remarked Azvedo, on his return to the verandah, without making any allusion to the ship in the distance; 'but my daughter hath told me that ye were not the only survivors; that all of the Spaniards of the Emerald's crew were spared, including one American, provided that they would take the pirate's impious oath; that they did so, and that, on the occasion of their first attack upon the island, three of them, including the American, deserted and joined my people.'</p> 
               <p>'I hope that this is true,' replied the captain; 'but as no communication was allowed between us and any person aboard, save the pirate chief, I had not the means of ascertaining.'</p> 
               <p>'Pardon my inquisitiveness,' said Azvedo; 'what evidence is there that the ship was burnt?'</p> 
               <p>'I heard it from Blackwing's lips, and I saw through the cabin windows the flames streaming up amidships,' replied Manville.</p> 
               <p>'Here come the two noble Americans. I had sent for them to join us,' said Don Fernando. 'Two braver men I never saw, tho' one is quite young, but he evinces knowledge and courage beyond his years.'</p> 
               <p>'Surely, my daughter, that is the man who was at one time an American, and at another a Spaniard,' remarked Manville.</p> 
               <p>'It is, indeed, the man Marco, or Jethro, as he was sometimes called,' replied Minna, who arose with her father to greet him.</p> 
               <p>'Rocks and rammers!' exclaimed Jethro, as he was confronted by Manville, 'how in the name of Moll Pitcher and witches generally came you here? Miss Minna, too! Earthquakes and broadsides! I wonder if the day of resurrection hasn't come?'</p> 
               <p>'We are no less surprised and glad than yourself, to behold your face again,' said the captain, cordially grasping the hand of the warm-hearted tar.</p> 
               <p>Dona Anita, as soon as she saw Edgar approaching, she ran forth to give him an earnest welcome, after which they approached the villa leisurely, and joined the party in the verandah.</p> 
               <p>'This is a countryman of thine, Captain Manville, who was wrecked upon our shores,' said Don Fernando, presenting Edgar.</p> 
               <p>Edgar was startled with surprise. They gazed into each other's countenance for a moment, and both trembling with emotion.</p> 
               <p>'Father in Heaven! can I be mistaken?' ejaculated Captain Manville; 'are you not Charles Edgar Manville, of Salem, Massachusetts?'</p> 
               <p>'Father, forgive your erring son!' said Edgar, falling upon his knees.</p> 
               <p>'Fargive you?' repeated the captain, raising the young man to his arms and embracing him; 'forgive you, my long lost son! ay, a thousand times! Now, embrace your sister-Minna, your brother Edgar!' continued the overjoyed parent, presenting him to his daughter, who fondly received his affectionate embrace.</p> 
               <p>'Think not, my friends,' said Captain Manville, apologetically, 'think not that my son has done anything very culpable. Five years ago, he teased me incessantly to permit him to go to sea, but I steadily refused him my consent. One morning he was missing, and this the first time I have seen or heard of him from that day to this, although I used every means in my power to gain information of him. I had every reason to believe, however, that he shipped on board of some merchantman for a distant port.'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, my dear father,' said Edgar; 'my history is a brief one, since I so rashly left a happy home. I sailed from New York in a ship bound to Rio; we were wrecked on a reef of rocks three days sail from our destinod port, and taken off by an American brig of war, bound to Rio, where I shipped on board of the brig which picked us up. After serving in the Navy for three years, I saved a boat's crew from drowning, in the harbor of Norfolk, at the hazard of my own life. The incident was brought to the notice of the Secretary of the Navy, and he forthwith transmitted to me a midshipman's warrant. Four months ago I was examined by a board of officers, and was raised to the post of Passed Midshipman. Immediately afterwards I was ordered to join the brig Eagle, bound to the Pacific coast. She was wrecked on this isle, and all perished, save myself; and my life I owe to this lady Senorita Anita de Azvedo.</p> 
               <p>'And twice since has he has rescued me from imminent peril!' added Anita.</p> 
               <p>'Heaven bless you, lady,' said Manville; 'but Edgar, tell me, why did you not return home?'</p> 
               <p>'It was my ambition, dear father, to return with at least one epaulette on my shoulder, that you might not feel ashamed of your son, and the more readily grant him forgiveness for his unfilial conduct.'</p> 
               <p>'Ah, my son, little did you know your father's heart;' continued Manville; 'had you returned like the prodigal son, all should have been forgiven and forgotten.'</p> 
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6943-00000048"/> 
               <p>This happy interview continued at a late hour in the evening, and the singular coincidences which had brought the several parties were explained in detail. The only matter of utmost importance to Captain Manville, the remained unrevealed, was the Smuggler King's secret in regard to his falling in with the Emerald, which vessel had actually anchored off the island, and a boat was momentarily expected at the landing in the bay.</p> 
               <p>As the midnight hour approached the boat arrived, and two officers, accompanied by a boy, were seen coming towards the villa. As they were ascending the flight of steps, Don Fernando was there to greet the lad, and he embraced him as warmly as if he had been his only son.</p> 
               <p>'Captain Manville,' said Don Fernando, taking the lad by the land, 'I think I have another surprise for thee. Thou knowest this brave boy?'</p> 
               <p>The youth looked downward, and had the bright rays of the sun, instead of the pale moon's light, illumined his countenance, a crimson blush would have been visible on his fair checks.</p> 
               <p>'I don't recognize in him any one that I know,' said Captain Manville.</p> 
               <p>'Not know my dear cousin?' calculated Minna, throwing herself into the arms of the youthful person. 'Not know your niece, Geraldina!' and the two cousins kissed each other violently, at the same time giving vent to a joyous flood of tears.</p> 
               <p>'Heaven be praised!' said the captain, as Geraldina, in her masculine habillments, received the cordial embrace of her uncle.</p> 
               <p>'I thought to give thee a great surprise, captain, but I have received a greater one myself,' said Don Fernando, alluding to his being deceived in regard to the sex of the person, he had first met on board of the unmanned ship. 'I think I was told by thee that thou wert the only MAN aboard-it appears thou wert the only woman,' he added with a hearty laugh.'</p> 
               <p>'Pardon, me sir, replied Geraldina, 'I did not intend to deceive you. 'I found that when I was the captain, mate, cook, and all hands of a large merchantman, I could perform my several duties less awkwardly, especially going aloft, in trousers and jacket than in bishop sleeves and petticoat; and finding garments aboard that fitted me, I donned them.'</p> 
               <p>'Excellent! thou art a wonder! a miracle among thy sex! and if ever I do so unprofitable and foolish a thing as to write a romance, thou shalt be the heroine. And now, Captain Manville,' continued. Azvedo, turning to that gentleman, 'the ship in the offing is the Emerald, which I have no doubt her late commander, Miss Geraldina, will willingly surrender into they hands.'</p> 
               <p>'Yes, uncle,' said the maiden, 'I never want the command of another ship!'</p> 
               <p>Manville was almost dumb with astonishment and delight; nor would be consent to retire, late as was the hour, until Geraldina had told her story, and Don Fernando had related his, touching the ship which her commander supposed would be more be heard of.</p> 
               <p>For several days, at the earnest solicitation of Don Fernando, the Americans continued to be his guests; meanwhile the Emerald was well fitted up for the homeward voyage by the contrabandists, and a crew put aboard of her. The day of parting at length came. It was one of sighs, tears and regrets between Edgar and Anita; for they had mutually pledged their loves, and Edgar vowed to return to claim her for his bride. Jethro was the only one of the Americans who desired to remain behind; indeed, there was an attraction which he could not resist; the beautiful Quadroon, Sybil, had contrived so completely to draw him within her fascinating charms that he surrendered at discretion, and entered the service of love and Don Fernando.</p> 
               <p>The Emerald sailed from the isle-there was a tearful eye which watched the receding ship until it became the merest speck in the horizon, and in the direction was it turned long after it had faded away!</p> 
               <p>'Gone! gone, forever!' said Anita, with a sigh from the heart's deepest recess, as she, supported on the arm of Sybil, turned and walked slowly towards the villa.</p> 
               <milestone n="-" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Two months had elapsed since the events last narrated, when off the port of Havana, was descried a fleet of eight sail, four of which displayed the Spanish ensign, while the other four displayed the black flag of the buccaneers, with the ensign of Spain floating triumphantly above it! They were all bearing up for the entrance to the harbor, under full sail, and in line. The unusual appearance of eight armed schooners, four of which were piratical prizes, created an intense excitement, and every position which commanded a view of the sea was quickly thronged with curious gazers.</p> 
                
               <p>Soon a gun was fired from the Moro Castle, and a shot richochetted across the waters, and fell astern of the foremost schooner, which was none other than the Ione, on whose quarter-deck walked proudly and fearlessly the noted contrabandist, and near him stood Dona Anita, gazing anxiously upon the frowning Moro, with its bastions, parapets, and circular batteries.</p> 
               <p>'Fear not, my daughter!' said Don Fernando, observing the anxious expression upon her beautiful fertures; 'that gun is but a signal for us to heave-to; they dare not fire directly upon us.'</p> 
               <p>The Ione came up into the wind, and the whole fleet did likewise. Presently, an armed schooner put our off the harbor, and hove to within a cable's length of the Ione, and sent a boat alongside with an officer. The gangway steps were let down, and the official gentleman, in full uniform, stepped aboard.</p> 
               <p>'Buenos dias, Senor Count Pedrazza,' said the Smuggler King saluting him with a dignified air; 'we have not met since our conference in the harbor of Bahia Honda. Hast another commission from His Excellency, Gonzala?'</p> 
               <p>'My duty is to ascertain by what right an Outlaw carries the flag of Spain at the mast-head?' queried Pedrazza in turn.</p> 
               <p>'Senoor, I cannot brook insult!' said Don Fernando, his eyes flashing with indignation. 'I fear thee not, although the battlements of the Moro is thy protection! Look at this and begone! and the next time we meet have acare that thou addressest me as a gentleman,' and the Smuggler drew from his belt a written parchment, containing a heavy seal, which he unfolded to the wondering eyes of his official visitor.</p> 
               <p>Pedrazza was surprised and amazed, and asking pardon of Don Fernando, immediately turned upon his heel, entered the boat, and returned to the cruiser.</p> 
               <p>The Iona filled away again on her course, followed by the other seven vessels of his fleet, and they boldly passed the Moro and entered the harbor without interruption, and were soon moored in that portion of the harbor usually occupied by the naval craft of the government.</p> 
               <p>In five minutes after the fleet cast anchor, every sail was snugly furled and every loose rope neatly coiled. Thousands of Habaneros thronged the quays, and a thousand vague rumors startled the city from its propriety. Quickly Gonzala, the Governor General, was prized of the fact, by a knowing official.</p> 
               <p>'By the infernal legions!' swore Gonzala, to his informant; 'we have this bold outlaw at last, and his whole power! If he doth attempt to sail from our harbor, the guns of the Moro shall annihilate him!'</p> 
               <p>'If he hath, in truth, captured the piratical squadron of that ruthless pirate, Jose Valdez, and comes here to surrender him and his force to the authorities, will he not deserve some consideration?' suggested the Duke d'Almonte, who was holding a conference with the governor, as the special embassador of the king.</p> 
               <p>'But, my dear Duke, consider,' replied Gonzala; 'Valdez is not so much of a scourge to the Spanish Isles, as is the Smuggler. He deserves to die on the garotte, and such shall be his fate. Anon, I will give thee an outline of his crimes.'</p> 
               <p>With these words, the conference was ended; the Duke departed, and the governor began giving orders to several of his officials, whom he hastily summoned to his presence.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, the Smuggler King, escorted by a large body of his followers, landed, in charge of Valdez, Curcamo, and the rest of the captured buccaneers. Proceeding thence to the Moro, they were met at the gate by the chief official. With a tone of authority Don Fernando required of him to take charge of the prisoners-incarcerate them in the strongest cells, and to permit no one to communicate with them, not even the Governor-General!'</p> 
               <p>'By whose authority?' demanded the officer.</p> 
               <p>'The authority of the King of Spain!' answered Don Fernando, unfolding the same potent parchment he had exhibited to Pedrazza, and holding before the astonished officer.</p> 
               <p>'Pardon, Senor; thy commands shall be obeyed,' replied the official, bowing obsequiously.</p> 
               <p>Don Fernando surrendered up the prisoners, and returned to the quay. At a signal another boat put off from the Ione, and Dona Anita stepped ashore. Carriages were immediately sent for, but before they arrived, a large body of soldiers marched down and took possession of the quay, and completely hemmed in the Smuggler's force. The officer in command approached our stalwart hero, and produced a warrant, with Gonzala's signature, for his arrest, and that of his confederates.</p> 
               <p>Once more did Don Fernando exhibit his<pb n="100" xml:id="VAC6943-00000049"/> talismanic document. The officer asked his pardon, and doffed his chapeau. The party now took seats in several carriages which arrived, and as they departed from the quay, the order was given to 'Present Arms!' and the drums rolled cheerily, as the order was obeyed.</p> 
               <p>The carriages soon halted in front of the hotel, once before occupied by the Smuggler on a mysterious occasion, which, singularly enough, was already prepared for his reception.</p> 
               <p>Soon after the Smuggler and his suite had again taken possession of the hotel, a magnificent equipage drove up, and the Duked d'Almonte was announced, and ushered into Don Fernando's presence. A brief private interview was held between them, and a formidable parchment, with a huge seal, enclosed in a gold case, was given to Azvedo by the Duke. The latter then took his leave, in great haste, and ordered his coachman to drive with all possible speed to the head quarters of the commanding general of the troops.</p> 
               <p>Two hours elapsed, when the sounds of martial music were heard, and a long military pageant, preceded by a troop of horse, approached and paraded in front of the hotel Don Fernando, attired in the uniform, and wearing the ensignia of the highest official of Cuba, surrounded by his suite, magnificently dressed, appeared in the portico, when he was saluted by a salvo of artillery, the roll of drums, and the glad shouts of the multitude. He was then escorted, with the beautiful Anita leaning upon his arm, to an elegant barouche, drawn by four milk-white steeds, which, after they were seated, moved on after the cavalry; then came other carriages, containing his suite, and other distinguished personages; then came the regiments of musqueteers, and the rear was composed of citizens on foot, and a long cavalcade of horsemen. After proceeding through the principal streets, amidst the joyful shouts of the multitude, they halted before the Grand Palace, and it was taken possession of by His Excellency Don Fernando de Azvedo, who that morning received his commission of General, at the hands of the king's embassador, the Duked d'Almonte.</p> 
               <p>This was the long-proscribed Azvedo's day of triumph!</p> 
               <p>This was the day which hurled from power the tyrannical oppressor, the mercenary criminal, Gonzala; for, at the same hour that Don Fernando was triumphantly escorted to the seat of honor and power, Gonzala, in chains, was driven to a dungeon, there to await a multitude of charges, one of which was, that for a series of years he had been in league with Jose Valdez, the notorious Pirate Chief!</p> 
               <p>The day of the trial of the pirates came, and the late governor was tried with them. The proofs were overwhelming, and they were sentenced to suffer death by the garotte, which sentence was soon afterwards carried out. All perished on the same day! thus affording the Cubans one of those grand spectacles, which Gonzala had once declared the populace most delighted in, next to a Bull Fight!</p> 
               <p>Voluntarily did His Excellency Don Fernando make over to the king's embassador, an amount of silver and gold, equivalent to all he had gained in the contraband business. H e also placed in the treasury of the island a vast amount of wealth that he had discovered in possession of the buccaneers.</p> 
               <milestone n="-" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Nearly a year had elapsed, when a magnificent fete was given at the palace of Don Fernando de Azvedo, in honor of the marriage of his daughter, Done Anita, to a distinguished young American, Charles Edgar Manville. The occasion was honored by the presence of his father, Captain Manville, his sister Minna, who had since married a valiant officer in Uncle Samuel's Navy; his brave cousin Geraldina, who was now the bride of a wealthy merchant of Boston; and a large and brilliant assemblage of the most worthy and distinguished personages of Havana, and, indeed of the whole isle.</p> 
               <p>Don Fernando ruled many years, and was honored and loved by his people. His son-in-law and daughter managed to live in perpetual summer, by residing in winter at Havana, and in summer in Boston. In truth, their lives, since they were wedded, may be likened to a perpetual summer.</p> 
               <p>Jethro Strong, and Sybil, the beautiful quadroon, were made one in flesh, and ever afterwards resided on a fruitful plantation, deeded to him and his heirs forever.</p> 
               <p>The name of the Smuggler's Isle has become obsolete; but it is now one of the most flourishing of the smaller of the Antilles, and in a commercial point of view one of considerable importance.</p>
