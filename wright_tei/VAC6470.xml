B. The world,-as all who live in it very well know, has periodical seasons for going mad- constantly-recurring intervals, when straight waistcoats and ornaments of iron seem the only things necessary for its safety, though they have never yet been applied.  One of these spasmodic fits of excitement was at its culminating point at the time of which I write. London had been comparatively  ne for many months, and the long pent-up; enthusiasm of its denizens burst out suddenly, like champagne from a freshly-opened botitle, when a fitting cause for enthusiastic extrava- ganceis arrived, It was not the Comlet-it was not the Moon hoax-it was not the approach- ing Millennium-that roused them so; Neither did it come in the shape of a 'eigiout' revival, or a monster political demonstraion. Little enough had the cause to do with millenniums of revivals, if all was true that was 'whispered' here and there; little enough. with moon bt,  burning stars, or indeed with anything sky- ward. 'Does any one wish me to speak more  plainly?

The history of her life and her avoidance of the metropolis. was, unhappily, no secret; and there was scarcely a shop-boy kin the pit who did not know that her first lover' had ieen a young English nobleman, who died lAst as he was on the point of converting their liaison into a respectable bona fide. marriage; and that, through grief at the loss either of the  lover or the title-(I mention both, because some people said one, while some stuck to the other)-she had well-nigh vowed a vow never to recall the agony of their parting'by visiting the land of his birth-of the 'city where, the brother who 'now bore his name would, very probably come under her notice-possibly be j eruaded to see her- play [. Since his death be had dazzled. Pris, and taken New York by storm-had driven the staid Bostonians wild, and flished through the whole United States ,i*e a meteor, drawing a train of inflammable Yaukees after her, like captives at her chariot wheels. -' Tiring at last, even of their devotion, she had retired from the stage-some said for a time, some said for ever--and had been liv- ing quietly, in aTexan - villa, till she emerged from her seclusion in- thms startling way. It was rumored that the., manager of, the -- Theatre, who had- been, trveling n .the States, had stumbled upon her retreat in the most un- expected and delightful. ay;. i and, animated by his good fortune, so wrought, upon her by Ids, persuasive arguments of tongue and purse, that she resigned her vlla,and accompanied him .to England, with. the avowed intention of playing now and then, through the season. It,' 'might have -been so; but every act of her life' was o thickly overlaid with :romanoe that the truth. was sometimes harder to come at than if it h!dbeen hidden in the deepest. well that was eve dug.,  cnda'!g tongue had taken-its usual license inftie matter of the lovers; the real fact of the se being that Regina had favored only one--   the young Englishman already alluded to. He had seen her at her first appearance'on any stage-he had heard her sing in a minor Pari- sian theatre, and had formed the determination, :hidch-Ie afterwAird arried out, of wiinning her 'for himself, before another had brea the4 a sun- gle word of love in her ear. Her antecedents were of the most simple kind. She was the posthumous daughter of a needy actor, and the company, poor as it was, had generously adopt- ed her. She was the "( child," not of "the regiment," but of t" the stage." There was :. one to question Lord Erlingford's proceedings- -her parents having both gone to their last account; and he took the fair Madelaine to his house and home when she was but-sixteen and he but twenty-one. No one told her that she was doing wrong by going with him; she had never been inside a church since her mother died; -and the poor souls at the theatre, who had been so kind to her, rejoiced openly at her good fortune, and dried the few tears she shed on parting with them, by talking to her of, the wonderful things Lord Erlingford would, give her, and how they should look up atnight to' see her in the stall-box of their house, grand and beautiful as a fairy queen. She wtnt awa smiling in her carriage, with her lover by he side, thinking that Fairy Land could never be one-half so beautiful as Paris, and that. fairy- princes- were not to be named in the same day " 'with the eager boy whose dear blue eyes wel :. looking so tenderly into her own, and whoas:- musical voice was saying :"Mine, Madelaine':'. -mine for ever I   We shkll never .have. to part from  each other again-we shall never have to say ' Good-night' and ' Good morning' "now, e xcept in our own dear home i" "More sinned, against. than sinning,", was poor Madelaine. For Lord Erlinford there was no such excuse. Born in an English home, -and- of English parents, he was well able. to choose good from evil.  It was by his own .de-. liberate. free .will that he entered, even. inrhis earliest years, upon a course of dissi ation that broke his mother's heart, and at last brought I his father, after her to .th grave ; it wras by ;ie own choice thbt,on the very day of his majqr, ity, he left .Oxford for Parts, . determined to. drink to the dregs that aep whosen first draught had intoxicated him so. The year had passed   in the maddest revelryL-his health was ruined, his constitution shattered, and, for the first time in his existence, he felt the stings of re. morse. The pale face of his mother-the stern eye of his father-were ever before him; his boon companions could no longer please, and his usual piursuits bored him. In a word, Lord Erlilufrd was wretched. -In this state of mind he first saw Madelaine. Her innocent beauty charmed and roused him; her timid love, and her naive manner of showing it, completed the spell; and, by way of expressing his interest, he led her on to her ruin I There was only one redeeming point about the arrangement- he vowed solemnly to be faithful to her, and observed his vow. His life was devoted to her service ; for her sake he avoided all his former associates-gave up gaming and drinking-su- perintended her education--studied all her wants and wishes, and made their home as do- mestic and pleasant a place as if it had been located in England, and hallowed by the bles- sing of the Church.      , A  year passed on, and he was soon to be a father. The dormant good (and there was much) in his nature was aroused bv  the tid- ngs. His child! -How would it repay him for the evil he bad, done?How could he bear to look upon its. face, .remembering that his own. T parents, through his fault, were lying cold and sth! the family vault at Erlinford? Only one thing could he do to show. his sorrow for the past-he would make amends to Madelaine --she should be hid wife-she and her child should both be able to bear his name.   , But true is the old proverb,  l, Man propo, ses-God, disposes;"  Lord Erlinford placed a i plain gold ring on Madelaine's hand one even- ing, and led her to an apartment distant from i his own, whispering, as he kissed her, , good  i night'; that  their separation was but for a short i time, that on the morrow she would be his   wife."' The morning came, but -he was far away t from her.  They found ,him lying dead upon  his pillow, with his hands elasped as if in pray- 8 er; aid before the day closed, the spirit of his prematurely-born child had followed him, and  Madelain was lying on her bed, delirious, and t] watched over most tesderly :by herfoster-mo- S a ther oft the theatre. . .

He was tall and fine- - ly formied, btl somewhat awkward in his move- mentiS. Hfis ands and feet, moreover, were rather large than small, and his aress was more dandified than elegant. Had he been a bank- er's clerk, no one would have Hesitated in ap- plying the word "' vulgar" to him. .As he was the Earl of Charlemount, unmarried, and with a clear rent-rqll of fifty thousand a year, peo- ple boggled at that phrase, and compromised the matter with their consciences by saying that he was " odd," "( singular," and " had a taste of his' own." They were quite right. And a very peculiar taste, too, it was, some- times. He wags the second son of Lord Erlinford; and, if truth must be told, had not helped, by his own behavior, to lengthen that peer's life, While his brother Alfred ran over the road to rain with titled associates, George caroused with low and vulgar ones. After the death of his father, he took an odd fancy to the study of medicine; and as it would by no means have been proper for an Erlinford to adopt such a profession, he walked the hospitals in. cognito, and consorted much with students of the Bob Sawyer class, who aided and abetted him in orgies which it is best to leave untold. Before hle had got quite beyond the outskirts of Belgravian and Westendian pardon, his brotherluckily died, and his title and fortune brought him to his senses and to, his proper place in society. He married the daughter of a fcotch peer, and sent her, in less than two. years, to keep his parents company in the fam- ily vault. The physicians averred that Lady Erlinford died of consumption. Old gossips and their clique shrugged their bony should- ers, and muttered: s "A broken heart, more likely." Nevertheless) her little mishap did not keep others from coveting her place; and when the earldom of Charlemount was added to the ba- rony of Erlinford, the poor man was nearly torn in pieces by the many fair hands stretched forth to seize him; and drawled out, one day, to his bosom friend and toady:   . "'oPon my honor, Grosvenor, I must really go abroad, or they will marrv me in sDite of myself." And he did go abroad. He resided in Italy   for a time. tl :a fair marehesa :took it inP hberi head to fall in .loye iib him-for he had a certain beauty of his own.-snd ;to do him the honor of occupying the second eseat in .his traveling-caryrage when he left Veniee; only for avi w miles, however, for the father and brothers were in hot Ipursuit. They came up with the fugitives, and left the earl stretched upon the ground witib a couple of balls in his right lung, while the marehesa was bundled back ignominiously and shut up in a convent, to remember her Englishman or do pehance for her sins, as she dhose. Even the pistol- balls failed to cure him.. As soon as he re- covered, he seto off for America, to amuse him- self with Yankee belles, who were presumptu- ous enough to fancy that a coronet and its owner were within their reach, Fine fun it must have been, for he did not return from the States for several years; and the English maidens had well-nigh ceased to wear the willow, when he reappeared among them, gayer, richer, and more wary than ever. Many'eyes turnedmwist- fully toward the box where he lounged .on this night-many feminine anathemas were launeh. ed at the unconscious head of Captain Tom Grosvenor, "whose odious influence probably kept him from marrying ," but, above all, the ladies were discussing the question of Regiaa's  early love, and wonderingif she would recog- nize' the earl,'and if she would faint or scream when she did so. He had his musings upon the subject himself, and was almost nervously anxious to see the woman who had so nearly robbed him of all he valued most on earth.  Directly opposite the earl's box, was that of his second cousin, Eustace Erlinford, M. P., tenanted by Mrs. Erlinford; a pretty woman of forty-five, and her daughter Helen, a beau- tiful girl, "just out,"' an only child, and an immense heiress, since the bulk of the Erlin- ford estate, in addition to her mother's :for- tune, was settled upon her. She was a blonde  beauty, with large blue eyes, and hair of that perfect golden tin, so seldom seen exeept on the heads of very young children. /A Slight natural wave in its glossy surface added to the charm of this bright cordnal, and a stray ring. let escaped from its durane ' and fell upon the whitest neck in the world. - She ore no odrnas ! ments; pot even a ring or bracelet-marred' the   perfect symmetryof her hand and arm. One modest white rose, with its green leaves, decked her corsage; a bouquet of the same tintlees flowers was onher lap. For the rest, her dress was devised with the purest simplicity, and a scarf of -exquisite filmy lace 7thrown over all, in lieu of an opera cloak, added to it a pecu- liar and pleasing effect. Lord Charlemount, looking across at her through his opera-glass, compared' her-to the young May moon envel- oped in a silvery cloud. It was not often that his lordship grew poetical, but Helen was quite feir enough to excuse the outhurst. "Beauty and innocence, white roses and pu- rity, and all that sort of thing," he said,.shut tingup his glass and turning to Grosvenor. "Come with me, Tom. I must go and pay my respeets to my cousin, and congratulate Miss Er-linford, for she has just been presented at court. We can see Regina quite' as well from their box-only mind, Tom, if Eustace omes in you must listen to him; I can't. He aetually wants me to go and live at Erlinford, and watch over the welfare of my tenants, and see tthat their cottages are healthy, and all that  sort of thing. He has brought some measure into Parliament about them. Do let him talk to you about it, or he'll burst." OQh, I don't mind listening; I can doze With my eyes wide open," said Captain Tom, ( ghod-naturedly, as he followed his patron round to the other box, where they were re- t ceived -by Mrs. Eriinford with a joyous el-  come, and by Helen with a shylook of plea-  sure, such as a fawn might give at the ap- I proaeh of one who has been kind to her. -Helen w always glad to see Charlemount ; she had. t known him froma her cradle, and loved him as f a brother.  One: more remains to be noticed of our th dramtis persona  . In the pit, half sitting, half. i leaaning upon the firstrow of benches, was a fair-hairegt, resolute looking man, apparently d )f the same age as the earl, and bearing"- b tiange to say-a slight resemblance to him, B and also to Helen. It Was difficult to ayn what the likeness consisted, but it was. there. Yet he fr was fr -handsorer than the -earl. Thefore, v head, from which the wavy hair was:- br ihed m carelessly, was high, and. hite, and smooth * f the nose was :lightly yaquiline; the lips full m   te acd firBml; set; the ohiA bautifull g ulded d aud 'sligihtly indented, as if the lips ofVeaub a had lingered ,there one moment; th*- yees B were large, blue; and ,sparkling. VaryigW ith a every mood of their ownesr, though their ge-' 1, eral expression was tinged with melandholy. - The figure of this man was tall an d legani  - his hands and feet of aristocratio smallness; mhis ,r dress neat and simnple; and his whole airl and r mainer refined and gentlemanly in the ex-  i treme. It was difficult to look at him and at a the earl without feeling that they should have changed places. Poor, nameless authorithough he was, he looked far nobler than the peer. Captain Grosvenor, whose eyes had ,been   wa ring over the house, suddenly caught sigh[ of him, and pointed him  out to Lord Charlemount's'notice. ' "There's Clifford!" "Clifford I  Clifford who?" *W6 hy, the Olifford -the author-the man who wrote the book you were mad over the other day. You said you wanted to see him.,. "' To be sure I did.

It was, perhaps, a singular play to present to suoh an audience -that. of 9 Mary Stuart;" but it hoa been written for: Regina, in France, and "toned down " by the present manager, till nothing unpalatable remained for English ears .to listen to. 8o there she stood, that loveliest and most unhappy of queens-never, perhaps, more fitly represented than now. The play opened with her escape from Lochleven Castle. The gray towers of her first refuge rose in the back ground; armed men guarded the drawhridge and the pass; grand noblemen surrounded their liege lady, and Willie Douglas knelt at -her feet, with his bright face raised to hers. The queen, wearing a riding-habit of black, and a velvet cap, whote long white plume almost touched her shoulder, had but just alighted from her horse. One hand played lightly with his flowing mane, the other was extended for the happy Douglas to kiss; while her exulting glance, stretching over wood and' tower, and up to the distant hills, said, plainer than words could do: 4' At last, at last, I am free 1' There was a deae silence when this tableau first met the eyes of the spectators. No one had hoped to see Regina before the second act. The momentary surprise over, that vast audi- ence rose to their feet with a thunder of ap- plause that made the Arabian steed toss his elegant head, and open wide his dark, bright eyes. "Mary Stuart 1"." Queen Mary 1" ', Re- insat Regina'!" echoed through the house. rhe actress stepped forward to the foot-lights, and bent very slightly in acknowledgment of their deafening cheers. Well had her character been chosen; for Mary herself could scarcely have seemed more stately or more fair. Far above the usual )height of women, and as delicately molded as (Psyehe herself, there was yet a lithe grace ahopt her figure that gave the impression of great physical strength and endurance. She was-'active and agile as the panther of -the mountains, and even in her most motionless attitudes there was nothing of repose. A death- less fire shining through a fragile-va i a sharp sword sheathed in a delicately-wrought scab-,   bard-these were the images that suggested themselves to the poet Olifford, as he looked upon that face and form.  Regina wore no rouge. This Was-one of the many theatrical laws- against which she trane- greased boldly ; but no one could regret it who looked upon her. Her complexion was neither fair nor dark; it had the peculiar creamy bue of the American Creole' the tint of that queen of lilies, the Calla Ethiopa. Only with this complexion could match the faint, clear crim- son of, the lips, the' purple-black lustre'of the hair, and the soft, dark-grey eyes, made almost black at times by their large pupils and long, ebon lashes. No roie-tint was On her cheek, and yet it was not pale.. It was easy to see that perfect health and strength joined hands with perfect development in that majestic form. You could see her living, freely and exultantly, as she stood before you. But if there was much of beauty in the face, there was also .much6f pride. Her large eyes scanned the audience with a kind of quiet scorn, as the y shouted and waved their handker- chiefs, and rooked to and fro, in their excite- ment, like the waves of a troubled sea. Clif- ford watched her closely, and faneied he un- derstood her feslings. She seemed saying to herself and to them.: "Here I am--look well at me!  I am the Woman who -lost the world for love, and now I put that world beneath my, feet!  You are all my slavei, if I -will it. I have only to be gracious, and you will kneel to me. You will never let wife or daughter to yours touch my hand, or say a kind word to me;   but you:yourselves will loveme--will worship me-and be spurned for your pains ' Hie was not entirely wrong in his translation.

There was one   last round of applause; and then the buseiness of the play wtrnt on.'

' For my part, I have an idea that Regina is like her." "Do you call her beautiful, my lord 9" ask- ed Mrs. Erlinford. "I shall adopt the plan of my trans-Atlantic friends, and answer you with another ques- tion," he said, laughing. , Do not you?" ' '"Well, no.." "You surprise me."        " "I have heard so much -of her wonderful loveliness, that I confess I am disappointed. She has no color."  "Except in her lips.  But tell me-are these for Regina?" he asked, indicating the roses which lay in Helen's lap.  , " "I hardly know," she said, in a low tone. "I bought them for that purpose."      : "And your courage h is failed?" "Do you find her so formidable, then?" . ".

"Certainly, my lord." "Yes; come back, Charlemount, by all means," said Mr. Erlinford, suddenly joining in the conversation. "This Regina seems to be rather a-pretty little thing,.and she ought to be eneouraged, since it is her first appearance." Lord Charlemount made his adieus and van- ished, with his shadow at his side., Both had the grace not to smile at the M. P.'s speech till they were safe in the .lobby. Then the earl burst out: "Good Heavens I that man's brains and beart are like a fungus! Fancy speaking of that magnificent creature in such a way!" "Smitten!" queried Captain Tom, with a sly nod of the head. "The most beautiful faee--the noblest head -the grandestair I '? raved the earl.

"Only this, my lord-that when I was chat- ting with the manager to-night, ,a hinted-he did not sayit in so many words, of course- but he hinted delicately that he would kick the first man out of his theatre who dared' insult her in any way."  Lord Charlemount gave a long, low whistle. "Aha! so the wind sits in that quarter!" "I suppose so." "always thought there was more in that Texan story than  met the ear:  People don't change their minds in such a hurry for nothing, as a general thing. Well, Tom, what is to be done?" I'm sure I don't know." "s The manager is awkward, and ugly, and disagreeable." "So you think." And so must she by this time. Pshaw As if a woman like that would fling herselt away after such a fashion. Where dees she live?" "He refused to give me her address." "The man is a fool. Does he suppose he can keep her hid in a place like London You must follow the carriage to-night, Tom." "Very well." "My cab is here-talke thAt. I wonder if there would be any use in sending her a note?' ' Oh I that reminds me. The manager said, distinctly, that all letters left here for her would be thrown into the fire, by her request." "Without her seeing them." "Yes." ; The deuce! What can it allimean, Tom? "Let me give you one piece of advice, my lord.', "Out with it " "Make no advances in your own proper-peL son.'   ,   ' "She does not know the title." "D- you think he wl filil to tell her?

Let me have the pleasure of making two of my friends known to each .other. Lord Charlemount has long been anxious to meet you." The young man bowed rathbr stiffly, for be recognized one of the party of starers who had annoyed him so. "There is but one topic for us to discuss this evening," aid the earl, with a gracious smile. "What do you think of Regina?" "One can hardly think, I fancy, when he looks at her," was the reply. "I agree with you. ,But we have not seen her act yet. In the scaffold scene, they say, he is superb."  "No doubt, my lord." "ArvYpu going back directlyP' "Yes."' "I was going to ask you to dine .with me some .day. $hall we say to-morrow?"

They entered the thea- tre again, shook hands in the hall, End Captain Tom stole softly in 'at the pit-doort while the earl went back to his cousin's box.. There was a very audible " hush!" from' the body of the house, at the slight noise of his entrance, and Helen turned round impatiently, but smiled when she saw wio it 'was.; He quickly iesuimedl his seat behimnd Mrs. Erlin- ford, and looked down upon the stage He started at seeing it hung in blaek.' His conversation with the captain had- almost driven Mary Stuart's executioin from his mind, and it eame baok so suddenly that it seemed so far more-real thian it 'would otherwise ;hiive done. There was the 1ilatform covered' With-' serge, a ahair, and a foot-sto of, crimson vilj vet-there, too, was the block, and the execu- tioner, with a sharp; bright axe. ' A strain of-measured i-elanholy musie float- ed in, as the gre: hall-door' oened, 'and 'the   procession entered. Regina, deadly pale, and clad in the traditional dress "A of black velvet, spangled all over with gold,"' and the long white veil thrown back from her '-coif, walked steadily behind the barl marshal, her' rucifix anid breviary in her hand. Accepting the hand of her jailer, she mounted the step ao the seaf- fold, and seated herself in the chair. Her pallor-.the mingled majeety and sweet- hess' of her expression, and t!e sad faces of those around her-made it seem less like act- ing than reality. The audience seemed to for- get. that they were in a theatre-they wept for the ', Queen of all Scotland"--not for Regina. Helen's tears fell fast as she pointed out to Charlemount a little snow-white- dog crouching land quivering at his mistress' feet-the repre- sentative of the little "Skye terrier," who was found moaning near the severed head of Mary, and who never toiuched food after. her death. The executioners advanced, and kneeling at the queen's feet, received pardon for the deed they were to do. Regina rose and laid aside her outer garment, raised her crucifix toward' heaven, and then blessed with it her two weep- ing attendants, as they said " farewell!"Blind- - folded and alone, she turned toward the btock. The stage and-house were gradually darkened -a solemn silence reigned on every side. . " in thee, O Lord, I put my trust l" said the gentle voice.  The curtain descended slowly-Regina bowed her head-the' executioner raised the glittering axe. "Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit!" The eurtain fell, and three heavy blows resounded, one after the other, upon the -block, followed by the plain   tive wail of the dog. The life ul Mary tuart' was at an end;. Up flashed the lights, but the house was si- lent-no one ventured to applaud. It had b/oen almost too real! 'Strong men were dashing tears from their eyes, ;and women wept as it their hearts were broken. Lord Charlemount turned to: Helen, with a suspicious quivering of his lips, as he asked: "Did I not tell you she would touch every heart?" She did not answer; and, looking in her face, he saw that it was quite iolorlee V Mrs E  inri ford saw it, too, and sprang up and caught her, just as she was falling.    "Water,! water my- lord : . She has faint- ed't" Mrs; Erlinford flung the door oped, and be- gan to fan her. Charlemount ran down to a reft'eshment-room, and - possessed himseft of' a decanter and glass., When he returned, Helen was sitting backslin the friendly shadow of -the aurtains, for many eyes were turned that way, She, smiled like an angel as he, presented. the glass, .  "I am afraid I frightened you.'  .  "You did, most certainly.. Was it the heat?"       , "I think not." She drank the water, and re-- -tulned, the glass, '"A thousand, thanks, ma lord!;- I am very sorry I was So foolish.". -" -  Was it her acting that made you faint?"' * Yes. You will, think me very childish, but it was all so like actual life, that -I :was- terri.- fied; and when I heard the axe. I turned sick; I could not do away wi h the idea that they had beheaded her."' "I confess I felt it too, for a moment. The ery of the dog   Was very effectual.- They' ay the little thing quite understands his part." "Will they 'call her before the curtain ", t "Certainly.   They are getting over the t shock already.   Therel Do you not hear h them?" Even as he spoke, a tumult of applause broke out, and the name of Repina filled the  house.  "Can you stay?" asked Charlemount, anx. iously. - It will be rer noisy, nd they say n she does not like to bewailed out after playing fo this part. If you still feel ill, I had better call a carriage.  She may not qonle." "Oh, not I   musatay  -I must see her. in Thank, you.

B      All the environs  of London have their  l0own peouliar charm-it, is pleasant to 'know, r them, to visit them, or even to dwell in them; P but I, confess that neither the stately ruaility of Kensington, the quiet repose of Fulham and Hammersmith, nor the respectability of: el Olapbam, please me like the quaint, foimalas- peot of heleesea, and thegreen lanes and -ram bling houses of Old .Brompton-that, fit abid- ing-place of story and romance. To g from these lovely spots into the city is like leaving Paradise for Hades: one comes baek bewilder' ered, almost gasping for breath, quite willing to venture that way no more, and to forget the grimy monster toiling in his harness, and pol- luting the fresh air with ,his smeky breath at eo short a distsnee. London itself is like a bad dream, from whieh people awake in Londonu's suburbs with a deep sensation of relief, and a f wish so earnest as to bear some relation to a prayer-that they may-never sleep suoh sleep i again.               - Regina was afraid of London. -That word  m alone will express her feelings -about the city proper. She had, driven through it rith the fi manager - the very, day fter her arrival, and d had 'been shocked at its grimness, and-its gen- eral air of utter absorption in one puisuit.

She looked up .with a roguish emile, and put out her little hand. .     r ' Ah now,.yqu are longing to shake aeto pull myears 1 :I eansee it m youjeyesl, 1But* don't get angry-shake hands, and say you forgive me l'l He did so, laughing inapite of himself; for she looked. preeisely like a hild -who has, been naughty, and- half expects a beating-being, wholly sure that it deserves one. - . .

You should see it in November- Do    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6470-00000009"/> you object to it? London would not be Lon- don without fog." Regina looked half ready to cry. "Then I am quite sure I cannot stay. Ev- try one looks unhappy.--every one seems to be working for money-thinking for money-- iving for money. I do not like these houses you are showing me now. They are too tall, too grand. I want a little cottage home, with a garden, where I can dig in the ground, and plant violets. I want small rooms--I want- a kennel for Fidele, and a stable for my horse. I want to see the sky and the sunshine, and hear the birds sing, and walk in the green fields, and breathe better air than this. And so you must let me go back to my beautiful France, or my home in America, dear monsieur; or I shall die i" He sat gazing at her, open-mouthed,' as, with the simplicity of a child, she poured out these humble httle plans. "And you would really like that life?' "I have always liked it." "Why, I thought you would complain be- cause the houses were not magnificent enough; and so I have- been showing you the handseom- est ones I could find, But if you only want a cottage and a garden-" - "That is all, I assure you. Will you let me go back to France?     * "Pshaw I it still, and be a good girl!" he exqlaimed, in a half-fatherly, half-brotherly klindness, that pleased her beyond expression. -France, indeed I Why, England is the very birth-place of cottages I I doubt if they know how to build them in any other country, much less live is them. And so you have no grand tastes after all. You only wish to pet your horse and your dog, and to plant violets, poor child!"And. his smile was very pleasant, as he ptulled the check-string, and ordered the coachman to drive out to Old Brompton., He had believed the rumors about Regina-, he had accepted them as a part of her position and reputation; but from that moment he felt that they were false, and made himself a prom- ise, that while she remained near him; he aould watch over her as faithfully and as ten- derly as if she had been his sister or his child. He did not break that vow.  And so Regina pitched her tent in an odd   little cottage, behind high walla, ith plenty of garden-ground and an attempt at a lawL, which she decreed should be changed into a p ddook, where the white horse might feed sometimes in summer. It was a pleasant little place:-more like a bird-cage, it may be, than a houie; but that did not matter as long as a bir.] was dwell- ing there. There was a miniature drawing- Foom, with French windows opening on the lawn; a dining-room opposite, under whose easements blossomed in swarms a perfect bank of roses of all colors and kinds; there was a library at the back of this apartment, and a tiny conservatory behind the drawing-room, the sight of which made Regina dance with delight. In less than a fortnight the new house was ready; and Captain Tom Grosvenor following her carriage on that wild March even- ing from the theatre, wished heartily that she had chosen a dwelling-plaae where ;the winds of heaven would visit his "i fair' ftce", a, little less roughly. Few, however, would have found fault with the winds -or storms after having been admitted within the gates. A pretty trel- lised walk led up to the principal entrance. On the right was the paddock, soon to be sown over with grass and clover-seed, for the ben- efit of the Arabian! On the left, the flow er-garden, embellished with a fountain, a dial, and a rustic summer-house. A beautiful weep- ing willow trailed its pendant branches over the fountain's edge. In summer, when- the boughs were green, the water flashed. up through them like a spray of diamond drops. A seat formed of the twisted trunks of young trees stood: nder the willow., The quaint aspect of the interior fully agreed with that of the exterior. The hall was de- corated with a deer's head and horns "iithe velvet;" with a eurious collection of riding- whips, a set of slender, mouse-colored oars, marked with the letter "R;" a beautifully- wrought bow and quiver full of arrows--evi- dently the worlk of Parisian, hands; a silver- mounted rifle, and a hunter's horn,. with an. agate mouthpiece and tassels of green silk. At the upper end, stood two huge suits of armor, nick-named by their owner ', Gbog aid Magog," after the far-famed London giants. Drawing .and dining-rooms must always be more or less alike;, and Regina's, though crom-   fortably and tastefully furnished, need not--be mentioned here. The library was her own pec culiar haunt, and bore more trace of her inner self than any other apartment in the house. On, the' morning of whichI write, a bright fire blazed upon the hearth, for the air was cold and the wind high among the garden trees. Before the fire was drawn a round table, covered with appliances for breakfast, and-a crimson velvet easy-ehair, of tempting shape, with the morning-paper unfolded on its arm. -. footstool matching the chair was filled -by a white, flossy, curly dog, who eyed the door anxiously, and now and then, started up with a glad whine at the sound of distant footsteps. This was " bonny Prince Charlie," the faithful companion of Marv of Scotland. Opposite him a sleek, grey cat, dozing on an embroidered cushion, who was evidently thinking more of the warm fire and the warm breakfast to come than of his absent mistress. Walking, with turned in toes, up and down the back of the easy-chair, a bird of preternatural blackness, whose pale blue eyes watched slyly the other inlmates of the room, seemed meditating an as- sault upon one or both of them,   This was ' Peter," an American  , crow," first cousin, by i birth and lineage, to that " feathered mystery, I called in England a raven.  Peter was a char. X acter in his way, and led the gray cat an un- i easy life when he dared venture near enough  to tease her. At present he was croaking-aiud.  muttering to himself in an undertone, evidently I displeased at the loud rejoicing of the canaries e flying from flower to tree, in'the warm conser- vatory, whose glass doors had been made to r open into this room as well as the other.  8 The walls of the library were lined' with  X books. A   light ladder leaning in one corner t showed that. even those upon the topmost a shelves were read. Above the chimney-piece hmng a  painting- ti the work of one of the old masters-and-for fi that reason, as well as its beauty, invaluable. S A   single face-a woman's face, full 'of grief, but em no less full of faith and love, -The golden hair -t fell neglected upon- the white shoulders; the a eyes w  ere raised to heaven, tearful, yet mild At and calm, and blue as the sky on, which they, 8 looked; the lovely lips eeerd about to part in a   pensive emile% and te hands, ali! they gi   be 'were clasped upon tjIe beautiful boom ,in e- humble prayer at last, t eeded not the ala er baster vase within. them to tell :er colntry or her name. All knew, who gazed upon her that It she was the Magdalen of the Jews, the ", Mag  dalen" who. afterwards became "Mary," aPd an sat at the feet of her Master, and chose the e, " better part."              . a  That picture acquired a sad significance ip e, Regina's room. - Heaven only knows what  thoughts were in the. poor girl's heart,.when, a with. her own hand, she placed that touehing r memorial of the ead past, where her eyes, and a the eyes of all who might visit her, must fll.  upon it from day to day. I There were no other pictures, but near thea e window stood a fine model of the Arabian, I with Prince Charlie, holding his bridle, at his f feet. Next to this, was a complete skeleton, arranged upon a stand in such a way, .that it could be turned about, and studied,at pleasure. Then came a Turkish "waternpipe," with a scarlet fez hanging ,on, its twisted stem, A blade of Damascus steel, Uaked and giterinmg, was suspended from the shelvesabove, asiif to guard the Koran-over which it hung. Lastly, a small cabinet, whose doors wereajar, dis- played a fine collection of shells, and minerals, and a- few'stuffed birds, that .had .one sung and sported in a Texan chapparal. A Swiss lock surmounted this, cabinet. As the .bell of a neighboring 'hurceh tolled the hour of nine4 it began to play a plaintive little air, and before it aeased, Regina entered the room. She was dressed yery simply. in a morning rob. of some finue' black clothe whose hanging sleeves were lined, with ,crimson. A sma, pointed lace collar set off the whiteness of her throat; sleeves of the same. material;, acord and tassels of black and crimson about her waist, and velvet slippers, completed her eos.- tume. H-er abundant hair was thrown baeck.  from her forehead, and confined in a silken net. ,She wore no ornament, no brooh,; brsaelet, or earring-nothinghut: the one plain i;irolet on 'the, third finger of her left hqnd.'. Yet inlome  mysterious wav she managed to look quite ,a  stately aBi-when she wore the dress,of, Mary Stuart and Sootland's royal crown   . , It was a pretty thing to see her morning greeting to the creatures dependent on her lowf    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6470-00000010"/> and care. The Arabian, had already been vis-i' ited and fed, now she caressed the dog and cat, and allowed the bird to perch upon her shoul- der, while she sang and whistled to the delight. ed inmates of the conservatory, and placed some lumps of sugar and bits of apple within their domain. Coming back to the table, she touched a bell, and moved a chair from the wall beside the fire. Instantly a trap fell, and a dumb-waiter rose through the vacant space, Jloaded with plates of cold ham, bread, and 'butter; two egg-cups, covered with napkins; "two saucers of cream; a tiny plate, with a :square of cake upon it; a silver coffee-pot; and a chased basket, filled, even at that inele- ment season, with oranges and grapes. This was her breakfast, and it was a fancy of hers to take it without seeing the face of a single per- son-friend or servant-till it was over. Hence the dumb-waiter. She placed the saucers of cream respectively before Prince Charlie and Richard the Third, filled the extended claw of Peter with the cake, and carried a generots bunch of grapes to the conservatory, for the birds. Then, bidding all her pensioneers be good and- quiet, she took down a favorite volume from the shelves, drew her chair nearer the table, and basking luxuri- antly in the warmth of the fire, began, accord- ing to custom, her mental and physical meal together. An hour passed by unnoticed. At its ex- piration, a gentle knock made itself audible at the door. Regina laid aside her book, and Madame Prudence, the " bonne mbre," entered, her keen, brown face and little active figure contrasting almost ludicrously with the sober 'garb of an intensely "respectable"British 'matron, which she had assumed,.by way of de- fining her position in the eyes of the servants under her control. "Well, ma mkre, the 'top of the mornin' to you!" said Regina, with a ludicrous blend- ing of the French and Irish accents, justly at- tributible to the volume of "Charles O'Mal- ley," over which she had been laughing. "How goes the world with you, to day?" Madame Prudence advanced her withered cheek for the morning salute, and having re- ceived it, sat down, and began to open her budget of news.   "In the first place, my dear, I have actually seen the blue sky to-day, almost as blue as it used to be in France!"  "Oh, that is pleasant I told you it would come, by-and-bye. And. now, I supeose I can begin with my flowers? Where are tLe seeds?"' Prudence heaved a very long sigh., "Dear girl, you will never forgive me. They are lost!" "LosO?"  "These young servants are stupid beyond belief. Imagine, my dear girl, that one of them found the little packets in the drawer below, and threw them into the fire!" "All?" "All!" replied Prudenee,l with tragic' em- phasis.. "And she consoled me; afterward, by saying that she thought they were rubbish!" "Rubbish that it will take time, and pans, and money to replace," said Regina, shrugg' A her shoulders. "We must go to some nurser, f4 gardens,/that is all, Prudence. But take c ;/: that incapable does not get hold of the pat , ages a second time. Now, what have you , your apron-pockets for me? They look suS- piciously-full! Have you been buying some bonbons for the spoiled child?" ,Prudence laughed-gave a postman's-knook upon the back of Regina's chair, and emptied the contents of her pockets upon the table. "Bah!" said the actress. "Only letters! After one has been twenty-one, what possible interest or pleasure can there be in a few sheets of ' humbug.' as they used to call it in the States."  t- Nevertheless, she brokly the seals languidly, while Prudence, clearing the table, sent the dumb-waiter down again, and restored the room to its usual appearance. At last, Regina utter- ed a sharp exclamation, and struck her cleneh- ed hand upon the table. "What is it, my dear?"  , "That he should dare to write to me I He- of all others!" "-Who?"  "Charlemount!" Prudence looked quite bewildered. , Do you know him, my dear?" "Oh, have I never told you, then? He is an earl-an English earl-and he is also-hie -.Alfred's brother i'   "But what does he say?" "Say l'  She . sprang from her seat, and walked, angrily, up and down the room. "What 5o all men say, Prudence? What do all men A-yy-to me?" "He lfas uttered it, then?" "He has!"And she struck the letter pas- sionately with her hand. "He says he loves me I He proposes magnificent settlements -- settlements!"  She laughed bitterly. "I am to go and live with him, Prudence! I am to be his p'aything-his toy! I, who should- . who might have been his brother's wife, and Countess of Charlemount myself! It drives me wild! Was there no thought of delicacy- no feeling of tenderness toward his dead brother -no chivalrous generosity for a woman, young, and worse than alone-to keep him from this? These dry bones, Prudence-these dry bones -'Sve more of pity and honor in them than the 'earts of men!" a She leaned her head upon the stand of the peleton, as she spoke, and  played with its liong fingers, while tears of rage and wounded pride dimmed, for a moment, the brightness of her. eyes. "Have you ever seen this earl?" asked Pru- dence, at last. "Often, at the theatre. I asked the manag- er to point him out to me that very first night. He was in a box with a beautiful young girl." "Alone?"' "Oh, no!   It was evidently a family-party. I judged that he was about to marry her. And yet he dares write this letter to me!" "Is he like my   lord?" asked Prudence, wishing to divert her attention from the note, even if she pained her thereby. "Like him ! .Thank Heaven-no  ! The earl is stout, and large, and handsome ;. but he has not Alfred's face-he has not Alfred's heart, or he would never have done this." Perhaps Prudence-little dry old woman of the world that she was-had her own ideas about her dead master's conduct, and thought, secretly, that there was little to choose between the two; but the rack would never have drag- ged this opinion from her-and'she wisely kept an unbroken silence, till Regina's passion had exhausted itself in words. Then she replied: "My dear, I  really think he has been here."   "Here? The earl?" "Yes."' "What do you mean?" "Yesterday, when you were out riding, a gentleman rang at the garden-door and asked for a glass of water. He said he was fatigued with a long and warm walk." "At this time of the year? Well, go on." "I carried it to him myself. He asked no questions about you; but I saw him look cu- riously around at everything in the hall. He thanked me very politely after he gave me back the glass, and said the water was exceedingly pure and sweet." "I wished it had choked him!" said Regina, ungraciously. "But how did he look?" "A very tall, grand man, with much hair, curling, and a beard. He speaks low. He carries his head like this." And she threw back her own with an air of dignity that made Regina laugh. "The very man, Prudence. I suppose he had the grace to take himself off after this?" "At once." "Was he walking?" "No. The servant told me she saw him en- ter a broughrm at the head of the lane.", "And the brougham had an earl's coronet upon it, I suppose?;  . Prudence nodded her headl "That is nothing, however. The man who would insult one woman thus, would not hesi- tate long over a  lie to another. Well, Pru- dence, if he comes again--" "Yes, dear?"            "And he asks for water, give it to him; but qualify it with a little prussio acid first." The worthy woman looked horrified. "Upon my word; I have it in me to prepare such a draught at this moment. Stay; you shah give him no water-'but this!" And she tore the unlucky letter into fragments, dashed them upon the'floor, and set her foot upon them. "Relate that to him, my/good Pru- dence, the next time he is fatigued; and tell him that, for the love he proffers, Regina re- turns him her bitterest hate and seorn. " There are some women who reach the height of their beauty only when they are enraged-- some who,\ like the spotted leopard, must be roused before their peculiar charm appears.    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6470-00000011"/> It was thus with Regina. Always fascinating, always winning, she must of necessity be; but strong moments were the seasons of her most resistless power. As she stood there by the window, the intense burning vitality contrasting so strangely with the fleshless fignre at her side; her pale cheek flashing with a vivid crimson; her large eyes dilated, dark, and troubled to their lowest depths; her slender figure drawn up with a stately air, and her head raised defiantly-it would have been dif- ficult to find a more glorious picture of youth, of womanhood, of passionate emotion, than she presented. Even Prudence acknowledged the obarm. What, then, must he have felt, who stood upon the threshold of the door for one brief moment, and gazed with the eyes of a poet and a man upon Regina, already the idol of his dreams? She was first to notice him. The angry look in her eyes gave place to one of astonishment, and then returned again. "Sir," she said, haughtily, " who are you?" And how do you happen to be intruding here?" * I come from the manager of the --- The- atre. I am writing the new play, and have waited on you by your own request. I am sorry that the servant's entry and my own were unobserved. Believe me, madam, I had not the slightest thought of 'intruding' on you." Advancing into the full light 'of the room, he spoke these words gravely, and somewhat. haughtily. Then he observed that Prudence was gazing at him with the most intense ter- ror, and that Regina had clasped both her hands above her heart, and uttered a slight ex- clamation. "Your name-your name?" she said, ea- gerly, without moving from her place. "My name is Clifford." Clifford? Ah 1" She drew a long breath, motioned Prudence out of the room, and coming back to the fire, pointed out a seat to him, while she sank into her own, and covered her face with her hands. Somewhat puzzled by this greeting, Clifford yet rejoiced at it, for it gave him time'to look at Re4ina more closely than he had ever done   before. He marked the purity of her corn plexion, the delicacy of her hands and feet, the - gently swelling outline of the bust, half hid- den, half defined, by the loose dressing-ggwn; and felt, in his heart of hearts, that he, had never done justice to her 'beauty; that ahe herself had never done justice to it upon the' stage. At the same time, an odd conscious. ness possessed him that had Regina been the pure ideal of his young life's dream, be should never have dared to gaze upon her thus ; iever ventured to make a mental catalogue of her charms so boldly. He wound up all with the reflection--"Lord Erliiford was a happy man, but I doubt if he knew it thoroughly. I miglht have been far happier than he, had I been in his place. But, now. Ah! there is nbthitg between this woman and myself-there will be nothing, though I feel that there might have been, had she been pure." '     P Unconsciously, his eyes wandered from her downcast face to the uplifted one of the pic- tured Magdalen; when they turned once more towards her, she was also looking at him. A brief shadow crossed her brow; then she began the conversation, as any other lady, intent upon business only, might have done. "I beg you to pardon' my rudeness, Mr. Clifford," she said, courteously.. I had been mdch annoyed-in fact, I was thoroughly out of temper--and I am afraid, in the heat of the moment, soeae of the vials of wrath, intended for an absent person, may have been broken on your head." "I got only a single drop," Clifford hasten- ed to say. '"For that I apologize.' "It didn't hurt." His brief smile provoked her, and she an. swered brusquely: "Of course'not. But we will proceed to business now. Mr. Irwin was speaking to, me yesterday about your play, and I expressed a wish to see you in person.:' Clifford bowed. "I like the play." "Thank you." "And, when I appear in it, I expect to make what you Engfish people call a ' sensation.' It suits me-the character, 1 mean." , It is accepted, then, madam?" "Did not Mr. Irwin tell you?"   He left the pleasant tidings to comes'tlrough a pleas int channel," said Clifford, smiling. "Is that a compliment? Don't pay me compliments; I don't care for them. But are you really at ail pleased?" "Indeed, I am! I am flattered in my mind, as an author; and in myv purse, as a poor man, by the good news you have given me. For, if truth must be told, I fancied that play would be rejected." Why?" ;l Mr. Irwin told me it would be subject to your decision." "Well, I am not a-very unmerciful judge." "I perceive it now. But after seeing you in all your great parts, I almost despaired of producing anything suitable to you '" "Have you the manuscript here?" Clifford produced it from the breast-pocket of his icoat, gayly bound in crimson morocco, with gilded edges. At sight of these decorations Regina smiled. "Mr. Clifford, this is your first play." He looked up from the volume, a little sur- prised. "True! Did Mr. Irwin tell you?" '*No!" "Who, then?" "Yourself!" and she pointed to the'cover of the book. '"A first child, whether of heart or brain, is always gayly clad. Wait for a time. When you have a larger family around you, you will be less careful of the appearance of your fast-coming bairns." "Perhaps. But you are partly the cause of all this bravery." "Howi. "Having a fatherly pride in my offspring, I determined, in case it was looked upon kindly, X to offer such a copy at the goddess's shrine, ] that she could not but accept, and honor me by studying her own pat from its pages. They .j are not worthy "such an exalted destiny--and ' yet-." He   did not finish the sentence, but, a kneeling  playfully al Regina's feet,.laid the o book upon her lap. For one moment she gazed wistfully into the J beautiful face, so like that of the dead. Then N she motioned him to. rise, and opened the vol- ume.  "It is beautifully done. The writing is like  copperplate. Whose work is it?"   "M line, madam?" "Yours! Why, I thought 'authors always wrote worse than anybody else," was her grave a exclamation. Clifford laughed. "I believe they do, generally speaking. But, fortunately for the purity of my penalan- ship, I had a year's practice in a lawyer's office before the mania for scribbling seized upon une. T'rhe printers, I believe, mutter 'curses uot loud but deep 'over such sheets as usually go through the press; but I have notiost my old gift yet, when I choose to exercise it, and I took great pains with that."      - "Meaning it for me?" asked Regfna. "For you." "Has any one else seen it?" "No one." She looked at it and at him with a smile of pleasure. Hers was an intensely jealous na- ture. She was annoyed or gratified by trifles few would notice; and if Clifford had shown the volume even to his most intimate friend, she would have prized it far less than she did. '"I accept it with the greatest pleasure," she said. "It was a very graceful thought of yours, I must say.  I hardly expected suchuch---[ mean, I thought English people were entirely 'different from this. But, perhaps, you are not English yourself?"        .. A, sudden  flush dyed his face, even to the temples. "Madam, if hearts know anything of their 'ineage, mine would say that English blood filled my veins. I cling to England as to my home and my country. At the same time, I do not know--." He paused with a  heavy sigh.  Regina burst out with honest, impetuous lamentations over- her blunder. 'I have pained you, Mr. Clifford. I think no other human being was ever so unlucky as 'I! It only needs that a word should not be said, for me to speak it. What must you think of me?   Do forgive me!"' "I have nothing to forgive. How could you know, dear madam, that the question would pain me P?" "Butit did; and you must say yov forgive me. There is a small pain lying at the ebo- tom of my heart till I  hear those words." "Banish it then I   T forgive you."    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6470-00000012"/> She looked satisfied, and .turned to the play again. "Will you be vexed if I criticise this a little?" "No." "I think you have made .a mistake in 'the character, but only in one place. Zenobia for- ives her recreant husband." "Do you object?" "Decidedly." "But a woman's love, madam! Surely, I am right imnmaking it outlast a woman's hate." She shrugged her shoulders. "Mr Clifford, you may be a student of hu- man nature; you may fancy you understand it thoroughly; but, like all men, you blunder ludicrously, or painfully, as the case may be, when you begin to write of women. This play is proof." "Show me." She turned over the pages till she came to the last scene. "There!"' "Well?" "That woman is a queen-a banished queen; and banished because her husband has seen fit to love one fairer and younger than she. She has the passionate eastern blood in her veins. She has suffered keenly for years; and her rival has ruled and enjoyed in her stead. She has learned to hate that man as deeply as she once loved him; but at the last hour, when she lies dying, poor and alone,.you bring him to her bide; and, with a few weak words of penitence-you do not even make him gener- ous enough to renounce that rival-and yet you picture her clinging to him as fondly as ever, and sighing out her forgiveness with her latest breath 1" "And a very effective thing I thought it," said Clifford, frankly. "No doubt. I can fancy the water in your eyes, and the glow at your heart. I can just appreciate the throb of masculine vanity, and the thrill of that mawkish thing you eall pity ' for Zenobia I Oh! I know perfectly how you wrote At " she answered,- sarcastically. *"But is it not true?" he asked, looking at her steasily. ' "True  My dear sir, do you really fancy women are such idiots?" and she burst out laughing in his face.   Now, no man likes to be laughed at; still, less to have white teeth gleam mockingly ovel the most pathetic efforts of his genius-those very " bits '" which he had fancied would draw tears from every eye. Clifford bit his lip, and sat very uneasily in his chair. "I shall find it difficult to make my peace after this, but I must go on. It is not true, Mr. Clifford. There may be some of the spaniel breed among us, but, trust me, Zenobia was not one. You have painted her, I believe, very correctly, till that last scene. You have made hei the proud, ambitious warrior-woman; lov- ing deeply, but also loving fiercely, and bat- tling frantically with her hard fate till the very last. Do you suppose suck a creature would melt into tenderness at the first word of that crowned traitor? Do you suppose she would forget who wai ed for him in his royal palace .? Do you suppose for one instant that the dead love could awake, and she pardon him?" "You would hardly have done so!" said Clifford, musingly. Up to her cheek flew that red flush again-- back to her eye came the flashing glances, and a strong tremor ran through her from head to foot. She clenched her hand, and smiled. "'I forgive a traitorl I love him once more!" "It shall be altered," was Clifford's hasty answer. "' You know your own woman's heart and nature far, far better than I." He made a memorandum on a card, slipped it between the leaves, and put the book in his pocket again. Then leaning back in his chair, he glanced round the room, and at Regina. "May I stay a few. moments longer? My busine-s is finished; but, to tell the truth, I do not like to go." She laughed. "Stay, then, Mr. Clifford. '"I am not keeping you from anything-you are not goir g out?" .  "4 Not I; this is one of my lazy days-I al- ways hbve one after acting." ,' Does it tire you?" "I it wears me. See!" and she held up her hand. It trembled and quiv ered like a leaf in the autumn wind. "You do not go out enough, I'm afraid," "I take a long, fast gallop every day with   my Arabian. I walk for hours about these quiet lanes.. I ramble all over my little do- main, and I dance often when the fit seizes me'; so that by bed-time I am as tired as a child that has played all day. In one fashion or an- other, Mr. Clifford, I am nearly always moving. At present, however, it suits me to remain per- ctly inert-thus!" She nestled luxuriously into the depths of er easy-chair, and half closed her eyes. The garden outside was gay with sunshine, and the songs of the sparrowsan the subdued house. noises came pleasant to the ear; and the con- versation progressed for some time, until Clif- ford suddenly exclaimed, as if a quick thought had struck him: "Ten minutes--or, atlmost, half-an-hour- ago, we were)utter strangers. And here I am talking to you as if I had known you for years"!" 6"You fei the charm, then, as well as I 1" she exelclied, looking into his animated face. "The charm   I You have giveni'its right name. Yes, I feel it." "Do you know why?" "Rumor told me, long ago, that all who ap- proached Regina must acknowledge it, sooner or later.  I have done so from the first mo- ment, that is all." "Humph!" she said, sharply, raising herself in her chair, and looking at him with a slight E curve of the lip. ,  ,I may as well tell you, 1 t once for all, Mr. Clifford, that I) detest compli- j ments, They have been dinned into my   ears .t by every idiot I have met for seven years past. e I  beg that you will not begin them. As for  m KRumor"--she paused, and glanced at the Mag-  E dalen above their heads--," as for Rumor, that lady and I are not on the best of terms. Do you believe all the gossip tells you-especially n about Regina?"  His glance followed hers. It was impossible d to mistake her meaning.  But he answered  n her as frankly as 8se had asked it.      l ' When. I  entered this room, I might bhave- w done so. I confess it would be very diffieultf  for me to believe anything against you now." "  Because .I havetalked about literature, in In the place of allowing you to. make love to me." if "You wrong me hy saying it.

Whatever interest ; I may have felt in you (and it is difficult not ,. dto feel some after seeing you upon the stage), I was wise enough to keeps to myself. The :* young page who held up the train of Zenobia's royal robe had as much reason to hope 'fox her smiles as I to hope for yours." if  "Are the skies about to fall? I have heard of that paragon of paragons, a modest man-; 3 but never expected to see him here in my h- ; brary. And so you really think you .are not worthy to bear away the prize?"  "I said nothing about worthiness!" he ex- * claimed, so indignantly, that she laughed until the tears came into her eyes. "Ah! I thought the humility was only as- sumed!   Wel, Mr. Clifford, it is not very like- ly that you, or any one else, will ever bear me off. -But, having set your heart at rest on that point, I wish you would tell me why you were not going to try." "t You are the most provoking person I ever met!' "Capital! We  shall get on well if you pay me such compliments as that! But why would . you not try, Mr. Cjifford." And again her arch, beautiful face was turn- ed toward him. "Well, if I  might say it-though I cannot see why you should want'to know it-I am a poor man, and what is more, a nameless man. I  cannot afford to be wicked--and if I could, there would be -no prestige about any sin I should commit, to make a   woman'like you willing to share it with me. Is that spoken plainly enough?" "Quite   1' ",So, though I admired you, probably as much as any other man could have done, on the night of your first  appearane, I never dreamed for a   moment that I should come nearer to the Scottish queen--still less,. that I should see her one  day, discrowned, and talk with her, as Itam doing now." ' Well, -go on." . "When I    first came lere, that thought of  my poverty was uppermost in my mind.

"- Regina thanks you!" He held the hand for one moment in his own, then bent down and' pressed his lips upon it. Something moved him strangely, for a tear fell with the kiss. A softened look quivered in the dusky depths of her own eyes. "* A tear---and for me'?" " I could find it in my heart to wish that we had met years and years ago," he murmured, half-inaudibly. "Years and years ago? But I was very happy then I Come here with me. I will show you what I mean." Still holding his hand, she drew him toward the window, and halting before a detached row of shelves, touched a spring concealed behind the books. The shelf swung slowly out into the room--a dark recess appeared, in which something like an artist's easel stood. She drew it out. It was a picture, mounted like the others; and turning it toward the light, she bent over it a moment, lovingly, and then beckoned him to look. He did so. He saw the face of a young and beautiful man-a bright, eager face, shaded by waves of sunny hair,and smiling alike with lip and eye, as if from a world where death or change could never come. His first feeling was of admiration; his- second, of jealousy ; his third-that made him start, and look tom the portrait to Regina. with a peculiar glance. "I need not ask you who this is." "I think not." "Lord Erlinford." "To you! But ' Alfred'to me--always!" * How much you must have loved him!" Her lip trembled a little. "With my whole heart, Mr. Clifford. And that4 from me, means very much." !"I can believe it." Here was a slight pause, during which they both gazed at the face whose earthly model had long moldered into dust, yet left it behind, bright and beautiful as ever. A"Since he died," said Regina, very calmly, "no -one, not even Prudence, has looked at this picture until nowl Can you tell why I have broken through the strict rule for you- for you, who (as you just now said) could be   called nothing more than an utter stranger half an hour ago?" Clifford looked uneasy. "I have a thought of my own-but it may not be yours. I would rather not put it into words."' "You need,not fear. I am very sure it is the right one." ', Well, then, although we can never see our- selves as ' others see us,' I have a kind of con- seiousneus of my outward self, as I suppose every one has. And I fancy you detect a re- semblance (which I am persuaded must exist in some small degree, or it would never have crossed my mind) between the portrait and my- self." "Quite right. The same mother might have borne you both. You are far mFore like Alfred 'than Charlemount himself. Have you any- oh, I am forgetting!" "No," he said, looking kindly at her, as she checked herself, "I am no relative of theirs. I have no family. I might have dropped out of the skies, for aught I know.. But,the likeness I bear to them is certainly peculiar. I have even been told that I am like Miss Erinfor herself." '"Who is she?" "The daughter of Mr. Eustace Erlinfrd. He is a younger branch of the, house; but if Lord Charlemount dies, he will be earl." "Ts she fair, too, with blue eyes?" "Yes." "And an innocent face?" "Yes." "I have seen her, then. She was at the theatre the first night I came. Charlemount was with her; and she flung me a bouquet of white roses-' sweets to  the sweet,' I sup. pose.", "' I flung you some flowers, too." "Did you?" "Some simple white violets. I had been at infinite pains to procure them, and I think ,7 saw you put your foot on themn as you passed out. That was pleasant." , Very likely," said Regina, taking out her note-case, with a smile. "Were they at all like these 2" She held them up, faded, but fragrant still, before his eyes.   "What?  You  kept them  Are thev mine?" "No; they are mine," she answered, quietly replacing 'them, and returning them baok to her pocket. "But you need not put on that look of gratified vanity!" ' H " ' There, never mind. I know that you are vain; your sex proves it." "When it is universally known that yours has monopolized every grain of that commod- ity," he murmured under his breath. "Thank you," said Regina, whose ears were like those of the greyhound in the fairy tale. "Opinions differ on that subject. However, as I was saying, there is no call for you to be puffed up on this occasion. I caught a glimpse of your face as you threw the flowers, and kept them for the sake of it. It is because I cannot find it in my heart to be cold and state- ly toward any one who looks at me with Al- fred's eyes." "And that was why you started so when, I came to-day. "Yes. As for Prudence, I   am persuaded she thought you a spirit, for the first moment' or two. There, we will put the picture back again.^ He   helped her to lift the stand, and close the recess. Then they went back and stood near the fire. She stooped down to fondle Fi i dele,/aid to stroke the arching neck of the  gray oat.                  1 "Ate you not lonely here?" he asked, look- a ing round the pleasant apartment. "Sometimes. ,   "You feel that these pets of yours-these r booky, yonder singing-birds-cannot, after all, t quite filtlup your life?" "They nearly do; so. And then I have my t garden, my trees, my fountain, my summer o sky., and my midnight moon. Believe me, I o am not a person to be pitied. While the sun shines, and the green trees wave, Regina will never be lonely, or very sad." "It is a  brave heart, I know, but I think it yearns at times," he said, in German. "For what?"     ' "Companionship."            d i   Xv '   'And if it does?"' ".Seek it"  y  "It is all very well to say that!" she ex- eo claimed, half-pettishly. "I have sought it It often: and what did I find? Only something that I did not value-a paltry pretence of love, that would have failed me if I had been idiot- e i enough to trust it; that, at its very best, 'was nothing but vailed selfishness."  3  "There are other things in life'-in the world!" " Indeed!   Where?" "Here!"He laid his hand upon his heart, looking straight into her eyes, the while she s, hook her head. "I ask only to be a friend to you!" he added. "I have no faith in friends!" "' Let me teach you!" he said. "You are very kind.  But no, we will have no pretence of friendship, .Mr. Clifford. My doors arie closed against the world,; but if you choose to come now and then, they shall open to you. Because you have that face, it will not be painful to me to welcome you; but you will be pleased to remember that I put no trust in you as a  friend, and that though I may taJk most freely with you, and feel safe in so doing, no act of treachery on your part, no future change, or unkindness, or wrong, will ever take me by surprise.. We will be  'acquaintances,' and as pleasant ones as we can well be; but out of this room you shall never influence my life, nor will I ever influence yours. Do you agree to those terms?"  "What can have made you so suspicious? Why should you think every human being perfectiy untrue? I have heard before that this was your creed, but I never believed it!' "Believe it now.

"All women deerve that .name I    Well, do you agree to those terms?" "To any; so that I may see you again !" "Take care!

Come out next week, if you have nothing better to do, and show me what you have done with Zen- bia!"   He made his adieu somewhat silently, and took baok to his lodgings a vision of that arch smile and those mischievous eyes that boded ill for his future peace of mind.   CHAPTER IL. Those sweet brown eyes! they smile on me, And I smile back again ; Yet, in that very glance, I see The shadow of a pain! Those eyes have loved-those eyes have wept. Still, looking into mine,  They lift their free glance gloriously, And are too proud to pine!-M. B.   Six weeks passed by.  The new play of "Zenobia" had been eminently successful, and Clifford, as its author, was lionized and made much of in circles he had 'never dreamed of entering before. To have written the play was much; but to have written-1for Regina-to be enveloped in the blaze of her glory-was far more; and even Mrs. Erlinford followed the stream of fashion, and crowned the young hero with laurels by her matter-of-fact praise. And Clifford accepted his success with a meek con- seiousndess of merit, that procured him many a lecture from Regina, who averred that, but for her, he would be entirely spoiled. I think she was- right. Forgetting that the good people of London are very much like those of Athens in the days of old, for ever on the run after "some new thing," he allowed his vanity to blind him to his peculiar position. After all, it was but natural that he should be elated. It needs thie steadiest of heads, or a heart that has got crushed among the mani- fold wheels -of life's machinery, to bear up against so sudden an elevation. There are very few who do not grow giddy, and play strange pranks before the eyes of gods and  men, when they are snatched out of a dark obscurity, and  suspended, like Mohammed's  coffin, midway between the heavens and the earth--aspiring toward the one, attracted by  the other, yet touching neither. Clifford was , not one of this happy few. The eager boy's  ] heart rejoiced within him at this glorious ful- 1 aigment of the boyish dreams;   the proud I   [ man's spirit rested exultingly in the sunshine for a time, but fluttered its wings now and then, preparing for a bolder flight; the mere human vanity fed, and grew with that it fed upon-the praise, the flattery of women, young and old, titled and beautiful. A coxcomb he could never be i but he could scarcely help feeling conscious, at times, that his form was elegant, his movements graceful, and that his face could charm.  Regina looked with grave eyes at some of Clifford's proceedings during this harvest of good opinion; and yet they were the best of friends. He was often at the little cottage. He gladly gave up grand dinner-parties to share her Barmicidioal meal, or left his place vacant in some opera-box to sit beside her as she sang to her guitar, in the dusky warmth of the spring twilight, the songs that Erlinford had loved. Every one knew this;' and yet, strange to say, every one was'content with'the arrangement. By this time, Scandal's tongue had grown tired; and people found out for themselves' that Regina had really lived a perfectly blame- less life since Lord Erlinford's death, and that the Brompton cottage was no lure far titled roues, but a refuge fora woman who Jad grown weary of the world. No one except Olifford and -the manager ever visited her ; yet there were kind women's hearts yearning over ber- kind .English hearts that col ld, pity her for her loneliness, and that would have overlooked hir fall, if she had. brooked their gentle a(L    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6470-00000015"/> vances. But she would not-she had lived without the world too long ; and though she knew well, as she came before her audience, night after night, how they were learning to value and respect her it last, nothing more than a softened glance, or a brighter smile, at times, betrayed it-nothing wooed that trem- oling sympathy which would so easily have been won. !"The season" was rapidly waning. Regina, worn out with the continual excitement of act- ing, had decreed her "last appearance," and had chosen "' Zenobia" for her benefit-night. The house was crowded. Again Mrs. Erlin. ford sat in her'box with her daughter; but Clifford, as well as Charlemount, bent over felen's chair, and Clifford held the glove and fan she had laid aside. He was looking dream- ily down into the pit, and wondering if it could be possible that he had made one of its con- tented occupants six weeks ago, when her gentle voice broke in upon his reverie, and made him start and draK nearer, to hear what she was saying. '"Are you composing a new play?" she. ask- ed, smilingly slightly; '"for I have spoken to you twice, and you have not deigned to answer me by look, or nod, or sign!" "* I am shocked at my rudeness-I beg ten thousand pardons!" he began, confusedly. "Pray, make   no excuses-they will not mend the matter. But tell me, instead, if you are hearthroken at the thought of losing the beautiful actress-from the stage, I mean?" "' She needs rest, Miss Erlinford." ' No doubt. Yet I am selfish enough to re- gret her going." "But she will come back again." "Ah, Mr. Clifford!" broke in Mrs. Erlinford,  with common-place sentimentality, "so few come back again!"; "True I Yet Regina, let us hope, will not have the heart to desert us. She only goes abroad for tlree months, I believe." "But I   hear she is impulsive, and always following the fancy of the moment--in a word, unsteady. Is it true?"          I "I am afraid it is-in a measure."    ] "  Then, if a whim seizes her to remain on I the Continent, to settle down at Paris, or to E marry, what are we to do?"        i   Clifford started at her last words, and Charle- mount smiled at seeing him. "I think Regina will never marry," he said, quietly. "DIo you not agree with,me, Mr. Clifford?" "I, my lord? H- have formed no opinion on the subject. I cannot say that I have ever thought of It before."' "And yet you know her intimately."   I "Certainly!" was the cold reply. "But we discuss other subjects than that of matrimony when we meet. If shd has any such plane, she has never mentioned them to me. From what I know of her, however-and she is, as you say, my dear and intimate friend-I should conclude that she has no vocation-that is, I do not think she means to marry, now, or at any future time." He bungled and blundered so strangely over the latter part of his speech, that Lord Charle. mount could not help smiling   again; and Helen, turning half-round in her chair, looked at him wonderingly. "Gentlemen," said Mrs. Erlinford, ".you seem quite energetic in your discussion. But you must defer it; .for, see, while you are talk- ing of the Queen of the Night, she begins to shine!"  Even as she spoke, the bell rang, and the curtain rose. They sat down in their places, and watched the play. I have already described Regina as  Mary Stuart." I  have some mercy on my readers, and will not compel them to gaze long upon this passionate Eastern queen. It is enough to say, that the part was fitted 'to the actress, that the audience were delighted, and that even Clifford felt a new affection for the off- spring of his brain, when he saw it animated and informed by the beauty and the fire of her nature, and felt that the Zenobia (of his own dream was but a pale shadow of the Zenohia she had placed upon the stage--living, suffer- lDg, hating, and, at last, dying, before that silent, sympathizing crowd. Zenobia died in want and wretchedness, it is true; but she died, also, clad in the royal robes of former days, and with the crown upon her brow. It was thus that they saw her stretched upon the pallet in her tent, the rec- reant husband at her feet, and the -ArabiaSn   eteed bending his graceful head over her in a mute, sorrowful farewell.: Crowned, and in the pdrple still, she came before the curtain to re- ceive their homage after the play had ended. In after days, how many recalled her to mem- ory, standing alone, with flowers at her feet, and diamonds on her brow-pale, but beauti- ful, and looking, with a gaze that had some- thing of sadness in it, around that crowded house! Did any presentiment cross her mind, as she made her brief and silent farewell?Did any revealing of the future flash upon her vision, as she gazed upon th e box where Clif- ford, and Lord Charlemount, and Helen Erlin- ford sat? No ; she little dreamed of all that lay before her. She little thought how great a change was coming, even then, over her own ife, and. hear, and theirs. The shadow of a cloud rose in her sky, but the cloud itself was hidden. The first breeze of the coming storm ruffled the calm waters of the bay, but they still broke gently on the sunny shore.;- the hush of the approaching tempest in the eam- mer air seemed only the pause of the light wind to rest among the flowers. "Regina!   Regina l' cried the crowd, with friendly accents. "Regina!' said the eyes of Charlemount and the smile-of Clifford; "Re- gina!" the little bouquet of roses, shining with a single pearl, like a dewdrop, that fluttered down from  Helen's hand, a messenger of peace andsrgood-will. Yes,  ' Regina " to the last, queen of the stage, and queen of those throb. - bing human hearts! The gemmed crown and. the purple robe, the flowers at her feet, and the eager faces, and the still more eager cries i of kindly feeling and farewell--they were the fitting close to the splendor of her artist-life. She passed from the stage with a tender, grate-  ful smile-the gentlest look they had ever seen I upon her face; .and neither she nor they dream- I ed for an instant that she would never tread i the boards again! , they had one more glimpse of her that ' night, however, and in a  new position. It had.  been observed by many, as Zenobia r'eclined l on her cushions in the "Hall of Thirty Foun- I tains," while a  band of dancing-girls performed  their graceful evolutions before her, that- he ..t eye followed one, pre-eminent above all the I rest for the lightness of her movements and the ;4 beauty of her form. This dancer, -afterward v   a 'the rival who banished her from heart, and e home, and throne, was the object of her peeu- liar attention, whenever they were on tth stage together. Wherever those flyinag feet twinkled, they were followed by Zenobia's eyes; and the danseuse herself saw it, and redoubled her. efforts to fascinate and to please. Sometimes, when she found that searching, thoughtful Iglance fixed upon her face. she trembled and turned pale; sometimes she blushed; but al- ways her own eyes answered baok, with a look of admiration and interest, that would have been love if it had dared. For six weeks this little play within a play. hadbeen enaeted; and ballet-girls, and actors, and audience were alike eonscious of it; and many  were the speettlations about Regina's thoughts, many the wonderings if the twoj so evidently inter- ested in each other, would ever speak or meet, except upon the boards. Neither ever mfen' tioned the  other's name; Regina aslied no questions of the manager or Clifford about the girl; she knew all of Regina that the world knew, iand, sought to know no more. On this night, she danced in the "Hall of Thirtv Foun- tains, and won' the monarch by her smiles, and triumphed over the dying queen for the last time.  Standing at the side scents, she waited for Fegina, a sehe eame from before the ' curtain. A little group of daneing girls linger ed hear;   she put out her hand as Zenobia- swept proudly by, and timidly touched the purple robe. It was her own silent adieu-un- noticed she also intended it to be; hut the actress stopped and turned 'toward heit. Was' she about to  speak? 'No I She only smiled slightly, waved her hand, and passed on. Gone, without a word--gone, it might be, for ever! Something like a, tear stood in the girl's eye, but tthe call-boy summoned -her to dress for a new part in the ballet, and it had no time to fall. No farce followed Regina's plays. In their place was given ag ballet of unusual length, carefully prepared by the manager and his dramatic author. On this iighti ,Undine " was to be performed for the first time, and/to "' The Zephyr "(so the danelF had'been ninied upon. the play bills) the principal part :hd ; been assigned. It was rumored that the ebllk. had been got up at unusual expeise, and"With unusual care, and that the Zephyr intended to ,'    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6470-00000016"/> make a most triumphant debut. Hitherto, she had been but one among the ranks; this night- was to elevate her above, her companions, or keep her in the ranks for ever. Many lingered, good-naturedly anxious to support and encourage the novice; among these were the occupants of Mrs. Erlinford's box. And the few who were preparing for de- parture suddenly secured their seats again, with eager and astonished looks. A rumor ran from pit to gallery that Regina herself was in the house, waiting, behind the curtains of the manager's box, to witness the ballet! Eyes and opera-glasses from all directions turned that way. Yes-she was therel only half-concealed by the transparent screen, read. ing the bill for the evening as composedly as any other play-goer might have done I The manager was not with her, .but a little brown. faced woman, attired in a sober-colored silk, sat at the other side of the box, in full view of every one; and the white dog, Mary Stuart's "Prince Charlie," rested his muzzle on the crimson-velvet cushion, and looked composed- ly grand, with his dark, intelligent. eyes.. It was comical to see the intense interest with which people noted all these little things. The dog and Madame Prudence seemed to en- joy the attention they attracted with philoso- phical composure. Perhaps nothing astonished the owners of the opera-glasses ,and the eyes more than to find so little difference between the actress and the woman.. There she sat, proud and beauti- ful as ever-no less Zenobia that the robe and crown were gone-no-less Mary Stuart that' the scaffold and the block were wanting. Her dress was of the simplest fashion,.though of rich material; and, to the surprise of all, the beautiful neck and -arms were closeIv covered. A  Greek jacket and vest of black velvet re- lieved the full, plain skirt of the same material. The sleeves of the jacket, and its edges, were marked by a single cord of crimson; the pointed lace collar was confined by a ruby, cut in the shape of a crescent, and two tiny ruby stars fastened the filmy, beautifully-wrought sleeves.  A foreign flower, whose blood-red petals drooped like dagger-points, relieved the intense blackness of-her braided hair. Other gems or ornament she had none, except the plain gold ring which never left her hand. Yet   it was curious how, in this quiet garb, her regai air and peculiar loveliness seemed to find their beet expression.- No woman looked on her without a feeling of envy-no man, without subscribing heartily to that hackneyed idea that beauty is most adorned when wearing its simple mantle of hodden gray. Mrs. Erlinford 4and Helen watched her with a peculiar interest. The manager's box was -almost directly opposite their own; their glasses brought her as near as if she had been sitting beside them. Helen gazed nervously, quite prepared to drop her glass if Regina- stirred; but Mrs. Erlinford leaned easily back in her chair, and stared like a true-born Briton, taking the goods her gods provided her, and fully conscious that she was getting .her "money's worth," at least, that night. When the first long survey was over, she turned to Clifford, whose eyes were also fixed upon her: "Well, Mr. Clifford, you are right; she is handsome."  "I thought you would -acknowledge its one day., "And I like the jway in which she sits there. She takes no notice of any of us; she is quiet and lady-like in her appearance-more so than most women would be in her position." "Yes." And Clifford looked angrily at Lord Charlemount, whose face wore a peculiar ex- pression as he gazed his fill. *Regina is thoroughly lady-like, and knows how to ignore and resent all. presumption as well as any one I ever met." The earl dropped his eye-glass, and twned sharply rofed, as if he fancied more in the words than met his ear. Meeting- Clifford's eye, he smiled, and listened quietly to Mrs. Erlinford, who seemed possessed with a- de- vouring curiosity. "Do  tell me, since you know her so well, Air. Clifford, does she always dress in that peculiar style?" "I believe so. At least, I have never seen' her in any other colors." "'Black and crimson!   Very odd, but also very becoming.  A Greek dress! But Regina is a Parisian. And the flower in her hair-I never, saw one like it before. What is it, Mr. Clifford?." "I hate heard, but I forget its name at -this moment."   "A foreign flower, of course?" i "I think she found theiri in her Texan gar- dens. She keeps them in her conservatory, for the' sake of that land which she says is 'brighter than England.' I have seen the plant growing. It reaches the height of two or three feet, and the blossoms hang in large heart-shaped clusters. They have a peculiar fragrance, too. You will laugh, but, I assure you, as I look at it from this distance, 1 could almost fancy I inhaled it now." Helen fixed her eyes upon the crimson flower with a dreamy glance. "But you forget its name?" "I do. Shall I ask it of Regina--or, better, shall I bring you one of the flowers?" "I should like it much, Mr. Clifford. And - and-please ask her to gather it for you." ': I will do so, without fail." ' Oh, Mr. Clifford, that reminds me!" ex- claimed Mrs. Erlinford. "Does Regina ever wear jewels?" "Never, I believe, except on the stage." "How very odd!" "Indeed, I never saw her with any ornament until to-night. The flower, at times-but the , rubies are strangers to me." "And that peculiar dress I  Do you know, Mr. Clifford, I feel' more interest in her than ever, now.  Is that her companion?" "Yes;   that is Madame Prudence--half nurse and   half adopted mother;  and the quaintest, brightest little Frenchwoman I ever saw.   She is as gay as a bird-I think nothing could make her unhappy." "Unless Regina died!" said Helen, thought- fully. Clifford started; but the curtain rose, and -he could not reply. He  drew back into the shade, and watched Regina with other feelings than he had known before. In the first place, he was jealous, although he could scarcely ac- i knowledge it, even to himself; And jealous of what?   t was very difficult to say. He only X felt aggrieved because Regina felt so utterly un- I conscious of his presence. He knew well that j she would not allow him to enter her box;. but i he felt that she ought to have recognized him X in some way-might simply have  raised her I syes, or smiled, as if to say: ,; I know that you 1 are there, and I  am glad we/ are going to enjoy 1   this ballet together ;" but she never turned his - way. She sat with her cheek resting on her, ,: 'hand, looking eteadily at Undine and the train B of attendant water sprites. No doubt they were very pretty and graceful; but why could ,she not spare one thought for him?--why  could she not share her pleasure with one who had shared so many of her simple pursuits ii her own home'? Thus he fretted and fumed quite conscious that if Helen Erlinford were in question, he should never dream of receiving such a manifestation of her affection for him; but not wise enough to understand that Regina, putting herself in that private position, as- sumed all the privileges of -a lady, and would haVe died rather than yield one of them. He ,never understood her; but at this moment he was further than ever from appreciating the delicacy of her reserve, or the greatness of her pride. His vanity was hurt because she made no sign.    - Then, again, he  remembered  Miae Erlin- ford's words: "If the whim seizes her to marry, what are we to do?"Sure enough l And, above all, what was he to do? He had never thought of marrying her himself, it is true, dearly as he loved her; but what warrant had 'he that others were equally indifferent? The Earlof Charlemount, who had been wont to applaud the Zephyr night   after night, scarcely looked at her now, so intent was he upon Regina's face; yet he knew, as well as Clifford, that Diana herself would as soon be- come his idol .of the moment. What if he were dreaming of her, even then, as the future Countess of!Charlemount, ready to purchase her with a coronet, if she was to be tempted in no other way! He   actually trembled at the thought. And she-she sat socalmly there, with Erlinford's ring upon her hand, and Er. linford's brother watching her-looking only at Undine, evidently. thinking of no one hilt Undine.   Confound the water-nymph and all akin to her! Certainly, it was no' amiable humor into which our poor Clifford had fallen. At one and the same moment, hs consigned- the German nymp I and  the Earl of Charle. mount to the halls opf Eblis; and made up his mind that he..would ask Regina to ,be his, wfe  before twentjyfour hours had passed over hhi head.    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6470-00000017"/> Meanwhile, Regina gazed at Undine with het heart in her eyes. Some peculiar beauty in the girl's changeful face had puzzled her from their first meeting; she saw now what the charm had been. The 'Zephyr's form was somewhat fragile; her face colorless, but lit up with large brown eyes, that sparkled and beamed like stars-no, that is too cold a simile for orbs like thesel They were deep-they were still-they were soft and shining; they resembled lonely mountain-tarns, into whose waters no human eyes have ever looked. With those wondrous eyes went a no less wondrous fall of hair, matching them perfectly in hue, and covering the slight shoulders with a wavy mass, almost like curls, but softer and more beautiful than curls could have been, As she  rose from the mimic brook beside the fisher- man's cottage, with that beautiful hair un- bound, and crowned with water-lilies-her flow. ing robes of white, her pure,pale cheek, and upraised eyes-a murmur of delight and sur prise broke from the audience.: She seemed unlike a human being, and crossed the stage lightly arid glidingly, like a spirit in a dream. Even Clifford was won from his moody reverie by Helen's undisguised delight, and made to lean forward to look at her. ' Why have we never appreciated her. be- fore?' exc!aimcd Helen. ' She danced beauti- fully, it is true, in the 'Hall of the Fountains,' but not like this. Mamma, are you looking?" "Yes, my dear." "And do you not agree with me?' "She dances well: I never thought one could do it with long trailing robes before." "It is a fairy by moonlight!--it is Titania herself!" exclaimed the enraptured Helen. The ballet concluded in the chamber of the false knight and his beautiful bride. Undine's song was heard long before her face was seen by that terrified couple. The lady leaned up- ,n her husband's arm for support-his eyes irned always to the open door. Slowly float- d through it that lovely, sorrowful figurer- slowly fell the' petals of the white lilies from her waving hair-sad were the words she sung, and. sad her parting glance. Out into the moonlit courtyard again, like a spirit of the night-the fountain sparkled and flashed at her very feet-one look was cast toward the   casement of his chamber, and the white robes vanished. Undine could love and could suffer on earth no more  The curtain fell, and Regina leaned from her box, and applauded gently with her gloves hands. A tempest seemed to shake the houes at this generous act, and Undine's name rang out as loudly as hers had ever done. Blush- ing and trembling, the young debutante came forward. Her first glance was at Mrs. Erlin- ford's box; her second, at the manager's. Charlemount smiled to himself. Such wreaths and bouquets as had not been exhausted for Regina came fluttering now upon the stage. Regina herself took the crimson flower from her hair, and threw-it down at Undine's feet. Their eyes met--Regina made a hasty motion with her hand, and raising the flower to her lipsi the danseuse courtesied profoundly to the audience, and withdrew. "Undine! and Regina!"The names were coupled together in that last burst of applause; but no one answered it. The little Frenchwoman and her canine charge vanished as if by magic-the chair of the actress was vacant; and Clifford, going around to the private entrance, after he had handed Miss Erlinford to her carriage, saw the well- known brougham in waiting, but could gain no tidings of its mistress. She was in her dressing-room, the coachman fancied; he thought she had stopped to speak to some one, but could not exactly say. Tired of waiting, and more jealous and unreasonable than ever, after the mention-of that mysterious "some one," Clifford strolled toward home, half inclined to wish he: had never seen her-- half longing to go back and throw himself at, her feet, and tell her all before the morning broke--but wholly miserable -and. restless, as people who are in love det us thank the fates, 'dear reader, that we are not of that unlucky number 1) must forever be I Regina, passing out through the wings, found Undine waiting, with the crimson flower in her haqd, and took her to her own, dressing-room, much to the surprise of the departing ballet- girls, to whom that region was a kind of inac- cessible fairy-land. A good fire. blazed upon the hearth; and Madame Prudence entering after them, drew the sofa toward it, and dis- erectl retired with Fidele to the extreme end   of the apartment. Regina seated herself, and drew the 'young girl down beside her, almost caressingly. "Child, how you tremble, and how pale you are! One would imagine you a water-sprite in reality. Are you going to melt away at my feet in a miniature cascade? What ails you?" Her tone was s8 friendly, that Undine took courages and looked up into her face, "Are you afraid of me?" "Not now?" "You need not be. I am not in the habit of eating, people-not even beautiful ballet-danc- ers. Look up and-talk to me." ( What can I say, that you would care to hear?" "Very much, if you choose. In the first place, have you any home? I mean, have you a home of your own-with parents-with friends?" "I never knew my parents, and I have no friends," said the girl, sadly  "Never knew them?  Even if you have never seen them, you must know something of them-eh?"  She shook her head. !"Madame, I am a foundling." "Heavens! the turn at the convent gate!" exclaimed Madame Prudence, who was prick- ing up her ears in the corner. "Scarcely, I think," said Regina, smiling. "They have no convents -here-at least, none of those you are thinking of. But explain yourself, my dear child. We do not quite un- derstand." "I was left at a door-in a basket," said the girl, coloring painfully.'  "Ah, I seel And the good man of the 1 house, finding you there, said-what did he t say, my dear?" "  That I must go to the asylum, I suppose;  for when I was old enough to ascertain my whereabouts, I was there."      . "' You have no reason to believe that you  were left at yourfather's door?" asked Regina,  with emphasis; and Undineldrew up her pret t ty head with a naive smile.  "They found me before a baker's shop, m a -a dame, and he was dead. The business was oar- I ied on by his widow."       .. ," Then it was the baker's lady who decided h your destiny?"  8   .      \   3 I "It was." t  "Women have tender hearts., I wonder she did not keep you." "She had a large family-she was very 3 poor." "You have seen her since, then?" "Yes!" was the hesitating answer. "One r canot help having some feeling for places and persons' so connected with their own lives; and I have often stopped before her windows, sim. ply that I might see her through the glass. She is a large, fat woman, and she wears spec- tacles, and takes snuff. But she looks kind, madame; and you will laugh, I think, when ., tell you, that. I long, when sad and lonely, to go in and speak to her-to tell her that I am that little child, and to beg her to say one en- couraging word to me. I know she would do it!" "It is a good heart i" murmured Prudence, quite audibly. Regina did not laugh. She was looking in the speaker's face with a curious expression on her own; and touching the 'brown hair softly with her hand as she listened, "It sometimes happens to you, then?'" "What, madame?" "To be sad and lonely." The brown eyes drooped till the long lashes swept the clear, pale cheek. She made a little passionate gesture with her hand. "Madame, I have been alone all my life." "That cannot have been very long.'i "Eighteen years." "Well l" "And during seven of them I have been miserable. I was not very happy as a child ; but now-but now-I wish often, as I qross the bridges, to jump from one of them, and so end it alt'L"  "Poor child!" The girl looked up a moment in her Gcee then leaned her cheek upon the hand that caressed her, and burst into a perfect passioR of weeping.

In a little while, the paroxysm passed away, and she leaned against Regina's shoulder, * quiet, but drawing a heavy breath that became s sob, now -and the, like a child that had cried itself to sleep. ' Rest," said Regina, when she would have risen. "We have not finished what we were saying." "Oh, what must you think of me." ( Shall I tell you? My heart has ached of- ten-perhaps as yours is aching now; and I  would have given worlds to shed such tears, hbut I could not. I used to sit like a block of stone, till the pain wore itself out I You have an easier way of getting rid of it. Are you happier now." "While you hold me like this-while you speak to me so kindly-I seem to be in Para-. dise." * "A B the way, what is your name--your real name?"               " They called me Ruth." "They? *Who?" "The people at the asylum. I think it was the matron." 'Nothing more than that?" "Nothing." "Ruth I Ruth!" said, Regina, smiling. "A quaint little name-and yet I think it suits you. I expected something different; .but it matches those * bonnie wells of eyes.' Well, Ruth, after all, this world is not so bad, a place as people make it out to be." "t Only very hard, very cold, very wicked, and very cruel!" "Ahl you are prejudied, just now; and perhaps it is natural. But I shall live, I hope, to hear you sing a very different song; ay, and sind it merrily, too!" Ruth was silent; but she looked- very skep- tical. Nothing is so difficult as to make a heart, bleeding from its first wound, believe in the exnstence of future happiness. "Only eighteen!" said Regina; " only eight- een I Beautiful, and a successful debutante! Yet she talks of throwing herself into the Thames, and breaks her heart because the oaker's wife, who has never seen her since her   departute in a basket, does. not reeognize her It Are you not ashamed of yourself, Ruth?" "Yes, a little 1" "Well, to reward you for that candtd aon- fessioo, I have something to. propose to you, But, first, tell me, how you came. upon the stage?"         ,  Ruth turned searlet. "Madame, H-." "D on't call me madame I Say, Regina!" "Regina, they put me out to service!" "Well I what else, could they do with you?' '-'.Nothing, I confess. But I did nothke ii. It was a housemaid's place, and, I was expected to wash the dishes and' scrub the, floors ." And she looked so disgusted, that both Re- gina and Prudence laughed heartily. "Well, Ruth, and did you do it?"' "Not very long. H-I ran away." "Ah I And then?" "I--I found a friend." Regina looked very grave.  And-and I studied under the best profes- sors, and, finally, came here." There was a long silence. Ruth's'face was crimson, and her eyes averted. Regina'was very sad. She had hoped; for different things but she knew as well as if the word had been spoken, what Ruth intended she should sur- mise, from her incoherent explanation. Still, there was time. She might save her from a worse fate. And, after all, what right:had she to east the first stone, or to wonder, even for &amp; ^ moment, that another had enteredf the by-and forbidden paths in which she herself had walk- ed. She took Ruth'shand' in- both her own, and looked at her, 'with a sigh. . "My dear, the poet was right," she said, in a lo-id, voioe. "The trail of the serpent, i' over all earth's brightest and most beautiful blossoms." "Was I wrong -in telling you this?" mur- mured Ruth, with her lips close atgRegina's ear, as No-as you will say, soon. You have Bad- dened me ; but that matters little. Godk;nows I cannot reprove you!" "I' am sorry-I am sorry amsor W"Wi! you answer me one question, Ruth 1' "As many as you like."' "Is- this man your friend still?"   r No."  In the dreary tone and the long-drawn sigh, Regina read the whole story. Ruth had been eserted. "Can you forget him?" "I have been trying. e But it is very, very hard." "And that is where you got the proud look in your eyes-that is why the bed of the river seemed a pleasant refuge?" "Yes."- "Very natural, but very foolish, Ruth. You and I have both sinned-rwe have both suffer- oed; but my pangs were over before yours commenced. I. will do all I can to comfort you, if you will let me. You say you have no home?"  "Only my lodgings.", "Bah! put- them  out of the question. I have a home. I am   rich, and happy after a fashion of my own.. Prudence, there, is to me like a mother. Prince Charlie loves me; so does mwyhorse; and my birds, "my cat, and my tame raven are all fond: of me in their way. Still, there is a vacant place in my life. I think often that I must fill it, not with a lover, but with a friend.  Will 'you be that friend, Ruth?"- "I!" She started from her recumbent position in utter. surpriLe. Regina rose, and leaned. upon the mantelpiece, gazing intently upon her. "Yes-you, Ruth."              1 "Is it possible that you mean it'?"  "Ask Prudence." "Indeed, mademoiselle, Regina mentioned it I to me the very evening that she saw you- first; * That, was why you watched: me so, then P' "It wasi - It has been the .dream of this last part of my life to find a woman. like you; but .r I never fanied that dream would become real- ity, till we met." "( But what can you tee in me?, In me?"  And poor Ruth looked down upon her flow- 9t ing white robes, as if she expected- they would disclose the charm that had made this bright  and radiant creature love her.       ho "Not much," said Regina, with a fond smile. 'w "Only a  mind at once profound and delieate - ra a   nature at once strong and refined-and a   heart^ah, Ruth.

"Farewell-a long farewell--to all my great- ness!" she exclaimed, waving her hand. "I wonder how long it will be before I shall enter here again, Ruth?" Then they took their departure. The white horse, under the charge of its own groom, had preceded them; and when the carriage halted before the gateof the cottage, the animal put his head against the lattice, and gave a low whinny of delight. "Look, Ruth 1" said Regina, as they went up to him: " the foolish fellow will never go to his stable till he has said good-night to me. Are you afraid of him?" "No. Why do you ask?" "I thought I saw you shrink away from him. one night on the stage."' "I remember. I came too near, and he nearly stepped on my foot." U Well, be friends with him now I He will shake hands with you, if you like. Saladin, Greet her I' The beautiful creature lifted his delicate hoof and placed it daintily in Ruth's hand, tossing up his head at the same moment, as she played with his flowing mane. Regina looked on very proudly. The Arabian was the prime Cavor- ite of all her dearly-loved pets.* ,' Good-night, my beautiful!" she murmur- ed,pressing her lips to the starry eirelet on his forehead, and letting him eat a piece of sugar from her hand. "I will cnae to you when the morning bleaks."   Prudence entered the house--the carriage drove around to the stables-,but they lingered on in the moonlight, looking at Saladin and Prince Charlie, who were crossing the lawn with the groom.   - * "Hot fond you are of animals l" said Ruth. "Yes; it is my weak point. As for the horse, I fear, at times, I make an idol of him. But he is so graceful-so beautiful- so loving and intelligent-that I look upon him more as a human being than as a brute! No--I'll not call him by that name. v My Saladin a brute! I have seen brutes in, my lifetime, but they never walked on four legs-never!" "I thought his name was--" Ruth checked herself suddenly. "Alfred?" said Regina, calmly. "It was, at first. Lord Edlinford wished it so. But since I came to England, I have called him Saladin, after one of my old ideals. Pretty creaturel See him turn to give us a last adieu. Good-night, my pet-good-night!" Ruth could not help smiling. "Ah, you are laughing at my enthusi as m You do not underatand it; and I hope you never may." i' Why?" "To love animals as I love them, one must first have got completely out of joint with the rest of animated Nature. It is a pleasure be- yond words, but it only comes after pain- such pain, little one, as I do not mean you to know anything about. But we will leave Sal- adin'and his mates. Look around, and tell me how you like our home." "It is very pleasant. A homne indeed l" "Yes ; I flatter myself that it is not much amiss.!Look at this vine over our heads When we return home from Italy, in the au tumn, we shall have grapes as large as plums." "We are going to Italy, then?" "Of eourse. And to a thousand other places which I have often longed to visit. I have only been waiting for my companion. I am not sure that I shall not give you a peep at my little villa in Texas, before we return. The World is all before us, Ruth-at least, till winter comes again; and we are going to enjoy ourselves vastly!" "I hope so." ! Hand-in hand, they went down the garden-   walk. The moonlighlt shone on the dancing waters of the fountain, the trees ruetled over herad in the night windl, and no other sound, except the poll of a distant carriage, or the step of the policeman pacing up and down the lane, broke the stillness. Ruth gazed at the" bright sky and the falling water with a de- lighted smile.  "O Reging, I never knew the world was half so beautiful as this!" "I dare say not, yokpoor little London prudel! I am gtad to get) you out of thatf dingy city. t am glad you love flis place. Look at that moon! I think, sometimes, she keeps, her brightest light for my garden, be- cause she knows bow thoroughly I appreciate it. Are you sleepy, Ruth?" "Oh, nol  I shall never want to sleep again."  "You wil. begin to nod in an hour. But see the fountain!" An arch has been newly raised above its brim, qoaintly wrought in old Gothic Ioints and crosses, and surmounted by a marble figure-a snow-white doe-whose graceful head was beat, as if to crop the lilies at her feet. Regina took the drinking-cup from its niche, filled it, and presented it to her companion. "Now, wish before you drink!" "Yes."      : She paused a moment--a serious look came \ over her face-then she lifted the cup to her lIps .  "You must not tell your wish to me 1" "I know. Yet you would be pleased with  E it, ^n I think it will be granted."   B "' Very well-wait and see. Oh. what a night it is! And how happy I am!" she added leaning gently on Ruthis shoulder. "rPosi-  tivelv, I am unable to frame a wish for any. n thing, or any person, beyond these walls. I f  eel like a little child, Ruth-a child let loose h from school, and ready to run and play." R Ruth's cloak slid from her shoulders to the ground. Some of the water-lilies still lingered sl in her hair  , and her white garments looked c silvery in the moonlight. "Undine!-and by the fountain!" exelaimed R Regina. "'Let us dance!" t. "Dance I D  o y ou dane ?"      ^ t "You forget that I am a Frenchwoman, and   ig naturally gifted with the lightest of toes and rP-. heels.

Regina proved the truth - of hep assertion. She danced as only a French. woman aan dance; and Ruth was delighrted. f Faster and faster, the swaying motion. ehalgedd into a bona fide waltz; an they flew up ana n, down the graveled walk'as if they had wines, I .their fresh voices, and sweet, low laughter, fall-  ing pleasantly on the quiet air. Ruth was the e first to s'op. Regina, flushed with the exer- - cise, and mischievous as a child, snatched up I the cloak from beneath her feet, and pointed to the house. "Can you run?" "Like a lapwing i"            ; "We will have a race, then, to the hall-door, and she who reaches it first shall have the largest bird at supper! Start fair lt Ooa- two--three! . Now!" Away they went, and, coming upon'the door at the same moment, precipitated themselves into the hall with such a tumult of laughter, that Prudence uttered a shriek, and ran out from the- study, under the impression that thieves had broken in. "Al, my dear!" she said, shaking her head in pretended rebuke, " it is well we have no neighbors." "Right I But we are going to be very good and very still now..

The box was opened--t Was full of delicate cigarettes, such  as the Mexican ladles use. I learned it in Texas," she said, apologet- ically, as Ruth looked on in astonishmet. "The example is a. bad one. I do not. advise you to follow it. But"try the wine-it came from the famous oellr in'Breemen, and might be liquid gold, for the price I paid.".

The words hsv6 touched me to the heart, ThoUgh they are sad and few, Aid all that Leollne *88s to im, fain would be-toyou i"     . B.   On the day after Regina's last appearasne, Helen Erlinford eat id the pretty little boudoit dedicated 'to herself, and 'suh friends as she choie to admit to share her privacy. Mr. Er- linford, seated in her own, especial arm-chair, was comfortably peru6ing thePost, in her tiorn- ing room outside, and making comments, now and then, to her daughter, through the halt-open door. Helen listened, and replied dutifully, yet her thoughts seemed busy with other things' and she laid aside her pencil not and theh, ahnd leaned her cheek upon her hand, with a far- away look in her beautiful eyes. The table in the middle of the. room was covered with portfolios and unfinished sketches, ,*nd at a tiny easel sat Helen, Working on a pic- ture of a New-]tngland farm house in the dead of winter, which she Was endeavoring to portray from Charlemont's written description at her side, The six Weeks had tnade almost as great a. change in Helen as in Regina. The aetress bad been growing good and gentle: Helen needed not to do this, and o "she touched upos a more foolish extreme--she had been grbowig sad.  No doubt she would have started in surprise at I uch a thought, bu'it tans ttiue. The heart of i the woman was aWakenin frt oit its long 'sleep, and, like all other children, it murmured at being disturbed, and needed the soothing words  whie' must cobiie froir othert lips thLn heres.

The blue eyes sparkled still, at e times, with light and laughter, but they had also aeqired a dreamy glance;' the red lils wsettled in a 'rmer curve, the graceful head w"a often bent in thought, ahd a'peculiar. air of subdued and half-imphsBioned tenderness made her a diffbrent being tob the gay girl who hal smiled down at Regina ,on theb night of her debut. "He loves me not," was Uppermost fi her thoughts. You could see it in her listless attitude on that morning, as, leaning on her folded arms, she turned her head slightly to- ward the door, and listened to what her mother was saying. "That odious Lady Blanche, my dear-.I am eure she *ll -eeure him unless you bestir yourself, a;nd taketnore pains to please him." "But wht am i to do, namnma .?"seid Helen, afraid to confess that, in consequence of her reverie, she had not the remoteat idea who 4 he" was. "DOb   ftave I not een telling you for the last half-hour?" and Mrs; Eflinford rose and bistled in with the paper in her hand. * flelbn, I think you will break my heart-el think yO6 are asleep-' " -"n, maietf a." ...  "It amounts to thetame thing. When yo . begin painting I never can. lake you Baty five words. What are yobu a oking at?"  "The Ne' England fan-house Charlemotnt d'esribed to ile."  "Ah!   trememei,' ad Mrs. EPlinford look    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6470-00000021"/> ed gratified. "He is to have it when it is' finished-is he not?" "Yes."  , And when will that be ." "I cannot tell," said Helen languidly. I I amt afraid I am not quite right about it, and he promised to show me-to tt-11 me more. Do you think it will do, mamma?", "My dear child, what on earth do I know about New England farm-houses? Aek him." " I will, when he comes." "That will be very soon. I saw him at D--  House last night, and he sent a message to you that he should come to-day to help you with it." "It is very kind of him," said Helen, taking up her brush again. "I am glad you acknowledge it. I think it something more than kind. Helen was silent. "Is it likely that any one sought after, as Charlemount is, would spend whole hours here with us, if there was no attraction greater than he finds elsewhere? I am not vain enough to believe he comes for the sake of an old lady like myself. Do. you hear me, Helen?" "i Yes, mamma." "Tell me what you think of it yourself?" Charlemount is very fond of me, mamma." '"Oh, you confess it?" "And'I love him very much." Mrs. Erlinford smiled, but looked a little shocked. Is My dear child, love him as much as you like, but never say eo ; at least till he has given youwthe right to do so, by asking you to marry him." "t He will never do that, mamma!" 4"What do you mean?" Helen put down her brush, and took her mother's hand in both hers. "You know Charlemount has been like my brother, always." "Nonsense I He is not your brother; and so there 4i no earthly reason why you should not marry." "One, my dear mother." ;' And. pray, what is that?'. "We do not love each other in that way." ' In what way, Miss Erlinford? Pray, wha do you know about love? How can you tell if   there are more ways than one? I am quite su.' prised at you! Helen, you talk like a romantic school-girl. You know it ,is the dearest wish I have to see you his wife; and why cannot you be reasonable and marry him? The love will come afterward and, I am sure, when I mar- ried your father, I did not care two straws for him, and yt you see how happily we have lived together." Helen smiled in her heart at her mother's idea of marriage, though her face was grave. "But, mamma, you don't understand I It is not only .me H-Charlemount. only cares for me as a sister!"      '   ' "How do you know?" "He treats me like one. He pets me ; he lectures me, if I am naughty; he gives me bon. bons and presents when I am good; and I should not be at all surprised if he took it into his head to bring me a doll some day. I am like a favorite little sister to him, that it all." "How can you be so absurd, Helen? As if Lord Charlemount was a man to look upon a girl, young and beautiful as you are, simply as sister! As for petting you, he would pet a queen, if he was in love with! one, and she would allow it." "I think he is," said Helen, rather india tinctly. "Is what?" - "In love with a queen!" , Helen, do you know at all what you are talking about? I am shockedtat you I  Is n'o her majesty a wife and a mother? And get you-" "My dear mamma! how you mistake me! I said a queen!.and I was thinking of Mary Stuart-of Zenobia-of Regina, in fact." Mrs. Erlinford drew a long satisfied breath. "Ah I light breaks in upon me, at last! You are jealous, Helen!" "Indeed, nod!"   a , "Of course, you will iot own it," said he mother, kissingher, with a playful smile. I But you are a little goose for allowing such thoughts to take, possession of you. Of oourse, he admires Regina. No one could help that- leAt of all, I should faney, a man like oharle- mount. But, after all, what harm can that do-? What result -an come from it?, He can never   nmeet her; for all London knows that no one is allowed to, enter the cottage-gates, except the manager--who is a steady, married man-and Clifford, who is to her what you declare poor Geolrge must be to you--a brother." A very vivid crimson 'burned on Helen's cheeks, and she would not meet her mother's eyes when she had finished speaking, "No wonder you blush, my dear! It is quite absurd for you to imagine-such a thing. No, trust me, George knows better what he is about. As for the stories about his first wife, I am sure they were all false. To be sure, we saw nothing of her, as we were abroad all that time; butJ do not believe George would harm - a fly.. At all events, I should be willing to trust you to him. He is always gentle and good with you; and I shall live to see you as happy as Darby and Joan, one day, at Charle-  mount Court. For you must allow, my dear child, that--" More she would have said, but she was checked by the opening of the outer door, and ' Lord Charlemount and Mr. Clifford" were an- nounced in a stentorian voice by the "servant in waiting. Helen started, and clasped her small white hands.  "Oh, mamma!"  "Hush! sit down and compose yourself-they I shall not come- in here just yet," whispered Mrs Erlinford; and sailing into the outer room, d she greeted her callers with her blandest air, Is -and -managed to keep them in conversation for g nearly ten minutes. Still Helen did not appear, a and Charlemount, who waswandering up and ox down the room  like a troubled spirit, asked fa bluntly-" where she was hiding herself.' , n "Not far away," said Mrs. Erlinford, rising with a smile: ", we will allgo and find her. Mr. w Clifford, I believe you have never entered si Helen's boudoir before?"         y  "I have never had that honor, madam ?" sh "Come, then.'             be She opened the door.,          bl" "     Helen, my dear, if you are'not too busy to relcome somea friends--- ';for "Oh, no, mammaj" said Helen, 'extremely thankful that Charlemount bad not found his sai way alo0ne.

It had been lying in his heart for many days, but this was the first moment in which he had fairly looked it in the face. ' Well, Miss Erlinford," said Lord Charle. mount, ," how does the picture progress?" "Very slowly." "What is the matter!' "Look!"              . ' He bent over the easel. "I see nothing-ah, yes, you have had a London  og in your mind, Helen.  New Eng- land skies are not like that; they are blue-- blue as your eyes. Give me the brush." Mrs. Erlinford smiled graciously as her daughter complied, and stood watching his labors with an anxious eye. To hear the earl go back to the early days, by  calling her "Helen," was much; the,;compliment, from one totally unused to paying compliments, was far more. Already she saw an imaginary . coro- net shining on that graceful head. "Come, Mr. Clifford,' she said, moving to- ward the bookcase; "let me   do the houors, since those enthusiasts have quite forgotten us. You see, .we keep you ever in our minds;" and she pointed to a   set of volumes beautifulllv bound. They were his own  works; and he blushed like a girl on seeing them. "Helen's faorites, I assure you, Mr. Clif^ ford ;  and, I msay dd, my own." "Madarm; you do me far too great an honor," said the gratified author, with a,bow. "Not at-all-not at all l', replied the lady, with a  eore-sonding 'bend.-. - When are you goinig-to fvbr us with' another volume?" -     <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6470-00000022"/> ' That I cannot tell," he-said; with his eyes ixed on Helen, who was disputing one of Charlemount's proposed alterations. "It is an- idle time with me just noW. It is possible, however, that I may write another play for Regina when she returns." Charlemount started, on hearing that name; and Helen uttered. an exclamation of dismay. "Oh, look!"  "By Jove! I have done it now! You must have touched my elbow, Helen!"  '"Indeed, George, I was not near you! You made the blot yourself." *' What is it?" exclaimed Mrs. Eriinford, pressing forward. "A smudge-a daub 1" said the earl, peni- tently. "You see, I wanted Helen to put in the farmer, carrying, a pail of potatoes to the pigs." Clifford laughed. "A very unromantio subject for Miss Erlin- ford's pencil, my lord I I am inclined to feel glad that you have spoiled the picture." "How can you have the heart to say so? The farmer was an old friend of mine, and the pigs were perfect specimens. I wished to have him, at least, in the sketch, and now he if spoiled." ", May I look at the picture, my lord?" ", Certainly!"And the peer made room for him, and leaned upon his shoulder as he point- ed out the beauties of the sketch, in an anima- ted way. "You see, my dear fellow, I stopped at that very farm-house for three weeks, when I was traveling in New England. I was ihcog., of course; they used to call me ' Mr. George,' and never dreamed that I had any other name. I never enjoyed myself more in all my life. Do yop see that meadow behind the orchard trees?" ,* If by meadow you mean that dreary-look- ing wasee of sdow-yes." "Ah, it's not dreary in snmmer! Well, I helped the old man to make hay in August: it makes me wartn, now, to think of it. I believe he thoroughly frgavse me for the sin of being a' Britsher,' after that tremendous day's work." Clifford looked at him, and at the picture; with a certain curiosity. Well, what now?"   "My lord, I am delighted to hear this I A belted earl and a Yalrkee farmer tossing hay together in A sunny iel---it- is a scene well worth studying!" "But he did not know I was a belted earl 1" Zatd Cbarlemount, too obtuse to observe the vein of satire in Clifford's remark, th/ough Helen did 'so istantly. "He was a glorious old fellow! I am sorry I have spoiled him I It was all your fault, Helen!" ," Nay, that is most ungallant, my lordI Will you let me see if I can remedy your mis- take?" * What, do you paint?" " A little." "By Jove,. you authors seem to do every thing, now-a-days! Yes, try by all means I  wish you success P' * Thank you!" "You see it was Miss Erlinfordis fault, after all. She had dressed him in a smock-frock, with a true lover's knot embroidered on the shoulder. Now, an American farmer would hoot at any one in such a dress, I was trying tto alte it to the blue woolen garment John Humphreys used to wear-and behold!" Clifford could not help laughing at hiss de* spairing gesture. Hesat down, and took the brush from Charlemount's hand. Helen moved the palette nearer; he thanked her with a smile. The picture 'was well designed and copies with singular accuracy from the early written description, A range of snowy hills'eneircled a bleak, New-England valley: behind them rose, peak after peak, increasing in height and distance, and terminating finally ina dim vision of the farfamned White Mountains. In the val- ley wandered a' brook, flowing sluggishly undet icy fetters; a road followed its somewh t 'devious course, and through the bare branches of the trees a glimpse. was given of the roofs of a small village, and the steeple .of the "meetiDg-house."' The :farm-house itaslf lay off among the hills-a low, red building, t .-or- shadowed by some tall maple-trees, and fronted by the meadow, the orchard, and the "sugar wood"     .   .  With a few masterly' touches,Clifford reme- died the earl's blunder, and reduced the un- sightly blue blot to its proper form.   "there, my lord  Do you not recognize John Humphrey' again *"t ' The yery man! How in the world did you know the kind of frock he wore?" "I have been in New England myself;. and though I had not the pleasure of meeting him I know many of his kind." "Horn buttons and all!" exclaimed Charle mount, in rapture. "Now, Helen, all is plair sailing before you. You can finish as soon as you like, and I will go and find'a frame. It shall be of carved maple-that is an American wood, you know. When will it be done?" "Who lectured me last week for being im- patient?" said Helen archly. "I think you ian manage to survive another week without your beloved Mr. Humphreys. The canvass cannot be taken from the easel yet--the colors must dry."  "What a bore waiting is!"he said, pensively. "Don't you agree with me, Mrs. Erlinford?" "Undoubtedly, my lord! But in this ease I do not see how it can be helped. But I am sure  Helen will do her best."  ".Oh, yes! I have no doubt of that She is a good little girl, and does more to please me than I deserve. By the way, Helen, I promised i to bring you the manuscript of that old song."  "And have you kept your promise?" "To the letter!"And he produced a yellow sheet of paper from his pocket. "Lady Cath- g arie Erlinford - my grandmother, or great grandmother, I forget which-copied it with her  own hands, long, long ago. It was a favorite song of hers. ' Thereby hangs a tale,' I fancy." u Clifford looked at the delicate faded charac- ters with interest. ' "  Strange," he said, musingly, what a peeuo liar feeling it gives .one to look at such a rec- - ord as this! Lady Catherine- young and  tl fair--" "' beg your pardon, my dear fellow." cried  the matter-ot fact earl; " Lady Catharine was fI sixty five when she died."' "What of that, my lord? I take it for granted that she was young and fair once in n the course of her life." R ightl She was thetoastof three counties a and Charles Mohun and the Duke of  -   th erossed swords for her sake no less than four times. The women of our race were all beaa-   ze tiful-nay, they are " and he glanced at Helen and her mother with a smile. a  "It needs no words to tell us that, mylord," replied Clifford, whose eyes met Helen's at d that moment. She blushed deeply, and said: X ' You did not finish what you were saying of Lady Catharine." "4 True I Young and fairshe must have been, o judging by the descendants. But how little Ls she dreamed that those descendants would read  t the lines she Wrote, long, long after she had a turned to dust! It is a love-song, I see. I can fancy I hear her singing it now, and yet she is very silent in her tomb." "I have seen it," said Helen, playing idly r with the paper those dead fingers had once held. ' Here is her name at the end-Catharine- *only Catharine. Not a blot upon the,page- all fair and delicate to the last I Do you know, Miss Erlinford, it makes me sad to look upon. it. In presence of such memorials, that have outlived their day and generation, Ijbegin to wonder who will look upon the words I have written when TIam gone." - Helen listened earnestly; but Mrs. Erlinford  hated all thoughts of death, and broke in upon him with an affected laugh. '"My dear-Mr. Clifford, how gloomy you are trying to make us all! I do not like it I gives me the horrors 1" We are   all going to die some day, whether we like or not, my dear madam!" said Clifford dryly. ," Miss Erlinford, would it be aui unwarrantable piece- of presumption on my part, to ask you to sing this beautiful old song " '  "Nt at all!" said Helen, starting from a reverie, into which his unexpected words had thrown her. "Oh, by all means let us have the song l" \ cried Charlemount. ^' A hymn should 4lways follow the sermon. Eh, Clifford?" Clifford smiled, '"I will not inflictanother on, you for the next six months." "Oh! I did not mind' itl Of course you authors are privileged to 'talk shop 'now and then!"  . "I do not understand you, my lord." ' ,  ' "' Why; you knbw', unless you throw all    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6470-00000023"/> morality to the 'winds, you must preach up goodness, and all that sort of thing, in your books. English people prefer it-there 'is something ' respectable' in it-and so you go on making books that may ' lie with safety on the family table' (is not that the phrase?), until, at last, you get so into the habit of it, that'you cannot help 'talking good' as well I forgive you, my dear fellow." t"Your lordship is very kind," said Clifford, rather hotly. But a look from Helen made him keep back what he was going to add. i' Will you cotne and turn the leaves over for me?" she said, crossing the room to the piano- forte "I cannot ask Charlemount; he always forgets what he is about, and so spoils the ef- fect of my playing." Clifford followed. As he arranged the shtets before her,. she said, in a low voice, "Don't* mind what he says I He would laughat every thing of that kind--he always does I have bhd many a quarrel with him about it before, this!" "But you?" said Clifford, bending lower, and venturing to look .for an instant in her sweet blue eyes. They drooped beneath his, and 'a flush rose to her cheek. -"I believe that you were quite in earnest'!" she said, still lower, as she began to play the prelude. "It was a quaint old' ballad, English in its words, but full of that delicious simplicity which seems the gift of Scotch writers -alone. The air was plaintive, and something in the voice of the singer accorded well with words and music. Charlemount and Mr. Erlinford drew nearer, while Clifford stood still, silently, with folded arms and downcast eyes, yielding, with- out restraint, to the sweet melancholy that pos- Ceesed him. "Why, Helen, I never heard you sing half e * well before!" exclaimed Oharlemount, as she ceased. "You are turning into a regular nightingale on -our hands - is she not, Clif- ford?" "Yes. And what is more, she sings as if she had the nightingale's peculiar receipt for melody," said the young author. "' What is that?" "The bird warbles most sweetly when she ^.   rests against a thorn. Miss Erlinford's roses seems to have none. Yet whence the gift? i It is a peculiar one." "What in the world are you talking about, my dear fellow?" "A most simple thing. Sorrow always im- provesthe human voice; when the heart h,s suffered, the music, acquires a new and signifi- cant tone. It is singular that Miss Erlinfori t should have/discovered that secret. It must be a natural gift, for I am very sure pain 'has not taught it to her." Miss Erlinford started; but Charletount exclaimed: "Well, there I I never liked anything half so well in you before I Shake hands!"They did so, very gravely. "To think that another -man is capable of, crying over a little foolish I bit of music I I give you my word, Clifford, that when H hear ' Auld Lang Syne,' I 'am obliged to run into a corner and hide, for I al- , ways cry like a boy. My brother Alfred was fond of it, and we were all in all to each other once. i have sung it many a time with him at home, poor fellow!" Something very like a tear came into his eye as he spoke. Clifford pressed his hand; an 'Helen looked at him most kindly.- It wa' touching to see this one green spot in that worldly heart. Vain, and trifling, and wicked though he might be, he could not. quite forget the innocent early days, for the lost playmate  who shared them. Clifford was the first to break a silence that seemed binding three hearts together with new and pleasant ties. "We are not alone in ol:r weakness, my lord. I think mo0st men have had the same experi- ence at one time or another. I know an officer, one of the bravest fellows on earth. .He would lead his troop up to a masked battery, or head a forlorn hope without the least hesitation; but let him hear' Annie Laurie,' and he, would go into a corner, too, very speedily." "' Annie Laurie!' Ah, that is the Queen of Songs!"     H  "Yes: I would rather have, written it than 'Childe Harold.' And the sequel, if I may call it so, gives a new interest to it in my eyes!" ,' What was it, Mr. Clifford?" asked Helen. "While the brave young soldier was writing it, the lady was amusing herself in a different   way. The battle came and went-the soldier lay with a bullet in his- breast, and his quiet face turned up to the night sky. And where do you thihk 'Annie Laurie' was P" "Beside him!" suggested Oharlemount. "And dead as well!" added Helen. "Not she I She was alive and well, and, no doubt, happy, for she was a bride!" "Mr. Clifford, I am sure you are joking." I c No." "Then it is a libel, such as men delight to fix upon women." ",Bt if a woman told the tale?" i "Impossible!"  It was Regina!". Charlemount started, and looked incredu- lous. "She, of all others!" "I assure yotr she was quite vexed with me for venturing to disbelieve it for one moment. Being sure of that, she went on to draw con- * elusions infinitely provoking, because no one would expect them of' her. Other women have the privilege of being unromantic, and hard-hearted, at time, but we expect a Regina so have a little feeling, as well in private life as u the stage."            .  "She must have been laughing at you."  I "On the contrary, I never saw her more in earnest. Strange as it may seem, she has very little of the woman about her.' Zenobia is her true type-there is no softness in her  w character '                 t "But what did she say?" "She attacked all the old ballads, and the - old traditions as well."

She saw It, and actually laughed in my la face It would have been a happiness*to beat Charlemount was listening eagerly, "You describe a peculiar character." L"And a   peculiar woman, too, my lord. -If' Job had known Regina   -"-- He paused, and made an expressive gesture. "Is she so provoking, then ?"       a o             se   r "Provocation personified, my lord. The at most tantalizing of all human beings; and :e never, for two minutes, together, what you might reasonably expect her to be!" As he spoke, the image of Regina, in her own home, rose up before him-gay, arch, ea- D pricious, beautiful, and bewildering--pleasing his eyes, even when the mask pained his heart. He sighed, and smiled. "'She is a wonderful creature! Even while she vexes you, you cannot help feeling kindly toward her. She makes me think of a fairy changeling; there is something not quite hu. man about her, and one cannot judge her by, mere human laws. , But how we have wander- ed from  our subjectl We began with Lady Catharine, and we have ended with Regina! Miss Erlinford, you look pale; have we tired you?" "Oh, no!" She'leaned upon the piano, listening, but never looking up.  The light had gone from her face, the shadow was lying there, and the peculiar melancholy of which I have already spoken, lingered in her eyes. Turning away from Clifford's gaze, she looked over the song before her-one which she' had often sung of late-and caught the eye of Charlemount. "Sing that, Helen." "No--not to. day." "Nonsense! you know you like it. Come, we are going away; I am sure your mother thinks we are mad for staying so long." - "She will oblige you, I am sure," said Mrs. Erlinford.      . "Yes, mamma!" And the poor girl turned again to the in- strumentwith a   very obedient air. ,She had thought of Clifford, she knew not why, every time she sang those words, and it was hard to have him standing beside her as she uttered them now. Her voice faltered a' little over the last verse: "' There's a blue flower in my garden The bee loves more than all -  The bee and I, we love it both, Though It ia frail and smiall;  ; She loved it, too, long, long ago- Her love was less than mine; Still, we were friends, ad only friends, - : My sweetfriend, Leoline!' ' ' .A sweet little thing, isn't it, Clifford fn asked Charlemount.           ' ' ,     <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6470-00000024"/> "Very," replied the author, absently. The mention of the " blue flower in the gar. den" reminded him of Regina's favorite vio. lets, and he had little thought, at that moment, of any ." Leoline" but her.  Helen sighed, reading his heart by her own, as she watched him making his adieus to her mother and her- self. It needed no little bird to whisper in her ear that, if for a moment she had felt herself dear, she had beenemistaken, and that, how- ever uncertain he might be about his own feel- ings at times, Regina reigned paramount over him as yet. She digested that knowledge as best she might; and having said good morning. and good-bye with praiseworthy composure, went back as her visitors left the room, and busied herself in putting the last touches to her neglected picture.     The earl and-his friend walked from Mr. Er- linford's house into Hyde Park, arm-in-arm, but without exchanging a syllable. Clifford's thoughts were straying Brompton-ward- Charlemount was watching his face, and draw- ing conclusions from his silence. At last he "aid, abruptly: "Well, my dear fellow, am I in the way?". "In the way, my lord I Of what?" "The visit." "Where?" "To Regina." Clifford blushed, and smiled. "No." "How soon do you go?" "Perhaps in the course of half-an-hour. 'The luncheon hour is rather late-I shal have plenty of time before it." "That depends upon the nature of your in- terview. I strongly suspect luncheon will be' forgotten by both of you. But, since you are in no hurry, let us walk up toward the gardens. You can take a cab then." "I am at your service, my lord." They went down close to the water's edge. A few riders dotted the surface of Rotten Row -a few carriages loitered along the drive; but the Park seemed monopolized by nursery- maids and children, busy pedestrians taking a short out across to the Marble Arch, and rag- ged boys, who were tumbling on the grass, without the fear of stern park-keepers before their eyes. A regimental band was playing   "Ry's Wifer" at a distance, and the scarlet mass, marching and counter-marehing under the eyes of a mountede officer, had a pretty ef. feet, viewed' from the.. water-side. Charle. mount looked around with a glance of in- terest. "Is it not pleasant, Clifford.? Look at those cnildren under the. trees, on the other side. That ragamuffin standing on his head is, no doubt, far happier than either you or I just at present." "Who would think that it was the gay Earl of Charlemount who said this?" "You think I am talking nonsense?" "Yes." "I never can get credit for being sincere. But, my dear fellow, you have very little idea what it is to be Ear 1 of Charlemount." "How should I have?" -And Clifford's cheek flushed. "There you go. I intended no reflection; but you are like a p atent, match, and blaze up even with an accidental touch!"' "Well, go on with your confessions, my lord!" "* Mine will come in five words-I am sick of everything, "'Like the man in the' Rejected Addresses,' you have come to the conplusion that *r Thinking is but an idle waste of thought And naught is everything, and everything is' naught."' "Exactly I Blase is not the word-I had defined that before I was twenty. I am further gone now. Upon my word, Clifford, I am so unutterably bored by everything and every- body around me, that I come at times and, look into the Serpentine with very suspieious eyes. But now I suddenly bethink me ot something in connection. with you." "Indeed!" "I heard, when I had the pleasure of seeing you for the first time, that you are anxious to. secure a berth in the Tasmanian expedition." "Yesi" "I wonder if you would condescend to ac- cept it at my hands?" "You are extremely kind, my lord." "Then don't be offended. I have not the slightest wish to play the patron, I can assure you. But, because I write my name Charle- mount, I have some influence in those depart-   ments; and; in short, my dear Clifford, if you wish it, the appointment is yours." No spectacle on earth is so ludicrous as that of a true-born Briton conferring or receiving- a favor. The earl blurted out his liberal offer with a hang dog air, and Clifford heard it with a most defiant one; then both turned very red, and finally shook hands awkwardly. "* There, we will say no more about it," ex. claimed Charlemount. "Do you know that the expedition starts in August?" "So soon?" "Yes, you will have to weep all your tears, and vow all your vows; in a short space of time." "What if I neither weep nor vow?" "You will do both!" Clifford looked amazed. The earl laughed, and amused himself by pushing particles of sand into the water with his cane. "I'm sure I cannot see why you should be ashamed of it. It is not every man in London; who has the happiness of being loved by a Re- gina." "How do you know I, have that happiness, my lord?" asked Clifford, very stiffly. "When I know that you are with her day af- ter day for hours at a time, I can only come to that conclusion. If you crossed her in any c way, her gates would be closed upon you pret- ty speedily. They still remain open; there is i no tie of interest like that which binds her and the manager together; therefore, it is as plain e as that two and two m'ake four." uI do not agree with you." , "Of course, it is not your part to say so. But what are you going to do with her, if it is  not impertinent to ask such a question?'" Clifford hesitated a moment: then he red- 3ened to the temples as he said, with i painful effort: "I can only do one thingol4 lord, with Re- gina!" "And that?" "I shallmarry her." It was the earl's turn to color, and look an- ter otherway; but the next moment he grasped    Clifford's hand. Are you serious 2'; "Quite." 'In  that ease, pardon me if I seemed to per   ou speak of her rather lightly. But will you take a creature like that to Tasmania?" at  "If she 'will go." a  Do-you believe she will?"' er  "I amgoing to ask her." th  Ant turned toward the gate, he hailed a d, cab. "Listen for one moment, Clifford," said x. Charlemount, earnestly. - I did not dream of at this when I procured that 'appointment. Re- sign it, and I will get you something in Eng- land. You need not resign yourself, and Regina 9, also." f "You are very kind; I do not know how to thank you. Give me a little time to decide." "Three months-six, if you like." "Nay, they go in August. You shall have , my answer soon. But I must see her first, f You forget that I have not yet tried my fate.", "Come and tell me, if you succeed." "Where?" "At Charlemount House. I dine to-day at seven, and quite alone." "I will come." "Without fail?" "Depend upon me." "Well, success to you!" Clifford laughed gayly, and sprang into the cab. He did not greatly far the result, if the truth must be told. Charlemount watched-till it whirled around the corner. The cottage gate was opened to Clifford's eager ring by Prudence herself. -She smiled a welcome truly French in its cordiality when ishe saw him.             , "How very fortunate t The groom was just about to ride into town with, a note summon. ing you."  "Is any one ill?'. "Oh, no ; but we leave to-morrow." ' Leave I For what place?" i "That I cannot tell; somewhere, however, in la belle France: and we are to visit Paris by the end of next week." He brushed by her rather hastily, and en- tered the hall. It was filled with boxes; and Regina--half frowning, halfslaughing-was giv- ing orders to the ser rants and lecturing Ruth in thesame breath.         " "John; put the black trunk, the covered im. perial, and the two bonnet boxes together, and    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6470-00000025"/> carry the rest of this lumber away. My dear - Ruth, if you make such moans over the sim- plicity of our luggage, I declare I will set off with two small knapsacks, one of which shall be strapped on your shoulders." Ruth laughed; but seeing Clifford, retreat- ed. Regina, lookingup at the moment, put the pen with which'she was making a list of the luggage, between her lips, and held out' her hand. 1 How do you do? I hope you heard that querulous speech of mine?' "I did." "Take care that you profit by it." "It comes too late." "The general fate of good advice," she said, shrugging his shoulders. I condole with you. Ruth, come here. Mr. Clifford, let me intro- duce you to our young debutante of last even- ing-the Zephyr." Clifford bowed, and said something as com- plimentary as was possible under the circum- stances. Then, turning to Regina, he asked, anxiously;: "Wae Prudence right? She told me you were goin4g away to-morrow!" '( Prudence is always right, Mr. Clifford. We tart at-John, if you lift that imperial so care- lessly, you will break everything in my dress- ing-case. We utart at nine to morro* morn- ing: I was just thinking of sending for you." "To go with you?" "Oh, of course 'It is a habit of mine, you know. Dear Ruth I do look after John I He is carrying on the wrong trunk!" '  "Well, what did you want of me?" "It struck me that I should like to say 'good-bye ' to you," said Regina, without looking up from her list. "Thank you. Are you to be absent long?" "That is as the whim seizes us. . You must know that Ruth and I have sworn friendship   to each other, which is to last forever. Damon and Pythias were as nothing to us." "Indeed I I suppose it will end as all fe- male friendships do." "You, who know women so profoundly, tell us how that will be." "You will both fall in love with tne same man. One of you will give the other heo choice between the dagger and the bowl." "Mistaken there, for we both value the lords of the creation at their actual worth-which is so small that it cannot be perceived by the naked eye." "Well, then, Ruth will wear a prettier bon- net than you." '/ What a charming opinion you have of us! Well, if we manage to escape all these dan- gers, and come back together, we shall not ad- vise you of our return, I can assure you." "Why not?" "It would be your death 1" , You pay yourself a strange compliment." 4' Oh, I have nothing to do with itl IYou would have to own youself in the wrong; and your masculine vanity would get a blow which would quite put any pleasure you niight have felt at seeing me out of your head." "You compliment me now!" She laid down the pen, and gave the cpm. pleted list to Ruth. "(My fair future enemy, you will find all things set down in order there." Ruth laughed, and went up stairs to give the list to Prudence. Regina turned to Clifford. "Now, my dear sir, all cares are off my shoulders now, and I can be hospitable. It is nearly time for our dreadfully late luncheon. Shall we wait in the drawing-room or study till it comes?" "Let us go into the garden." "With all my heart." -   CHAPTER V. ' The garden has a fountain fair, And oft the lady watches there: Thus will her image come to me, Her'white hands lasped upon her knee . While the south wind is gently waving' The locks that o'er her forehead fall, r -  Or in the fountain's waters laving The rose trees by the fountain's wall. -M. B."   Regina took a straw hat from the stand be- side her, and whistling to Prince Charlie, bade Clifford follow her to the garden. "We will say farewell to my violets. I de- pend on you to look after them while I am away, if you are not too busy." He did not answer, but walked slowly on by her side, while she talked gayly of Ruth and herself, and the long, pleasant tour they had planned through the Continent. They stopped beside the fountain. The fresh green grass was springing np on every side. The young leaves were clothing the once bar- ren trees. The American violets starred the turf with their purple beauty, and the sun- shine of the spring was over all. A fan of earved ebony lay on the wide lip of the foun- tain-a' book: beside it. It was a miniature edition of Shelley. Clifford took it up, and looked a moment at the beautiful face of the portrait. ' "Ruthiand I spent the earlier part of the day here,' said Regina. "Ruth shares my home, my walks, my rides, my journeys." "Well!" "She will go abroad with me; we shall be together constantly, night: and day. Your. own good sense will show you that I may find more pleasure in this close companionship than in the somewhat ceremonious intercourse I hold withyou." Not mucn daunted, Clifford changed. his position, so that he could look exactly into her fae.4 4   I "Will you listen to me?" "Not ifoyou're going to talk nonsense, Mr. Clifford."  "Is it nonsense?" "Yes. Let us go back to the house."' "I shall do no such thing. Why are you so afraid to hear me, Regina?" "I'll tell you. Up to this time we have gone on very well. You have never said any- thing that I did not wish to hear--never made love to me-magde a fool of yourself, in short, in any way." "Thank you 1" ;"I know you are vexed, out that matters little just now. I do not want to hear from you what I might hear from a dozen London roues, if I ohose. I want to keep you as my friend." "And I want you, Regina, to let me speak for five moments, if you will be so kind." She sat down on the fountain's edge, and dipped the tips of her fingers into the water." "Since you persist, then, go on." He glanced around. The high wall. on one side, and the trees on the other, screened them from every eye. The curtains of the dining room and library were both drawn; no one could by any chance witness that interview without his knowledge. 'His 'eyes rested for one moment on Regina's grave face. Thien he suddenly exclaimed: "Good Heavens, Regina! do you want to drive me mad?" i No."           .-    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6470-00000026"/> "Then why do. you sit there so like a stone 9 Are you as heartless as the whole. world calls you?"  ' "Perhaps." He caught her hand in his. "You shall answer me!" "Release my hand, sir!" she said,-so im- ,eriously, that he dropped it at once. "We are not on the stage, I believe! We are not rehears- ing a tragedy. Be kind enough to say, in so many words, what you wish, and never fear that you will not get your answer-quite as soon and as. plainly as you will like!" she added, with a peculiar smilen He was looking at her iiuntter astonishment. "And this is Regina!" She smiled again. 4"I hope you like her!" This is the woman I believed-Ihoped-" "There, never mind the rest, my dear sir I It is evident that you have mistaken her from first to last, or you would never have come oi this errand It' "I must be dreaming!" "I shall find means to alaken you pres- ently. Come, are you going to utter the choice impertinences you have been preparing on your way from town thil morning?" "Impertinences, madam?" "Are your arrows sharpened so that they cannot fail to pierce my heart . You will aim akillfully, I am sure And I will tell you, for your comfort, that no one could 'wound me more fatally. Begin, then, as soon as you like!" "Are you mad, Regina?" "Not quite." "What have I said or done that you should speak to me in this way?" "Not much!" she answered, with a bitter laugh. "You have only shown me what an idiot I have been making of myself for the last wo or three months--that is all! A mere trifle I Don't let it interrupt what you were going to say!" ' Regina, do tell me what you mean?" "I believed that I might have a friend, even of your sex!" she said, sadly. "I took sue pleasure in the thought-- was so proud know that even I, in spite of the past, coul inspire and share a feeling so pure; anl now-   and now, Clifford, if you were not so dear to me, I should find it impossible to refrain from hating you! It may be impossible even yet!" "If this is my crime, I plead guilty," he said, looking at her with a smile. "And you have the heart to tell me so?" "I love you!' "Po on, pray-it is very pleasant." ' I will not say I would die for you-that ish but a cold promise; but I would live for you -with you."  "Ah, we have it then, at last!" she said. v I would give every moment of my exist- ence to you." "I am extremely obliged to you." "I would be home, country, and friends to you; you should have no joy that I did not bring, no sorrow that-I did not share." "Mr. Clifford, I always supposed that if I was fortunate enough to inspire a poet with a tender passion, he would pay me the compli- ment of saying something new, something startling, when he told his love; but you are going on in the old style-' die for me,' 'live for me, joys and sorrows,' etc., etc., etc. Why, [ have heard it over, and over, and over again .

No one can make them as she does; you will be quite as fond of them. as I alt. May I trouble you to give me your arm?"  It is the last straw which breaks the eamel's baek; and, although Clifford had kept his tenmper wonderfully well, all self-control van- ished at that mocking speech, and he raved up and down the garden like a madman. "Cruel! insulting! heartless!"These were the mildest epithets that came to his lips, as he recalled the tales of her treatment of those she lured on to love her, even as she had lured him. Through all the outhreak, she sat, placidly smiling to herself, and breaking the smooth surface of the water into a thousand rings and dimples by the drops she showered from her hand.   "Shall we go?" she asked, when he ceased The oyster patties-"  :  Clifford uttered an oath. "Y-es, I thought that would be the next hiog." "I beg your pardon, Regina, But you have bewildered me so completely that I do not know what - am saying." "I wish I could think so." Have you no mercy?" "None-when people offend like you 1" "Is it a sin, then, to love you?" "And to wish to die for me-or to live with me?" she continued, in a mocking tone. ", Oh, no, Mr. Clifford, the world would not call it so-at least, it would be a very venal one in its eyes. It is no sin to wound one, who had some little faith in you, to the very heart; no Bin to come here and insult me, as you would dare to insult no other; no sin, to make me feel all the old hate and wrath against human. ity at large stirring in my breast!"  "But do you not love me, Regina?" "Very much-just at present 1'9 she answer- ed, with a mocking smile. "Good Heavens! was there ever a woman like this?" "No, Clifford," she said, rising, and looking grave and sad; "let us hope nqJ. No other woman ever fell so low in eyes she loved as I have done to-day! Whose fault is it? What reason have I given you for this? Why have you come to 9ine who rejoiced to believe you  good and honorable--"  '  "Stop, Regina,"he said, hurriedly; " you  are under a dreadful mistake! I have not only  been telling you of my love for you-I meant -I intended-in short, I only ask you to share it in one way." "And that?"  "The most sacred I Be my wife, Regina!" "Your wife?"  "My own dear wife I I would have'said the te words before, if I had known your thoughts. fc But how could I dream that you had such un- n worthy ones of me "?  She looked at him very steadily. "Unworthy, were they? I am glad to hear r it! But answer me one question, on your  honor as a gentleman."          fe "I will."   1 . "Were those unworthy thoughts only on my side? Have you had none of me?', He hesitated.            , :t   Take time before you answer. There is a magnetism between those who love; and for a e day or two back-nay, up to/the moment (kf t your visit here this morningZ-I have felt that all was not as it should be between us." What could he say? Well, he knew that if  Regina was aware what suggestions his evil na- ture had made him in her regard, she would send him from her, though her own heart i broke in the sending. Deceit was necessary; for now that he was by her side, he felt that b he could not live without her. Better that truth and honor should leave him (hard though the parting might be) than Regina;  He looked up, and met her eyes unflinehingly. "Well?"               '  "I have been taking counsel with my mem- ory?" "What does it say?" "It acquits me fully. I have had no wrong thoughts of you. I have loved you, almost from the first, tenderly-passionately; but I have never thought of asking you to sacrifice yourself for me." "Oh, Clifford, do not deceive me! Better ,to part now, than when we are far dearer to each other" ' "I have told you the truth," "Then, forgive all my doubts; forgive all the provoking things I have said and done. I was grieved to the very soul that you had failed me. Even Ruth might have changed without my feeling it so deeply." "You love me, then?" "Is there need to ask the question?" "Only for the sake of the answer, which will be very sweet." 'Take it "And placing both her hands in" his, she looked up into his handsome face, with tears in hVr eyes. i I love you so dearly Clif- ford, that if you deceived me in any way, though my body might live many a year, my heart would die "               r The words were simple, but the look-the manner-how full of love apu faith they were I How much it seemed to him to win that eon.

"Trust me-give me all your faith and all your love I will not fail you!" "* God help me if you do!" she answered. I( stake everything upon this one last throw! - If I lose-if I lose!" "You will not lose!" he answered, believing in his heart of hearts that he spoke the truth. She released herself from his embrace, and sat down again on the fourpain's brim. "I can hardly believe that 1 am awake! It  seems like a dream of fairy-land!" "You must have dreamed for some time, then, for surely you knew that I loved you!" "Not like this!" They were both silent for a time. The folntain murmured in the sunshine-the birds sang as if their little hearts were bursting with joy-all was quiet and peaceful. It was like a new world-a second Garden of Eden, into which they had been born, an Adam and an Eve, who could never be driven out from their Paradise I Clifford gazed at Regina with a new pleasure. The instinct of ownership was strong within him. It was no longer the beau- tiful actress-the darling of the stage-who sat before him ; but his own darling-the wife . of his bosom, perhaps the mother of his chil- dren I Queen of all other hearts, she was yet his subject-his slave, if he so willed it I 8he had kept him from his triumph long, but the day was coming when she would love her chains, and kiss the hand that riveted them I It would be his turn to command, and hers to obey-his to be pleased, and hers to please- hers to love, and his to reward that love with tenderness and protection! It was strange that his musings should take this hue so soon -it only showed how much her unconquered freedom had vexed him, though he knew it not! He had feared the tigress yet untamed. He thought, with blissful selt-eomplacency, now that the sharp claws were pared, and the savage nature subdued, how pleasant ah em- ployment it would be to' teach his charge to know her master's voice, and crouch lovingly at her master's feet  I suppose what I have just said will make some difference in your plans for to morrow?" he remarked, at last.   "Do you? I believe not!" she answered dreamily, without looking up. "Surely, my love, you do not intend to start off now on a journey that seems (I beg your pardon if I offend) exceedingly like what people call a ' wild goose chase,' without me to pro- teet and care for you?P" ," Protect me? Care for me?" she repeated, lifting her eyes with a puzzled look.. Why, Clifford, do you imagine I have grown sud- denly helpless . I traveled through America and over the Continent entirely alone! Ruth will be with me now."  * Your position is changed," ventured Clif ford. "Ah!" There was very much in that little mono- syllable-the first warning of the cloudy wea- ther about-to obscure the bright horizon ere long. "Are you afraid to trust me?" she asked, with a glance that made him urn crimson. "You are ungenerous, Regina!" "Answer the question!" 'I am not!" She mused a moment, and then made room for him beside her. "Sit down for a little time, my dear friend. The lunoheoinbell has just rung, but we will not mind that!"  Clifford smiled. "Charlemount prophesied that lunch would be ignored."  ". Who'?" "Charlemount-the earl.. Surely you know him!" "Is heone of your friends?" "Yes." "You have been with him to,;day?' "All the morning. We were at Mr. Erlin ford's together:" "Indeed!" Regina set her lips very firmly together, and looked into the fountain. She was jealoius of Helen Erlinford; till that moment- she bad' never known it. But far too proud to betray this secret to her lover, she carefully avoided all mention of her name. "And after you had left the house?" "Oh I we walked up into Hyde Patr and the Gardens," exclaimed Clifford, to whom a visior s   of the blonde Helen, at her easel, had suddenl and unaccountably risen. ":And what did he say about my luncheon?" "That, we should be absent-that was all." He turned uneasily from her, dreading the cross-examination which he felt sure would fol- low ; and wishing in his heart that he had held his tongue in one instance-possibly in both. "Did he know your errand here?" "Yes, love," replied poor Clifford, as meekly as if he had been three years married. Regina's eyes sparkled with scorn and anger. "I thought as much!" "But I see no harm in it, Regina." "' Nor I." "Yet you are offended. "I suppose you will think -it necessery to proclain -from the Monument that you are about to marry me, before the ceremony takes place."'  "My dear Regina, I have never mentioned it except to him." "Of all men in the world, the last one who should have known it." "Why." "You must see the indelicacy of the thing as well as I. He is Erlinford's brother." "If he and I can forget that, surelyS you may."  "That is not all. If you promise never to I act upon what I tell you, I will go on." "I promise."  "Upon your honor?" "Upon my honor." "Not many weeks ago, the Earl of Charle- mount wrote to me;" "Wrote to you? For what, pray?" "Nothing of any consequence," she answered. s Rith a smile. "H He merely said that' he found y Erlinford Park rather lonely; that the rose- garden there was considered very beautiful; a and that if I felt inclined to visit it in his com- r pany--" . "Regina!" "A carriage should be at my disposal, toge if ther with an unlimited amount of, diamonds, and blank checks upon Coutts &amp; Co., signed by' his name." "The infernal villain!" eried Clifford, start.- ing from his seat. H And when I told him to- day that I was about to ask you to become my   ly wife, he apologized for-seeming to speak light- ly of you. What have you done with that let- P" ter?"  "  "I tore it into fragments, and commissioned Pe Prudence to'inform his lordship of its fate." l-  "Did she?"  d  "He has neveri called. I suppose he has read my silence rightly." "Why did you not tell me of this before?" y  "What reason had'I for doing so " - s  "At least, you knew I was your friend." ' Possibly ; but if I told my friends of all the insulting offers I receive, and requested them to punish the authors, I should be unbearable." He looked at her reproachfully. "Dring all this time of pleasant compan- ionship, 1 have fancied I was reading ybu thor- oughly. I find my mistake. IJ have never turned the first page of the mysterious book." "What would you have, my dear?" she answered, with a conscious smile. "When a gentleman introduces himself to me with the assurance that I need not expeet him to make love-"  "You will never   forget that unlucky speech." "I do not intend to. But there are nine women in me, Clifford, and I am only to be thoroughly known when I am  thoroughly loved." "When will you marry me?" he asked, ab. ruptly.                '  "Not yet." Why not?" "We have many things to speak of first." Let us begin with them at once."' "With one, we will, for it grows out of this subject. You will see that you must give up your friendship with the noble Earl." , "Do not speak of him, Regina. I wish with all my heart I had given you no promise. I would not have done so had I dreamed what you were about to say." "I would not have told you without it. But if you should meet-" ' There is no fear of it."  "'You both frequent-the same places." "Well, I will avoid them--or hiim; The matter is soon settled."  "I am afraid not." , ' Then we will go abroad for a time. He    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6470-00000028"/> has procured me an appointment in the Tas- manian expedition, confound him!" "When did he do this?" "Not long ago." "Before you told him of me?"' "Of courde." "Then, my dear Clifford, you maybe sure it was out of no friendship for you." Wh What object could he possibly have had?" "*He might have wished you away. All London knows that you and I have been on terms of great intimacy." * By Heavens, Regina, you must be right! He withdrew at the moment I spoke of you, and promised to procure something in England for me." I "No doubt. He did not wish me to go to Tasmania." "Oh I what an idiot I have been. I have been as frank with that man as a boy of sixteen might been I I even promised to dine with him to-day, and to let him know-" Unhappy Clifford I His "frankness" had brought him into a fresh scrape; for, though he checked himself, as he fancied, in time, Re- gina guessed the truth with all a woman's quickness. "Upon my word, Mr. Clifford, I am charmed with you. So you were going to dine at Char- lemount Iouse, and repeat this conversation over your wine and walnuts. I feel a strong inclination to box, your ears, sir!"And her glance, certainly, did not belie her words. "You may, my darling. I am sure I de. serve it for not having held my tongue in proper time and place," he answered, so very penitently, that the white hand, uplifted threat- eningly, condescended to linger for a moment upon the bright curls waving over his fore- head. He paid it homage ere it dropped again. That first oaress of Regina's-it was years before he entirely forgot the thrill of per- flct joy it brought to him. "* You are not to tell the earl of that!" she aid, with a roguish smile. "Of course, you will resign your Tasmanian appointment." At once." "But you spoke of going abroad. Are you really ready to sacrifice England and all your Euglish friends, for me?" "More than ready."   You will repent one day." , Wait till it comes." "But listen, Clifford, and let my hand alone We cati never live in London." "Why not?" "What kind of a part should I play here a Mrs. Clifford As Regina, the actress, I a) in my natural/plaed-a kind of brilliant outcast for whom no one is obliged to take thought-- species of social comet, at which people star. admiringly, but whose close approach would b rather alarming." '. You exaggerate your position. f "Not At all. But when I become Mrs. Clif ford, the grandeur of the tragedy ends, and the beginning of the comedy-a low comedy. mind you-begins." I confess I do pot see it." , "You would still keep your place in society. People would be more curious than ever to see you; young ladies would beg your autograph, and publishers would run your poems up to fourth and fifth editions with miraculous speed. Meanwhile, I should be sitting at home, mend. ing your stockings and sewing up the rents in your-gloves; solacing myself with the thought that, in all human probability, nine women out of every ten were making quiet love to you, or you to them, as the case might be. Oh I it is a ravishing idea!" He could not help laughing at the sirug of her shoulders and the peculiar expression o- her face. "But if you went into society with me?" She pointed to Lord Erlinford's ring, an) looked at him silently. It was enough; they spoke no more of a home in London. "Where shall we live, then?" "In my Texan villa, if you like." "You forget that I am a poor author!" "Bah t let us not talk of money; I bate the name. If I share your name, you must share my home!" "Ah, that name!" he said, suddenly.- How little you imagine its history!" "Has it one?" "Yes." "Tell it." "It is only mine by courtesy-not by right. "How can that be? Did not your father bear it?"    He looked at her very sadly. "You may remember that I once said some thing to you about my peculiar position. I told you then that I was a nameless man." "I have not forgotten!" she answered. "But I did. not tell you this-that I have not the slightest idea who my parents were. I was placed at a northern school, before my third year, and educated there under the name of Clifford. On my eighteenth birthday I was dismissed bygthe master, with a bank-note of 100-those being, as he said, all the instruc- tions he had received concerning re. I came to London like a stray dog, and have made it my head-quarters since., But I am as ignorant at this day of my right to bear my name as Iwas then." Regina smiled. "Never mind; it is a pretty one--' Regina Clifford." She took out her note-book, borrowed his pencil-case, and wrote it upon the fly-leaf. The faint traces of the lead outlasted all the vows they uttered-if not all the love they felt -and stared her in the face, years after, like an accusing and avenging ghost. "You do not love me the less for this mis  fortune?" he said, inexpressibly relieved at her c her quiet manner. "Foolish boy, I love you and not your name. Nothing will ever make me love you less-save one!" she added, after a slight pause.  a "And that?" "Doubt me, or give me apsu to doubt you, at your peril," * How can I do either." "Are you sure?" she asked, taking both his. hands in, hers, and hiding her face uponhis a breast. *"Knowing what my past has been, ei can you trust me for the future?" "Implicitly." "Remember that pronrie.  Nothing ,   tan ever part us but your breaking it. When you f rusult me by a suspicion, though only in m; thought, I shall kow it and shall leave ou at once.'"     ..

I will make tea' for you, this 'evening; as domestically as if I were already Mrs. C.'; and you need not leave us till the small hours chime." ' She ran up the garden-walk.

Another, and an- other, and another succeeded it, and still she lingered-still she begged his pardon for the delay, but said, frankly, that since life had so few seasons of perfect happiness, it was a pity to cut even one' of them short. She was charmed with the careless, roving sort of existence on which. they had entered: charmed with the company of artists, male and female, unto which they had joined themselves; charmed with Lake Leman, with Venice, with Rome, with the Alps,and with the ruins of Pompeii; charm. ed, in short, with everything and everybody; and so deeply, that home, with all its attractions, could not draw her toward England, just then. Clifford sulked, or stormed,'as the ease might be, over every letter that reached him. One day, they had ascended Mont Blanc in an absurd, hel- ter-skelter style, which she illustrated by a com- ical little pencil sketch; on another, they were just starting on a pilgrimage to a famous shrine, to be performed much in the style of the "Dodd Family Abroad"; on a third, they had had an adventure with the banditti; on a fourth,' they ware about to explore the catacombs in the Eternal City, and attend vespers at St. Peter's; and so the list went on, proving more and more plainly to the exacting lover, that however dear he might be to her, she could yet commit the heinous sin of enjoying herself thoroughly, even though he was separated from her by many miles of land and sea. It touched his pride that this should be so. He often anathematized her as heartless and unfeminine;. when the sim- ple truth was, that she was a far truer type of womanhood, as it ought to be, than he had ever uet before. The fourth month of Regina's absence was drawing to a close, when an early post brought to Clifford the following letter  "DBABIaST: I am very penitent, I assure you; and, catching sight ofthe clifftof England, have hardly cour- age to ask you to welcome me home again. But I have been'so happy, Clifford, and you must pardon me. "We have'said good-bye, at last, to all our pleasant friends.

Home again   That night he should meet her  His first thought was one of unmixed plea-. sure. Then he read the letter a second time, and began to find fault with it " Her good Clifford,' her 'dear Clifford ' Yes, because, like a fool, I have stayed in this hot city, while she has been wandering, heaven knows where, with a troop of'vagrant artists. I was useful-I was well employed; and so she condescends to throw me a sugar-plum for the services I have rendered.

Confound it, what an insufferable ass 1 have been 1" He stuffed the letter into the fire, with this candid reflection, and held it down with the poker till it was utterly consumed. Looking up, after this exhibition of resentment, he caught the arch, smiling glance of a portrait which he had painted from  memory, and in- stalled in the place of honor over his mantel- piece. The darl gray eyes were all alive with \ glee; the red lips, half parted, disclosing the' line of pearls they hid; the graceful head, turning over the shoulder, seemed to nod a gay defiance of his wrath. Regina - beautiful, willful, and provoking--glanced down upon her subject and her slave An odd thrill, half. pain, half pleasure, pierced his heart; he sprang up and gazed long into those 'pictured eyes, that laughed from their bewildering depths over his perplexity,  "Ah!" he said, at ast, " we will change that fook "  And he' caught up his brush, placed   the picture upon a little easel which stood in one corner of the room, and set himself to work. It was late in the afternoon before he finished. He stepped back from the easel, and started guiltily at the result of his labor, The beauti- ful face still glanced at him over the white shoulder-,-but the smile was gone; the bloom and light had vanished; the cheeks were pale; the parted lips seemed quivering with agony; and the eyes, turn which he would, they fol- lowed him with the accusing glance of passion- ate regret and misery. "The dancing shape and image gay," which he had first depicted, though life-like enough, was not to be compared to this, from which all gayety had fled. Some- tling stronger than himself had been at work   'during those silent hours; the spirit of evil had entered' into heart and brain, and had guided hand and pencil, till it shuddered at their terrible success. Could it be, that in his anger he had desired, or determined, to darken Regina's life till she grew like this? I cannot tell; but something in those mournful eyes was too painful for him to bear. ie tu ned away-then ainme back suddenly, and drew his brush over face and form alike. In place ot Regina was, a blurred. stretch of canvas. He looked at it in silence-then sighed deeply; and, pushing the easel into its dark corner, flung palette and brushes after it, and moodily began his toilet, preparatory to his departure for the cottage.    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6470-00000030"/> CHAPTER VI.. The blossoms of the rose may flower, But m nths are 'twixt its buds and me  I may forget this anguished hour- Ay, e'en forget thy treachery; Yet, can it be?-this saddest parting Veils my whole spirit like a pall; And in my eyes the tears are starting- Thee losing, I am I sing all!  --M. B.   At exactly seven o'clock, Clifford .dismissed  his cab, and rang at the gate. Fresh wheel- marks in the lane, and a collection of boxes and wicker-cases on the lawn, informed him of Regiua's arrival, even before the beaming Prudence had time to speak. "When did they come?" he asked. "An hour ago; and the dear creature has been in a fever of impatience ever since to see you." ' Where ie she t' 1 believe at the stables," said Prudence, as she tripped off toward the house before him. "If you can but find your way through into the study, I willy go and tell her," said Pru- dence, throwing the hall-door wide open. He looked in-another collection of luggage was strewed over the stone ffior. Ruth, on her knees before a huge wicker basket, seemed doing homage to some mysterious idol in its shrine. She started up, and came to meet bimn. The hand she held out was slightly browned, round her pale cheeks had won from the southern sun a color like that on the heart of a delicate wild rose. She looked far hap- pier, too, and greeted him almost as gayly and frankly as Regina might have done. "Well, truant," he said, looking down at her with a somewhat admiring glance--" what sort of greeting do you fancy I shall give?" "Ah, we have been to blame; but we are going to stay quietly in England now, and you must forgive us. Has Regina made her peace with you?" /   I I have not seen her." "Not  Let me go for her." * No," he said, detaining her, as she would have passed. "When Saladin and all the rest of the pets have been caressed to their hearts' content, perhaps my turn will come. Regina, you kndw, believes that the claims of her four- footed friends are infinitely superior to any those may put forward who have the misfortune to go about on two." In spite of the gayety of his tone, Ruth read his annoyance with a woman's wit.  "Regina waited till now," she said. "One long hour she has been here; yet she shut her; self resolutely into. her study, though Saladln was neighing and stampinsg in his stable; and Prince Charhe was barking himself hoarse in the drawing room, because she would not go to them. You should have come earlier." "Do not think I blame her," said Clifford, a little soothed by this new version of the tale. "It is only natural, after all." A light foot came flying up the garden path, and up the hall behind him; a sweet, eagei voice cried out: "Oh, Clifford! C'ifford!" and, before he could turn around, Ruth vanished like a spirit, and two white arms were around his neck, two warm' lips touching his in a way that made him forget all pride, and jealousy, and anger, as if they never had been. He had got his darling back again, aniwith that heart beating so against that encircling arm, and that voice murmuring such fond, pet names in his ear, he   was happy, blest, and cared for nothing else besides on earth        '  "Let me look at Macheth's witch," he said, playfully. when the fiArt joy of the meeting was over. "Show rme what you have been doing to yourself." And he held her off at arm's length, as if she had been a ehila. Certainly, no face was ever less liko the Up- braiding picture he had blotted Out of exist- ence. 'Brown, indeed, she was'; but the healthy hue of the cheeks contrasted so charmingly with the white forehead and the swan-like throat, that he could not find it in his heart to quar!re with the change. The gloomy, scorn- ful look had quite vanished frbm het eyees-she was breaking into smiles, during his scrutiny, like a happy child; and when .he released her at last, she danced around him to the music of her own sweet laughter, and then made an ab- surd little courtesy, and an equally absurd mil- itary salute. ' Are you pleased with me?" she asked. "Pleased i Oh, how could you have the heart to stay away so long, Regina? If you only knew how I have longed for you!1* "You really missed me, then?" "Missed you! I am worn to a shadow ". "Indeed! A very substantial one 1" "But how could you- "'Oh, poor Robinson Crusoe- Oh. how could you do .o? If it had not been for his gun, He would have been undone."' She sang, in a gay little voice that made him laugh, in spite of himself.' It was, in fact,.im-. possible to be provoked with her, however tan- talizing she might be. With two words-with one look-she had made him forget all his vexa- tion of the past three months; and she was for- given even before she had asked forgiveness. She looked at him with fond eyes. "I am glad to get home," was the finale of her song. And I am glad to have you here, Regina. If your heart had not been harder than the  hither millstone, you would have come to hear me say it long ago.' . .

"Where!"' "He was in Paris. We met him driving in the Bois de Bolognae," "What on earth did he want in Paris?" "Warm  weather, possibly l" said Regina laughing. "If so, he found it.

"Strange that he should be there?"' said Clifford, looking at her steadily. "I agree with you.

"Yu actually prefer me, a poor author, a man without a name, to an earl." "I do. strange as it may seem." He tried to draw her nearer, but she escaped from his grasp like a stray sunbeam. "My dear Clifford, wd must not stand 'here billing and cooing thus all the evening. Unro- mantic as the confession may sound, I want my tea. Will you come? But stop; let me first show you what Ruth has brought home. You will not betray me-it is a secret!" "I will keep it most faithfully." "Then take one peep; but be quick about it, for I just heard the door open up stairs!" She lifted the cover, and gave him a glimpse of a glistening robe of snowy satin, and a veil seemingly wrought by the hands of fairies, so exquisite was the texture. "What in the world is it-a satin-gown?" "A gown  One would think you were talk- mg of a workhouse uniform. That is Ruth's bridal robe!" ," Ts she going to be married.?"

"That I cannot tell." What-have the female Damon and Pyth- ias any secrets from each other?" "There are a number of things we say little shout, and this is one. I simply know that she loved him long ago, and that he was not very constant. But now he has returned to her. They met in Paris-they have written often to each other, and he is to follow us to England, and claim his bride very soon. Dear Ruth, I am glad she is going to be happy with him at last." "And so am I Since I am going to be so happy myself, I am quite willing that other people should enjoy themselves, if they can" "What 0ahilanthropist you are!" "Where is Regina?" said Ruth's voice at this moment, on the stairs. Down went the lid of the wiekA case, and,   while Clifford still stood staring about him, Re- gina had darted like a spirit to the study door, and put her head out ,from it, with the most innocent air imaginable. "Here, Ruth, what have you done with Mr. Clifford?"  Ruth cast suspicious glances at him, as e stood blushing beside the mysterious basket. "He is in the hall, Regina!" "Dear me I Pray come into the study, Mr. Clifford; tea is quite ready i" said Regina, with grave courtesy, as she motioned him past her. to the table. Half-bewildered and half-pro- voked, he gave her a look that nearly scattered her composure to the winds, and took his seat at her right hand, opposite Ruth, who was wondering silently if his curiosity had led him to lift the cover that hid her idolized dress from the profane gaze of all unprivileged eyes. The meal was a very gay one; for Prince Charlie lifted his white head on one side of Re- gina's chair, while the gray cat balanced itself on the arm of the other, and rubbed its head, now and then, caressingly against her shoulder. Peter, who had croaked and grumbled unmer- cifully at Clifford, during those many monthe, now deigned to accept a bit of sugar from his hand; and the canaries, beating up against the glass windows of their home, sang. songs of welcome, because Regina was there once more. It was impossible, with' all this outhurst of joy on the part of her pets, not to sympathize with her in her pleasure; while Clifford' found him. self patting Saladin's arched neck, when he wad led up to the window after tea, without one particle of envy though the favorite had robbed him of Regina's first kiss-Regina's first glad welcome I He told her as much, when Rut h strayed away from them for a few moments, tc dream of her absent lover, as she loitered up and down the lane. "Were you jealous of poor Saladin?" she asked, with a quizzical look. "Very  and of the dog, and the eat-o, everything you love, in short." "Well, it matters little-but take good care not to go farther!" "How?" "Never grow jealous of a human beiqg 1" "I think you will never give me cause."   Ah I you believe it at last!" she said, with a beautiful smile. And, hand in hand, they went dancing down toward the fountain, to watch the sunset. For the last time I But they knew it not!  We never know when that momentous last has come-else, how should we linger over our parting words-.- how much more fondly, sadly, would we look into the eyes that will never meet' our own, with the old, loving glance, again! There is nothing on earth so sad as this unconscious farewell to what we have prized so deeplyl No after-parting can be half so bitter-no af- ter-sorrow remembered with a pang half so keen!, The sun sets-we are together, happy and beloved! The sun rises-and a gulf lies between us, over Wyhich the one may not, and the other will not, pass. Perhaps our "Good' night!" was but a careless tone-and, now we shall say "Good night " no more. Perhaps our hands met but for a moment-and now they will never meet again! Perhaps-for this, alas! is very possible-we uttered some half-pettish word at the very last, secure 'in the thought that the kindness of the morrow would atone-and that morrow is never going o dawn! Perhaps we went still further-it may be, that our last word was a taunt-our last look, a cold, sarcastic 'one! We shot a poisoned arrow-we fully intended to draw it out ere .long--but the time for such surgery. has gone by, and it must rankle in our own breast, to the end of life, even as it rankles in that other I "All over!" "Too late!" "Lost and gone:!" What bitter words are those, and yet, how constantly some sad heart is saying them, in the unbearable solitude it has made for itself. If it be hard to watch the grave closing over a beloved form, there is yet peace and comfort in the thought that the cold heart loved us to the last-that the dying eyes looked at us, but a moment before they opened on. another world than this-and looked with ten- derness, which not even that dread hour could quench. All is over there I But we feelthat: "  On that unknown and silent shore, S ure we' shall meet ad heretofore, Some summer morning!"' and that "summer morning" 'not, perhaps, se- faraway. But these unfihishd parting s-these sudden, unforeseen leave takings-which, be cause they were so utterly unforeseen, could o    scarcely be called leave takings at all-these buryings of the dead, who are only dead to us, but living to all others-it is these that are hardest to bear-these that wound the heart so deeply, that when its last faint pulse ebbs and dies away, it is bleeding still I Well was it for that luckless pair that they dreamed so little of the misery a few short hours had the power to bring. Ruth; walking up and down the lane, and looking at the purple evening sky, was equally oblivious to the possibility of sorrow. More loving by nature than Regina-though perhaps  less passionate-her whole soul was filled with dreams of that absent one, who, after a long estrangement, had returned to her in such a generous and noble way. Not of his rank and wealth was she thinking so fondly--not of the station' she would occupy as his wife-but ot the love, the truth, the honor, she had so en tirely doubted; and in whose existence it was so sweet to believe once more I Hark I the quick tread of a horse's hoofs- a horse that lifts its' feet in no vulgar way-. that arches its 'head, and moves daintily, though swiftly, onward, with that peculiar haughty grace seen only in a proud steed, or a proud and beautiful woman. It is not the car- rier's clumsy animal-it is not the "brewer's horse," stationed at the Swan-far less is the rider in any way akin to John Hodges or burly Ralph Smith. Tall, handsome, and stately, he sits erect in his saddle, with his eyes turned to. ward Regina's cottage: one would fancy that keen glance had power to pierce through the very garden walls., Ruth utters a little cry ot joy, and clasps her..hands ovr her heart; he turns and smiles on seeing her; and then she flies to 'meet him, disregarding the pancing hoofs of the bonny bay, but seizing his hand before he had time to dismount, and pressing it fondly to her lips. "O George, dearest George, how good ot you! When did you come? I thought you were still in Paris 1" "I left Patis, and came to England in, the very next steamer," 'was 'the quick reply. "But I want'to talk to you, Ruth; are you alone here?"  "Quite. re' i R   i  ' "And where in Regina? Will she be dart-    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6470-00000032"/> ing out to call you in five minutes' time?" "Ah, no I she is with Clifford." "The deuce she is!" exclaimed be, scowling at the garden wall, as Ruth patted the neck of his hosre. "How long has he been here?" "An hour, I think." "Stand aside, one moment, Ruth; I wish to Nismount" . She obeyed, and the Earl of Charlemount (for it was no less a personage) sprang to the ground, and throwing the bridle of his horse over one arm, offered her the other. "Come; we will walk up the lane.   I thougjt I might meet you here, and so came without a groom." "Dear George!" The affectionate tone, and the gentle pres- sure of the litle hand upon his arm, seemed to remind the earl of a forgotten duty., He bent over her with a smile. "We are quite alone, Ruth, and you have not given me a greeting yet." Her lips touched his lightly. How different was the modest caress of a woman soon to be his wife, from that of the girl who had given up all for him not two years before, without a hope of restitution on his part. He felt'it, and his conscience smote him inwardly. * Good little Ruth!" he said, aloud; "you deserve a better lover than I have ever been." -' And where could I find one?" I am afraid you would not have to look long or far. But are you so very fond of me?" "It is late to-ask that question?" "I know it. But, if, by any chance, Ruth, you should find me to be a villain-not as I' was before, for that, unfortunately, is a com- mon case-but a villain, for whose villainy no excuse could possibly be found-what would you say then?" "I do not fear it!" "But if it could be so-what would you do?" She fixed her large eyes upon him, solemnly. "Die!" He started, and turned pale. The next mo- ment he recovered his composure. "Ah, Ruth, that is more easily; said than done I I don't know that! you would die, but I think you would hate me-that your bit- terest curse would follow me through my whole ifel"   "No!" she iaid, firmly. "I ean never have curses for you, George I Nothing but love-- and, perhaps, prayers," *Strange creatires you women are!" was the musing reply. "Yet you are not all alike. There is Regina, for instance; she would send anything but prayers after the man whb be- trayed her." "Clifford will be true!" said Ruth, in a low voice. "Are you sure?" "He idolizes her. And their wedding-day comes very soon."  "There is many a slip 'tween the cup and the lip, Ruth. However, I will prophesy no evil. If Clifford wins her, I hope he wil be true to her." "And you, George?" "I!' said the earl, looking down into the earnest, upturned face. "I shall be true as steel to the lady of my love!" "Ruth gave a little, contented smile "But, my dear child, what do you think I came here this evening for?" "To seenme!" "Very true. But I also came to ask you to do something for me." "Name it.' "Promise first that you will consent." "You know well that I can refuse you no thing." "Well, then, come farther up the lane, anD speak-very low. You know it was your wish that our wedding-day should be the same as Regina's?" "Yes." "And that we should be married in the same church, by the same clergyman?". "Yes."            f "You were so happy in the thought that i had not the heart to tell you while we were in Paris that it could not be." "Why not, George?" "How pale you look, and how you cling t my arm I You little goose, you cannot think mean to put off the marriage entirely!" "I did not know," said poor Ruth, who had felt giddy and miserable enough till these words fell upon heirear. "Itstartled me at first; but if you call me a goose, I know you love mn4 still. So, go on l"   Charlemount laughed. "Upon my word, that is an original iab., Ruth. But what I wish to say about our mar- riage is this: it must be private." "Very well." "Strictly private, Ruth! No human being -not even Regina-must know whom you, have married till I give you leave to speak." "Is this necessary?" asked Ruth, sadly. "If it were not necessary, I would not ask it." "But may I not tell Regina that I am mar- ied?" "If you like. -But not that you are Count. ess of Charlemount." "Oh, I care little for that," she answered, lightly. "I was only thihking of being your wife, George!" He turned his head away. "By Heaven I it is like seething the kid in its mother's milk!" he said, inwardly, ith a cruel pang of re- morse and shame; yet he persisted in his pur- pose. "That is not all: our marriage must be im- mediate!" "Before Regina's?" "Conlound Regina!" he exclaimed, impa- tiently. Then, seeing her astonished look, he passed his hand hurriedly over his forehead, and addded: "Forgive me, Ruth; the simple fact is, that I am worried to death, and I eannot choose my words." "Dear George, I. will not tease you. Is this business of the marriage worrying you?' "Yes:  "Tell me; then, what to do. I will obey  without a word." "Will you leave London?"        X "Alone?" she asked, anxiously.  "Of course." Her face brightened, "Yes; if you wish it. Where am I to go?" He took her hand in his, and bent down and issed her.     - "Ruth, you are an angel-and H-b-ut no matter about me. Listen t If this marriage r does not take place speedily, and privately, t we may have a long delay, and that I will not g bear.; You must go away at onee, to Wilver- ton, i' --shire. I have made :all arrange- ' meats there; and Howe, who is. my confiden- d   tial sevant, will go with you, and stay there with you, till I come, As soon ase the settle- ments are made, I will join you-we will be married privately, by a bollege friend ofmiine, who has tken orders-and start fou the Con- tinent, at once. My lawyer and the clergyman will keep the secret-so will Howe; and When  we return, in the course of four or five years, no one will recognize the-Zephyr in the Count. ess of Charlemouut; and you can take your place in society without the least trouble. - Do you consent to this arrangement?" "I consent to anything you think best, George. When am I to go?" "To-morrow. The early post will bring you a letter; and you must tell Regina you have heard of my illness, or anything you like, as an excuse for your sudden departure." "I cannot do that. Regina and I have secrets of our own, it is true, but we never say thething that is not to each other. I will not tell her the reason for my going-.it will not be for long. I suppose I shall see her again before we go abroad?"' "Oh. certainly! Well, manage everything n your way. You will find a little cottage at Wilverten, Ruth-I think you will like it- and you are to remember that it, and its grounds and furniture, are my first gift to you. My lawyer has the deeds, and HoWe has been backward and forward, all the while we were in Paris, getting it ready for you."  "Dear George, how good you are to me!" What made that red flush mount to Chsrle- mount's brow as he heard her fond acknowl- edgment of his care for her comfort? Just then, another horse and rider appeared at the head of thelane, coming rapidly toward them. It was Howe, who dismounted. as he reached his master's side, aid touched his hat. "Well, ilIowe, what is it?" "Mr. Tinsdale has arrived, my lord." "'Ah,'very well Wait for me at the broad road." Howe touched his hat again, mounted and rode away. aharlemount had his hand upon the pommel of the-saddle, while his other 'rm glided round Ruth's waist.,       ; 'I must see .you again to-night," he said. "I must meet t^is man, who goes out of town directly, and I cannot get out here again till    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6470-00000033"/> twelve. I must say five words to you, though. -Have you changed rooms with Regina, as you told me you were going to do?" "Yes," said Ruth, blushing deeply, She sleeps, then, on the other side of the house?" "Yes." "Be at your window at twelve-I can clam- ber up by the trellis-work-" "Charlemount!" "Well, Ruth," he said, haughtily, "do you fear me? I give you my word of honor I have no thought of wrong-I only wish to say a few words more about our arrangements. Are you not almost my wife? Do you think I wish to lead you astray again?" "Oh, no!" "You will be there?" "Yes." "The nights are rather bright, though there is no moon,"'he said, busying himself with the bridle of his horse. "Wrap yourself in some dark mantle-something black, so that your figure may not be seen, in case the policeman should take it into his head to explore the premises." "Very well." "Retire early, saying that you are not well. When will Clifford go?" "About eleven." "When the house is still, I will come and throw a pebble up against the wall. Be on the watch. And now for a few hours good bye, my own'dear bride 1" Those words, and the tender embrace that followed, removed the last of Ruth's scruples. She watched him gallop up the lane, with proud and loving eyes. She did not know, poor child, that as he joined the expectant Howe, he groaned out: "It was well done, my good fellow, but I hate myself for it, and you, too!" Howe smiled respectfully. "My lord, you will soon get over thins She  has cosaented." "Yes, poor thing! Thisis the worst of all my rascalities, Howe! Even that wretched wife of mine"-and he shuddered at the mention of her name-" was never used, is Ruth has been. Poor Ruth, she will go mad, Howe, when she finds it all out. Her blood will be on my head."   Howe took the liberty of shrugging his shoulders.         , My lord, I think she will recover 1' "Ah, you have a heart of stone l" And so have women, every one, of them, my lord ' "Well," said the earl, "it cannot be helped now. I would sacrifice ten thousand Ruths t- gain one Regina. There must be no bungling in the business now, let it cost what it may." "There shall be none, my lord," said Howe, as he fell back into his place, and followed his master in the swift ride to the gates of Charle- mount House. Meanwhile, Ruth, according to her lover's directions, leaving Regina and Clifford in the study, had went to her own room to watch and wait for his return. Alas, for poor Ruth, for you also it was the last vigil, and you knew it not. At exactly half-past eleven, a tall figure, wrapped -in a cloak, and wearing a slouched hat, scaled the garden-wall, and leaping dowi beside the fountain, looked toward the house. Another followed, and both concealing them- selves in the shrubbery, waited patiently for the neighboring clock to toll the hour of mid- night. "We dodged the policeman, cleverly, Howe!" said the earl. But look at that light mov. ing in the hall! By Heaven, the fellow has not yet gone." The outer door unclosed.; asid Clifford, fol- lowed by Regina, came out and stood upon the steps, looking upat the calm night sky. No moon," said Regina, leaning on his shoulder; "And yet how distinctly we can see the garden and the lane! I will go with you to the gate."  "No man ever had a sweeter or 'a fairer guide 1" said Clifford, as he put his arm round her, and sauntered down the path. " O Regi-' na, I am so happy with you, that I am posi. tively afraid that-" ' Of what? A ghost " she answered, play. fully. "Rush declares this garden is haunted, and I think I heard something stir, near the fountain, justnow." "Shall I go and'see?"' "Did you hear it, too?" "Yes!"   "Well, never mind it. I dare say it was only a stray cat." They went farther along the walk; and the earl and his companion breathed more freely again. Charlemount's eyes glittered with a lurid light as he watched them standing at the gate-young, beautiful, and loving. It was such a gaze as Lucifer might have fastened upon another pair, more innocent, and in a garden far more beautiful than this. - "When will you come again?"' asked Re- gina. "To-morrow, if I may." "'To-morrow, of course! But what time?" "You shall fame it." "After luncheon, I think. Ruth and I are going to be very busy all the morning, but I shall be at leisure then, and' you shall ride with me, if you like." "What are you and Ruth going to do?" "Mischief!"  , "That I supposed. "But of what kind.?" ' You should not ask such questions-you never know what answer you may get. Per- haps we may show you what we have been about, when, you come."  "You will be trimming bonnets and gowns all the morning, and talking scandal."  "Not another word, sir!  Bonnets and' gowns, indeed I You have been told, a thou- sand times, to say' dreesses. Restrain your cu- riosity for twelve hours; and now good night." She pushed him playfully out through the gate, but he was back again in a moment by her side. "You would be quite wild if I left you in that way, Regina so yOU may as well make your adieus properly.': "Very well; bend down your head." He did so, and received a sound box on the ear. Half frightened at the answer she had given to his teasing speech, she darted away; but he caught her in his arms, before she had 'made a dozen steps, and'revenged himself am- ply for his tingling cheek.  "There, the quarter' is striking!" she said, imploringly. "Prudence will be horrified l. Do go-there's a good boy." "I am going. "Good-night, darling I Sleep well, and dream of me." With the last kiss, they parted. Regina   s closed and bolted the gate, and went slowly up toward the house.  e  "Too happy," she murmured, as she passed r the concealed listeiers-"I am afraid we are, -indeed. God grant it may last." She stood for one moment on the steps, look. ing silently upward-then going in, the two/ watchers heard the heavy bolt and chain of the I hall door fall into their places, and saw through the latticed windows the gleam of her light go slowly up the stairs. They rose to their feet. The earl was dead- ly pale. "Howe," he whispered, grasping his serv, ant's arm, A"I would have struck the fellow -dead at my feet. That he should dare to hold her in his arms, and touch her lips. Before my very eyes, too!" and he uttered a terrible oath. "My lord," said Howe, soothingly, "you will soon be able to make him suffer more than you are suffering'now." "Ah I Well, we will begin. Do you hear him? Are you sure he watches her each night?" "I have dogged him up sand down a score of times before she went away, arid seen him stand outside the gates and look at her light till it' went out, as ifit was a new star. Hark! don't you hear him now?" Claremount listened. Clifford, pacing up and: down in the lonely lane, was humming the air of a passionate Indian serenade.  "We will teach him another song; we will learn him to go quietly to bed, instead of watching his lady-love's windows!" said the earl, laughing.' Give me a handful of debt bles." Howe picked up a few from the sandy soil beside the fountain. Charlemount, leaving him in the shrubbery, stole' across the grass, and threw them up against the wall. A win dow opened softly over his head. "Hush it is only me l" he whispered. At that moment, a noise like the chirping of a cricket made him turn his head. It was th concerted signal of an approach, and he die- tinctly saw a'head appearing bver the garden- wall, close beside the gate. The climber took off his hat, and bent forward among the rust- ling branches of the trees; his fair hair an j o    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6470-00000034"/> slender figure shining distinctly against the. background of the quiet sky.   "Good!" I thought Charlemount, smiling to himself-   -- Clifford is there ; and if that fool of a polioe- man does not take it into his head to search the lane, at present, all woll go as I wish. Here 1 goes now, for Regina! I might as well strike, a dagger into the heart of that idiot, yonder, ] as to climb this shaky bit of lattice work." He mounted gayly; Ruth, wrapped in the cloak of sables, with her long hair unbound and i falling over her shoulders, watched him breath- lesely, and held out her hands to aid him, as he neared her. Clifford, seeing this, groaned aud- ibly, and Howe chuckled in the shade. The carl entered,the chamber-Clifford. still watch-  ed, with straining eyes, while drops of perspire ation stood upon his brow. Charlemount's stay exceeded the half-hour; though, ddring that time, he seemed so absent and anxious-not to say cold-that poor Ruth was sadly puzzled to account for his behavior. On rising to go, however, his manner 'grew warmer. He laid a purse upon the table. "It is for your journey, my little bride."' \ "And when shall I see you again?'9  "The moment I can get free from my law- yer," he said, raising the window gently. ", It is possible that I may not write before I come; but Howe will be with you. Take care of yourself for my sake, my love." He drew her, fondly, to his breast. Her arms were around his neck-her head upon Ils shoulder-her lips meeting his. All this Clif- ford saw, through the open casement, by the light of the lamp upon the table ia the back- ground, though the face itself was hidden from him. "' I am mad! I am dreaming!" he said, aloud. ,' O Regina I you can never be so utterly lost to all truth and honor as this?" The earl was descending: but when half- way down, a whisper called him back. , Oh, tell ire when we shall meet again?" Clifford..herd the words as well. , Not to-morrow. He will be wqith you!" was the low reply. "I No, not to-morrow!" murmured the sweet- er voice. ,' But, oh, do not stay from me long. You must lnow that no one caun supply your places -however devoted they may be."'   My darling, it is only for a Short time; that I leave you to, him. Once more, good-night- once:.wre! ' "Once more,'? indeed  .Clifford sa w tit delicate figure bend from the casement-saw those white arims rest upon the strangqr'a shoulder--saw a long, long embrace. Wbhn had she shared so close a one with him? And w ho--who was this man, who had dashed the cup of happiness from his lips, and made him the, most wretched creature that trod the earth? He would know; before the deadly struggle commenced between them. Only one had be feared--thaft one was far away. This enemy was the more accursed, because he was a secret 'one. Slowly'and feebly, without one 'last look at the casement he, had so often and so fondly watched, he descended from his post of obseri- vation. A moment passed-bhe heard .voices behind the wall-then the cloaked figure of the stranger sprang down into the lane, fol- lowed by another, not quite so stately or pow erful. Clifford's hand was upon his throat in an instant.   : "Who are you, sir-and why a-e you here?" The stranger struggled at first, as if he wish ed to free himself; but Clifford, endowed by his terrible agony with a strength almost mi raculous, kept his steady hold. "Let me go, or it will be the worse for you!" "That voice!" said Clifford, releasing him, and staggering back as if he had been struck. "Not you not you!" Charlemount doffed his hat, and made him a courtly bow. Clifford gazed a m ment into his flushed, handsome face; his own grew white even to the lips; he sprang forward, but be- fore he could aim a h!,'w at his mocking qene- my, he fell heavily at his feet. The policeman just turning into the lane heard the noise, and ran to the spot. t Charlemount concealed his face with his cloak. Howe helped the police- man to raise the body, and laid his hand upon his heart. "( All right!" he said, jocosely. "The gen- tleman fainted. He is coming to, now. Take him to the nearest cab-stand, and tell the dri- ver to put him down st Wo. 40 Jermyn street. Or, stay! I will go with you 1'9  They walked away, supporting the reviving   Clifford between them. In ten minutes, Howe rejoined his master, and, hiring anther cab, they drove quietly toward home. *    *    *    *    * Regina coming down rather late to break- fast on the foliowing morning, was surprised to see the ubiquitous John kneeling over an im- perial in the hall, and tightening its straps, preparatory to raising it to his shoulder. See- imlg his mistress, he paused in his occupation, and bade her a cordial and civil good morning. "What are you doing there?" she asked. - I am only going to take this to the cab, while Miss Ruth finishes her breakfast," he ex- plained. "And what has Miss Tluth to do with it?" was on her lips ; but she checked herself, and entered the study, now become their common breakfast-room. Though the day wos bright and clear, the first damp chill of autumn was in the air, and the sight of the garden trees r .cking about in the high wind that was abroad, made the fire on the hearth a pleasanter object than it would have been a month previous. Before it sat Rath, fully equipped for travel-  ing, in a gray straw bonnet and a mering dress of the same hue ; her gloves lay upon the ta- ble, beside a small basket, into whose recesses Peter was peering with very inquisitive blue eyes. Her plate and cup were pushed aside-- her hands were clasped upon her knee-and though her eyes were fixed upon the red mass of coals before her, her thoughts were evident- ly far away-probably, they were already be. ginning the; journey she was so soon to under- take. Regina went up and touched her on the shoulder. She started, and seeing who it was, blushed deeply, and snatched her gloves out of the claws of Peter, who seemed bent on adding them to his stock of buried treasures by the garden wall.              X "' Well, Ruth!" "Well, Regia!" That was their usuat morning salutation, but now it was uttered a little nervously by both. Ruth took her white hand, still resting on her slioulder, and touched it with her lips. "I am doing homage to Queen Zenobia!" "Not for the last time?'" "Heaven forbid I   Why do you look so   5 grave, Regina? Why do you not ask me where I am going P" "You know very well, Ruth, that .if you should see me ' booted and spurred' for a ride across the Alps, or a voyage to Lapland, you would not open your lips except to say Bo n voyage 1' Would you?" "Possibly not. But then I am peculiar." "So am I. We are a pair, I think; and I say 'Bon voyage' to you." "Nothing more?" "Nothing!" Ruth looked anxiously in the half-averted face. "Regina, are you vexed?' "Not a whit." "What then?" "Grieved-provoked-indignant t" Ah!" "Not with you, though, little Ruthie!" "With whom, then?" "With him!" said Regina, emphatically. Ruth started. "Who told you?" she said ; and then, check- ing herself, she began to examine her bonnet- strings very intently. "I hope you like their color?" said Regioa, sarcastically.  "O Ruth, my dear child! if you were not going to tell me your secret, why did you not take yourself off before I came. down?-why did you post yourself here in front of my breakfast-table, with that secret written so plainly in your face that an idiot might read it?" "Do you read it?" "I do." "Read it aloud, then.?' Regina bent playfully over her, and looked into her deep, sweet eyes. "Here it is plainest. Shall I go on?" "Yeq." "Ruth has had a letter from that very pos sible ' he' this morning. Ruth is going to do something which he advises (another word for commanding), even though, in obeying, shid makes a hole in Regina's heart." "Nonsense!" cried Ruth; glad to escape that close, true scrutiny. "Regina's heart is filled." "Isa it?" said the actress, with a wistful smile. "I should like to know how'?" "Clifford!" Z .i    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6470-00000035"/> "Bah!" "I wish he heard you." "He might if he liked. No doubt he would be vexed; but the .truth is, Ruth, that how- ever dear he may be to me, he could not fill the place you hold. If I lost you, the loss would never be over, though he was for ever by my side.' Much moved, Ruth drew nearer, and, hold- ing each other's hands, they stood looking thoughtfully into the fire. One had learned, by continued experience, that the warmest and  most perfect love may vanish in an instant, and that no earthly support is to be depended upon, except it be the support of that firm, steady friendship, which, springing up sometimes be- tween persons of the same sex, can have neither jealbusy nor passion to disturb its course; and so it flows quietly and swiftly on to the very bor- ders of the grave. The other had not yet mas- tered this most necessary truth, yet the yearn- ing tenderness of her friend and sister affected her deeply. Charlemount never could be false -love never could fail- said her happy heart; yet, somewhere in the dark recesses of her thoughts, lurked an unacknowledged 'if'; and to this dreaded, though half-unrecognized monster, it was sweet to present the firm front and steady face of a friendship like Regina's. This was the lovely land where she might come to die in peace, if by any unforeseen and most improbable chance some arrow laid her low. Poor little Ruth I It was a comfort to remem- ber this when the dark days came on. "How long am I to lose my household fairy?" asked Regina, at last. "' Am I that to you?" "Do you not know it yet? I shall wander through the deserted rooms and the deserted garden with a very heavy heart; I shall look up at your window, and sigh, ,because you are not there; I shall watch the autumn rose you planted, till its buds unfold; and then- untill then, I shall be happy again i Then you will come back, for you said, in the spring that we would watch those latest flowers open to- gether." "Did I?" Tears filled the soft brown eyes. The sim- ple, happy life which she and Regina had 'marked out for themselves-where was it nrw?   Had they done wrong, in allowing others to share, and therefore, of necessity, to spoil it? "When those roses bloom," she said, in, a low voice, "I shall not be here I shall be far, very far away!" Regina started-then sighed, and dropped her hand. "I see it all, Ruth! Our pleasant dream is over." Yes, it is over!" "We have been very foolish, my poor child. There was no serpent in' our paradise till I opened the gate-and if I had not done so, there would have been none till this day." "We do not know that!" "I do, if you do not! I paved the way for this separation, by allowing myself to be daz zled by the glances of blue eyes, and the gleaming of yellow hair: If my heart had not been, according to your idea, filled, Hquestion if-this love of yours would have been so read- ily welcomed back. .What you fancied you could not find in Regina, you sought in him! I wish you joy' of it!" "Why, how bitter you are!" "I know it; 'but is it not vexing and hu miliating to think that we, who had found peace, and ought to have known what peace was worth, should go and risk it again the mo- ment an opportunity offered?" "Ah, we shall be happier with them than we have been here 1" said Ruth, with a smile., Regina eyed her with a half-tender, half con- temptuous glance. "You are one degree better than I am. You wear your chains with a grace-mine gall and fret me, though I am not strong enough to throw them off. Mark my words, Ruth-in six months after we have left this little cot- tage, we shall be ready to give our ears to get back again." Ruth shook her head, and looked very un- believing. "Well, it can't be helped now. So tell me -am I to see you here again?" "Yes." "And when?"  "You must not tell Clifford." ' "Fudge, childI Do you fancy I tell him everything I hear, or say, or do, or think, or feel? I am not so far gone as that, yet."   "i Well, then, I shall not come till-I am married!" Regina gave a little clear, sweet whistle of surprise. "Is he in England, then?" "Yee; he followed us at once from Paris." "And have you seen him?"  Ruth blushed and smiled. "Ah, little traitor! that explains the long valk in the lane, last evening. But you were t, be married with me-we were to assume our halters together! How is this? ' "My dear Regina, that is just a hat I must not tell you. There are reasons why our mar- riage must be immediate and private." Regina began to look very grave. "Let no one make a fool of you, Ruth." "Now you are unjust." "You are quite sure no treachery was intend- ed?"       - "Quite! His confidential servant attends me, and remains, with me. The settlements are being prepared,and he will join me as soon as the lawyers can spare him-then we shall be married. I shall pay you a jshort visit -and p abroad." "Shall I see him?" "Not just yet," was the evasive reply. ( But beforo long I can tell you all. Dear Regina, the only thing that pains me is, that I may not  tell you now."  "I say, frankly, that this secrecy does not  suit me. Be on your guard, Ruth-be sure  that he is honest and true, before you go too 1 far. More, I need not add."  "There are good reasons," pleaded Ruth. E "Very well, You are, at least, old enough t and wise enough to take care of yourself, after    having been warned. How soon shall I see you"    -  "n a very few weeks." "Will you write?" "If anything goes wrong-not unless." "Very well. But, if I get that letter, woe be' to the man who causes you to write it 1" "You shall not judge him so!" "Poor little child!" said Regina, patting her on the head. "He must be a villain, in- deed, if he could wrong you a second timue. Remember, Ruth, I depend on you to tell me if matrimony is really endurable. Sometimes I fancy not. The very idea of seeing the saene face, day after day, over the coffee-pot, looks almost unbearable, now and then." Ruth had no opportunity to reply to this outhurst, for John announced that the cabman had only time to reach the station from which she was to start. She snatched up her gloves and basket, and ran down the garden-path, followed by Regina, who saw her safely into the cab. All my sunshine goes with you!" she said, fondly. "Bring it back soon." "Very soon-and brighter than ever!" was the gay reply. It was a peculiarity of their intercourse, and their friendship, that anything like a caress was seldom exchanged between them. Only once-and that at the beginning of that friend- ship - had their lips met. Now, as they part- ed, they simply held each other's hands a mo. ment, and said, "Good-bye!" Yet, not the less sadly for that, did Regina watch the clum- sy vehicle out of sight-not -less lonely was  she as she went back into the quiet house- the nest from which the quick-eyed bird had flown. boom. O      x          . .     <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6470-00000036"/> CHAPTER VII. You came in to my tent with-friendly greeting- Of all my joys you had the better part- Then, when our eyes and hands were oftenest meet- ing, You struck me to the heart  No less a murderer than your victim, living, Can face the hollow world, and jest, and smile- No less a traitor for your show of giving Your "friendship" all the while!-M. B.   It is one of the most unbearable feelings on earth--that of being left. Regina looked very sadly around the study, and pushed away Ruth's chair, and Ruth's cup and plate, with a heavy sigh. "My morning is likely to be a pleasant one," she said, half pettishly, as she rang the bell for the dumb-waiter. "No Ruth-no Clifford -no play-no work-heigho! What a very useless thing a human being is when left en- tirely to himself, or herself, as the case may be!" Breakfast came; and over it, and a new book, she partly forgot her trouble. The day wore away; but Clifford did not appear at the appointed time. It was long after luncheon when the faithful Prudence beard his knock at the door. Regina, lonely and listless, was stretched out upon her sofa by the fire, when he entered, and did not rise-she only lifted her hand over her head, and said, without look- ing at him:  "How do you do  You are very late; and I detest people who are not punctual. As I do not feel inclined to talk to you just at this mo- ment. you may sit down in the corner, and do penance, if you like, for not coming sooner." Not for worlds would Clifford have touched that white hand. He moved toward the sofa, and, leaning against the mantel-piece, looked gloomily into the fire without answering her. "Oh, you will not speak I Your dignity is hurt, I suppose, by my off-hand greeting! \   Very well-keep silence! I tell you, frankly I am in a bad humor, and we shall only quar rel if you open your lips.." "I do not doubt that!" She looked at him curiously, then yawned, and closed her eyes. He shifted his position, and, turning his head on his hand, gazed down on her. How beautiful she was - lying carelessly there, beneath the crimson shawl Prudence had thrown over her, like some dark, bright flower, drooping on its stem. He thought of Helen Erlinford's words, which Charlemount had re- peated to him one, day-4' Crimson and gold are the only colors for Regina." They were true; they painted both her inner and her outer nature better than any others could have done. Fire and passion breathed from every lineament of that mobile faee; fire and pas. sion nestled under the lids of the closed eyes. fire and passion glowed in every movement of the now quiescent form!. What had he to do with a woman like this? How could he, for one moment, have expected her to become the gentle, yielding wife-the home-loving, home- keeping fairy-the tender and devoted mother? Pshaw! This fierce. leaping flame was not the steady light of the household hearth he had wished to kindle-this passionate, hot heart would never have been content to merge itself in his. Power, and pomp, and luxury-these were for the dark daughter of the earth, and these he could not have given her. One could   give them; that one-oh, what a cruel pang that was with which he recialled him!. Lan- guid as she looked now, had she not been in- stinct with love and tenderness last night? Coldly as she greeted him, had she not parted warmly with Charlemount? Nay-what was a far more bitter thought-had she not parted almost as warmly with himself not half an hour previous? Poor, deluded fool that he was! He uttered. an exclamation of rage and grief. Regina heard it, and opened her eyes widely. ", What is the matter, Clifford?" "Yb ask?"' "Most certainly I do! Why are you look- ng at me in that strange way One would think you were a judge and I a criminal, ind that you were about to put on a black cap, and pronounce sentence of death on. me at this mo- ment." "Hal Your conscience is stirring, I see, else you would never have thought of that comparison!" "My conscience?" she said, assuming a sit- ting posture, and looking at' him haughtily. * Will you explain that speech, Clifford? There is room for you on the sofa, if you like 1" and she gathered up the crimson drapery, aiid heaped it in a glowing mass upon the pillows behind her. Sit down, and tell me what is the matter." "I do not wish to sit betide you, Regina." "Very well. Stand, then." "More : I never wish to sit beside you again  nor do I ever mean to do so!" A deep flush stained her cheek, and her eyes flashed for an instant on him. "Ah! I perceive work lies before us I Well, go on  Don't mind matters! Speak out freely what you wish!" "I will. There have been certain promises between us, Regina." "Yes." "I wish to give back all yours--to claim my own again." She grew white, and, irising Bidddtily, filled a glass from the table ivith water, and drank it. He watched her with a smile. It soothed his wounded pride to she that mute token of her love for him. 'hte shiii biad notibi Vished When she came back, and, leaning against the sofa, stood prepaed thto'  a h eer hie h to siy.   "Did 'ou understand me, Regina?" "Yes You wish to be free again. Well, I free you!" and she made a passionate gesture with her hand. "Leave me as soon as you like. I will never trouble you more 1" "On my part, I resign all claim to a lady so fair, and," he added, with a sneer, 'so very kind!" "Thank you!" she answered, steadily rais. ing her eyes to his. "And, now that no ties bind us, tell me what those last words mean." "Ask the earl." Who?" "The Earl of Charlemount. Surely, I need not designate him moie plainly." "' What havd I to do with him?" He gave a low, insulting liugh, that made her turn crimson, and took up his hat, as if to go. She made a step forward, and stood in his way. "Mr. Cliffoid, I do iiot know what an En- glishwomaing will stand; but I can tell you that a Freinchwoman is ilot to be insulted with iin- punity. Out of this room you do not stir un- til I know what has changed you so!" "As you choose. But I hardly think it wil be pleasant for you to hear the tale from my lips." "Out with it i" ' Well, then, you remember it *as very late wlnen I left you last evening." Only half-past eleven." "I stayed beyonid my usual time.  You urged me once or twice to go; but ydu smiled so sweetly when you spoke, that I was, ai it were, compelled to stay. You were not wise in doing so, Regina." "I begin to believe it. 'But I shall offend that way no more." "Not with me! And, if I may advise you in such a delicate matter, you will do well ri6er to give the earl an equally good 'chAne. of finding out what (however closely it manu concern him) it cannot 'add to his peace or happiness to know." "Keep to your sibry, and wait till I ask your advice." "No doubt you understand the little mat- ters better than I. Well, to go back to my tale. After I left you- after you gave me that last kiss, which burns at this moment' or my    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6470-00000037"/> tips, though I would give worlds to forget it- I happened, as I often do, to take a fancy to watch your casement." "Watch?" "Rest easy. I certainly little expected to see-what I did see! I only walked up and down the lane, as I have often done before, feeling a kind of fanciful pleasure in guarding your house while you slept. I used to be fool- ish enough to think that you' must slumber more sweetly because I was near, though you knew it not." 'Go on-go on!" said Regina, hurriedly. For Heaven's sake, don't talk of these things -of these feelings-now I I am not yet mar- ble or iron-and I cannot bear to hear them." "I do not wonder. Weil, as I was watching the house and the moon, and thinking of all you had said and looked during the happy hours we had just spent together, I heard a slight noise in the garden. We heard it, as you may remember, as we stood by the gate, and I pro- posed to ascertain what caused it. But you drew me back. You said it must be a stray eat." "Yes." 'If you had said a stray wolf, you would ave hit the mark nearer. O Regina! how air, how false you women can be!" "That is an old story. Every one has told it since the world began," she said, bitterly. I am more interested in this new one. What did your stray wolf turn out to be?' "The earl!" Regina started violently, but recovering her- self the next moment, exclaimed  "Kemble would not have spoken it more tragically. Pray, go on!" "Hearing this noise, I paused to listen. I thought I could distinguish voices. I came nearer. I heard a pebble thrown up against the window. I heard that window open soft- ly-" "Well?" "I climbed up by the garden gate, and looked over through the branches of the elm-" "And you saw Elizabeth, the housemaid, I suppose, giving the cold meat, through the pantry window to a cousin, and, perhaps, ex- hanging a kiss with him at the same time."   "Kisses were exchanged, but not: between Elizabeth and her cousin. The. window was higher-it was yours, Regina!" "Ah!" "No wonder you pale " "What more did you see?" "Something very trifling - hardly worth speaking about." "Nevertheless, I should like to hear it." "A female figure stood in that window, help- ing the earl in his ascent. That figure was tall and very slight; long, dark hair fell over its  shoulders; it was singular how much it resem- bled yours. As for the cloak of sables, I have seen you wear one. precisely like it a thousand times." "The earl entered thi&amp; chamber?' "He did.". "For a moment or two, possibly?" On the contrary, he remained more thab half an hour." "And then?" "The window opened, and he descended- not without a very fond ,embrace, however, from' the lady, which I witnessed with a pecu- liar pleasure, as you may well imagine. Her voice called him back. Though it was buta whisper, I heard it well." "Indeed! What did she say?" "This: ' Oh, tell me when we shall meet again?' Then: ' Not to-morrow; but oh, do not stay from me long I You must know that no one can supply your place, however devoted they may be!' A pleasant thing for me to hear, was it not?" "Very. What di4 you do next?" "I descended, and waited in the lane. Two strangers followed me. I sprang forward, and insisted on seeing this happy lover's face. He was so obliging as to grant my request. He doffed his hat, .and mdde me a courteour bow-" "And it was-" "The Earl of Charlemount." "Then you parted, I suppose?" "We did." ' Peaceably?" "Oh, yes? Why should we do otherwise? "You went to your own home-he to. his?" "' Quite right," replied Clifford, who was far too proud to show her what the discovery cost   him, or to tell her how he went to his lodgings. a  Regina, having heard all, stood lookin, thoughtfully into the fire. Startling as was the story, she could yet understand it. Char- ]emount must have been the mysterious lover of Ruth-he must have met her on the pre- vious night. .Ruth had been very rash and imprudent in admitting him to her chamber- still, she felt quite certain that nothing wrong had transpired. Yet, could it have been Char. lemount? Might not Clifford, already jealous of him, have mistaken the stranger's face 1 She inclined to this opinion. That Ciifford had suffered more than he would allow, she saw plainly, and she was willing to forgive much of his injustice-was ready to give him such an explanation as should clear herself, ) et also preserve Ruth's secret and Ruth's rep- utation. Well," said Clifford, who had been watch- ing her face, " what have you to say?" "Very much. In the first place, I think you were mistaken about the earl. I am very sure it could not have been him." "No doubt I dreamed it all, from beginning to end, Regina!" "Would you be glad to know that it was a dream-at least, so far as I am concerned?" "Do you mean to tell me that you were not at that window?" "I do." "Thaj you did not send me from you in or- der that he might make his exceedingly rep- utable visit to your chamber?" "I do." "I suppose, too, you will say that your meeting in Paris was quite accidental?" "It certainly was," "He was not in Italy with you?" "No." "In Germany?" "By no' means." "In the Landes, then?" "Are you beside yourself; sir?"  "You. must think me so, if you attempt to  make me believe such' assertions, after what I 1 saw last evening." "You are jealous, and pained, and hurt. I e do not wonder. But when I say to you that I have never in my life spoken one word to the  Earl of Charlemount, will you believe me?" 1   "Upon your honor?" ' Upon my honor!" He laughed bitterly. "Is it possible that you doubt it?" "What-your honor? How can you fancy such a preposterous thing?" A dark red flush ran to Regina's forehead- she passed her hand over her eyes in a bewil- dered, way. "Clifford, do you know what you are saying -do you know what you are doing? You are breaking my heart!" It is strange how cruel we can be to what we' love. As she said those words, a kindred pang pierced his own breast; but it only hurried him on to fresh insults. He tortured himself as he tortured her, and the pain and the agony fed the rage he felt. "How can that affect me?" he asked, care- lessly. "With your heart I have nothing more to do. It is CYhrlemount's affair, not mine." She looked at him as a wounded deer looks at its murderer when the knife is at its throat. "My God!" she murmured, with clasped hands. "This-this is what I have loved as much better than Thee!" Clifford was silent. At last, in a more sub. dued tone, he said "I think all has been told that is necessary. Shall I go?"  "Wait -wait one moment. I have been called a proud woman-- suppose Iam proud; yet I feel humble enough now. We must part -I know that for you have uttered words 'that could never be forgotten, thoughg they might be forgiven. But before you go, let me kear you say that it was only in anger you spoke I Tell me that you do not really believe I am so utterly lost-" Her voice faltered. But he would not speak. "I am not asking an apology. But a part- ing like this will be so' bitter-I cannot bear it. If you will not say it, Clifford, give me your hand. I shall know then' that, after all, you feel in your heart that Regina was true!" In spite of himself, his lip quivered, and she saw it. "You love me still!" she cried. "Why will you pain me?- Let us part friends 1"And she laid her hand on his arm, and looked up at him    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6470-00000038"/> with a smile so very pitiful to see on lips so proud as hers. For one moment he wavered. It was hard to meet those eyeS, and to look at that face- now, indeed, the very face of the picture He ha s d stroyed-without casting all doubts to the winds, and clasping her to his heart once more. But the thought of Charlemount came, and he shook off her hand. ,R-gins, you mistake, me. I do not love you! I cannot love a woman I do not re- spect!" "You believe it all, then?" I do!" ' You think I met him abroad?" ' And that he was with you during all those months of pleasant travel-yes." "Once more-as there is a God in heaven who hears me, he was not 1" "Do not add perjury to falsehood, Re- gina!" "Ah, well! go, and leave me. I thought it would end in some such way, Clifford." "You had planned this pleasant little finale, then, to our intercourse?" "What?" You were about to marry me, thinking me so conveniently blind, that the earl--" "' Good heavens! are you going to Insult me again-and now? In five moments we shall havelooked our last on each other? Will you make your farewell word a taunt?" "I will make it the truth!" said Clifford, who was utterly beside himself with grief and anger. * Good-morning!" His hand was on the lock of the door, when a cry broke from her lips, so full of bitter pain, that he paused, She was leaning against the sofa, with her hands clasped convulsively over her heart. "Ah I you can feel-you can weep!" , I am not weeping." "'What then?" i( Nothing that you need stay fbr. I felt my heart breaking-that was all 1" "Hearts only break in -novels, my dear child!" The old pet iname, tse'd as a taunt, was the last drop in her cup of misery. God forgive you, Clifford!" she exclaimed;   and then coming beside him, she held the doc open and motioned him him out. " Go!" It all endE here!" he said, looking back in- to the plsa'ant tootn, as Ad'm mnight have lobked back into Pradise after the angel drove him out. "It does."  "And then shal .;you marry the earl, Rc- gina -"   A tremor ran over her from head to foot as she turned her white face toward him. "I am at your mercy," she said, feebly; "but spare me! Strike no more blows! Go- go-before you kill me i" He went. Before he reached the hall-door, he heard that of the 'study bolted and looked. He stopped and listened, but all was still as death. The heart might bleed and break, but it could do both silently I Trembling with rage and anguish, Clifford rushed from the house. Prudence opened the gate for him, but shrank back, with a little cry  of dismay, when she saw the pallor of his fae. and the fire of his wild blue eyes. "You have been breaking the poor child's heart!" she exclaimed. "I hope so!"Was the savage reply. And springing into a cab, hM gave the order, ' Tc Charlemount House 1" and dashed away, leav- ing Prudence quite aghast with horror and grief. ", What has she done to him that he should speak like that?" she murmured, as she fas- tened the bolt. "1 will go to her--perhaps I may comfort her." She hurried in, aftd knocked at the sthdy door. No one answered-she tried: to open it -but it was locked. Then she uiderstood the whole; and lifting h'h muslin apron to her eyes, she turned sorrowfully away. "Alas! that such creattures as men shoeld be allowed to abide on thist eautiful tarth!" she sighed. "It is to be hopei they will be repaid one day or another for all they tmake usi suffed." It was not a very ehAritAhlJ Wish, bdr. a thoroughly natural one; an I I a'i afiraid others berides Prudeioe have uihetd it ere noW. The cab flew down Pincadilly, et*ogh the gathering dusk, as if pursuel by a'r; tql 8Xirit,   rather than bearing one. Clifford looked, with aching eyes, at the long line of lights that stretched eastward. "Shall I never reach him " he ground through his clenched teeth. "I shall go mad with tils crawling pace! Oh, if he were here beside me-if only my hand was on his throat agaiu, as it was last night It would not be as soft an embrace as Regiaa-curses on her!- gave to him at parting. Nothing-nothing but his heart's blood is goisg to wash out all this shame and misery of mine!" The cab stopped suddenly, and the driver, descending, looked in, rather apprehensively, at his passenger. "Charlemount House, sir. Shall I knock?" "You? No! Get out of' my way!" ex- claimed Clifford, flinging him a piece of gold, and, darting up the steps. A solemn-looking porter barred the way. "Very sorry, sir, but my lord is engaged." "Who with ' "He is at dinner." "Alone?" "Yes, sir." "Then send up that card, with the message that the bearer must and will see him at once. Be quick about it." A servant in livery came forward and took the note, and disappeared with great celerity, when he caught sight of Clifford's face. The porter was, evidently, ill at ease, and wonder- ing who on earth the saucy stranger could be, who dared send such a message to the Earl of Oharlemount. Clifford took no notice of him; but, as the servant returned, he made a quick step forward, "Well, can I see his lordship?" "Yes, sir." Clifford smiled, and followed him. The cab. man, who watched his proceedings from the steps, now ventured, a word of advice to the stout porter. "You'd better be ready, my friend, in case of a 'scrimmage',up stairs. If you want a policeman, just put your head out of the door --I'm going to wait till I see the end ofit. A man doesn't give a half a sovereign for a two- shilling piece, unless he's as mad as a March hare-that's ny opinion.!" Having expressed it, he retreated, and, slip-   ping the nose-bag over his horse's head, walked up and down the parement in front of the ,house, like an amateur patrol. The porter shut the door with an air of intense disgust. A " scrimmage " in Charlemount House, and a cabman acting as special constable! What was this world coming to? The earl was ndt alone. Howe had been hastily summoned, and with him came a law- yer's clerk, who had just arrived, bearing some  deeds and bonds for Charlemount to sign. He spread them quickly on the table before him, so that, as Clifford entered, he saw parchment, grapes, and wine mingled in strange confusion on the board; while the young clerk stared at him with wide-open mouth and eyes, and Howe took up his post behind his master's chair, evidently ready to die in his defense, if neces- sary. He stopped short as the earl rose and turned toward him. "If my memory serves me right, it is nearly four-nay, five months since Mr. Clifford entered this room. To what may I attribute the pleasure of his company now?" "My lord, what I have to say to you cannot be said in the presence of witnesses!" "I am sorry to hear it!" was Charlemount's courteous reply. "Perhaps you will consent to waive that objection; as matters stand be- tween us, I prefer having them present!" "Are you afraid of me?" asked Clifford, tauntingly. The red blood flushed all over the ear's face, and his hand clenched involuntarily at the in- sult. But he controlled himself with a great effort, and answered, haughtily  "I am not afraid of you, Mr. Clifford ' May I begyou to proceed t" "I have to thank you, I suppose, for my safe arrival at my lodgings, last evening?" "   You are quite welcome to any assistance I may have given!" "No doubt  I also have to thank you for opening eyes that have long been closed-for showing me that-that-S e-  - "I ad ise you to mention no names 1!" "By Heaven! do you dire to dictate to me? Do you dare to tell me how'to name herwhom you have rendered 'unfit to be'named by honor.  able men?" '       e     "Take care, sir!" said the earl, turning very    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6470-00000039"/> pale. *Do not go too far! I warn you that my patience has a limit!" "I hope it has-I trust it has!" cried Clif- ford, coming up to him. "Tell me how to go beyond that limit?" "One step farther, sir!"'. "I will take it. Lord Charlemount, you are a coward and a villain! You have stolen from me the only thing that made life worth the living-" "I own it!" said the earl, looking at him. "And if I bear with you to-day as I would brar with no other man on earth, it is because tmy conscience tells me that I have no right to lift my hand against you, since I have wronged you far more deeply than you know!" These last words drove Clifford mad with rage.' You own it! You dare-and to me!" he erie4, hoarsely. "Can I not rouse you in any way  Will you not avenge that, Lord Charle- movnt?" He struck him full in the face, and the next instant would have been laid prostrate at his feet by an answering blow, had not Howe sprang forward and caught his master's arm, while the attorney's clerk performed the same good office in Clifford's behalf. "Let me go, Howe I Did you not see him strike me?" gasped Charlemount. "Out of my path, I tell youl" "Action for assault and battery, my lord 1" cried the clerk. Clifford shook off his grasp, and drew a brace of pistols from his breast.  J * I thought these would be needed. They are small, but they will do their duty well. Choose one!" Charlemount took one mechanically, and watched him as he went around and locked the door. * Is it your purpose to fight here?" , It is!" "Very well; I have no objection. Howe, and you, Mr. Griffiths, bear witness, if anything serious happens, that I was forced into this. Not one word from either of you-it is too late now. Where shall I stand, Mr. Clifford?" "Where I can best shoot you through the heart There, by the table!" The earl shrugged his shoulders. Of mere physical courage he bad plenty, and something   in the intense hatred of his opponent stirred the savage nature up within his breast. He took the place assigned him. Howe sprang toward the bell, but Clifford intercepted him. "Utter one word, make one sound, and you are a dead man I This is a revolver which I hold, and has more than one charge." "Mr. Clifford," said the earl, "before w begin, I beg to eay that the window on you. right opens into a private walk. At its end you will find the stables. A swift horse is al- ways saddled there. In case of your killing me, you may need it-it is at your service. If I am unhappy enough to kill you, I shall avail myself of it. The survivor will have plenty of tipae to get clear. Howe, you are not to un- lock that door for five minutes after we have fired.. Do you hear?" "Yes, my lord 'I groaned poor Howe. "See that you obey. Now, Mr. Clifford, I am ready." Each took his place at one end of the room. "Count, my lord " said Clifford, smiling with savage exultation. "One-two-three!" Both pistols flashed and exploded simulta- neopsly. Charlemount fired in the air; but Clifford aimed straight at him. The ball did its mission-a deadly faintness came over him, and he sank into Howe's arms. "Quick!" he whispered, as Clifford bent over him with a strange feeling, so utterly opposed to his hatred of a moment before, that ,it seemed almost like love. "I do not think you have done for me, but you have no time to lose. Save yourself!" His eyes closed; Clifford looked at him sad- ly for a moment, but a sudden rush of feet on the staircase warned him to escape, and he sprang from the window and dropped into the shrubbery walk beneath. Quick as lightning, the attorney's clerk closed the easement after him; and when the crowd of domestics, police- men, and street passengers forced their way, at last, into the apartment, the earl was reviving, two pistols were lying on the floor, and the room was full of smoke; but Clifford was no- where to-be found. Of this strange duel, and the commotion it caused throughout the metropolis; Regina, its exciting cause, was entirely ignorant.. It was   shrewdly suspected by Captain Tom Grosvenor and his immediate'set, that she was, as they elegantly phrased it, " at the bottom of it all;" and her name was on the lips of club-room gossips, or whispered by matrons in the seclu- sion of their boudoirs, to their intimate lady friends, with an air of profound mystery. Even Helen Erlinford was dimly conscious that something strange had happened, when her mother checked her inquiry after Charle- mount, little thinking, however that it was but a vail to the information she wished, but dared not ask, of Clifford's whereabouts. Three prominent personages-hay, four-had sud- denly vanished from the. eyes of London. Ruth, elevated by Regina's friendship into an object of great interest, had been suddenly and mysteriously'spirited away, lno one knew where, when, how, or by whom. Clifford was wander- ing upon the Continent-the Earl of Charle- mount slowly recovering from the wound in his lung-and Regina, where was she? Shut up from curious eyes in her Prompton cottage, said Tom Grosvenor and the gossips. But they little knew how.  She was fullyepnscious that Clifford's deser. tion could be no secret to her" household. It had been so open, so violent, so insulting, and so sudden, that they could not but understand it. No doubt they pitied her. That thought stung her m;ore than all others. She, the proudest of all human beings-she, who had won hearts only to throw them carelessly away  again for so many years-she, who had desert- ed so many when the fancy Seized her-was Elizabeth the housemaid, was John the foot- man, was Betty the cook, to gossip now to- i gether over the misery that had come upon I her, to watch her pale face and languid step, 1 and compare notes, from day to day, as to her  appetite, her looks, her manner? That, at least, could not be borne. There was a way of preventing it.              d Poor Prudence, knocking, for the sixth or  seventh time, at the study door, as night came t on, was overjoyed at hearing the bolt shot  back at last, and the 'key turned. She ran in, t eager to soothe and comfort her nursling. But d the words died upon her lips.' Regina, looking t more like a marble statue than a human being, t   r stood near the fLa place, and motioned her V bael. "Don't speak, ityou pease, Prudence. At a least, only in answer to my questions. Where - are the bear and buffalo-s rins I used sometimes during our roving days in Texas?" "Up stairs,'i said Prtiience, sadly, for she had a presentiment of what was coming. "Bring them down. Bring also with you a large measure of seed for the birds." Prudence vanished. Regina employed her- self in arranging the furniture of the study. The chairs were ranged against the book- shelves-the centre-table wheeled up in one corner, and the small carved stand put in its place, close to the sofa, and at one side of the fire.' A little Chinese pipe, with a peculbarly- shaped bowl, was on this stand, also a silver box filled with a dark substance, strange in- color, in taste, and in slell. Prudence, re turning laden with a pile of beautiful skins, looked at these things with anxious eyes. "My dear Regina-"  "Not a word. I know all you would say. I will not touch the opium if I can help it; but you don't know how I suffer. There-put them down-T will arrange them myself." With a practiced hand, she spread' a ouch in the centre of' the room, which a wearied hunter might well have coveted. Peter hopped along the floor with a pleased croak, Prince Charlie wagged hiM tail, and Dick, the gray. cat, manifested .his approbation by gravely marching over the furs, and coiling himself up in a round ball in the centre. "I think they really recognize their old friends," said Regina, with a faint smile. "Ah, Prudence! in those wild, free days of camp and bivouac, how little we thought when and where we should use these things again!" "You will not be comfortable.' "I shall sleep well here if I sleep at all. my dear old friend. But, now listen. You know as well as I what has happened. Don't cry- tears will do no good now-they come too late. t have none to shed, at least just yet; but I think-I feel-oh  my bqrt aehes, dear Pru- dence, and I must be aloa-quite alone-for a time. Ruth is away, and there is no one els to oome-."  ' .         /    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6470-00000040"/> Her voice trembled in spite of herself. "You see that I am not yet quite strong  enough to bear it as I ought to. Take care that no one comes near me. The kitchens and offices are on the other side of the house, and  you have stairs leading from them to the sltep-  ing-rooms. Bolt and bar the hall door, and on no pretence let any one pass through this way, or cross the garden on this side." "You shall be obeyed." Tell them to be good to Saladin. They are to leave the stable from twelve till two each day. I shall visit him then. Give them fully to understand that on no account is any servant to be in my way as I come and go; if I meet them, they shall be discharged on the spot-for, through this time of my seclusion, I will not see a single human face-not even yours, dear Prudence." "Well, my dear, if you wish it-" "You may knock at the door three times a day, if you like, and I will answer you. My meals will come at their usual times, by the dumb-waiter-the fire will not be allowed to go out-you must send up coals by the dumb- waiter, too, and I shall be housemaid for a few days." She smiled as she spoke, and looked so much more like her usual self, that Prudence ventur- ed to say: "You will find it all so sad, Regina." "I hope you don't think I am making all these preparations simply to indulge in the luxury of being miserable, On the contrary, X am going to try to drive all this unusual softness out of my hdart, and become once more what I was when I dashedthrough the wild West, and amused myself with the devo- tion of those enthusiastic Americans. I have been taking life much in earnest of late, and I wish to get back again into the old habit of making a jest of everything. A very sorry Regina I have made! When I come out of this den, you will see a Regina in good earn- est!" "Shall I take Prince Charlie away!'. "No; poor little fellow, let him stay-let them all stay, if they like. I can let them out by the French window, if they wish to leave me. I think Peter will amuse me. I have often thought the bird was 'no canny,' and if   so, he's just the companion I need at this time."        '  "Your dresing-case, Regina t ' I brought it down 'myself; it is on the table. Don't concern yourself-I have all I need. If 1 wish for anything more, I will send down a note, and the dumb-waiter. You quite understand about the servants?" "Oh, yes." "One thing more. At your peril, let any one enter these gates who does not belong within these walls!" Her cheeks burned and her eyes flashed,as she said it. She fancied that the truant must return-this was the welcome she prepared for him! "No one shall come, Regina." "Very well. Go now,'and take care of your- self. Don't be unhappy about me; I shall get over it soon. I am going to study Persian while I am shut up here." She led Prudence gently into the hall, kissed her brown cheek, and, going back, locked her- self in. A fairer hermit never dwelt in a stranger cell. A week passed by. No one had seen Re gina's face in all that time. Prince Charli, and the gray cat sometimes took a constitu tional" in the grounds together at nightfall; but during the day they kept close to their silent mistress. Had they been human, they would probably have deserted her, seeing her in trouble; being what we, in our wisdom, are pleased to call "brutes," they clung .o her more closely, and soothed and comforted her far better by their mute sympathy than a thousand words could have done. Even tloh little birds sang more sweetly when Regina listened through her tears; and Peter hovered about the sofa, eyeing her with a curious, side long glance, and muttering things in her ear, which, from his anxious air, must needs have -been wise saws, peculiarly adapted to her especial distress. Her bleeding heart turned back gratefully to those humble friends, and stanched its wounds with the earnest tokens of their love-the. only love, after all, on earth. that never changes-never fails-never grows :cold. The unhappy past seemed farther off, :and far less hard to bear, when the Arabian 'leaned his beautiful head upon her shoulder   s, when Priae Charlie looked up in her face with eyes that seeieed to say: "Tell me how to comfort you-tell me what to do for you!" Alas I have often thought: "What would earth be without these dumb animals?-where slould'we look for sympathy When all himian hearts fail us,if they were not here? only in them can we discern some faint shadow of the Eternal Love lavished upon us nmot, perhaps, when we are most unworthy-only in them do  we see the unwavering fidelity with. which we ought to respond to that touching tenderness I Is it not enough to makethe proudest humble, to think, that for such a lesson we must look, not among human beings, but among brutes?" Qn the tenth evening, Prudence knocked lightly at the study door. Regina, standing at the open window, was watching the setting sun., Her. face had got back its cold, proiud look once more-her thoughts were turning again toward the stage. She was dreaming of a future, even more glorious and more triumph- ant than the past I It was a sign that the crisis was over; for when a heart, after knowing all that hers had known, turns for consolation to ambition, it is because it has forever done with ove. Hearing the summons from the outer world, , Phe walked across the doom and unlocked the door. ,'               : "Am I to come in?" asked the delighted Prudence. "If you like," said Regina, very quietly. And the next instant she was almost stifled  in a close embrace. "There, then-let me get breath!" she said, laughingly. "You are'worse than a grizzly- . bear of the Rocky Mountains!"      ' "Oh, my dear, I am so glad to see you once  more! Ten days I It has seemed like ten  ages Let me look at you!" Regina stepped back, folded her arms, and 1 eibmitted. Prudence gased long at the com- i posed, haughty face, and shook her head. "It is better as it Is!" said Regina, answer- ing her unuttered thought. "Yes-I suppose so. But the opium?" "You must forgive me for that. I could not let it alone. I used it nearly all. If you i come nearer, you will see that I am as yellow 8s a  saffron bag!"   e  Prudence did not see it. The marble-like E pallor of the face was unchanged. But one significant witpess, remained, and told mItely I of tlbe srif fead ag^aish it had seen. On the fair white fQre'head- hat had been so smooth when Clifford's lips had last touched it fondly a -was a single line, tiat. seemed cut deep into e the surface, as if the point of a dagger had , been drawn across it. That one furrow on the brow of youth-how strange a thing it seemed! Tears came into the eyes of Prudence. Regina noticed her steady gaze, and, going to the dress- ing-table, looked into the mirror. "Ah!" That monosyllable was all she'uttered; but neither of them ever alluded to the fatal mark again. "You can clear these things away," she said,: pointing to the couch of furs; "I shall need them no more. To-night, you shall go to the theatre with me. I wish to speak to Mr. Irwin, the manager." Prudence hesitated. "Well, what is the matter with you?" "Are. you thinking of going'on the stage again, my dear?" "Yes." "In England?" "YesB." "May I tell you something that has bappen- ed iere in London? It may make a difference in your plan." If yon wish." "shall have to mention a name-" "No, don't do that!" said Rgioa, turning quickly away. I cannot bear it just ye,  I shall know who you mean without it." "Well, then, my dear, you remember-that ,is, when he left us that evening, he went straight to Charlemount House."' "There must have been a scene worth wit- nessing!" said the actress, bitterly. How did :it end?" '       "   .. " "In a duel!" "Where?" "There-in the house9' "Prudence, it could not be l "I repeat it. He forced it upon the earl, it is even said. that he struck him;" "'nd then--" "They fired ovJr the dinner-table."    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6470-00000041"/> Regina's lips blanched, and she steadied her- self by a ebair. "So near! And what of him?" "He is safe!" exclaimed Prudence, terrified by her ghastly look. "The earl fired in the air!" "The brave fellow!" "But Clif-"' '*Stop l" she eried, shuddering all over at the half-uttered name.  "I did not mean it, indeed, Regina-I for- got. He shot the earl through the right lung." ' Is the earl dead?" "No." "Or going to die?" "No; he is able to ride out in a close car- riage." * Thank Heaven for that! But where is he?" "In France, or somewhere else abroad., T- e earl helped him to escape. 'I suppose he will be coming back again now, since his lordship has been pronounced quite out of danger for the last four or five days." Regina walked to the window, and stood leaning her head upon it, and looking out into the garden. By-and-by, she said, in a low voive: "What did they fight about?" Pruience laid down the furs she was arrang- ing, and came to her side,  "Shall I really tell you?" Yes." "About you, Regina!" Ah I Well-go on!" "You must not be angry-" "Go on!" said Regina, stamping her foot. "Well, then, he accused the earl of having wronged you!" Did he dare to rhention my name?" "He was going to do it, but the earl stopped him. And -the earl fought as much to show ,the world that you had been slandered, as to revenge himself." "' Who gave you that piece of news?" "The earl said ao himself, and told one of his friends to say so for him in the clubs, when he was lying ill at home." "He slandered me-he accused me--he be lieved me to be the vilest of the vile, and a stranger punishes him for it!" said Regina,   musingly. "Prudenee, I should like to see the earl."  "That is very easy!" said Prudence, who, for some cause or other, seemel strangely flut- tered by the speech. "You should have sent to inquire after him as soon as you heard of this." "John went every day." "That was well. I think I shall send a note /this evening; and ask when he will be able to call on me. He is Alfred's brother, and, in spite of that miserable letter, I will see him!" "First look at this;" said Prudende, produc- ing a twist-d note from her apron-pocket. The astress tore it open, and read as follows: "REGINA : Can you forgive my past folly, and, look- ing upon me simply as the brother of a man who loved you dearly, admit me once to your presence? I pledge you my honor that I will not utter a word yeu would not wish-to hear.      CHABLEMOUNT." "When did this come?" "I-to-day." Regina looked sharply at the little old wo- man, who was stammering and turning very red under her eyes. "Who brought it?* "My lord himself." ' Where did he go then?" "Nowhere," said Prudence, in a subdued voice. "What do you mean?" ' Promise first not to be angry with me " I I know it all! You disobeyed ordae--you let him in!" "Yees." "When did he go away?" "He has not gone," was t1e rueful answer. "What! Is Lord Charlemount in this house -under the same roof with me?" "Listen, Rgins,"' said Prudence, anxious to avert the coming storm. 4'It was only an hour ago that he came ; and when I saw him so pale and weak, standing at the door, leaning on his servant's arm, I had not the heare to drive him away; so he came in. I have lit the fire in the drawing-room each afternoon, to air the place, and I took him there-only to  rest, though-for T knew you would not see i him. I went away for a little time, and when T came back, the poor gentleman was Bsound asleep in his arm-chair. His servant told me he-iad hardly closed his eyes for five nights, and I had not the heart to wake him."   "So he is sleeping there still P"' "Like a little child." Regina could not help smiling. At the same time, she felt a touch of pity at the thought of one whom she had last seen, strong, and gay, and happy, so reduced by weakness and pain, that he slept beneath her roof as tranquilly as if he had been in his own chamber. "Do not take the dressing-table away," she said. "And bring me something to putoon in the place of this dressing-gown. It must be all black-not a thread' of crimson about'it. The velvet, I thinli, is quite plain."  "You will see him?" "Yes."  Prudence vanished as if she had wings; and in a little more than a quarter of an hour, Re- gina, dreseed in what might be callied her' "i eeds"' crossed the hall and entered the drawing-room.   '  J .   .' I  i '^   , / . X \   Howe, who was keeping watch and ward over his sleeping master, started when she -opened the door, and came forward to meet her with a profound bow.

"My housekeeper will be happy to offer you some refreshment," she said, motioning him toward the' door in a way he dared, not gaio- say. And he took his departure, muttering to himself: : "Ah! imymas1tr knows well enough how to manage that poor fool of a Ruth, but this is another affair.

Ah! all in vain, these passionate tears .- The dull despairar-the heavy pain My soul must feel through future years, Will never touch his heart again! While Hif love again, with me, Another shape and form could know, Twould be no stranger sight to see Red roses brooming in the snow! M. B.   Regina moved very softly across the room,  and standing opposite the earl, looked at him with . very peculiar interest. His illhess, though'short, had been severe, and she scarce- ly recognized him. His face was very thinand very pale, and the long beard he still wore add- ed to that pallor; his temples were hollow; his eyes sunken, and his once powerful frame was stretched languidly out in the easy-chair, while his thin, white hands fell nervously, on the crimson-velvet cushions, looking still thinner and whiter from the contrast with the brilliant color. All the strength of which he had been so proud was gone; .a hectic flush stained his pale cheek, and the chesnut curls scarcely hid the blue veins distinctly traced upon temple and forehead. He looked more like a dying man than the proud Earl of Charlemount she had seen before; and what touched' her still more deeply, he looked like Alfred. Illness had brought out that expression which rude health had concealed-as we sometimes catch the familiar aspeot of a daguerreotype in the lslade,4hough we looked for it in vain while the sdn was shining brightly on the plate. Touched by this resemblance, she drew nearer, and leaning against his chair, mused, as she gazed, upon that old time which had been quite as happy as the new, and that old love which had not failed her till death inter- posed between them. , Her eyes were dim with tears, when the earl, starting suddenly from his slumber, looked up at her. For one moment he seemed puzzled and confused; a glance   around the unfamiliar room recalled everything to his mind, and he half rose from his chair.  Sit still, my lord," said Regina, going back to her old place by the fire. "I do not think you are fit to move." "Is it possible that I have been asleep?" he said, looking very much distressed. "'What must you think of me  "I am very glad you have rested so well," was her kind reply. "- You look so ill that I was quite frightened when I first came into the room. You really must not rise!". A( Pardon me, I have no right to sit here. I have not yet heard that I am forgiven for the unmanly insult-" Even as he spoke, the color fled fromn his face, and he sat down again and leaned his head upon the cushions of his chair. Regina ran into the study, and returning with a glass ot water, held it to his lips. He drank feebly; she went back, brought out a little flask of eau- de-cologne, and pouring it over her handker- chief, bathed his temples with it. The faint ness passed away, and he openedhis eyes once more, and looked up at her with a smile. 'You are very kind. Say you forgive me!" "I forgive you! Partly, because you are Alfred's brother-and partly, because I don't think you would write that letter now." "I would die first l" he murmured; and taking the hand she held out to him, he raised it to his lips. However different Regina might be from other women in many things, she had   all a woman's love of nursing and petting an. invalid'; and now she arranged the- cushions more comfortably under his head, and brought a stool for hits feet, before she sat down beside him, and prepared to listen to what he had to say. "How different all this is from what I had fancied!" he said, with a smile. ," I scarcely thought you would allow me to enter the house."                "  "To tell-the truth, I should not have, done so, only for what had happened. Prudence let you in while I was locked up in my room, and.. gave me such a pitiful account of your ap- pearance, that I could not help coming to: see you." "' I am much obliged to Prudence." "You may well be; for she sings your praises with all her heart. But I' am also obliged io her. I should have sent for you to- night. i should have sent for you before; if I had known what I now know." "Did you not hear it?" asked Charlemount, wond'eringly.  "They knew it here in the house; but for the last ten days I have been shut up in my. own room, and have not seen the face of any human being!"  A red flush stole up to Oharlemount's cheek. Well he- knew how those ten days must have been spent; and for the first time he was conscious of a wish that he had not reserved his fire.  "It has been a miserable business!" he ex- claimed. "Quite right Still, we must talk about it, if you are strong enough." "I am. And I have wished to see' you ever since that night-to tell you that Clif- ford-" "          .  "Not his name " said RPgina, putting her hand suddenly to her heart. '"It is worse ,to  me now than the bullet was to you!" She smiled as she said it ; but he saw the, pallor that spread'over her face, and noticed, for the first time, the furrow on her brow. He knew then, that so far as Regina's love was con- cerned, his deep-laid plans had' been in vain. 1 If he would' win her, he must neither ask for 1 tenderness oni her part, nor show much of it : himself--ihe mustt make her-long to revenge, 1 s-  .*         '  "9   herself' upon his rival through him --and trust to futureyears of close intimacy to do the rest. '    .  "We. will na  n nm s names'l" he said, very. gently. "' But tell me what you have heard ot our meeting?" "That he insulted you!" "Mbst deeply i" "'That he struck you '". ' - Charlemount's eye flashed. "He did t No other man could have done that, and lived I Yet H". "Yet you refused to fire at him, while you risked your-own life! My lord, I can find no .words to tell you how I admire you for ,your gallant onduet I' He smiled sadly. ' If I was gallant, as you say, do you know why "' She did not answer;  "A blow is only to be washed out by the blood of him Who gives it. That blow still burns upon my cheek-it disgraces me in my own eyes-if not in those of my friends. :Yet, I will bear it-asI have borne it-for your sake, and because that man is dear to you I' "Was!

If you know anything of this mystery, I beg you will clear it up. For, apart from all other  things, I begin to feel seriously uneasy about  Ruth. I have heard nothing of her all this time." "I can tell you of her. She is safe." "How do you know that," she asked, sus- piciously, "* if yoft were not really with her on that evening?" ** I will tell you, though possibly she would not thank me for it. Do you know that I have a brother living?" "I never heard of it." "Few people ever have heard of him, poor fellow I for he does not bear ourdfamily name." "Ah I I understand." "In spite of his being the illegitimate son of my father, we have always been fond of each other. He is much younger than myself; but since poor Alfred died, we lave been constant- ly together-nay, in some of his mad pranks, he has even borrowed my name and title.' He: did so in this case; but he promised me faith- fully that he would explain it all to Ruth be- fore he married her. We have been busy late. ly, contriving the sale of a part of the proper- ty not entailed; that is to -be my wedding-gift to him* Believe me, I sparedno pains to make him do justice to your friend, after I found that she was dear to you, and it was through me that they met and corresponded while you were abroad." "He was with you in Paris?" "Yes: and returned with me the very day you left. .-But as he was anxious to marry Ruth at once, and as privately as possible, he persuaded her to leave you. He had a vague' idea that you would oppose the match if you  knew about it, on account of his birth. Butit; was wrong and imprudent to do as he did; and I gave him a long lecture, I can assure you, when he came that night and told me of it." "You knew of the meeting, then?" '"Only after it had taken place.. Harry took! Howe with him when he came, and'he was to have accompanied Ruth the 'lext day, but I would not spare him, and -another ervaint wast sent in his stead. I should have 'ome to tell you all this that vety evening, if it had' not been for that unfortunate duel."   "Is your brother ..ke you?" "So much'so 3hat he caused all this trouble, as you know. His eyes and hair are a little darker than mine, but our features are the same. We are both like the Erlinfords." Are you sure he will marry Ruth?" "There is no fear. In the first place, he loves her, although he, did desert her. In the second place, I have made it his interest to he kind to her, by settling the property on her and her children. With his own allowance from the estate, they will get on very well. I am expecting each day to hear that the knot is tied." In spite of her knowledge of the world, Re- gina was one of the most unsuspicious crea- tures that ever lived. 'Worthless as she be- lieved human nature, in the mass, to be, she was always ready to credit its goodness in in dividual case.. If any one professed love or friendship for herself, that was not to be very easily credited; but if they seemed kind and thoughtful of another's welfare, her faith in their good intentions was absolutely unbound. ed. So it happened that it never entered her head to doubt the truth of Charlemount's lit- tle romance; and looking at him with an ad- miring glance, she said, very frankly: "My lord, I cannot tell you how much plea- sure all this gives me! If all men were like you, this world would be a better and a bright- er place to live in." "Do you think so'?" He could not meet her eyes, as he asked the playful question. The utter shameshe' felt -,the loathing he had of himself for the part he was playing, was so intense, that the terri ble pain of his wound had been nothing in comparison to it. Reckless and wicked as he had been for years, he had always held fast to a kind of honor of his own; above all, till he knew Regina, he had scorned to utter a false hood, even of the most trivial kind. How was it now with him? False friend-false lover he ,had already proved-and allt vtewi that woman who satlooking. gravely into the fine, 'as little like the bright, capricious, tealtfi  oreatur Clifford had' described her, as he himself was like that;ideal Oharlemount he kneWr-she was thinking of at that very moment., Should 'he , go on, and sink into yet lower depths,-thht he   might gain her heart?

"What of lim ," "t He has left Paris." ' Have you heard?T" "Yes. The strangest fact of the whole busi- ness is, that as soon as the shot was fired, all his anger seemed to vanish. Poor Harry could not have looked more unhappy if he had fired at me by mistake; and Harry never could have written a kinder letter than I got from him t6tday." If Regina's lips did not say, "Show that let.' ter to me," her eyes did; 'and taking it from his note-ease, he put it into her hand-it wa% very short: "MY DEAR CHARL EMOUNT Your kind, forgiving let ter reached me three days ago, aud I accepted the ap pointment at once.

"The letter dropped from her hands. 'Gone!" "I have told you too suddenly," said Charle. mount, bending over her anxiously.  "No=--no! When will he come back?" "In a year or two, I dare say." "Not before?" "No; he has joined the Tasmanian expedi  tion. When I found how miserable he was, and how determined he was not to return to En- gland, I got that appointment for- him again. The expedition ought to have started in Au- gust; but, luckily for him, it was delayed till now."         . '       '  She sat looking at him as if she had been', turned into stone.

"I know that he would.

" Regina mused a long time. At last she raied her-hand, -looked at it a moment, and laid it in the earl's. He raised it to his lips, and then taking a diamond from his own finger, he placed itabove h's brother's ring. "Not a word, now " she whispered. '"Go * -and when I can, I will send for you!" She rang the bell beside her chair, and Howe appeared at the door. Leaning on his arm, the earl went slowly out of the room, his heart beating so with the sudden joy that he could scarcely walk. Regina, left alone, looked first at her black dress and then at the gem, with a melancholy smile. *   5-   *   *   *   W There is no mission on earth so painful, and at the same time so awkward, as that of t breaking" things to people. It is a useless piece of mercy, moreover, for the very air and manner of the messenger shows that he has bad news in store, -before there has been time for him to open his lips;, andthe diplomacy with -which he manages to delay the precise in- formation for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour-though exercised with the kindest in- tentions-resembles, in no slight degree, the proceedings of a camp of Indian, who lIaving doomed some captive chief to the stake, 4pply a torh now and then to his naked limbs, by way of foretaste of the wholesale roaeting about to be endured and enjoyed by the differ- ent parties. Oharlemount was, possibly, too blunt and honest for this kind of work. He knew, when he knocked at Mr. Erlinford's door, one lovely autumn morning, that hi was about to give great pain to one who was dear to him as a-sis- ter he hatedithe task, and yet, because no-ne could perform it but himelf, he set about it with a kind of dogged kindness, very muoh a a tenderhearted surgeon-there are suehan-t omalies existing--mputates a limb for some   poor, shrieking woman in a hospital ward. Crossing the hall, he entered the morning-room unannounced, and found Mrs. Erlinford, who hadbeen seriously ill, propped up by pillows in an easy-chair, and just making the tour of the apartment, under the. footman's guidahne, be- fore she was wheeled away too her own bed- room, which was on the, same floor. "My dear George," she said, holding out her hand, "I am delighted to see you. But how dreadfully pale your are looking. You are not fit to be out, I am sure."  * "Oh, I am getting on famously now. But are you better?" "A great deal, I think. I am to leave town next week. Fancy our being cooped up in London at-this time of the year?" For my part, I like it exceedingly. I made the discovery several years ago, that, London is never so pleasant a place to live in as when everybody is out of town. Since I have been well enough to drive about, I have found no cause for complaint. But you-with that low fever hanging about you, the noise and. the  close air must be disagreeable in the ex- treme." "Oh, the street has been kept very still, thanks to Edwards and the policeman. As for the air, I confess I shall not object to exchange it for that of Erlinford Hall. Helen looks like a ghost already. I tried to make her go down with my brother's family two weeks ago, but she would not hear of it, and she has watched beside me night and day, though there was no real need of it, till she has worn herself to a perfect shadow." "She is the kindest and bestBf human beings!" said Charlemount, musingly. And I want very much to say ten words to her. Where is she?" "In my room, I believe. She went there to fill the vases with fresh flowers. Shall I send, her to you?" -  "Are you going? .Do you not sit up longer than this?"  "Three hours rt a timer That is all the doctor will allow just yet. But next week I shall make, amendsfor it. I wish you would go down with us, George."     "I-1. dcn't think-I cannot leave town just yet," said Charlemount, turning very red.         t  '   Mrs. Erlinford looked at him keenly, and draw. ing him nearer, -whispered, so that the footman, who had retired to the window, need not;hear, "George, do you mind telling me if your-duel was really about her?"  And she nodded her head, mysteriously, in the direction of Brompton, as she thought,- but really toward Charing Cross and WestminA ster Bridge. "About Regina?" said Charlemount, in a low tone. "It certainly was I 1 Lady Castlebarnet told me so'; but I would not believe it. How could you, my dear George-"  "My dear Mrs. Erlinford," was the grave re- -ply, " what was I to do.? Clifford wa -in the wrong-he admits it now; but, at the time, he insulted her most 'grossly, and I defended her." "But you did not know her!' "No; I only knew that she was a woman, and that she was accused of an imprudenceshe had never been guilty of-that she was belied -and so I fought!" ".My dear George, that sentiment would bring down the gallery, if you were on the stage of a theatre over the water," said Mrs. Erlinford, with a sneer.  No doubt. I dare say the members of the gallery would do the same thing themselves if they had the, opportunity. An Englishman, whether he happens to be a city shop-boy or a peer of the realm, is not very apt to allow any woman to be wronged, if he can help it!" "Better and better!" said Mrs. Erlinford, applauding gently. "You positively must go upon the boards.! You are a knight of old H- you are a Don Quixotte, without the rusty ar- mor or the sorry nag! So kind of you to take up the fair damsel's quarrel-without the hope ,of the slightest reward, or even of 'any ac- knowledgment, it may be, from the lady her- self!" A ray of light flashed in upon the mind of 'the bewildered earl at the close of this speech. His cousin was angry-not so much beeausehe; had fought, as becwle she. fancied Regina had managed: to wound. her gallant knight e*en more deeply than his opponent had done. HRe Oould not help smiting:,at the thought, but ihe 9owed low before her to hidethat smile.:  "You are cruel," he said, 4"When I fight  v   again, I shall do my best to keepyouii  ig ior- ance of it."-      .  "Doo eo, by all mpans--specially when you i see fit to fight in such a cause!"- "What can have ehauged yousoe? I have heard you say- often that you believed Regina to be a thorough good woman!" "It is ,a womans: privilege to alter her mind!" aid Mrs. Erlinford,sharply. "Ten times a minute, if she likes.'" "Very well 1 I have used my privilege-. that is all!"' 1" ' But you wrong Regina by doing so!" "Possibly!" "There is nothing she values like her good name!" "She should take better care of it, then "' "But, mydear cousin, consider for a mo- ment. If -Clifford chose to invent or imagine, anything wrong about her, and proclaim it to all London, is that a reason why all London should at once believe it?" '"Was he not engaged to her?". "Why-yes!" "And he was very fond of her "'. "I suppose so-after a fashion of his own." "It was a fashion that-was going to make him marry her, at all events!"  "Yes "  "Then is it likely that he would invent any- thing for the sake of getting rid of a woman whom he adored?"P , "But, my dear friend, he says himself now that he does not believe it.' - "To whom?" "To me I I have the letter at home-l will go and-bring it to you."     .  In his eagerness, he was about to rush from the room, btutfshe detained him.  ' Don't go, George.

"Babh!" said. Mrs. Erlinford, waving. her    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6470-00000045"/> band. - "Thinkl of women as. you please,. and of Regina as you please; we will not quarrel over her. I must- ran away and leave' you now. Shall I send Helen?" "Yet," said the earl, rather sulkily. "You are vexed with me, but some day you  will see that I was right. I only wish to, open your eyes in time, and to keep you, if possi- hle, from entangling yourself, as that unfortu- nate Clifford-" 4"Pray, do not speak of him" "'  "Poor fellow  Well, there, don't look so vexed, my dear George.. Good-bye and do  try and go down to Erlinford Hall with us. I  shall tell Helen to ask you, and I do not think you will refuse her, your gallantry will forbid." Summoning Edward from the obseurtty of the window-acrtains, she waved an adieu to her cousin with a mischievous smile. Charle- mount held the door open,. and bowed pro- - foundly as it closed upon the wheeled chair and its occupant; but he would not speak, and, until he had taken one or two quick turns through the rooms,. and relieved his feelings by uttering a very naughty word in the ambush of his beard, he could not trust himself. to meet Helen, or to tell her in a proper manner what he had come expressly to say. It was not long before she entered, followed by an old French governess, who posted herself in the most distant corner of the room, and prepared to " play propriety," by fixing her eyes intent- ly on some nondescript embroidery she held in her hand. Helen' went up and greeted Charlemount with a smile; but it soon faded away, and lefther gazing at him with anxious eyes. Her mother was right. She was, indeed,. but the, shadow' of her, former self; and yet, pale and sad as was the young face, it was even more beautiful than before. As Regina needed s ine strong emotion-anger, or love; or hatred -to develop her peculiar style of beauty, so Helen Erhnford only gained an added charm from the pensive melancholy that paled the rose-tint on her cheek, and gave a dreamy soft- ness toher deep-blue eyes. They both suffer- ed from the same cause; but one built up an iron rampart about her grief, and hid herself from all eyes behind it, if a sudden pang of memory came on, while the other let thatgrief pervade her heart, andi soul, and nature, ike a   Silent lHke, into -whose. dim recesses hshe .gazed with tearful eyes, and on whose .borders grew the pale flowers of resignation, meekness, and gentle endurance.  -      . Charlemount wished himself a thousand miles away:'as those blue eyes looked steadily into hi own.  .       '  - "Do you know what I have come to say, Helen?" he asked. "Do you know what has happened lately?": '  Mamma told me, just as she was taken ill, that you and-that you had fought a duel, George!"  .' .         .  "It was quite true I You know with whom?" "Yes, now! But I did not at first." "Were you .agry with me?"  -   No. .,  "' I would not have fought if I could have helped it. But he struck ine' , "I am glad neither of you were killed!" she said, thoughtfully. "Yes-it was a narrow chance I We fired over the table!" Helen shuddered. "But you have heard all this before I One thing, however, you may not know-very few do know it for a certainty. Where do you think Mr. Clifford is?" 'He asked the question in an off-hand, care- less way, as if he had been speaking of an or- dinary acquaintance, and did not' look at her aa he uttered the name. There was a short si- lence. Then she answered, quietly: "In France, I believe 1i "He was till last week. But now he has gone away." .      ' "Where?" '  "'To Tasmania l" "With the expedition?" "Yes!"  s When will he return?" "I do not know  Prom what he says, I fancy it will be many years. You must know that we made up our quarrel -at once, and I had the pleasure of getting his appointment for him L He i a fine fellow, after all; and I never had a friend I could have loved better, if he would have let me." Helen did nob answer. She sat leaning her head upon her hand, gazing steadily at the ear- t pet, with her face turned slightly away from \   him. A German band in the square was play- ing the air of"Love not.' The windows were open, and every note fell upon her ear with sickening distinctness. In after years, when she was once more happy and at rest, the sound of that melody never failed 'to bring ba* a mo- mentary recurrence of the pang with which she listened to it then   .  Charlemount, seeing her so unmoved out- wardly, congratulated; himself on the clever manner in which he. had broken the news to her. Here would be" no closed doors for ten days-here no tabooihg a name-here no tragiw scenes, at the Brompton Cottage I However deeply Helen might' have allowed her feelings to be entangled, she was an English girl-.-both too proud to show what she suffered, and too "plucky " to pine and waste away any longer for a man who efidentlydid' not care three straws for her.

"You must give her time." "She takes it of -herself. What will you think when I say that I have never spoken to her since the day we were engaged-and that, by the way, was the day of our first meet- ing!" Helen looked quite amazed. " ow long ago was that, George?" "A week." * Have you tried to see. her?" I have been out there every day, but could only get the answer from Prudence that her mistress was not yet well enough to receive visitors. There she is, ill in bed, for aught I know, and I am fretting myself into a shadow, without the slight st hope of being allowed to comfort or care for her. It is enough to drive one mad!" "Have you written?" "Every day, also-quires of note-paper. I never wanted to touch a pen before; but now it is seldom out of my hand. And I don't be. lieve she reads one of those not3s-I don't, in- deed." Helen could not help smiling at his despair- ing look and tone.  I dare say she keeps them 11 under her pillow, George!" "Very little you know of her if you imagine that! Look t After begging and praying for an answer for seven days, that is what I got!" He took a tiny note from his breast-pocket, and thrust it into her hands. It ran thus: "MT DEAR CtIARLEMOUNT: I am really not well enough to see you, but be patient, and I will send you a message as early as possible. Thank you very much for the books and flowers you have sent. "REGINA." "Is this all?" asked Helen. All? Yes; and I dare say she thought she had done something wonderful in writing it. By Heaven I Tom Moore was very right." nd he quoted: , ' Yes-loving is a painful thrill, And not to love more painful still; But, oh, it is -he worst of pain, To live and not be loved again!' Do you know," he continued, "I always used to imagine that was only written to fill up a page, or a verse; but I have caught myself saying it a thousand times this week. Do you think she will ever love me, Helen?"   "I am sure she will, Charlemount. You are too good not to be loved." "You think so; but you are a partial judge," said the earl, turning confusedly laway. "I am glad I am not ' good'; but that does not mat. ter. A all events, she will be mine; and, when she sees how fond I am of her, she will treat me differently."  "' Here is your note, George." He looked at it half-angrily, half-fondly, as he folded it up and put it away. ' The worst of it is, Helen, that I am always remembering Clifford, and how differently she felt toward him." "Was she fond of him?" "If you saw her, now that he has left her, you would not ask." ," Is she ill?" '"For ten days she never left her room, and I dare say she has shut herself up again now. She looks like a ghost. It is-exceedingly plea-  sant for me.' "George," said Helen, laying her hand light. ly on his, " will you take my advice?" "Let nme hear it first." ' Break off this marriage!"  "Are you mad?" he added, impatiently. "You might as Well ask me to break my neck! It would amount to the same thing in the end!" "You will never be happy with Regina!" ' Why not?" "Has she ever said she loved you?" "No. She never will say it, till it is true I But I thought you were pleased with the plan. Only a moment ago you said you were sure she would learn in! time." "' What you have just told me alters the case. Regina is not a woman to forget; and if she' was so very fond of him, you can never take 'his place. I really believe she is only about ti marry you out of pique!" "You have guessed it. The only way I could get her to consent was, by showing her how wretched she could make. Clifford." *"Do you really think he would care ", "Care? Why, Helen, though he is too proud to say it, he loves her still; 'and, I be- lieve, in my heart, he fancies she will be-true to1 him, and that all will go right when he comes back again. As if Regina was a woman   so 4anee attendance on any one who has offend- ed ter in such a way."' Helen sighed, and said no more. One of those Impish thoughts, which come so often to frail mortals, in the disguise of'"good motives," crossed her mind. If, indeed, this was so, and Clifford returned to Regina, what hope was left for her? On the otherhand, Regina could not well be miserable with the earl. 'Why should she interfere, or try to place a happiness he longed so for entirely out of his reach? '"You see," he continued, " that I do not de- ceive myself in the least. But she does not absolutely hate me; indeed, she has rather a kindness tor me, on-aceount of some one she used to know, who is now dead. Add to this, that she loves luxury, and rank, and wealth, and power. Ican lay them all at-her feet. She is proud-as proud as Lucifer before his fall; and I can help her to revenge herself on one who has slighted her. -Is not that a sufficient foundation to build some hopes of happiness on, my little sister?" "I should be sorry to build my own on such a very slight one," said Helen, frankly. Charlemount sighed. "Well, you have found but by this time, I dare say, that one cannot have everything one wants in this world. I learned the lesson while you were in your pinafores, and I learned it so well, that I am inclined to be satisfied-that is, I should be, if she would, but try to' get over this foolish fnay. I know she could do it if she tried; but you women positively seem to enjoy being miserable, and you keep the arrow rankling in the wound, long after we should E have pulled it out by main torce, and washed away all traces of the hit."  Helen raised her blue eyes to his. "Ah, Charlemount," she said, very softly, "it may not be the will that is wanting with us, but the strength." He looked at her, half-startled into a convic- tion that she was suffering more than he had thought, after all. But, intimate as they were, he dared not trench upon this forbidden; ground  "There was something else I wanted to ask you," he said, after a slight pnaue.  "What was it?" "As soon as I see Regina I shall urge her to   'marry me at once. There is no use in waiing. And I owu frankly that I shall n ever -know 6 moment's peace till Ican call her Countess of Charlempunt. The marriage will be a very quiet affair. And' how long are you going to stay in town?" "I think till the last of next week." . Charlemount fidgeted with his glove, and seemed to find great difficulty in what he was about to say. "I wonder if your mother would consect to come to the church, Helen?" "I am afraid not." "It is strange what has prejudiced her so against. Regina. 'There was a time when she would have actually gone to Brompton and called upon her, if Clifford would have promised her a welcome.", "I know." "Well, what has Regina done since-? As for her believing that stupid story, it is all non- sense-no one believes it. What is the matter with her?"  Helen looked-rather confused at this very straight-forward question, but finally concluded that frankness was the best policy under ail circumstances. "Shall I tell you what I think Regina's crime is?" "By all means"  ' She is to be the Coontesa of Charle mount!"      ,  "Well, what 'has your mother to do with that?" "Not much, I confess," He looked at her in utter perplexity .but, a somewhat mischievous smile trembling round i her lips, enlightened him by degrees . "You don't mean toay, my dear girl, that she wanted me to marry you?'  "You ask point-blank questions, my lord." "I give you py *ordl I never thought of the thing before,' he aid,so nazely,that she could not help laughing. "'If it had been- in any other place, I should have been on my guard.

But it seems odd to me that no one ever knew, except Tom Grosvernor, what bird I was really trying to cage." "I knew, long ago!" "Then a wonderful thing has happened, and a woman has kept a secret at last! There, don't look angry, my dear Helen. I am in a worse plight than ever. If Mrs. Erlinford re- fuses to come to the church, what shall I do?" "Where is Ruth?'; "Ruth-eh? Oh, I don't know, I am sure," was the confused reply. "In the country, I suppose. Why do you ask ' "I She could accompany Regina." "Oh, it is not exactly that, I want some of my own family to countenance the marriage. I could not ask you, but I thought your mother would not object. I wish, with all my heart, that I knew a manufactory for dowager aunts --I would order one at once."  "When is. it to be?" "At any time she names I To-morrow, if she likes!" "But the settlements?' "They are all ready." "In a week?" "We have been about them a longer time than that; and even lawyers can be driven fast when their road is paved with gold!" was the evasive reply. "Would you like me to ask mamma if she would go?" said Helen. "It may make a difference when she learns you are really going to be married at once." ," Well, there is no harm in trying. Yes, go -but pray do not be long." Helen left the room-the nodding governess remained to keep him company. Mrs. Erlin- ford was dozing in her chair when she entered the sick-room, but roused herself at once, and turned a glange of the keenest interest upon her daughter's flushed and agitated face. "Well, Helen, what do you wish for?" "Charlemount sent me, mamma." "Indeed I What for?" "To ask you a question." "Very well, why do you not ask it, then?" "Because, mamma," said Helen, bending over her chair, "I must first tell you some   wonderful news."  "About him p?"  "Yes."  "Is he going to settle down at last, and mar- ry?"      . .   .  '   . "He is, indeed?" Mrs. Erlinford grasped her daughter's hand convulsively. "Is it you, HelVn? Has he asked you?" "No, mamma." She could not add more, for the lady threw herself back in her chair, and went into violent hysterics, from which it took a quarter of an hour, two ladies'-maids, and a huge bottle of sal volatile, to recover her. When she opened her eyes once more, they fell on Helen, who was rubbing her hands. .. "Ungrateful, disobedient girl!" she exclaim- ed, tragically. "Pray, mamma!-the servants are here!" said Helen, in a whisper. Mrs. Erlinford snatched away her hand, and ordered the ladies'-maids (who were already pricking up their ears) to leave the room "Now tell me more about this horrible busi- ness," she said, angrily. "I always knew it whuld end like this! If you had been like other girls, you might have been Countess of Charlemount to-day! But you never would make any use of your opportunities-and now, I. suppose, that pale-faced Lady Blanche Marsdale-" "It is not Lady Blanche, mamma." "Who, then?- "Regina!" "What " exclaimed Mrs. Erlinford, sitting bolt upright in her chair. "Has he been talking to you of her?" "Yes, mamma." "But he never was insane enough to tell you that he was going to marry her?" "Indeed he did, mamma!"  L   And what did he send you to me for, pray?" "You know that her friend Ruth has gone away?" Yes-do be quick, child!" "Well, Regina has no female friends in Lon- don, and George thought that perhaps you g would not mind being at the church when they e were married."    Mrs. Erlifford sat perfectly dumb with aston ishment and indignation. But Helen, taking her silence for consent, went on with her story. "  Hewill think it so very kind of you. He says he could not ask me-" "Oh, he did say that, did he?" "Yeas-but may I tell him that you will con- sent?" "If I go to see George Erlinkrd marry a stage actress, who is no better than she should be-who-go to your room directly, Helen, and stay there till I send for you'!" . "To my room  directly Why, mamma, George is waiting for your answer I What can you mean?" "Where is your father?', "Out-I don't know where." "If he was at homee he should turn George out of the house at once." "Mammal" "To think that he should insult you by talk. ing about that woman, who "hot fit to be named before any young girl " "Mamma! you cannot really believe those things against her 1" "What bhings? What do you know about them? I dare say he has been telling you. about them, too! Miss Erlinford, I am ashamed of you!" A deep flush burned on Helen's cheek, but she did not answer. "And to think that he insults me-me, the wife of his cousin, and an Erlinford in my own right-by this vile proposal I Upon my word, I believe his head is turned-he -cannot be in his right senses." "I do not see why you say so."  "No doubt you are delighted with the idea of this match-are you not?" "I think it wili make him happy, in time." "Not at once? ' "Scarcely, mamma; for Regina has not yet forgotten Clifford." "Bah!" exclaimed Mrs. Eriinford. "What do you suppose she cared for Clifford, when this chance of becoming a countess was within her reach? I have no doubt it was all a eon- trived plan on her part; and as for pooe Charlemount, Bedlam is the only proper placr for him, just at present." "Then I shall tell him you refuse?"   "You will tell him nothing. Ring the bell, and give me that writing-desk. ' Helen obeyed. 4 note was rapidly penned, and given by Mrs. Erlinford to the servant. She turned to her daughter as the door closed behind him. "I request that you will not mention deorge's name again to me till I give you leave." "Am I not to see him again?" asked Helen, in dismay. "Certainly not! I do not think he will. trouble us any more at present. Now, go to your room, and try and get rid of that milk- maid flush upon your cheeks." The note was duly presented to Charlemount, who was playing the devil's tattoo on the win- dow-ledge, and wondering what could keep Helen away so long. He tore it open, and read' as follows: "My LORD: I beg to decline the very creditable in vitation you have thought proper to send me by my daughter; and to request you (in the absence of Mr. Erlinford) to leave the house immediately. All inter  course between us must be suspended for the present. "ANNA EutINFORDD Charlemount stared at the note a moment, and then, breaking into a low laugh, stuffed it into his pocket, and took up his hat and gloves.  "It's a very fine thing to be mother-in-law To a very magnificent three-tailed bashw!" he hummed, as he crossed the hall. "Tell your mistress that her commands shall be obeyed," he said to the servant who opened the door for him; and, with a small sigh for  poor Helen, he went down the steps. A groom, coming up the square at a sharp trot, checked his horse on seeing him, sprang to the ground, and touched his hat. "' Beg pardon for following you, my lord," he said. "They told me you were here." "Where have you come from?" "Brompton, my lord." "Any note-any message." The groom produced a note*from his breast. pocket.  Charlemount snatched it from his hand, and read the welcome words: "MY DEAR CHARLEMOUNT: I am better now; if you like to come out, I will see you. BERZGIWa, "Bravo! this makes amends for all!" be exclaimed; and then, looking at the groom,    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6470-00000048"/> added: "My good fellow, give me your horse, and go to Charlemount House, and tell them to bring the brougham out to the Cottage. You can come by that." "Very well, my lord," said the man, grin-    ning delightedly at the guinea Charieamount tossed toward him for hoding the stirrup, And the gallant gagy dashed off like the wind, bearing this ardent lover to his lady's feet.

Nay-not a quiet, but a lonely heart; Both swept and garnished, but unfilled of latob From all love's faptasies it stands apart, Too strong to murmur, and too tired to hate  Weary of life?

Regina sat alone in the study, reading. The room had returned to its old aspect. She her- self was most carefully, though simply-dressed, and as calm and quiet in look and manner as if notling beyond the most common events of ordinary life had occurred to her. Prince 'Charlie's white head peeped out from the folds of her black dress, and the gray cat, perched upon her knee, 'purred loudly and sleepily as she stared into the fire. 'Peter, with his head on one side, was shuffling across the floor,.to hide a small gold pencil which had fallen from her hand; all was still but for his subdued croaking, the low twitter of the ca- naries, and the dropping of a coal now and then from the grate. There was only one change in the apartmevt-the picture of Lord Erlinford had been Drought from its conceal- tnent, and stood on its easel near the window. It. faced Regina as she glanced now and then from the pages of her book; but her eyes never iAngered long upon it. She could not yet quite bear the strong resemblance it bore to him: who had wronged and deserted her. Her book was a pleasant one, and she had, evidently, taught herself to forget, in order to enjoy-- for she smiled now and then as she chanced upon a witty passage. The quick, sharp gallop of a horse on the lawn made her slose'the volume; but she didnot lay it aside --she leaned her, head upon her hand, and' stroked the glossy sides of the cat' as she lis. tened to the arrival. The voice of Prudence was heard in the hall-then- came another, I.   deeper, and more eager in its tones, and hasty feet traversed the stone floor. No color came to her cheek. She said, "Come in," very quietly, when Prudence. knocked at the door and held out her hand, with a faint smile, as Charlemount entered. "At last," he said, raising her hand to his lips. "How could you keep me from you so long               . "I have not been well, my lord. Will you take a seat? You see I cannot move. Dick and Prince Charlie hold me a prisoner between them." Setting the painful part of an unreturned love quite aside, there is something intensely ludicrous in'its aspect to an unconcerned spec- tator. One of the parties is so eager, so ar- dent, so devoted-the other so quiet, so cour- teous, and so cold ; and the two moods con- trast so oddly just when they ought to mingle most pleasantly, that. they will repay the closest amount of study lavished upon them by an observer of human nature in all its creduli- ties. If. unfortunately, you happen to be one of those parties yourself, it is by no means so funny a proceeding. If you ever have bee'n one (and who among us has not?),' you 1will call up a like sympathy, in the midst of your smiles, for this poor fellow, whose greatest fault seems to be one usually ascribed to a more impressible sex--the loving "not wisel, but too welf." One misery, however, was spared him ;-though-i he was ignorant of the mercy.  A' w(oman generally revenges herself for the attlsehood of *     <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6470-00000049"/> one lover by tormenting the next; and, I really believe, many a poor creature endures a con- tinual martyrdom even now, by way of ex- piating, unconsciously, the sins of some one, Dick or Harry, of whose name or existence he is utterly ignorant, but who, in earlier days, has trifled with the young affections of Miss Brown, Smith, or Jones, as the ease may be. From this pleasant little foible, Regina, in this one instance, was free. It may be that she re- garded. Charlemount somewhat as a well-fed mouser looks upon the hundredth victim es- caping from her talons after the ninety-nine have been slaughtered; but, at all events, she refrained from tormenting him in any delibe- rate and studied way; and my fair readers will agree with me in saying that this tells very much in her favor. " Have you been very ill?" asked Charle- mount, glancing anxiously at her wasted figure, and the slight hollows in her cheeks. "A slow fever-that is all," she replied, without looking at him. "I was up most of the time; but one feels cross, and pettish, and nervous through an illness of that kind, and I would not inflict, myself upon you." "*I would have watched over you most gladly, Regina!" "No doubt," and she smiled slightly; "but Prudence did very well, and her attendance was much more in accordance with the laws of propriety than yours. would have been. I en- joyed your books, and fruit, and flowers, though, very much indeed I It was very kind of you to send them." "They were yours, not mine," he murmur- ed. "Have you forgotten that everything I have-" "No," she said waving her hand, as if to check, him. He caught sight of her finger-his brother's ring was there, but where was the diamond? "Why did you take it off?" he said, turning very pale.    .  . ' Whlat?" "Th-- ring-myn rog' . ,..  "Oh. I only laid it aside, because it was so heavy ;it quite weighed my hand down," He looked very gloomy. "And another thing-7it was too large. If   you will be kind enough to bring it from my writing-desk, I will show you.".  "*He rose and looked for it. He almost groaned when he saw that it had been flung carelessly down among a quantity of note- paper and envelopes, as if it mattered little what became of it. When we love, as Charle. mount loved, these little briars, that are for- ever growing about the roses we would gather, can sting us to the very heart of hearts I Regina took the ring from his hand, placed it on her own, and held it up. It slid from the lintlewasted finger into her lap." "You see?" "Yes,.I see." , He put the jewel in his pocket, and took her hand; it looked so small, lying in his own, with the wedding-ring shiping upon it like a star. "I will bring you an another, Can I have this for a measure?" She shrank back when he laid his finger upon Alfred's gift, as if he had touched a quivering nerve. "That   Certainly not! It will never leave my hand--it will be buried with me when I die!" He tarned, and looked'a. moment at the bright, beautiful face of his dead brother. His lip quivered-he passed his hand hurriedly across his eyes-then sank on his knees beside her chair, laid,his head upon. its carved arm, and burst into tears.  ,  "What shall 1 do to make you, loye me?" he said, through his sobs. "I would die for you, and you do not care for mel J Iam afraid, sometimes, taat you never will!"  Regina looked amazed at first, Opt his ,evi- dent misery touched .her; at last.. ,IN ont dreaded what people call "a scene more. than she did; no one was more uncomfortable at seeing suffering and tears. But there. was something in the earl's grief that softened her. It was not the gay man of the world trying to win her by a false show of sentiment; it was more like an honest, romantic sehoolboy, sob- bing his heart out over his first; mishap, and seeking corfort from the very hand that wound- ed. him. It was a thing which ,Cliffird would never have donl. He had knelt, in the lame way, it is true, and given her one:tear as le   kissed her hand. Charlemount gave many, without daring- to touch her fingers with his lips. Tired out, wearied, and blase though he might be about many things, this was the first real true and pure love he had ever felt, and it made him fresher-hearted than the young author, and far more simple and unstudied in the man ifestations of his affection. She knew this welli and, in spite of herself, the frank' outhurst of tenderness soothed her inexpres si- bly. She put away the dozing eat, and bend- ing over him, laid both her hands lightly upon' "s head. "My dear Charlemount, you make me very sad!" "Do I?  Then I will not shed another tear!'  "I hardly know why these were shed." 'Because you were so cold, Regina," he murmured, in a low voice. "I did not intend to be." ' No; that is just the worst of it If you did intend it, I think it would not be half so hard to bear!" She was silent for a little time. At last, she said: "Look up, Charlemount." He obeyed, showing a flushed and tear- stained face, quivering lips, and the saddest of eyes. "Poor fellow!" she said, very gently; and brushing the chesnut hair away from his fore- head, she laid her lips upon it. "There, let that make amends for all." He looked up at her with that eager, half- doubtful glance which an animal puts on after having been punished and forgiven, and which is the most touching thing on earth. "Oh, Regina, do you love me? You kissed me as if you did!" "I think I shall, presently," she said, half- playfully, if you go on like this.' You are very different from the Chariemount I had im- agined. AHow have you managed" to keep- all this sensitive feeling, through such a life as yours has been?" "I never knew I had kept it--or even that I ever had it, till nw." -  "Then you have never really loved be- fore?" 7   4 I kcew it, Regina, when I first looked at you." "Flatterer "             ' "You know, very well, that it is not flat- tery."  "Very well; it shall pass for truth, if you like. But now, if I have healed the wound I unintentionally made, come and sit here by me, and we will talk soberly of our future.", He refused the chair she pushed toward him, but possessed himself of Prince Charlie's otto- man, much to the displeasure of that small' sprig of royalty, and sat down at Regina's' feet. "'Let me speak first," he cried.' "Before you make'any plans, listen to mine." "What are they?" "You are to marry me at once, and go abroad-to Italy, or wherever you choose." "It is simply impossible!" "Why?" "In the first place, I have been thinking of going on the stage again." The earl uttered an exclamation of dismay. "Only for a little time.' You must not," Regina. "In the second place, I wish to go and visit Ruth." He started, but controlled himself before she noticed his agitation.  "Very well. Go with me." "In the third place, I want another tour. All this - this -confusion has shaken my nerves terribly; and I must have quiet for a time, and little society-together with'fresh air, and pleasure enough to amuse, without ex- citing me,." "All these stings, I trust, you could have if you took me, instead of Ruth, for a companion. You forget that she will be in the middle of the honeymoon a ud will only have eyes and ears for my,brother Harry."    \ "I intend going alone." "You will be ill and lonely if you do. What is your great objection to my company?', "You eann'ot very well be here andwith me at the same time. You will have to see about settlements, and h thousand other things. -By the time you are through with them, I shall be back again."        - Everything of thht kind is ready!"    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6470-00000050"/> "In a week?"  "Yes 1" "You have a most expeditious lawyer." "May I bring him here to-day?" "For what?" "The settlements can be signed, a, special licence can be procured, and we can be mar- ried to-morrow, if you like!" "I don't like, my lord!" "But do listen to reason, Regina." " How can I? There is no one here to talk 'reason!" "Ah you are laughing I You will consent -I know you will!" "Not exactly. But if you are bent upon doing this very foolish thing, the sooner it is over the better, I suppose, So I will give up the trip." "And to-morrow?" "To-morrow you will stay quietly at home, Charlemount. On this day week, you may use the special license, if you choose." "A whole week " t he said, so discontentedly that she could not help laughing. "If you grumble, I will immediately add five to it. Now, listen I must hear from Ruthbe- fore I leave town. I must know that she is well and happy. I feel unaccountably anxious about her. I have a presentiment, and my pre- sentiments are always true l" "You need have none about her." "You must go and see her." "I?" "Yes! Why not?" "Oh, I will go if you like." "You see, I cannot make up my mind that this half-brother of yours will do her, justice. He has not treated her well. If he loved her as she loves him, he never could have done what he has. Are you sure he will marry her?" "Have T not told you so?" replied Obarle- mnount, shading his face from the fire: with a' little wrought screen. "I have done all thatI  can to bring it about." "Not quite. You might go and sea for yourself that the ceremony was properly per- formed. If anything happened to Ruth, I should never forgive myself or you-remem- ber that! And, like most women, she is so idiotic in an affair of this kind, that she will   believe every word he tells her, and do every- thing hessks. It was a foolish thing, her going i away in, that fashion."  "Why did you not stop her?" he asked, in- distinctly. "Ruth is her own mistress. I had no right to interfere." "But you were so intimate!" "The closest intimacy could give no right to meddle in her affairs. She is not a child!" "Write to her. I have no doubt she will tell you everything, Women always like to chatter about their own weddings." "Himph'! I think you will discover an ex. ception to that rule next week," was Regina's reply. But she regretted it when she saw how it seemed to pain him. "Will you go, my dear Charlemount?" "Yes." "Give the bride away?" "Yes." "And congratulate her mostgheartilyfor me Slie promised me a visit before-," Regina paused, and a bitter pang wrung her heart, as she remembered when and how that visit was to have been made. "Well?" said Charlemount, looking up. "She will not come now. It does not mat ter. We must contrive to meet on the Conti- nent. Do you think her brother will take her there?" "There is not the slightest doubt of it.'- "We will make an appointment, then, for Rome, in time for the Carnival." "Very well. I. will tell her so." You are to bring me a letter from her." * "A letter?" "Well, a note, then, if you think the first demand is unreasonable. One word I must ,have from her on her wedding-day; and till I get it, even you will not be able. to persuade me that she is-welland happy." 'Charlemount played idly with the handle of thescreen, as he listened; but his heart sank within him at this new demand. Till now, the whole thing had seemed easy; but it might be -difficult to obtain such a note. from Ruth. A ceremony must first take place, and he must bear hip part in it. It was not to be. thought of for a single moment. And yet he stood   upon the edge of a giddy precipice. -One false step, and he would plunge down an abyss from which there could be no rising again - Regina unconsciously lifted a heavy load of doubt and fear from his heart by her next remark. "It is an odd thought that this note will be the first bit of my good Ruth's handwriting I have ever seen." "What can you mean?" "Why do you look as startled as if I had told you of a newly-committed murder? The thing is simple enough, after you understand it. Of course, we did not correspond before we met. We have been together night and day ever since, till now, and this first absence of hers is so peculiar a one, that we have ex- changed no letters." "But her books-they must have been writ- ten in." "She brought none. I ran away with her one night from the theatre, and never would let her go after her goods and chattels in the city. I alway had our lists and bills to make out, Wiie we were. traveling. Indeed, I never remember seeing a pencil or pen in her hand, If she seems to think I demand too much of her friendship at such a time, tell her so.; and add, that I really do not believe she can write. That will'provoke her, and I shall get four sheets of Bath post directly, telling me what an angel your brother is, and how dignified and stately the Earl of Charlemount appeared as he played the part of ' papa ' " She gave one of the little gay laughs of other days as she concluded. The earl looked at her, and counted all things cheaply,so he could but win that prize. "Perhaps I shall take advantage of .your ignorance, and forge .a letter, by way of sav- ing myself a journey out of town%" he sug- gested. "You had better. But I do not fear you. You are too honest.-too frank-too simple- hearted (you need not be offended at that ex- pression-it- is really the highest compliment I. could pay to any one) to do anything of the kind. It is a pleasure to me which I can- not put into words, this sense of your sincerity -your perfect trust. I even carry it so far, that when you eiy you love ne, I believe you. Yet others have told me the same thing, before   you, and it has taken them long--very:long, indeed-to convince me of it." Charlemount rose, hastily while she was speaking, and walked to the window.- His good angel took advantage of the remorse and shame that humbled him to the very dust, to suggest confession and atone ment while there was yet time. How could he possibly keep this treach. 'ery a secret fromther forever? How could he bear the swift, indignant scorn and hatred with which she would overwhelm him when it came to her knowledge? Would it not be better to take back his forfeited honor--to keep his broken promise-to give up Regina Ano, be- fore she grew even more .deeply into his heart? What was it, after all, ,but a question of time, since, sooner or later, she must'know ; and knowing, would at once infallibly desert him? Oh I that terrible "last moment," when we hang suspended, as it were, between good and evil I To how many of us, alas I it is but the pause before we plunge into a deeper gulf than we have ever dreamed of before-the halt upon the threshold of that home into which we enter, taking with us "seven other spirits,eworee than the first 1". Aword has turned the scale-nay, oftener by far, a look has done it! The moment passed for Oharlemount, for, even while he wavered, Regina called him to her side. "Are you so modest that you cannot bear to hear your own praises?" s he said, playfully. "I Will sing' them no more. When will you start on this journey?" "When you like." "To-morrow.". "Very well." "It is this delay that makes me anxious. If he was in such haste to marry her, that he per- suaded her to take this extraordinary step, how is it he loiters so now?" "Perhaps they are already married." "It. may be. But, I confess, I. think she would have writteni"  "At such times, you know, people labor under the impression that they matke up the entire world. But suspend your judgment till I bring you news."       , "And the letter?*. , . "And the letter, of course " .   .    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6470-00000051"/> "When shall you return?" "In two days-or, at the most, three. I give you fair warning, that if I find them still single, I shall give them short timhe for prep- arations. Harry had a little matter of busi- ness to settle in the North. I name the third day, in ease I should have to go there after him." "This is Tuesday. On Friday night, or Saturday morning, I may look for you?" "Without fail I And to recompense myself for this long absence, I shall bring. the lawyer out with me, and coax you into signing the settlements that very evening. "I will sign anything after I sm once as- sured that Ruth is safe, and well, and happy 1" said Regina. "Nothing till then!" She rose from her chair. He was leaning upon its carved back, and fancied, for a mo- ment, that she had changed her seat because he was so near. But he was mistaken. Her look said that the interview was over. *"You give me little time to talk to you," he said, reproachfully. "Never mind! You have many years be- fore you, and it is possible that you may not care to talk to me before they have all pass- ed!" "I shall be as fond of you then as I am aqw!" She shrugged her shoulders impatiently. At times (and this was one of them) she wanted no words or looks of tenderness. "I think lunch is nearly ready," she ob- served. "You had better go!" Let me stay and share it with you?" ' By no means!" "You are not very hospitable 1" he said,.in an offehded tone.  i"Hospitality, I believe-at all events, in the East-is reckoned one of the cardinal virtues. I never pretended to the possession of any of them. Moreover, I have a heathenish habit of reading when I take my meals.. You will ex- cuse me, if I say I prefer the company of a good book, at those times, even to yours!" "It is a habit you have taken up very late- ly " said the earl, whose evil genius seemed continually prompting him to offend. "On the contrary, I have had it for years." "You gave it up, then, for a time, sh?"   "' What do you mean?"P "Not very long ago, I knew some one who used to share your lunch with you. I think the book was laid aside when he did so." Regina turned, and looked at him with a ter rible glance. "It was Clifford!" "You have dared to name his name to me!" she burst out. "Have you suddenly takes leave'of your senses? Let me tell you, my lord, if you ever speak of him hereafter in my presence, you shall never enter these doors again!" "I wish to heaven I had shot him whsn he stood before me!" wad his reply. Regina looked at him a moment; then her brow cleared. "So!" she said, in a low tone, and turning her back on him she leaned against the mantel- piece, and rested her head upon her folded hands. ThelFrench clock on the cabinet chimed the quarter before either of them spare. Then she asked, without looking round: "Are you go- ing?" "Yes, if I must; but I have been a brute. Regina  Do you say you forgive me?" "For this time; but I advise you to take care how you offend in that way again!" "Will you not look up, will you not say good-bye?" he asked, very penitently. Had it been Ruth, or even Helen Erlinford, he would have lifted the drooping head, and looked into the averted eyes; but Regina had a power'over him which no other woman had ever possessed, and without permission he would scarcely have touched the hem of her garment. "You do not deserve it," she said, turning toward him with a face from which every ves- tige of color had fled. "Good heavens, Regina, how I have made you suffer!" he exclaimed, feeling nothing at that moment but the most sincere sorrow for his wanton attack. "It is nothing. But do not try such an ex- periment a second time. I am not made of iron I Take me as I am-a woman who can not give you either love or passion-" "Never?" he asked, interrupting her. "Never, Charlemount, I do not wish to Ae. seive you I will be a kind and faithful wife   to,you, and as true a friend as you ever had, or ever can have, on egrth; but that which I wast- ed on another went from me with his going, and [ cannot call it back again! With love like that lost love, I Lave nothing more to do!" In time you will learn. I leave all to time!" "My dear Ctarle mount, spring comes to the roses and theviolets every year, but she only pays poor human hearts one visit!" '.You con sctrcely reconcile your precept with your practice, or rather with your expe- rience." "I do not understand you." She pointed to her brother's portrait. "You loved Alfred?"  Yes." "He was your first love!" "True." "And the other?" Regina shuddered. ," Why do you wish to talk about it? Yet I will answer you, because you have a right to kuow. You have ae right to look into my heart, if you choose; but, remember it is only for this once!" "I will never speak of him again-but. if it does not pain you too much, tell me of him now!" "Alfred'was, as you say, my first love-the first love of a young and innocent girl! His beauty pleased me; his kindness won me; and to this day I remember our life-though'it was all so wrong--as I should remember some pleasant dream! There is nothing sad about it except his death, and time has softened even that." "Well! and this other?" "Ah, it was so different!" was the reply. "I had grown'old, and more than a little weary of the world. I had learned to doubt every- body and everything, and to fancy that the time for love had gone entirely .by. The knowledge of my mistake brought new life and vigor. It was like the stealing of fresh sap throutgh the limbs of a dead tree  it was- But why am I saying this to you?" "Go on." "No; let it all pass. You know how it ended. Perhaps it was as well! But that spring came so late in life, that there will be no summer now-nothing bt the sober autumn.   If you choose to, share it, the sun will do his best to shine upon you. I should not blame you, however, if you sought a more genial cli- mate elsewhere." . "If it was the dead of winter, I Would rather share it with you, than tnat much talked-of spring with another," was his low reply. t Very well; it is yours to choose. And' now we will ' let the dead, past bury its 'dead.' You know what I can give, and you profess to be content with the gift, paltry as it is. We need talk no more of love, till we die." "You seem quite pleased with the idea." Have I pained you? You would make me speak." "Tell me one thing more. If you learned to forget once, why cannot you learn a second time?"' It is impossible." "But why?" "You are wrong in asking such questions. The answer would not please you." "Still, let me have it." "An unhappy love is a'lov0 unforgotten," she said, quietly. Apparently, his thirst after knowledge was quenched; for he said no more.   Regina marched up and down the room, with folded arms, for a few minutes, and then turned upon him suddenly, with the remark:, II have just heard the bell"? ' "What bell?" "The one they ring in the kitchen, to let me know that lunch is ready." "Then I must take myself off?" "If you please. . Not with that face, though. Ah! foolish that you were. Why did you in- sist on my saying all this? It is never wise to pry into these things. Rely upon it, nine- tenths of the trouble in the world comes here simply because people will ask questions. Now, forget it all-tlake what Regina has left to bestow, aad be thankful." "I will." "Go, then. Stop! you shall have a flower; to remindyou of me, while you are away.". She entered the conservatory, and came back with a beautiful mhonthly rose, and a cluster of Neapolitan violets. She to uehed them lightly with her lips, and placed them in his hand.    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6470-00000052"/> "And here is a cluster of white roses. See that you do not let them fade. They are for  Ruth, and she is to wear them in her hair on her wedding-day." I will give them to her."  "He drew nearer, and placed his arm around her waist-but she shrank back from his clasp. ] ** There is my hand," she said, gravely, ex-  tending it. "Good-bye!" He kissed it, and left the room without a word. While he drove toward home, anxious and ead-and eyeing Ruth's roses with a wary glance-Regina was sitting-quietly over her lunch, with the first volume of a new and in. teresting novel in her hand, absorbed in the story, and never sending one single -thought after him. Truly, one of the wisest of the many French proverbs is this: "There is always one who loves, and who is nto loved!" *   *   *   *   *   * The garden of Wilverton Cottage was gay with autumn flowers,.and the trees, scattered here and there over its park-like meadows, were tinted faAtly with the colors of the dying year. Ruth walked beneath them, stirring the fallen leaves meditatively with her small foot, nd thinking how Charlemount had often spoken of the glory of the Indian summer in America -that time when earth and sky look their love- liest, and the wide forests are wrapped in a very blaze of glory, as the autumn passes si- lently away. Another year, and she should see that new world-and with him!  Yes, the wedding-day had dawned at last! A bright and beautiful day-a day of which the very air seemed conscious, so full was it of a joyous pulse and stir. The birds in the old elm beneath which she stood, sang songs of love and happiness in her willing ear, or darted in and out of their nests, upon the wild cottage wall, as if they would say: "See how happy we are; and all because we have a home, and some one in that home to love us. So it will be with you, Ruth, to-morrow." Ruth believed it all. She wore a simple bridal dress, of cloud-like muslin, and a sprig of jasmine in her beautiful brown hair, and walked to and fro in the shadow of the trees, thinking of Regina and Charlemounb--tlose two dearest to her on earth. The sunlight danced and flickered on the grass beside her;   and she sang out gayly, as she glanced that way: "Happy is the bride that the sun shines on!" A happy bride, indeed ;After, all those months of loneliness and misery-after all those weary days of lingering pain-behold her, loved, and only waiting for her husband's voice to tell her so; only waiting for his presence, and the ring upon her finger, to be more blest than ever woman was before! Ala I Ruth, hard as was your fate, is it not the com- mon fate of all? Each one among us will be "only waiting," and like you, toe many of us will be " only waiting," when death, for whom we have not waited," arrives to lead us into a distant land-the only land where " waiting is not known. Charlemount had not written to her; for, though the plot was simple enough in its de- tails, it had been very deeply and skillfully laid. But she had been accompanied by anU other confidential servant, and Howe had vis ited her twice, bringing good tidings when he came, and holding out hopes of his master's speedy arrival. "Business" detained him; but on the ap- pointed day she was to be ready, and he would be there-all the fonder for this long and tire- some delay. Ruth had no thought of an in- tended wrong; she obeyed his command, and now walked where she could catch the first glimpse of a carriage on the village road, and run through the avenue to the very lodge. gates to meet him. Dear Charlemount, he could not be offended, since so many weary days had passed without her seeing him. Howe had been in the village only two days before, and had brought with him his sister-a tall, dark-browed woman, who was to superin- tend the household arrangements at the cottage after their departure. Ruth had it in her heart to bestow this little place upon Regina, when they met; but it was a secret only meant for Chariemount's ear, and she said nothing of her plans, while the gloomy-looking Mrs. Maining ' took possession of the premises and the keys, and even installed her son-a boy of eighteen --as major-domo, in the place of Charlemount's. own servant,who returned to town. Ruth took t little not ce of household matters, else she , might have wondered at some of the changes   Mrs. Maining was quietly making in some of the sleeping apartments on the third floor. The servants were'removed to the left wing of the building; and in the right, three room3 were fitted up with the greatest attention to the comfort of the future occupant; but, at the same time, they were furnished with strong bolts and locks, and the windows were guarded on the outside with iron bars. They looked out upon a fine avenue and a miniature lake- a favorite resort of Ruth's-but the clustering ivy around the easements prevented her ob- serving their novel ornaments, when  she strolled that way. Indeed so wrapped was she in pleasant reveries and day-dreams, at this time, that they might almost have placed the cottage in a state of siege without her know edge. Ten o'clock struck from the tower of the v- lage church, and Ruth strained her eyes eagerly down the baked, white road, and listened for the sound of carriage wheels; for it was the hour named for Charlemount's arrival. A dark speck rose in relief against the distant sky-it drewnearer-and she saw a single horseman coming down the hill at full gallop. The earl  And, too impatient to wait a slower pace, he was hurrying to her at the swiftest speed of his far-famed bonny bay.     t A momentary fit of shyness made her run to- ward the house. Mrs. Maining met her in the hall. ' He is coming!" cried Ruth, breathlessly. "So soon?" said the housekeeper. "Yes; I saw him on the hill. He is rid- ing." "Ah!" said the housekeeper, as she turned her head away and smiled. Well she knew who the eager horseman must be. "I shall run up-stairs, tothe very top of the house., I can see him there " cried Ruth; and she flew away like a bird. The house- keeper followed, as fast as might be, and iin- locked the door of an empty, unused apartment in the third story of the right wing. ' This room looks out upon the avenue and the lodge," she said, respectfully; "and there is no dust here. It would be a pity to spoil that pretty dress 'by going into any other place."    Ruth looked down, with a fond glance, at her muslin robe. ,' You are right, Mrs. Maining; I will stay here. But I cannot see him -now," she added, as she approached the window "It is the turn of the road that hides him." "I will have it made straight. Ah you are laughing, Mrs. Maining. But you must , imagine how glad I am I It seems an age since I have seen him; and this is our wedding- day!" The housekeeper smiled. Do you know the earl?" continued Ruth. "Yes, miss." Are you -one of the family servants, then?" The housekeepei busied herself in dusting the vacant chimny-.piece, as she answered in the affirmative. But her face turned crimson, and she glanced toward her unobservant mis- tress, as she clapped her hands, and cried out: "There he is again 1" with a glance that seemed made up alike of pity and of hate. Ruth watched a moment longer. The horse- man passed the lodge gates, and came swiftly up the avenue. "It is Howe!" she exclaimed, in a tone of dismay. "Oh, Mrs. Maining, something has happened  Oh, go and see!" She sprung toward the door herself, but staggered, and would have fallen if the woman had not caught her in her arms. -"My lord is probably in the carriage, and has sent Howe on to tell you," said Mrs. Main- ing, soothingly. "Let me get you some water, miss; you look so faint!"  "No, no; I am better now. You are sure nothing can have happened?" -( Indeed, miss, you will see .my lord here in ten minutes, I am certain I There is Howe cantering up to the door; may he come up here?" '"Oh, yes--noow, at once!" Ruth leaned against the mantelpiece, still trembling with the sudden shock. Mrs. Main ing opened the window, and calling the man by name, made a peculiar sign to him. He nod- ded, and smiled. The next moment, they beard him' coming -quickly up the stairs. Ruth sprang forward as he entered, and looked at him anxiously.  -    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6470-00000053"/> "What is it? Where is your master? Is he ill? Has he met with any accident?" "No, my lady," esid Howe, giving her a kind of * brevet rank" as he bowed low. * I am only the message from him. Sarah, you had better leave us l" "What is that for?" asked Ruth, a little startled.  'Servants are not always trustworthy, my lady; and, to tell the truth, my sister, though one of the best of women in every other way, is a little curious-especially about this mar- riage. -We had better talk in a more private place, even, than this." "The other rooms are all locked on this floor, Howe." "If you will allow me, I will convince you to the contrary." He crossed the floor, and ran his hand along the wall. A dusty old picture moved from its place, and another room appeared before the startled eyes of Ruth, hung with arras, and fur- nished in the moit expensive and luxurious style. ," Why, what is this?" she cried. i"A little surprise, my lady. My lord de- sired me to show these apartments to you be- fore he came." She passed throught the apartment, he fol- lowed, and the entrance closed after them. The bird was in her cage I She gazed around with a delighted smile. Rose-colored curtains hid the barred windows from her eyes; fresh flowers perfumed the apartment with their delicious breath; books and pictures, statues, and engravings of the rarest kind, were scattered lavishly around, and a harp and guitar stood near an antique music- stand of carved ebony inlaid with gold. "It is like fairy-land!" she cried. "And did Charlemount plan all this for me?" "He did, indeed, my'lady l" was the grave reply. "How kind-how good he is! But how have you managed it so well, that I knew no- thing of what was going on?" "Your apartments were in the other wing, my lady; and the workmen were often here in the middle of the night." "Dear Charlemount!" said Ruth, musingly. "Are there no other rooms, Howe?"   "A dressing-room and bed-room beyond, my lady." "I will not look at them, just yet." She sat down in a chair of crimson velvet and ivory, and leaned her head back with a happy smile. "Tell me your message, Howe. It is certainly quiet enough here." "Yes, my lady." "And how soon will he come?" There was a slight pause. Then the man an swered, in a quiet tone "Never, my lady 1" Ruth dropped the flower she had taken from a vase, and turned toward him. "What did you say?" "You will never see the Earl of Charlemount here!" "What-what can you mean? It is not kind, Howe-it, is not respectful. How dare yqu say such things to me? The earl shall be informed of it as soon as he arrives!" Howe only smiled. He had been standing at a little distance from her chair; now he came nearer, and looking down at her with a peculiar glance, said, distinctly: "He has deserted you, but I love you. Let me fill his place!" One thing was clear; the man was intoxicat- ed. And yet, as Ruth said this to herself, she looked up into the dark, quiet face, and shrank back, faint and frightened, in her chair. It was not the face of an intoxicated man. But surely he was mad? "I think I must go down stairs!" she said, timidly. "There is not the slightest need of your do- ing so. Besides, I wish you to keep me com- pany-to remain here 1" "Good heavens I what can all this mean 1" "Will you promise to hear me quietly, if I tell you?" "Yes." You will not go to fainting away, or scream. ing 9" "No. Oh, pray go on!" "Well, then, we will go back a year or two!" said Howe, leaning against the mantelpiece, and looking down at her. "You remember when my lord first met you?" "Yes," said Ruth, with pale lips. "You were kind enough to live with. him fore   a little while, and he was really very fond of you, then!" "Then? So he is now." Howe laughed. "My dear lady, is it possible you have thought him in earnest all this while? He fol- lowed you to Paris; he met you there; he wrote to you often. Are any of those letters signed with his own name?" "No," faltered poor Ruth. ', Neither are they in his own handwriting, but in mine!" "What?" "It is a fact, I assure you. My lord is a very cautious man. Those letters can never com- promise him in any way." "Where is he?" cried Ruth, wildly. "4Oh! let me go to him! I know he loves me! I will not believe this that you are saying!" Wait one moment I He returned to Eng- land; he met you at Hegina's cottage; he sent you here?" "Well?" "And to-morrow- ' , Whs 3 tv .Marrov w? "He is to be varrie3i my dear-but not to you," Ruth's eyes turned toward him with a look of dumb agony. "' Tt cannot be!" she moaned. "Will this convince you?" He held a blurred and blotted note toward her, and she read: "shall be married by special license, and start from London to-morrow. You must take charge of Ruth, sad break this matter to her. To ask forgiveness of her is so cruel a farce. that, bad as I am, I will not attempt it, e'            CHARLEMOINT. "iP. S.-Whatever .you do, must be sure! I have risked too much to lose at the last moment! Ruth must never cross my path again-or hers!" The paper fell from her trembling hand-she gasped once or twice, and then -sank back in her chair, senseless. Howe put the letter carefully in his pocket- bnok, and stood and looked at her, without en- deavoring to assist her in any way. "' Curious creatures women are!", he solilo- quized. "She Inoks like a broken lily, in that white dress. I wonder if Regina fainted when that fool of a Clifford went away? I should Ithink not; she has too much pluck. But this )ne-how beautiful she is! and what a scene   we shall have when she. comes to her senses again " "  Slowly the color stole back 'to the poor, &amp;pale faee. He watched it curiously; and met the glance of the wild brown eyes with an unmoved air. "I am glad you are better!" "What is it? What have you said?" she asked, passing her hand feebly over her eyes. "Only that the earl is going to be married!" She winced, as if he had aimed a blow at her. "And -that I am quite wiling to be youn bridegroom, my beauty, rather than that you should have none!" "Will no one take this man away?" she mui- mured, looking helplessly around. No one, my dear. Who should? The ear, has given you up to me, as you see; and the best thing you can do is, to let me show you how very kind and gallant I am , when it suits me to be so. You':are very beautiful- more beautiful than Regina, after all-and I wonder at his taste in choosing her." * Than who?" gasped Ruth. "Regina-the actress!" "Is it her? Is he going to marry her?" asked Ruth, in a tone of astonishment. Howe nodded. ' But Clifford?" "She has sent him about his business!" "O Heaven! I must go to her! I must tell her! Oh, she will give him up to me at once when she knows all!" She sprang up from her chair, and tried to open the door, It was bolted! She ran her hand over the wall, but the secret spring re- fused to yield to her unpracticed. touch. She threw open the door of the bed-room  and dressing-room, but they could only be entered or left by the boudoir. She drew back the silken curtains of the window and saw the iron bars. The truth seemed to flash upon her in an instant. She turned to Howe, who had not moved from his lounging position. but had fol- lowed her frantic movements with a quiet smile.        : "Am  a prisoner?" "I fear you are!" " y his orders?" "Yes " '    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6470-00000054"/> "This is why he sent me here' " "You have guessed it l" "O Regina--Regina!" She sank down upon the floor, utterly over- owered, and hiding herface inher hands,-wept itterly and-despairingly. "You make me think of those poor devils of birds I have seen in shop windows, in London,"   said Howe. ".They-go about their cages just as you went about these rooms, and knock their silly heads against the bars, and look out with frightened eyes if any one comes near them; and; though they don't- say 'Regina!' at the end, I dare say they think it. Probably, they have all -eft a Regina in the new from which they were taken, if the-truth was told."   "CHAPTER   X. Oh, think of all the thousand ways In which you strive to torture me!- Think how you twinefame's glossy, boughs With the dead leaves of Treachery! Think how yourhand now shuts me out From human love and sympathy, Till faith in man becomes a doubt And heaven a vast blue mystery!-M. B.   Ruth lifted her streaming eyes to his. "Hoe, if you pity those poor birds, pity me! I am far more wretched than they are!" I never said I pitied them." "Oh, but you do-you cannot help it. I know you have a kind heart; . have often thought so." He laughed. "I dare say." "I have indeed, Howe. When you came twice, and told me about him, I said how kind you were." "If you made such a preposterous blunder, it is quite time I set you right. If I have a heart at all-and I often doubt it-it is harder than the nether millstone. I care no more for your sighs and tears than I care for the piping of those foolish birds-except that I think you look rather pretty while you are weeping, if such a thing is possible. Most women make frights of themselves if they cry-you do not; and so you can go on as long as you like; I do not object to it in the least." The man's look and language were so differ. ent from anything she had ever seen in him before, that Ruth almost forgot her misery in her astonishment; as she gazed at him. He drew himself up to his full height, and made a gesture as if he Was easting something from him. "There, for the present I will be myself. I will throw aside this disguise of servitude, and speak out like a man: 't relieves me inex- pressibly--and besides, you may be more ready   to'listel to me when you see me in my best aspect/ I have one." Ru  rose from the floor, wiped away her tears, and sat down again in the velvet chair, sick and dizzy, and longing to know what all these startling seenes and words could mean. Charlemount false?  Oh, it could not be! This man was evidently not a servant: she had been imposed upon-he was seeking to win her by some terrible falsehood, but he should find her true-true and patient. And let the plot be what it might, her brave Charle. mount would find a way to cut its threads and save her. All would be well, in time. "Have you no curiosity about me Ruth?" asked 'Howe, finding she did not speak. "Why should I have? What can you. pose sibly be to me, that 1 should take an interest in you or your position? If you were a prince of the blood-royal it would make no difference. Charlemount stands between' us 1" ' Idiott you had better say that Regina stands between you and Charlemount-as she does." "I do not believe it 1" "Capital ' What do you believe,'then?" "That you are oue of Charlemount's friends -at least, that you call yourself one-and that you have taken advantage of some confi- dence he has placed in you, to try and make me hate him. The attempt Js a most useless one; I shall pay no attention 'to what you say and he himself r ill punish you for your treadh - ery when he hears of it."     <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6470-00000055"/> Howe laughed-a low, long, sarcastic laugh, that was by no rmeans pleasant to hear. "Upon my word, the faith you women have in us men is refreshing. You will believe me soon enough, however. And so you take me for one of his friends?" * One of his seeming frl!"Bs." "T wonder what he would say to that! My dear, T am sony to knock your pretty little r.,mnqn, on the head; but I must. I am not a gent'emon-at least, by birth; I am the son of a very poor Yorkshire farmer; and I have been Lord Charlemount's servant ever since T was sixteen, and he thirteen, years old. His confidential servant, too; and that means very much." Ruth's courage began to fail; and, leaning hack, she covered her eyes with her hand. If indeed, this was true, might not all be? "I was with the earl-he was not an earl then, though-at school, and at a university abroad," continued Howe. A promising youth he was. You, who have such an affectionate faith in him, would he quite .charmed with the details of his early life; but I will not enter into them. It is quite enough to tell you that women and wine' have been his ' rocks ahead' ever since I have had the pleasure of knowing him, and that you are by no means the only fair lady who has trusted him too far." Ruth did not answer this taunt. A cold hand, like the hand of death, seemed on her heart, and yet her temples burned and throbbed with agony, and her cheeks were flushed as he had never seen them before. "A color becomes you, my dear. No rouge that you 'ever wore upon the stage was half so beautiful as that you have now. But I think you do not like compliments, and so I will go on with my story. You must know that the earl was always very fond of me. I came to him a rough, ignorant boy; indeed, he took me out of his father's stables, if the truth must ie told, because i pleased him by my hold riding, qnd could stick in my saddle, when I went over a five-barred gate, as if I grew there. He was very kind to me, and gave me all the advantages in his power; and, as I was not quite an idiot, T improved them. At school, at the university, I served him; but I also studied hard, and he helped and encour.   aged me. 'When he left G'ermany, I really think I was the better man of the two at the classics. lou would hardly think that of me, would you, my dear Ruth?" She was sient. 'Dumb still?" he continued, with a smile. "Well, I am coming to something that will in terest you more. I am going to tell you how i loved that man whom you are loving at this very moment. His own brother never was half so devoted to him. I would have died for him. I owed him everything;. it was almost as if he had created me; and I paid him that service and worship that theologians say we ought to pay to Him who really did turn us from the dust of earth into living beings. It went on for a few years, and then how do you think he repaid all that fidelity and affection?" "As he repaid mine," murmured Ruth. "You are not far wrong. There was a girl ' -a momentary spasm crossed his dark, quiet face-" a girl'as beautiful and as pure as you were before he met you; and I loved her with all my heart, and was going to make her my wife. She loved me, too-at least, she fancied she did; and we were happier, I think, than human beings ever were before. By lfeaven even now, and here, beneath this roof, the memory of Alice makes a boy of me again 'f He leaned his head upon his clasped hands, and something like a sob burst from his lips. But before Ruth could take advantage of this gentle mood, he controlled himself, and went on with his tale, in the same cold tone: "I told my master of her. I took him to see her.. I went away, by his suggestion, to prepare a little homne for her. I worked hard -but it was a labor of love. When the cot. tage was ready, and I returned for my bride, where do you think she was?" ":1T pity you from the bottom of my heart," said Ruth, gently. "Bah! I do not. want your pity! I swore, on that day, that from your sex I would accept neither lover nor sympathy again: Alice had gone abroad, and with Charlemount; hut she did not return with him. In six months he was back again in England, gay and happy as ever. He had left her abroad." "Poor girl!" "Ah!' said Howe, with a quiet smile, "yon   need not pity her, either. Both he and I were mistaken in Alice. I thought her pure, and he thought her meek and forgiving.  I knew, years ago, that I had been at fault; but it is reserved, for him to learn wisdom later yet. "How long ago was all this?" "Fifteen years." "He must have been a mere boy." "Scarcely older than his son is now." "His son! Had she a child?" "Yes." "And does he know this?"  "Not at present; but he will be informed in time." Ruth sat lost in thought. It was far less bitter to lose this Charlemount than the Char- lemount she had loved. And yet she could forgive him all-nay, she must forgive it, and save Regina from a doom which she, least of all women, could bear-that of marrying a man who was not worthy of her, and whom she did not love. "If he has injured you so, why are you with him still?" she asked. "He has injured you as deeply, and yet you would pardon him, and that gladly," said Howe, ho seemed able to read her thoughts by atching her face. "I am a woman." "Well, it may be that we forgive as well as you!"  She looked -at him a moment. "No, you have not forgiven him." "I have given up every hope and prospect in life simply to be near him. I might have raised myself, far above my station, in another land; for I have talent, though you may not think it. In America, for instance, where rank is not inherited, but won, I might have filled a high place in the eyes of men. I know it-I felt my power-l Perhaps, even here, in Eng- land, I cotld have risen from obscurity, if I chose to exert myself. But I preferred to stand behind the chair of the Earl of Charle- mount-to manage his amours-to write his letters-witness those which charmed you so in Paris. I not only wrote, but I composed them, Ruth."  "Oh, this is bitter," she sighed. "Well, take the dose without making any, funs about it; and show yourself a woman of   sense, and join with me in the revenge I shall have some day 1" "Revenge?" "What else do you think I am living for? I came to him after-after Alice was lost to- me, and said that I forgave him. He believed me. He took me back into his service, and thought he made amends for all by the heavy salary he gave'me, and the trifling labor he al- loted to my share. I was with him when he married-and when he murdered-that unfor- tunate wife of his!' -"Murdered!" "Make yourself easy; he did it legally, and with all propriety. Yet the poor lady was no less murdered than if he had stabbed her to the heart. Well, then he went abroad. I was with him! He came to England. I was with him! He won you; he won a thousand others; he threw them aside, and yet I was with him! He loves now, for the first time in his whole life, and I am with him! He goes abroad with Regina. I shall be with him still! Believe me, Ruth, if Satan were at his elbow, in per- son, it would be as well. For fifteen years I have led him on from crime to crime-his soul has been steeped in vice beyond redemption; and it has all been my work! His punishment hereafter being certain, only one thing re- mained-to torture him here on earth. I had almost despaired of success, till now; but he loves Regina-he loves Regina, and I can strike him to the very heart, by means of her -and of that affection!" "Good heavens!" cried Ruth. "Was ever anything more horrible? You cannot mean it!" "Every word. I have \ever said it before; I cannot tell you how it has relieved me." "If it is all true," said Ruth, rising, "I will save him!" "From what, pray?9"   "From you, and from myself!" "In what way?"P "At least, he shall not marry Regma." "What a disinterested creature you are But let me finish my story: let me tell you how this wedding was brought about. Do you remember the meeting at your chamber win. dow the night before you came here." "What of it?"    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6470-00000056"/> u I planned it. It was a clever thing, I must say. While you and Charlemount were billing: and cooing there, Clifford was perched upon the wall, looking' at you, and fancying it was hisbeloved Regina all the while," "Good Heaven I is this true?" ", As gospel, my dear. I have laughed till I cried over the scene a thousand times since. He tried to strike the earl, but tumbled down in the lane in a fit, and we bupdled him into a cab and sent him home, like a pair of good Samaritans as we were." ," And then-what then? Oh, if you have any mercy, tell me more!" ", Why, what could you expect? Of course, he quarreled With Regina, and then with Char- lemount. They fought-the earl was hit, and Clifford ran away. Then Regina very kindly received her champion; and the end of all is, that to-morrow' they are to be married and start for Italy-w-ith me-for .I meet them m Paris. Is it jot an interesting story?" "Planned I That meeting was. planned? And by him--with his consent!" moaned Ruth. *"Of course it was. But don't faint away again-what good will that do? You see now what the visit to Paris was for. I planned that also. It was the only way I could see for him, to win her. "What had I ever done to you that you should break my heart so cruelly?" said Ruth,! looking at him with her large, sad eyes.' "Done to me?  Why, nothing!  AnA I never gave you a; thought in the matter, one: way or another, except that the fact of your loving and trusting him made his rascality ten' thousand times deeper; atd because Regina is so fond of you, that when she finds it all out-- ah, what a scene that will be I By Heaven! I hall be paid for all I have suffered when the ay comes I And there is another thing, in store for him; but. that I leave to Alicee-for she will be there I And you Ruth, will you, come with us, too?" "Oh, let me die!-let me die!" she moaned,. resting her forehead on the cool marble of the' chimney-piece. "If you prefer it. But you have something to do first." "What?"   "Consent to .make me happy!" She looked at him with a vacant glance. "I swore never to receive love or tenderness from your sex again when Alice, deserted me. But--" A glimpse of his meaning flashed across her bewildered brain, and she uttered a cry of fear. "Man, have you no mercy?   Oh, let me go!-let me go and warn him before it is too late!" "Go, by all means-if you can!" was his mocking reply. She knelt at his feet. "See-I will beg you, like this, to- let me go!" "You know I shall do nothing of the kind. What do you think I made this journey for? The earl himself begs that' you will not favor him or Regina with your company; you know. I, on the contrary, shall be exceedingly grate. ful for it, till I am obliged to leave you. And if you like, in the course of a few months, Alice herself will tell you when you can join me again." Ruth darted to the window, and called aloud for help., "Don't strain your voice, my dear," he said, quietly. "The village is at some little dis- tance, and I may. as well tell you now, that ev- ery one in Wilverton supposed you to be a mad lady, brought here by your keepers for the sake of quiet and country air. Even if they should happen to hear your cries,. they would run away instead of coming to help you. Mrs. Maining has taken care of that. She told ,the workmen that one of your violent parox- ysms was coming on, when she employedthem to put those strong bars before your windows. You will'find that we have thought of every- thing-prepared for everything!" "Mad " 'exclaimed Ruth, looking at him with a despairing glance. "'Well, perhaps' shall be so'on Oh, let me go Hlet me go for Heaven's sake!"P . Howe's only answer was a smile, as he step- ped forward and sounded a little bell that hung from the wall. A dumb-waiter rose through the floor, furnished with a delicate and tempt- ing meal. "You. see we have adopted some of the hab-   its of Brompton cottage," he said, courteously. ' I will leave you to your lunch. At seven, I shall have the honor of dining with you,. I trust to find you kinder then than, you are inclined to be now; for you know, my dear, that you must submit, either willingly or un- willingly, to all the arrangements I, have made here for your comfort and for mine." He toubhed the secret spring as he spoke,. nd passed quickly into the next room. Ruth dragged herself to the wall, and sought dili- gently with her trembling fingers for its. con- cealed door. ,In vain I in vain! Twenty-four hours more, and Regina would, be lost like Charlemount, while she raved in the prison which he whom she loved had so. cunningly' and so faithlessly devised. *   *   +   C*  *   * The Earl of Charlemount rose very\ early on the morning after Howe's departure forWil- verton-so early that .not a housemaid in the establishment was up; and only a. faint streak of dawning light was visible in the east. He rang the bell of his dressing-room very gently, and presently there entered to him Roberts, the functionary who had been dismissed from Ruth's cottage, tr make. room for the son of Mrs. Maining. Any letters yet, Roberts?" asked the earl, anxiously. "None, my lord," replied the man, as he stirred the fire dighted by. his own hands at 4 A. M.) in a little 'aloon opening out of the dressing-room.  "Give me some breakfast, and take this let- ter to St. Edward's Square immediately." "Yes, my lord."  Roberts disappeared.. While the brealfast is being prepared, let us look over the earl's shoulder as he dashes off a dispatch to his, crony, Tom Grosvenor: MY DE4R FEL OW: . Have your parson ready at the proper hour. I have not yet heard from H., but all must go well inthat quarter. Luck, havtin served me faithfully so'far, will hardly desert me now. I shall' see her at elght.

No one neecdacme to, me till you re- turn.. I shall dress. by, myself." ' Wondering m what the deuce was the mat- ter," Roberts departed, and the earl devoted himself toX breakfast, staring vacantly into the fire, as he munched his toast, and scalding him self with his coffee. A few hours, and his des tiny: would, be decided; a few hours, and Re., gina would be hisaown, if nothing happened to overturn his carefully-laid plans. What could happen. He did not know; but the guilty are ever full of fear, and' he trembled like a cow- ard over the brink of a 'happiness so exquis- ite, that it seemed to him only like a dream. He dressed hurriedly, but carefully, hiding his bridegroom's apparel under a paletot of blameless sobriety in out and color. Roberts, coming back, found him walking, nervously, up and down the room; and gave him a small note, written on the fly-leaf of a volume of French plays. He read it through, and a deep color suffused his face. It is all right, Roberts. Have you,seen to everything?"    .  "To 'everything, my lord. The coachman has just gone to the station with the trunks and imperials." '   .. "Very. well. Is the brougham ready.?" "Yes, my lord."  "You are to go out with me. And--tell the people before we set out."      . In ten minutes the eard and'his servant were progressing swiftly toward, Regina's home, while the servants' hall was filled with a group of wondering domesties, diepussing the aston- ishing news which had ^just bee', gonmruni- cated to them. *'A Countess pf Oharlemrount  and married no one knows where, or by whom! Going off, too, to France, insuch a, hurry, and without even a wedding-breakfast!" "My 'lord is madl'l, exclaimed the stout cook, indignantly; and the: housekeeper nod. ded her head approvingly at the daring speech., and'the tall footman cried : "Bravo!"No one among them oared to see a mistress ruling, in.

I    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6470-00000057"/> am afraid those were but sorry congratulations which were uttered behind the earl's back; aid a though plenty of chaampagne and claret flowed later on in the day, not once was the bride's I health drank by those who were so soon to form the members of her household, and the doers of her will. At the Brompton cottage everything was going on quiet, as usual. Regina, having break- fasted (for it was one of her " early days'),  was lying on a sofa in her dressing-room, look- I iug languidly at Prudence, who was emptying  the contents of a set of drawers upon the I chairs, and packing them neatly for the jour- ney so soon to be taken.        I , Why in the world have you begun so soon?" asked Regina, with a terrific yawn. "You have days yet before you "' "But, my dear, you forget that I have many things to see to beside this. There is the breakfast! "* I don't mean to have one, Prudence." The worthy woman looked horrified. "No breakfast My dear, it would hardly be a wedding without one." "Indeed! I always labored under a foolish impression that the ceremony at church had something to do with the wedding." "No breakfast!" "* Who is to eat it, pray? Do you suppose Lord Charlemount and I are going to amuse ourselves by sitting down to it alone?" !"There is tke manager, Mr. Irwin." "He is out of Own. I sent a note to his house yesterday; and he has been gone a week. NLo, Prudence, I'll have no breakfast of my own The servants may have a feast, if they like-and I dare say they will. But I shall start almost from the church-door for Paris -dear, old Paris. Do you know, Prudence, the pleasantest part of the whole business to me is, that I shall see that city again- -and , o soon 1 Prudence went on folding and paceing, for time, in perfect silence. At last, without looking up, she said: "My dear, at times I think you are doing wrong." "I am dofhg that;always.". "But in this one thing." "How?"   Don't be offended, my dear, if I ask you a very plain question. Do you love this earl?" ," Not a bit!" was the cold rely. "And you know it very well." "Pause, then, my dear, and reflect." "Not I. I have had enough of reflecting to last me all my life. Besides, it is too late now!' "Thou wilt repent!" said the good woman -speaking in French-as she came and leaned affectionately over her nursling. "No l" "Thou wilt tire of him!"  I  No 1" Prudence drew a long breath, and shook her head, sadly. "Oh, my sweet one!-I fear-I fear!" Regina was silent. She changed her posi. tion once or twice,'and finally sat upright, and looked into the kind old face that bent over her. "Prudence, I like him, and T will try to be good to him, for his own sake, and for Alfred's." "But why marry him?" "For his cor6net, to be sure!" said the girl, frankly. "And then, I know how it will pain -pain--some one, to hear it." ," Ah!" The old woman returned to her packing. She was a woman, and she understood this bit of feminine revenge-possibly sympathized with it. At all events, she said no more against it. (' What are you putting up all those frippe- ries for?" asked Regina, contemptuously. "I will not/have them." "But a bride, my dear!" "Bride, or no bride, they shall not go. r Thrust them out-give them to the maids. I Poor Ruth! she ought to be here to succeed to them. She has a feminine love for knick. nacks. I wish I had.

Do you rememnber that, Prudence " t  "Yes.  But Miss Ruth will hardlye look more beautiful than you, my dear, in, your g robes. The dress is enough to make any one expire with envy; and as for the veil and the orange flowers-' i Prudence, what are you talking aboutt I  hate ordered no bridal dress '   "You order no dresses, my dear, at any time!" said the good woman, a little fright- ened at the result of her temerity.. "Do you mean to say that you have been conspiring to trick me out in white satin and epnge blossoms?" asked Regina, half angry, half amused." "My dear, the dress will be here to-morrow. When you cast your eyes upon it, you will re- pent anything your may say against it to-day." "You may give it to Eliza or to Jane. I will not wear it. White, indeed! and for me! I wonder at you, Prudence " "But be reasonable, my child! What. will you wear?"  "Black, of course." Prudence uttered a little shriek of dismay. "Married. in black? Who ever heard of such a thing? What good fortune would at- tend such a wedding as that would'be?" "Not much, I dare say!" replied Regina, with a melancholy smile. "But then, good fortune is not for mel You dear old woman, don't you see that mourning is the only suita- able dress, after all? There, we will say no ,more about it. I protest we shall have no wedding if you do!" A' knock at the door silenced the eloquent appeal Prudence was about to make. She open- ed it, and John tendered a card, which she gave to Regina. "The Earl of Charlemount here, and at this hour of the dav? It must be some mistake! John!" The servant entered. "Who gave yoa this?" "Roberts; Miss Regina!" "And who is Roberts, pray?" "Servant out of livery, Miss Regina-a kind of confidential servant to Lord Charlemount." "Humph!"  "His lordship is waiting," John ventured to beerve. "O Where?" "In the study." "Did he give you any message.?" "No, Regina."  "Well, you may go. I will come down. What can it mean, Prudence?" she added, asJ John retreated. - .  "Eight of the clock," said Prudence, look- 8   ing at the time-pieee on the mantel shelf- ' Something must have happened, my dear!" "To Ruth!" said Regina, starting from the mirror before which'she stood. "I am sure of it l" And without another word, she flew down the stairs, with white lips, and a heart beating so tha she could scarcely draw her breath. Charlemou  looked pleased at seeing eier simple dressi g-gown, a,1 with her hair care- lessly arranged. Het ftu.,ied3 she had been: in such hs*te to meet him ; for the moment, he 'quite forgot thoe etter qt whicqh he was thetlu posed bearer, and ap[rang forward to welcome her with all a lver's eagerness.

What of her  In she ill 9 Has she sent you for me? Speak!" "Ruth is well I!" The color came back to her lips, and .he went and sat down in her easy-chair.

"A regular Italian, schoolgirl, senti- mental hand, and asea -a forget-me-not, with a French motto I' Good Ruth!" She opened the letter. Charlemoupt watch- ed her face anxiously. She read it first to herself, and then aloud. "Just listen, Charlemount!- "( MY DEAREST--- "i have only just time to say 'well and happy v in answer to your questions!

"Poor little fool 1" was Regina's first re- mark, as she concluded. "I hope he will be good to her." '"He is devoted to her 1" "For how long?" "For a life-time, of course 1" "That does not follow!" she said, shrugging her shoulders.  But never mind; tell me of the wedding I Did you give the bride away?" "I had that honor."  "Ruth cried, I dare say?" "A little!" "All women do!" "Why, I wonder?" "Possibly because they imagine they are to have very good reasons for tears in the future," said Regina, dryly. "Ah!" "Did she look pretty?" "Very!" "And they are in Paris now?" "They are!" Charlemount, whi -had been suffering through this cross-examination suich torture as a man pnust always suffer who descends to falsehood, gladl  turned the 'conversation when it had re hed this point. "Shall we join them there, Regina?" "How long do they remain? It depends on that!" "Only a day or two." "So that in order to join them--" ", We should be married at once." "What does 'at once' mean?" "This very morning," he said, desperately, thinking it best to speak out, without further diplomacy. "You are beside yourself to think of such a thing 1" she replied, with a merry laugh. "No; listen, Regina I A friend of mine has promised to perform the oeremony.-he is the eurate of a quiet little parish church, where no one will ever come to look at us-another friend will be there as witness. Everything is quite ready for the journey. . Mrso Prudence can at- tend to all things here at three hour's no'ice."   "Upon my word, you are an artless youth!" she exclaimed. 'tYou have made all arrange. ments, I see. Now, what if I refuse?" "You will not, for Ruth's sake!" She stood and thought for a few moments. while he raced up and down the room with feverish i6patience.  ,  After all, it- may as well be sooner as la- ter," she said, at last. "Do you consent?" "On one condition," "Name it." "That you do not find fault with my som- bre garb"-and she touched her black dress. "I cannot wear colors. I have wanted to speak to you about this before." "As if I cared for your dress, my dar. ling!" he cried, rising up, and taling both her hands in his. "Ah Regina, how happy you have made me I'i She looked at him with a melancholy smile. I am glad if I can make any one happy." ' My lawyer will be here in a few moments. I sent Robert back with the brougham. Every- thing can be arranged before eleven o'clock, and at twelve-at twelve-I shall stand Here, again beside my wife-Regina!" He would have embraced her, but she drew back. "Y6u have never allowed me to touch those beautiful lips'yet, my love l" "They will soon be your own;" she said, gravely. "I must leave you now. My poor Prudence, she will be quite wild when she hears of this new plan. She is to go with us?" "Of course, and all your pets; too-I have seen to everything. Hhwe and Roberts are to be devoted especially to their welfare and conm fort on the trip. All you-have to do, my love is to put on your bonnet and your dress, and drive to church with me. Everything else is arranged, or will be before we return. I ex- pect Iowe every moment." "Good-bye, then, for the present. I am sorely afraid you will repent all this haste one day, my lord." lie smiled, unbelievingly, as he kissed her hand.  So that the hours passed by, and all was well till she was truly his own, he had lit tle fear for the future.   Regina went up to her own room, smiling,  half sadly, half gravely, to herself. Over the horror and despair of Prudence at the tale she had to tell, we will be content .to draw a veil. Let it iuffice to say, that impossibilities were rendered possibilities by her energetic move- ments when she recovered from the first stupor of astonishment, and that at ,exactly eleven o'clock-the settlements having been signed, and the hall filled with a collection of imperi- als. trunks, and boxes, packed. by the united force of the domestic staff-a procession of three carriages moved from the gate, and took its way toward a little parish church beyond the confines of Hammersmith. In one, sat Regina, dressed in mourning, but looking very beautiful, with the gauze folds of her robe fall- ing gracefully around her stately form. and a single diamond blazing like a star in the jetty braids above her brow. Prudence accompa- nied her. In' the other carriage, came the earl. The third was to bring back the happy bride and groom, and afterward to take them to the station, in time for the first afternoon train for Paris. Regina was very silent, and said: "( Clifford! Clifford!" her leart kept saying, all theway; and looks, and words, and tones shehad hoped were quite forgotten, came up before her with a startling power, now that the thought of them was so soon to be a sin. In those green  lanes through .which her carriage was rolling swiftly, they had strayed for hours in the geni- al spring sunshine. Under that hawthorn, near that drooping willow, they had paused and talked of a happy future to be shared to- gether. The leaves had scarcely lost their green, and yet he was far away, and this was her wedding morning. By yonder stile, across the fields, they had watched the cricketers at their merry games. Between those level hedge- rows they had paced to and' fro, shut out from the world and seeing nothing but the blue heaven overhead-hearing nothing but the singing of happy birds, or' the- low tones of each other's happier voices. There was the Priory, and they had gone one day into thei quiet little chapel, and looked with curious awe at' the burning liehte, and the silent nuns, kneeling in their violet habits before an altar decked with flowers and candles, and gay with gifts. He had said, how dear a thing it seemed   I to pray, since he could pray' for here-had said it with his own sweet smile, looking up at the quiet noon sky as they went down the Priory steps, and the lay sister closed the doorbehind them. And now I and now I Oh, when would Clifford pray for her again? When should she master this feeling, strong as death, and far more cruel than the grave, that would not ler. her pray for him--would not let her dwell one moment on his image, without such pangs as these? Her heart answered'sadly, "Never! never!" and she knew that it said the truth. Countess Charlemount she might indeed be, yet Clifford would not be forgotten. Loved, idolized, worshiped; yet not loving in her turn, but always cold and always sad. Was it well that she should act out this dreadful lie  Well that she should stand before the altar, and promise to love and honor one who was no more to her than the earl? Her hand was on the check-string; she was about to yield to the whispered' counsel of her good angel, and to break off, though at the last moment, this marriage whose conditions she could not keep. But a small fiend breathed slyly in her ear. "You would give up all this-and for what? Would Clifford come back to you? Not he! -He loves Helen Erlinford. No doubt he is re- joiced at heart at his escape. When he re- turns and marries her, think what a triumph it will be for him to find you still single, still wretched and for his sake t He despises you now, but then-oh then, ne will despise you more "      '  A passionate sob rose to her lips. "What is it, my darling?" asked Prudence, who had'been watching leer changing face anx- iously.  "Nothing-nothing I Let-me alone! I wish I was dead.-that is all l" and she buried 'her face in her hands' and leaned back in her own corner of the carriage. A few rods more, and they turned into the broad road, and Prudence saw a little Gothic church before them. - The doors were open, and one or two stray'butehevs' boys and serv- , ants, out on errands, having smelt out a wed- ding, were hanging around the porch to see the ibride go in. ': '"My dear," maid Prudence, gently, "we have arrived."          . [  A shudder ran over Regina from head to    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6470-00000059"/> foot, but she saif nothing. 'Oaptain Groaven- or came eagerly forward-to the :oariage-door; he was to give the bride away. As she passed into the vestry, leaning on his 'arm, the butchers' boys stared oddly at each other. "Can't be a wedding, can it, Bill?" said one, dubiously. '  And the other replied, "Liker a funeral, I should say-only I can't see no corpse." Re- gina heard him, and gave a dreary smile. At that moment there seemed so little life or hope within her, that she might almost as fitly lie down within a coffin as upon-a bridal couch.  The clergyman, who was quite a young'man, seemed terribly afraid of:the tall, beautiful wo- man, who looked at him so gravely out of. her dark eyes. To him, the match was everything that was imprudent and terrible; and he had only been won over to play his part in it by the entreaty of the earl in person. He evi- dently looked upon the actress as a kind of' sorceress, and trembled under 'her glance as a bird would tremble before a serpent about to charm it to its death. His embarrassment only: added to that of the party before him, and they placed themselves so awkwardly at the altar, that, but for Tom Groevenor's presence of mind, Prudence would have been the Coun- tess of Charlemount, instead of her young mis- tress. The ceremony began when this little mistake had been rectified, and the earl grew more composed on stealing a glance round the church, and seeing no accusing face looking down on him from organ-loft or gallery. All was safe, so far as his poor young victim was: concerned.  He made his responses in a clear, low voie, and with deep feeling. Regina looked like one in &amp; dream. Not once did her eyes meet his- not once did she touch him as they knelt or stood side by side. He felt that her heart was Or away-he knew, instinctively, where I When , he took her hand, itwas cold as ice. 'She start- ed, and looked curiously at the ring eliding down upon her finger, and half drew back her hand. But he -held it firmly; his own were hot and trembling, and his cheeks were flushed, and his eyes burning with b strange light. The blessingwas pronounced; they walked down the aisle, and the slight hand Was resting on his arm. Tom Grosvenor escorted them with a smiling fae to sign their names in the ves-   try. The olergyman,- having divested himselt of his surplice; came round to shake Charle- mount-by the hand, and wish him joy. He did it with an air of protest; and addressing Regina by her new title, roused her from the reverie into which she had fallen. She looked at her husband. "At last!" he said, with a smile-' at last -Countess of Charlemount 1" and bending fondly over her, he pressed his lips to hers. They grew cold beneath his own-she hap fainted in his arms I "She is dead!" cried out the terrified cler- gyman. "She is ill, idiot!" answered Tom Grosven- or, irreverently; and taking up a glass of wa- ter on the window-ledge, he brought it to his friend, and Charlemount sprinkled a little upon her face. His own was almost as white, as she opened her eyes and looked up at him. "What is it, my lord?" "You were ill, love I Are you better now?" "Yes--better. Where is Prudence?" "Here, beside you." "Ah, I remember!" she said, gazing round the room. "I remember it all now. Let Pru- dence take me home."   : "She shall go with us, my love." "'No I alone . alone!" murmured Regroa. struggling out of his arms, and clingingto her nurse. "I am not well yet, my lord I will go back with her .as I came." "As you like," said Charlemount, offering her his arm. "Captain Grosvenor will go with me. Shall'we follow you at once, or--? He hesitated. "Give me an hour's rest, my lord," said Re. gina,;faintly. "I shall bl able to begin our journey then." He led her to her own brougham, and saw her seated with Prudence beside her. ' My love, if you wish to defer our journey for a day or two I will go t once, and tele- graph to Paris." "Oh, no-let us go to-day-at the time named. .1 shall be quite well enough-rquite." "Jn an hour's time, then, expect meat the cottage. Take good care ofher, Prudence; and if she continues it, tell me when I come. If she is better, have all in readiness, so that  we may start on the instant. Regina V" "Yes, my lord."   ,H ere is your glove." As he placed it in her hand, he bent down and kissed the wedding-ring he had just placed there. ' The carriage whirled away, and he went back into the vestry. The Reverend Clarence Howard shook hands with him once more as he said good-bye, but evidently re- garded him with the eyes of pity. Captain Grosvenor waited while he gave orders to his coachman, and then followed him into the brougham, which was driven by the faithful Roberts, for that morning.  "The carriage will go back to the cottage, Roberts," said the earl. "And you may drive to the park." They had got far down the High street, in Kensington, before either of the occupants of the brougham spoke. Charlemount turned, at last, to his companion, who was intently studying the varnished tops of his patent- leather boots. "' Well, Tom!" "Well, George!" "What do you think about it all?" "Do you really want me to say?" "Of course'!" "It's a very delicate subject!" "Out with it!" '"lt is the. doose's own delight, then!" said Captain Tom,very profoundly. "By heaven! I think you are right!" groan- ed poor Charlemount. "Still, you have many things on your side. And one is, that she is yours at last. I give you joy, fy dear fellow 1" They shiolkhands silently. "Do you think' she will ever love me, Tom? "Of course! Women always do, after they are once married. ' But I confess, I have been afraid she would slip through your fingers'all this while. You have played a bold' game for her; you deserved to win, and I am glad you have." "She was thinking of him all the while " cried out the earl, biting his moustache. "I saw it in her face; aid, by heaven, I was so miserable, at one time, that I hAl a great mind to say; "Here, my dear-I will set you free, even now,. if you like I' What if I had, Tom?" "You would have been a fool for your   pains. There is hot such; another obuntess in the United'Kingdo  ,' "I know it H know  it!" replied peea Charlemount, with a' heavy sigh. ia And she mdist love 'm. by-ld-by, I 'will be so kind to her that she Cannot help it. Hang that Clif- ford 1" "There, never mind him now. He is out of the way, that is one comfort. Where do you go first?" "To Paris." "You gave her the letter from Ruth, to. day?" ' "Yes." She suspected nothing?" "Nothing!" "That fellow of yours has the head of a prime minister. He has managed this busineme splendidly. He is very faitfhful, is he not!" ' "Oh, very!" "Where id he now?"  "At home, I are say. We will drive down and see. We have plenty of time, aud T hard- ly think he would go out to the eottaee with. - out getting a message from me.  Roberts, homne i" "What *ill you do with Ruth?" "He. will think of some plan after we are safely off. I can only think of one thing now, and that is Regina." ' But she expects to meet her in Paris I1" "Trie!"  "How will' you iianage that?"' "Howe has already done it. Letterse are awaiting the Countess of Charlemount, there, at this moment, to inform her that my brother Harry has been suddenly called to Germany, on business; but that' they will meet us id Rome. Once on the Continent, it is an eaev thing to aec6uhtfifbr missing friends; and il a year or two she will forget Ruth, I trust, and be content with' your humble servait." "What if I fill, your place with Ruth, George?"- -  "You are welcome.", "She was a beautiful creature!" "' Yes, to one who has not known, and loved, a Regina'!" "Gentle, I suppose, and affeCtionate?" ; Y. "You have jist described her-.a natur all    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6470-00000060"/> honey and sweetness. She is like a spaniel- ' the more harshly you treat her, the more she fawns upon you." "How bitter you are!" "Not at all. I am only telling you the truth. I dare say you will like'hor the better for it. Give me more spirit!" "You have got it!" said Tom, briefly. "Yes. The Countess of Charlemount is made. of different materials from that poor lit- tle girl. If Ruth had been like her, she would have been with me to-day." - "* I wonder what they have done with the poor little devil?" "A friend of Howe's has taken charge of her till we are off. You will get her address, if they have removed her, at Wilverton Cot- tage, in -- shire.' "Thank you I I shall be going down into the country to-morrow, and will try my hand at consoling her. But I say, Charlemount, what is all that row about?" They were just turning into Park Lane, when a crowd in the street interrupted their prog- ress. Charlemount looked out, and saw a fe- male figure wrapped in a torn and dingy gray loak, and surrounded by a ring of boys, who were hooting and jeering at her. "A drunken woman, Tom, that is all! Go on, Roberts! I wonder where the policeman can be?" "Drunk? I hardly think it. Ah, you coward, would you!" and darting from the carriage, Captain Grosvenor pounced upon an unhappy newsboy who had tried to trip up the poor crealture as she ran wildly to and fro among her tormentors. Charlemount followed him, more to protect his retreat than to join in the threatened melee. "Here comes two swells!" cried out a young butcher, with a shiny face. "Wonder if they'll ask the lady into the carriage 1" i"I'll punch your head for you, you booby, in two minutes!" cried Tom Grosvenor, hot- ly; at which the butcher put down his bas- ket, rolled up his sleeves, and throwing him- self into a boxing attitude, begged the captain "just to come on, and get the best whopping he ever had in his life!" "Pshawl" cried the earl, grasping his   friend's arm; " don't get into a scrape here, Totm The police will be up in a few mo- ments. What is the matter with this woman, my friends?" "'She's got out of the wrong side of the bed, that's all 1" cried one. "Too 'arly!" added another. "Been imbibing the rosy-making acquaint- anee with the ardent!" said a third, imitating the action of drinking, with great applause." "I think not." Charlemount went a step or two nearer, and, looking over the heads of his neighbors, said? ';What is the matter with you, my poor woman? Can I do anything to help you?" At the sound of his voice, the bent figure raised itself suddenly, and a white face, lit up with a pair of wild brown eyes, was turned to ward him. He started back. "My God, Tom I can it be?" Ah, you have come!" she cried, running toward him, and showing a simple muslin robe under her thick cloak as she threw up her arms. "I knew you would come, Georgy I' 4( Here comes the police!" cried out an ur- chin on the outskirts of the crown. "' Good Heaven, Tom I help me to take her to the carriage I Quick! Here, Roberts, lend a helping hand  Stand at the horses' head, my men I Quick, quick!-the policeman i almost here." The girl was clinging to him, with her arms around his neck, as he spoke; he hurried her into the carriage, and sprang in after her, just as X 156 came panting and puffing up through the gaping crowd. He looked into the window with an air of authority, but recognizing the earl, touched his hat very politely. "All right, my lord?" "Quite right! A family affair, that is all! Tell the man to drive home. Thank you, my friends!" The blinds were pulled down with a jerk, and the carriage whirled away. The people dispersed, wondering much what the strange and sudden scene could mean. The earl sat pale as death'in one corner of the carriage, Ruth'cowered in another, and Tom Grosvenor, surveying them both, relieved his overcharged feelings now and then by a suppressed oath   CHAPTER XLI "Oh, false of heart and false of soul!-oh thou so weak and poor In all that, giving love, insures the sweet return of more! How could I stoop to. raise thee up to my own higher sphere? How could I wrong my womanhood by making thee so dear? Go to! I am no prophetess, and yet I can but say Wh even my slight skill discerns within thy future day; How wrong, and shame, and vain remorse will rise to break thy rest, And ghosts of all thy broken vows wail requiems on thy breast!"-M. B. It is an amusing thing to " sow wild oats"; but when it comes to the gathering in of the crops, the business is by no imeans so pleasant. We have all probably learnt this in a greater or less degree. The crop always springs up, too, at the wrong times, and in the wrong places; and the very people, of all others, from whom we wish to keep certain little proceedings se- cret, are generally the ones to witness the har- vesting; and then we cut such contemptible figures, and watch our cherished plans for the future tumbling to the ground (merely through this mishap) with such foolish as well as rue- ful faces I Believe me, it is very much better- even in a perfectly worldly point of view-to keep a clear conscience always, and so have no "harvest homes" 'to which we cannot invite our nearest and dearest with rejoicing Jhearts. The poor earl was in a most ludicrous. posi- tion, though, I dare say, he could see nothing very funny in it. He had married Madelaine Laboune, it is tri e; but what was to hinder her from unmarrying herself, or, at least, or- dering him out of the house very speedily, when Ruth had told her tale? The trick of the garden window, also, would be exposed, and Clifford summoned back, when-if the earl refused to apply for a divorce, or to grant one, she would very probably go and live with the idiot, merely to revenge herself on him. "I ish to Heaven there were not a woman in the world!" he groaned within himself, as he eyed the silent, wild-looking Ruth. You see, like most-or, rather, like all-men, he visited his own sins on the head of his vic- tim, and was cursing her in his heart. simply because she had been deceived by him, and so brought matters to this pretty pass I 'Not a word was spoken among those three till the carriage drew up at a private door in a little lane near Charlemount House. Roberts, in spite of his surprise, had his wits about him, and preferred disembarking his queer cargo at this mysterious entrance, which led to some very beautiful supper-rooms and saloons, in the gardens of the mansion. Nany a beau- tifuil woman had tripped through that plain little door-nay, Ruth herself had entered it more than once, although she did not seem to recognize it now, A bell pealed faintly far   away, as Roberts pulled a handle near the door, and after a minute or two it opened slowly, and the pale face of Howe looked out. "What is it?" he asked. "As nice a mess, my man, as jver you see in all your born days," eaid Roberts, 8otto oce -and then going to the carria,e door, he opened it, and stood waiting for orders. The earl sprang out first, in spite of a scream from Ruth, who grasped his coat frantically (. detain him. Seeing Howe, he rushed up to, him, seized him by the neckoloth, and shook him till he was nearly black in the face. "You villain! how dare you come before me, after-after that?" he cried, pointing to the trembling girl. ' Howe's face grew livid as he shook himseli free from his master's hold. "My lord, I can explain it all. H eame up by a spepial train, on purpose." "* Oh, you did? I am very much obliged to you. Tom, my good fellow, will you take charge of her while I talk to him? Take her 4o the library. Roberts will show you the way, and we will stand near the horses till he comes back. Confound you! can't you keep your tongue between your teeth now? he added, savagely, to Ruth. "Do you want to have the police down upon me, you curse?" "O George-George!" "Yes, it is George, sure enough. For Heaven's sake, take her away, Tom, or I shall murder her!' "Come, my dear," said the captain, shoth. ingly; and, scared and wretched, Ruth let him lead her away. "Now, sir, how did all this happen?"'said Charlemount, turning to Howe. t My lord, I went down to the cottage, as you told me." "Be quick I Do youknow that my wife"- he laughed bitterly-"is wai ing for Dme at'- Brompton!" "You are married I She did not interrupt the service?"  "I should think not!" cried the earl, with a dreadful oath. You would never have seen her here alive, if she had done that!" "My lord, I hope you will allow me to wish you joy!"And the man bowed profoundly. "Confound it Go on with your story. It appears to me that there is very little joy in prospect just now. How came you both here in London?" "I will tell you. Mrs. Maining had every- thing in readiness when I got down there; and Ruth went into those rooms that I told you of last week, without suspecting anything. When she was safe, the story came out." "Did you tell her everything?" Only that you were to be married." "But not the lady's name?" asked- Charle, mount, quickly.  s ;     <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6470-00000061"/> 'Of course not, my lord. I do not think - she has the slightest idea of it." "' That is well. Go on. How did she take the new,?" "Raved and cried, my lord." "Of course. Anything else?" "She vowed she would come and beg you not to desert her. Then she ran into all the rooms, and when she found she could not aet out., she screamed for help." "Well?" ' 1 told her she might as well keep hei breath for better purposes, since the villagers all be- lieved her muad." 'Do they believe it?" "Every one of them. And as she has no friends or relatives, to make a hue-and-cry after her, it will be the easiest thing on earth to take her back again." "Yes-especially if you take as good care of her as you have this time!" was the sarcas- tic reply. "did my best, my lord," said Howe. "Then how did she come here to-day?" "Well, you see, she was like a mad woman, after I told her this So I left her for a little while. I was going'to s-e her again that night before I left. I dined with Mrs. Maining, in time for the train I wished to catch, and then went up to her room." "What dlid she say then?" "My lord. she was not there." "What! She got away under your very nose, while you were in the house 9" "'es. my lord!" "By Joe, sir, you ought to be sent to the Tower, or to the whipping. post!" cried the earl. 4"A boy, six years old, would be ashamed of such folly!" "Indeed, my lord, I hardly see how you can blame me. I left her shut up, without door or window that she could open; and when I got, back, what do you think she had done?" "How should I know?" ", Taken the sheets from the bed-room, and torn them in strips-" "And braided a rope, etc., etc. I know all about it, Howe. I have read a thousand such stories, in old novels. But what could she do with a rope-ladder, if she could not get the window open?"  4 She broke the glass, my lord, and raised it. There was blood all over the panes." "But the bars, idiot?" "Ah, the bars I Much good they did! The mortar had not hardened, and the workmen were fools. The consequence was, that, with a good wrench or two, she had one of them off, and slipped out through the place like an eel, tied the ladder to thN sill, and swung herself down. It was dark, and no one saw her; but when we came to make inquiries, the child at ihe lodge had cried itself into convulsions, be- cause, it said, a ghost came into the kitchen,   and took its mother* cloak' off the nail, and ran away down the road with it." "It was Ruth?" "Yes, my lord." "Why did you not follow her.?" "I came at once; but she must hav'e had an hour's start; for though I tracked her on the line, her train was in long before ours. I have been looking forg er ever since in town, and only came home, dead-beat, about a quarter of an hour before you, my lord. May I ask where you found her?' "In 'Park Lane. She was doing tragedy business to a select audience of butchers and pot-boys," groaned the earl. "And when she saw me, she flung her arms around my neck, and called me ' Georgy' before them all! It is  a sweet affair, take it on all sides! What shall we do with her? How in the fiend's name can I face Regina, till she is disposed of? I shall go mad!" Howe considered. On the one hand, it would be difficult to get Ruth away, or, at least, to. manage her when she was away, till she had heard from Charlemount's own lips that he loved another. On the other, if by any means she let slip Regina's name, there was trouble in store for him. "' Here cobnme Roberts," said the earl, look- ing toward the house. "And there goes the quarter-no, the half-hour! What am I to do?" * "I should see her, my lord." "I am going to." "And tell her the truth.'" "That would only be tod halke bad wor6e." "I think it would make bad better." "Tell her yourself, then." "She would not believe it.' Her faithin me must be pretty well shakeh by this time, However, it you think it will do any good-. Here, Roberts!"' t"Yes, my ldrd." "You need not put the horses, up. rive out to Brompton, and say to her ladyship., that. I may be detained for a few' moments, arid that. if she is well enough, we shall be obliged to start as soon as I arrive. I will ride out."' Roberts touched his hat. exchanged a look with Howe behind the earl's back, and mount- ed the box. They stood watching him as he drove away. "A pleasant wedding-morning this is!" groaned Charlemount. "Come, Howe--you shall go with me, and see this she-devil!' "My lord, may I propose a plan?" "Yes," "We shall perhaps have some difficulty in getting her away" "I believe you." "What if we drug her?" "The beet thing we can do I And yet, I don't know--I am afraid she will be too wise for us."   "Not a bit of it! Let me slip into the din- ing-room; and put a little laudanum into a glass of iine-then you can see her there-get her t. drink it the first thing, and she will be sleep- iog like a baby when you go," "Laudanum-no, I don't like that!  We might make some blunder, and I don't want to, kill the poor wretch, though I felt as if I could do it, when I first saw her to-day I But I have u drug which is perfectly safe, and much speed- I-r. I will put it into the wine myself. Go i'l o the library, and when you hear the bell, br'ng her into the pink saloon." H ,we waited at the library door till the bell rang. Then he entered. Ruth sprang up from the couch on which she had thrown herself, and ran toward him. "Oh, have you come from him? 'Will he see me?"  Howe bowed, and held the door open for her to pass out. Captain Grosvenoi had established himself with a cigar and a book at the window, and scarcely looked up as they went away. "Mind, now," said the man, in a low voice, before they reached the saloon, "if you men-, tion Regina's name, he will never see you again." 7"Did he say so?" she asked, with a bewil- dered look. "Yes." 4' Then I will not." The next moment, she saw Charlemount standing at the window, with his face averted from her. The sudden shock of Howe's news, and the anguish she had endured during that night, wandering about the streets of London, had gone very far to shake her reason; but she still remembered that she loved him, and that he was angry-that he had deserted her' just when she thought herself most secure in his love. She ran forward with a-bitter cry: "O George--George I how could you be so cruel?" and sank down at his feet, embracing his lknees, and looking up with; streaming eyes into his btern face. "Get up. Ruth," he said, coldly. She obeyed. "Now, why have you come here?" "Why? To find you, George," she said, with tears. "They told me that you were go- ing away." "So I am." "And that you were geing to leave me be- hind." "They were quite right." "Oh, no, you cannot do it?You don't know how I love you, George I You don't know how miserable it makes the to hear them say such things. I will not trouble you if I go. I will not speak to you exce pt when you give me leave. Do take me with you, George '." -  He was looking at her very steadily. For the first time, the thought crossed his mind   that she was' mad. If that were the case, all was safe. But some' remorse, at, his own share in the eatastrophe made him speak to her in a gentler tone. ' \  "Ruth, what else did they tell you about me?"' "That you were going to be married, George; but that I cannot believe," she added, with a faint smile, ', That would be worse than all the rest." "-What would you do if it were true?"  "She looked at him a moment and then said, as she did once before in the green lane at Brompton: "Die!"  "Psha!" ' '"Are you angry, George?" "No." "Why do you look at me so, then?" He glanced at his watch, and turded impa tiently away. "Ruth, I must go." "Take me with you." "I can't. Don't cling to me like thatl Con found it, woman," he cried, desperately, "if you will know everything, will tell you. I am married already l" "Married?" "Yes-this morning; and I must be off out of this cursed country in an hour's time. Now, are you satisfied? now, will you go? Here, Howe! Help!" He caught her' in his arms as she was fall- ing, and rang the bell furiously. Howe en tered. "Howe, what ails her'?" "She has fainted, my lord." "FaintedI The Countess of Charlemount fainted when Ikissed her at the church," he mut- tered; " and now this fdol faints because I don't kiss her! This is the second lady I have had the honor of holding in my arms this morning. Howe, get some water."         \ "She is coming to already. Would it not be a good time to give her the wine, my lord?" "That's a capital idea. Where is it?" \ Howe took the glass from the mantelpiece and put it in his hand. Ruth opened her eyes. "Here--drink this She pushed the glass away, and tried to rise. "Drink it, I tell you! Drink it, Ruth, for my sake  It will do you good," lie added, changing his tone. And she put her lips to the glass, and drank the wine at once..  "That is a good girl. Now let me put you on the sofa. You are not fit to sit up yet." "Married!" she whispered, as he laid her down.  "You did,not mean. it, did you George?" '"Let me arrange your pillows. You look tired. There!" The drug was working fast. Thle wide open brown eyes began to elOse, But she kept her arms around his necks as he knelt beside her.    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6470-00000062"/> "I am sleepy. Kiss me good-night, George, as you used to do. I know you did not mean it."  He obeyed. A happy smile played around the lips he pressed-a rosy flush tinged her cheek-her clasp relaxed; and as he rose to his feet, she nestled down among the pillows, like a tired child, and slept. He stood and looked down at her a moment, and sighed deeply. i By Heaven, I have been the greatest vil- lain that ever drew breath, to you, poor little Ruthl Well, good-bye! This business is the worst of all. Howe, they will be kind to her?" "* Mrs. Maining is all kindness, my lord." "I it safe to leave her, then?" "Quite, my lord." "And you-will you stay, or go with us?" "I shall never, willingly, leave you, my lord." Nor would I willingly part with you, my good friend." The earl stretched out his hand. Howe bent down and kissed it; but a sinister smile played round his lips as he did so. "You will take her to Wilverton at once. Then follow us direct to Paris. We will wait one day for you. See that she is safe-bring me good tidings of her." "I will, my lord." "But don't delay too long. Good heavens, what a business this has been!" ' It is all over now, my lord." ' I hope so. Good-bye, Howe!" 4 Good-bye, my lord!" He held the door open for his master, and watched him mount his horse at the door, and dash down the square at such a pace that the groom could hardly keep up with him. Then, coming back, he stood and gazed at the sleep- ing Ruth. "Countess of Charlemount '" he said, with a malicious grin. "' I shall tell you another tale one day, my lord. And I have one thing more to set down to the credit side of your account with me. It will be a pleasant reckoning when it comes!" *    *     .   *    * The earl looked. pale, and worn, and ill, when he reached the cottage, and threw his bridle-rein to Roberts, who was waiting at the gate. "My good fellow," he said, if you have any adieux to make, be quick about them, for we shall te off in half an hour, at the latest." Roberts had none, he answered, respectfully. "You are a lucky fellow!" said poor Char- lemount, with a sigh, as he strode through/the hall and entered the study, where Regina was sitting. She looked up, and colored a little, as he came forward and took her hand. "Are you better, love?" he asked. "I am quite well now, my lord." * Do not give me that cold title. Cannot I teach you to say George?"   It is an easy name to speak." "Tet me hear it, then, from your lips." "George." She said it quietly, and somewhat coldly- -not at Ruth had often spoken it. He sat down beside her. "Are all your preparations made?" "Nearly. I think Prudence is packing Prince Charlie into his traveling-box. He has a strong objection to occupying it. As for Peter, he is quite outrageous at the indignity they have put upon him by confining him to lis cage. Dick is of a milder temper. When I showed him the nice bed of lambs'-wool I had prepared in his hamper, he curled himself up in the middle of it without a word, and is sleeping the sleep of the just, now. Poor things! I hope they will not be sea-sick." "And where is Saladin?" !"At the station, by this time, with his groom. He is too gentlemanly to object to umy plan I may form for his good. I never have any trouble with him in my forced marches!" "You are used to them, then?" "Oh, yes-this is by no means the first. In America, I often used to overturn; my house- hold, and be off for a month's trip across the prairies, at two hours' notice." "You have given us a longer one!" He took her hand-there was no more re- sistance now--it lay quietly enough in hie clasp. "By-the-way, Regina, I have a diamond guard for you-the same you had before, but it is smaller now." "* Have you?" He produced itfrom his vest-pocket, slipped it upon her finger, and looked at it with a smile. "Diamonds are suited to you, my love; and the Erlinford diamonds are very fine. When'  you go to court-" R gina flushed up a little. "My lord, ou are dreaming I I shall never go to court. "Abroad, love-not here. We shall not be in England this long while, unless you wish it." "I do not." "I thought of living in Italy. Would that suit you? ' Perfectly." "Because, you snow, you have only to say the word.' I would live on Mount Caucasus, if it were your wish." She laughed good-naturedly. ". I see you do not believe me." "I dare say you feel it all just now. But wait a year or two, and you will see how dif- ferently Mount Caucasus. and Lady Charle- mount will appear in your eyes!" Ah I how little you understand me I How little you know what tortures I suffered before I won you I How little you imagine all I have dared to call you mine How little you see that all the misery on earth would be met ty me gladly, if, at the end, I could come aioI sit   beside you, as I am sitting now-hold your' hand in mine--and rest my tired, aching head here V" It dropped as he spoke, till it rested on her bosom. A crimson flush rose to her forehead, and he felt her heart beat quicker, beneath his cheek. "* If you would only pay me back one tithe of the love and the passion I have for you!" 'e murmured. She did not answer. ** Am I never going to be dear to you?" "You are now i' "Not in the way I mean " *"Give me time, then," she-said, in a low voice,obending over him till her warm breath fanned her cheek. "If I had not felt that I could be a very true and a very faithful friend to you, I would not have 'gone with you to- day. ' *Well, to have you, even as a friend, is something; and I do not despair of bringing you still nearer, my dear, dear wife!" 1"Hark! there is a knock I Sit up, Charle- mount." He obeyed, and Prudence entered, clad in a traveling-dress, and carrying a- huge basket. "Regina-I beg your pardon-my lady 1" "Don't be a goose, Prudence! I am always Regina to you. What do you want to say?" * Ever) thing is ready." "Very well. And you?" "* I am ready, too." "Ah, you have not forgotten your old train- ing I It is my belief you would start to Nova Zembla with the greatest cheerfulness, if I told you we were going five minutes before- hand. Do you know, Prudence, that I am very hungry? Are not you, my lord?" "H don't know!" - "Allow me to find out for you! Do give me something to eat, Prudence, before we go. What do the servants say at being discharged?" "1 Nothing, Regina. How should they, when they are so liberally paid?" "And Eliza is willing to remain in charge of the premises?" Quite."  "Who is Eliza?" asked the earl. A kind of sub-housekeeper. I am going to leave the house in her care." .  Is it yours? Did you buy it?" 'Of course. *Did 1 not tell you so when I spoke of giving it to Ruth?" "To Ruth?" "Yes. She may want it one day, if she does not now-especially as your brother is not very rich. It will do for a town-house for them, will it not?" "Eh? Oh, yes-most certainly!" stammer- ed Charlemount. "If you think it is not good enough, you may give them a better one when we all come back tagain. Now, Prudence, the luncheon, please!"           ,   It was brought, and Charlemount sat down to his first meal with Regina. He could scarce- ly believe himself awake. Even she seemed half amused with the oddity of the' thing, as she handed him his cup of chocolate. "For two people who were utter strangers three months ago, I think we have gone on, remarkably well," she said, with an arch smile. "I little thought, when I took my breakfast this morning, that I should make my next meal with a wedding-ring on my hand, and a coronet on my head. I fancy, not another wo. man in the world would have married you in such an odd fashion, George! ' "Regina, you are an angel!" he cried, enthu- siastically. "Do angels eat cold tongue? Because there s some at your elbow, that looks particularly inviting." "If you only knew how happy I feel " he said, as he helped her. "I am not very miserable myself, just at present!" 'a Are you not? Do you really think you can get on with me, Regina I would die to make you happy!" "It is not necessary," said Regina, whose old gayety seemed, coming back, now that her destiny was actually decided. "Don't squeeze my hand; and how am I to eat as much as I like, if you sit looking at me? Lord Byron never liked to see a lady eat. I dare say you are just like him in that respect." "Lord Byron was an idiot 1" "Take care! In the 'days when I used to study Latin, I remember a. pithy sentence: 'That nothing but good was-to be spoken of the dead' ." "Do you know Latin? How clever you are 1" He said it so sincerely, that she burst out laughing. "And what a sweet laugh you have! When I war in America, I used to drive a sleigh, through the winter months, and those bells that my horses wore rang out just as your laugh does." "I hope the bells were not cracked 1" "How can you say such a thing?" "I wish I had a glass of wine." "I will go and get you one." And he sprang up from his chair. "Where shall I look for it?" "I thought you would have to come to me for information. Touch the bell, and ask Prudence to bring a bottle of golden sherry, while I run and put on my hat. I may travel in a hat, may I not? Because I will not wear a bonnet, except when I am obliged; and if you condemn me to one now, I will stay at, home." "My love, if you wish to wear my beaver, I shall make no objection. Wear what you like, and do wfat you like, and I shall always be pleased.    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6470-00000063"/> "You are a charming man!" she said, laugh- ing, as she ran up-stairs. Prudence, coming with the wine, and finding him alone, took the opportunity of disburden- ing her mind a little. * My lord, you must let me wish you joy!" "With all my heart, my good friend I And drink my health and hers!" He poured out a glass of sherry. It was a wine on which Regina particularly prided her- self, and a delicious, nutty odor filled the whole apartment as soon as the bottle was un- corked. "t is a happy day for me!" said Prudence, rml1king a profound reverence to him, as she lifted the glass to her lips, which he returned by a gallant bow. "I never liked Mr. Clifford's ways with her, my lord!" "'Why not?' "He was too haughty-v-too overbearing  They would have quarreled in a week, if she had married him " "I do not doubt it." "And then she cared too much for him." "Ah!" The earl winced. Prudence saw she had made an unlucky blunder, and quietly changed the subject. "' I think you will be kind to her, my lord." "It will be the study of my life to make her happy. I only wish she may learn to care for me." "She cares for you now," said Prudence. He looked at her with delighted eyes. * Do you really think so? ' "I know it, my lord. You have one ad- vantage over any other person." "What is that?" "You are my master's brother."  "Do you think it makes a difference?" "1 am sure of it. And you must not mind her being a little cold and quiet at-times. It is her why. She was always so from a child. She has got back her old, bright smiles againi and-I will attend to it directly, my lord 1" Charlemount, who had been gazing medita- tively on the floor, looked up in utter surprise at this strange ending of the good old 'woman's speech. The mystery was explained by the entrance of Regina, whom Prudence had al- ready seen upon the stairs. She wore a black mantle and a Spanish hat, whose dusky plumes touched her shoulder. "Where is my wine?" she asked. "Pru- dence, will you give Prince Charlie a saucer of milk before we go 9 I am sure the poor little fellow is thirsty; he is yelping in his hamper as if his heart was broken!" "It is nothing 'but his temper!" said Pru- dence, as she bustled off to execute the com- mission, and to stow the rebellious traveler snugly away in his own carriage, before he got sight of his mistress entering hers. ' "Only temper I I dare say that is all that ails most of us. half the time!" said Regina,   taking the glass of sherry her husband gave her. "To your health, my lord-that is, George!" He pledged her-in another glass. "Now we are ready; I have said good-bye to the servants. They are in such a state of awe and admiration at seeing a live countess! Do I look like a countess, I wonder?"And she glanced at herself in the glass, "You look like a queen, my beautiful!- and, for your sake, I wish I could have mnade you one." "Thank you-- infinitely prefer being what I am. There is no one I pity more than kings and queens. Poor things! I would not live 'their lives for the world! What a bore every- thing must be to them! Come-one look at the room-dear little room! By the way, where is Howe?" "What in the world do you want of him?", asked the earl, coloring violently. "Why, how you blush   What mischief have you sent him about?" "None, on my honor! But why do you wish to see him?" "I don't like trusting my pets to any one else. You said he was so careful." ' So he is. But Robert is very careful, too; and Howe will join us in Paris the day after we get there. He has stopped to-attend to-to a little business for me." At this somewhat em arrassing juncture, Prudence put her head in a the door. * "My dear, I am afraid we ought not to wait any longer. We have only time to catch the train, the servants say." "Well, I am ready," said Regina. She gave one wistful look around the familiar room, and went out, leaning on Charlemount's arm. The servants gathered around the gate, and uttered 'their simple good wishes as she entered the'carriage. She leaned forward and smiled her adieu; then the brougham, holding Prudence and her charges, dashed off-their own followed moe .slowly; and Oharlemount's arm drew her fondly to his side. --"My own dear wife 1" he said; and some- thing in his tone and look took away much of -the bitterness of her last faiewell to the home which had been so happy, and the hones and dreams she had cherished there t *   *   s*   * Five years had passed away. In that time, nsiny changes had taken place among those of whom I have written. Hearts that bled bad stanched their wounds-hearth that loved would love no longer-hearts that suffered were at rest. In the garden of the Wilverton cottage was a lonely grave. Regina knew who was lying there, but not how or why she died. And while she mourned with a faithful sadness fbr the dear friend of the old, happy time, and shed some silent tears upon her pillow when the thought of Ruth came suddenly before her, she little dreamed from what hand the blow   had fallen, or that he who slumbered so tran- I quilly beside her had hunted the poor child down to that last kind refuge for earth's weari- est souls I The Earl and Countess of Charlemount were at last in London; anddit was the height of the season. 'The countess was not "presented," it is true; but that did not Heep people from receiving her very gladly at their own houses. If she Lad been a poor man's wife, "society " would have shrugged its shoulders and passed by on the other side; but the coronet on her stately head dazzled society's eyes to such an extent that they quite overlooked her early error. There were many different opipions express- ed about Regina. The young men raved about her beauty; but the coolness of her manner, and the scornful glances of her dark-gray eyes, deterred them from approaching too closely to their divinity. They had a dim consciousness, in spite of their thick arm',r of self-c. nceit. that she secretly despised them-that their vapid common-places wearied her-while their compliments made her long to laugh in their faces, only that courtesy forbade. The women tore her character to tatters when she first appeared among them, because they were afraid their own fascinations might be less than hers; but when it was observed that she tried to make no conquests, and that it was evidently the same to her whether old Colonel Hunter, of the 97th, or young Lieutenant How- ard, of the Guards, leaned over her chair, or led her to the supper-rooms, they pieced up their work with marvelous dexterity, and spoke of her only in the highest terms. She was a devoted wife, they averred-any one could sed thakby watching her when Lord Charlemount was in the room; she was the best of mothers -indeed, her love for the little Lord Erlinford 'was something wonderful-these kind young ladies said. As if every woman did not love her child, from the poor Irish washerwoman in a damp-cellar, to the queen upon her glitter- ing throne! One young lady, indeed, took no share either in the scandal or the chorus of praise, but, for certain reasons of ltr own, she watched Regina 'pretty closely. To her, possibly, was known the secret of a somewhat melancholy expres- sion in the beautiful eyes of the countess. At least, she fancied so; and a little sad look al- ways stole over her own fair face when those eyes chanced to turn ier way. She had spoken often with the woman Clifford had loved-she had held the white hand in hers-that hand which he had held, and to which his lips, no doubt, had been often pressed. There was a free-masonry between the two. There always is between two women who love, or have loved, the same man; and if one has nothing better to do, it is a curious and amusing thing to watch the workings of this unacknowledged feeling, when we stumble upon it here and o   there. Helen and Regina talked, sometimes, of foreign cities-of things they had seen abroad-of the people they met day after day and night after night, in the gay world; nay, they had even spoken of the stage-of -Re- gina's triumphs there, and of the sad fate ot poor Ruth. Only one name was-unmentioned. But when these little talks were over, Regina's eyes would linger one moment, ere she went away, on Helen's face, and Helen's eyes would  droop, while a blush rose to her cheek; aBd they understood each other without a word. "I have lost him, and I would not win 0iln again if I could; but he will come back to you!" said the dark-gray eyes. "Alas! you mistake him; he never loved any one but you!" replied the blue ones. Once they. had spoken of Regina's debit, and of the white roses Helen flung; \but both dropped the abject hastily. They felt it was a dangerous one, andt began to talk of the little Lord Erlinford. Tce mother's heart took refuge from the hitter and humiliating past in tender thoughts of her boy I On a pleasant evenin in May, the Dowager Countess of H--- received her guests. Every one liked to come to her dinners or her par- ties. She was the keenest and wittiest (and, some people added, wickedest) old lady in Europe, and assembled all the nost agreeable people in her rooms; without .distinction of. rank. She was given to " lions," too, and celebrities of every kind were to be met with in her saloons. Captpin Grosvenor and. some of his brother wags christened H -- House "The Exhibition," and nicknamed her lady- ship "Madame Toussaud;" yet they were very glad to receive a card from her, and to inspect the " waxwork" as often as she allowed them to do so. Regina never missed one of her' nights-neither did Mrs. Erlinford; but she went simply because other people did; and took her daughter with. her, because the young earl was a. widower, and admired fair beauties above all others. So it happened that, on this evening, these three ladies were present, and Lord Charlemount had promised to look in at a later hour, and escort Regina to another party. Helen Erlinford sat near her hostess, lieten- ing to the arrivals, and looking quietly around the crowded room. At last two names were announced, and one of them made her heart stand still.  "Mr. Halkyn and Mr. Clifford!" A buzz and rumor ran: round the room. The dowager stepped a pace forward to meet her guests; and, as every head was turned :th4a way, Helen had time to recover her compospre, and to try and summon the truant color back into her cheeks. 'Ten minutes passed in in- troductions and eager conversation; then the countess tripped back to her side, 'followed .by a tall, handsome man, somewhat grave-looking, and very quiet in his manners.    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6470-00000064"/> "My dear Miss Erlinford, where are you?" Clifford started as he heard that name. "Oh, I see you I My dear, clever people always ought to, know each other, and so I have brought Mr. Clifford, the great traveler, to see you. You must ask him about the Nile; he will tell you, though I could not, the other day, when you bored me so about it 1" "I am not clever," said Helen, with a little smile, as she held out her hand; "and Mr. Clifford is an old friend of mine. How do you do, Mr. Clifford? I am very glad to see you home again!" Well may some modern writer exclaim: "We are fearfully and wonderfully made- especially women!"Here was this girl, whose dreams and thoughts had been of the wanderer for five weary years, welcoming him as quietly as if he had only left her the day before She had refused three offers for his sake, and now met him with a simple "How d'ye do!"She had cried herself to sleep over him a thousand times-she had suffered for him, what all wo- men must suffer one day or another, if they are foolish enough to love. She had prayed for him-longed for him-waited for him; and look at her, smiling artlessly in his face, and chatting away as gayly and unconcernedly as if he had been her own brother! Some- times, as he roamed about the world, his thoughts had gone back to her, and decked out her image with new grace and beauty. She was fair, she was ppre, she was true; and was it not just possible that she was learning to' love him, after all, instead of Charlemount, when he left her? If he came back, and found her free, would it not be a sign in his favor? and should he not accept it, and try his fate in that direction? The little dream faded as he watched her sparkling face, and he never knew, till that m6ment, how vivid it had been. He sat beside her sadly, and answered her ques- tions with a heavy heart. How was he to know that her own was overflowing with love and tenderness, and trembling 'joy? How was he to guess that, if ha could have seized upon that little gloved hand that fluttered like a bird about the brilliant-hued bouquet in her lap- seized upon it and asked for (after he had secured) the prize, it would have been his? "I And so you went up the Nile, and saw the Pyramids?" cried Helen. "I read all about it in your first book. I like that better than the second." "May I ask why?' "It was fresher. It seemed to me that you got tired even of traveling, at last, and came to look rather scornfully on things you would have admired and loved at first." "Very likely," said Clifford, with a sigh. "I have tired of many things m my time, and traveling is one of them." "Yet you are not such a very old man," was the arch reply.   She had a reason for wishing to get at the bottom of Clifford's ennui. "Not if you count my years, Miss Er'inford. But hearts get gray long before heads, you know." "How exceedingly Byronic!" "Miss Erlinford is pleased to be sarcastic." "Well, I colfess, Mr. Clifford, that such speeches always vex me. It seems such a shame to abuse this' poor old world of ours. If we only took the good it is ready to give us, our hearts would not be gray, I think; it -if--" ' You speak like a young lady," said Clif- ford, smiling, when he saw she would not go on; "f nd like a young lady who has never 'known what suffering means, except from her dictionary. No doubt you find this world a very pleasant place-no doubt you receive much good and much pleasure from it. I do not. And we are both very frank in speaking our minds-I in my book, you here." "There. is nothing like frankness," observee Helen, and she gave him a glance that was puzzling in the extreme. A dim consciousness of some blunder or mistake stole over him. What had it been? "These people evidently do not hold with you," she said, glancing round the room. * How happy they all look!" "Yes, poor things, they are trying very hard to be amused!" "Why did you come back, Mr. Clifford, if we all bore you so?" "Did I say all? I know one who will never bore me." Helen laughed. "I was not asking for a compliment, Mr. Clifford. But, since it suits you to be ' a-weary of the world,' suppose I must leave you in peace, and talk of something else. Do you remember a foolish little song of mine? You admired the words very much, five years ago; it was called 'Leoline.'" "I remember it perfectly, Miss Erlinford. The words were not all that I admired." "Since you have been so short a time in London, perhaps you have not heard that C-- has painted a picture from the poem?" i Has he, indeed?" "It is in the exhibition. You must go and see it. The face of Leoline, as she bends over that ' blue flower in the garden,' is one of the loveliest things I have ever seen." ' I will go and look at it to-morrow. Whit are all those people crowding down near th saloon for, Miss Erlinford?"  Helen hesitated a moment, and then said, in a very low voice: "1 believe they have just become aware of the presence of some one-a lady. I could have told them she was here half an hour ago, for she came up the stairs before us." "And who may this wonderful lady be?" "You used to know her."   "I '" "Very well indeed." "Who is it?" "Don't ask me," said Helen, rather nerv- ously; "but follow them and see. You will wish to pay your respects to her." Clifford turned a little pale. "I think it is some one I do not wish to meet." "Perhaps so. .I should not have told you that she was here, only-" "Prav, make no apology, Miss Erlinford," he said, kindly. "I must have learned, sooner or later, that-that the Countess of Charle. mount was in the rooms. I prefer hearing it from you. Has she been here long?" "About half an hour,'I think." "Is -is Lord Charlemount here, too P?  "Not yet. But he is coming." , Ah!T ;Clifford 'sat for some minutes in silence, with his eyes bent upon the floor. Did he love Regina still?-and how should he meet her?- lad, above all, how much did HelJn Erlinford know of the story, and of the cowardly man- ner in which he had behaved? He sighed; and then, hearing her speak his name in a low voice, looked up. "Lady Charlemount is coming this way," she said.. "Would you like to take me to mamma?" "'Yes. Thank you a thousand times, Miss Erlinford! I cannot meet her before all these people." They crossed the room, and took up their station by Mrs. Erlinford, who was rejoiced to welcome Clifford, but who hoped (inwardly) that he would not stay near Helen long, since the widowed earl was passing through the rooms, and making himself very agreeable to the fairer portion of his mother's guests. In this hope she was doomed to be disappointed. Clifford lingered, and talked to Helen in a low voice, while they both looked through the open door, at a tall and stately figure, sur- rounded, in the next apartment, by a little knot of courtiers. "I find her altered," he said to Helen. "May I talk to you about her?" "Most certainly." "I have not mentioned her name for all these years. I hardly know why I speak it to you now. But you are so kind that you will forgive it. We are old friends, you know." "Yes. How has she changed?" "nShe looks colder-prouder. Why is she in black?" "I do not know." "She always wore it, rememoer-but with crimson. Now no color relieves it. I wonder if she has lost a friend?" "Of course!" cried Helen, suddenly. "How stupid of me not to remember it!" "Saladin, I suppose?" "How unkind of you, Mr. Clifford! Saladin :q   is dead, poor fellow He died in Rome and they say she was quite hearthroken about him. She has lost all her pets, indeed, but one-the little white dog." A "And so she wears mourning?" "I did not say that." "She is quite capable of it, I assure you." "You should not say those unkind things. Regina---" Clifford started violently. "What is the matter?" "Nothing. I have not heard that'name for so long, that is all!"Le said, rather incoherent- ly. "I beg your pardon, Miss Erlinford. What were you about to say?" "She has lost, besides these pets, a very dear friend." "Who was it?" "Her name 'was Ruth." "Ruth dead! When did she die?" "Two years ago, I believe. It was while they were on the Continent." "Poor little Ruth!" "Did vois now her, Mr. Clifford?' "A little." "And was Lady Charlemount really so very fond of her?" "She really was." "The story of their friendship always seem- ed to me so touching a thing, that I hardly know whether to believe it or not. Do you see that diamond star upon her breast?" "Distinctly." "It is wreathed with crape. Ruth wore it once, and she wears it now, for her sake, al- ways.", t "Who told you?" "Charlemount." ? "Ah! he is ai great friend of yours?" "He is like a brother to me, and has always been." "You meet her, then?" "Often." "Do you visit her?" "Sometimes." "Charlemount House is thrown open, I sup- pose, to all who choose to enter its doors?" "On the contrary, the society there is very select." He laughed bitterly. He was thinking of the time when Regina had talked about their marriage, and pointed out the impossibility of their residing in London. Apparently her opinions were changed. "Why do you laugh?" asked Helen. "I was only wondering at-or, perhaps. should rather say, admiring-English society. I see -that Regina is following us again- Do you think she knows I am here?" "For shame, sir I When you were announced she was in the long Saloon. She has no more idea of your presence than-tian-" "Than you had, Miss Erlinford." "I knew perfectly well that you were com- i.  The countess tld, me.' She always tells    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6470-00000065"/> me if any one is to be here that I would like to meet, and I said I should certainly come ifi you did. There is no great mystery about it, you see. I only wished to shake hands with my old acquaintance, the artist, who painted John Humphreys' so well for me." As she said the words, laughing, the little boudoir and that pleasant spring morning, so long ago, rose up vividly before him. He clenched his teeth and breathed hard as he watched the graceful woman coming toward them-the woman who had first said she loved him upon that very day. ' Is it a happy marriage?" he asked, in a low voice. "'Very--at least people say so. Oharle- mount himself is devoted to her and their little child." "His she any children?" ' One-Stuart Erlinford. Is it not a pretty name? He is four years old-the dearest little fellow, you ever saw, and not a bit spoiled. Much as they love him, they do not indulge him too greatly. I think Charlenount would, only Regina is very firm with them both. She told him, one day, that she had two children to manage instead of one. Stuart was crying, you see, to go into the park, and poor George nearly cried with him, when he was sent away in disgrace, with his nurse. You will see a portrait of the little Lord Erlinford in the ex- hibition. He is said to be very like the Erlin- fords; but, I confess, I see more of the mother in his face."  CHAPTER XIl I have grown wise! the disciplines and trials Through which I passed with bitter'groans and tears, Were but the shadows on God's golden dials, Pointing me onward to serener years! Beneath my feet the "Enchanted Ground " is lying, Where my soul slumbered on its onward way;  And far above such idle grief and sighing, I watch the dawning of a brighter day!-M. B. Clifford did not answer. It had been a bit. ter tale, that of her marriage; but he felt an- other and a keener pang at the thought of this little child. It was a tie between Regina and her husband, stronger than had ever existed between Regina and himself; and while he had pictured her mourning secretly over his deser- tion, even with that coronet upon her brow, she had been holding this infant to her heart, and tracing, possibly, the father's look within the ,'little face. Never had she seemed so utterly lost to him-never so much Charlemount's as now! She came on, stopping now and then to speak to an acquaintance, till she reached the place where Helen Erlinford sat. Without noticing the tall gentlemap inthe background, who made way for her, she sat down upon the little sofa, and gave Helen's hand a playful squeeze. Truant I have been looking for you ever since I came. Where did you vanish after we entered the rooms?" It was not I tat  nished," said Hel.   "Before I had an opportunity to speak to you, you were seized upon by one of your numerous adorers!"  "My dear, don't talk scandal His Excel. lency Baron Brenowitz took me into the next saloon, in order to talk to me about butter- flies. He is butterfly-mad, you know-and the only way I could escape from him, at last, was by promising to hunt the poor creatures with a net in the rose-garden at Erlinford, for him. I need not tell you that they will escape me very easily. I don't mind runuing up and down the walks with a net, if it will please the poor old man-it will be fine fun for Stuart, too I But fancy me impaling one of those bright spirits on a pin! Upon my word, Helen, naturalists seem to have no bowels of compas- sion! They only look upon the happy crea. tures God has made with scientific eyes, and have no more scruple about putting them to the torture thln you would in brushing aa ly from the bit f sugar destined for vour coffec. cup.".  "I knowhat you would do 'ithl the fly," said Helen, laughing. "What?" , You would let him stay: you would go without the sugar-drink your coffee unsweet- ened-rather than disturb him at his meal." "I don't doubt it in the least. And, do you know, this boy takes after his manner in that respect. His nurse could not get him to bed till past ten o'clock last evening, because Prince Charhe had seen fit to go to sleep upon the pillow, and Stuart would not have him dis- turbed. I gave him a little gold chain on which he' has long fixed the eye of desire, when I heard of it this morning.' Without turning her head, Helen could see how intently the eyes of the gentleman behind them were fixed upon her companion-how eagerly he listened to every word she uttered. She stole a look up into his grave face. "Shall I speak?" it seemed to say; and reading it alight, he bent his head almost imperceptibly. With a nervous tremor agitating her, and a deep flush burning on her cheek, she brqached the difficult subject. "Regida, I wish to speak to you about some- thing." "Very well--,I see nothing that prevents you."  "Are you in a good humor this evening?" A most seraphic one!" "At peace with all the world.?" "Entirely-!" And therefore ready to meet and welcome even those who have offended you?" "No one has offended me," said Regina, looking at her quietly. -'Not at present, perhaps; but in other daysl" A slight shadow darkened the proud, tran- quil face.  "'Ah! - other days  That is a different   affair. I have forgotten all about other days, and would rather not talk about them, if you. please?"  "Don't be unforgiving, Regina." "I am sot!" "At this moment some one who is very sorry for having pained and wounded you, is waiting to tell you so!" "If any one has pained and wounded me, I wish them to tell me-nothing "s said Regina, looking very much disturbed. "How hard, how unjust you are!" "I must go back to Baron Brenowltz and the butterflies!" She rose, in spite of the detaining hand Ilelen laid upon her arm. But before she could move away, Clifford came swiftly from his concealment, and stood before her. Many carious eyes were upon them at that moment; itut there was nothing in Regina'i look or man- ner with which the most rigorous could find fault. No blush rose to her pale, clear cheek. She did not start-she did not turn away. There was a moment's silence; then she&amp; held outl her hand, and said coldly, but courteously: "Mr. Clifford. allow me to congratulate you upon your safe return to England!" He took the gloved hand, bent confusedly over it, aud murmured something inaudible about the pleasure he felt in meeting her again. Helen stole quietly away after Mrs. Erlinford, who. was hurrying off with the news of the rec- onciliation; the good people ' every side, after a momentary stare, pursued their own devices; and Regina sank gracefully and lan- guidly back into the seat from which she had just risen, and made room, for Clifford by her side. They were together once more. Did she remember their wretched parting as well as he? He could not tell. He looked at her. The proud, dark eyes met his own calmly-the sweet voice did not falter-the hand which held her bouquet and fan was firm and steady. The passion and the pain were then over for Regina as for him; and the two had once vowed to live and die for each other, mi. ht meet as strangers now, without feeling one throb of pain at the thought of all they had enjoyed-and lost for ever! Was it so? When did you arrive?" she asked. "By the last steamer. This is the first house I have entered (with the exception of my hotel since my return. I little expected to meet you here 1" "It was a very unexpected pleasure, I con- fess, to me," she said, so gravely, that he could not tell if she was speaking sarcastically or not.  "I have just heard you speak of the past in a way that would seem to forbid any allusion to it," he began. "Yet, if I might be per- mitted to Pay one thing?" * Allusions to the past are always useless  In this case they' mav he worse than useless!" ,        9   What did she mean? Did she love him still? He colored with pleasure at the thought. She watched him, and a quiet smile of scorn played around her lips. '"I see what a blunder you are making, Mr. Clifford. I. retract what I said. You may allude to the past as much as you like '1"' Stung and mortified as he was by her man- ner, he had to speak. "I wished to ask you to forgive my-my in- justice and; cruelty!" "It was forgiven long ago!" "And forgotten?" "I advise you not to ask too many ques- tions! In general, people forgive very much sooner than they forget i" "I have suffered in consequence of that cruelty far more than you!" "You think so?"Her eyes rested upon him for one moment with a powerful glance. "I am sure of it! For in addition to all the. pain and agony, I carried remorse for ever with me.", "You need carry it no longer. Let us talk of other things. Tell me of your travels?" "1 cannot 1" * You enjoyed them, I trust?" "C h,:wonndetully!" "You are vexed, because I will not go on speaking of what between us ought not to be m  ioned at all. What possible good can there be in raking over the ashes of a fire that went out long ago?" "Entirely?" "Entirely!" I thought as much!" he sai , bitterly. "And pray what else did you expect?" you asked, with flashing eyes. "Did you imagine I was going to sit here beside you; and sigh sentimentally over days which-which I wish 1 had never seen! I am a wife and a mother, Mr. Clifford -a happy wife and a haplpy mother. I greeted you, to-night, as I mightt greet any old acquaintance-more kindly, per- haps, because I knew it would be Charlemount's wish that I should repair, by that kindness, the breach that once existed between you two If you still persist in misunderstanding me, I will go away, and send him to make his peace, in person." "You are angry with me,". he said, in a very low tone. "Not with you-with that detestable vanity which characterizes your sex, and which will not allow you to rest contented with the friend- ly welcome I give you; which makes you turi and twist every word I utter into a hidden ac- knowledgment of suffering and regret which . do not feel-which I have not felt for four long years."  "' Good Heavens! how bitter you are!" "Because I am even more disappointed ini you. now. than I was once before!"  "No doubt, " she' answered, sadly. "* I .e-r to have the gift of dissppoiating every one whb     <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6470-00000066"/> knows me. I believe there is nothing good, or noble, or tiue left in me!" "Whose fault ie that?" '"My . wn, you will say?" I am sure it can be no other person's. There was a time, Mr. Clifford, when you had very much that was good about you 1" * The time has gone by.' "It call come back again!" "Hw?" "' You have only to wish, and to will!" "Ah, that is all yo i know about it I It is too late for me to mend. Mine is a wrecked uod broken life,. I amn by no means what I was. I hope for nothing-care for nothing-love nothing-and believe in nothing!" "A happy state of mind!" "Very!" '* fake my advice, and get out of it as soon as pos8ib'e." "i Too late! too late!" he repeated, shaking his head. "* One of these days you will sing a more cheerful song. Ah!" * \What is it?" She was looking toward the door, and a kind smile came into her eyes. '* Charlemount is coming, Mr. Clifford I Y7ou must stay and shake hands with h nc 1' "I do not see him!" "Miss Erlinford is on his arm. Now can you see them?" *' Yes." B'ut Clifford, after one hasty glanee at thb advancing pair, turned again to her. It, was not the old, glad, gay light that he remember- ed, which shone upon her face, but an expres- sion infinitely kind and genial, such as had not ,e'imed out once during their tte t-tete. It made him jealous, even though the old love had died away. "Do you care for him?" he asked. The bright, dark eyes met his own, with a look of surprise. "Of course. Why do you ask?" "What a convenient thing a woman's heart must be! It can be off with the old love and on with the new, at a moment's notice, and without the slightest pain!" "It appears to me that you -are talking in your sleep!" she said, haughtily. ., I beg you will keep such opinions to yourself--they have no peculiar interest for me: and I wish you and Cha:lemount to he friends, if possible ;'but I tell you, fairly, your chince is but a poor one, if you persist in those ill-timed speeches ant allusions. My dear Helen, I think you are a ppacemaker in general, this evening!" "Clharlemonht was not half so naughty as you, Regina!" said Miss Erlinford, as she hronuht up hbr charge before the pair. 1"He never is." A look of nineasinees, which Clifford had been' pleased t, ace upo, thl efPrl'R face, vanished at this speech, and he gave his wife a ftoni, trust-   ing look, as he came nearer and held out his hanil to his former rival. ," Mr. Clifford, I can say, with all my heart, that I am sorry for the past. It was so long ago, that I think we, can both afford to be geu- erous, and shake hands as if that stupid quar. rel had never. been!" "The apology should come from me, my lordI Her ladyship has already been kind enough to pardon me! I ask your forgiveness now!" "Psha! my dear fellow, we were' a couple of fools together, that is all; and now we are friends!' said the warm-hearted, nobleman, giv. ing his hand a powerful grasp. "You must come and see us, Clifford." "I shall be very happy, I am sure!" "I have a thousand things to talk to you about-- parliamentary business! Did you know I am now a regular attendant in the House of Lords?" "No, my lord." "All her doing!" saidl Charlemount, nodding gayly over his shoulder. "' I had no peace till I took my seat; and one of these days she ex- pects to see the Thames in a state- of combus- tion, illumination, and what not, after my maiden speech 1" Clifford sighed as he listened to him. Fame, rauk, fortune, and love, all followed this man and ministered to him. Aad he -what was he? An obscure author-a lonely.' and sad, and disappointed manI Helen Erlinford's sweet blue eyes lookeo pityingly a, him. Was it yet too late? "My dear Charlemount, you must finish your conversation with Mr. Clifford at some other time," said Regina, taking his arm. "' We ought to have been at S--- House half an hour ago." "Very well, I am at your orders. When will you come and dine with us, Clifford? To- morrow?"          ,  "To-morrow we are. engaged!" interposed Regina. "The day after, then. I know that is an at- home day. Come early, Clifford, and I will show you my boy. He is the finest fellow in England!" "Like all only sons!" shid Regina; laugh- ing. "Good-night, Helen - good-night, Mr. Clifford." He bowed over the hand she held out, and watched them as they passed out of the room. How stat ly she was-how fond and attentive he seemed I Five years of constant intercourse had only made her dearer to that happy hue band. And the boy-their child-he was sooa to see it; to trace in its youDg face the blended features and expressions of both I It was a pleasant thought While he stood, battling with the jealousy and anger that consumed him, a little sigh fell upon his ear, and he looked down upon Helen Eriinford watching him with her kind eyes.   "I am sorry if I have pained you by bring- ing you thgether!" ' she said, gently. "I thought it would be better-" * It is better, and I am very glad it is over' " he auewered. "But you see, Miss Erlinford, one has to get used to seeing the woman one has loved-in such very different circumstances. I do not care for her now, yet I confess to a little jealousy I" Mrs. Erlinford approached them, leaning on her husband's arm. "Well, Helen, you have managed the matter beautifully. Every one is talking about it I I amn vpry glad, Mr. Clifford, that you are all friends again!" "And so am I, madam. Are you going so 800s?" "Yea," said the "M. P.," shaking hands with him. "We are due it another party. Come, Helen,"  "Will Miss Erlinford allow me?" Helen accepted the proffered arm.  He wrapped her little cloak .carefully around her, and led her down the stairs, but did not speak till she was about to enter th carriage. Then he pressed her hand, and said, in a low tone: T Thank you-God bless you!"    The words gave her bright' and pleaant dreams that night. , Clifford, walking next morning idly in Hyde Park, long before fashionable hours, was some- what amused and interested by the sight of a little child riding up and down the deserted Roftten Row, mounted on a snow-white pony, with hoofs like jet and eyes of fire, and a flow- ing tail that almost swept the ground. A mounted groom followed him as he careered to and fro. The dress of the boy was of the richest material and most dainty fashion, and his golden hair fell in heavy curle upon the, collar of his velvet riding-coat. Clifford sat down beneath a tree, and began to sketch him on a leaf of his note-book, almost involuntarily. The child looked now and then toward him somewhat curiously, as he passed. A- knot of beggar-boys left their play beside the Ser. pentine, and watched the beautiful pony with envious" eyes. One of them was not only poor and ragged, but deformed and lame; aidd as he stood there leaning on his crutch-his hol- low cheeks flushed with excitement, and his worn, little frame trembling with admiration- the beautiful pony stopped suddenly before the feine, and its young rider bent from the saddle and looked pityingly down at him. "Little boy, how ill you look!" he cried. "Are you lame? Cannot you walk without those things P?" "No, my lord," cried out a bold urchin be- side him. "Jim fell down stairs, he did, and put his back out when he was a little shaver!" "And who are you?"  "I'm Tom-I'm his brother, my lord," said   the boy, pulling his forelock respectfully, and drawing nearer to'the cripple. "Do you know me?" "Been you in the park lots of times, my lord." The little fellow scrambled out of the sad- dle, and held 'out his hand to the deformed boy.  "Should you like a ride?" he said, kindly. "Oh, my lAr   ' 1", The poor child's eyer filled with tears at the idea of such a wonderfurl pleasure. "He would-wouldn't he, Tom!" "Must be a fool if h* didn't, my lord!" was Master Tom's sententious reply. "Then help me put him in the saddle, and, he shall have one. Come, my poor boy, There, give me your hand. Tom must help you up, for he is bigger than I am. There you are!" With much exertion and tugging on the part of three or four of the boys-none of whom were much more than ten years old-the feat was accomplished ; and the cripple, seated on the back of his fairy s'eed, looked down witil wondering eyes at his companions. The groom sat like a statue on his own horse, at a little distance. He had his orders, and if his young master had seen fit to amuse himself by sweep ing the crossings, would hardly have interfered. But there was a suspicious moisture about his eyes as he watcied the extraordinary scene. "' Lord- love him 1" he muttered; ,' he's got a heart as tender as a little baby's If all lordsrwere like him! i" James nodded his head sagely, and moved pace or two'nearer.  Clifford rose and leaned upon the fence. Seeing. for the first time, a lady dressed in black, who was reading upon one of the seats, but who' had laid down her book to watch the  children, the truth flashed across his mind.  The fair-haired, slender child was hers I  He was the young Lord Erlinfor&amp;d "Take the bridle, James," his clear, sweet voice was saying. "* I will lead the pony, and Tom shall walk on the other side; so you can- not fall off. Now, are you ready?" In this order, the strange procession started off.  The boys ran along the walk, cheering  enthusiastically. The little lord trotted man- fully over the soft ground,;his golden hair just reaching the pony'S breast; and Tom looked at his siek brother with-iproud, delighted eyes. The lady rose, and, comine up to the fence, gazed long and earnestly after them. There were tears on her cheek. As she wiped them away, and turned back to her seat, her eyes, fell upon Clifford, who took off his hat, and bowed profoundly. "You here l" she said, with a little start. "I might well echo the question,"-he an. swered, with a smile. ,4 Oh! Hdo not pretend to be fashionable. I  do a number of things that no one else thinks of doing; and this is one. I  bring'my maid' with me every morning, and read. whiileStuaiit    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6470-00000067"/> takes his ride. I never ride with him myself. I have lost Saladin. and I will mount no other horse." "Faithful to everything but me," thought Clifford, bitterly, but he said nothing. * You saw my boy?"   ' "I did. Allow me to congratulate you on having such a child!" replied Clifford, as they seated themselves to wait his return. "I am the happiest woman in England," she cried out, while her eyes filled again. "I am prouder of him this morning than I can say." "You have reason to be." "It is a loving heajt, and I have always taught him to reverence the poor; but I con- fess I never knew the lesson had taken so deepf a root. Look Hthere he is again!" The cheers of the boys were faintly heard in tIe distance, as the little fellow came galloping down the ride, his face flushed with generous excitement, and his golden, hair dying in the wind. "Mother," he cried, checking his pony un- der the tree, "this makes the fifth time I have been up and down the Row. Am I to go home now?" * Yes, my dear 1" was Regina's reply. "I shall follow you directly." He kissed his little hand to her, and rode away with James. Neither mother nor son made any allusion to .the incident which had just taken place. The child's pitying heart saw nothing meritorious in the act-the mother would not destroy its beauty by a single word of injudicious praise. *"You are training him up well," said Clif- ford, as they went down the walk,'followed by the countess's maid. " "Do you think so? I am trying to do my duty by him, and I ask God to show me how," she answered, very humbly. "He is very young; but I think, without any motherly vanity, I may say that his heart is far beyond his years. He is no prodigy of learning, I confess. He bungles over his alphabet, and- has a wholesome horror of printed books. But he is generous and brave, and full of feel- ing. That is quite enough to work upon." 4* Yes." Clifford sighed as he said it. This was the woman he had thought unfit for the duties of wifehood and maternity-this was the heartless coquette who had bartered his love for a coro- net. But for his folly, she might have been his own, and a child as fair and good as Stuart might have gladdened both their hearts. ' We will leave my boy for the present," she said, stealing a look at his gloomy face. "And since we have agreed to forget 11 that is pain- ful in the past, and to talk simply and confi- dentially, as two old friends might talk, I. sup- pose I may say that I am very glad indeed to see you back in England. Have you come to stay in your own land?" "That I do not know."   "You have been roaming for so many years, that you may well settle quietly down at last." "To do that, one needs home; and-and -some onedin that home." "Both lie within your grasp "I do not understand you. ' "In the old days, Mr. Clifford-the days when I first knew you, and when we were so happy together-I used to talk to you as if roc had seen my brother. Have I that privilige yet?" "O Regina, if you would only use it!" he murmured. "Very well, Clifford!" She held out her hand; he clasped it firmly for a moment. It was the pledge of a new re- latiunship, to be more enduring than the old one-a quiet and steady friendship, calmer than the lost love, nud yet-alas! that we should say it i-far pleasanter and more satis. fying to both. "Now for my lecture!" she said, playfully. "I think you are throwing life away at pres- ent. Clifford."' "Ah I I do not need you to tell me that!" You might be very happy if you would." Show me how?" "I have only to name a name." "Let me hear it?" "If I do, I shall betray one of my own sex; that I will not be guilty of, unless you promise to act upon the information I give you." "If practicable, I will," said Clifford, whose cheek began to deepen in .color. *"Helen Erlinford." He drew a long breath. "Are you sure, Regina?" 'Quite." "Has she, ever spoken of me to you?" "Of course not. But you who profess to know women so thoroughly--' "I profess it no longer I' he said, hurriedly. "I went astray once-since then I have never dared to judge them!" "Well, at least I need not tell you that her silence is a sign in your favor." 4 How long have you thought she - she cared for me?" ' For six years," was the quiet reply. He started. "Six years? Why, it is only six years ago that you and Hthat-" "That you and I were engaged," she said, looking at him calmly. "I know it." "How could you think it, then?" "I thought it from the moment when I first saw you together." was the frank reply. "W Wo men read each other very quickly; and I con- fess that I was jealous of her all the while, though I never confessed it to myself till after we parted." '"Strange!" said Clifford, musingly. She stole a glance at him. A peculiar expression   lingered on his face; Pleased to the very heart et the news, he was yet a little annoyed that she could tell itvto him so calmly. His vanity craved the double dose of her agitation and Hlelen's acknowledged love. She burst out laughing, and he turned to her with a blush. ** What have I done now, Regina?" A'Nothing. I was only, amused at your looks. But now that I have enlightenel you on this point, what are you going to do?" "What am I to do?"   *  "'Marry her, of course!" ,-Yes," said Clifford, bitterly; "it would he very wise to ask her to share my lodgings iti the Strand, or my rooms at a hotel, would it not?" "Take a house, then," was the quiet reply. "And with what, pray?" "You have a good income, I believe. Your books sell well -and Mr. Erlinford will, of course, give his daughter a dowry." It'was Clifford's turn to laugh. * I hope you will not be offended, Regina, if I say that your boy has almost as much knowl- edge of -this heartless, fashionable world as you." "Thank you." "Do you for one moment suppose that- even if Miss Erlinford were quite willing to share my garret and my crust-her parents would allow her to do so?  No, my dear friend. If that is the partner you propose, I must go on through life as solitary as now." "Very well," she answered, shrugging her shoulders. "A willful man must have his way. But don't grumble at me hereafter, if you miss this happiness. Some one else will come, and Pak for her. Do you suppose she will wait for you forever?' '; On the contrary, I shall one day see Helen Erlinford happy with another, as I now see you. No, Regina, if I have bad such a wild dream-and it may be, that it came to me not many hours ago, even-I am wide awake now, and I know it cannot be, If I was rich-" "'If! If! Well, what of 'if?'" "I would go at once and say, ' Helen, love me!' 1 am poor, so I stay here with you, and only ask for your friendship!" they were silent for some time. At last, Re- gina said: "You went to Tasmania?"  , "Yees."-. "And then?" "4 Ah and then where did I not go, Regi- na? I sought rest everywhere, and I found it not." "You never looked in the right place." "You found it!" "Yes. Though, perhaps, I deserved it no more than you!" "Are you quite happy?"  "Quite. I love my husband very dearly; though I owf I did not when I married him. And my'child, of course, is dear. But that is   not all, Clifford-that is not all that makes me so content." What remains?" "What, indeed?" she said, sadly: "I should have asked that question once. I know. How strange it is, Cliford, that while we yearn ,and struggle eo after poor, frail human love, we never give one thought or wish to the Divine." "You have found that as well." "I trust so." They were at the door of Charlemount House. as she spoke. "Will you come in?" "May I?" he askedpwith a peculiar look. And she smiled and preceded him up the steps. Two or three obsequious servants came for. ward to show Clifford to the drawing-room, while the Countess herself went in search of Charlemount: She found him in the library, looking over the morning paper, while the little Lord Er- linford played quietly'in one corner of the' the room. "Well, my love!" he said, looking up at her with a smile. "I have brought some one home with me, George "I "Who-who is it?" "Clifford."  How lazily she spoke that word now. He smiled, remembering the time when he had not dared to breathe it before her. "And so Clifford is beneath this roof once more?  He comes with more pacific inten- tions, r trust, than he did the last time, Re- gina."   .  A momentary shudder flitted over her face: "Where is he?" "In the morning-room, George." "I detest that morning-room; it is always so full of glaring light. Why should not Clifford come here, Regina?" "I know no reason."  The earl ring the bell, and gave an order to Howe, who answered it. A peculiar smile hov- ered around the man's thin lips dis he ushered Clifford into the room. The author noticed it He remembered the ervant's fact-he hid been present at that foolish duel, Doubtless, he re- membered it, and was smiling at the .strange turn affairs had taken. It seemed a thoqsaud years ago, as he came up to Oharlemount and took his hand once more. Here is a new candidate for your friend- ship," said the earl, drawing the. little boy for- ward. "Stuart, shake hands witih this gentle- man, and remember through life that' he was to the like a brother." The child obeyed,looking ap with his mo- ther's smiile into the author's face. i' If my father and mother' love yoT, I sh  love you, too," he announced, gravely. ' Anrd Aunt Helen-4oes Aunt ielen love you P"  He means 'Miss Erlinford," saidi RIgina roguishly.      '          't    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6470-00000068"/> And Clifford's face turned crimson as the boy repeated his question. "I am sure I cannot tell," he stammered at last. "I will ask her the very next time I see her." "You will do nothing of the kind, Stuart!" said Regina. coming to the rescue. "Where is that wonderful tower you were building? Bring the bricks, and I will help you. Your father and Mr. Clifford wish to talk about poli- tics, and we are very much in their way." The earl's eyes followed his wife and child, as they knelt in the distant corner over their playful task. Clifford also turned that way. They both smiled. "Regina is only a year or two older than the boy, I think," said Charlemount. "I have no doubt she thoroughly enjoys the sport; and if I were to go and topple the tower over, she would be far angrier than  Stuart. But we will leave them to themselves. Tell me what you have been doing through all these years." "They are a blank, my lord," said Clifford, with a melancholy smile. *' And who has made them so?" "Heaven knows-I don't!" "You are sadder than you used to be!" "I am older." "Why, so am I, for the matter of that; and yet each year seems to find and leave me more contented than the last!" "You and I are somewhat differently situ- ted, my lord," esaid Clifthrd, bitterly. You nave rank and wealth, and a happy home. He paused, and looked toward Regina and the child, with a glance so full of melancholy that the other could scarcely feel a pang of jealousy. Charlemount gazed at him in sil- ence. This was his work. How was he to re- pair it?" - ' You have far more talent than I," he said at last. "Yes ; and a fine chance of displaying it!"' "Of courfe!" "I may write novels which will sell at a guinea per volume-poems which would bring me three guineas a page-newspaper ' leaders'  --possibly a speech or two for some ambitious member of Parliament; and when the wear and tear of brain is over, and the guineas spent, what then-what then, my lord?" "I do not understand you." "What will it all amount to in the end? The little paltry fame I may acquire will make me lie no easier in my grave, when I am once lucky enough to get into it; the guineas will not last forever'; and there is not one soul on earth to care for the life I live here, or the name I Jeave behind  me. I have had serious thoughts, lately, of throwing down the pen forever, and taking up the mattock and the spade in its stead. By industry and persever- nee, I should earn enough to support life.   Or I might be a bricklayer-anything-any. thing--anything but what I am," he added, wildly--" the loneliest and most miserable man upon God's earth!" Charlemount had been lietening silently. Now, however, his. brow grew dark, and, tak. ing Clifford's hand in both his, he whispered, as he looked at the playmates in the corner: "Answer me, as one honest man would an- swer another-is it because you have lost her that you are' so wretched?" "No," said Clifford,. ia a low tone, looking steadily into his anxious eyes. "I was miser- able enough at first; but that was long ago. That pain is all over, and with this she has no. thing to do!" "Upon your-honor?" "Upon my honor!" Oharlemount dropped his hand, murmur. ing: "Thank God for that!" "You will understand," said Clifford, in the same low tone, " that I could not meet her again without emotion. She felt' none; she had forgotten everything. I still remembered some things, and my hand trembled when hers was calm and steady. But 1 have put down that last lingering weakness now. The Regina I loved died long ago..  The Countess of Charlemount is as a dear sister to me-no more!" "No more!" repeated the earl, with a sigh. "That is well! To lose her must be pain enough for any man to bearl To love her still, having lost her-good Heaven I it would drive me mad!" His strange manner startled Clifford inex- expreseibly; and a suspicion, so dim and faint as hardly to- deserve the name, crossed his mind for the first time. It faded away again, as Regina,. looking up when the earl raised his voice, came toward thm e There could have been no treachery-he was mad to think it. . She had chosen him freely, and how she loved him now tI She leaned on his arm, and lookedl up at him with the old, playful smile, which Clifford remembered so well. "What are you two quarreling about now? The Prime Minister, or the Corn Laws?" "It was about the prime minis-tress, my love ' said the earl, playfu'ly. i"We were talkiag of you! ' "You might have had another subject. Mr. Clifford looks sad and pale. I am quite certain you have bored him terribly, while I have been , building my tower."  "Mr. Clifford is weary, but not of me or of you, Regina, I trust!" "Of what, then?" "Of the world f' "That is Dart of his profession," she answer- ed, without'looking up.

"He is low-spirited and lonely, and -and-" "And-and. You are a goose, George 1" she said, laughing. "I have no doubt you have her complaining of your own evil fortune, if the truth was told! You two have been sigh- ing in sympathy ever since Stuart and I turn- ed our innocent backs upon you!" "There is no evil in my lot now!" said Charlemount, looking at her fondly. ," I have nothing but blessings - little as I deserve them!" "Mr. Cljfford might have the same if he chose; -though, I dare say,Ihe is quite as un- deserving as you, in your mock humility, pre. tend to be. I am quite out of patience with him because he will not take the ' good the gods provide' him, and set about being happy as fast as possible." "I have already given you reasons," cried Clifford, impatiently, " which ought to be suf- ficient and satisfactory, if you had the least-' He checked himself, but she added, with a orovoking little courtesy: *' Bit of coqmmon sense, you were going to say. Thank you! I have none of that desir- able article, but George has; and you may ask him'if everything you said was not sheer non- sense." "What has he said, Regina?" "Why, that hee-ook at that child's eyes  they are as large as saucers I Go to your cas- tle, Stuart, dear, and I will eome in a few mo- ments."

The earl smiled, and stroked his beard, well knowing how much Regina secretly admiired that patriarchal ornament. Clifford mused, aa he walked up and down the room with his hands behind him. At last he stopped before the two. "You really advise me to speak, Charle- mount?" "Indeed I do, Clifford "' "And you, Regina?" "You know very well what I think. I sup- pose you will wish to employ me as an embas. eador next?" "Not I!" said Clifford, so hastily that she burst out laughing. "1 would plead in your favor. 'But will you. really go?" "Iwill!" Regina cHapped her hands, and executed a little playful dance around the two gentlemen. It put Clifford in mind of her return to him from Italy, and he could not help sighing. "Dar Helen! she will be happy at last!" she ,cried. "And I shall call her umy sister!" Her face grew sad suddeuly, and she leaned her head upon .her husband's shoulder, and thought of her dead friend.  Charlemount also bad grown used to a name, and he heard it now without any outward sign; of emotion. "My love," he whispered, 6"there is the pocket-borough of Erliuford. You shall give it to Clifford I! Once in Parliament, and our cousin Hugh will scarcely have the heart to object to him l" Regina looked up with a bright smile, and repeated the earl's offer aloud. "Will you accept it?" she asked, and held out her hand. Much moved, Clifford took it and Oharle- moulit's in his own. "My dear friends--" "Yes or no, Clifford P" "Yes, Regina!" "That's a good boy " she cried, appro, ingly. Then turning to the table,- she gathered up his hat, gloves, and cane and, putting them into his hand, pointed to the door. "Go!" "Go?" Clifford looked utterly bewildered,- so did the earl; and the latter ventured to remon- strate. "  "My dear, what can you mean?" She stamped her foot impatiently.

"Well, there-don't lose another minate, and good luck to you  We dine at seven-don't forget it 1" She led him to the door, and gave him a parting smile.

As Clifford left the library, Howe advanced through the hall, and accosted him respect- fully. "I beg your pardon, sir, but I have some- thing very particular to communicate to you." * Indeed!" said Clifford, abstractedly. "What may it be?" "I cannot very well tell you here, sir," re- plied Howe, glancing toward the tall servant ou duty. ' May I take the liberty of asking if you return here to-day?" ,* To dinner, Howe." The matl stepped back with a gratified smile. "** O, sir. that is the very thing I could have wished  After dinner, then, perhaps you will allow me to. say a few words-they concern yourself. Mr. Clifford, or I would not take the liberty of asking the favor." "You shall say what you like, and when you like," was the good-humored reply, as Clifford passed down the steps, and hailing a disen- gaged cab at the corner of the street, dashed ,ff to try his fortune, i" like a prince in a fairy- tale." It was still -unfashionably early when he reached Mr. Erlinford's door; but the lady of the mansion, having shut herself up in her own dressing-room in a fit of "the megrims," was unable to forbid his admittance, and a com- placently-civil servant ushered him up-stairs into a pretty little boudoir, tenanted only by I elen and her old governess, half-asleep, as usual, ove r her work, in the sunniest corner of the room. The old lady gave an approving glance at the fair-hatred stately stranger. Helen gave him her hand, with a blush like that of the roses over which he found. her bending "You must forgive this intrusion!" he said, with a smile. "Me Clifford knows he is always welcome; his visits cen never be classed under that head," was the reply. "Mr. Clifford has an excuse for this one, owever."   "And what may that be? Not that it is needed. But as a mere matter of curiosity, I should like to know the 'open sesame' you are going to pronounce." "It is a very si ple one.'  "So much the better." "Only one word!" "Be kind enough to speak it." "Regina k" She flushed up a little, and looked at him from under her long- eyelashes. How quietly he spoke the name I But had its charm so en. tirely vanished? "Regina!" she repeated. "What has she to do with your coming?" "She sent me." "With a message." "Yes." "To me-or to mamma?" "To you." "What was it?" "I will tell you presently. What beautiful roses those are, Miss Erlinford." "Do you think so? They are from the Hall. They used to grow under my window there." "And when you took the flight, did roses spread their crimson wings. and follow you "' "Not exactly of their own accord, Mr. Clif- ford. The gardener sent them, and I have tended them most carefully here. They do not droop at all yet." "Iam sure they ought not!" he said, with an admiring glance at the little white hand that hovered about the flowers. "Would it be high treason to ask for one of those favored roses, Miss Erlinford?" Her cheek deepened a little in color, as she answered: "No!" "I shall beg one, then." "Do you really wish it?" she asked, with- out looking up.         . . "Can you doubt it?"  "There!" and she chose the fairest blosspm, and held it toward him. He took possession of it and the hand together. "Do not let it die to-day "' she murmured. "Ah Miss Erlinford, it shall he carefully watched; and when, in spite of all my care. it fades, I shall keep the dead leaves, to remind me "  Of what, she was not destined to hear just at that moment; for the governess, too deaf to hear what was going on. inadvertently uttered a lively French exclamation, as a gaudily- tinted paroquet flew from his ring. and upset flaacon by her side. Helen ran. to repair the mishap, and to restore the truant t his perch. Of course, the conversation, so interrnpted, could not be at once resumed, and her first question was: "And where did you see Regina so early, Mr. Clifford?" i "Just fancy for yourself! I have seen her !   as ' Mary Stuart' and ' Zenpbia'-et cetera, et cetera- a score of times. To-day, she appeared iu a new character-as ' Cornelia,' with her jewels-or, rather, with her jewel." "Was she in the Park?" "You have guessed it." "You saw Stuart, then?" "I did." '* And did you like him?" "I confess he is a glorious little fellow!' And he related the scene with the cripple. Helen's eyes sparkled with tears before he fiuished. He has the best of hearts, and Regina has watched over him most anxiously. What did she say to him after this?" ' Nothing. She only sent him home as quietly as if he had been amusing himself in an ordinary way. That was the finest part of ill. One word of self-consciousness from the child--one look of undue approval from the mother-.-would have spoiled the act. As it is, if she pursues this course with him, Lord Er- Isnford will be a ' peer of the realm' in very iaIuymore senses than one.'" He sighed as he said it, and trifled with the rose he held. Helen felt that she trod upon dangerous ground, yet something urged her "Are you sorry that you have met them- I mean, CharlemouBt and Regina?" she asked, quietly. "Oh! no. What could make you think so?" "You seem so grave and sad when you talk of her."' "Do I? I am unconscious of anv such feel- ings. I may be grave, for I am getting old, and learning to feel lonely. I' may be sad; but it is not for the reason you imply. Do you believe me? "Yes, I suppose so," was the hesitating an- swer. "Only a little, I think. Is it because I was somewhat agitated when we met the other evening" " She blushed, as his deep-blue eyes were bent upon her searchingly. "Not exactly. But-T should think it would be very difficilt to forget Regina?" "I grant that. Nav, I will say more -it would be very impossible!" A little sigh answeret him. "But there are different ways of remember- ing her, you know. I loved her deeply, I con- ft-es-and she has cost me more hours of pain than I should care to tell you. But pain, thank Heaven, does not last forever-and mine has gone!" 'Entirely?" "You are in an unbelieving mood. Yes- entirely!" ' I did not think so the other evening." It is always hard to meet those whom we have loved so tenderly, as strangers. Always   hard to look, for the first time, at our trea- sure, after it has become ,the treasure of an- other. But the meeting and the look are now in the past, and they can sever come again to either of us. I wish I cdld convince you of this."  Helen's heart gave a quick little bound. 'If he did not care for her, why this anxiety? "I am going to dine with them to-oay," he went on; "and I assure you, I shall eat umv dinner as quietly, with Regina at the head of Charlemount's table, as 1 should do if )our friend yonder occupied her place:" Helen smiled, he looked toward the govern- ess, now slumbering serenely in her easy- chair. "I am glad to hear iti" she said, simply. "But I confess, when I see that happy home, I feel one regret. I mistook Regina lamentably when I fancied she had no domes- tic taste; but in those dissatisfied moments my fancy turned elsewhere for its ideal-and found it ' She was quite silent. "I see my blunder-and it is too late to re- pair it, in one sense df the word. The woman whom lbelieved to be vain, and trifling, and unprincipled, is a devoted wife and a good mother; and I look at her admiringly, and say, 'God bless her!' with all my hearr-without one wish, however, to change the present tor the past, believe me. With me, she would never have been so happy; for I can see, at last, how little we were really suited to each other. From my soul, I am thankful that she, to-day, is Countess of Charlemount, and that I am free!" He dropped his voice as he said the words, and drew nearer the blushing girl, "Shall I tell you what that one regret is, which I feel in Regina's home,?" She bent her head.. "I regret these years that have been so lonely-I regret. the enthusiasm, the warmth, the ardor, that have left me forever. With them, I, too, might have won a woman's heart; they would have given me a home, and after-. ward made it quite as happy as hers." "They will come back to you again!" she said, in a low voice.  He shook his head with a melancholy smile. "Ah I never. It is not alone through her that they have gone. My whole life, as I look back upon it, seems td have been one unceas. ing effort to get rid of whatever might origin- ally have been good and true within me. I have succeeded at last; aid stand before you,. Helen, to-day, a selfish, and worldly, and. most unloveable man 1'" Her eyes told a different tale, as they met his for one moment. "Helen." he said, "I should not have vea- tured to speak like this, but for her." "Regina?"' "Yea,    .     <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6470-00000070"/> "What has she been telling you?" And the fair face was dyed with asudden rush of crimson, that revealed the secret of it- self. "You should rather ask me what I have been telling her." "What?" ' That I love you, Helen!" There was a breathless pause. He took the white hand that trembled go in his own, and went on. "That I love you-if not so-madly as I loved her-at least, far more tenderly and truly. It did not pain her to hear it, Helen. 8t)e sent me her e. to-day, to utter the words again to you, and wished me God-speed on my journey And when I said that I was poor and unknown, and dared not plead my cause, what do you think her husband did?" "I cannot tell." "He placed the pocket-borough of Erlinford at my disposal; and I may gain your father's consent with it-if I can first gain yours--to my happiness!" "Dear George!' resumed Helen. "* He was always like a brother to rae!" "And to me  Thank Heaven that f can say it still! But, Helen, is his kindness to be all in vain? Six years ago, I should have asked the question more confidently; but now I con  fees 1 tremble at the thought of what my doom may be. Can you love a man, Helen, who has no title to offer yo--not even the title he once won by his pen?" * For shame, Clifford!" "Ah. Helen, take pity on me! I cling ts you as my last refuge, and my only hope I It is life as well as love that I ask at your hands! Do not send me from you; but forgive my many faults and follies, and show me how to be better and happier in the future! Will you?" The simple, unstudied words came brokenly from his lips, and the lips themselves tremn bled, and the eyes were dim with tears. Helen -looked at him steadily as she drew her hand from his. Was she about to reject him? No  The harnl stole gently back again given this time. and not taken--and it was his darling wilomr te held In his arms, and whose fair head was vling on his breast! Life has many a happy moment in store for such as e-n appreciate them ; but none happier than this-the huished, ecstatic moment after a love. loni concealed and most hopeless, Las hbn acknowledged and returned!  No kiss thrills like that first one; no embrace seems more complete than that which brings those l],ng--adVened hearts together  at last! at litt I And though the lips may have kissed, and the hearts throbbed before, and for ',thera what matters that? The memory'of a past joy has no power to sadden the present. It is there, living, breathing, and glowing, although its stay is but for a fleeting moment. 'Romeo   and Juliet will, very likely, quarrel and part before a twelvemonth' goes by; or, if they marry, will spend the moon after the " honey. moon" in throwing plates at each other's heads, or making up a ' good ease" for the Divorce Court; yet, according to our poet-laureate- "'Tis better to have loved and lost, Than never to have loved at all." And RomPo and Juliet will prbably be the gainers all their, lives long, for that one britf season of ,liss, too exquisite to be believed in, that followed their betrothal. What if it did not last? Such feelings were not made to last, nor are we strong enough to support them for a length of time. So, if Clifford and Helen live a hum-drum life hereafter (as they very probably will do), it will be no affair of mine. Having shown them to you in this tableau of peace and happiness, I shall not feel called upon to follow them beyond the church-door, or to tell you how many times a day they fell out and " kissed again with tears," during the remainder of their double existence. These wonderful movements to which I have alluded are always interrrupted by some unto- ward event. The door opens suddenly, or the postman knocks, or the kitten puts a velvet paw into the woik-basket, and upsets a dozen things with a terrific crash; or a reflection of papa's bald head appears in the pier-glasa behind Romeo, and scares Juliet out of the little sense she has left. In this particular case, the lovers were startled by a shrill "Oh, dear!" and darting out of Clifford's arms, Helen saw hen poor old governess wide-awake, and standing with uplifted hands and eyebrows, looking at 'the unexpected group.  Helen looked so completely terrified, and madame so horror-struck, that after one or two vain at- tempts to preserve his gravity, Clifford burst out laughing. "Can I believe my eyes?" cried MaJame, in French. "Is it my pupil that I see embracing -positively embracing a gentleman in my presence? What is to become of this nation, whose daughters--' "Pardon!" said Clifford, coming to the res- cue. and addressing the shocked lady in her native tongue. ," Sur ly Madame, w*hose bear tiful eyes have done their work so often, will forgive this indiscretion?" "Tn iscretion!" muttered madare, some- what mollified by the allusion to tie dark orbs, which had indeed done wonderful execution in their time. "He calls it an indiscretion only! "It was nothing more, dear tmaame, 1 as- sune you; and all the blame rests with me. I was so overjoyed at seeing that she reallyv cared for me, that I ventured to--to salu/e her!" And, with all due gravity, he finished the explanation by asking, "Amn I forgiven, madame?'  The governess looked at them keenlv for p I moment, and, shrugging up her shoublders, eat   down again, with a peculiar smile playing around her thin lips. "'I refer you to her, monsieur. You must make your peace with her," she said, waving her hand toward Helen. And taking up her embroidery, she became, to all intents and purposes, as oblivious of them as if there had been. no Mrs. Erlinford, to exact -an account of her -harge,'in the world. "Dear old lady," said Cliffof, apostrophiz- ing her in a low tone. "She is a jolly old soul, Helen!'- "A what?" "I beg your pardon, my dear," he said, laughing. "She is a perfect darling-and so is some one else, not-more than a thousand miles from me at this present moment." "Be quiet, Clifford!" said Helen, retreating from his encircling arm. "We will not have any more indiscretions, if you please. I want to talk to you very soberly." l "Wait till another day," he cried, gayly. "* At present, I am. so happy, that I cannot speak one sensible word. What a beautiful little hand you have, Helen! Andwhy do you wear this ring? Who gave it to you?" "Are you suspicious already?" "Immensely!" "It was my mother's gift.* "'And the emerald?" "My father's."- Th/en, the torquoise?" I bought that, one day, while I was shop- ping." "Lend it to me." "Certainly." She slioped it from her finger; and placed it on his own hand. "'Look! it fits I Wear it Clifford; will you?" "On one condition." "What is that?" "That, when I come to-morrow, you allow, me to supply itsplaee. I want it for a mea- sure. Will you wear my ring, Helen?' "You know I will."  She gave a little happy sigh as' she spoke. It was all so strange-and yet So sweet. "Do you know; now, love, which way my fancy turned when Regina used to disappoint me?" he whispered. "Not toward me?" "Yes-Leoline r! The blood flew to her cheek and brow. "O Clifford what made yoo call me by hat name?" *I told you, last evening, that I had not for- 'otten the song you once sung to me." But why should you apply it so?' "How?" Sie gave him a look. A mist seemed to flear suddenly away from his visioU; "Helen!" he said, sitting donti beside her,   and taking her handi 'if I had spoken then-- the day you sung that song-what would your answer have been?" Her face was crimson; but she could not utter a falsehood, and, after' a moment's pause, the answer came, sweet and clear  "What it has been note, Clifford '" "My own love! And while I hate been roaming up and down the world, lonely and dissatisfied, Helen's heart has been following me-Helen's prayers, .perhaps?" "Yes; I prayed for you every night and morning!" she said, Bimnply. He covered his eyes with the hand that was free. "I wish I had known it, Helen. We should both have been spared very much suffering." "I am not sure that I would have missed it, dear Clifford 1" baid a gentle voice. "We shall both be happier for having undergone it.' "So many years wasted l" he murmured, looking sorrowfully at her. "Not wasted!" "'By me, certainly. I have not turned my disappointments to any good use-they only made me more selfish-more irritable-" "Stop!" she cried, laying her hand upon his lips. "You forget that 'you belong to me, now, and that I will not have myfprop- erty undervalued." '    , "'Ah!. Helen-Helen! it is worth so very little!" he answered, kissing the little hand. *' I wish, with all my heart, I was a better man!" "It is never too late-" "To mend?" She nodded her head, and smiled archly. 't So the proverb says, Clifford." "You shall teach me how to verify it, my dear one. "With you by my side, I really think I may learn to be a little like what you would have me!"  "It will not be so, Clifford. 'I am not the- one to make you better." "What do you mean?" "You must look higher for help," she mur- mured, in a solemn way. His lips to,.hoed her forehead-with a rever- ent love. A little timepiece in the recess strutek the hour; and the paroquet uttered a shrill scream in the very ear of the old governess. ' "Caro is ready for his dinner, and reminds us of it, my child," she said, looking at Hlelen, with a smile. "A nd I am very sure that your poor mammta must be awake by this time." Helen sprang up, instantly, from her seat. Ai Am I to take that as a veiled hint for imy departure?" asked Oiiftord, rising also. "I think the veil is a very transparett one!" said Helen, with a smile. t' The faot is,l 'bught to have been in mamma's room more tlhan half an hour ago t, She must be wohdering what I am about!"    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6470-00000071"/> "Shall you tell her?" said Clifford, rog- uishly. "No-let papa do that!  She will be so angry." Poor child!" "But then your being in Parliament may make a difference-I hope it will. She used to think you very clever." "Rely upon it,-he will be utterly oblivious to all mv cleverness when she hears of this!" said CliffQor, gloomily. "What shall we do then?"- Wait!" said Helen, under her breath. "For what?" "For her consent!" "She may never give it!" Ah, yes; she loves me very dearly, after all; and I shall make George talk to her. He could always persuade her to' consent to any- thing!" *"May I come and see your father to-mor- row?" "If you like." "And then I must say three words to you- and put that little ring upon your finger!" "Very well"!" You are never to take it off till I can put another in its place. Will you promise this?" "Yes!" "Now I am going home. Do you go out this evening?" "To the opera, I believe." "I shall see you, then, again." "Shall you come to our box?" "Unless you give me orders to the con- trary." "No I But I wish you would bring Charle- mount with you. Your visit will not look so pointed, then, and mamma likes to see you and George together. She says you both acted nobly last evening.

"Will she ask you about me?" "Of course, She is dying with curiosity all this while, and had a fit of illness, simply that she might stay at home for my news." "Well, tell her I am very happy." "Nothing more?" Is not that enough?" She lifted her sweet eyes a moment, and he saw that they were full of tears. "If I do not say more, Clifford, it is because I cannot. My heart is so full that I find no words to speak 1"   "My own Helen i" He drew her closer to his side,' and kissed the golden head that rested so contentedly on his breast. "And you really lve me like this?" "Very much more than this, Clifford! It is not in you to see how dear you are to me!" * My little English girl I And I have won her after all! O Helen, it seems a thousand years ago since I first looked at you!' "How very ungallant!" she cried, starting away. "I think, after such a speech, you should go home at once. And pray romemher that you need not repeat all my confessions to Regina!" she added, with a saucy smile. "I shall have so many of my own to make, that yours will be safe," he answered. "Good- bye, my own Helen." Till to morrow?" "Till to-morrow--yes! My dear madame, have the goodness to imagine, for' one moment, that you possess no eyes I' The governess smiled, and turned her head away. When she looked round again, Clifford had gone, and Helen was quite ready to ac- company her to Mrs. Erlinford's room. *  *    *  * *  *  * The Earl of Charlemount, going to his room, to dress for dinner, before Clifford's arrival, ob- served a small oblong box lying on his toilet- table, and addressed to him He took it up, and cut the string mechanically, while he waited for Howe. A small parcel fell out, wrapped in silver paper. He removed it, and started back with an exclamation of surprise and dismay. A miniature, painted on an oval slip of ivory paper, and framed in gold, lay iu his hand; a letter was beside it, but it fell, dis- regarded, to the floor, while he gazed at the face, once so beautiful in his eyes, and still re- membered, though unseen for years. It was the picture of a young girl, whose simple russet dress contrasted strangely with the proud carriage of the head, and the won- derful beauty of the uplifted eyes. The com- plexion was daik, and bright, and clear-a deep color tinged the healthy cheek and the pout- ing lip-heavy braids of dark hair swept back, and formed a natural coronet above the broad forehead-and the eyes looked into his with a a glance half passionate,.half proud. He turned the case over. A mingled braid of fair and dark hair surrounded an infant's curl upon the other side. Beneath was engraved one word: "Alice." He dropped it from liis hand, and something like a groan burst from his lips. "Now, after all these years!" he murmured, "are the sins of my youth going to rise up and make Regina hate me? Who is there " .he added, starting up, as he heard a hand upon the look of the door. "It is me, niy lord," said a familiar voice, and Howe glided quietly in, and began to ar.   range his master's dressing-case, at the other - end of the room. 1 The first bell rang ten minutes ago, my lord," he said, at last, seeing the earl did not move. 4( Confound the first bell!" groaned the un- happy man. "Howe, it would be a charity if you would shoot me 1', "My lord!" I am in earnest! Where are those pistols -the revolvers? they were here the other day."  "They are v in the library, on the next floor, my lord," said Howe, hesitatingly. ' I ealeaned them yesterday, and put them into the private drawer of your writing-desk." "Well, you need not turn so white. I am not going to use them at present. But I wish-I wish," he added, half to himself, " to Heaven I had some one to advise me. Captain Grosve- nor is out of town, and-"  He sat down beside the table, and leaned his head upon his .hand, in bitter thought. Howe looked at him keenly for a moment; his quick eye also took note of the miniature upon the ta- ble and the letter on 'the floor. Then he ad- vanced near, and standing beside the earl, said humbly. ",My lord, I may be taking too great a liberty, but if I can serve you in any way I hope you will not hesitate to employ met" 4' You are very kind, Howe, but you are just the one man on earth who can do nothing for- Je in this affair." ( May I ask how that can be, my lord?:' "Perhaps I ought to say you are the one Ian on earth who will do nothing!" Howe was silent for a moment. l am sorry you think me so ungrateful, my lord," he said at last. "Ungrateful! Faith, man, 'tis I who have been ungrateful. And now I am paying for it." "My lord, I wish very much that I could help you, for I am sure you are dreadfully an- noypd."  "You may we! say that I Ah, if I could only trust you!" "You may, my lord, you. may!" The earl looking down, musingly, saw the letter on the carpet at his feet. Ha! a letter, too ,This is getting better and better every moment!" He picked it up, broke the seal, ran hurried- ly through its contents, and burst into a wild laugh. "1 must trust. you, Howe, whether I wish to or not. Do you remember Alice?"  "Alice, my lord? 1 think she has given me reason enough to remember her to the dayof my death." "Do you care for her still?" Howe gave a little, low, unpleasant laugh. " My lord, I hope yoq give me credit for bet. ter taste. Alice, if she is alive now-and I sup- pose she must be since we have heard nothing   to the contrary-is a reckless woman. I prefer youth, and beauty, and innocence, to age and vice." "You have no more heart than a stone. Look at that! By' Jove, though I love my wife with all my soul, I cannot look at that face without a twinge, of memory and of pain,' He heldout the picture as he spoke. But Howe lost not an. atom of his wonderful self- control. He gazed at ,it f'r a moment, and a slight smile played around his lips. "Good Heavens do you stand there and laugh at it? Why, you would have married her, if-if-" The earl paused, and had the grace to blush. "If you had not saved me the trouble, my lord," replied Howe, coolly, as he laid the pic- ture down. "I know it. But a man can af- ford to laugh at his stupidity after he has out- grown it, you know; and it is by no means the first time that m;ne has amused me." "Poor Alice . poer little creature I That is all she gets either from you or me. Well, what's to be done?"  "Has-she written to you, my lord?" "I should think so. Here is the letter. put stop I Do you know nothing of this matter, sir? How came this parcel on my dressing. ,table?" "I put it there, my lord, an hour ago,'  "The deuce you did! And did you know what it contained?'  "No, my lord." "Or who sent it?'" "No, my lord." "Well, who brought it to the house?" "A boy, my lord." "In livery." "No, my lord. A boy. out of the streets, I should say." "Did he ask for me?" "No, my lord. I was crossing the hall at the time, when I heard him tell the porter that it was to be given into the earl's own hands. JI went forward at once, but the boy was half-way down the street; so I took the package from Simmons and brought it. here myself." The earl's thoughts were far away, long be-' fore the explanation was concluded. He mused over the open letter for a time, and then gave it to the valet, "Well, there I see what she says. I hadly know whether to feel anxious 'about it or not." Not a muscle of the man's face changed as he perused the brief, threatening note: "MY LORD CHABLEMOUNM: It is many years since you left me in Paris; and during those years you have been rich and happy, while I have been Door and wretched i Is it not time to turn the scales?

"Yours, as you choose, AICE GRANTLEY." Howe folded the note carefully. As he did so, a few words on the outer edge caught his eye, and he read them aloud: "I shall bring the boy with me. He is like his father!" "That would be rather awkward, my lord." "The boy! What boy!" cried' the earl. "You don't mean that, that-" Alice had a son, my lord, six months after you returned to England!" "The deuce!" "I always supposed you knew it, my lord." * Not I. And why on earth did she never tell me this before?" "Heaven knows!" said Howe, shrugging his shoulders. "The ways of Heaven are past finding out, sometimes, my lord!" "A boy! my son! After keeping quiet all these years, they must both turn up like this 1 What am I to do, Howe? I would rather lose my coronet than haveker enter this house." "A coronet is a heavy stake to lose!" said Howe, with a queer look. "But there is a way of preventing the visit." By going to --- Place, you mean?" "Yes, my lord.-' "If it was at any other time. But how can I absent myself to-day? Mr. Clifford dines here, and I can hardly leave the countess to en- tertain him, considering all things. It would be rather awkward, don't you see, Howe?" A smile played around Howe's thin lips, but he tools good care to keep it concealed from his master's eyes. "I see no other way, my lord!' he observed. "Alice is quite capable of doing as she hbs said, and though the porter might send ler away, it would hardly be without a disturb- ance. Such a disturbance," he added, point- edly, " as her ladyship would be pretty sure to inquire into, and get at the bottom of." The earl groaned. "Good Heaven I I'm the most unfortunate fellow on earth! These things all happen to me, but they don't happen to other men. Look at that Ruth! What a narrow escape I had there!" "Ruth lies still in her grave now, my lord!" The earl turned pale, and shivered. "Don't talk about graves, Howe. If the girl chose to die because I loved Regina best, was it my fault? And here is Alice, who never cared half so much for tne as poor Ruth did, worrying me far. worse. Heaven knows what women were made for. I don't, unless it was to plague our lives out!" He ceased speaking, and glanced at the por- trait moodily. I don't suppose it crossed his mind for one moment that any one was injured by the existing state of things except himself. Alice was not, in his eyes, the gay young girl whose innocence he had destroyed, and whose life he had wrecked; but a middle aged woman t   -desperate, and probably ugly-who would eo deavor to, turn Regina's heart against him, un. less he acceded to every absurd request she chose to make for the future, and who might at any moment cover him with shame a id confu- sion by placing her own base born child side by side with that fair son, who was the, darling of his own aud his mother's heart. "If I could be sure that the mere payment of a sum of money, would end the matter, I would not care what IF gave!' he said, at lust. "' But I know Alice better than ever ou di l, Howe; and I can tell you that she has the malice of a fiend, when she is roused. If she has taken it into her head that I am to dance attendance on her at S-- Place, you ,may rely upon it that she will summon me there three days out of the seven, and at the most unheard-of times; and if I refuse to go I shall have her here-" "My lord, I beg your pardon for interrupt. ing you; but the second bell is just ringing, and you have no. time to spare. Come what may, you must dress." The earl submitted to the duties of the toi- let, gnawing his lip viciously all the while. As he turned to leave the room, he looked at Howe.      "You have got me out of many scrapes; see me safely through this one, and you may name your own reward!" "Do not fear, my lord!" was the quiet re- ply. ' You will get through with it!' "And well?" "And well!" "How will you manage?" "You will receive a note while you are at dinner, which you must show to her ladyship. It will explain your departure, and I will have the brougham in readiness. You can reach Alice by half-past seven, and be back here be- fore Mr. Clifford has joined her ladyship in tie drawing-room., "That will do!" cried the earl, with a re- lieved air. "Howe, you hale taken a moun- tain from my breast! What should I have done all through life without you?" He hurried down the stairs, excited and' re. lieved. Howe, left behind, took up the picture of Alice, and looked at it steadily. "What would you have done without me through life?' he whispered.!"What indeed, George Erlinford?" He pressed the portrait to his lips with pas- sionate exultation. "* The time has come, lost Alice!" he mur mured, as if the senseless ivory could hear and rejioe with him--"the time has come for which we have waited so long; and it is your hand and mine together that will hold the bit- ter cupto his lips. Ah, Alice! revenge is even sweeter than love I Doyou not find it so P?" A footstep outside startled him ; and, hiding picture and letter carefully in his b east, he /   I-,fe the room-once again the sober, sedate, ** confidential servant," and nothing more! Clifford, radiant with his new happiness, re- ceived the congratulations of Regina, when he came, so gratefully, that he had no leisure to notice the somewhat excited manner of his host. Regina looked across the table, now and then, at her husband, with wonderful. eves. Never before had she seen him so gay and animated; never before had she noticed just that flush Xupon his cheek, or that light within his eye. "Do you feel ill, my lord?' she asked, at last. "You look half merry and half sad," "Jll? I was never better in my life I Ah I what is this 9" he added, as Howe entered, and presented a note upon a salver." "I A letter, my lord, which was to be delivered immediately." "Is the bearer waiting?" "No, my lord." Charlemount broke the seal, and read as fol- lows; "MY DEAR GEORGE: I have just ' come to grief,' and want to see you. The bay mare (you always said she was shaky) has done my business at last, almost! The stupid brute fell down with me, to-day, in lyde Park; and while she took care to come off sound in wind and limb, she-treated me to a broken collar-bone and sun- dry bruises, which are anything but agreeable. I'm alonein my hotel, hipped to death. Willyou come an say five words to me? I wish to consult you about a- business matter-at once, if possible "Yours, disconsolately, TOM GRBOVENOR. With an admirably counterfeitea expression of concern, the earl communicated the contents of this note to Beginaand Clifford. Regina's eyes were full of sympathy at once. * Poor Captain Grosvenor!" "He always was unlucky, from his youth upl" said Charlemount, evidently hesitating about going on with his dinner. 'Send word to the hotel, Howe, that I will come in three or four hours." "Three or four hours, my dear Charle- mount!" said Regina. "Sureely you will not be so cruel. Mr. Clifford, I know, will excuse you, and you can join-us again at dessert. Do go and see what be wants! I shall be misera- ble if I have to think of him expecting you every moment, when you are sitting quietly under my very eyes, eating your dinner, as if you had hot a friend in the world." "Yes-go, my lord, by all means," said Clifford. "Surely you will not stand upon ceremony with an old friend like me I If I was in Captain Grosvenor's place, and he in mine, I know that I should think it very unkind in you to sip your wine while I was tumbling from one side of the bed to the other,'and mut- tering curses-not loud, but deep-upon shaky bay mares and unsound collar-bones." '. Well, 1 supp,.se I must go," said the earl, rising from his chair. "Tell them to bring-the roughamn round, Howe. I am. sorry, Mr. Clif- ford, that our quiet little party should be so unceremoniously disturbed; but I will endeav-   or to join you again at your wine. You will find the claret worth your undivided atten- tion."       . With a stately bow to his guest and his wife, he turned away. ASa obsequious servant held' the door open; but Oharlemount'paused for a moment upon the threshold. Was it a presen- 'timent of coming evil that made him give that long, lingering glance at the woman for whose sake he had lent himself to so much of decep- tion and dishonor? Did he take a mute, un- conscious farewell of happiness and her. in that one pause of doubt and' uncertainty? Ah, CharlemountI even then it was not too late! One candid, tearful confession-one prayer for pardon-and by Heaven and by Regina you had been forgiven, and loved once more I She smiled, and waved her hand, as he stood look- ing at her for a few moments.  Howe waited till the earl's carriage drove away, and then went up stairs, musingly, till he reached a small but wel-furnished chamber near the roof. which was dedicated to his sole use. The floor was carpeted, and the wails covered wi h a pretty paper; there were flow- ers under the bird cage in the window,; there was a picture hanging on the wall. Possibly, if the earl had ever visited this cheerful little apartment. He might have had less confidence in his valet, for it was, the counterpart of the miniature that smiled down upon all beholders here. But he knew nothing of Howe's "*sur- roundings" or personal possessions, nor did he wish to know.' The canary, rolled up into a ball, with hi, head under his yellow wing, only gave a sleepy little chirrup as his master covered the cage with a cloth. A handsome, bold-looking youth was amusing himself by penciling the name "G. Erlinford" on the window seat, and sur, rounding it with dashing flourishes. Howe looked over his shoulder for a moment, smiling to himself, and then went up to two women who, occupied easy-chairs at the farther end of the room. One of them was very old, though a faint color still lingered on her withered cheeks, and her eyes brightened at the approach of Howe.  "Does the lady want me'?" she asked, laok. ing up eagerly into his face, which was a little flushed. "Not just yet, Dame Godwin. Sit quietly rere for a few moments longer; we will not keep you very late! Have you had some wine?"  "Alice gave me half a glass, and then she put it away in the cupboard again. She might have given me a whole one; it isn't often a poor old woman like me gets to taste of such. - wine as that, you know 1"       - "I suppose Alice thought it might get into your head, dame, and that would- be bad for y- ur atory. But I will give ypu another glass, and orne bisouits with it."    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6470-00000073"/> He produced a decanter from a corner cup. board, and placed a bumper before the old wo- man. "There, dame! drink the Earl of Charle- mount's health!" "Ah, yes, my pretty boy!" murmured the poor old soul, her hands trembling so that she could scarcely lift the glass to her lips. "I always knew he was alive! God bless him!" Howe turned to the otheriwoman, who sat with her hands clasped upon her knee, looking steadily at the picture of the young girl on the wall. "Well, Alice!" She started and turned round. Surely that face and form are-not unknown to us! It is Mrs. Maiinig, the housekeeper of the Wilver- ton Cottage, and yonder youth is he for whose sake Roberts was dismissed. "Well, ha- he gone?" she asked, abrubtlv. "This moment.' "What did he say?" "Nothing that you would llce to hear." That, of course. But I must know." In a low voice, and leaning on her chair Howe told her all. She listened without a word. When he had finished, she stood up and looked first at the portrait and then at him. "And this is the man for whom that silly girl left h-me, and reputation-and you?" ' Yes!" he said, sadly, as he also glanced at the girlish face, so different from the dark-lined Countenance of the woman. She laid her hand upon his arm. "If I faltered for a moment when you first proposed this to me, you did well to bring me face to face with the ghost of my youth. I am as eager now. as you can be, to revenge myself on him. Shall we go?" ' Wait one moment," said Howe, taking the hand in both his, and speaking under his breath. "When our work is done here, shall we two meet no more alive?" "Can you wish it?" she asked, briefly. "Once, you would have been my wife, if-if he had not come between us." She glanced at him, and sighed. "Why do you speak of that, now?" "Through him we have been separated all these years. Why should we not spend the last as we would have speat the first?P' "Together?" "Yes." She drew her hand slowly trom his. The red blood flushed her face, and she gave him a look that spoke volumes. This I did not expect from you! You might have spared me-- Her voice faltered, and covering her face with her hands she burst into tears. The old woman looked up at her from her biscuits. "What has he been saying to you, Alice? Never mind him; he always did like to tease you! Try some of this wine. It will make   you forget there is such a thing as trouble ia the- world." How dare you insult my mother?" cried the boy, coming forward and putting his arrm round her waist. "Look up, mother! Don't cry; no one shall make you cry while I am here!" Howe gazed at him a moment, with a blend. ed feeling of pleasure and pain. The lad's bravery pleased him, and his quick defence of Alice went to his heart;' but he spoke to him with the voice of long ago, and it was almost a{ if his father had been there again-- oung, ano generous, and beloved, as he once had been Howe's eyes were dim as he said: "Don't be foolish, George-though I like you for taking her part! And, Alice, listen to me! I don't care who hears me say it! I have loved you all this time; I have never loved any other woman; and it was only as uy wife that I meant you to stay with me I If you will marry me, I will try and make you happy -and this boy shall find me a better friend than his own father,has ever been to him!" "You cannot mean it!" "I really do!"' "After all these years, and all that-- "Husn!"' said Howe. "We will speak of nothing but the present time. Will you take my name, and share my home-that is the question now? George, I think, will say a good word in my behalf, now that you are convinced I mean no harm!" "That I will!" said the lad, stoutly. "Take him, mother dear, and we will go abroad, aod live in dear old Germany, and be the three hap- piest people in the world!"   ' Adice'smiled sadly, as she brushed the hair from his forehead and kissed him. Then she held out her hand to Howe. "I do not deserve such kindness now ; but I will try to make you very happy," she said, humbly. Howe kissed her. It was the first time their lips had met for years; and yet the touch thrilled through all his frite, as it had done in his boyhood. Like his master, he had many faults; but, like his master, he also had one grand virtue-he could be faithful to the woman he really loved, when once he had won her. Alice looked anxiously at the timepiece above their heads. "Surely we ought to go.' "Yes, I suppose so. But you left a note for him at 5--   Place?" "Yes" "How long did you ask him to wait?" "An hour. But he may grow impatient, and risk my coming here." "Not he. He would stay there till midnight, rather than meet you under this roof-espe- cially since he knows her ladyship will accept; his excuse for the long delay. Nevertheless, as it is always best to be on the safe side, we will go. They must have done with dessert by   this time, and I shall not scruple to call Mr. Clifford from the dining-room. Hare you the papers?" "They are all here," said Alice, placing a pocket book in his hand." "Come, then." And what is to become of me?" cried the old woman. "How long am I to be kept from my precious boy?" "tOnly a few moments, mother," said Alice, soothingly. "George will stay with you till I come' back; and when you have been down stairs, you shall have more wine." "Like this 9" Yes." "Well, go then. But mind that you don't keep me waiting too long, or I shall fall asleep. I have not had my nap to-day; and I never go through the twenty-four hours without my nap. You ought to know that, Alice."' "i Yes, mother; but you will be sure to keep awake a little longer, for the sake of your boy. And George will talk to you.' They went diown the stairs together. Regina had already entered the drawing-room; they could hear her voice, and that of Stuart's, blending pleasantly in song and laughter. "Is it the child?*' whispered Alice, as they stood upon the landing-place. "Yes. Would you like to see him?" "No!" she answered, shrinking back. "Poor little fellow, it seems hard for him. does it not?" "Think of your own boy, Aliee-think of what he should have been!" "True!" and the pitying look passed from her face. "It must be done!" "Of course. Wait here for a few moments." And he opened the door of an unused ante- room. "I will come for you when it is time." Alice entered, and sat down beside the win- dow. Howe went swiftly down the stairs, and knocked at the dining-room door before he en- tered. Clifford looked up from the walnut he was peeling. "Ah, Howe! Can you tell me that wonder ful piece of news here?" "No, my lord-that is, sir-I beg your par- don," said Howe, confusedly. "I must trouble ,ou to go into the drawing-room, at once, if it is not taking too great a liberty to ask such a thing. Her ladyship is concerned in the mat.' ter as well as you.' Clifford's face flushed hotly. What could this mysterious communication be, in which Regina also bore a part. He loCked'keenly at the man a moment, and then dismissing from his mind the momentary suspicion that he had been drinking, rose and 'followed him without a word. Regina  welcomed him  with a smile, as he entered the drawing-room; but stared the next moment, with surprise, at see- ing Howe following him in, and closing the door behind him. , 10   CHAPTER XIV. For thee shall blase no household hearth- Thy steps shall never come To'some sweet quiet from the world, And call it softly "home!" No children watching atithe gate, With laughter clear and sweet; No wife to rise, with loving eyes, Her wanderer to meet.-M. B. It was strange neither Regina nor Clifford -seemed to resent or question this extraordinary behavior on the part of a servant. A name- less, instantaneous presentiment ovelthelmed them both; even the child seemed to, fee in- stinctively that trouble and shame brooded over those he loved; for, leaving his play, he came and leaned against his mother's knee, and placed his little hand softly in hers. Howe was the first to speak. "I seem to be taking a great liberty, my lady ;, but I think you will forgive me. I have things to say that no one but ourselves ought to hear." Regina's eyes turned toward the child. "He must not stay," she whispered to Clif- ford. "Certainly not. And yet I do not know what we are going to hear." "My lady," said Howe, "I will take Lord Erlinford up stairs, if you will permit me, and return to you." "Very well," said Regina. "Be geood, Stu- art, dear, and go with Howe. Mamma will come, presently." The child went quietly away. Silently those two awaited the servant's return. Their hearts were too full of doubt and fear to admit of a single word. Howe coming back, hesitated for a moment before closing the door.  "My lady, the story I am about to tell is so very strange. that I shall need a witness of its truth to make you believe it. One waits in the ante room; may I bring her in at once?. It may save remarks among the servants." "Do as you please," said Regina, feeling ut- terly bewildered. Howe stepped across the hall, held a parley at the door of the ante-room, and returne, with Alice, who dropped an embarrassed court- esy, and retreated to the most shadowy corner. of the room. Regina's noble and graceful ape. pearance impressed her strongly; her heart was softened, moreover, by the glimpse shehat obtained of Stuart's golden head, and sweet, fair face; and it needed many a thought ,i' the nameless boy up-stairs to make her equal once more to the part she had to play. But it was too late to go back now, though she longed to do so. They were all there together, as she had so often dreamed they would be, and Howe was speaking, "I should like to be allowed to tell this story in my own way, my lady." "Go on, then." "Years ago, lthere was a poer boy sorvilng in the stables of a nobleuau in i----,a tre, U    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6470-00000074"/> had born upon the estate; and there was not a tree or shrub about the ground that he did not love with his whole heart. The house was empty, and the family were abroad, with the exception of a son-the only son-who was a schoolboy at Eton. But the little stable-boy dreamed always of their coming home, and of the devotion which he should pay to them, and which would end only with his life. "The young heir was very wild, even from his first boyhood; and it was said that his con- duet was fast breaking his mother's heart. I'hey had taken her to Italy, after leaving him in charge of a strict, stern tutor, and in Italy a second son was born. The lady died soon after, but still his lordship lingered abroad. Some said that he was about to marry again; others, that he was entangled in an intrigue with an opera-dancer; others, that he was too poor to live in England. But, at last, much to tile surprise of all who gossiped so freely about him, he returned." "He was not alone. The boy-the second son-accompanied him. He was a gay, frank, courageous fellow, very different from his brother, and as affectionate and warm-hearted as any human being could well be. His father idolized him, and the Italian nurse who accom- panied them seemed only to live, move, and breathe for him. She died-poor thing!-not long after they returned, and the old lord never held hie head up afterward. People said the reckless conduct of his heir was sending him to his grave; but one knew better. Giula, the Italian, was buried in the family vault near the house; and the little stable-boy saw him i here one evening, kneeling and crying like a child. The body of his wife had been sent back to England, and was buried in the same i-lace; but he shed no tears over her tomb- they were all for Giula. The boy wondered, thell, how such a thing could be but it was some time  before he solved the mystery. And, meanwtlile, he was devoted to the young- er son. They played together all day long; they rode, they hunted, they fished side by aide; and if his lordship at any time resented ouch an intimacy, one word from his darling would soothe him again, and induce him, not only to tolerate, but to encourage it. By way, however, of making the relation less objection- able, the lad was promoted from the stable, and followed his young master no less affec- tionately, that he was known in the house as his own especial servant. It was a happy time, although it could not last long. Am 1 tiring you, my lady?' "  No!" said Regina, who, with her face half- hidden by her hand, was listening intently. "They were together at school-not ad Eoglieh, but a German one-and afterward at a university. The servant studied far harder than his master, and received from him, not only books and time. hut assistance and en- couragenment of every kind. He had a thirst   'for knowledge; he was happy in its pursuit, and he loved the kind hand and heart that aided him with all the ardor of his nature. Do you think such a love could ever fail or change, my lady?"' Regina looked up, surprised at this question It depends," she said, very slowly. "It did change, my lady, and I will tel you how. The old lord died suddenly, and they were summoned home. The new lord was at Oxford, but he left it on the day of his major. ity, and west abroad. His health was very delicate; but, in spite. of that, he plunged into every dissipation that could be found iu Paris." "' In Paris?" said Regina, turning very pale, "Yes, my lady. He died there, in his twentty third year." "Ah!" She placed her hand suddenly upon her heart. The story was growing more clear to her, though Clifford still looked puzzled and bewildered. "In the meantime, the younger son remained at his ancestral home. He was fond of his brother; there were only a few years between them, and they had been much together in the intervals of school and college. The last wish of his heart was, that his brother should die; but as there was a large provision made for him by his father's will, an i he was his own master, he thought it incumbent upon him it ' follow that brother's example, which (if I may be allowed to say so much) was not a good one. Since he was not the lord, he would, at least, ape the lord's vices. And he began in a very promising way." Howe paused, and looked toward the shrink. ing figure in the corner. "Shall I go on?" he whispered; " or would you prefer to go back into the other room a few moments?" Alice did not answer. But she made a hur- ried gesture of assent, that attracted Regina's attention. "There was a girl, my lady, who dwelt at the park gates of that old hall, with her father, the lodge-keeper," he said, with a slight tremor in his voice. "Her mother had gone abroad with the family, when she was a little child, as nurse to the lady, and had died-so it was said -in Italy. Her father mourned for her in her quiet way, and gave himself up to his little child. No girl was ever more carefully tended, more truly loved, thanm--Alice!" The woman behind him sat down, and buried her face in her hands, as he pronounced that name; and Regina fancied she heard a sob. "She was beautiful, and graceful, and young -pure, too, as a lily-and the servant loved her dearly 1" said. Howe, slowly. "He would have laid down his life for her, and told her so. They were Up be married; and, by the advice of his young master, he went away for a time to a farm, at some distance, belonging to the   estate, which was to be his upon his wedding- day, He made the little home neat and gay for his young bride, and returned for her. But she was gone!" Gone!" cried Clifford, watching the cower- ing figure in the corger, and in his turnube- ginning to comprehend the story. "* Gone.. where?" "A broad, sir. God knows what temptations had been held out to her! She was young and giddy; and perhaps," he added, with a trem- bling voice, *an-I perhaps she loved him then better than the plain, awkward man she was to marry. He was loveable enough, if that-was all." "Who, Hwe?" The-the young master, sir," was the low \answer. There was a long silence. Clifford asked, at length: "What happened next, Howe?" "Not much. He returned, in a little time, to England." "With her?" "No, sir." "Where was she?" "I will answer that question!" cried the wo- man behind him, starting up suddenly. "She was alone, and ill, in a poor lodging in Paris; there she would have starved, if it had not been for the kindness of sonme. Sisters of Char- ity, who found her'in their rounds. She loved him-she left everything for him-he deceived her by a false marriage-and then deserted her and htr unborn child, and left them to starve, if they chose 1" "Are you Alice?" asked Regina, lising too, "I amn Alice!" "And the child?" "He is under your roof, at this moment. You shall see him before he goes." "Sit down," murmured Regina, sinking back into her own chair, and covering her eyes with her hand. "'Go on, Howe, I must hear all' now I What did this servant do when his mas- ter returned?" What could he do, my lady?" "Did he attempt his life?" "Oh, no!" said Howe, with a strange smile. "That would have been a poor revenge I If the thought came to him in his first despair, he banished it. iHe forgave him " She looked at him intently. "Howe, to this day he has not done that i" "W 11, my lady, he appeared to do so. His master was satisfied, and took him back into his service." Clifford and Regina exchanged looks. "And then?"    ' "Perhaps his master felt remorse for what he had done; for he was but a boy, after all. He went to London, 'to see life,' as he said. And he saw it. He took an odd fancy to the study of-medicine, and walked the hospitals, for six months or so. The servant was always   with him; and there was scarcely a scene of vice and shame in this great, wicked city to which he did not introduce the boy. His ruin -temporal and eternal-seemed an easy thing, when his brother died suddenly, and through his title and fortune he was restored once more to respectability. So ends the'first part of the tale." "It is a more horrible one than I have ever heard 1" said Clifford, shuddering at the thought of the vindictive spirit that had haunted its victim through so many years. "There is worse to come," was the brief re- ply. "My lady, do you recognize the charac- ters in the story?" "Yes." "And you, sir?' "It would ,be difficult not to do so," replied Clifford. It was strange that neither thought for one moment of contradicting or disbeliev. ing it.  "Then I may drop all disguises, and pass over some years of Lord Charlemount's life with little notice. He married, as you know,  and broke his wife's heart. But this is too common an amusement to alarm any one, and wives are used to it. He went abroad'after Lady Erlinford's death. Many women loved him; and the Italian Marchesa' was the only one who was ready to sacrifice everything to him. In 'spite of his inconstancy and insel- fishness, there was something so grand about the man's nature, that I could scarcely wonder, at their infatuation. If 'be had not wronged me as he did, I should have shared in it, and forgiven him." "Remember," said Regina, sadly, i that you are speaking of my husband, and the father of my child I Also, that he is absent, and cannot defend himself!" "My lady, I must speak the truth, whatever it may cost you. And your own heart tells you that it is the truth. He will be here soon. Let him deny one word of it, if he can!" "Go on."  "Among the many women who, as I have 'already said, loved the earl, was one far too good and gentle for the fate she met with. She was, a, danseuse, and the fairest creature, save two, my eyes have ever looked upon. She was innocent as a child before she saw him. She never loved another. Yet, in .a short time, he deserted her, as he had deserted so many others.' "Her name?" said Regina, almost in a whisper. "Upon the stage, she won, by ler light and beautiful dancing,' the name of The Zephyr. But her real name was-" "Ruth!" cried Regina, in a' terrible voice. "Iy 4od I did he dare to wrong her?" "  ie killed ner" t" "tlow?"           ' "My lady, he had no half brother Henry."    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6470-00000075"/> "Was it Charlemount who wrote those let- ters to her at Paris?" "I wrote them for him, because he would have no evidence brought against him after- ward." "Was it Charlemount who met her at the cottage window?" "It was." Regina gasped for breath, and held out her /hand, as if for support, to Clifford. "My friend, what have I done that I should have married this man?" "You see, Regina, that I was less unjust than you thought me. I knew it was the earl," he whispered, unable, even at that moment, to resist the temptation of vindicating him- self.. "Hush i" she said, coldly. "What are your wrongs or mine to Ruth's? Howe, did she go to meet him on the next day?" "She did, my lady!" "Where?" "To a cottage at Wilverton, in --shire!" "Was he there?" "How could he be?" cried Clifford. '"Have you forgotten that we fought that very even- ing?" "Ah, I remember! But, Howe, this seems so dark to me I If he was not with her, why did she stay there so contentedly?" "She was not contented, my lady!" "How do you know?" I saw her twice." "By his request? ' "Yes, my ladiy." *"And what did you tell her?" "That business kept him-but that she was to be ready to marry him as soon as he ar- rived!" Tears fell fast from Regina's eyes as she im- agined her dead friend watching eagerly for his coming who had no thoughts for her. "And 'you dare to stand there, Howe, and tell me quietly I Had you no feeling-no pity for the poor child, whose only fault was that she loved him so?" "My lady, if it had been my own sister, she would have been sacrificed as Ruth was. If it had been Alice, even-dearly as I loved her all my life long-she would have been second to my plan of revenge. You asked if I attempted his life, and I told you no. I did much more --I gave him my own. But it was only that every hour of it might be employed in bring- ing about the events that have happened to him, and are happening now. If I have sold myself to a terrible master, for the sake of accomplishing this revenge, at least, I am re- ceiving the reward he promised, and while I can enjoy it. Ruth-beautiful and gentle as she was- could be nothing more than another item in the long account of crime I was .tppt- ing that man to swell. I had no pity, no com- passion to waste on any creature that fur-   thered that plan of mine. Shall I go on, my lady?" Regina was locking at him with a mute and terrified face. "Yes. you may go on," she- said, as she wiped away her face. II can hear nothing much worse than this. The letter, Howe-the letter?" "What letter, my lady?" "The one he brought to me-from her?" "She never saw it!" "And did she know that I was about to mar- ry him?" "Yes, my lady." "Who told her? Not the earl?" ' No; he had the grace to send me instead." "My poor"Ruth!" "She was confined, by his orders, at the eot. tage; and the people of the village were told that she was mad. Yet, in spite of bolts and bars, she escaped that very evening after she heard the truth of the story, and came up to London. My lord saw her the morning you married him." Regina's brow grew dark., "Before or after the ceremony?" "After my lady. They found her in Park Lane, with a group of boys and men around her. She ha' wandered about all night, but she recognized Lord Charlemount at once; and he took her home with him in the brougham. It was this that made him so late in joining you at the cottage. He was obliged to dis- pose of his victim, before he could meet his wife." "Howe,' said Regina, disregarding his taunt, "it was some time before you joined us abroad. Where were you?" "' At Wilverton, my lady." "With her?" "Yes, my lady." "Why did you stay?" "I was needed, my lady," was the mysteri. ous reply; and Regina turned pale. "You are keeping something back from me! What is it?" "I wish you would ask Alice, my lady." "What can she know of Ruth P" Alice came forward, looking almost as pale as the countess herself. "I was the housekeeper at the cottage, my lady." '"You! Surely, he never put you there? He was not so lost to all delicacy and hoior as to put you into any relation with her?" "I know little of the 'earls delicacy or hon or!" said Alice, with a bitter smile. "But be did not know that Mrs. Maining and Alice were one. It was Howe who got the place for me, and for my boy. It was Howe who sought me out after he returned from Paris; in fact, it is Howe who has done everything!" Howe smiled as if be had received the great- est compliment, when Regina turned her dark, haughty glance upon him   "I would not be in your place. Even the earl, bad as he is, would never have wronged o' u, as you have wronged him I There is no treachery like that which aims a blow at us from our own hearthstone!" ** I agree with your ladyship," was the care. less reply. "But was not his planned and. plotted upon mine?" She could not, answer, In spite of all con- fleiting personal feelings, the three could see that, according to the world's code of "an vye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," the Man was in the right. As for him,.no doubt had ever crossed h:s mind. '"Justice, though th e heavens fall," had been his stern motto through all those weary years. The argu- nwents that rose to her lips were unspoken- the words of a milder doctrine: "If thy brother offend thee, forgive him; not seven times only, but seventy times seven," would have been lost upon him, exulting in the hour so lunged for, yet waited for as patiently as the red Indian waits upon the trail of his unwary foe. There was &amp; savage part in her own nature which had been lying dormant for years; and for a moment it stirred and thrilled in unison with his. It was in her, at one time, to have hated with such intensity as this, though her vengeance would have been swifter, and, possibly-not so sure; and, feel- ing this, she held her. peace. "Line upon line, and precept upon precept" should not be wanting, to that unhappy man; but she must be calmer first-she must have learned thoroughly to forgive the sufferings and death of Ruth. She could not do that now. "Well, Alice," she said, sighing, as she took up the sickening examination again, "( tell me, since he refuses to do it, why he staid with you?" "Ruth was so violent, my lady, that the doctor thought it unsafe for me to be alone with her, till Howe had shown me how to manage her. She was always quieter with him!" Regina started. "Was she-did she lose her reason?" "He brought her to the cottage a raving maniac, on the very day you left England!" said Alice, with sad distinctness. "Did the earl know it?' "No, my lady. Till she oied,he never knew how ill she had been." Thank God for that 1" cried Regina. "It is something to hear one word in his favor. But my poor Ruth-my poor Ruth I Did she die in that dreadful state?" "No; she had her senses when she died." "Did she speak of me P" Your name was the last word upon her lips, my lady.", Regina turned away her head. "Was there no message-no token?" "This, my lady!" and in the outstretched ,    hand Alice placed a small ivory, box. Regina opened it, and started as a tress of soft brown hair fell clinging around her fingers. It seemed as if it was alive, and she pressed it to-her lips, crving out,'passionately: "Oh, Ruth! Ruth I Ruth l"i There was not a dry eye in the room,'for even Howe was touched and moved by the artless burst of grief. Alice said, through her tears; "She sent her love to you, my lady; and to him-my lord-her forgiveness." There was a long silence. At last Regina rose, and turned to Clifford. "I must go." "Where?"' "Anywhere! I will take my boy, and ask Helen to give me shelter for a time. I esnnot see his face again till I have partially forgot- ten this. He told me she died in Germany, with his brother watching beside her bed." Clifford looked perplexed. "You had best stay and meet him, Regina. It must be sooner or later. Why not to-day, and then all the memory will be over at once." "To think," she said, in the same low tone, "that for all these years he has lived this ter- rible life I And I have trusted him so-[ have ,pleased myself with the thought, that, however false or insincere the world at large might be, there was nothing but the frankest truth, and the purest acts and motives, in my own happy home!" "At least he has been true to you!" said Clifford, who felt that he could afford to say something in his rival's favor now. "Yes," she answered, evasively; "in one sense of the word, he has been true; but in ariother-oh, I cannot bear to think of it'l , If he, who has seemed so frank and generous. and kind, can be all that these two say (and I feel in my heart that they speak the truth), what hope have I in my bo -in his child? I wish he was in his grave. It would not be so bard to weep over him now as it will be hereafter." "Take comfort," whispered Clifford. "You are his mother: and it is thenother who gives and who forms the higher ngaire of the child "' "Ah " she said, simply, "that does not console me in the least; I know my own faults so well. I never wished the child to resemble me; but I thought he might be as frank aud noble as I believed his father to be.

"Ruth herself forgave him-she would not wish you to say this!" said Clifford. " do not know. At this moment I feel only two things-that I hate him, and that my heart is broken!" Her voice trembled, and her head drooped. "Sit down, Regina," said Clifford, passing his arm around her waist, as he saw how fast her strength was leaving her. "Lean on me." She obeyed. He knelt beside her chair, and watched her anxiously. The mortal paleness passed from her face. She leaned toward him, with a weary look in her beautiful eyes. "Clifford! if it wtre not for my boy, I should like to die!" "Poor child l" he said, using, unconscious- ly, one of the old pet names he had been used to bestow upon her in the brief season of their betrothal. But how differently he said it- how differently she listened-now! "Oh, if you have a secret like this!" she said, suddenly, " tell Helen, before you marry her. It will be far better." "Regina!" "Oh, don't be angry with me. I dare say you have none. I only spoke because the thought struck me. Clifford, my. dear friend! what am I to do?" "I cannot tell"I "Will you not take me to Helen?" "Now?" "Yes l" "Will it not be better to see him first? Howe, when will the earl return?" Howe looked at his watch. "We must send for him, sir." Something significant in the man's tone at. tracted Regina's attention. "Howe, did he really go to Captain Gros-' venor V' "Captain Grosvenor is in Paris, my lady." "But the note?" "It was written by me." Again!" cried Regina. "Is there not one action quite sincere? Why did you write it?" "It was necessary that he should be absent while we came to this explanation with you. He nevtr knew of Alice's return to England, or the existence of her son, till to-day. She wrote to inform him of the one-I told him of the other." "And what did he say?" 'At my suggestion, Alice proposed -or rather, demanded-a meeting with him in 8-- Place; and told him if he failed to keep the appointment, he would find her here this   evening. He dared not disregard the message, but he begged me to arrange the matter in such a way that you should not surmise the cause of his absence. 'So I broughtthe note to hiw from Captain Grosvenor.  It was the most plausible excuse I could invent, upon eo short a notice." "IBut Alice is here!" "And mv lord is at S--   Place, waiting for her. A note was left for him at her lodg., ings, saying that she was obliged to be absent a thort time on business, but: that he was en no account to leave the house till she caue,or sent a message for him. As the buesiness i dispatched-at least, as far as it can be with. out his presence -I think I may venture to send the message now." * Let me go before he comes!" said Regina, "My lady, you have not heard all.' "What more can there be?" "Much that you little dream of. I beg that you will stay." "' If he. sees you TTowe, after he finds that all is discovered, H4 will kill you," suggested Clifford. "'I am not afraid!" said Howe, quietly. And going out into the hall, he dispatched Roberts with the brougham, and a message that the countess wished to see the earl on business of the most vital importance, and begged tiht he would return at once. "That will bring him, I think," said Howe, as he walked up and down the hall, rubbing his hands together. and smiling to himself. This hour was well worth waiting for. It re. paid him a thousand-fold for all those years of endurance which, in spite of his patience, he had found so hard to bear. And to think that after all the revelations he had made, one yet remained, far more important, in the eyes in most people, than any which had gone before. His exultation was like that of an enthusiastic card-player, who, when the victory is almost won, peers at his puzzled antagonist with laughing eyes, and hugs himself with delight, knowing that he holds the cards of all others that is to decide the game, and only waiting for the happy moment when he shall display it, cover his adversaries with confusion, and fill the heart of his partner with joy, and their respective pocket with the golden 'store that glitters so temptingly upon the table between them. Ih the drawing room, Regina paced up and down, with the tress of brown hair clasped be- tween her folded hands upon her breast, "Poor Ruth I poor little Ruth I To think that I, who hoped to make her life so happy should have been the vely one to blight it Do you thinl she knows n w-up in heaven, Clifford?" "I do!" "That wretched man. And yet he bah   seemed so calm and happy all these years! "How could he? It would have driven me mad." "His conscience may be seared on this one point!" said Clifford, thoughtfully. "It is strange! His early errors were not like this. 'He was reckless, and even cruel, in. one sense of the word; but there was no deliberate plan about them.  I do not believe, in my own heart, that he intended harm to Alice, when he sent Howe away." "* Indeed, he did not, sir!" cried Mrs. Main- ing, taking part in the conversation. "He was very kind to me; and we were both so you g; and I was, as Howe said, so giddy, that it wai an easy matter for us to go astray. I could have forgiven him for that, or even for the false marriage, if he had only been true to me. But he left me and my child to starve, and from that day to this has never cared to know if I was alive or dead. That I will never forget-and for that I am here to day to give my evidence against him by repeating my story to her, and the stories of others as deep- ly wronged as I " "Well you have kept your vow!" said Re- gina. "He will never hgave a happy home again-at least, with me I I shall take my boy, and go away from this house to-night; and never again, to the day of my death, will I be called by the nme he has disgraced." Alice gave her a strange look, and seemed about to speak. But she checked herself.' "Are you in earnest, Regina?" said Clifford, in a kind voice. '"Indeed I am '" "Then, as a brother, I offer you a home I Come and live with me and Helen." He held out his hand. She took .t, much moved, held it for a moment. and then, before he could prevent her, raised it to her lips. "Will you come, dear Regina?" "No, Clifford!" 'Why? You cannot fear. me now 1" "No, dear friend I Nor would your Helen. But the world-one must look to that a little. It would never believe that we were only friends."             ' ' What will you do then P" "I have my little cottage, at Brompton, I shall sell that. Then m y own fortune, which I earned honestly.

"Here?" asked Mrs. Maniing, with a flush of pleasure on her dark cheek. "Yes!" ' I will bring him to you!" She passed out into the hall. Howe. stopped er, to ask where she was going, He smiled   when she told him, and listened eagerly to the wheels of a carriage outside. "It has stopped! He is here I Yes, Alice; go for the boy and for your mother I We shall have a family party soon, and family parties are always pleasant. Come down when you hear the bell ring near my door." She glided up the stairs as a thundering knock resounded through the house. Howe entered the drawingrroom; Clifford and Regi- na, pale and agitated, stood together near the window. There was a moment of suspense that seemed almost an age; then the dovtr opened, and the earl, worn and haggard, and anxious looking, rushed in and stood before them. For a moment, not a word was uttered by one of the party. The earl,'glancing at the pale- faces that confronted him, knew that something must have happened. It was pos- sible that Alice might have been there, since' Roberts had been instructed to drive to her house for him. Afraid to ask any questions on this subject-lest he should betray more than they already knew-be contented himself by advancing eagerly toward -Regina, and in quiring if she was ill. She shrank back, and motioned him away.  "Yes, my. lod, I am ill-too ill to bear in. uult and treachery any longer l" "Insult! treachery I What do you mean, Regina?" "Can you ask?" He looked around, aud seeing Howe, who leaned composedly against the mantelpiece, turned pale. "Ah!" he said. Has that fellow been talk- ing to you?" "Yes, my lord!" said Howe, before any one else could speak. "I have been giving her layship a slight sketch of your history, from the time I first had the pleasure of knowing you, up to the present day i"      / "You villain!" "Don't call names, my lord. Unless I am much mistaken, her ladyship would say the term suited you far better than me." "Regina," cried Charlemount, turning tW her in desperation, " what has he been say ing?" "He has told you." "And do you believe him?" "Yes."' "Without hearing me-withouf giving me time to say 6ne word in my own defence? You allow a servant to slander me when I am at- sent, and give credit to any story he may think fit to coin!. Is it just?" Regina looked at him steadily. "My lord, three hours ago I had faith in you-now I have not an atom." "Good Heavens! I would not be so cruel to you, Regipa, for the world."  You have been far, more,cruel to me all these years, though I was ignorant of it till    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6470-00000077"/> now. O Charlemount! what could make you, whom I thought the very soul of truth and honor, stoop to such mean and heartless treachery as this?" In spite of all, the man was true at heart. Even at that last hour, he might have denied Jlouch, and she might possibly have believed him. But be drew a long breath, like one who enakes heavy load from his shoulders, and coming nearer to her, cried out: "I acknowl- edge it all, Regina! I have been a wretch-a villain I know it-but it was because I loved you so." "A strange way you have taken to show that lovel" she said, passionately. "I pass over the fact of your separating ua"--and she waved her hand toward Clifford; "for there, bt least, you have done no mischief. But, oh I the girl that I loved with my whole heart, and that loved me, till you came once more be- tween us-how could you, how could you be so cruel to her? She lived in torments, while 1 was happy with you abroad I She died with your name and mine upon her lips  From first to last, it was your work. But for you the would have been beside me to-day; and through you, she lies in that grave, and all that remains to me of her friendship-is this!" A shiver ran over him, as she held out the tress of hair. *Ruth is in heaven!" he said, in a low voice. "Why do you torment me so?" ' If she is in heaven, it is through no good deed of yours. You did your best to keep her from that happy place." Charlemount stamped his foot impatiently. "Enough of this. Let me hear of what I have been accused?" "I have heard of your early life-of Alice -of many others-and of Ruth!" said Regi- na, succinetly. "This man told you?" "He did." "And what could he say of Alice? She was a pretty little creature, it is true, but by no means as immaculate as he supposes; and-" *Mv lord!" cried Howe, springing forward with flashing eyes-" if you dare to say one word against the girl you ruined, I will kill you." Cbarlemount surveyed him calmly, without stirring from the spot where he stood. I am not afraid of you-but you are a brave fellow, and I like you for standing up f r Alice. after alL Let her go. I will say nothing more of her. But do you tell me how all this has come about I might have expected treachery elsewhere, and been on my guard; but you, who have eaten my bread, and drank of my cup for so many years-how came you to betray me?" "For nearly twenty years I have watched and waited for this day J said Howe, in a tri- umphaut voice.   "Nearly twenty years!"The earl started. "Why, twenty years ago, we were at Erlinford --bys together." "Yes, my lord." "And Alice--"  His brow  grew dark. "*Mal, have you been planning this betrayal ever since she went abroad with me?" Howe smiled, .but did not answer. "I He said that be forgave me!" muttered the earl, with a bewildered look. "And I the lieved him-I trusted him-and now he has turned traitor " "Is it so wonderful?" asked Howe, with a sneer. "You have betrayed those who never wronged you I only fought against my ene- my!" The eall's head drooped upon his breast. He felt that the man's reproach was true, and he dared not look at Regina, who stood haughtily aloof, without appearing to notice anything that was going on. "And where is Alice now?" he asked, at last, in a subdued tone. "You will set her soon She is under this very roof l"  , "Here?" Yes.  The letter was but a feint to secure your absence. She has been here all the even- ing I Her ladyship has been talking to her 1" The earl looked at him darkly. "And the boy?" "George Erlinford is here also!" "How dare he call himself by that name?" "His mother has a peculiar love for it," said Howe, with a sneer "What more is there to come?" sked the earl, sternly. "Something exceedingly pleas- ant, my lord I I have kept it as a bonne- boltche to the last." "Listen, sir " said Charlemount, grasping him by the collar. "I have borne with yoa all this time, but I warn you not to trifle too far with a desperate man I Say what you like, produce what witnesses you like. but play the game out quickly, if you have anr regard for yourself, and remember to treat me with re- spect while I am your master. Do you hear?" "It will not be for long," muttered Howe.' '*If it is for five minutes only, I will he obeyed!" thundered the earl. "Now leave this room, and when you enter it again, do so as a servant, and not as the equal 4 f those you find here, or I will throw you out of the window as soon as you cross the threshold." Howe retreated without a word. Regina took no notice of the slight affray, but Clif-. ford came up to the earl, and held out his hand. ;. My lord, it has been very painful for me )o remain through all these disclosures. I did so by the special request of Howe, who pro- fesses to have something to say which nearly concerns me." "He has made me out a fine fellow, no doubt," said Charlemouut, looking toward Re-   gina. "I wonder you have the courage to seak to me-or the will-after all thatyou have heard." "I have forgiven and forgotten my own share of the pain long ago, Charlemount; and when I think of the stake for which you play- ed, I can find it in my heart to excuse you for the desperate game." 4T Thank you-thank you i It is something to hear one kind word when a man is cornered up as I am! Upon my word, my sins seem to find me out. There comes my son and heir, 1 suppose; and who on earth besides?" CHAPTER XV., "Thine eyes are closed. . But I look out Through tears upon my fellow-men; And stepping o'er thylonely grave, Come ' back to busy life again!' For thee, the silence of the tomb- The silence none may dare to break , For me, the deep, perpetual gloom- The soul in mourning, for thy sake!" --M. B. The door opened, as Charlemount spoke, and George Erlinford entered, with his mother leaning on his arm. After them came Howe, eupporting the, steps of an old woman, who peered anxiously up into Charlmount's face, as she stood before him. "No, it's not my boy!" she cried. "You said I should see my boy, Alice!" "And so you shall, mother!" said Mrs. Main- ing, as she closed the door upon one or two powdered menials whose curiosity had been aroused to such an extent by the extraordinary proceedings of the last two hours, that they were loitering in the hall, in hopes of seeing or hearing something that would explain the mystery.  "My boy!" my boy 1" muttered the old wo- nan, peevishly. "If he' is not here, I'll go i 0ack again, and have another glass of wine 1" From the moment of her entrance, Clifford had stood like one in a dream-his color com- ing and going so fast, that Regina watched him anxiously lest he should fall. Now, he stepped forward into the full light of the room, and B aid: "Does she mean me, Howe? It seems as if I ought to know that voice 1" "t's him Hit's my Francie!" cried the old nurse, as her eyes fell upon him ; and, the rext moment, she was sobbing wildly upon his breast. "' My boy!-my pretty boy I I always knew I should see you again Have yr u forgotten your poor old nurse, Francie darling 9? "No, no I I remember you!" said Clifford, kissing the withered cheek. "But where? When I look at you, and hear you speak, I seem to recall another land-another home. It was not in England. Where could it have been? Sit here, and tell me. I have so often longed to know!" She let him place her in an easy-chair, and   smoothed the bright curls away from his fore- head, as he knelt beside her. "You have got your poor mother's face, Francie I Ialways said so." "My mother!" cried Clifford, with a trem- bling voice. "My mother I Where is she?" "In her grave, Francie-in .her grave  These old hands laid her in the coffin And she died in my armst  Margery,' she said, 'they will wrong my boy!

And I have got him back again at last!" She was so absorbed in the delight of caress- ing her long lost nursling, that it was useless to question her more closely. Clifferd looked up at Howe. "Do you really know what she means?" " do, sir." "Tell me, then." Lord Charlemount was pacing up and down the room with his hands clasped behind him; Alice and her son stood near the door; and Regina, beside the window, looked at the differ- ent groups with an absorbing interest. Here, in her quiet English home, was a scene far more exciting than any she had ever depicted upon the-stage. "I have already told you," said Howe, ad- dressing Clifford, but watching the earl, " that Lord Erlinford resided for a long time abroad,  and that his second son was born in Italy." "I know." ' People said that Lady Erlinford died of a broken heart. That I do not doubt. But they also said that her eldest son's misconduct was the cause of that mishap. Your old nurse can tell you better." "He never loved her!" cried thlold wdman, who remembered the events of her youth far, better than those of her later years. "They were cousins-both Erlinfords-and he married her that one of the family estates might not go away from him. After they went abroad, he neglected her shockingly, and we scarcely saw his face from one week-to another. He was a bad man, and if it had not been for him, my lady might have been living now." "It runs in'the family-this ill-treatment of wives l'aaid Howe, in a low voice. The earl, glanced toward him; -but, luckily, he had not been able to distinguish the words. "Bear in mind what I told you a few mo- ments ago l" he said, significantly, as he re- sumed his march. "Well, Howe?" said Clifford, too impatient to tolerate an interruption, no mNtter in what form or frorn what source it came. "Lady Erlinford died; but the -son was a healthy child, and bade fair to lay claim to the    <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6470-00000078"/> barony, if his elder brother died before his majority. Lord Erlinford hated the infant as he had hated his mother before its birth. But there was another child that he loved." 4"Whose?" demanded Charlemount, stopping suddenly before him. s Giula Monti's, my lord.". Is Good I She was my nurse. We are get- ting into difficulties, I see. Do you mean to aLy that her child was also my father's?" "[ do" * She was his mistress, then?" "Not txactly-that is, she was not at the last." What do you mean?" "There was a marriage the very day after Lady Erlinford's death." "Before a Protestant clergyman?" "No. A priest-heruncle-married them." "But the child?" "Their marriage could not legitimize him, my lord. He was born a month before the second son of Lady Erlinford." "Still, she was his wife at the last "' "Yes, my lord." Charlemount looked thoughtfully at Clifford. * He has the Erlinford face! That woman says that his mother died in her arms; yet she was with Lady Erlinford, abroad. Whose son is he?" "The son of Lord and Lady Erlinford, to be sure!" cried the old nurse. * My own boy that I nursed, and that I shall see righted, at last!" Charlemount caught his breath. I, then, am supposed to be Guila Monti's son! Mr. Clifford, what do You know of this affair?" "I, my lord?" "Yes, you  Since you are the party most interested in the making and proving such a charge, it is only proper to ask you about it t" "I give you my. word, my lord, that till this moment, I never heard or thought of such a thing," said Clifford, rising, and coming up to him. "t It is a weak afid foolish lie, got up by that man!" said 'Cfiarlemount, excitedly. "It car- ries falsetood on its very face! What man, in his senses, would disinherit his lawful son foi' an unlawful one?" "' Alice, the papers!" said Howe. Charlemount started violently, and went up to Mrs. Maining. '; Are you Alice?" ". Yep, my lord," was the old t ply. "Changed like this 1" "I have had much to chang mne, my lord 1" He looked at her, and at the boy who stood defiantly before him, and sighed. "What apess have yoti? ' he aked, weari- ly. ' Get through this business soon, or, upon my word, I shall go mad!"  ** Baptismal register of Frieanos Clifford Er- linford; baptismal register of George. Monti   Erlinford; marriage papers of Geotge Grant Erlinford and Giula Monti; and testimony of Margery Manners, who hassbeen confined in an Italian cohvent till the last year, under pre. telce of madness!" said Howe, placing them, one after another, upon the table. "They are only copies; but the originals are in the hands of a lawyer, and can be produced at once, if needed"  "' Slut up in an Italianconvent!" said Char. lenount. contemptuously. * Who will believe it? These are hot the days for such things, my good fellow.'  "My lord," said Alice, she could not speak a word of Italian, and the good nuns knew so English. Your father told them she was mad; and when they saw how violent she became, they believed it. .They were very kind to her; and when an English'lady visiting them, dur. ing the last year, happened to hear her story, they liberated her at once, and the lady sent for me. I have their statement of the matter, and hers, if you would like to see them." He looked at her with a melancholy smile, as he replied: "No, thank you, Alice, I do not care to see them. Let the coronet go I After all, it is b t a small loss compared to some others!". And his eyes turned toward his wife, who still stood like a. statue by the window, speaking to no one, but watching every one. He went and stood near her, and folding his arms upon the mantelpiece, leaned his head down upon them, and looked moodily into the grate. If this calamity had overtaken him be- fore'Relina had learned his treachery, no one would have been more fond and faithful than she; but she said inwardly, as she gazed upon the lock of hair she held: "It is the judgment of God, and he merited it! He may bear it alone!" Clifford and Howe examined the papers si- lently. The young man lifted up his head, at last, with a smile of triumph. "There is no doubt-" he began; and then his eyes fell upon the bowed figure of Charle- mount, and he crossed the roond, and laid his hand upon his shoulder. "I Come what may, George, we are brothers!" he said, in a low voice. The earl raised his head." "Yes, Francis-nothing can blot that out!" And he stood looking into the fair, resolute face, with a mixture of pleasure and pain so oddly blended, tlhat he could scarcely tell fh eh feeling predominated. "You will make a bet- ter Earl of Oharlemount than I?" George, I can't take the title frot you- and 1 won't 1" faltered Clifford, whose eyed now- Were full of tears. "P Psha I Can you make out a clear dase from yonder papers?"

"He has only to be iden- tified by two persons-the master of the York- shire school, where he was brought up, and the sea-captaio who took him here." Are they alive?" "Yes, my lord." "' And in London." "hey will be soon, my lord." "Then farewell to my coronet!" said Charle- mount, smiling, "And may you. enjoy it, Clifford, more than I have done!" "George,'we can settle this matter in an- other way. You are. the elder. Keep the title, but acknowledge me as your younger brother-I shall be content with that." "You forget that I have a son. Even at my death the title would not come to you." "Never mind. I do not waat it!" "By Heaven, Francis, you are a noble fel- low I No, we will have no such transfers. I only spoke to try you. You will -be Earl of Charlemount. Allow me to be the first to con- gratulate you, my lord!" "Don't, George! I can't bear it from you." "It is nothing. You need not grieve for me. I am ruined and disgraced, it is true; but what of that? Ruined and disgraced! The words have an ugly sound. But there! don't shed a tear for me, Francis; I'm not worth it! Come here, George Erlinford." The boy started, and looked doubtfully at him. "I mean you. Come to me." The boy went. Charlemount looked at him earnestly. They were like in features and in form, and he smiled sadly as he saw it. "My boy, you and I stand on the same level just now. You are as much y'ur father's son as I was. But 1 loved my father, and you hate yours!" "No," said the boy, without looking up. "I hated yoi an hour ago, when I thought you were the earl, and too proud to own me; but I would love you now if you would let me." "Let you? I should be grateful if a stray dog wagged 'his tail out of sympathy for me. 1 have not so much love lavished upon me just at this moment, that I can afford to slight yours, Georgy!" He held out his hand-the lad seized it, pressed it to his lips and to his heart, and sobbed aloud; "Father, I will work for you-I will help you, and so will mother!"'he dried. "Wrong there, my child l" said the earl, gently. "Your mother is a woman, and women do not always forgive, do they, Alice?" "Not always, my lord i" Still keeping the boy near him, Charlemount turned to Regina.

"Well, I am the last person on earth to de- termine your movements. And as the final arrow has sped from your quiver, perhaps you will have the goodness to withdraw. I wish to speak to her ladyship privately, if she will al- low me." They, were obeying, but Regina came for ward, and requested them to stop. "I have nothing to say to the Earl of Char- lemount in private," she said, coldly. "Sine you have stayed so long. you may as well see th play played out. Now, my lord, I will hear you!" "You choose a mixed audience, Regina!" "What does it matter? What do you wish to say?" "1 cannot tell you here-and thus!" "Then I shall never hear it! After I leave this room, you will have no more opportunities of speaking to me, either in public or in pri- vate!" "What do you mean?" "I shall leave the house at once l" "And me?" "And you, my lord!" "But the boy?"  - "Will go with me!" "May'l ask where?" "You may.  I shall ask Mr.. Erlinford- Helen's mother -to shelter me for a time, till I can make preparations for leaving Eng- land!" *Forever?" "Forever!" Charlemount looked long at her. Never had he loved her more tenderly than now; but she stood haughtily before him, giving no sign of emotion or of sympathy with his hard fate. "Was it the coronet you married?" he ask- ed, suddenly. She turned crimson. "Why do you ask such a question?'" "Answer it!"  "It was the coronet I married! But," she added, with a slight tremor in -her voice, "* it was the man I learned to love afterward; and if he had been a beggar, I should have loved him still, provided he had kept his honor and his truth unsullied." The earl turned away with an impatient groan. ", Francis, you see it is all over between us. There is no question of your marriage now I Will you see that she has a pleasant home with-with Helen?" "I will!" "And little Stuart-if I never see tis face again, will you teach him to hate his father, Regina?" His voice faltered, and he put his hand up to    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6470-00000079"/> his eyes, to hide the tears that fell hot and fast at the thought of the separation, so much worse to him than death. "Don't cry, father!" said George Erlinford, clinging to his arm. "I will go with you, if she will not." "No, George; your place is with your mother. It matters little what becomes of me -but, Francis, you will see that al are pro- vided for?"  "Trust me " said Clifford, wringing his band ' But I hope all these'wounds may yet be healed. Regina, it is but a fewhouis since you told me how dear my brother was to you, lsas the love gone so soon?" She did not answer. After one startled glance at Charlemount weeping, and the son of Alice consoling him, she bent her eyes obsti- nately on the ground. "f, by any unforseen providence, George should be taken from you, you would regret most bitterly that you were so cold and cruel to him in his hour of trouble." "We forgive the dead all things! Of the dead we speak nothing but good!" was her re- ply, and a deep flush covered Charlemount's face as he heard it. "But the living must atone for their faults before they can be for- given!" "Show me how to do it!' cried Charle- mount. ." Tell me what to do-give me the hardest task on earth, and I will accomplish it gladly. Only, do not kill me with this dreadful coldness P" "I have only one task to give you. No doubt you will find it a difficult one." "Name it!" "Be true!" He turned white, and leaned heavily against the mantelpiece. "Regina, how merciless you are 1" "No-I am only just" After all these happy years, must we two part like this I Can nothing move you?" "Not the memory of those years. You had better not invoke it. Cannot you see that be- cause they were to happy, I abhor them now? Their foundation was a terrible one-Ruth's grave 1" "Well, I'stand at bay, with my foes on every side of me 1" said Charlemount. "Only Fran- cis and this poor child to feel 'for me And yet I have wronged them, as well as you and Alice. How ir it that you two are so proud? You are women-you should have gentle hearts, if all that is said of your sex be true!" "My lord, you will find, before you die, that women are not all spaniels by nature and education. There are some among us who cannot overlook falsehood, when it meets them in a form like this! Women are human as well as men! Why should they always suffer in silence? If I had deceived you as you have deceived me, when would my pardon be spoken?"   "At once, Regina!" ' Never!" she answered, with a slight smile. "I should be driven at once from your pres ence, and disgraced in the eyes of all who know me. I have feelings and passions as well as you! Why should I turn meekly round, and offer my cheek to you for a second blow?" "Is that your final answer, R gina?" "It is!" "Remember our boy!"   .    -  "Because I remember him, I say it. He, at least, must grow up frank and true." "And in order that he may do so, you re- move him from my care?" She did not answer. "Regina," said Clifford, " you are too cruel! Do you not see how you are paining him?" "I can but speak the truth," was her stern reply. "You leave me, then, in my poverty and loneliness! You leave me without a home, without a wife, without a child, without a name!"  "I leave you because you have been weighed in the balance, and are found wanting! Be- cause I cannot love if I cannot trust-and I trust you no longer!" "We are liable to err," said Clifford. "My brother will never deceive you again, Regina Be more forgiving! If God treated us as we treat each other, what would become of us?" "What do you wish?" she cried, angrily. "My lord, if you persist in claiming me, I will remain. I will be faithful to you-I will study your comfort in every way. But if you ask me for love, I have it not to. give you ; if you wish for confidence, you will be disappointed. Choose for yourself, and tell me if I am to go or stay!" "Y'ou must not stay with me, if those are your terms, Regina-I could not bear it. But when I am dead, you will remember me more kindly. I shall not forget what you said about the dead!" He held out his hand to Clifford. "All that remains for me now is, like Ceesar. to 'cover my face, and die with dignity.' Farewell, brother! Be kind to this poor boy, who has shown me kindness in my hour of greatest need." "George, where are you going?" He only smiled-wrung his brother's 'hand -kissed George Erlinford upon the forehead, and turning to Regina, caught her in his arms before she could move away. For one briet moment he held her to his heart, and covered her eyes, her lips, and her hands with kisses. "Forgive me, love " he whispered. And when she looked up, he had gone. There was a terrible silence, which no one cared to breiak. Long after those hasty foot- steps iad ceased to ring in the hall, they stood and listened. A new sound struck them dumb   with horror. A shot pealed, clear and sharp, 1 through every room in the house.  ," Good Heaven the pistols!" cried Howe, flinging open the door, and rushing up the  stairs to his master's private study. The little child stood trembling and crying at the door. "O Howe! ,Howe! Papa came and kissed me, and ran away; and now he won't let me come in!" Regina, reaching the landing-place, caught the boy up, and thrust him into his nurse's arms. , Take him away! If you let him enter that room, or tell him what has happened, I will never forgive you! Burst the door, men! Great Heaven! be quick!" The bolt yielded, and she rushed in, followed by Clifford, Alice, Howe, George Erlinford, and the servants. She flung herself down, with a passionate cry, beside the figure, lying still upon the floor. I George! George I speak to me! You cannot die without forgiving me!" As if her voice had power even to call the spirit back, his eyes unclosed. Quick!" cried Clifford to a servant. 't Ride for a d6ctor! And here, George, help me to move him to this couch." as they placed him upon the soft cushions, he looked up in Regina's face and smiled. "You can forgive the dead, Regina--you will soon forgive me!" She flung her arms around him, and buried her face in his bosom. The lock of Ruth's hair, still clutched within her hand, was dyed with his life-blood, and became a terrible relic for after-days. "You do forgive me, darling 1" he whispered, faintly. "Oh, I have nothing to forgive-nothing! And I have killed you! Clifford, send for a a clergyman, before it is too late!" "It is too late already, Regina - he is sink- ing fast i" "Yes-it is all over " murmured the dying man. "Alice and Howe might even forgive me nowP' Howe stood for a moment, dark and stern, looking down upon him. His features work d convulsively-a dreadful sob burst from his 'ips-and flinging himself down upon his knees, cried out: "O Master George I Master George!" It was the old familiar name he had used in their childhood, and the Earl's dull eye kin- died when'he heard it. "Good-bye'!" he whispered. "We shall go for no more bird's-nests in Erlinford woords. And Alice?"A Alice was there, with her lips upon his cold hand. "They have all forgiven the!" he murmured. "Will not God forgive me also? I was mad f -- scarcely knew what I did! Through the              t     ..   heart, Regina-the heart that loved you so!' Oh, I suffer! It is hard to die!-and after death--. Pray for me, love - pray, all of you!" They knelt beside him, and Clifford - his voice choked with sobs-interceded for their dear one with his offended God. The earl lay' quietly with Regina's arms around him, and hii head resting on her breast. Suddenly, a strong convulsion ran through every limb--he lifted his head eagerly: "God be merciful to-" The words died upon his lips- e gave. a long sigh, and looked at Regina. With th,-, prayer of the poor publican for his passport, he had gone out into the other world which presses so closely upon ours, and yet remains forever mysterious, and forever unknown. Clifford closed the eyes, that, even in death, were turned upon the face they had loved so well. "Come, Regina!' he said, gently; "we can do nothing more for him now!" "Nothing!" She looked a moment at the peaceful face of the corpse, and sank back in his arms, almost as cold and pale. They carried her away with the tenderest care, and laid her down beside her little child; and the new earl began to reign in the dead earl's home I It was long before Regina recovered her health and spirits, after this terrible shock-so long, that preparations-for the marriage of Clifford and Helen were going busily forward when she rose at last from her sick-bed. Howe and Alice had started for the Continent direct. ly after their own wedding; and the boy, George Erlinford, was with them; while Clif- ford's old nurse was made rich and happy by the gift of th&amp; lodge at the gates of Erlinford Park, where she had spent her early days. A great commotion in the London world attended the accession of the new earl to the title, but no one was found to dispute it; and settlements were made, and jewels chosen, with the great- est possible dispatch; while the young ladies all wondered "what Lord Charlemount could see in her," and the old ones said "it was all her scheming mother's work." Helen herself was silent, and intensely happy-bear- ing her mother's eiultant joy and her father's loudly-expressed satisfaction with the same placid mien. Only one thought disturbed hei happiness, and that was of Regina. Was it possible that she wioihad once loved Clifford so, could be anything but miserable at seeing him about to wed another? The thought took to itself wings, when Regina herself, pale and lovely in her widow's weeds, came to congrat- ulate her. "I am glad that you are to marry him," she said, frankly; " and that you are to live in my 1 home. I could not bear that another should be there."  "But you, Regina?" whispered Helen, with    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6470-00000080"/> her blushing face buried in her hands. What will you do?"  * I have my boy, and Prudence, and Prince Charlie, and my Texan home. Don't fear for me, love!" was the grave reply So it happened that it was Regina's hand that placed the bridal veil upon the beautiful fair head, and Regina's voice that first said, "Countess of Charlemount," as she kisseed the blushing bride, and gave her hand to Clifford, when the ceremony was over. And Helen was content. The feast was over, the farewells said, and the guests had gone away. The bride and groom were speeding on their wedding tour- and Regina, having made her last adieu to them, drove back, to say good-bye to home, and to all the wealth an- splendor lavished there. The little boy had already gone, in charge of his nurse, to Southampton; the servants were to remain tilt the return of the new earl; and nothing, except her own personal property, had been removed from the house. In those beautiful saloons Helen would receive her titled guests. In that noble dining-room, Clif- ford would sit over his wine with his friends. Helen's head would press the pillows of that sumptuous couch which poor Charlemount had designed for his bride. Only one room would remain empty and unused-the little study on the third floor, where that awful tra- gedy had been enacted. Poor George I Oh I where, where was he now? Was there a hope that in the next world they might meet, who had been so terribly separated here? She dared not dwell upon the thought. She gave one glance around the stately apartments, and descending the staircase for the last time - ah I what bitter words those are, wherever or how- ever they may be used!-took leave of the servants, who waited in the hall. oTo do them justice, they crowded round her as eagerly and as respectfully as if she had been Countess of Charlemount still; and more thanone sob tes- tified to their sorrow at parting with the gen- tle mistress from whom they had all received so much consideration and kindness. Thomas, the footman, had tears in her eyes as he hand- ed her to the plain little brougham, where Prudence was already waiting. and said: "God bless your ladyship!"She thanked him sad- 'y; she leaned back in her carriage, and wav- ng a last good-bye to them all, put her hand- kerchief to her eyes. They drove away; and of that splendid home nothing remained to Regina but a memory and a dream. That evening, they reached Wilverton. The moon was shining brightly, when Regina went down the little garden-path of the cottage, while Prudence waited at the gate. The house was empty, the shutters up, and fastened, A wild rose had fallen from its trellis over the porch, and lay across the door, barring the entrance with a c hain of perfumed blossoms. The grounds, untouched since Ruth's death,   were overgrown with weeds and neglected fowers. A few sheep, that grazed in the mead. owe during the day, were lying beneath the garden-fence; they lifted their heads, but did not rise as sae came near; and by a bed of purple violets - American violets, such as grew in the garden of their Brompton home  she saw * narrow mound, over which the long grass fwaved sadly in the night-wlid. She fell upon her knees beside it; she clasped her arms over it, and put her face down to the ground, as if she would embrace the sleeper who was lying so quietly there. Only one word was cut upon the head-stone-- Ruth.' She looked at it steadily for a moment. s',t)ec out that beloved name, and then all wa4 still. As the church- lock tolled eleven, Prudence saw her coming toward the gate, looking very pale, and holding a cluster of violets in her- hand. She gave a few to the old nurse, and put the others carefthy away. "We will keep them fcr-for her sake!" she said, with a quiver in her voice, as she gave a last look toward the grave. "And now for Southampton!" At one o'clock, they reached'their place of destination; and going to bed, slept, let us hope, quite soundly, till the waiter, going through the hotel the next morning, to awaken the passengers for America, called out at the door that the " steamer left at nine." The lit- tle boy, pleased with his journey, and with the new faces he had seen, came prattling in with his nurse to share his mother's breakfast. "Oh, mother, I have been so good!" he cried out when he saw her. "'I have not cried once-have I, nurse?" ' That's my brave boy!" said Regina, taking him in her arms, and giving him- a long, fond kiss,  "How like he was to him who had gone! She had never noticed it so much before; but now, the smile-the features-the waving hair the upright carriage-a thousand little ways and 'looks-recalled the father so vividly to her heart, that she could scarcely bear the pain of memory. The little steamer sailed punctually at nine o'clock; and Stuart, delighted with the bustle. ran gayly up and down the deck, playing witf the children, as they glided oVer the beautiful Southampton Water. Prudence and the nurse overlooked his movements with jealous and careful eyes ; but Regina sat apart, and bend- ing over the boat's 'ide, looked into the crest ed .aves, and thought, half sadly, half ten- derly, of all the events of her checkered life in tile land she was leaving for ever. Suddenly, the child ran up, and pulled her by the skirts "Oh, lookx motert there is a town before us, and a great ship, and such a pretty flag!" She looked up. The American steamer waU lying off Cowes--the American flag as flying in the air. An Wdd thrill ran over her from    head to foot; she sprang to her feet, and look- ed at the banner with tearful eyes. ", What flag is it, all covered over with stars?' the child kept crying. And she answered: "My dear, it is the flag of home!" Yes-she felt it at the moment I Her best, her safest, and her dearest refuge was in that lonely Southern villa which she had once aban- doned. There lay her country-there lay the future of her child! And in her heart she said a little prayer of thankfulness to Him who had granted her so quiet a haven, in which to furl the sales of her tempest-tossed bark, and tempt the sea no more    / 1 At twelve o'clock, all was ready. Friends said their last good-bye, and hurried down the vessel's side; the sailors ran to and fro, and the captain, at the gangway, uttered his orders more quickly and more sharply than before. A bell rang-a gun fired-a great cheer rang from deck to shore-and they were off and away, gliding down the Channel, with the starry flag lowered now and then in momentary salute, as they passed the English ships. The Channel was all alive with vessels, and now and then a cheer saluted them as they passed-a "good-b e" from strangers to strangers, which seems to me one of the most touching things on earth. The decks were crowded. Regina stood aft, with her arm around her boy. "Look, mother-look at the pretty rocks!" he cried, as they passed the Needles. "Yes, Stuart." She. lifted: him in her arms, and leanedi-er cheek upon his golden head. It grew dark. One after another, the passengers stole away, and lights began to twinkle on the now distant shore. 'Farewell to Old England!" said Regina, aloud, waving her hand toward the coast. The cLild looked up in her face. * Why do you say that, mother? And why do you look sosorry? Farewdll to Old Eng- land!' he added, waving his tiny hand in imi- tation of her. "When shall we see Old Eng- lanil again, mother?     ' "When, indeed?" said Regina, sadly, And. a sob broke from the lips of a poor young wife by her side at the artless question. She had left father, and mother, and home, for a stran- ger. When should she see father, and mother, and home again? The years passed quietly and happily on in the Texan villa, and the life which had been so stormy in its commencement was drawing to a peaceful close. Prudence, after a long and faithtul service, had left her dear mistress-her grave was green within the ohapparal besile Regina's home. Prince Charlie,'too, was bur- ied by a fountain in the garden, and iothing remained to speak of the past except the boy. Over him Regina watched with anxious eyes. To save him from his father's vices was her ^     's    continual care. He was educated at home-he was continually under her influence -and, what was better than all, he was sincerely reli- gious. A purer soul then his scarce ever dwelt in a more beautiful frame, Fair-haired and blue-eyed, like the race whose name he bore, he had' received from his mother that charming smile -that ndive frankness of air and manner-that grace of movement and ex, pression, which made her still one of the most beautiful and winning of women. It was im- possible to look upon these two, so rarely gift- ed and so entirely alone, without a peculiar feeling of interest; and now and then, an ar- dent Texan hunter or a courteous Southern planter, would intimate a desire of sharing that. solitude and relieving that loneliness. To each and all Regina gave the same answer. "You pay me a great compliment; but I have no heart to give, no love .to bestow, ex- cept upon my boy. I have done with the world, and he has not begun with it; but we are sufficient to each other at present, and hap- piest when alone." But such a life, though very happy, was not to last for ever. There were ' rumors of wars", around them. At last the thunderbolt came, and the short but terrible struggle between Mexico and the United States commenced. Stuart Erlinford, who had been. bred up in a half-military fashion, was eager to join the fray. "You told. me long ago, mother, that the American flag was the flag of home," he cried. Let me go and help, to make it so!" Foolish fellow I , You are only a child!" "I am seventeen years old, mother, and as tall and strong as most men are at twenty-five. I can hold a sword-I will enlist as a common soldier!" "Very well, you shall go!" was Regina's calm reply. "-You will fight under a brave general; but mind, my boy, you must work your way up from the ranks! I shall put- chase no commission for you!" He understood her in a moment, and kissed her fondly. "Dear mother, I will show you and the whole world that I am worthy to be your son. Only let me take my sword from your hand-- that is all I ask." And in this fashion he joined the brave band of volunteers who rallied at thair country's cau, and went to shed their blood t n its battle-fields. Perhaps the' quarrel was unjust; but it is over now, and the grass is, grown greenfy over the graves of those who felL. Let the dead rest in peace  Stuart ErlinfoOl thought little about its cause-his adopted country called for-help, and he answered with all his heart.  He marched oa foot in the brave Colonel Maylyn's regiment; and by his side were men of good birth and gentle breeding. whowere willing also to serve n this humble manner rather    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6470-00000081"/> than not serve at all. Throughout the war that regiment was distinguished for its deeds of daring. Wherever the sword of its gallant leader flashed, the Mexicans fell by hundreds, as his soldiers rallied around him. Stuart loved and idolized him, and wrote long letters to Regina about his valor 'and his gentleness. A pencil sketch of him at the head of his troops, his plumed hat off, and his long locks waving in the wind, hung on the walls of her study - drawn by Staart's hand. How her heart followed the boy through that sad cam- paign-how she trembled after every battle, lest his name should be returned in that dread- ful list of "killed l" But he was spared. And when they won the heights of Monterey, it was his hand that planted the starry flag he loved so well upon the city walls I The general him- self-"- Old Rough and Ready," as his army fonidlv nicknamed him-saw the gallant act; and when the war was over, Captain Erlinford returned to his proud and happy mother, cov- ered with glory, and having brought away but one small souvenir of the strife, in the shape of a scar upon his left temple, which made her tremble and turn pale, when her eyes first fell upon it. In the midst of all the joy of his return, the young captain could not help seeing that a worn and uneasy look had come upon his mother's face. 'Some presentiment of a coming change seemed hanging over her. She was onstantly making arrangements for his future, as if she was not to share. it. It puzzled him - it saddened him - and yet he dared not speak-he would not give utterance to a haunt- ing fear that came now anil then, and touched his heart, and seemed to say: 1"By-and-by you will know me well, and I shall be ever with you." Regina was the first to break the silence be- tween them. As they sat one evening in the little parlor, she called him to her side, and looked fondly into his face. '"Stuart, I have something to ask you." "Well, mother?"  "Last evening, as you slept, I went into your room. I often do that when I lie awake and lonely." "Dear mother!" "I sat down by your bed, thinking'of'many things. You were Wptless-- you turned and ,tossed upon your ipow-at last you uttered a name." "A name!" The young man's face was crimson. "Yes. Shall I tell you more?  It was a woman's name-the sweetest name, some think, that ever woman bore!" *"It was Mary!" he said, in a low voice. "( Yes." He leaned against her knee, and looked up at her with a blush and a smile.   "Dear mother,' I have often wished to speak to you of her." "( Who is she, Stuart?" "The sister of my dear friend Maylyn." "Where did you meet her?" ", She followed him through the war, moth. er. He was her twin-brother, and their pa. rents are dead." "And now?" "After he died, she returned to her home in Virginia." "And this is the secret 'of your long walks -of your longer reveries -you foolish, boy Tell me, did she care for you!" t"H thought so at times, dear mother; but I never spoke." "rIs she good, Stuart?" "As an angel?" "Ah! but I mean, is she religious?" "Yes. She and Maylyn were both devot- ed members of the Church of England!" "That is well!" said Regina, with a long sigh. ,Do you love her well enough, Stu. art, to spend your life with her?" "Do I? O mother!" She laughed, and tapped the cheek that flushed so red with her slender hand. "Listen, my dear boy I You must go to Virginia at once. You must ask your Mary to come back with you.' I think she will. Indeed, there are few Marys in the world who would not be glad to share your home, my boy!" "Ah, mother, she is so beautiful, and so much admired I There was not an officer in the whole army who would not have given worlds to win a smile from her. The gener- al himself admired her-you don't know how much!"  "I know that my boy is an Erlinford- and like -like his father," said Regina, in a low voice. "And being this, I think a young and beautiful girl might well love 'him, un- less her heart was already engaged." "I do not, think that."  "Go and see." "When, dear mother?" "Soon-soon!" she cried, with feverish en- ergy, laying her hand upon her hear. "Look, Stuart I I have set my heart upon seeing youen with a dear young wife. Life is so uncertain -if I should be called away-" "Oh, mama mia! we will not speak of that," he said, kissing her tenderly. She looked at him a moment, as if she were about to say something, but checked herself. "When you come back, Stuart, we must have a long conversation. But now I can only think of your Mary! You will need no intro- ductioli of mine; your own gallantry is the hest letter of recommendation you can have. Has she any very near relatives?" "None, mother; she lives with a cousin." "Is she an heiress?"   "No; she is poor." "So. much the better. You will have no family to annoy you; and you may say to her that all your mother, has is yours from this day, and that that mother waits anxiously to welcome her to her heart and home l., ow, when will you go?" "To-morrow, if, you like," he said, with a playful smile. "To-morrow, let it be," she answered, with a perfect gravity.   '        ' And on the next tvesiog Regina sat' alone in the little parlor, and Stuart had " gone a woo. ing" to the north. It seemed but a few days to her siuoe he had been lying in her arms, a, little helpless child I   ,* *  * * His wooing sped as might well have been: imagined, and in a little more than three weeks he was driving over the sandy road that led" from the station to the villa, with a dark-haired and beautiful brunette seated by 'his side.: Regina, having been apprized by letter of their arrival, had sent her carriage to meet them. The servant said 'his mistress w',uld have come. herself, but she was "not very well;" and Stuart, always anxious about his worshiped: mother, worked himself up to a fearful pitch of nervousness before they stopped at the vine- covered door at their home. No one was on' the porch to welcome them. He ran eagerly: into his mother's room. She was lying baC' upon the cushions of her chair, pale, and almost I ftifiting. '"What is this?-oh, what is this?" he rried, as he flung himself'on his knees before her. "Mother, why did you send me from you?" Water, my son!" ehe said, faintly ; and he caught a glass from the little table beside heir chair, and held it to her lips. The wan look passed slowly frotm her face, and'the color came to her lips again. "Have you been ill, mother, and' ho long?" "For years," she said, with a sweet smile.! "We will not talk of it just yet. Is she with you-your Mary?" He sprang up, and brought his young bride proudly to his mother's chair. "-This is my Mary!" '  Regina took the trembling little hands in her. own, looked a 'moment at the glittering wed- ding-ring, then into the face of the girl who wore it. A pensive sadness touched its bril- liant beauty with an added charm, and: Some thing in the soft, bright eyes reminded her of Ruth. She kissed'her very fonidly. . "M dear child, welcome honme!
