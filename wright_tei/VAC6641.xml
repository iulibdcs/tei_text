            <head>PREFACE.</head> 
            <p>It has become so customary and "<emph>fashionable</emph>" at the present age of book making to introduce all new works with a preface, that were I not now to follow the example! I would be thought eccentric, or ignorant of the established custom.</p> 
            <p>I will therefore ask of the reader of this small work a careful and impartial perusal, as the object of its publication is to awaken an inquiry in the minds of the people as to the subject upon which it treats.</p> 
            <p>I would also say to those who are opposed to reading Novels, that this work, although written after the fashion and manner of fictitious works, is not in reality a Novel. Every incident spoken of in this work is true, and actually occurred, but the names of places and persons, and also the classification of events are gratuitous upon the part of the Author.</p> 
            <p>If this work should be instrumental, in any way, in causing the Authorities and Legislators of our country to adopt more mild and disciplinarian punishment for the correction of youthful offenders, the object and molt sanguine expectations of the author will be obtained.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
               <p>The sun had disappeared behind the western horizon, and the night was growing extremely dark.</p> 
               <p>It was in the month of November, and the city of St. Louis was crowded with merchants from the interior and upper part of the country, who had come to the great western Emporium for the purpose of laying in a winter supply of goods. The daily newspapers of the city were teeming with accounts of thefts, robberies, and daring deeds of burglary, most of which were committed upon strangers who were in the city on business, The police were continually on the alert, but could make no great inroads into the ranks of the cunning and ingenious depredators.</p> 
               <p>The night on which our tale opens was an uncommonly dark one, A and offered great facilities to the pick-pockets and highwaymen.-They lost no time in profiting by their advantages, as will be seen in the course of our narrative. About ten o'clock in the night a voice was heard in one of the main streets of the city, and immediately a stifled groan and the weight of a man's body falling heavily upon the pavement were heard by the night watch as he was pacing his round on the other corner of the street. Hastening to the spot from whence the noise proceeded, he soon discovered the body of a man laying prostrate upon the pavement, and looking around as if to satisfy himself that the ruffian who had committed the deed had fled, he turned and walked off in an opposite direction to call the assistance of other watchmen, and to endeavor, if possible, to arrest the villian who had perpetrated the foul deed. Scarcely had the watchman disappeared when the form of a stout and muscular man, apparently well dressed, issued from behind a large box that stood on the pavement hard by, and, approaching the man who lay upon the pavement, commenced a hurried search of his person, and after securing all the money and jewelry the man had about him, walked hurriedly away. For some cause not easily divined<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6641-00000004"/> vined at first thought, he started off in the same direction the watchman had taken, and after walking only a square and a half was met by the same watchman, who was returning in company with two others. As they met, one of the watchmen remarked to the stranger that he had better keep a good look out for high-way-men, as they were busily at work that night.</p> 
               <p>"Ha! any late depredations, gentlemen?" asked the stranger, apparently surprised at what he had heard.</p> 
               <p>"A man just now knocked and robbed," answered one of the watchmen; "be careful you do not meet with a like fate."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, sir; I shall endeavor to be on my guard," replied the stranger, with a peculiar bow of the head, and then passed on.</p> 
               <p>The stranger must have known the watchmen, or at least have known the beats they occupied, for he made directly to one just vacated by one of the men he met, and there stationed himself for an other victim. He had not to wait long, for scarcely had he secreted himself, partly behind a box, and partly behind the shade of a building, before a well dressed and dignified appearing gentleman made his unconscious approach upon the reptile's den. Just as he came opposite to where the stranger was concealed he received a stunning blow on the side of the head that felled him to the ground like an ox whose heart had been pierced with a leaden ball. The stranger was not long in securing the money and jewelry of this victim, and then shifted his quarters to an other part of the city.</p> 
               <p>By this time there was scarcely a street in the city in which a man had not been knocked down and robbed that night.</p> 
               <p>The stranger having found his two victims flush with money and valuable jewelry, concluded it best to make his way to safer quarters, having already made a profitable night's business of it.</p> 
               <p>As he was passing one of the alleys in the upper and remote part of the city, his attention was directed to a party of three individuals who stood but a short ways from him, and who seemed to be engaged in a dispute. Not wishing at that time to meddle with other people's business, he concluded to walk on, but as he turned to do so, a shrill clear voice rang out these words:</p> 
               <p>"You are a liar, sir! I am no thief, but an honest mechanic. I will not be searched by you, nor will I go with you to the calaboose!"</p> 
               <p>"Then we will take you by force," said a hollow-brained, bushy-headed watchmen, and two of them being present, they attempted to take him, as they had said, by force; but the honest mechanic being in possession of a good sized club, showed courage for a fight. The stranger having heard the latter part of the conversation, and observing the bravery of the mechanic and the advantages the watchmen had over him, was forced, by a natural impulse to thwart the efforts of the police, to rush upon the watchmen and assist the mechanic. With his aid the two "watchmen of the night" wore soon laid upon the ground, and the stranger and mechanic took their way into an other part of the city, where, after a short conversation, they separated.</p> 
                
               <p>The stranger then betook himself to the cluster of dark alleys in the north western part of the city, and while we were carelessly observing the odd construction of a dim lamp situated in that part of the city, he disappeared from our eight.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <p>The sun had already appeared above the eastern horizon, and was throwing his bright rays of light and heat full upon the bustling city, when the tall and manly form of a well dressed man might be seen issuing from the front door of a large and beautiful mansion in one of the fashionable parts of the city of St. Louis; and from thence passing down one of the principal streets leading to the commercial part of the great Emporium. It would not be difficult for a close observer to discover in the person of the character just described, the daring and successful high-way-man of last night. If the reader will accompany me to the reading room of the Merchants' Exchange, we will there see the same person, carelessly seated upon a chair by one of the tables deeply absorbed in reading one of the morning newspapers of the city. As he appears to be so deeply interested in the contents of the paper, let us take a peep over his shoulder and endeavor to find out what he is reading. Ah! it is the Reporter's column in which he finds so much of interest. Now he chuckles and laughs apparently with great exultation and satisfaction. Let us take a view of the Reporter's column:</p> 
               <p>"THIEVES, BURGLARS AND UIGH-WAY-MEN INFEST THE CITY BY SCORES!!!"</p> 
               <p>"Not less than ten or twelve men were last night knocked down and robbed in different parts of the city! Some were robbed of large sums of money and valuable jewelry, and several were so much injured that their recovery is doubtful. Two men were killed during the night. The perpetrators have not been detected."</p> 
               <p>"About fifteen gentlemen had their pockets picked while at the Theatre last night of sums of money varying from $50 to $500."</p> 
               <p>"No less than five stores and shops were last night broken into by daring burglars and robbed of money and valuable property to a large amount."</p> 
               <p>"It is impossible to determine how many trunks, on board of steamboats laying at the wharf, and hotels in the city, were last night, broken open and rifled of their contents, but the number is very great; besides numerous other depredations of a less serious notice. It is passing strange that so many deeds of daring and crime should be committed in this city, and that too, under the very eyes of our police, who apparently, do all they can, and yet do nothing. Notwithstanding the many depredations committed last night, but five persons were<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6641-00000005"/> arrested and secured in the Calaboose, but they, we think, are hopeful candidates for the Penitentiary!"-<title>City Paper.</title>
               </p> 
               <p>"And he might have added with equal truth," muttered the stranger, "where they will finish their education in the mystery of crime, and then be turned loose upon Community accomplished villians and desperadoes."</p> 
               <p>From the Exchange the stranger took his course back towards the tipper and remote part of the city, but before reaching his point of destination he was met by a young man apparently twenty four or live years of age, who immediately recognized and hailed him. It was the mechanic he had last night rescued from the officers; their recognition was mutual, and they accordingly linked arms and walked off together.</p> 
               <p>"I believe you told me your name was Fred Higbee, did you not?" remarked the stranger, as they walked along together, apparently no caring which way they went.</p> 
               <p>"The same, sir," replied the mechanic; "I hope you will do me the honor to give me your name in return."</p> 
               <p>"If you please, sir, I would be known only as Henry Grantham," replied the stranger.</p> 
               <p>"Harry Grant, for brevity and beauty, I suppose," retorted Higbee.</p> 
               <p>"As you like best, Mr. Higbee; immaterial to me which way. I hope you will like the name."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, any name does very well for an <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias,</foreign> and as I shall ever feel grateful to you for your kind interference in my behalf last night, I hope we will always remain friends."</p> 
               <p>"I hope so too, Mr. Higbee, as I am always a friend of the working class, for they are the only honest people in this community; and, although I profess not to be honest myself, I love honest people."</p> 
               <p>"That is a compliment, Mr. Grantham, but I nevertheless believe it quite true. I have long noticed the doings of the aristocracy and the monied portion of this city's inhabitants, and I do discover but little to recommend them in point of virtue and honesty."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Fred, you are very correct, but you know comparatively little of the doings of the wealthy to oppress and keep under the poorer and laboring portion of community. You have no idea what means they resort to to accomplish their objects; but should our acquaintance become familiar I may lead you into some of the secrets of the ways of the world that will make you open your eyes, and which may greatly benefit you if you should live to see much of the world. But I now remember, Mr. Higbee, I have an engagement at nine o'clock this morning which I must not fail to attend; I hope you will therefore excuse me for the present, and that we may soon meet again."</p> 
               <p>"You are at liberty, Harry; but you know where my shop is; I hope you will call."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I shall do so with pleasure. Farewell; good luck to you."</p> 
               <p>"Farewell, the same to you."</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <p>Night had again thrown her sable mantle o'er the face of nature, and the greater portion of the inhabitants of St. Louis were already wrapped in the refreshing embraces of Morpheus.</p> 
               <p>Let us now take our way from the scene of slumber to a more busy and animated portion of the city.</p> 
               <p>The town clock strikes twelve, thereby proclaiming the hour of midnight, and as that is the hour generally chosen for the commission, of great deeds, the reader most probably already divines the secret of our mission.</p> 
               <p>Go with me then to a dark alley in one of the remote and poorer portions of the city, and there you will BOO three men issuing from the darkness of the alley into the dimly lighted street. The three men seem to be well dressed, and appear to understand each other very well. They now separate, one going clown the square, and an other up it, and the third a cross street, leading down towards one of the principal streets of business. Let us follow this last person and endeavor to find out his business at such an hour of the night.</p> 
               <p>It is not necessary for us to be particular in observing localities, so we will only mention that we have followed the stranger to a certain square on which is situated the establishment of a wealthy broker. Here the stranger approaches the night watch, bows and speaks in a familiar manner, which is returned in an equally polite manner by the watchman.</p> 
               <p>"Is all right, Dick?" asked he in a low and cautious tone of voice.</p> 
               <p>"I believe so, Harry," was the watchman's reply.</p> 
               <p>"Then we will make quick work of it," observed the stranger, whom the watchman calls Harry. "In a few minutes my men will be here, and all we ask of you is to keep on the other corner of the street."</p> 
               <p>"Very good, Harry, you know I have already given my consent; but I run a great risk, for should you be detected it will play the devil with me. However, It will do that any how, for I will certainly be discharged to-morrow morning with no little disgrace."</p> 
               <p>"What need you care for that, so you get a pocket full of rocks?" said Harry.</p> 
               <p>"I do not care; not a d-n. You know I only became a watchman to give you a fair chance; and I hope you will not forget that act of kindness on my part."</p> 
               <p>"Forget it! no, sir, I will not. I never forget such things, as you very well know. Hark! Here cornea my men; do you now go to your post."</p> 
               <p>"I, I, sir."</p> 
               <p>The watchman retreated to the other corner of the square, and Harry advanced a few steps to meet his men.</p> 
               <p>"Well, my lads, did you see any thing that looked suspicious?" observed Harry as the two men approached.</p> 
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6641-00000006"/> 
               <p>"All is quiet, sir, is all right here?"</p> 
               <p>"All right, sir; now to work like fine fellows and we will soon be in luck-darn me if we wont! Ha! d'you see how nice the key fits. There, walk in my lads;-silence, now, d'you understand?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
               <p>With this the front door of the Broker's Office was carefully re-shut and the three men were safely locked inside. They then produced a dark lantern and struck a light. The safe was kept in a back room, and that room was barred with iron, but they soon proved themselves ingenious burglars, for it was not long before, they had made a way through the wall and were standing beside the ponderous iron safe. Here again they shewed equal skill, for in a few minutes the heavy door of the safe was swung open and the shining contents exposed to view.</p> 
               <p>A smile of triumph, rather than of avarice manteled the lips of the bold burglars.</p> 
               <p>For a moment they stood and gazed upon the treasure before them with great delight and satisfaction, but remembering that time might be precious to them they began to sorting it out. The money was principally in gold and silver coin, and they had no desire for any other kind.</p> 
               <p>They soon secured as much of the gold about their persons as they could well get away with, and then leaving the safe door open made their retreat with as little noise as possible. They were soon again on the street, and re-locking the front door made their way off as soon as possible, but all in different directions.</p> 
               <p>Let us follow Harry as he makes his way back to the dark alley. Before going far with his ponderous load of the jingling metal, he is met by a watchman who accosts him in rather a rough style, and demands to know what he is carrying. Being somewhat frustrated at this bold challenge, he did not at first reply, but kept on his way.</p> 
               <p>"Stop, sir!" demanded the watchman.</p> 
               <p>"I, I, d'you speak to me, sir?" replied Harry.</p> 
               <p>"I did, sir. Who are you, and what are you carrying?"</p> 
               <p>"That is none of your business, but nevertheless you shall know. Here is my card, sir; I am Mr. J--, a merchant on F-- street, I was sleeping in my establishment, but a few hours ago an attempt was made to rob me, and fearing lest an other attempt should be made I am carrying my gold to the house of a friend. Does that satisfy you, sir?"</p> 
               <p>"All right, sir, you know it was my duty to enquire, as I did not know you."</p> 
               <p>"Very good, sir; no harm done, but if you like you may walk along with me lest I might meet with robbers."</p> 
               <p>"I think there is no danger of that, sir, and then I cannot leave my watch. I hope you will therefore excuse me."</p> 
               <p>"Very good, sir; but I hope you will loan me a pistol for a few hours. I will return this way as soon as I have my money taken care of, and will leave it with you."</p> 
                
               <p>"Certainly, sir; I will do that with pleasure, but hope you may not have occasion to use it."</p> 
               <p>So Harry completely out-witted the watchman, which, however, is seldom hard to do, for they are generally such confounded fools that a child might deceive them; and where they are not fools they are mostly villians, and aid in promoting crime.</p> 
               <p>Harry without any more difficulty reached the entrance of the dark alley, and there found his two companions waiting for him. They feared lest he had been taken, for the route he came was the most difficult one to avoid detection. They were therefore greatly relieved when he made his appearance, and now we will follow the three men together to their place of destination.</p> 
               <p>About half way along the alley between the two streets, there stood a small but rather neat building which had the appearances of a dwelling house; and, in fact, it was used for that purpose, but still there was an other purpose for which it was used. The three men approached the back door of this house, and touching a secret spring the door was soon opened and they admitted into a small but beautifully furnished room. There was nothing in or about the room that would create any suspicion as to the true character of the house.-After a few words with the person who admitted them, they were given a light with which they proceeded to the cellar. The cellar was a dark room under ground, with comparatively nothing in it but barrels and boxes of various kinds. It had a slab stone bottom, one or two of which were very broad and long. The three men proceeded to lift one of these stones, which, when they had removed it, showed the mouth of a deep cave. There were steps down into the cave, and after two of the men had disappeared in the hole with the light, the third one also let himself down, and being a very muscular man he drew the stone after him until he had it square above the hole, and then letting himself down easy, the hole was again stopped up and the three daring and successful burglars were safely secreted in the bosom of the earth.</p> 
               <p>Before visiting them in this strange place, let us give them a little time to prepare for our august presence.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <p>Fred Higbee was a native of Boston, and learned his trade in one of the principal cabinet shops of that city. He moved to St. Louis, where he married a lady of some fortune and considerable respectability; and being a good mechanic he was soon able to own a respectable manufactory, when he carried on his trade quite extensively, and for two years appeared to be in a fair way for becoming a wealthy and much respected citizen. But as is often the case in<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6641-00000007"/> this transatory sphere or probationary state of existence, a reverse of fortune overtook the young mechanic, and he was forced to give up his extensive establishment and betake himself to a small but commodious shop in a more remote portion of the city, where he found it not difficult to make a decent living for his small family, and to lay up a small sum annually for the extension of his operations. It was during the early part of his change of fortune that he was first introduced to the reader of this tale.</p> 
               <p>On the night that Fred Higbee was rescued from the night watch by Harry Grantham, he had been passing down the dark alleys near whore the scene occurred, when the cry of "<emph>thief</emph>" was raised by one of the watchmen near to where he was, and the real thief having eluded the watchmen, when Fred Higbee was discovered by them they immediately laid claim to him; but the reader is already acquainted with his escape.</p> 
               <p>Fred Higbee, at the time above alluded to, lived in a small frame house on sixth street, where he had everything about him necessary to the furnishing of a commodious dwelling; and his family being small and not troublesome he was certainly happy, or, at least should have been so, situated as he then was.</p> 
               <p>His family consisted of himself, an amiable and obliging wife, a beautifel and promising son of three years, and a most charming young lady of sixteen summers, who was a sister to Fred Higbee's wife, and whose name was Mary Ann Devoy, whose extraction was French, but she was herself a native of St. Louis.</p> 
               <p>Since the acquaintance of Higbee with Harry Grantham, they had met on several occasions, and their intimacy was gradually increasing. Harry would frequently call at Higbee's shop where they would spend an hour or so together in the most friendly conversation. Harry had frequently been invited by Higbee to accompany him to his residence and become acquainted with his family, but he always declined the invitation without giving any reason to hope that he ever would accept it. This strange conduct Higbee could not well understand, and finally left off his entreaties and contented himself by tolling his family what a droll character he had awakened up for a friend; which excited in them a curiosity to see and form the acquaintance of Harry Grantham.</p> 
               <p>The morning after the commission of the burglary of which we gave an account in our last, chapter, Fred Higbee was seated in his shop reading one of the morning newspapers of the city, when his eyes wandered to the Reporter's column, where he read a detailed account of the proceedings of the burglars, and from which he learned that a very large sum of money had been stolen. He was yet meditating upon the subject when Harry Grantham made his appearance at the shop door, and lifting his head and discovering who his visitor was, he arose and saluted him in a very friendly manner, and then invited him to take a seat. After the compliments of the morning had passed between the two, Harry requested to know what news his friend had discovered, remarking that he had not read the morning papers yet.</p> 
               <p>"I have the news of a daring and successful burglary committed</p> 
               <p>last night on the establishment of N-- &amp; Co., very wealthy brokers, to the amount, it is supposed, of near fifty thousand dollars," replied Fred.</p> 
               <p>"What! last night? N-- &amp; Co. robbed of near fifty thousand dollars? Where was the watchman that he did not discover and prevent it?"</p> 
               <p>"The watchman! The papers state that he is suspected of having something to do with it himself, and he has been arrested and lodged in the Calaboose!"</p> 
               <p>"Is it possible? Do you know what the watchman's name is?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it is Dick M., he has only been on the watch a short time."</p> 
               <p>"Did they fine any thing about his person that led to the suspicion?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I believe not; but it is thought the deed could not have been committed without his knowing it, and that he must have been au accomplice in the crime."</p> 
               <p>"That will be hard for them to prove, I apprehend, although he may have been concerned. However, Fred, you may look upon that as a great crime, yet there may have been circumstances under which it was committed that stripped it of all that I consider really criminal."</p> 
               <p>"How so, Harry? I do not understand you."</p> 
               <p>"Suppose then, for illustration, that some laboring man had been swindled and cheated out of several hundred dollars by that establishment, and not being wealthy enough to go to law with them, had to submit to his loss. Then suppose that same man should conclude to take the law into his own hands, as wealthy men very often do, and should go and rob the establishment of several thousand dollars, would you think him as criminal in the eyes of justice as the men who first robbed him by taking advantage of his poverty?"</p> 
               <p>"No, I confess I would not think him as criminal; that is, his crime would not be as bad, morally speaking; yet his having been cheated by them would form no palliation for the enormity of his crime in the eyes of our law."</p> 
               <p>"Very true; and for that very reason I look upon our laws as calculated to ferment crime. The poor cannot get justice at the bars of our legal tribunals, and they therefore resort to means to obtain and retain their own, that are punishable as crimes by the laws that would not restore or protect their property, simply because they could not enter the temple of law and mocked justice with a pass of gold! Not only so, but by means of their gold the rich can commit daring depredations upon the property and rights of the poor, and our laws not be able to punish them. There is great need, my friend, for a reformation in our code of jurisprudence."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, Harry, and were I talented and educated my life should be spent in the reform movements of the age; but I am only<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6641-00000008"/> a poor mechenic, and as it gives me pain to think of these things, and of the wrong and misery throughout our country, I seldom allow myself to meditate upon them."</p> 
               <p>"At all events, Mr. Higbee, if all the money that was last night stolen from the wealthy brokers is in the hands of a working man, or even in the hands of men who respect industry, and who sympathize with poverty stricken people, and I believe robbers in general are friends of the poor, it will do more good in six months than it would have done in their iron safe in ten years. Therefore we have not much to regret in the commission of the crime."</p> 
               <p>"I cannot exactly agree with you, Harry, although the money may do more good in the hands of its present owners, than had it not been stolen, yet it must be at the expense of a guilty conscience for the commission of a great crime; for I look upon the commission of such deeds as encouragement for repetitions of the same, and of even more enormous crimes. It is therefore calculated to immoralize community, or at least one portion of community, and for that reason I think we arc all losers by the perpetration of that act."</p> 
               <p>"You are quite a moralist, Fred, and I have no doubt could preach a good sermon; but then you should remember that were there no immorality in the community, moralists would have nothing to do, and might therefore turn robbers themselves. But I am keeping you from your work, and will therefore take my leave."</p> 
               <p>And with this Harry Grantham took the hand of Higbee and pressing it warmly, quitted the shop.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <p>With the reader's permission we will now betake ourselves to the mysterious cave in the dark cellar whither we last accompanied the three bold and successful burglars, and endeavor there to learn something about the characters of those who inhabit it.</p> 
               <p>In order to get admission into that mysterious place, let us follow the steps of a man in whom it is not difficult to recognize the person and features of one of the three burglars we on a previous occasion saw entering the dark cavern.</p> 
               <p>He is just passing out of a large and fashionable Coffee House situated on Third Street, and from the direction he takes it is quite evident he is intending a visit to his subterraneous retreat.</p> 
               <p>It is in the dusk of evening; The streets are not yet lighted up, but still it is not difficult to follow the burglar as he carelessly walks along apparently as unconcerned as if he was the most honest and respectable man in the city. But as he approaches the vicinity where there are several dark alleys it behooves us to keep a sharp eye upon him or he will escape from our sight, and our pains to find and visit his retreat will be fruitless. There! quick, my boys, or he will be lost. See! he takes the dark alley-follow, or all is lost. We are successful, and have kept close upon the heels of the burglar, until we find him standing by the door of the little frame house spoken of in a previous chapter. Now he touches the spring and the door is opened and he enters. Let us follow. Here again we find ourselves in the cellar: now for a descent into the cave and an exploration of its mysterious caverns and apartments.</p> 
               <p>When we remove the large stone that covers the mouth of the cave, we at once discover a flight of stairs leading down into a dark reservoir, and after descending them we find ourselves in a small and roughly finished room, which has the appearance of being mererly a repository of vegetables during the winter season of the year; such, for instance, as potatoes, apples and various other fruits that must be kept from the frost.</p> 
               <p>I say this small room has the appearance of being provided and used for this purpose, and it would require an ingenious artist to discover any other use to which it is equally well adapted. Nevertheless when we observe the movements of the person we have followed thus far, we will soon discover him carefully examining the wall in one of the corners of the room. Now he touches a secret spring, which is so ingeniously fitted into the wall that we could not discover it. Hark! I hear a noise! Ah! 'tis the answer to the burglar's knock; now he returns it again. Hist! That mysterious sound! What meaneth it? Ah! now I understand: they are holding a conversation by means of sounds which none but themselves understand. Yes, I was rignt, for now they come to give him admittance. Ah! they do not suspect our presence. Here I the wall! did you see it give? I feared it would fall upon us, but now I discover a secret door swing open and the burglar is entering.-Quick, my boys! follow, if you would know more of this mysterious place. There, now be quiet. We have passed out of the little room and arc now traversing a dark and subterraneous passage many feet under ground. It appears to have been dug out, for it is walled up on either side, and has heavy planks at the top; is about four and a half feet high and about three feet wide. After going a short distance we come to a lamp suspended to one side of the passage, and immediately beyond the lamp is a small indenture into the wall and a kind of bed or couch made into it, and on this bed is stretched the body of u man who is undoubtedly on the watch.</p> 
               <p>Passing this person we keep on after our guide, the burglar, as we expect him to lead us into the secret recesses of the mysterious subterranean habitation.</p> 
               <p>We have now traversed the passage at least a hundred foot, but an yet have discovered nothing worth relating. But now we have come apparently to the end of the passage. Our guide and his companion have stopped to consult upon some important subject. Hark! let us hear what they say.</p> 
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6641-00000009"/> 
               <p>"There is an other thing, captain, I wish to tell you of. Black Jim and one or two others are out to-night intending to capture and bring in the prettiest girl in the city."</p> 
               <p>"The deuce they are!" replied the captain, for it was the captain of tin's lawless band of desperadoes we have been following. "What right had they to go on that expedition without my consent?"</p> 
               <p>"None, sir; none at all, but you have not been in for two or three days, and I believe to-night is their only chance of capturing her with safety; and trusting to your generosity and forbearance they chose to risk your displeasure rather than lose the handsome prize."</p> 
               <p>"I will see them when they return and talk to them upon the subject," said the captain. "Let us now enter and see what is to be done with our spoils. Ring the bell."</p> 
               <p>"I have done so," replied the man thus addressed by the captain. "Do you intend a division to-night!" he asked in a lower and more continuous tone of voice.</p> 
               <p>"We will determine upon that after we see how things look within," replied the Captain. And as he finished speaking a small door was thrown open and a flood of light burst upon the darkness of our retreat from the arge and well lighted room thus exposed to our view. Had it not been that we were only there in imagination we would undoubtedly then have been detected and paid for our rashness with our lives. But as fortune favors us we will follow into the room thus unceremoniously thrown open to our entrance. Here we are surprised to find a beautiful and commodious dwelling. The room is about eighteen by twenty-one feet, and is about eight feet high. Chairs, tables, cup-boards, looking glass, and, in fact, every thing necessary for a fashionable sitting room in any part of the city. Before describing any other part of the cavern, let us take an examination of the characters we here find in this room, apparently so comfortably situated.</p> 
               <p>All persons present united in lavishing a hearty welcome upon the captian, for he had, as his companion said, been absent for several days. Now they arc all seated around a large table on which is a number of bottles of various wines of very choice flavor. They are eight in number, and to begin we will say something about the Captain. This personage, we have only to inform the reader, is none other than Harry Grantham; and now that we have a full view of his person and features, we would say that he is about twenty-five or six years old; is full six feet high and well formed for gracefulness and muscular power. His physiognomy is very striking, and a phrenologist would say, from the formation of his head, that he is also possessed of remarkable mental stamina and ability. He is very good looking-is really handsome-his dark and curling hair hangs in ringlets down his shoulders, looking more like that of a woman's than that of a man's. His eyes are large and black; his forehead high, smooth and white as marble. But enough of Harry for the present, His companion, or the man who gave him admittance is called Tom White. He is about twenty-two or three years old, is about five feet six inches high, and has a resolute and sombre expression of countenance; is not bad looking, and seems to be a favorite, with the captain. To his left is the diminutive form of a man whom they call Little Bob. He is about thirty years old, is not more than five feet four inches high, but is remarkable for his cunning and ready wit; is very ingenious in almost any project that could be thought of as subservient to the purposes of the band. There are three other men present, but who are no ways remarkable in heir appearances. Besides these there are two women! Yes! two women! and from appearances they ate voluntary inhabitants of this strange place.-One of the women is very old, and of her we will have more to say hereafter. The other woman is only about five and twenty, and is very handsome. She is the mistress of Tom White, and appears to be deeply concerned in his welfare. But more of her anon.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <p>To take a more extensive view of this subterraneous habitation, Set us pass out of the beautiful room we first entered, through a heavy door on the side of the room opposite to where we come in at. This door appears to be designed as a barrier to prevent egress into the room, instead of out of it, as we would naturally suppose would have been the case.</p> 
               <p>But let us pass through. This we have now done, and, to our great astonishment, find ourselves inside of a hall about forty feet long and sixteen feet wide, and only about nine feet high. This hall is brilliantly lighted up by a large lamp which is suspended in the middle of the room. It has very much the appearance of the cabin of a steam boat, on a dark night, well lighted up, for all the way around the hall are doors leading back into small bedrooms. The hall itself is beautifully decorated and ornamented with brilliant paintings and carved works of the richest variety. It is used as the dining room for the whole band, which, from appearances, must number thirty or forty permanent residents in the cave, besides the outsiders that are undoubtedly connected with the clan.</p> 
               <p>But to leave the hall and examine the bedrooms. Ah! this we cannot do of ourselves. The doors are all locked. But, we will watch our opportunity to get a glimpse into them. Hark! what meaneth that noise? Ah! 'tis late in the night and some of the clan are returning. Let us also return to the first room and witness their entrance.</p> 
               <p>"Ha! Captain, Black Jim and his company are returning with their fair prize," were the words of Tom White as we entered the room where we left them a few moments previous.</p> 
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6641-00000010"/> 
               <p>"Very well, let them in," replied the captain, and with this the door opened and three men entered, bearing in their arms the prostrate and almost lifeless form of a most beautiful and lovely female of about sixteen years. Her dark auburn hair hung loose about her neck, which was very delicate, but white as alabaster.</p> 
               <p>Poor girl, she had been snatched from the bosom of friends and relatives to be dishonored and ruined by lawless hands. Oh! where is punishment too severe for such villiany and inhumanity? But let us observe the reception they receive from the captain. He bows coolly to them as they enter, and then turns his eyes towards the poor helpless female they have made a captive. Now he orders the hag, of whom we before spoke, to take charge of the poor girl and to restore her to consciousness as soon as possible. The old woman obeys, and, being assisted by Kate White, the mistress of Tom White, they carry the girl out of the room and take her back into one of the bedrooms we in vain endeavored to enter. Here they place her upon a soft and beautiful bed, and commence bathing her temples with spirits, and administer various restoratives to bring the insensible girl to her proper feelings and consciousness.-While they are thus endeavoring to reanimate the unfortunate girl and prepare her for a still more trying ordeal, let us return to the first room and learn something of the views and designs of the men.</p> 
               <p>"I discover you have made quite a prize, Jim,' observed the captain.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my good captain, a <emph>very</emph> handsome prize; but I am sorry you did not arrive a little sooner, that we could have had your consent to the expedition; I hope, however, you will be pleased to pardon us for this slight digression from our rules, as it might have been impossible to have captured her if delayed any longer."</p> 
               <p>"What great necessity did you have for such a prize, that led you to challenge your captain's displeasure?" observed the captain.</p> 
               <p>"O, none, except what nature is heir to," observed Jim, "and then YOU know, good captain, that nearly all the boys have their fair companions, and I have had none for the last six months."</p> 
               <p>"Since the death of your former mistress!" sarcastically observed the captain.</p> 
               <p>Jim made no reply, but Lung his head, for he feared the captain. would take charge of his pretty prisoner, as he knew he had a right to do according to the rules they had mutually agreed to be governed by, the prize being captured without the captain's consent.</p> 
               <p>Harry Grantham observing the downcast looks of Black Jim, remarked that he would first visit the young lady himself, and endeavor to learn something of her parents and her own situation in life, as he never allowed any infringement upon the right; or property of the poor and laboring classes of community; and with this dismissed the subject for the time being.</p> 
               <p>In the course of a few hours some eight or ten persons more of the clan had returned, bringing with them various prizes of money, jewelry, clothing and groceries.</p> 
                
               <p>In a short time after their return, arrangements were made for dividing the spoils of the last week's in-gathering. It was a rich division. On no previous occasion had they been able to divide so large an amount of money and valuable jewelry from one week's labor. Great harmony and order prevailed among the clan.</p> 
               <p>The captain was entitled to three eighths of the whole, and all the rest made equal shares of the balance. Having made their division, each man laid claim to his share and carried it off to his deposite. Scarcely had they returned from putting away their spoil when "a gogeous supper" was announced, and all repaired to the dining hall.</p> 
               <p>It was indeed a gorgeous supper. A king might have envied them their luxuries, so rich were their wines, and so choice and well seasoned were their numerous dishes. But we cannot take time to examine and describe all on the table. As soon as supper was over they all repaired again to the sitting room, where they indulged in merriment and "yarn-spinning" for several hours. Five of the men gave their experience in crime, and from the conversation we learned that no person was admitted to full fellowship in the clan, or to the secrets of the subterraneous habitation, that had not first been a Penitentiary convict.</p> 
               <p>From the experience of those who related them, we learned that invariably they had been imprisoned when very young for trilling offences, and after that for more serious ones, until they finally become disgusted with society, and from the inhumanity they deceived concluded that all men were villians, and that they had as good a right to what they could get as any one else. From this they plunged into more daring deeds and waded in crime until the Penitentiary became their homes. Then they began to look upon the wealthy and aristocratic as the mainsprings of all oppression and misery and wrong, and henceforth swore eternal vengeance and hatred to that portion of community. Thus were they <emph>made</emph> villians and <emph>taught</emph> iniquity.</p> 
               <p>And thus are thousands made desperate, when a little mild and persuasive treatment would have restored them to honesty and respectability. I lament with great sorrow the inhuman and unwise treatment young offenders receive at the hands of our judicial authorities. A mere child for the commission of a slight offence is thrown into prison, where he associates with the most abandoned and reckless villians the country is infested with; and while in their company partakes largely of their notions of villainy and crime, and being encouraged by them, as goon as he gains his liberty, again indulges in his petty deeds with a more bold and daring hand, and less compunctions of conscience. Such is the evil power and influence of this custom that once a person gets under its influence, it is almost impossible to redeem him from the iron grasp. He gradually, grows stronger and stronger, in his desires and feelings for a life of brilliant deeds of iniquity, and scarcely ever stops his progress until his education in crime is accomplished, and he goes<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6641-00000011"/> forth a <emph>graduate</emph> with a <emph>diploma</emph> of his <emph>profession,</emph> which enables him to enter the circles of society best suited for his <emph>practice!</emph>

               <p>It was late in the night, nearly daylight, although it is always night in their subterraneous home, that the clan dispersed from the sitting room and retired to snatch a few hours of sleep. Harry Grantham immediately summoned the old hag to his private room, and interrogated her as to the condition of the fair prisoner committed to her care; and was gratified to learn that she was then sleeping quietly, although she had manifested a determination of resistance to the utmost of her ability, being fully aware of her condition. Harry inquired of the hag if she had learned the name of the young lady, or any thing concerning her parentage and condition in life. To which she replied that the fair miss was entirely mute upon all subjects upon which she had spoken to her, save that she respected virtue and religion, and had declared that "resistance to tyranny was but justice to God," and that she meant to resist the cowardly and wicked advances of those who aim to ruin her with sacrilegious hands, until the last muscle of her frame was relaxed and her energy all gone.</p> 
               <p>"Noble girl! she deserves a better fate," mattered the captain.-He then asked to be admitted to the young lady's presence as BOOIA as she awoke from her slumbers, and having instructed the old hag as to what he wished her to do, she returned to the side of the young lady, and Harry began to dress himself in a disguise suitable to visit the fair prisoner in, that he might not be recognized by her, if she had ever seen him before, as might possibly have been the case, seeing that he travelled the city a great deal without a disguise.</p> 
               <p>It was not long before he was favored with the desired interview, and when he entered the room where sat the young lady waiting to receive him, he was greatly surprised to behold so fair and lovely a creature, and at the same time apparently composed in feelings and unagitated. As he entered the room the hag left it, and he and the young lady were alone. He advanced a few steps and kindly saluted her, but received no salutation in return. He then took a seat by her side and thus addressed her:</p> 
               <p>"My fair young lady, I am somewhat sorry for your Fake that it has been your misfortune to fall into the rude hands of my men, and if it is in my power to atone in any way for their rudeness I will most gladly do it. But allow me in the first place to inform you, that your capture was entirely without my consent and my advice, and as the captain of the men that made you a prize, I have a right to be heard as it regards your future destiny, I hope therefore that you will confide in me a few things which it is necessary for me to know, that I may act with caution, wisdom and prudence in your behalf."</p> 
               <p>"Sir," replied the young lady, "if it is in your power to restore me to nay friends unsullied, and have any inclination to do so, and will name your terms and give me any assurance of your veracity and intention to comply with the agreement, should we make one, I will t hen hear your interrogations and will answer, so far as I may think proper, but not before."</p> 
               <p>Well pleased at the evident courage and wisdom of the young lady, the captain replied as follows:</p> 
               <p>"I am well pleased, miss, with your mode of doing business; and as I have no reasons for witholding from you my designs, I will tell you at once, that your destiny, so far as your present condition is concerned, depends wholly upon circumstances entirely out of your control.</p> 
               <p>"To explain to you more fully your present condition and the nature of our association, I shall be compelled to enter into something of a narrative, which may not interest you much, and which, again, may interest you very much. However, I do not wish to intrude too long upon your patience, and with out your consent I will not enter upon it at present."</p> 
               <p>"If the narrative is in any way concerned with my liberty, I am anxious to hear it," replied the young lady.</p> 
               <p>"If I understood you aright," replied the captain, "in your conditions to give; me the information I require, it is necessary you should hear the narrative in order to enable you to judge whether it would be expedient for you to give such information or not."</p> 
               <p>"What is the information you wish?" demanded the young lady.</p> 
               <p>"That I can easily state," replied the captain, "and will do so with pleasure. In the first place, then, we wish to know what your name is, where you were born, what the professions of your parents are, or of your nearest relations if your parents are not living, and where they reside at present.</p> 
               <p>"In the second place we wish to know what your standing and condition in society is, if you are acknowledged to be one of the aristocracy, and if you are wealthy or considered so by your acquaintances. And, in the third place, we wish to know if any of your relations or yourself have ever been instrumental in having any person convicted to the Penitentiary. Upon hearing full and satisfactory answers to these questions, I will take it upon myself to answer for your safety and return to your liberty, or your perpetual confinement in this place the mistress of one of my men."</p> 
               <p>"Sir," said the young lady, indignant at the last remarks of the captain; "Sir, I cannot conceive how these questions or the answers to them can in any way effect my condition here. I observe you are H band of robbers, not only of the property of others, but of the rights and liberties and honor of the most innocent and inoffensive<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6641-00000012"/> portion of communities; and I have no doubt but you have poor, unfortunate creatures like myself in your hellish grasp, for which the God of innocence will wreak ample vengeance upon your guilty heads, and-"</p> 
               <p>"Be not too fast young lady, you know not the causes we have for our procedure, and if you will calmly listen to me for a short time, I will explain all to you: you will then know better how to act yourself, and will have, I have no doubt, quite a different idea of the man to whom you are now talking."</p> 
               <p>"Then I hope, sir, you will proceed with your narrative. My patience, I think, will enable me to hear it."</p> 
               <p>"Then I will inform you," commenced the captain, "of a part of my own history, and by so doing will explain to you the cause of my present, seemingly, inhuman position. When I was very young my mother died, leaving me the only child of my father, who was quite wealthy.</p> 
               <p>"In a few years after the death of my mother, my father also died, but without making a will. I was then taken charge of by one of my uncles, and lived with him until I was fourteen years old, when I was put to a trade. I thought very strange of this, as I was certainly heir to a large fortune, and remonstrated with my uncle, preferring an education to a trade. But my uncle had become my guardian, and finally bound me to my trade until I was twenty-one years of age. This was more than my proud spirit could bear, and so the first opportunity I had I ran off from my master, and went to one of the principal cities of the west. There I got into business as a clerk, but after serving six months an incident occurred that decided my fate for life. The man with whom I was employed was one night robbed of a large sum of money, and suspicion at once fell upon me, I was arrested and my things all searched, but no evidence found of my guilt. I was discharged, but was then "<emph>spotted</emph>" to the police. I was also discharged from my situation, even before I had time to discharge myself, as I intended doing. I then tried to procure an other situation, but for three weeks did I strive in vain, at the end of which time I was arrested as a <emph>vagrant,</emph> and sent to prison.-There I became acquainted with a young man who was a skilled thief and burglar. He related to me many things concerning the inhumanity and cruelty of the world, and taught me to look upon mankind as enemies of each other by mutual consent. I gave him my short history; he told me that my uncle would cheat me out of my fortune; I swore vengeance upon him if he did. After I got out of prison I was a good deal in the company of this young man, as he always had money and appeared friendly with me. On one occasion, not long after I was out, he gave me some money and clothing to enable me to leave the city, but before I left, he and an other young man and myself were arrested on a charge of burglary. The property stolen was nearly all found in our possession, although but a small portion of it was found with me. In vain did I protest and declare my innocence. We were tried and convicted. I was sentenced to five years imprisonment m the Penitentiary, and each of them to eight years. To be as brief as possible, I will pass over a few years, and will say, that when I returned to my uncle's, I found my fortune entirely out of my reach. I have never received aught but inhuman and barbarous treatment from my fellow beings, and it was because of this that I become the sworn foe of mankind. Nevertheless, I have never been illy treated by the poor and laboring portion of community, and I am therefore the sworn friend of the poor.</p> 
               <p>In order to have my revenge and to render justice to those who are instrumental in causing so much misery by degrading and disgracing others for trifling faults, I have organized this band of men. In our association we admit no person who has not been a Penitentiary convict, and even then he must be intelligent and well raised, so far as education and parentage are concerned; and hence my men are all intelligent and can appear in any society.</p> 
               <p>"And from the histories of my men I learn that the wealthy and aristocratic portions of community are the main causes of and supporters of those barbarious institutions unjustly called Penitentiaries, and which would be better named <emph>hells;</emph> for it would shock you to know how cruelly men are treated in them. We therefore have made it a rule never to infringe upon the poor or philanthropic, and for that purpose all expeditions of any importance arc first submitted to me, and without my consent no such expedition can be carried out. I can therefore say to you, that, if you are not one of the wealthy, aristocratic, or have not been influential in causing some one to be sent to the Penitentiary, I will procure for you your liberty, but it must be on the condition that you will solemnly promise not to reveal the existence of this clan in St. Louis, as it is not known that such an organization is in existence. I have been very brief, and have stated only a few things concerning our condition and inclinations.-Arc you now, prepared to answer my interrogations?"</p> 
               <p>"I am," was the young lady's reply. "But allow me to take a. little freedom in inquiring if there are others of my own sex who are forcibly detained in this place?"</p> 
               <p>"That, my fair lady, does not at present concern your own welfare; and after we have settled the matter as it regards yourself, we will talk of other matters."</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, sir, if I was too forward with my inquiry, but my anxiety for the welfare of my own sex is such that I spoke without thinking that I was myself a captive. But I am now anxious that you should know who I am, as I expect and hope to obtain my freedom by your knowledge of that fact. Know then that my name is Mary Ann Duvoy; my parents are both dead, but I live with my noble and generous brother-in-law, Frederick Higbee, who married my sister older than myself, and they are the only relations I have in this country."</p> 
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6641-00000013"/> 
               <p>"What! Fred Higbee your brother-in-law?" enquired the captain, evidently much surprised.</p> 
               <p>"He is," replied the lady.</p> 
               <p>"If that be true, young lady, and I can easily determine the fact, you may consider yourself as good as free. You shall not be harmed while I have power to prevent it, and now I hope you will content yourself until I return, as I must see my men and inform them of the mistake they have made, and must go and test the truth of your story, although I doubt it not in the least. I will have some trouble with the man that captured you, but I am his master, and he must submit.</p> 
               <p>"I will see that you arc made as comfortable as possible, and will leave my most trusty men to protect you during my absence."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! sir, how can I thank you for your generosity to me? May God forgive you your many faults and bless you for your charity."</p> 
               <p>With these words lingering upon the lips of the fair girl, Harry bade her a short "good bye" and then left the room, whither he sent Kato White with instructions to cheer and comfort the beautiful damsel.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <p>Harry Grantham immediately proceeded to the room occupied by Tom White, who was one of his most faithful men, and then communicated to him the discovery he had made, and stated to him his design for restoring the girl to her friends, as she was the sister-in-law of one of his esteemed friends. Tom White seldom opposed the wishes of his Captain, and on this occasion appeared to highly approve his generous intentions. Little Bob was consulted, and he, being always the friend of the fair sex, was greatly pleased to learn that the "fairest of the fair" was again to be restored to friends and freedom. After thus learning the opinions of two of his wisest counsellors, Harry gave them instructions to keep a strict watch tip-on the room where the young lady was incarcerated, lest Black Jim might take advantage of his absence and intrude upon the rights of the fair girl, and then instructing the old hag to be as indulgent as possible to her, and see that she was served with a good breakfast; he betook himself to the streets of the city just awakening from their heavy slumbers, that he might test the truth of what the young lady had told him.</p> 
               <p>On this occasion Harry was dressed in a disguise so that he would not even be recognised by his friend Higbee, should he meet him in the streets. He first visited Higbee's shop, not expecting, however, to find him there, for he fully believed all that the young lady had told him, but to learn if possible the circumstances of her capture, and something concerning the general opinion as to what had been her fate. He was not disappointed in his expectations, for upon arriving at the shop he found but one person, a journeyman, at work.</p> 
               <p>Upon enquiring of him for Mr. Higbee, he was told that he would not be in the shop probably all day, as he was much distressed from the disappearance of his sister-in-law, a very charming and lovely young girl of sixteen Pretending to be surprised at what he heard, he, Harry, asked the particulars of her disappearance, when he was informed that late the evening before, she set out with a young gentleman, a friend, to attend some exhibition in the upper part of the city; when, upon arriving opposite one of the dark alleys in that part of the city, the young man was knocked down by some person unseen, and left in a condition, apparently, lifeless; but when he came too he was unconscious how long he had lain, or what had become of the young lady. He was so much injured by the blow he received, that he lost his reason for a while, and was found by the night watch searching through the streets for the young lady. Higbee soon heard of the circumstances and nearly went distracted in consequence of it, for he considered her lost forever, although the whole police were immediately put upon the search, and it is thought if she is in the city they will find her.</p> 
               <p>This was all that Harry cared about learning just then, so he returned to the subterraneous retreat to make arrangements for her resration to her friends that evening, if possible. When he arrived in the sitting room he found his men nearly all there making preparations for breakfast, it then being near ten o'clock in the day. He immediately called his men around him, and communicated in a proper manner all that he had discovered concerning the young lady captured by black Jim, and then turning to the person just named he addressed him as follows:</p> 
               <p>"And I am very sorry, Jim, that you were so unfortunate as to choose beauty for your prize without regard to the principle we have mutually agreed to be governed by, viz: never to in fringe upon the rights or liberties of the industrious poor; and I am really sorry that we are compelled to deprive you of your fair prize, but I hope you will submit to the process with fortitude, as it will be the only punishment you will receive for transgression of your well known rules.</p> 
               <p>To these remarks of the captain, Jim attempted to make a reply, and to manifest his displeasure at being robbed by his companions, but his efforts was so weak and his words so faltering that no notice was taken of him. The company generally seemed to be well pleased with the promptness of their captain in protecting the rights of the poor, for he had taught them to look upon the industrious poor as the only persons to be respected by such men as they professed to be.</p> 
               <p>The matter was then settled that as soon as practicable the young lady should be restored to her friends. The captain therefore proceeded to her room and informed her of the arrangements he had<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6641-00000014"/> made, when she began to express her gratitude in such strains or eloquence that even the guilty heart of the burgler and robber could not help feeling the plastic touch of her generous and honest expressions. She was then anxious to take her leave of that dismal place, but being told by the captain that it would depend upon the extent of the excitement without, and the safety of conducting her to her friends, whether she returned that night or remained a week, she willingly consented to be as patient as possible until it would be entirely safe for her to be conducted home.</p> 
               <p>When evening come, Harry again returned upon the streets, but soon discovered that there was a strict watch upon all the alleys leading from his retreat into the part of the city he would have to conduct the young lady. He therefore returned and informed her of the facts, and stated it as his opinion that it would be several days before they could leave the cave with safety; but the young lady had by this time gained so much confidence in the Captain's good intentions, that she was willing to abide his own time for quitting the cave.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <p>Harry Grantham found the company and conversation of Mary Ann Duvoy so agreeable and entertaining, that he was induced to spend most of his time with her, which she did not object to, believing that she was more safe in his company than in any other's while she remained there. As a natural consequence a degree of familiarity sprang up between the two, which evidently would not decrease as long as she remained there and received the kind and polite treatment of the captain, with the assurance that upon the first safe opportunity she should be restored to her friends.</p> 
               <p>The second day of her sojourn in the Robbers' subterraneous home, she was permitted, in company with the captain, to explore some of its mysterious apartments, but was not permitted to enter or to know the contents of any of the small bed rooms that opened into the main hall, although she was very desirous of knowing whether others of her own sex were not therein confined. On the third day of her sojourn she assumed boldness enough to reproach the captain for his inhumanity to the fair beings of God's creation, in allowing even one to be detained and dishonored by his men; and begged him to use his influence to release them in so pathetic and feeling a manner, that it made a decided impression upon his hard heart. Long and earnestly did she plead with him in the behalf of her sisterhood, even with tears stealing down her fair and lilly cheeks, until his obdurate heart was again touched with the tenderness of her appeals, and he was willing to listen to words of mildness and sympathy. The fair girl discovering the good impression she had made, renewed with more energy her pleading in behalf of humanity. She asked the captain to consider himself a parent of a lovely and innocent daughter; and then to ask himself if he thought any person could be cruel enough to rob him of her, knowing the misery and anguish it must cause, not only to the innocent girl, but to the fond parents. She asked him to consider whether he gained any thing by thus allowing the innocent to be dishonored, and if he would not gain much more by extending his philanthropy to all innocent and honest persons whether rich or poor. She told him it was no sin to be rich, and that many wealthy persons were true philanthropists.-Thus did she appeal to him until, entirely overcome by her eloquence and pathos, he burst into tears, and covered his face with his hands.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! miss," he at length exclaimed, "how eloquent thou art.-How could I withstand such an appeal, coining from so sincere and unadulterated a heart? I cannot! I cannot! No! I will do my utmost to undo the wrong. But, Oh! God I what will become of me, so guilty, so debased?"</p> 
               <p>"Ah! sir," replied the fair girl, "it is not too late for you to do great good. You may yet undo all the wrong you have caused and repay the world ten fold by becoming a true philanthropist and Christian. Only form the resolution and you will find means to aid you in carrying it out."</p> 
               <p>"But I know not where to begin; a great burden is upon me. Here I have a band of men; I cannot disband and disperse them at my pleasure; for they all have a voice in that matter, and to leave them in possession of this cave and go my way would be to keep me always uneasy and in misery. Then again I would know not what to do with the girls we have here, who have been stolen from their parents and friends, and who are now dishonored and ruined. Oh! what can I do? No! no! I cannot reform! I am too guilty, I never could."</p> 
               <p>"Say not so," said the fair girl, "you must have patience, perseverence and determination, and you will find it a much more pleasant and easy task than you apprehend. I will even aid you in it myself, weak and insufficient as I am, if you but form a resolution to go through and thoroughly reform."</p> 
               <p>Thus did the anxious girl compromise her own interests, and, some would suppose, dignity, by offering to aid that guilty man to reform. Oh I what an example. How long would it have taken the laws of our country to have reformed that man? They could not do it at all, and yet a few words of sympathy and tenderness from an honest and virtuous girl have performed the wonderful work. It would be too tedious for us to give a full detail of the circumstances that followed. Let it suffice for us to say, that in two days more the fair girl was made acquainted with all the mysteries and secrete of the subterranean retreat of the St. Louis robbers, and fully entered into the plans of the captain for dispersing the band and liberating its poor and degraded captives. The men were called into council and the<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6641-00000015"/> question laid before them by their now repented and reformed captain. His eloquent and manly appeal had the desired effect. A majority voted for a total disbandment of the clan, and arrangements were immediately made for carrying it into effect. They had acquired a large amount of money, but now they could not restore it, and none wished to do so but the captain, and he contented himself with the determination to do good with what fell to his share, by aiding the poor and distressed. The women who were prisoners were very willing to be released upon almost any condition, and so it was arranged that the band should disperse by degrees until all the men were out of the reach of the law, and then that the cave should be thrown open for the prisoners to take their departure at pleasure, they being suitably provided for with clothes and money.</p> 
               <p>These arrangements being concluded, Harry began to make preparation for restoring Miss Devoy to her friencs, in which she united to assist him. Having learned that the watch was no longer kept at the dark alleys, they, on the fifth night of her sojourn in the cave took their departure from its darkness to the open streets of the city.</p> 
               <p>From the intimacy that had grown up between them, and the deep and suppressed sighs that escaped from the lips of Harry Grantham, one would be forced to the conclusion that something more ardent in its nature than mere gratitude or friendship existed between them. Nevertheless it is but justice to say, that Miss Devoy had not once thought of loving Harry, although it must be confessed that had she rightly known her own heart she would have been sensible of a growing passion towards him that could be termed nothing but pure and genuine love. But it cannot be denied that Harry was not deeply in love with her, but being sensible of his unworthiness of her, resolved to suppress his emotions as much as possible.</p> 
               <p>They had passed through the allies and were on the street on which Higbee liued, when Miss Devoy gently pressed Harry's hand and whispered to him, that perhaps he had better now leave her, as she could easily find her way home with safety. As she uttered these words Harry began to tremble, and his whole frame shook as though he was suffering from an attack of the ague. He attempted to speak but could not; he tried to walk on, but could not step without staggering. At this Miss Devoy was frightened, but fearful of betraying him who had protected her from ruin, she stopped and entreated him to tell her what was the matter, and what he wished her to do. She spoke in an affectionate manner, which helped to recall him to his proper feelings, when he at length replied, as follows:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Miss Devoy, how can I part with you? must I thus bid you farewell forever? Perdition seize me if I cannot live to enjoy your charms. Oh! you have told me you forgave me of my numerous faults, but could you love one whose hands have been guilty of so many crimes; yet, thank God, othey have never shed human blood?</p> 
               <p>"Harry! Harry! this is no place to talk of love; I will talk with you upon that subject at another time, and I will not now say you have no reason to hope for the best."</p> 
               <p>These words, spoken almost thoughtlessly by Miss Devoy, inspired Harry with new life, when he immediately asked her how he could have the unspeakable pleasure of seeing and conversing with her; to which she replied, that she had already agreed not to reveal to any one who was her deliverer from captivity, and as he, Harry Grantham, Was acquainted with her brother-in-law, Fred Higbee, he could easily be introduced to the family by him, and thus without suspicion afford them an opportunity of talking the matter over.</p> 
               <p>"Good!" exclaimed Harry, "you are an angel; but I must leave the city immediately and dare not return for a long time; will you be faithful until such time as I can safely return?"</p> 
               <p>"Trust me, Harry; I will always remember you and hope you will remember me, for I am now well assured of your complete reformation of life, and I forgive you all your sins."</p> 
               <p>"Then, farewell. May God bless you and be your great protector." Harry could say no more, but pressed his head with one of his hands and took a parting farewell of the young lady with the other. She spoke in a tender manner to him, and after commending him likewise to the protection of God, they parted; she to go to her forsaken home, and he to return to his subterranean retreat to make arrangements for quitting it forever.</p> 
               <p>It would be impossible for us to describe the joyful scene that occurred upon the return of Miss Devoy to her brother-in-law's. After the momentary excitement had sub sided, she related to her brother-in-law and sister the main features of her singular adventure, and of her deliverance by the captain, but kept back such circumstances that occurred as would compromise in any way the agreement she had made not to expose or reveal their situation or locality. They were greatly amused with her Story, and could not refrain from occasionally indulging in risibility, and frequently would speak in glowing terms of the captain's generosity and noble-heartedness.</p> 
               <p>Harry returned to the cave and there found his men anxiously awaiting his return. He immediately gave his orders, and that night all the men left the cave except Harry, Tom White and Little Bob. All those that quitted the cave were immediately to quit the city, and not to return to it under three years.<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6641-00000016"/> In two days after the men left, Harry went round to all the bed rooms and unlocked the doors, letting into the main hall about fifteen skeletons of what were once beautiful and blooming young girls, as innocent as the little birds on a bright May morning. The scene was a sad one, and forced many tears from the eyes of that once very wicked but now repented man.</p> 
               <p>He spoke kindly to each of the girls, and asked them to forgive him for his cruelty towards them, which they all seemed to do with a good will. He then placed into the hands of each a sum of money to the amount of about one thousand dollars to each girl, and telling them that in a few hours they would be permitted to go whither they wished, he advised them to remain and consult with each other until they could hit upon some plan to leave without exciting suspicion, lest they might get into difficulty. They took his advice, and late that evening quitted the cave and betook themselves to the different boarding houses in the city, from whence many of them were received by the parents or friends as long lost children, or as spirits from the Tomb.</p> 
               <p>Harry Grantham immediately quitted the city and visited the east. There he looked around him for opportunities of doing good, and never let one pass him, when it was in his power, without embracing it. He did not there go by the name of Harry Grantham, but by his benevolence and charity, Harry Summerville became, in a short time, a very distinguished and popular man.</p>

               <p>Harry Grantham, or rather Harry Summerville, as we must hereafter know him by the latter name, was soon successful in establishing himself in a prosperous business in one of our eastern cities, where he found ample opportunities of being charitable and benevolent, and by his promptness in embracing them and his munificent donations to useful institutions, he soon acquired a fame well merited by his philanthrophy and liberality. Near two years had passed since he left St. Louis, but he had received frequent intelligence of the constancy of her he loved, and was, at the time of which we write, preparing to return to the scene of his former iniquities, not however, to lay waste and destroy, or cause misery and orrow, but to make glad the heart of her who had taught him righteousness and humanity, by making her his bride, as she was already the idol of all his affections. In due course of time he arrived in St. Louis, and hastening directly to where his friend Fred Higbee then resided, great was the joy and rejoicings occasioned by the meeting of friends and lovers. Miss Devoy was there, and yet retained all her loveliness and modest beauty. Her kind heart still warmly beat with gratitude, friendship and love, and was returned with equal devotion and sincerity upon the part of Harry Summerville, who had grown somewhat more sedate in appearance, but who retained all his former elasticity, vivacity, and voluptuous good humor. Fred Higbee gave him a warm reception, and having been made acquainted with the relation existing between his sister-in-law and Harry, by the former with the latter's permission, he felt duly bound to give him a cheerful and hearty reception in token of his gratitude for the great services he had rendered to Miss Devoy during her captivity, and in restoring her to freedom and friends unsullied. Not wishing to give the full details of the preparations and marriage ceremonies, we will only remark, that in a few weeks after his return to St. Louis, Harry Summerville, a wealthy merchant and distinguished philanthropist of the east, led the fair Miss Mary Ann Devoy to the hymeneal altar, where he espoused her as his lawful wife in the presence of an admiring crowd of gay and fashionable persons.</p> 
               <p>It only remains for us now to remark, that Harry and his beautiful bride live peaceably and happy together in the city of Boston, the admired and beloved of all Christian and philanthropic persons. They are both noted for their eminent piety and great charity, and many have been the sad and desolate hearths they have made lively, cheerful and happy. Long may they live to do good to their fellow beings.</p> 
               <p>Little Bob is living with Harry, and is a great favorite with Mrs. Summerville. He is yet gay and lively, and retains his wit and cunning so that Ire is frequently the cause of great mirth and innocent amusement to the guests at Harry's house.</p> 
               <p>Tom White, soon after the disbandonment of the clan at St. Louis, by the advice of Harry, espoused his former mistress, Kate, as his lawful wife; and they are now living together happy and prosperous in one of the New England States.</p> 
               <p>The old hag, of whom we spoke, was the mother of Kate, Tom White's mistress, and was an abandoned woman, but by the earnest appeals of her daughter was restored to repentance and a virtuous life, and her last days are now, being spent in peace and tranquility with her affectionate daughter, and kind and indulgent son-in-law, Tom White. Peace to them while they live, and when they die perpetual peace to their ashes.</p>
