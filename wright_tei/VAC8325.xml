               <head type="sub">THE CHIEF AT HOME.-THE EXPEDITION PLANNED.</head> 
               <p>THE Barony of Bear and Bantry forms the extreme south-west point of the county of Cork.</p> 
               <p>The singular and excessive wildness of this district <unclear>is</unclear> however occasionally relieved by the fertility of some spots and the grandeur and beauty of others. The bay of Bantry from almost any point of view, exhibits one of the nobles prospects on a scale of romantic magnitude that imagination can well conceive. The extent of the great body of water from the eastern extremity to the ocean, is about twenty-five miles-the breadth, including the islands, from six to eight. It contains, besides some small, two very large islands, differing extremely from each other in quality and appearance, but perfectly suited to the respective purposes of their different situations. Bear Island is very high, rocky, and coarse standing a little within the mouth of the bay, braves the fury of the western waves, and forms, by the shelter of its body, a most secure and spacious haven.</p> 
               <p>The scene of our story lies chiefly at Beare-haven, and among the wild mountains in its immediate neighbourhood.</p> 
               <p>The whole population of this district bore the name of Sullivan, for the use of the antecedent vowel was strictly confined to the head of the Clan. In the present degenerate days, this distinction is completely lost. The O' is no longer the mark of high birth, but it was once a designation of lofty bearing and proud import.</p> 
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8325-00000003"/> 
               <p>If by chance a Carty, a Leary, or a Discrol from the adjacent districts became a resident in The O'Sullivan's country, he soon dropped his "<hi rend="i"/>foreign" patronymic, aud assumed that of the Clan among whom he had become a settler. Thus every one in the district was a Sullivan; and, as the stock of favourite christian names is not very extensive, it happened that, peaking in round numbers, a tract of ten miles could boast of so less than fifty Johns, forty Williams, and thirty Murty Sullivans. This state of affairs rendered some mode of distinguishing a particular John, William, and Murty necessary; they were therefore called, after the name of their residences, as <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Shane Cooleagh</foreign>-after the colour of their complexion, as William <foreign xml:lang="GAI">duve</foreign>-from some peculiarity of character, as Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tongue arrigud.</foreign> Again, if a William Sullivan happened to have been in Spain, he was called William <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Spaunaugh;</foreign> or, if Murty had killed his man-a circumstance of not uncommon occurrence-he at once was distinguished by the badge of <unclear>baronetcy</unclear>, and known as Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Lauve Darrig,</foreign> or "Murty of the Red Hand." Some of their <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sobriquets</foreign> were, indeed as they still remain, it may be said <emph>are,</emph> whimsical enough, which these instances will serve to illustrate.</p> 
               <p>A gentleman, when crossing the mountains which divide York and Kerry, met a poor man with whom he entered into conversation respecting the land held by him and the land-lord to whom he paid his rent. "Who is your landlord?" Mr. Lieutenant," was the reply. "That's an odd name: is he a new settler here?" "Oh no, bless your honor; he's of the raal ould stock-the right O'Sullivan Beare." "Why then call him Mr. Lieutenant?" "Why, is he not afther serving his Majesty in the militia?" Again meeting a personage whose singular appearance, led inquiries as to who that was? the answer came; "That's O'Sullivan Dismal." "Dismal enough, without question; but is he thus called from his appearance?" "Oh no! he's a worthy, good-humoured gentleman; but he thus called from his place out there yonder, the house on the bleak promontory-that's Mount Dismal."</p> 
               <p>About the middle of the last century, therefore, in the wild district of Beare-haven, stood an old mansion called Ross Mac Owen. This building, like all the habitations of the nobility and gentry of that period, combined within its strong walls the very different requisites of a residence and a fortress.</p> 
               <p>Society at the time of our story was very singularly constituted in Ireland.</p> 
               <p>The old idea of feudal allegiance to the head of the Sept on clan, still lingered in the hearts of the peasantry-as, indeed it does to some extent in the present day.</p> 
               <p>This feeling was not a mere blind slavish submission to the will and wishes of a mere superior in point of wealth and station. The chief was looked upon rather as the father or elder brother of his vassals-and indeed was of the same stock or family.</p> 
               <p>If the clansman obeyed his chief-gave him a share of the proceeds of the chase and the fishery-the chief was no less bound to give his retainer land and cottage-to defend him if attacked, to succour and aid him in misfortune and sickness and to find a roof to shelter his grey hairs when age had destroyed his strength and vigor.</p> 
               <p>It was something of this feeling that led the eternally-famous Flora MacDonald to peril reputation and life in the endeavor to save Charles Edward from the fangs of the pursuing English troops, that scoured the Highlands of Scotland.</p> 
               <p>In the remote and wild portion of the Green Isle, penetrated by the clear waters of Bantry Bay this feeling, passion, or sentiment-which you please-was still in its full strength, and The O'Sullivan's spite of many follies and even crimes could still count upon receiving the aid of their adherents for almost any purpose.</p> 
               <p>The oppressions inflicted upon the native Irish by the soldiers of Cromwell and William had sown the seed of bitter hatred, and men could be easily induced to act against any parties that seemed to be in any way the agents or officials of the English government.</p> 
               <p>Men who in all other circumstances were generous, hospitable and kind, even to a fault, became under the influence of national hatred, selfish, cruel and vindictive. Ready to obey any behest that promised revenge.</p> 
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8325-00000004"/> 
               <p>After what had been said, it may be almost unnecessary to inform the reader that "the Court," as it was styled, of Ross Mac Owen belonged to an O'Sullivan. The name of "Court" was given to this mansion from the inclosed space in which it stood, or from the regal establishment which its Lor supported.</p> 
               <p>If behind "The Court" towered the rugged and inhospitable "Mountain of Hungry Hill," the "Court" itself, notwithstanding an accordance in outward appearance, presented within abundant proof that its huge kitchen merited a far different name.</p> 
               <p>The possessor of Ross Mac Owen had been christened, we believe, simply Murty Sullivan after his father, grandfather, greatgrandfather, and a host of cousins too numerous for particular mention. During his father's lifetime, he was distinguished as Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Oge,</foreign> which in English signifies Murty <emph>the younger,</emph> and which appellation he continued, long after the decease of his worthy parent.</p> 
               <p>Few Old Bailey criminals had more <foreign xml:lang="LAT">aliases,</foreign> after their names than Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Oge</foreign> O'Sullivan Beare, as he proudly but improperly wrote himself, always taking particular care to flourish the <hi rend="i"/>O' of six times greater size than the other letters, which his relative and namesake, Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tougue Arrigud,</foreign> the school-master at Kenmare, remarked, "made Murty Oge's signature look, for all the world, like a turkey's egg in a wren's nest!"</p> 
               <p>Murty Oge, when in England or in English society, exchanged his proper name for the more romantic, yet familiar sounding one of <emph>Mortimer.</emph> Having made frequent excursions to the Continent, he was, on his returns, spoken of among his clansmen as "Murty the Rover," while on the coasts of France and Spain he was not merely known, but celebrated in song as "The Bold Captain Sullivan," and at the courts of those countries he assumed the style and dignity of the Earl of Bearhaven, and had been actually received as such.</p> 
               <p>We therefore introduce the reader to Murty Oge,-<foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> Mr. Mortimer O'Sullivan,-<foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> Murty the Rover,-<foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> the Bold Captain Sullivan,-<foreign xml:lang="LAT">alias</foreign> the Earl of Bearhaven of Ross Mac Owen-a square-built little gentleman with a well-curled periwig and a three-cocked hat edged round with gold lace. In age, his lordship of Bearhaven appeared to be about fifty having a red, jolly, weather-beaten face, seamed by three or four severe scars, which could not be said to disfigure, as they tended to give a marked expression to it. That expression when assumed, spoke determination of purpose, and was preceded by the fixedness of a remarkably large light blue eye (for Murty Oge had but <emph>one</emph>) and the energetic compression of the lips. But this was far from being the ordinary expression of The O'Sullivan-so we shall in future generally call him on the contrary, there was a wandering, drunken leer in his look, and a good-humored grin displayed a mouthful of formidable tusks, rather than teeth.</p> 
               <p>To the establishment supported by The O'Sullivan at Ross Mac Owen, we have already applied the term regal, and perhaps not incorrectly, as it was little dissimilar to that of Erin's monarch in the days of old- <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Ere her faithless sons betrayed her,</l> 
                        <l>When Malachi wore the collar of gold</l> 
                        <l>That he won from the proud invader."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan-Beare maintained a body-guard of twelve stout followers, each of whom was provided with cutlass and pistols. From a crowd of clansmen and retainers, to the amount of about forty, who were daily to be found in the spacious kitchen of Ross Mac Owen, we shall particularize Philip Sullivan, or "Piping Phil," as he was more commonly called, whose social qualities, united to some skill on the bagpipes, rendered him an universal favorite.</p> 
               <p>He had been blind from an early age, but so little did the loss of sight affect his animal spirits, that "Piping Phil" was notoriously the merriest fellow in the Barony. No wedding could take place within twenty, ay, we may say within forty miles of Ross Mac Owen without the aid of Phil's harmony. In short, mirth and music were with blind Philip Sullivan wherever he went.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan-Beare was comfortably seated at his breakfast-table on the 23rd day of October, A. D. 1748, at about five<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8325-00000005"/> minutes before nine, A. M. Were it not that the hour satisfactorily proves the meal to be intended for breakfast, appearances would rather indicate the more substantial repast of dinner. Here is no tea, no coffee, no eggs, no toast, no muffins even bread is wanting; but in place thereof stands a huge, untempting-looking ham, of murky and bristly exterior-a <unclear>pile</unclear> of oysters of monstrous size-slices of delicious salmon broiled upon arbutus skewers which send forth a savory odor, and a wooden bowl filled with smoking potatoes. A black quart bottle "half full and half empty," with a horn goblet, were deposited beside the plate of the Chieftain, and on the floor near him was a large earthen pitcher of spring water.</p> 
               <p>"This salmon is excellent," muttered The O'Sullivan; excellent indeed!" he repeated, after the disappearance of several slices; "from the richness of the curd it cannot have been above ten minutes out of the water. Holla!" he exclaimed, rising and going to the window, before which stood four or five of his followers: "Holla, boys! where did you catch the little salmon this morning?"</p> 
               <p>"It was I that cotched him, plase your honour, said Daniel Connell,-or, as he was now called, Daniel <emph>Sullivan,</emph>-stepping up to the window with a smile and a kind of a bow; "'twas surely that cotched the thief of the world clare an' clane out of the wather, as snug as the gowlden salmon that's upon the top of Shandon steeple in Cork all the ways, an' 'tis often myse'f has looked up at that same."</p> 
               <p>"Where did you catch him, Dan?" said The O'Sullivan.</p> 
               <p>"Is it where I cotched the fellow? Och! thin if ever a salmon was foolish, 'tis that crather that your honour's afther <unclear>acting</unclear> was the fool entirely to come where he did! Why thin did you ever hear, Sir, what the pinkeen said to the salmon? Your honour knows what a pinkeen is,-a little bit of a fish not half the size of one's thumb-Oh, not half the size! Well, a salmon was once upon a time pinned in a nit, and there was a little pinkeen in along wid him; to be sure that has often happened before, an will often happen agin' widout any kind of doubt; but this salmon, you see, Sir, had been ever an' always talking at the poor little pinkeen, for his being so small entirely, an' he was always boasthing of his own grand size. Well, whin the pinkeen saw the nit was round about 'em both complately, he turns to salmon, who niver saw a bit o' what was going on, no was dreaming of sich a thing-an' says he 'Is it proud you are of your size this mornin'. Mr. Salmon?' 'Surely I am says the salmon, 'an' 'tis a quare quistion, an' a mighty <unclear>quare</unclear> one too, for sich a little bit of a crather as yourself to axe me '<emph>Bathershin,</emph>-may be so!' says the pinkeen. That was the very word, an' not another did he say, but out wid him through the nit, laving the salmon <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in quod.</foreign> Well, plase your honour whin I cotched the salmon a while ago 'twas the very same word I said; <emph>Bathershin</emph> says I."</p> 
               <p>"But <emph>where</emph> did you catch him, Dan?" said The O'Sullivan asking the question for the third time. This, however, was nothing extraordinary, for Dan-the masther's own <hi rend="i"/>Valley de Cham as he styled himself-never, if he could possibly avoid it, gave a direct answer to any question whatsoever.</p> 
               <p>"I cotched him in a mighty proper place, to be shure, Sir, said Dan; "an' isn't it a wondher now that he wouldn't have known betther than to come there?"</p> 
               <p>"Where <emph>was</emph> it, Dan?" said The O'Sullivan at last, with some impatience of manner.</p> 
               <p>"Why, in the kitchen to be shure, your Honour," returned Dan, "where else? quite convanient to one's hand, an' jist in proper time to broil for your Honour's breakfast."</p> 
               <p>Singular as this account may appear of the capture of the salmon by Daniel Connell-whom we will so call henceforward for the sake of distinction, instead of by his assumed name of Sullivan-it was nevertheless perfectly correct. Through the kitchen of Murty Oge's house at Ross Mac Owen ran a considerable stream of water, which was guarded at one end by a strong iron grating; and thus a desirable convenience was afforded for the important Irish culinary operations of washing fish and potatoes. This grating, when, by chance, a stray trout or salmon made its appearance in the stream, rendered the further progress of the fish impossible; and, on the passage by which, according to Dan's notions, they so foolishly entered<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8325-00000006"/> being closed, their capture was certain. Hence "salmon and sea-trout were frequently taken as well as dressed in O'Sullivan's kitchen."</p> 
               <p>The Chieftain, who had proceeded to the breakfast-table, now returned to the window with the horn goblet in his hand,-like the bottle before described, "half full and half empty" of whiskey. "Here, Dan," said he, after putting it to his own lips, "that salmon deserves a drink this morning."</p> 
               <p>"Och thin, long life to your honour! an' long may you reign over us, an' good luck attind you wherever you go, night an' day; an' here's luck to us all, an' more luck too, an luck's mother for that matther!" returned Dan, and then, with voracious swallow, this "whiskey-devouring Irishman," tossed off at a breath the contents of the goblet: "'Tis the right stuff, the real nat'ral kind," said he, "that jist tickles one's throat like a dhrop of oil on a feather; may luck attind our honour," he added, placing the goblet on the window-sill, "I niver tasted the aqual of it; betther can't be."</p> 
               <p>"In faith, Dan," said The O'Sullivan with a smile, "I stand somewhat in need of your wishes for luck; here is the 23rd of october, and no cutter is in the bay! Here is the 23rd of october, and no news, good nor bad, from William, not a word even of his embarkation at Cork! Come in, Connell, I want to speak to you in private," added The O'Sullivan, shutting down the window.</p> 
               <p>"Why thin," inquired Dan in the tone of surprise as he entered the parlour, and cautiously closed the door, "have you ever hard from William since he left Ross Mac Owen; 'tis as good as fourteen days or better may be?"</p> 
               <p>"Not one word from him, nor <emph>of</emph> him," said The O'Sullivan with emphasis, "which astonishes me still more: here is," he continued, "the 23rd day of October, and no letters from france. Some screw is loose, Dan, something is wrong; and there has been that prying scoundrel, Puxley, down about this quarter no less than twice within the last week. I can't take him out. You must look after him the next time he makes his appearance. I asked him to dine with me on Sunday when I overtook him coming across the red bog."</p> 
                
               <p>"I'll be bail your honor did that same," said Dan; "If 't was your worst innemy, the Divil himself, you were afther meeting coming acrass the red bog, let alone Puxley the schaming thief an' decaiver! Why thin, Sir, 'tis my notion that 'tis afther the coming in of the cutther he's looking our so keenly; for that very same day whin your honor met him in the red bog, 'twas my luck to meet him likewise, an' says he to me: 'Honest man,' says he; 'Iss, indeed, calling <emph>me</emph> honest man!" said Dan with a smile which was half a grin. "'Do you know,' says he, whin the cutther is expected at Bearehaven?' 'What cutther, Sir?' says I purtending not to know what he was axing about, 'Why, Misther Sullivan's an' ye know he has many a cutther, let alone his great brigantine, says he. 'I'm Misther Sullivan myse'f,' says I, 'but the niver a cutther or hooker, nor as much as a fishingboat have I-the niver a one, Sir.' 'Oh,' says he-'honest man 'agin!-' 'tis Mr. Murthy Oge's cutther, Misther O' Sullivan's cutther, I was inquiring afther; she has been gone a long time from Bearehaven. 'I think your honor seems to know all about her, says I, an' so I said no more."</p> 
               <p>"Why did not you tell me this before, Dan?" said The O'Sullivan with impatience. "By heavens! 'tis an infamous scheme of Puxley and his gang; I am certain they are sworn to destroy me."</p> 
               <p>"My curse light on 'em, the thieves o' the world, to be meddling an' making wid what doesn't consarn 'em the laste in life! I'll ingage it's long till the dirty spalpeens would be afther mindin' their own affairs, as cutely as they bother about our's. Why thin, if I may be so bould as to axe the quistion, isn't it a crying shame to be letting him <emph>informers</emph> have the upper hand of us in this sort of a way? Shure an' 'tis the boys an' the counthry could show 'em the differ, if once our blood was up for a ruction. Oh murder in Irish, how we'd lick every mother's son of 'em!-that is, wid your honor's lave, sir."</p> 
               <p>"I do not doubt your fighting propensities, Dan," quickly responded The O'Sullivan, "and perhaps the time is nigh at hand when I will let you prove them; but just now we must<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8325-00000007"/> be prudent, and conceal our plans until it is fit to bring them into action: I have much upon my mind, Dan!"</p> 
               <p>The trusty <hi rend="i"/>Valley de Cham fixed an anxious eye upon his master, but respectfully forbore to break the short pause that followed, as Murty Oge leisurely drew forth his snuff-box, tapped the lid, then raised it, and, having taken an ample pinch, offered the same to Dan, who, with a low bow, and an-"I thank ye kindly, Sir,"-tittillated his nasal organs so effectively, that frequent loud and hearty sneezes followed.</p> 
               <p>The Chief emphatically repeated, "I tell you I <emph>have</emph> much upon my mind, Dan! captain William has disappointed me grievously of late; he is become so self-willed that all my sound advice to him goes to the winds!"</p> 
               <p>"Thrue for you, faith!"</p> 
               <p>"Zounds! 'tis enough to set one mad!" cried the irritated Murty; "why Dan, only remember how the captain failed in that deeplaid scheme of ours, which, like an idiot, I entrusted to his management at the Court of France. To my certain knowledge when Will was, by appointment, to have met Lally, and other of Charles Edward's friends, to concert some most important measures, the thoughtless fool was found gallanting a French opera-dancer!"</p> 
               <p>"Och, thim women they'd bother the Danes!" vehemently cried Dan Connell, stamping his right foot, and snapping his fingers, "To be shure," he continued, "Captain Will is a fine, slashing, off-handed follow; but to my mind, there's one would bate him fairly wid the girls if he'd do his endeavors to compass that same."</p> 
               <p>"What are you at now, Dan?"</p> 
               <p>"Is it what am I at? Why thin, Masther honey, couldn't ye guess?" said Dan in a tone and with an air of wheedling fondness.</p> 
               <p>"Not I, and as usual I suppose I might vainly try to make you speak out plainly. Dan, for once in your life will you come to the point?"</p> 
               <p>"May be I will, and may be I won't," returned Connell with a knowing wink, and a shake of the head, that were irresistably comic.</p> 
                
               <p>"Well, follow your own vagary. "But without any more of your nonsense just say-that is if you <emph>can</emph> answer a straight forward question-have you told all that passed between you and Puxley?"</p> 
               <p>"Why thin, sir, not quite entirely, in respect of my having been all the ways to the <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Fodeen,</foreign> (small estate) o' Puxley Hall an' a nate, snug, tasty, little place it is, anyhow, for the likes o' that thieving chap to be livin' in!"</p> 
               <p>"You, Dan! <emph>you</emph> at Puxley Hall! that is indeed extra-ordinary."</p> 
               <p>"Remarkable extronary, shure enough, you honor! an a dhroll thing in airnest! But you see it was my luck to meet that thraitor of a Puxley <emph>fornent</emph> me, jist as I was comin' acrass the strame convanient to his own gate; an' says he to me, 'Honest man,' says he-"</p> 
               <p>"Confound your rigmaroles! you told me all he said about The Rose," interrupted Murty Oge, impatiently.</p> 
               <p>"Ah thin bless you now, Masther dear! an' don't be so contrairy, but lave off that quare way o' bothering a person whin he's telling a story, an' thin shure you'll have mine in a jiffy!-Well, why-afther his talk about the cutther-our own darlint 'Rose-' what did Puxley do, but ask me in at his grate gate, an' shure in dacent manners I couldn't refuse, in particulars as I was wantin' to see how the land lay; so in I went, and walked up the aveney, cheek by jowl wid the rapscallion, till we comed to the parlour windy, an' there widin was a sight o middlemen an' reveny offichers, an' proctors, an' <emph>residenters,</emph> an' sich scum o' the earth! all atin an' dhrinking for the bare life! An' so says Puxley, 'Come, Master Sullivan,' says he, 'I'll give you something to dhrink to our fur ther acquaintance; "an' wid that, in he goes to the house, an' throwin' up the windy, he hands me a glass of stiff grog, an' says he, quite free an' asy, 'Now, Masther Sullivan, plaze to give us a toast.'"</p> 
               <p>"And what did you give?" said Murty Oge, eagerly.</p> 
               <p>"The health o' the King an' the Prince to be shure-what else? which else? which, your honor know, might mane<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8325-00000008"/> aither King James an' his son Charles Edward (the sowl!) or the Hanover rat an' the Prince of Wales!"</p> 
               <p>"Well done! i'faith-well done!" cried The O'Sullivan, exultantly "And what said Puxley to such a poser as that?"</p> 
               <p>"He fills up a bumper of Port, an' whisking it up to his mouth, he says, "Well, Misther Sullivan, I'll give you a toast in return;-Honor and honesty, man! Honor and honesty!" says he.</p> 
               <p>"Thank ye kindly, Sir, for dhrinkin' the health o' your <emph>absint friends!</emph>" says I, poking in my head at the windy, an' grinnin' an' bowing all round to the company; an' wid that I put down my empty glass on the windy-sill, an' cutting my stick marched down the aveney, as slow an' as grand as an Irish Brigade's man!"</p> 
               <p>Murty Oge's thoughts were frequently as rapid as his actions, and changed their tone in the passing of a moment, when a new idea crossed his mind. Some such transition of feeling now seemed to seize it, for his habitually-wandering eye suddenly settled into a fixed stare, and his whole countenance changed, as he turned abruptly round, and with startling energy exclaimed, "It shall be done!"</p> 
               <p>"By the powers, that bates cockfighting!" cried Connell, "may I niver die in sin! but that bates cockfighting!"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>What?</emph>" said the O'Sullivan, peevishly.</p> 
               <p>"Why to see how my draam o' last night comes out this blessed mornin' Sir, I belave <emph>the good people</emph> were playing their pranks in my noddle, an' mocked me fairly last night; for, as I'm a sinner, I draamed o' <emph>her</emph> too, Sir!"</p> 
               <p>"Of who?" said Murty Oge with an abstracted air that seemed as if, absorbed in other thoughts, he asked the question almost unconsciously. "Musha! thin o' the beautiful darlint that out of her cradle your honour an' mysef spirited over the saas wid my shisther Nora many summers ago! who else?" replied Dan, drawing up as if rather offended at his master's inattention.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Eva--"</p> 
               <p>"Whisht-<emph>a'ragal!</emph>-Whist!" cried Dan Connell, looking about with alarm in every feature.-"Oh! vo vo! Isn't it enough to draw the sowl out of a Christin to hear ye like a poor <foreign xml:lang="GAI">gomal</foreign> (idiot) spaakin' names in that kind of a way, whin the walls have ears, an' tongues too for that matther? Masther, jewel! it's a dale more gumption I gave ye credit for!" added Connell with an air of self-respect and reproachful affection.</p> 
               <p>"Well! well! I believe you are right, and I will be more cautious in future; but now we are on the subject, Dan, tell me what sort of a creature she was when you saw her four years ago-the time I sent you to France with the last remittance; but I remember you said she was pretty."</p> 
               <p>"What, purty!-why she's exthramely beautiful!-wid eyes as blue as the sky of a summer's night, an' as bright as the stars that shine in it; wid skin as white as milk, an' cheeks like blush roses, an' lips like twin-cherries, an' hair as soft as the curling mists upon Hungry Hill!-purty, <foreign xml:lang="GAI">inagh!</foreign>"-replied Dan, indignant at the puerile epithet his master had applied to the fair object of discussion.</p> 
               <p>"Whew-e-w!" whistled the O'Sullivan. "Why, Dan," he added, bursting into what is vulgarly styled a horse-laugh, "you describe like a poet."</p> 
               <p>"Whist, now!" cried Dan Connell, with a comic look of deprecation; "Your Honor will not be afther comparing me with one of those crack-brained jintry that jingles their lies, faix! up there at your house, jist."</p> 
               <p>"Up where, Dan?" inquired The O'Sullivan, absently.</p> 
               <p>"Where I gave the toast, bad 'cess to 'em-in Puxley Hall my darlint."</p> 
               <p>As if a wasp had stung him, O'Sullivan sprang to his feet at mention of the word, thus betraying the thought that was uppermost in his mind, and fixing his one eye upon the face of his obsequious <hi rend="i"/>Valley de Sham, it emitted sparks of fire, while the whole countenance of the Irish Chieftain worked so fearfully that even Dan, who had seen him often in his worst moods, grew a shade paler, and his eyes looked anxious while he silently bent them on his master. At length, Dan Connell,<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8325-00000009"/> who never could be silent long, let fall from his lips the name of "Lord Ogilvie."</p> 
               <p>"Ogilvie! Hah! he'd better cross the tiger in his path than to meddle with me or mine," shouted The O'Sullivan; "I believe that Ogilvie suspects my object in regard to my French enterprise, and has cast an eye in that direction, himself, we shall see whether be bears off the prize so easily as he imagines."</p> 
               <p>"Fair! bother him!" cried Dan; "that such a bird o' passage suld have the power to vex your Honor-"</p> 
               <p>"He!" cried The O'Sulivan, with a smile of utter scorn. "I thought not of his lordship. It was <emph>another</emph>-</p> 
               <p>He paused, and again his countenance worked in that terrific manner which had, at first, startled his attendant.</p> 
               <p>A long drawn and scarcely audible "Ah!" was breathed by Dan Connell, as he now fixed his intelligent eyes on his master, and instinctively clutched at the handle of his dagger.</p> 
               <p>At this intimation from Dan that he was understood, The O'Sullivan suddenly vented one of those tremendous explosions of laughter which so strangely contrasted with the terrible earnestness and stealthy reticence of his former manner.</p> 
               <p>"Summon my bold rovers to my presence. I wish to see how they appear, as it is long since they were engaged in any perilous enterprise."</p> 
               <p>About fifteen stern and hardy veterans, armed to the teeth, appeared before. The Sullivan, at a summons from Dan Connell, who had been absent scarcely two minutes from the presence of his master.</p> 
               <p>Having addressed them all pleasantly, yet with the dignity becoming his station, and having examined their arms, he bade them hold themselves in readiness, as work might be, ere long, required of them.</p> 
               <p>Still, it would appear that The O'Sullivan contemplated no immediate act of violence; and had not circumstances wrought his already inflamed mind to madness, we might have been spared the following recital.</p> 
                
               <p>Having treated his men to their favorite Innishowen, he expressed his wish to be alone.</p> 
               <p>His followers obeyed, and the Chief, as if relieved by their absence, gave himself entirely up to the consideration of his present position, and arrangement of his future plans.</p> 
               <p>His first movement was to examine the letters which had arrived at Ross Mac Owen during the day.</p> 
               <p>Among the varied communications, one arrested his attention in a peculiar degree. It came from a distant relative who resided in the neighborhood of Dublin, and conveyed the startling intelligence that Mr. Puxley had given information to the Government, which stated his strong suspicion-almost amounting to conviction-that Marty Oge O'Sullivan of Ross Mac Owen had to a certainty enlisted a number of men for the Irish Brigade in the French service, in which it was asserted he had recently been appointed to a Captain's commission.</p> 
               <p>"Hah! he lies!" muttered the Chief through his clenched teeth, as he clutched the paper he held. "So falsehood, as usual, directs the minion Hanover rat, and Treason lurks even among my own 'Wild Geese.'" As he uttered these words he burst into a loud laugh of derision that assorted well with the reckless bravo air which indescribably marked his attitude and bearing.</p> 
               <p>"Ho there!" he shouted, after a moment's pause. "Ho there!"</p> 
               <p>The well-known summons brought the trusty Dan directly to his side.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! thin, what's the matther, Masther jewel, wid ye <emph>now!</emph>" demanded Connell in the strained attitude of close attention, as he involuntarily asked the question, on perceiving the frightfully-excited appearance of the chief.</p> 
               <p>"Matter enough!-ay, matter which may peril both our cause and lives!" ejaculated The O'Sullivan, his lips foaming with passion. "That comb of the Devil, Puxley" he added in a tone of vehement exasperation, "has by bribery and corruption discovered the whole secret of our Volunteer Associations, and reported it to government; for which black deed my heart's curse on him!" he shouted, with a face livid with<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8325-00000010"/> rage, and striking the table violently as he spoke. "I now renounce at once and forever all idea of temporizing with this jackal of the German Elector, as I intended when I left the Castle of Ardea-for his information to my enemies must upset my best-laid schemes!"</p> 
               <p>There was a momentary pause, during which Connell fixed a deep and scrutinizing gaze upon his master.</p> 
               <p>As he did so, an exulting smile of frightful import lighted up his face, which became pale as death, when, springing from the opposite side of the table to that where The O'Sullivan stood, he grappled at his throat, and, putting his mouth quite close to his ear, he hoarsely whispered-</p> 
               <p>"Puxley must be <emph>murdhered!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan's large and lustrous eye glared still more wildly than before, his face became of ashy paleness, and his whole person and countenance assumed an aspect as highly excited as that of insanity.</p> 
               <p>'<emph>When-where-how</emph> shall the deed of Death be done?" he demanded, in a suppressed but steady voice of demoniacal determination.</p> 
               <p>"In the lone path that laads through the Glin to the divil' turf, where the Hathens' Church is built!" replied Connell.</p> 
               <p>"That is the <emph>where</emph>-now for the <emph>how</emph> and the <emph>when!</emph>" muttered The O'Sullivan with unflinching ferocity, and in deep accents which sounded like the murmur of the thunder-cloud before it bursts.</p> 
               <p>"Lave the <emph>how</emph> to <emph>this!</emph>" shouted Connell, extending to their utmost stretch the fingers of the huge hand which he steadily held forth.</p> 
               <p>"At your peril, defraud me of <emph>my</emph> prey! By <emph>my</emph> hand the bloody Exciseman dies! But I am no <emph>murderer,</emph> and it shall be in fair and open combat," uttered The O'Sullivan Beare, in a low, concentrated voice, almost inarticulate with wrath.</p> 
               <p>"Thin be it so. Yit remimber, sorra' a son o' Adam but your blessed se'f should bar me o' the glory o' that deed!" ejaculated Connell, grinding his teeth with rage at being obliged to relinquish it, even to the master he adored.</p> 
               <p>"Tis well." cried The O'Sullivan, breathing one deep and fervent curse, as he locked his associate's hand within his own in token of their fearful compact. The <emph>where</emph> you have rightly fixed-the <emph>when</emph> shall be on Sunday next! And now I wish to be alone,' he added, waving his hand with a sort of savage dignity towards the door, in intimation that he desired to digest in solitude the full details of the atrocious enterprise which engrossed his thoughts.</p>

               <p>A lovelier morning never rose than that which was destined for the murder of the unfortunate Mr. Puxley, and never did an autumnal sun shed its beams on a sublimer landscape than that which was selected as the ground for its perpetration.</p> 
               <p>The celebrated cataract which, collected from different springs, forms a large lake close to the broad, bare head of the lofty and almost perpendicular mountain miscalled. "Hungry <emph>Hill</emph>" was, in consequence of the violence of recent rains swollen to the fullest force. The prospect from the summit of this extraordidary mountain is extremely remarkable and extensive. The whole of the magnificent Bay of Bantry can be seen from it, mapped out, as it were, with every creek and estuary.</p> 
               <p>The singular cascades of Hungry Hill shoot through an extraordinary natural groove which equally divides a colossal rock on the top of the upper fall, and then rush down the precipice in a splendid sheet of water more than ten yards in breadth.</p> 
               <p>This expands as it leaps onward, until, bursting against a mass of stone midway down the steep, the waters; from the velocity of their fall and resistance to such a barrier, rise in volumes of vapour up a third portion of the mountain.</p> 
               <p>While the sun's rays played over those mists in flashes so radiantly reflected as to produce the iris tints and forms of mimic rainbows, the visual deception was so great and the brilliance so intense, that it seemed as if unearthly light was<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8325-00000011"/> flung abroad by some invisible agent, to render the effect upon the eye almost overpowering. From rock to rocks innumerable this remarkable cataract dashes from its first natural terrace, till, having reached a second, its jets of water cascade in the form of arches so enormous that herds of goats feed tranquilly beneath them.</p> 
               <p>Shooting along the minor declivities of Hungry Hill, those stupendous streams roll on through scenes of awful beauty, till they mingle with the wide blue expanse of the Bay of Bantry.</p> 
               <p>Mountains of gigantic elevation guard that celebrated harbor from the western storms, and within one of their most enchanting recesses lies the exquisite valley of Glengariff. Its verdant embowered glen clothed with flowering arbutus, holly, birch, and a thousand deciduous trees that grow, as it were, out of the clefts of the rocks in unpruned luxuriance, present the loveliest contrast to the surrounding bold and craggy mountains.</p> 
               <p>Seven hundred yards above the level of the bay, Hungry Hill, with its stupendous cataract, is visible from Bearhaven, though fourteen miles distant from that locality.</p> 
               <p>The Gnoul mountain, with its narrow gap and splintered peak-the Esk, and a long chain of noble crags, which, as the traveller winds on his way, burst every moment into sight in endless combinations of novelty, immensity, and beauty, oppose in strong relief the luxuriant vegetation and widely-stretching woods that clothe the eastern side of Bantry Bay.</p> 
               <p>Its fine indentations concentrate the harbour of Glengariff into a form so perfect, and so depressed at the base of the mountains, that it looks like a small silver lake beneath you, though in reality of considerable size.</p> 
               <p>All this, and much more than pen or pencil can depict, render the scene we have attempted to describe a masterpiece of Nature, scarcely surpassed among the lovely combinations which, with no unsparing hand, she scatters over earth.</p> 
               <p>The silence was so breathless, that the stirring of a leaf would meet the ear. A herd of goats, browsing peacefully among the heather, looked, listened, and then started forward like frightened deer as the boughs of a magnificent tree were cautiously pushed aside by some one breaking on their solitude.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan, with two silver-hilted pistols in his belt and a large cutlass at his side, emerged from the shadows accompanied by Dan Connell and a few of his armed Pirates.</p> 
               <p>"The Exciseman ought to pass down yonder path," said The O'Sullivan, deliberately pointing to one which led to the winding road that conducted to the village church of Bearhaven. "On, boys! On! Follow me to the Great Rock, behind which we must lie in ambush till he comes. But mark me," he added, turning sharply round and addressing his followers in his most peremptory tone, "he who stirs one inch to defraud me of my vengeance, or to aid me in it, dies by this hand!" stretching it forth as he uttered this ferocious threat, and gnashing his teeth in suspended rage. Then, after a momentary pause, he said in a hoarse tone,-</p> 
               <p>"My brave Sea-rovers! I only brought you here to act in case that Puxley's cursed gang appear. Cleave <emph>their</emph> skulls and welcome if they attack us!-but leave HIM to me!"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>We will!</emph>" fiercely ejaculated the Buccaneers as if with one voice.</p> 
               <p>"Then follow me!"</p> 
               <p>The command was obeyed in perfect silence, and without the utterance of another word the party proceeded until they reached the perpendicular rock indicated by their Chief.</p> 
               <p>This rock in a single shaft shot upwards to the elevation o many feet, a little to the right of a very broad slab of table land that stretched to the verge of a frightful declivity, clothed with tangled shrubs, and which slanted to a wooded hollow of profound depth below.</p> 
               <p>At the extremity of the level ground that intervened between the stone shaft and the precipice, one of the most singular of the many picturesque shapes with which this region of crags, clouds, and waters abound, presented itself.</p> 
               <p>An enormous mass of dark grey rock enclosed, like a barrier, that side of the table-land which lay towards the sea, and so<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8325-00000012"/> closely as to leave only a narrow path to wind round the projecting shoulder of the adjacent mountain.</p> 
               <p>This towering eminence not only shut in the area we have described, but curved downwards to the edge of the dark cleft below, and in such a fantastic shape, that when the eye looked through the aperture thus formed as through a sort of natural telescope, nothing caught it but the dark blue sky beyond, and a small portion of the mountains in perspective.</p> 
               <p>Such was the singular locality through which Mr. Puxley was obliged to pass on this particular day; and, as the Irish Buccaneers crouched behind the lofty shaft, where in obedience to their chief they were to lie in ambush, each man held his formidable cutlass ready for action, but without giving utterance to the thoughts oi blood that filled his heart.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan placed himself so that his keen eye could espy the object of his meditated vengeance the moment he appeared, and scarcely had he done so when at some distance Mr. Puxley, alone and on horseback, was seen slowly descending the mountain-path through a woody ravine.</p> 
               <p>"The Exciseman is alone. At your peril lay concealed, and stir not an inch. No-not if you saw me weltering in my blood!" whispered The O'Sullivan deliberately to his men. On hearing those words, the Pirates seemed disposed to parley; but a glance at their Chieftain told it would be vain, and, in displeased and disappointed silence, each man kissed his cutlass, in token of acquiescence.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, the unconscious object of such accumulated hatred had advanced at a slow pace, and seemingly absorbed in thought.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan by a violent effort restrained his impatience until Mr. Puxley neared the place of his concealment, when, wildly rushing from behind the shaft of rock, he uttered one fearful curse, and stood-a pistol in each hand-right before his victim.</p> 
               <p>So startling was the abruptness of this act that Puxley's horse reared and threw his master; then, flying as if on the wings of the wind, the affrighted animal galloped furiously away, striking fire with his hoofs from the rocks that hemmed in his narrow path.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Puxley leaped to his feet unhurt.</p> 
               <p>"Villain! would you attack an unarmed man?" he asked with unflinching self-possession.</p> 
               <p>"By the soul of my father-No!" shouted The O'Sullivan, thrusting one of the loaded pistols into Puxley's hand; "And now, liar, defend yourself, or meet the death you've worked for and deserved so long!"</p> 
               <p>With those words he started back a few paces-raised his pistol-and, with steady and determined aim, ejaculated,-"Fire!"</p> 
               <p>The suddenness of the act deprived the unfortunate Puxley of his usual self-command, and panic-struck, he failed to draw the trigger of the weapon he received.</p> 
               <p>It dropped, without discharging, to the ground, unknown to The O'Sullivan, who fired, and shot his victim through the heart!</p> 
               <p>The next moment he fell dead without a groan at the feet of his murderer!</p> 
               <p>The Chief rushed forward and bent over the body.</p> 
               <p>When thus leaning down, he ascertained that life had fled for ever, and saw that Puxley's pistol had never been aimed against himself, the flush of his face was succeeded by a livid hue-his glazed eye seemed starting from its socket, and the expression of his features became fearfully convulsed.</p> 
               <p>On the dark countenances of the Pirates who crowded round him, savage fury mingled with wild triumph was depicted, as they stood motionless gazing on the principal actor in the scene.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan dropped his pistol, clapsed his hands upon his forehead, and as in silence he looked down upon the bleeding corpse, it seemed as if a feeling of remorse entered his iron bosom.</p> 
               <p>If it <emph>did,</emph> the effect was only momentary, for the next instant, turning with a steady and determined air to his followers, he said in a low, hoarse voice-</p> 
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8325-00000013"/> 
               <p>"Speak not a word!-conceal the body behind the rock till midnight; <emph>then</emph> take it to the hooker, and plunge it fathoms deep into the sea."</p> 
               <p>As Dan Connell and the Buccaneers obeyed the first part of this order, and were in the act of drawing away the corpse, the discordant shriek of a bird of prey startled from its dark haunt was heard above the hills, and the next instant a body of armed men poured in through the natural arch we have described.</p> 
               <p>This unexpected party appeared, from their position more numerous than they actually were, and struck such astonishment though not dismay into the hearts of the Pirates, that for an instant they paused in their guilty task.</p> 
               <p>At the same moment, the armed strangers turned abruptly round the corner of the rock which, as we have already mentioned, hung in a fantastic arch over the furthest end of the broad spot of table-land within some feet of the precipice beneath.</p> 
               <p>The road which lay between this singular screen of stone and the steep beside it was almost instantaneously occupied to the verge by the unknown group.</p> 
               <p>How many additional men were at the other side of the crag could only be conjectured, but the short space between it and the angle of the mountain was-as seen through the rocky arch-completely filled.</p> 
               <p>All had passed with the rapidity of lightning, and, before the Irish Buccaneers could rally round and warn their Chief, who wrapt in thought stood sullen and apart upon the ground which reeked with Puxley's blood, Lord Ogilvie, with a band of armed men just landed at Bearhaven, surrounded him.</p> 
               <p>"Hah! Murderer-thus I arrest you!"-cried our hero, as with one glance of horror and amaze, comprehending the whole scene, he seized The O'Sullivan's shoulder with an iron gripe.</p> 
               <p>The strength seemed almost superhuman with which the Pirate-Chieftain shook himself free from the mighty grasp, while drawing his cutlass and whirling it with a fearful sweep, so as to make two or three desperate cuts, he shouted forth:-</p> 
                
               <p>"So I-as the beagle tracks the hare, thirsting for blood-ye dare me in my own mountain pass!-Have at ye <emph>all!</emph>" thundered The O'Sullivan as (seeing defence was useless against forces so superior to his own) he with effective vengeance dashed his blade at random amongst his foes, and, ere they suspected his intention, sprang down the precipice, which was so overgrown with brushwood, that no eye could penetrate its matted surface.</p> 
               <p>No step less practised than that of The O'Sullivan could tread the dangerous pass down which he so suddenly disappeared, hid by the thick trees of that dark ravine.</p> 
               <p>Bullet after bullet was fired after him, with what success no man could tell; while the Pirates, endeavoring like their leader to escape, all parties engaged in a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">melee</foreign> of broil and disorder which only served to stimulate the fury of the fight.</p> 
               <p>Dan Connell, with the rage of a madman, and so taken by surprise that for the first time in his life he fought without skill or method, flew at the throat of Ogilvie, as if a demon had entered into him.</p> 
               <p>The thrust was parried, and after a short struggle for life of death Connell was secured.</p> 
               <p>"Put him in irons with our prisoners!" cried our hero to a body of his men, who with their united strength found it no easy matter to force the redoubted Pirate backwards.</p> 
               <p>Then turning round with his usual self-command, Lord Ogilvie once more stood his ground against the desperate ruffians, who, some trying to fly, others to assault, still made HIM the special object of their vengeance.</p> 
               <p>Maddened at the capture of Dan Connell and hoping to effect a diversion that might further his escape, the Irish Buccaneers struggled in different directions to make for the various mountain-passes which they knew so well-success attending them in some instances, death in others.</p> 
               <p>The ground, under such circumstances, was soon entirely cleared.</p> 
               <p>The hills around echoed the discharges of several pistols issuing from the pirates, who, concealed from human ken,<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8325-00000014"/> thus, even in the act of flying from their foes, took ambushed vengeance.</p> 
               <p>The contents, however, passed harmlessly over the heads of the agitated group, and in a few moments all was once more comparatively silent.</p> 
               <p>On that evening, a party of five persons was assembled in the old Quolagh House, a residence of the O'Sullivans, a castellated building, massive in structure and of very primitive architecture.</p> 
               <p>The party consisted of The O'Sullivan himself, who had so miraculously escaped from Ogilvie and his men, together with five of his retainers, one of whom was a gigantic Rapparee.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely had they felicitated themselves on their safety, and lamented the capture of Don Connell, when that individual made his sudden and very unexpected appearance in their midst.</p> 
               <p>The account which he gave of his escape from his captors took up more time in the telling than the reader would be willing to spare in reading it, interlarded as it was with characteristic remarks, and allusions to matter pertaining to those days which have no interest to the present generation.</p> 
               <p>In few words, he had made his escape from a window, the iron bars of which were so rusty as to yield to his pressure. The joy of The O'Sullivan at the safety of his dependent could leave no doubt on the mind of the latter that his services were appreciated and his friendship returned.</p> 
               <p>"But it does my heart good to see your honor so brisk and merry," finished Dan; "like an illigant rollicking lord as you are, every inch of you, an' as I was saying, the other day, tis yourself that could bate wid the girls a thousand times over, if you'll only do your endeavor to compass that same."</p> 
               <p>"Oh then, <emph>I</emph> was the person you meant, as likely to prove the captain's successful rival with the fair sex," rejoined The O'Sullivan, with a grim of exquisite self complacency.</p> 
               <p>"To be sure thin! who else? for, as thrue as I'm standing here, egg or bird, ye'd but marry some darlint, wid oceans o' money to reign over us in Ross Mac Owen, I warrant ye'd throw a bone to Captain Will, that, cute as he is, he wouldn't pick in a hurry!"</p> 
               <p>"Marry; <emph>I</emph> marry! Oh Dan, I'm too old for that!" chuckled Murty Oge, with an air that evidently implied a desire to have the assertion disproved.</p> 
               <p>"Too ould! the divil a bit! betther late than niver; shure, an't I your Honor's own fosther-brother? an' wasn't I only fifty-two last Patrick's-day? an' may be Judy Malone would'nt jump to say 'Iss,'-if I gave her but 'casion! What, ould! faix'en, barring the want o' your Honor's two front teeth, ye're as fine a moral of a man as ye'd see on a month o' Sundays; an' as to a nate-turned ankle, fellow me the likes o' your Honor's, to dance cover the buckle all over the counthry!"</p> 
               <p>To this recapitulation of his physical perfections Murty Oge listened with delighted attention, and the climax of Connell's picturesque description was received with a burst of laughter, which displayed to the greatest advantage The O' Sullivan's mouthful of tusks, as green as his favorite element, at the same time revealing the wide space, which Dan, having never heard of Nature's abhorrence of a vacuum, considered but a trifling defect.</p> 
               <p>"None are all evil," says Byron; "none are all ugly," say we of our graver tribe of varacious biographers; for certain it is Murty Oge <emph>did</emph> possess the "nate-turned ankle" Dan mentioned, and of which his master was notoriously vain. Stretching out his handsome limb in a position which seemed a practical illustration of "putting the best foot foremost," The O'Sullivan eyed it with delicious self-complacency, as, with a leer like that of drunken wisdom, he exclaimed, "By Heavens, Dan! I believe you have given a hint I ought not to despise. I would turn over a new leaf, and marry. Dan, what say you to my taking Mrs. Dorothy Sarsdale for a wife?"</p> 
               <p>"Why thin, is it out o' your sinses you are to be thinkin o' takin' that piece of ould carrion, who, for all she dhrives her four glandered bastes, an' has plinty o' cash, is as cross as the cats, an' as tough as a gad, an' as grey as a badger. Why thin, may I be fairly hanged, if a princ ss, or a King's<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8325-00000015"/> daughter, or even the Queen o' Shaaba, would be the laste taste in life too good for you!

Oh thundher an' ounds! it's as thrue as a--"</p> 
               <p>The purposed asseveration was cut short by the nasal twang of Piping Phil's well-known bagpipes, which suddenly burst on the ears of the eloquent Dan, and struck up an air so invigorating as to set him instinctively jigging round the room, while with stentorian lungs he roared out the apposite and poetical distich of <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Will ye, will ye marry me, my dear Alley Croker?</l> 
                        <l>Will ye, will ye marry <emph>me,</emph> my dear Alley Crooker?"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Connell and his master entertained opinions directly opposed to those which the immortal Shakspeare has expressed respecting the harmony of the bagpipes: therefore, when the drone of that euphonical instrument acted on their auricular nerves, Dan, having first manifested his delight in the manner already described, next rushed to the window, the sash of which he dashed up, while, uttering a whoop of joy, he hallooed forth-"Och! thin, how is every bit o' you, Phil? an' 'tis welcome ye are as the flowers in May to ould Quolagh!-Come along you ould vagabone! see, here's the Masther standin' as plain as a pikestaff <emph>forenent</emph> your blind eyes, wid his fist in his pocket, jist waitin' to chuck out a nate thirteen,-Oh don't lose your luck, my boy!"</p> 
               <p>A loud squeak, like that of a dying swine, here abruptly terminated the execution of Alley Croker; while "the <emph>Professor</emph>" tightly grasping his pipes beneath his arm, and led by a shaggy black terrier, advanced rapidly along one of the well-trodden paths, and, approaching the window, with low bow he accosted his Chief with the usual salutation f-"God save your Honour this blessed mornin'! an' long life an' a happy death to you, an' that's what I pray, wid all my veins!"</p> 
               <p>"Thank you-thank you, Phil-I'm glad to see you again'-Here, will you takes a glass?" said The O'Sullivan, filling out a bumper of whiskey.</p> 
               <p>"Will a duck swim, agrah?" asked the minstrel, and tossing off the exhilerating beverage, he quaffed it, before, to use Dan's comment, "a body could say Jack Robinson!"</p> 
               <p>"Betther stuff niver wetted my whistle nor that! But it riz up the cockles o' my heart!" cried the piper, while with one hand he deliberately wiped his reeking lips, and with the other laid down the empty goblet. "An' now will I strike up a Planxty."</p> 
               <p>"By and bye, we'll trouble you, Phil; put first, pray let me hear where you have been, and what has kept you so long away?" returned The O'Sullivan.</p> 
               <p>"Is it where I've been, Sir? Och! thin far enough, dear knows! Shure, wasn't I at the fair o' Ballinasloe, an' afther that at the 'sizes o' Cork? an' didn't I handle my pipes at tin pattherns, let alone one at Blarney? an' wasn't I in at Tim Mahony's death; an' a beautiful corpse he made I an' dacently scroodged; we wor at his wake an' berrin'. Och! Yarrow thin! that minds me of a bit of paper I have for your Honour, from Masther Will, that he gim me at Cork, tin days ago; an' shure, if Ould Nick didnt charm it away to make ducks an' drakes of, I have it somewhere or order, as safe as a thief in a mill!" cried the Hibernian Mercury, as he fumbled in, and dragged out of a leather pouch, which formed a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pendant</foreign> to his bagpipes, a heterogeneous mass of nondescript articles, among which figured a broken <foreign xml:lang="GAI">doodeen</foreign> stuffed with tobacco, Shane Flaherty's "ounce o' green tay," divers filthy rags of frieze, linen, leather, and flannel; some cold potatoes, a pair of new brogues, and grey worsted stockings, dried dillisk, salted <foreign xml:lang="GAI">orubeens</foreign> and a huge black bottle half filled with <foreign xml:lang="GAI">potheen.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>While turning our these precious relics, Phil cautiously <emph>felt,</emph>
                  <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8325-00000016"/> and the black terrier assiduously <emph>nosed,</emph> each savoury <foreign xml:lang="FRA">morceau;</foreign> the latter actuated by his epicurean propensities, the former by an anxious desire to find "Masther Will's" important letter.</p> 
               <p>"Go to the devil!" exclaimed The O'Sullivan stamping with rage, as the motley contents of Phil's leathern pouch passed in review without discovering the wished-for epistle-"go to the devil!"</p> 
               <p>"Wisha thin," tis a mortual long journey you're sendin' me, Sir! an' shure you wouldn't refuse to gim me somethin' to pay my thravellin' expinces?" cried the piper, stopping his search for the moment, and with a sort of triumphant laugh turning round a face so radiant with fun that even its sightless eyes seemed lit with the spirit of glee. The O'Sullivan's features blackened with passion, but before he could vent it in words, Dan Council with the agility of a harlequin leaped through the open window, and twitching Phil's sleeve, anxiously whispered,-"Asy, asy, man!-mind your hits! shure you're as blind as a piper in airnest, an' as dull as a hog, or you'd see that the Masther's in one of his <foreign xml:lang="GAI">tantarararas!</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>"Hurra! Hurra!-here it is! cut an' dhry for his Honour!-blessed Virgin be praised!" cried the delighted Phil, who at this auspicious moment found the object of his search jammed in between two of the salted <foreign xml:lang="GAI">crubeens,</foreign> one of which the black terrier bore triumphantly off, while his master, disengaging the greasy epistle that still stuck to the other, rubbed it against his knees, then raised it to his nostrils, and smelt it keenly; after which, Phil, with his wonted air of comic hardihood, exclaimed,-"Och! by my sowl 'tis as sweet as a curd an' as sound as a trout;-I'll gim by <emph>Devy</emph> o' that! so I needn't bestow any <foreign xml:lang="GAI">cooram</foreign> (care) upon it-Here, your Honour;-here's Masther Will's bit of a letther, as safe as if it comed in the Royal Diligence from Cork," he added, extending the filthy paper towards the spot where The O'Sullivan stood.</p> 
               <p>"Why thin there's a <foreign xml:lang="GAI">polthoque,</foreign> an' 'tis well you desarve it!" cried Dan Connell, as he jestingly bestowed a hearty blow on the piper's shoulder, in the act of doing which he contrived to whisper in his ear,-"Hould your jaw, and be off to the kitchin, an' the Divil fly wid you, Phil!-don't you see, man, the Masther's as mad as blazes?"</p> 
               <p>"You good for nothing blind buzzard!" roared Murty Oge, "I'll--"</p> 
               <p>"Ah thin, Masther dear, shure you wouldn't mind what that maaly-mouthed fool of a piper does?" cried Dan, as having pushed off the repudiated musician to a distance of some yards he leaped back to his former station, and, once more slamming down the window, delivered, as a peace offering, the momentous latter, which thus at length reached its final destination.</p> 
               <p>The Chieftain tore the paper open, and rapidly glancing his eye over it he vociferated in a voice of thunder-</p> 
               <p>"The devil's in the fellow! What do you think of this, Dan? The captain, instead of going, as I ordered him, to France, has dared to sail for the Highlands of Scotland! Och! The impudent rascal! the obstinate mule! if I don't make him pay for his pranks may I be--!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh the schaaming gomal!-Why thin what in the world tuck him off to that beggarly Scotland?" asked Dan in a tone of mingled surprise and vexation.</p> 
               <p>"He pretends," replied The O'Sullivan, with an evident effort endeavoring to bridle his anger, "that, on arriving at Cork, he received private instructions from Prince Charles Edward to sail instantly for the North, there, in defiance of my prohibation, to negotiate with the Highland elans who, notwithstanding their recent defeats, are still attached to the interests of the Stuarts, and the fellow has the impudence to say that he considers his political schemes to be sounder than mine."</p> 
               <p>"Tache his granny to suck eggs!" rejoined Connell, indignantly;-"was ever the like hard of since Adam was a little boy? By the hoky! thin, Sir, we'll larn him betther manners in father, or my name isn't Dan."</p> 
               <p>"And what do you think we ought to do?" asked Murty Oge, who began to regain a degree of composure.</p> 
               <p>"To my notion, Sir, we ought to be off for France, in the crack of a fan; an' thin, if I'm not out in my reck'nin', your Honour ill put the rascal in a mortual pucker, an' 'ill give<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8325-00000017"/> him as good as he brought, an' 'ill play the mischief wid all his schaames an' make him shake in his shoes, whin you see Colonel Lally, an the rest o' the King James's thrue pathriots in Paris, an' discover wid 'em all consarnin' the rights o' the counthry, like a great pollytician, an' share sorra betther could be found nor yoursef from Cape Clear to the Causeway!" cried Dan.</p> 
               <p>"Before this cursed letter came," said The O'Sullivan, crushing the paper he held, "I intended to sail for France, for I strongly suspect that our enemy. Lord Ogilvie, is in pursuit of me."</p> 
               <p>"Oh tundher an' turf! if that be all, I'll ingage we'll throw dust in his eyes-an' in spite o' the parlimint carry our <emph>pint,</emph> an' small blame to us, widout, wid, or by your lave;" vehemently answered Connell.</p> 
               <p>"That's easier said than done," returned The O'Sullivan, with much anxiety of manner.</p> 
               <p>"Not a bit of it!-nothing in life more asy;-shure we've only to putt a bould face on the matther, an' make up a cock-an'-a-bull story, an' by that same we'll desarve the <hi rend="i"/>Sansenachs, an' give 'em no pace till they're fairly bothered."</p> 
               <p>"Well, now, Dan, go, and tell Father Syl that he must accompany us:-'t will give a better-color to the whole affair; besides, he is in our secret about you know <emph>who,</emph> and if we have any difficulty in forcing her to take the veil, a priest may be found convenient. Father Syl, moreover, being the only person who knows <emph>the</emph> affair, may--"</p> 
               <p>"Why thin, keep your tongue widin your teeth, an' God bless you, Sir!" interrupted Dan, forcibly applying his hand against his master's lips; "faix, you'll play the <foreign xml:lang="GAI">dunnus</foreign> (mischief) wid us all if you don't take care. An' now, your Honor," he added, withdrawing the brawny impediment by which he had attempted to restrain Murty Oge's unruly member; "I'll go, shure enough, widout cracking cry till I find Father Syl, an' 'ill tell him to be ready to sail wid your honor at screech o' day, in the hooker to morrow, for shure it's in it we must go, since Captain Will, bad luck to him I has the pride o' the saas, our own darlint Brigantine, all to himse'f."</p> 
                
               <p>"Do, do;-and Dan, don't forget to set the sham story of our pilgrimage to the Skeligs afloat, so that it may reach all ears immediately."</p> 
               <p>"As shure as a gun I'll do that same, an' I'll be bail I'm the lad that 'ill settle everything quite to your Honor's satisfaction."</p> 
               <p>"Very well-be off, then; but Dan, take care to see that the hooker's in proper trim, all right and tight for the trip, and manned my brave Buccaneers. And, do you hear?" added. The O'Sullivan in an authoritative voice, as Connell was in the act of departing to make necessary preparations, "let me have no nonsensical delay, like the one you remember occurred when we missed a capital wind for clearing the bay, by waiting for you, Sir, to finish your breakfast."</p> 
               <p>"Och, botheration! that's all i' my eye. An' now, Master dear, lave off your <foreign xml:lang="GAI">haggin,</foreign> (scolding) an' I warrant I'll guard agin sich another misfortin, for I'll eat my breakfast to night, an' thin I'll have no delay in the mornin', but 'I be ready at cockcrow to folly your honor if you wint to the Divil himse'f."</p> 
               <p>With this magnanimous resolution, Dan Connell scampered off in search of Father Syl, leaving the hold Captain Sullivan to digest his future plans, and to ruminate on the probable success of his intended enterprise.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE LOVERS.</head> 
               <p>IT was on a soft, delicious day when the sky was filled with brightness, the woods with melody, and the earth with odour, that Murty Oge O'Sullivan arrived at that part of the coast of Brittany on which St. Brieux is situated.</p> 
               <p>Leaving his Cutter in the care of the most skilful of his seamen. The O'Sullivan landed, and soon reached a secluded pathway that he well remembered. This narrow road led to a small shrubbery to which a private gate gave access. The Chieftain was accompanied by six men armed with pistols<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8325-00000018"/> carefully concealed beneath the blue frieze jackets which they wore. The gate was a-jar, and the party entered unobserved, and in profound silence. At the distance of a few paces was a small summerhouse. Towards this spot The O'Sullivan and his followers directed their steps, and at the whispered command of their master the latter hid themselves under the shelter of the building, there to await his further orders. The Chief then proceeded alone, with a quiet, wary tread, up a narrow walk, that led to a very high palisade, which, thickly covered with evergreens and wild roses, surrounded a flower-garden belonging to a picturesque cottage that stood on a grassy sward at the further end of it. This strikingly-pretty though small retreat was within a mile of St. Brieux, and a short distance from the village of Treguier, which lay further to the west on the coast of Bretagne. A magnificent range of woods, that skirted the fine domain of the Chateau de Tullibar-dine, formed a beautiful screen of verdure in the distance, and presented a noble back-ground to the sloping green land on which, much nearer the sea, the <foreign xml:lang="GAI">cottage orne</foreign> was erected.</p> 
               <p>Our Irish adventurer perceived that to gain the entrance to the garden it would be necessary to wind his way for some distance outside the palisade, and with an anxious countenance he was cautiously doing so, when a murmuring of voices tell on his ear, which induced him to stop and listen.</p> 
               <p>Though evening was nigh, the sun still shone brightly in the heavens-all around was balm and beauty. The light air stole fragrance from a thousand flowers-the birds sand gaily on the trees, and Nature, clothed in her variegated robe, gladdened the earth and skies with her smile. Murty Oge paused, but not to enjoy the scene or season, for both were unheeded by the anxious listener, as he held his breath in order to catch the words of the speakers, whose young voices, mixed with the melody of evening sounds, came wafted like music on the breeze towards him.</p> 
               <p>At some distance from the spot where he stood, The O'Sullivan perceived a small opening in the branches of the shrubs that entwined the lofty palisade. He crept to this vista, and peeping through it beheld a picture, which, though only presenting a sweet home view, seemed to rivet his attention with the power of a spell.</p> 
               <p>The speakers, whose tones had reached The Chieftain's ears, and who were now quite close to him, were a young man (Lord Ogilvie) and the beautiful girl who has been already named to the reader as Eva Dillon. They were seated on a low rustic bench, under a fine old ash tree, that grew in the midst of a small <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parterre,</foreign> gay with flowers and radiant with sunshine. A guitar, which seemed to have been thrown idly on the grass, lay at their feet. The broad ocean gleamed in the perspective of the landscape wrapped into perfect calm beneath a brilliant sky.</p> 
               <p>A little to one side on the smooth green sward which slanted from the cottage-door, and busily employed at a spinning-wheel that moved with almost magical rapidity, sat Norah, the nurse and almost maternal attendant and faithfully-devoted friend of Eva Dillon.</p> 
               <p>The attitude of Eva Dillon, whose head fondly rested on the shoulder of Lord Ogilvie while his arm encircled her waist, was not necessary to reveal to Murty Oge that the parties he observed were lovers. The deep soft tones, which, as they spoke, seemed to issue from their souls-all tenderness and trust-would have betrayed that truth, unsupported by any other evidence. Great as were the anger and surprise of The O'Sullivan at a discovery so unexpected, those feelings yielded for a few moments to the astonished admiration with which he gazed upon the maiden beauty of Eva Dillon.</p> 
               <p>She had just reached that bright period of existence when the first gladness of extreme youth merges into the touching grace and bloom of womanhood. The innocent fondness that filled her heart reposed on her face like sunshine, and imparted a share of its own essence to all who looked upon and loved her. The rich glance of her deep blue eye, curtained by dark lashes, gave forth every feeling of her soul; and a profusion of golden ringlets added their own portion of interest to the arched and stainless brow round which they flowed in the wildness of infantine simplicity. Her forehead, neck, and bosom were so fair and polished, that it seemed as it a breath<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8325-00000019"/> would mar their purity; but the warm blood of her cheek never slept, and in its perpetual changes produced the most vivid and striking effects. A small and rather prominent chin gave piquancy to her rich red lips, which, though generally girt with smiles, could languish into softness that was even more bewitching. Her figure was light, flexible, and exquisitely-rounded; in its movements realizing all the natural grace which peculiarly belongs to the unstudied attitudes of childhood. Such was Eva Dillon.</p> 
               <p>Lost in amazement at the alteration which a few years had produced in her appearance. The O'Sullivan let several moments pass before he collected himself sufficiently to listen to her words with the attention which the sudden earnestness of his countenance seemed to indicate that they deserved. At the instant when with recovered self-possession our spy became all ear, he heard Lord Ogilvie exclaim, as he fervently pressed the hand of Eva between both his own,-</p> 
               <p>"When I speak of our engagement, dear one, you are always so scrupulous-so <emph>very</emph> apprehensive."</p> 
               <p>"If I am, it is for <emph>you,</emph>" replied the blushing girl in accents of undisguised but modest tenderness.</p> 
               <p>"My sweet, my generous friend, I know it!" replied Ogilvie, in great emotion; "but surely you allow an over-wrought refinement of feeling to interfere with happiness, when you conjure up that fancied obstacle to our immediate union which I have so often vainly tried to vanquish-I mean the mystery of your birth."</p> 
               <p>"Call it not fanciful!" said Eva Dillon, raising her tearful eyes with timid fondness to his face. The next instant fixing them upon the ground, she added, in a soft tremulous voice, "Ogilvie, you know full well how very precious is your love to me, and that if it were possible to fulfil our engagement with the speed which you desire, you would find me faithful-kind-devoted-but-Nay! Nay, you <emph>must</emph> listen to me calmly-indeed you must!" continued the agitated girl, attempting to assume a sportive air, as, gently disengaging herself from the arm which with protecting tenderness was thrown round her, she shook back her golden hair, and, holding up her finger, said, in a tone of mock reproach,-</p> 
               <p>"What, my Lord! am I to have no womanly prerogative-no power to breathe out airy hopes and quell them at my pleasure? Have I no right to-"</p> 
               <p>"My own adored one!"-interrupted her lover, with a depth of feeling which at once put all her graceful playfulness to flight, "I would speak seriously, for my heart is full."</p> 
               <p>"And so is mine!" ejaculated Eva Dillon, bursting into tears; but with a smile which sparkled through them she instantly controlled her powerful emotion by as powerful an effort, and said, with gentle earnestness, "Friend, of my heart! I should ill deserve the love you bear me if I allowed the noble kindness of your nature to lead you into error. <emph>Your</emph> wife must be above suspicion. I hope most fervently that I shall yet discover <emph>who</emph> I am, and what have been the circumstances which led to my peculiar situation. If the explanation be such as I could wish-then, then, my generous Ogilvie!"-</p> 
               <p>Whatever Eva Dillon added was uttered in a voice so low and tremulous as to be inaudible to the anxious Chief, but the reply of her lover gave its purport. He said,-</p> 
               <p>"Precious will be the hour that makes you mine, my best beloved! I have much to thank you for, and I will prove my gratitude by consenting to postpone the completion of my fondest hopes. Yet tell me, dearest, is not the idea of ever being able to remove the objection which you raise to our immediate union little better than an idle dream?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not think so. Nurse Norah says that when Smith's servant brought the last remittance, he assured her that this year we should see his Master-that mysterious man who knows my history, and directs my fate! When he was here ten years ago, I was young and thoughtless, and merry as the little bird that sings upon that tree. During my blessed childhood. I never had a care, for I was happy, and I thought the world so too, and knew not there was such a thing as sorrow upon earth, or that any one could be miserable while the sky was blue and the sun bright. The death of the<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8325-00000020"/> Marquis of Tullibardine first awoke me from this dream of bliss. I felt his loss acutely, for he was always kind to me as if I were his child; and oh! it was so sad that he should die away from all he loved-a prisoner, too! I saw and sympathized in the deep affliction of his widow, and thus I learned the sad reality of grief!-Such knowledge sobered the natural joyousness of my feelings, and revealed their depths;-they strengthened with my strength, and then as time wore on I loved!-Ogilvie! how fervently I then prayed and longed to know <emph>who</emph> were my parents! though from infancy I met with fond devotion from my Nurse and all a mother's tenderness from Lady Tullibardine. Whenever Smith arrives, I suppose I may acknowledge her surpassing kindness; for even if he be the spy upon the Jacobites we feared his power to injure is now circumscribed. Death has placed Lord Tullibardine far beyond the power of man, and I trust our Prince is in equal safety from his foes. The dread of the political conduct of his allies being watched and reported by my guardian (were his attention once directed to it) was the only cause which made the Marchioness enjoin us to conceal the comfort she diffused around my humble home, and the invaluable education she bestowed on me."</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan started. The expression of his eye and the gloom which accumulated round his brow marked the astonishment and displeasure with which he heard the last words of the speaker; but, curbing his feelings, our eaves-dropper once more listened with breathless attention.</p> 
               <p>Eva Dillon had paused, but her silence was short, for in the next instant, while blushes clothed her face and neck, she softly said:-</p> 
               <p>"Since we have loved, my anxiety about my birth has been a source of painful, constant thought; and when my guardian comes, I will-I <emph>must</emph> require him to tell me <emph>all.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Ogilvie gazed on Eva with fervent tenderness, and, murmuring forth his thanks and blessings, tried to soothe her spirits by talking of a brilliant future, which should more than repay the agitations of the past.</p> 
               <p>The admiring Ogilvie pressed the hand of Eva in silent sympathy, and said, after a short pause, "When this Smith arrives, I must see and speak to him, and whoever are the agents that control your fate, I will encounter them. I would have done this long ago, had I but known where to find your Guardian. Nurse! Nurse!" continued Lord Ogilvie, raising his voice in pretended anger, "I cannot forgive your obstinate silence on every subject which concerns that man."</p> 
               <p>At this apostrophe, Norah stopped her wheel, and, looking round upon the lovers with maternal kindness, a smile played over her features, which seemed to say that she only waited for permission to take an earnest part in the dialogue.</p> 
               <p>"Norah, I cannot forgive your silence about this Smith, for I am certain you could tell us many things concerning him.-Come, Norah, be a good creature, and answer me at last this question:-Is he related to your precious nursling?"</p> 
               <p>Lord Ogilvie made this inquiry with an anxiety he vainly strove to hide beneath a playfulness that was assumed.</p> 
               <p>After a moment's pause, during which every disposition to mirth had vanished from Norah, she said in a sharp quick tone of voice-</p> 
               <p>"Will your Lordship niver rest asy about that same bizziness? I tell yees both now, as I tould yees many a time, I'd dhrop down stone dead at your feet-so I would-afore I'd be guilty o' the burnin' sin an' scandal iv answerin' that quistion, whin nearly sixteen years ago I kissed <emph>the book,</emph> and swore by the vartue o' my oath not to do so; an' also to bring up the darlint before me as a thrue Roman."</p> 
               <p>"Here is my excuse, Norah, for having asked a question which, perhaps, was wrong; good creature, say that you forgive me."</p> 
               <p>"Wirra! wirra! thin 'tis your Lordship's the coaxin' broth iv a boy!" replied Norah, shaking her head, and clasping her hands round her knees, as her eyes were raised with affectionate vivacity to Ogilvie's.</p> 
               <p>The next instant they rested on Eva's young and innocent beauty, which, glowed in the softened radiance of the setting sun.</p> 
               <p>Eva sought and found comfort in her lover's glance of<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8325-00000021"/> perfect sympathy, and though her face was mournful, it beamed with sweet tenderness while she said:-</p> 
               <p>"Though Norah only saw my Mother once, and on her death-bed, yet how vividly she seems to recollect her person! Her name, I am convinced, she does not know."</p> 
               <p>"She has often said so, and I believe her," rejoined Ogilvie, "for Nurse's veracity is quite remarkable."</p> 
               <p>"I sometimes dread that Smith may prove <emph>my father,</emph>" said Eva in a shuddering voice. "'Tis strange, considering how imperfect is my recollection of the man, that I should so dislike and fear him."</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan gave an involuntary start of displeasure, and the rustling of the leaves his act occasioned made Eva spring up, and look about with some alarm, as she said,-</p> 
               <p>"Whence is that noise? Did you not hear it, dearest?"</p> 
               <p>"I heard nothing but your own melodious voice, which makes my heart's best music," replied Ogilvie.</p> 
               <p>When Ogilvie ceased speaking Eve sat for an instant lost in silent thought. Some unutterable feeling seemed to have taken possession of her soul, and suddenly she wept!</p> 
               <p>"Eva I beloved of my heart! speak;-say why this painful emotion?" cried the alarmed lover, kissing away the tears that glittered down her cheek.</p> 
               <p>"Do look brightly beautiful again, or else good Nurse will think we have been quarrelling! for see here she comes laden with mufflings to guard you from the evening air!" he added, pointing to Norah, who at that instant re-appeared, advancing from the cottage, with a close bonnet and a warm shawl. The moment she reached the lovers, she insisted that Eva should invest herself in both; when this was done, the Nurse, dropping her best courtesy, presented a note to Lord Ogilvie, which a servant had just brought. He glanced rapidl over the contents, and, turning to Eva, pressed her hand, as in altered voice he said,-</p> 
               <p>"This is from Prince Charles. I must go to Paris instantly, but will return as soon as possible. The moment I come back shall bring me to your feet."</p> 
               <p>Eva started and changed color, as in broken accents she murmured in strong and deep emotion,-"Oh, Ogilvie! said I not truly, that the strange thrill which shot through my heart predicted evil was at hand?"</p> 
               <p>Every fibre of the lover's heart felt this appeal. Ogilvie said in a voice of tremulous emotion, "Beloved one! do not make me wretched by giving way to vague and groundless terrors; remember how soon-how very soon, we two shall meet again; till then, may God protect and bless you!" Both murmured again and again a fond farewell. Then, not daring to trust himself to stay another moment, Ogilvie gently replaced the trembling Eva on her garden-seat and turning to Norah, said hastily, and in a broken voice, "Kind Nurse, goodbye! I need not say, be careful of the dear one!" he then hurried from the garden and was gone!</p> 
               <p>Eva now sobbed aloud, and leaning back upon the rustic bench, covered her face to hide its agitation. Norah placing herself on a large stone near her precious charge.</p> 
               <p>Uninterrupted by a word, a considerable time passed thus, in solemn silence.</p> 
               <p>At length, Eva sadly smiled through her tears on the affectionate Norah.</p> 
               <p>Eva's lips parted as if about to speak, and she had thrown her hand caressingly around her Nurse's neck, when suddenly a scream of terror burst from the affrighted girl.</p> 
               <p>Springing to her feet she flung one arm round Norah, who had also started up, and pointed the other towards a group of men who gained her side the following moment. We need scarcely say they were the Irish Buccaneers of Murty Oge O'Sullivan.</p> 
               <p>"Remove these women!" said the Pirate Chieftain in a firm but stifled voice.</p> 
               <p>His followers seized their prey in silence, and resisting equally the convulsed earnestness with which Eva clung for safety round her Nurse, and the clamorous appeals the latter made, the Buccaneers separated our affrighted heroine from the weak stay which she had chosen.</p> 
               <p>Taking <unclear>effectual</unclear> means to prevent any more outcries, the men followed the lead of their stern commander, and bore<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8325-00000022"/> their prisoners forward so successfully, that soon, and without discovery, the objects of this strange arrest where on board. The O'Sullivan's ship, which lay in the adjacent bay. Without awaiting the appearance of the dawn, the Cutter stood out boldly from the land, and, crowding all sail before the wind, dashed with prodigious swiftness through the glittering foam of the broad sea.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">PERILOUS MOMENT.</head> 
               <p>"THE curse o' Cromwell light on what keeps the Masther cooling his heels!"</p> 
               <p>"Here, comfort your heart with <emph>that,</emph>" answered Syl, moving a brimful glass across the small round table, at the other side of which his companion was seated. "But," he added, when, after having dashed inwards the contents of his own tumbler, he rubbed his eyes, as if to open them to the meaning of Connell's address, "Make your mind asy, man; sure he wouldn't put a dirty lie any way; an' didn't he tell me in your presence all about what the King said and promised in his own closet? and, between ourselves, it isn't a bad offer he made."</p> 
               <p>Syl shook his head, and his small twinkling eyes grew unusually serious under his beetle brows, as he said-</p> 
               <p>"I tell you what, Dan, my mind quakes like a duck in thunder about this same quare marriage that you an' his Honour (more fool he!) have settled slap-dash to take place at the Skeligs. But I have promised to tack 'em together; and may my spic an' span vestments be torn to babby-rags if I go back o' my word."</p>

               <p>"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah to your toast!"-vociferated Syl giving an astounding blow to the table with one hand, and with the other raising his glass to his mouth; a proceeding which banished his previous qualms, and made him (to use the words of the old song.) <q>

               <p>"Och, thin from head to fut you're the man in the gap, whin, your heart is once ased with a dhrop o' the crathur," cried Dan Connell.</p> 
               <p>"Murther an' oons! 'tis six o'clock by my gowld repaather, an' the Masther thinks to be here wi Miss Eva and Norah at eight," cried Dan Connell, starting from the table as he consulted his watch, and held it up to Syl in warning of the cruel flight of time.</p> 
               <p>Connell then paid the reckoning, and left the inn.</p> 
               <p>The solitude of the wild coast on which Syl and his companion had emerged appeared doubly cool and tranquil in comparison with the heated atmosphere of the little room which they had left. A few fishermen were either spreading their nets on the rocks or furling the sails of their boats: but they pursued their employment so quietly that not a voice was heard along the nearly unfrequented shore. The O'Sullivan's Cutter was moored at some distance; and as the tide rapidly increased in fullness, the heavings of the vessel gradually diminished, until at length she rested on the broad waters almost without motion. The entire prospect was peaceful in the extreme.</p> 
               <p>Dan Connell first broke the silence,-"About sixteen years ago, I landed my Shisther Norah an' the sweet babby at her breast near this self-same place. An' now, jist to think o' the<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8325-00000023"/> bit iv a babby bein' grown into a clever, likely girl as ever you set your two good-looking eyes upon; an' to see how we're goin' to kidnap her agin to make her the Lady o' Ross Mac Owen!-An', Och! it's the hoight o' surprise 'ill be Miss Eva's when she finds the purtinded Captain Smith thransmogriphied into the Earl of Bearhaven! An betwixt our two sels, I thought we would niver, by hook or by crook, have got Norah (she's a rock o' sinse!) to give ear to the schame o' forgin' a name for his Honor; which, to be sure, he had as much right to as the man in the moon! An' deed an' conscions, now, the only manes that brought Norah to consint was by what we did, the makin' a fool iv her intirely, in ladin' her to be sure that Miss Eva was his Honour's own bred an' born nat'rel daughther. Faix, I could hardly keep my countenance whin, on the head o' that bouncing lie, we made Norah swear the big oath not to let the cat out of the bag, but, in spite o' the varsal world niver to let on to Miss Eva <emph>who</emph> her own fader was, but to keep her out o' hurt or harm, an' to lade her up as a right thrue Roman, till we comed back to Bretagne; and that we promised to do about this very time. An', rest our bowls! how surprised my poor Shisther 'ill be whin I slap palms wid her, and dhrop a word in her ear o' the wedding we'll have, plaze the Pigs, at the Skeligs. Och! may I niver wear a hempen cravat if sich curous wondhers wouldn't kill the cow that died o' the murrain!"</p> 
               <p>"Tis strange enough, no doubt," returned Syl; "an' how long, Dan, may it be since you seen <emph>her</emph> an' Norah, for I forget?"</p> 
               <p>"Four years ago; 'twas whin I did as his Honor bid, and luck over here to my Shisther Norah a mighty purty little bit of a sum. Och! och! she's a rosebud o' beauty, that same Marlint we're spakin' of."</p> 
               <p>"I'll go bail she isn't a patch on her pet of a mother for all that!-'Tis well I remimber the day that I married, an' the right that I buried her!-Why thin, Dan, what a lucky toss up for your masther it was, that the only sowl besides our two selves, who knew of the ugly deed, should ha' gone down to Davey's locker!"</p> 
                
               <p>"Och, thin, I'd die in pace, an' a great ase' twould be to my heart, if we wor quite sure and sartain o' <emph>that;</emph> yet though so many summers are gone since we hard that same bit o' good news, it often crasses my mind that some how or oder it mightn't be thrue; an' I'd sooner see myself in my coffin nor that! Howsomedever whin once the Masther makes <emph>her</emph> his rib,-an' all her fine lands his own by raison of his being her hubby, why a fig for the law."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Dan, to my notion, I'd rather have pinned her snug in a Convent, so I would, as we intended!"</p> 
               <p>"Arrah! shure that close-fisted stiggaun of a Louis wouldn't give us no time for any such thing!-Och, don't be fautin' our schames an' puttin' your larnin' upon me, as if I was out-an' out a clare an clane <emph>innocent.</emph> It's all settled now; so what good to be talkin'?"</p> 
               <p>As Dan uttered those words, he clambered up the side of a high jutting rock, having reached the summit of which, he drew a telescope from his pocket, and after an earnest scrutiny through it, he descried the well-known Cutter of The O'Sullivan, looking like a spectre ship in the distance, and swiftly advancing from St. Brieux to the little haven of Treguier.</p> 
               <p>The sea had been calm as an untroubled lake, when, after the capture of our heroine, Murty the Rover, sailed with his companions along its surface, and for some hours succeeding their embarcation the vessel rode quietly across the placid waters.</p> 
               <p>The moment it reached Treguier, a boat was lowered, which glided swiftly to the point where Syl and Dan Connell were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the cutter.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan enjoined the strictest silence.</p> 
               <p>Dan Connell advanced to his Master, who stood at the other end of the vessel.</p> 
               <p>"Long life to my Lord of Bearhaven! an' 'tis long the time has seemed to your own born foster brother since his two eyes wor blest wid a sight o' you. Is all safe, Masther agrah?-An' where are the women?"</p> 
               <p>"In the small cabin below, confound them! 'tis trouble enough they've given me, Dan," answered The O'Sullivan<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8325-00000024"/> "At all events I've got the <emph>rhino,</emph> Dan! That freshwater sailor, De Maurepas, cashed his uncle's order for a thousand livres without demur, and here it is!" he exclaimed, triumphantly patting the pocket of his sea-jacket.</p> 
               <p>"Ah! thin, St. Pathrick be praised!-Isn't it betther have <emph>that</emph> than all the wimen upon airth? May I make so bould as to ax your honour do <emph>she</emph> and my Sisther know, Sir, that ye intinded to take up mysef an' Syl at Treguier?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I told them so; but no more of your balderdash talk, Dan, for see we are doubling the last French headland; and if I'm not deucedly out in my reckoning, we are in for a pretty stiff gale! Hollo, boys! haul to!" he ejaculated in a loud voice, which instantly thundered forth divers other nautical and necessary orders that were instantly obeyed.</p> 
               <p>All was now activity on board the Cutter; but though everything was done which true seamanship could devise, the wind became so foul and boisterous, that The O'Sullivan, much against his inclination, was obliged to put back towards a cape that jutted far into the ocean, and to anchor off shore until the elements proved more propitious. Their turbulence continued unabated until the opening of day, when the wind suddenly became so favourable, that preparations were again made to put the ship in motion; and springing lightly over the billows, she re-commenced her course under a fresh and auspicious breeze.</p> 
               <p>During the night of our heroine's capture she had been confined with Norah to the little cabin of The O'Sullivan's ship, and within its narrow limits she had ample opportunity to indulge those reflections on the past which crowded to her mind, in addition to the consternation and alarm created by her present prospects.</p> 
               <p>Dan Connell, almost in the moment of encountering Norah-a meeting marked by indignation on her part-had abruptly told his choleric sister that The O'Sullivan was <emph>not</emph> the father of our heroine. This communication, unaccompanied by any intelligence relative to her real parentage, and associated with a hint of the unsuitable marriage meditated by Murty Oge and his confederates, struck poor Norah with horror and amaze.</p> 
               <p>In this state she had been removed, with the equally agitated Eva, to the small cabin alloted to their use. There Norah briefly communicated the astounding intelligence she had just received.</p> 
               <p>The reader will easily conjecture the dreadful nature of the feelings which such information awoke in the bosom of the unfortunate Eva Dillon; yet, even under the pressure of apprehensions that bowed her spirit to the dust, her first emotion was that of thankfulness to God at finding The O'Sullivan was <emph>not</emph> her father! The next movement of her mind led her to endeavour to assuage the fears of her faithful and afflicted nurse, who sat beside her Mistress-her face covered with her hands, and her body rocking to and fro, while deep, long moans escaped from her devoted heart.</p> 
               <p>Hitherto, Eva Dillon had never been acquainted with the extremity of actual misery. From the dawn of recollection, she had been the idol of her nurse. Lady Tullibardine, from the moment she became captivated by the lovely child whom Providence threw in her way, had shown the tenderest affection towards it; and her noble husband, as long as life was spared, had participated in that attachment.</p> 
               <p>Possessed of every endearing quality, Eva soon became so inexpressibly precious to her benefactress, that the latter could not bear her absence for any length of time; and, cherished as though she had been the Marchioness's daughter, the utmost cares were lavished on her education and comfort.</p> 
               <p>She had remained exclusively under the protection of the noble woman, and thus, grew up, the artless fondness of the happy age of infancy subsequently ripening, with maturer years, into the fervency of real affection.</p> 
               <p>Thus, from her earliest days, Eva had loved and been beloved by all around her;-those delicious days of youth, when the fancy revels, but the heart lies comparatively still.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely, however, had she reached that epoch of existence when the affections just begin to burst forth into life and happiness<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8325-00000025"/> piness, than hers were gained, in all their vernal freshness, by Lord Ogilvie, who, a few years her senior, was frequently domesticated for months at the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Chateau de Tullibardine,</foreign> where Eva Dillon was a daily guest. We need not say how fervently this attachment was reciprocated. Thus, except the natural sorrow occasioned by the intelligence of the death of Lord Tullibardine in the Tower of London, she was happy.</p> 
               <p>As she sat in the cabin considering the vast efforts she might be called upon to make, her dark, blue eyes gave forth the glow of energy, and spoke the courage of a mind prepared to combat difficulties with the heroism of endurance. It was at this critical moment that The O'Sullivan entered the cabin, accompanied by a seaman bearing refreshments, of which, with an air of authority, he requested Eva to partake. She bowed a cold acknowledgment.</p> 
               <p>A watchful scrutiny, mingled with an expression of severe determination, sat on the grim visage of Murty Oge O'Sullivan, as he stood a silent spectator of these proceedings; and the moment Eva rose from her seat to intimate that she had ended her repast, the Pirate-Chief, with startling suddenness held forth his hand and said, while an expression of surly command lowered on his knitted brow-</p> 
               <p>"Return to the deck from which a declaration of MY love affrighted you! The hour is nigh when we shall part no more."</p> 
               <p>Eva Dillon looked up, and, though her face was white as death, she fixed an eye which sparkled with the spirit of its mistress on The O'Sullivan, and said, in a tone that acted on him like a spell,-</p> 
               <p>"Lead the way, Sir!"-Then, casting an expressive glance on Norah, the next instant ascended to the deck, followed by Norah, and preceded by The O'Sullivan.</p> 
               <p>The scene which met the view of Eva Dillon riveted her whole attention.</p> 
               <p>The green Atlantic was rushing from beneath the stern of the ship, as, leaving a long glistening track behind her, she scudded swiftly towards the Skelig Rocks, which stood right a head of the vessel.</p> 
                
               <p>Day was drawing to a close, but a clear light was still abroad which distinctly showed the gigantic summits of the Great Skelig, soaring into the heavens, upwards of seven hundred feet above the sea.</p> 
               <p>The two remarkable peaks in which this stupendous cliff terminates cut blackly against the sky, and its inaccessible precipices, hung in terrific grandeur o'er the waters that rushed beneath.</p> 
               <p>While she stood at the stern of the ship, The O'Sullivan intently watched the terror-stricken girl, marking the tears which trickled slowly over her face, as her eyes were raised to the rough crags that frowned above. At this moment, as if a new impulse caused the act, she clasped her hands, and lifting them to heaven, an expression of such utter misery came over her young countenance as touched even the rude heart of The O'Sullivan.</p> 
               <p>He advanced to Eva's side and spoke in a softening tone, but his words were lost in the overpowering noise which, as the ship, with lowered sail passed under the gloomy shadows thrown from the stupendous rocks, increased into a deafening roar. The seamen of the Cutter by strenuous and skillful efforts forced the vessel rapidly through the surf, and in a few minutes she ran close to a flat spot on the south side of the Great Skelig Island, which forms the best and safest landing-place.</p> 
               <p>Rousing from his trance, The O'Sullivan, in a voice which was heard above the noises that prevailed, thundered the order that called each pirate to his station in the performance of his duty.</p> 
               <p>At his Master's command, Dan Connell seized a strong rope that lay amid the cordage, and, springing to a projection of the cliff, fastened it there, and threw the other end of it into the ship, which one of the pirates caught and held. The next instant, the chief of the Irish Buccaneers glanced his quick eye from the vessel to he rock, and by his order a strong plank was placed a little beneath, and parallel to the painter which his foster-brother held.</p> 
               <p>Passing one arm round Eva's waist, and vigorously grasp.<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8325-00000026"/> ing the rope with his other hand, The O' Sullivan safely conducted her across this temporary bridge, and placed her in safety on the first of an irregular flight of steps which, cut into the solid rock, ascended its side for upwards of a hundred and fifty feet above the level of the sea.</p> 
               <p>The excitement and anxiety of the moment added a look of savage wildness to the iron features of The O'Sullivan, as in a loud shrill voice he issued forth his orders for the management of his ship, after which, addressing our heroine, he said, coolly and sternly:-</p> 
               <p>"Here, to preserve your life, you <emph>must</emph> accept my help,"</p> 
               <p>"My Nurse!" faintly gasped the affrighted Eva, clenching the rope with one hand, and extending the other towards Norah.</p> 
               <p>"She will follow us," briefly answered The O'Sullivan.</p> 
               <p>The next moment Eva, under his guidance, was forced to ascend the rocky stairs, and the peril of doing so, requiring her whole attention, checked all further parley.</p> 
               <p>"Guide Norah up the rock!" shouted out The O'Sullivan, turning to Dan Connell; and, having darted one stern look of displeasure on the agitated Norah, he began to re-ascend it quickly.</p> 
               <p>In obedience to this peremptory order Dan carried her across the plank, and, with the assistance of the rope, helped her to mount the stony steps, the danger of which exploit alone kept down her impulse to abuse the whole ship's crew afresh. But this desire was succeeded by a sensation of sickening horror, when, accidentally raising her eyes, they rested on the point where her loved Mistress stood, still as a statue, and in fearful silence grasping the shaft of a stone cross, which, chiselled in the rudest manner, was reared as a station for prayer at the jutting crag on which Eva's form, poised as it were, and unprotected even by the rail, overhung the foaming ocean, shrouded like something apparitional amid the glittering clouds of spray which the waves dashed high into the air.</p> 
               <p>At this fearful sight, Norah uttered a despairing shriek, and her whole frame worked in such convulsed earnestness that, were it not for the iron grasp with which Dan Connell held her, they would both have been precipitated into the deep sea.</p> 
               <p>"Whisht, Norah! whist! Blood and furies, woman, don't you see she's safe?" cried Dan Connell, directing his sister's distended gaze at Eva Dillon, whose waist at this moment was again seized by The O'Sullivan as with steadiness and skill he proceeded to direct her steps up the remainder of the irregular stair, which led to a flat plain, consisting of about three acres of ground, in the middle of the rocky island.</p> 
               <p>Poor Norah, whose senses had recovered with a certainty of Eva's safety, passively surrendered herself to Dan's guidance, and, in a short time, weak, trembling, and exhausted, she set her feet on firm round, and faintly sobbing forth-"The blessed God be praised!" sank into the embrace of Eva who rushed to her devoted nurse, and strained the faithful creature to her heart.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan turned away with a grin of derision, and walked some paces distant accompanied by his <hi rend="i"/>valley de sham with whom he held a short and whispered conference. The events which succeeded it are sufficiently important to claim recital in another chapter.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE ALARM.</head> 
               <p>ON taking an eager and hasty survey of the sterile space which she had reached, Eva Dillon perceived that she was surrounded by several cells or small chapels dedicated to several Saints.</p> 
               <p>The heart of the maiden beat with a pulsation almost audible, as, seated on a fragment of rock near the arched entrance of one of those chapels, with her hand locked in Norah's and her form bent forward in an attitude of expectation, she silently watched with breathless fear the movements of The O'Sullivan<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8325-00000027"/> livan, who, having despatched Connell to the Cutter, now, with a disordered step, paced the ground alone at a short distance, apparently awaiting the return of his confidant.</p> 
               <p>The blood curdled in Eva's veins, when suddenly she saw The O'Sullivan, with a look that bespoke a mind worked by evil passions, walk towards her.</p> 
               <p>The roll of his leering eye was far more alarming and offensive to her feelings than the malignant scowl which lately glared from it; and, as Eva lifted her pious spirit in prayer for the support of Heaven, she knew how deeply she required such aid.</p> 
               <p>Her limbs shivered with an agitation that compelled her to lean on Norah's shoulder, and she recoiled involuntarily from the expression of The O'Sullivan's features, when, having reached the rock where she was seated, he seized her struggling hand, and with a sudden boldness and audacious admiration said,-</p> 
               <p>"Beautiful girl! you must forgive me if ungovernable love has led me into measures which seem harsh. The powerful attraction-the cruel necessity"-</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Stop!</emph>" cried Eva, raising her face, which until she had succeeded in conquering the violence of her feelings, had been veiled with her hand-"Stop! I desire-I <emph>command</emph> you."</p> 
               <p>The haughty curl of the lip with which she pronounced those words quivered the next instant into an expression of utter misery, and, amidst the cruel strife of feelings which the moment brought, the full quick accents of her voice merged into low and broken tones, as throwing herself breathlessly before The O'Sullivan she said with clasped hands and lifted eyes that pleaded through their tears,-</p> 
               <p>"Oh, spare and pity me! Do not-do not break the heart of the young creature who petitions for your mercy!"</p> 
               <p>The Chief was not unmoved by Eva's anguish; but mortified at the scorn and pride his lovely suppliant had shown, he knit his dark brow, and with a look very different from his previous one flung aside the hands which were upraised to him, and sternly said,-</p> 
               <p>"Time is too precious to be lest in idle words. Within that Chapel the Church's rites shall make you mine this night!-"</p> 
               <p>"My soul is strong now; ay, even in this mountain desert, for a Higher Power than yours is over me."</p> 
               <p>As those words passed Eva's lips, her whole appearance changed.</p> 
               <p>In unshaken confidence she rose and the vigor of religious trust gathering on her features, while a rich color flitted over the exquisite paleness of her cheek.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan exclaimed, while conflicting feelings shot from his gleaming eye,-</p> 
               <p>"Your better course would be to bend at once to what you can't prevent, for now"-</p> 
               <p>At this instant Norah at once recovering from the paralyzing influence of terror only to exchange it for a sharper feeling, suddenly rushed towards the Pirate-Chief and shrieked out, as she grasped his arm,-</p> 
               <p>"Murty Oge O'Sullivan, listen to my words an' thremble! If you do hurt or harum to that angel girl, may a canker ate your heart by inches while you live, an' all the curses of a bloody death be on you whin you die!"</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan's color came and went and his powerful hand shook while he flung aside the gripe of Norah, whose chest heaved up and down, as, after this access of passion, she staggered back and sank exhausted in the arms of the affrighted Eva.</p> 
               <p>No one who has not heard an <emph>Irish</emph> curse can well conceive its bitterness.</p> 
               <p>Even The O'Sullivan seemed smitten by that which Norah had vented with a hoarse vehemence that gave an awful depth to her expressions.</p> 
               <p>A superstitious feeling seized him, and for a moment he stood appalled and motionless, glaring upon Eva and her Nurse, as they sat trembling on their former resting-place; but, as the stunning effect of the unexpected imprecation passed away, The O'Sullivan, with a step of suppressed fury, turned aside, and bursting into a derisive laugh walked towards the spot on which Dan Connell and a group of Buccaneers had just appeared, dragging up the puffy figure of Syl,<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8325-00000028"/> who, scarcely recovered from the drinking bout which had hitherto left him in a state of stupefaction, now suffered himself to be hauled up the rock by a thick rope which, partly coiled about his ample waist, was vigorously pulled by the pirates who stood on the verge of the plain above.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan assisted Syl to navigate his way into the interior of the largest of the Chapels, which has two holy wells of fresh water springing in its vicinity.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>The gloom of evening was now gathering round the lonely Chapel.</p> 
               <p>In an agony of thought which neither could hide from the other, and with hearts too full for speech, Eva and her humble friend had sat a long time unmolested by the Buccaneers, who one after another had returned to the Cutter.</p> 
               <p>Dan Connell and an Irish mountaineer belonging to that tribe of daring adventurers termed <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Rapparees</foreign> were the only members of the crew now seen on the rock.</p> 
               <p>The Rapparee was a man of prodigious stature: the expression of his swarthy countenance and bold black eye told the history of the roving band among which he had lived by rapine, in conjunction with other formidable bodies of banditti, who, in the time of which we treat, were generally levied by some enterprising chief. The unshrinking valour and extraordinary physical strength of the person we describe placed him high in favour with The O'Sullivan, his fendal lord.</p> 
               <p>Hence he was employed in an affair, the particulars of which the Chieftain wished to conceal as much as possible from the main body of his followers.</p> 
               <p>For some time, Connell and his bold companion had hurried to and fro in obedience to sundry orders given by The O'Sullivan, who, with Syl, remained inside the building.</p> 
               <p>Latterly, however, all bustle had subsided, and Connell and the Rapparee, stretched on the ground at a little distance from our heroine, rested from their toil, apparently in sleep. As the shades of night approached, Eva who had watched each step and gesture of those men, saw them start from their repose and walk to the edge of the cliff. There, striking fire from a flint, they lit a large branch of a fir tree, which, prepared for a torch, had been brought with other matters from the ship.</p> 
               <p>Connell and the Rapparee, bearing his lighted torch, had entered the Chapel; and, as they closed its low-arched door, E a Dillon laid her head upon her nurse's breast in strong and helpless emotion.</p> 
               <p>Large tears fell fast from Norah's eyes while, like a mother watching over all she loves, she bent her miserable gaze on Eva.</p> 
               <p>Involuntarily she strained her closer to her heart; and as she looked upon the lovely girl, and, then upon the scene around, a desolation of feeling seized her mind too great for utterance. While each appeared to be thus occupied with a foreboding of something near and dreadful which <emph>must</emph> come to pass, their agitated faces showed that every nerve was strained to catch the slightest murmur, as if their doom hung on it.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly that boding was fulfilled; for, on the instant, the Chapel-door flew open, and The O'Sullivan daringly advanced to Eva. and, uttering a few broken and most authoritative words, bore her from the outstretched arms of her nurse into the interior of St. Michael's Chapel.</p> 
               <p>Norah tried to speak, but the accents died inarticulately on her lips, and giving a lengthened moan, that seemed to issue from her inmost soul, she made a sudden effort to rush into the Chapel. The door was instantly shut by Connell, who placed himself as sentinel outside it; and never did a more impressive picture meet the view than that which the next moment revealed.</p> 
               <p>On a coarse stone altar lay a human skull white with age, and above it hung a large rude cross, carved in wood. The gigantic Rapparee stood within a walled recess behind those objects, holding his burning brand aloft in one of those wild attitudes which seem natural to a mountaineer.</p> 
               <p>The torchlight fell like a glory over the cross and skull, and shooting far beyond them, threw a stream of radiance upon<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8325-00000029"/> Eva, who, in breathless desperation, had fallen on her knees before the altar.</p> 
               <p>Her face was pale as monumental marble; her eyes were raised in speechless agony to heaven, and her full lips compressed, as if to master her sensations.</p> 
               <p>The fierce blaze of the torch glittered over her white drapery, and on the rich tresses of dishevelled hair which fell around her shoulders like a golden veil.</p> 
               <p>Fronting her, Syl stood at the altar, with an open book in his hands, and, being opposed to the light behind him, the outline of his figure cut black against it while his features were left in indistinctness.</p> 
               <p>Those of The O'Sullivan, from his position, were given fully to the view, and they expressed an almost demoniacal resolution, when, throwing one arm round Eva, he held forth the other as a silent signal to begin the rites which were to make her his for ever!</p> 
               <p>Norah's feelings and the whole of her countenance wore such a hue as in anything living it was frightful to behold.</p> 
               <p>The rude appearance of the interior of the Chapel made the group still more impressive, and when the priest began the rite of marriage, the hollow echoes which gave back the words increased their deep solemnity.</p> 
               <p>They seemed to break the spell of terror which had rendered Eva apparently almost unconscious of the passing scene for, starting to her feet, and raising her figure to its full height, she looked firmly on the priest, and unclosed her lips; but scarcely had a word escaped them, ere a wild shriek passed through the air, which was instantly succeeded by a rushing sound of total darkness!</p> 
               <p>The torch had been extinguished, and the book struck to the earth, by the rapid sweep of a large bird that suddenly flew from its covert in the walled recess, and with a savage cry rose on its broad flapping wings, and sailed away along the middle of the Chapel.</p> 
               <p>Almost at the same instant, Connell rushed in confusedly from his watch. The opening of the door admitted a faint light, guided by which, Dan bounded to his master, and gave a hasty whisper in his ear, which seemed to act on The O'Sullivan with the power of electricity.</p> 
               <p>"The cave! the cave!" were the only words he spoke but their purport was fully comprehended; for, without a question, Connell eagerly stooped down, while The O'Sullivan drew Eva to one side, and the Rapparee pulled Norah to the other, where Syl stood crossing himself in a state of terror and perplexity.</p> 
               <p>The ground seemed to burst open to the touch of Connell, for in a moment an aperture was visible beside him.</p> 
               <p>Instantly Dan was upright on his feet, and, catching Eva in his powerful arms, he approached the edge of the trap-door he had raised, and cautiously lowered her to a broad slab of stone-some yards below it, which formed the first of a flight of steps descending to the chasm that yawned beneath.</p> 
               <p>With less care, the Rapparee sprang to the verge of the abyss with Norah.</p> 
               <p>An instant was sufficient to swing her to the spot where Eva stood; in the next, the trap-door fell above their heads, and left them in utter darkness.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE FLIGHT.</head> 
               <p>WHILE the preceding scene was enacting in the Cave, a very different one took place on another part of the Great Skelig island.</p> 
               <p>As Dan Connell stood as Sentinel outside St. Michael's Chapel, the glaring of torches had first revealed the near approach of several armed men, who, having disembarked at the opposite side of the rock, were unperceived by The O'Sullivan's sentry until he saw them rapidly scaling the heights that led to the spot on which he was stationed.</p> 
               <p>A moment was not to be lost, and at sight of a danger from which there was but one chance of escaping, Connell, as we<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8325-00000030"/> have mentioned, rushed into the Chapel, and by timely warning enabled the Chieftain to conceal his victims in the Cave and to recover his coolness, before the person's who had caused so much alarm came sufficiently close to allow him to scan their faces.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan, having given a brief order to Syl and his companions, placed himself alone upon the threshold of the Chapel-door, and fixed his eye intently on the foremost of the advancing group.</p> 
               <p>As he did so, the flash of the torch that leader held revealed the features of--Lord Ogilvie!</p> 
               <p>The man The O'Sullivan hated stood before him, yet though, at the unexpected sight, his breath came short and thick, he still retained his self-command, which-as he looked upon his Lordship's men, and remembered the provoking absence of his brave Buccaneers who had sailed in the Cutter-he felt was indispensable.</p> 
               <p>"What <emph>can</emph> have led my Lord Ogilvie to cruise in such a latitude as this?"</p> 
               <p>"I am here, Sir, on no other grounds than those of strong suspicion: I have reason to suppose you accessory to the sudden disappearance of Miss Dillon from the coast of Brittany, and am come to discover her."</p> 
               <p>"There is one great obstacle to that," said Murty Oge, after a pause; "where all is plain sailing, shore-work is unnecessary. I can give you no intelligence about the lady you have named. I am, here with my Confessor and some favourite Clansmen to perform a pilgrimage to the Eagle's Nest. This chapel is our first station, and here," added The O Sullivan, throwing the door more widely open, "you may see my only companions."</p> 
               <p>The quick eyes of Lord Ogilvie glanced over the figures of Syl, the Rapparee, and Dan Connell.</p> 
               <p>The struggled with himself was strong in the bosom of our hero; and having paused a moment, he said,-</p> 
               <p>"I wish not to intrude upon your devotions. "I only want one question answered-Where is Eva Dillon?"</p> 
                
               <p>"What! is not <emph>my</emph> word sufficient? and have I not told your Lordship that I cannot answer that inquiry?" returned the Pirate-Chieftain, proudly, while anger struggled with dissimulation in his eye; "but perhaps the fair cargo you seek, my Lord, is stowed among these rocks, and a keen look-out may find it. Connell!" suddenly cried The O'Sullivan, with emphasis and sarcasm, "come and play jackal to my Lord Ogilvie, in search of a prize."</p> 
               <p>Ogilvie, who, acting merely on suspicion, and without any data beyond a vague rumour to guide his actions, felt how difficult a part he had undertaken to perform. Then turning to Murty Oge, he said, with a fixed determination in his looks-</p> 
               <p>"Sir, if you deal falsely with me, you will take the consequences. At day break I and my trusty men will search through every cranny of these rocks, and, if Miss Dillon be among them, she will surely be discovered. Sir, you will not be surprised to learn my determination to confine you and your followers within this Chapel for the night;-I and my men will be your body-guard outside," added Lord Ogilvie.</p> 
               <p>"Your lordship's consideration and forbearance are extraordinary," returned Murty Oge, in a scoffing tone, and turning ghastly with rage; "but this-"</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan had laid his hand upon his cutlass, and the unblenching courage which formed a contrast to his many vices was on the point of urging him, despite of quadrupled numbers, to attack his foes, when Connell adroitly arrested his master's arm, and, contriving to glare a furtive glance of deepest meaning on The O'Sullivan, he stepped before him, and confronting Lord Ogilvie said:-</p> 
               <p>"Now to your duty, and lave us to ours, till the shine o' the morning."</p> 
               <p>Whilst Connell spoke, he held the Chapel-door, and, as he uttered the last words, he contrived to drag his master inside and to slam it on both, before The O'Sullivan was aware of his intent. The next instant the door was barricaded on the exterior, by order of Lord Ogilvie, who, not wishing to proceed to extremities until he had clearer proof of The O'Sullivan's<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8325-00000031"/> van's guilt, was content with a temporary imprisonment of the Irish Buccaneers.</p> 
               <p>Revolving a thousand agitating thoughts, our hero, with arms folded across his chest, paced up and down before St. Michael's chapel, impatiently awaiting the morning's light to aid his future proceedings.</p> 
               <p>His Lordship's men stretched themselves upon the ground, and were soon buried in profound sleep.</p> 
               <p>"Just be said and led by me, Master <foreign xml:lang="GAI">achee!</foreign> an' I'll lay my life we'll get out o' this throuble, an' gim my Lord Ogilvie a kick in his gallop, afore as many hours run away as I've fingers an' toes;" cautiously whispered Dan Connell in his most conciliating tone.</p> 
               <p>"How can we do that?" asked Murty Oge, in the suppressed voice of one who was struggling with intense passion. 'Haven't you thrust me into this fog-bank of a Chapel, and forced me to skulk from my foes, when I might have made sail and beat them? By--, I'll face the--"</p> 
               <p>"Masther! Masther! only lend me your ear afore you're a dead man intirely.</p> 
               <p>"Don't be ruinating yourself, an' the Clan, thin wid any such notions; but considher how the Cutther 'ill be back at eleven o'clock,-an' remimber you towld her not to stir a cable's length till you comed to imbark; an' bid Thady Flannigan keep 'The Rose' in waitin' t'other side o' the island, where our innimies niver 'ill dhrame iv turnin' their eyes to see in the dark;-an' bethink you, we'll have six tight boys besides our two sefs to man 'The Rose,' our darlint Cutther, to Bantry-Bay. So all we've to do is to wait till the middle o' the night, whin we'll let ourselfs down through the little thrap-door, an' stale as asy away as a thief of a cat wud walk on a pipin' hot griddle o' piraties-an' thin' all right, an; tight an' nate, we'll catch up the women below in the Cave, an' be off in style to the Cutther, that 'ill, be back by that time, an' thin in the crack iv a fan we'll be over the saas to ould Ireland, afore thim schamin' blackguards are out o' their first dhramin' sleep. Now, Sir, don't I spaak sinse?"</p> 
               <p>The voluble Dan started to his feet, checking his whispered eloquence as he put the last question. The Rapparee in a low arnest voice supported O'Connell's proposal; and Syl, added two or three words in approval of the bold advice which had been given. Had The Sullivan followed his predominant inclination he would certainly have risked a contest with foes whose numbers, in comparison with those of his own party, were in the unequal ratio of four to one, but he determined to <unclear>follow</unclear> the advice of his companions.</p> 
               <p>As The O'Sullivan came to this decision, he briefly whispered his assent to the wishes of this followers.</p> 
               <p>The hours seemed slow and dreary to the prisoners in the chapel before the time arrived when they judged it prudent <unclear>to</unclear> essay the stolen movement they had planned.</p> 
               <p>Hitherto, they had remained as still as possible, but when, acccording to their best calculations, midnight had arrived, they determined to attempt the proposed escape.</p> 
               <p>The operation of raising the trap-door was almost as <unclear>noiseless</unclear> as any that had preceded it: but though our fugitives, <unclear>on</unclear> reaching the slab, which it will be recollected lay <unclear>between,</unclear> used every precaution in coaxing the trap-door to a <unclear/> position, yet the creak that accompanied the process <unclear>of operating</unclear> and depressing it had not been quite imperceptible to the ears of the inmates of the Cave, though the sounds <unclear>failed</unclear> to reach the more distant ones of Ogilvie.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan seized his arm, and in a hollow whisper <unclear>angrily</unclear> commanded silence, at the same time ordering the <unclear>Rapparee</unclear> to remain as a watch beside the trap-door until he <unclear>and</unclear> his foster-brother gained the Cave; after which it was <unclear>agreed</unclear> that the Sentinel should follow with Syl to join their <unclear>chieftain</unclear>.</p> 
               <p>Without losing a moment, The O'Sullivan rushed down the <unclear>stairs</unclear> and ran across the cavern to a particular spot, which no <unclear>darkness</unclear> could prevent his practised steps from reaching. <unclear>The</unclear> O'Sullivan threw open a secret entrance which had been <unclear>ally</unclear> concealed among the intricacies of the cavern.</p> 
               <p>With a terrifed grasp, Syl, who had just descended with Rapparee, impulsively clung for protection to Dan <unclear>Connell;</unclear> so that while the latter was trying to shake off his ponderous<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8325-00000032"/> derous burthen, The O'Sullivan gained many yards in advance; and, before his foster-brother reached his side, had flung the private entrance open.</p> 
               <p>The starlight that shortly afterwards gleamed suddenly through the half-open portal fell directly upon Eva and her Nurse, and betrayed their shrinking figures as, afraid to breathe, they were stealthily trying to creep into a hiding-place, at the moment when The O'Sullivan, angry at the delay of his followers, returned to the cavern.</p> 
               <p>"Do not, do not force us to go with you-in mercy do not!" cried Eva Dillon, as, seeing that all hope of concealment was gone, she clasped her hands and held them up in supplication while she flung herself at the feet of the dreaded <unclear>Chieftain</unclear>. The forlorn helplessness of her condition rushed at <unclear>once to</unclear> Eva's mind, and falling back into the arms of her <unclear>expostulating</unclear> Nurse, she attempted no resistance to the grasp <unclear>of the</unclear> O'Sullivan, when, darting forward, he gagged and <unclear>blindfolded</unclear> her, while Connell did the same to his Sister, <unclear>whose further</unclear> remonstances were thus quickly silenced.</p> 
               <p>"Follow, and be silent, as you value life," said <unclear>The O'Sullivan</unclear> in an authoritative whisper.</p> 
               <p>Thus exhorted, Father Syl obeyed.</p> 
               <p>Murty Oge bearing Eva in his arms, and Connell <unclear/> with the heavier burthen of his Sister, then passed <unclear>through</unclear> the secret entrance, followed by the Rapparee and Syl, <unclear>who could</unclear> scarcely muster courage to obey the order he had <unclear>previously</unclear> received to fasten the subterranean entrance to the <unclear>Cave</unclear>.</p> 
               <p>At a short distance The O'Sullivan's cutter was moored, with her head to sea, and near the wind, awaiting the appearance of the Irish Buccaneers.</p> 
               <p>Her boat, agreeably to the order which The O'Sullivan had given, was lying close to the shore, directed by two sailors.</p> 
               <p>To those men their Chieftain made a sign for silence, that abundantly denoted the importance of his mute command, and the temper in which it was dictated. His wishes were understood, and instantly obeyed. Without even a whisper being breathed, the feeble resistance of Eva and her Nurse was quickly conquered; and, in a few moments, the whole party were seated in the boat.</p> 
               <p>The seamen performed their duties so cautiously that the sound of the oars were nearly inaudible; and, ere many instants had expired, their little bark was brought under the bow of the adjacent ship.</p> 
               <p>By the successful assistance of all hands, the terrified women were safely placed within the vessel.</p> 
               <p>The next moment, the Pirates were on board, and the boat was hauled up the side of the Cutter.</p> 
               <p>Everything being in order, The O'Sullivan whispered the word "Heave!"</p> 
               <p>No sooner was it uttered than the little vessel cut the parting waters, and with swelling sails swept through them towards Ireland; while, as if to screen her from detection, mists and clouds rolled over the face of the moon, and the obscurity of night suddenly increased to almost total darkness.</p> 
               <p>Aided by this circumstance and a highly-favourable breeze, the vessel, as quiet as the grave, securely rode the open sea undiscovered by the anxious Lord Ogilvie, who absorbed in his own thoughts, was pacing the side of the Skelig Rocks that lay exactly in a contrary direction to the one from which our voyagers embarked.</p> 
               <p>Strong in resolution as we have described Eva to be, still it was only natural that in the first instance Eva Dillon's energy <unclear>should</unclear> fail, so that she sank beneath the woman's fears which <unclear>rent</unclear> her bosom.</p> 
               <p>
                  <unclear>Awed</unclear> by Eva Dillon's majestic spirit, and touched by her <unclear>innocence</unclear>, a rising respect for her called up the few good <unclear>feelings</unclear> which vicious habits had not quenched within the <unclear>breast</unclear> of the Chief of the Irish Buccaneers.</p> 
               <p>
                  <unclear>As from</unclear> beneath his contracted brow he fixed a deep glance <unclear>on his</unclear> young and beautiful victim, he instinctively <unclear>acknowledged her</unclear> purity in contrast to his own guilt; and, actuated by <unclear>one of those</unclear> sudden movements of the inner man to which <unclear>we have alluded</unclear>, Murty Oge obeyed the momentary impulse, <unclear>and abstained</unclear> from profaning Eva's ear by declaration of his passion.</p> 
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8325-00000033"/> 
               <p>The wind having been full in favour of the ship when sailing from the Skeligs, she sped with so much swiftness, that before the change of weather we have mentioned had begun she was floating in the deep expansive harbour of Kilmakalogue.</p> 
               <p>Pursuing her course, the vessel sailed up the majestic river until she was a breast of Ardea Castle, the ancient seat of The O'Sullivans.</p> 
               <p>If Eva's mind had not been engrossed by harrowing fears, she must have derived the highest pleasure from contemplating a landscape so congenial to her refined taste. Thus as the Cutter flew along the river, her eye had been little more than momentarily interested; but when, having anchored in the middle of the channel, opposite Ardea Castle, The O'Sullivan announced his design to land, Eva, by an increased pressure of Norah's arm, and a sudden quickness of breathing, manifested that all her agitations were renewed. Curbing those new fears, however, she obeyed The O'Sullivan in descending with Norah into the small boat, which having been lowered from the Cutter, waited to receive them.</p> 
               <p>Without speaking a word, The O'Sullivan sat down beside our heroine; Connell and the Rapparee having seized an oar each, a few strokes of their paddles sent the little bark dancing to the verdant shore. As the rowers neared it, impassioned exclamations in the Irish language were distinctly heard, and almost in the same moment a figure was seen under the brow of a projecting rock close to the brink of the water.</p> 
               <p>The back of the man was turned to the river, and his form was bent over something on shore that was covered with a frieze cloak, and which he seemed to be attentively considering.</p> 
               <p>The position of the person thus employed concealed his face, but, as Murty Oge was now in that part of his territory where feudal devotion to himself existed to the almost extent, he felt almost positive that he beheld a friend.</p> 
               <p>Caution, however, seldom left him; therefore, ordering a sudden halt, he raised his finger to his mouth and gave the shrill peculiar whistle which had often served as a note of reunion to hundreds of his clan.</p> 
               <p>The kneeling figure sprang to his feet, and lifted his clenched hands, while his eyes seemed starting forth as with an expression of surprise, anxiety, and pleasure, he fixed them on the boat.</p> 
               <p>"'Tis our good kinsman and namesake, Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tongue Arrigud,</foreign>" said the Chieftain, as he motioned to his men to oar again.</p> 
               <p>"By the powers 't is his own purty self, for all the world as thin as a gridiron, an' as yellow as a kite's claw! Fellow me his like for a scholard an' a beauty from the top o' the north to the kingdom o' Kerry!" cried Dan Connell; and, dashing to land, he hastily roared out, "Here we are! here we are! Schoolmaster agra! comed back to ould Ireland all of a suddent from off iv a cruise, wid (success to our timbers!) a bit iv a prize that's well worth a hailing."</p> 
               <p>Instead of returning Dan's vociferous ejaculations, he of the Silver Tongue impressively waved one hand, while, raising the other to his lips, he stood perfectly still, assuming an aspect so lowering and an air of mystery so profound, that Connell, as the boat touched the shore, exclaimed as evident amazement.</p> 
               <p>The schoolmaster strode to the water's edge, and seizing the arm of his Chief, who had just sprung to the shore, he cautiously whispered some words in his ear. The grim visage of the latter was marked by a dark surprise, as he listened to his kinsman's communication, and, despite of the firmness of his nerves, his eye became disturbed, while, in a manner somewhat irresolute, he ordered Connell and the Rapparee to assist the females to land, and to wait with them for his further directions. Then, plunging his arm into his breast, he walked aside with his kinsman, and continued a whispered conversation, which, from the appearance of the speakers, seemed equally energetic and important. The confident assurance of Dan Connell instantly settled into a profound silence, and, though he obeyed his master by placing our<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8325-00000034"/> heroine ashore, while the Rapparee did the same for Norah and the Priest, yet his eyes continued fixed with fearful interest on the distant figures of his Chief and the renowned Silver-tongue schoolmaster of Kenmare.</p> 
               <p>A low cry of horror which burst from Eva Dillon, and was echoed by Syl, made Connell quickly turn round his face, which, notwithstanding his natural callousness, expressed both sorrow and surprise, when it rested on a dead and mangled body, which it was evident had recently been washed to land. The head and shoulders were bare; the rest of the figure was wrapped in an old Irish mantle, and, stiff and cold, the corpse was stretched upon the ground precisely where Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tongue Arrigud</foreign> had been first discovered by his countrymen.</p> 
               <p>"Wurrah! wurrah! Tim <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Lauve Darrig</foreign>-Tim o' the Red Hand!-is this the end you've come to at last?-to be dhrowned like a cat, an' lift dead on our hands in no time at all!" exclaimed Connell, as with unusual emotion he looked on the hard and bloodless face of his former comrade, and extended one arm towards it, while with the other he held the affrighted girl, who, trembling in every joint, was obliged to lean against him for support.</p> 
               <p>"Daniel Connell, now look to the jewel o' the earth that you hould in your arums as white as a sheet, an' lave the dead man to take care iv himse'f; an' if you've a spark o' tindher feelin' about yees, an' wouldn't put a nail in my coffin, why take us away from the sight o' sights!" cried Norah, gasping for breath; and, no longer able to suppress the outbreak of her agitation, she caught her brother's shoulder between her hands, and gazed into his face with a depth of expression which even his rude soul could scarcely resist.</p> 
               <p>"Don't be afeard iv the dead, ye poor foolish crathurs! Shure his 'Red Hand' can't hurt yees now!" cried Dan Connell, quickly bearing Eva to the other side of a rock which Syl, guided by the instinct that always made him shun disagreeable objects, had already reached. The rock behind which the priest had squatted himself completely screened the corpse from view; and as Connell reached the level spread of ground that lay between it and other pilings of stone which shot up here and there in curious configurations, he placed Eva by her nurse's side, and could not avoid relaxing his features into some rude sympathy with their agitation, as clinging close together they crouched upon the grass.</p> 
               <p>While this little scene was passing, Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tongue Arrigud</foreign> briefly stated that the tide had just washed up Tim's corpse and then proceeded to advise The O'Sullivan to wait instantly on a Magistrate, in order to declare his ignorance of rebelious motives which during his absence had been circulated until the present moment.</p> 
               <p>The whole of this communication had not occupied ten minutes.</p> 
               <p>At its conclusion. The O'Sullivan suddenly withdrew the hand with which he had latterly veiled his face.</p> 
               <p>It was pale as ashes, but calmly stern, when, without giving any expression of his feelings, except what his countenance betrayed, he thanked his kinsman, and assented to the wisdom of his plan, as well as to its adoption.</p> 
               <p>The Chieftain then, by an ingenious tale, accounted for the past residence abroad and the present return of Norah Connell, who, from a report sedulously spread by her brother, years ago, was supposed to have died on a pilgrimage to Lough Dergh.</p> 
               <p>With the same brevity, The O'Sullivan communicated a story devised between him and his special confidants, and which, under the seal of secrecy, was to explain the equally unexpected appearance of Eva Dillon.</p> 
               <p>It had been arranged that to the few individuals whose services it might be necessary to employ, our heroine should be represented as a person mysteriously connected with the fortunes of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, and placed by him beneath the temporary care and custody of The O'Sullivan-Beare.</p> 
               <p>Norah's attachment to, and connexion with her fair charge were explained with a clever ingenuity and a disregard to truth equal to that which dictated the whole of the Irish Chief's narration;-neverthless, the story was so speciously<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8325-00000035"/> revised, that it imposed completely even on our learned pundit. Perceiving this, The O'Sullivan signified his desire that the females should be lodged immediately in Ardea Castle, where under the strict <foreign xml:lang="FRA">surveillance</foreign> of Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tongue Arrigud,</foreign> he wished them to remain concealed until affairs became more settled.</p> 
               <p>This proposition commanded unqualified assent from the village pedagogue; and, as he gave it, he raised his eyes from the huge brass buckles of his brogues, where in admiration they had lately rested, and fixed them, with an air of ludicrous importance, on his kinsman. Then drawing up his tall person to a perpendicularity as erect as a sign-post, the jerked the suit of rusty black that hung in threadbare folds about his gawky figure, and placed his hands within the gaping pocket-holes of his nether garments, while his sallow visage lengthened until it almost seemed as if sufficient light were admitted through the stretched parchment of his meagre cheeks to count the teeth within.</p> 
               <p>Having assumed this imposing aspect, Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tongue Arrigud</foreign> stalked after The O'Sullivan, who, with a less dignified step, had already joined the party by the river's side.</p> 
               <p>Immediate despatch seemed the object of the Chief of the Buccaneers. Consigning Eva to the guidance of his kinsman, and Norah to that of the Rapparee, he ordered them to ascend the lonely bridle-path, which, in zigzag windings, led up several mountain swells towards the rock platform on which the edifice of Ardea Castle stood. While the party slowly and silently pursued their toilsome way, The O'Sullivan, who, with Syl and Dan Connell, kept considerably in the rear-recommenced the recital of the conversation he held with the Schoolmaster of Kenmare, and communicated to them the important news he had received.</p> 
               <p>At this unexpected intelligence, Connell was taking fire, when the monitory eye of his Master, fixed on him in cold and stern caution, made him check his temper, and, fully conquering it, he entered, with his characteristic quickness, into every project connected with the present emergency.</p> 
               <p>Plunging at once into business, he commended the intentions tions of his chief, and signified his own determination to accompany him to Ross Mac Owen the moment our heroine and her Nurse were lodged in Ardea Castle, which, as it had been searched already by the Military, seemed from that circumstance, and its isolated situation, the safest retreat that could be chosen.</p> 
               <p>For many reasons, it was considered advisable for Syl to appear at Ross Mac Owen. The priest, thinking it a much better domicile than Ardea Castle, willingly acceded to the proposal of partaking its good cheer, and promised to remain quite passive during any arrangements which his companions might deem necessary.</p> 
               <p>Clapping his hands in token of approbation, Dan with the agility of a deer, ran in pursuit of the advanced party, who after twenty minutes' clambering, had just reached the bottom of a flight of steps which, cut rudely in the rock ascended to the main entrance of the castle.</p> 
               <p>"Hundhers o' welcomes to the fine ould roof in Ardea, my <foreign xml:lang="GAI">cushlas!</foreign> an' well may ye bide here a while wid his Honour Misther Murty. <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tongue Arrigud,</foreign> to keep ye good company, an' give ye a thrifle o' larnin'; an this nate an' genteel Rapparee to guard ye from harum, an' to bring ye your mate an' your dhrink dog chape, all <foreign xml:lang="LAT">gratis</foreign> for nothin', till the Masther an' I come back, wid Syl, from the berrin' iv Tim <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Lauve Darrig,</foreign> that broth iv a boy that lies down in the glin as dead as mutton-the curse o' the crows be off iv his corpse!"-cried Dan, as, having scampered to the uppermost step, he tossed his cap in the air, and cut a caper two yards from the ground. Then placing himself full in the arched and open doorway which afforded ingress to the castle, he prepared to do the honours of reception to our heroine as though he were its veritable Master.</p> 
               <p>A host of contending feelings gave energy to the efforts Eva made to preserve an appearance of composure; and, aware of the inutility of shrinking from what could not be avoided, she ascended firmly to the side of Daniel Connell.</p> 
               <p>Then turning round, she faced the whole landscape, and silently bent her searching looks in all directions to survey<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8325-00000036"/> the localities of the place she clearly perceived would henceforth be her prison.</p> 
               <p>Peculiar loneliness and striking loveliness were the characteristics of the scene.</p> 
               <p>It was a rude strong edifice, which, alternately bleached and blackened by the action of the elements, looked, to a fanciful eye, like a part of the high and craggy cliff on which it was erected. At one view, a sweep of hundreds of leagues on sea and land was taken in.</p> 
               <p>When Eva, in the mood of excited feelings which the scene produced, turned to look at Norah, she caught her eye fixed on the ancient Castle with a depth of expression such as she had never witnessed.</p> 
               <p>But little time for observation, however, was allowed, as Connell, having entered the black and open doorway, called on Eva to do the same.</p> 
               <p>She obeyed, and, closely followed by her Nurse, stepped into a long dark passage built in the body of a thick wall, which after many windings, ushered them into the arch-roofed and pillared hall of the Castle of Ardea.</p> 
               <p>It was a spacious stone floored chamber hung with very ancient armour 'Everything looked monotonously dark, the light that was partially admitted being barely sufficient to define interior objects.</p> 
               <p>All now was silent as the graves of the former Chiefs of Ardea Castle, and, while Eva Dillon stood in the centre of that ancient hall, she involuntarily drew a comparison between the present and the past, with feelings as agitating as they were novel and unaccountable. In those emotions Nurse Norah seemed to sympathize strangely, for, as she stood stationary near her youthful Mistress, she held her head erect, her lips quivering with a kind of vague meaning, and her brow bent as if she longed to vent the feelings that were labouring in her breast. At this instant, the degenerate representative of The O'Sullivans entered the Hall of his Fathers, and as Connell and the Rapparee advanced some steps to meet him, Norah, acting by stealth, laid her trembling hand on Eva's arm, and, giving a peculiar look of caution, quickly whispered-</p> 
                
               <p>"This ain't the <emph>fust</emph> time <emph>you</emph> wor here!"</p> 
               <p>"Norah, you say so? Oh! can it be true! Tell me-tell me all!" whispered Eva in reply, and utterly astonished.</p> 
               <p>"Umph! by-an'-bye may be I'll spake more about it!" murmured the Nurse, with equal mystery and fear. This hint was quite enough for our observant heroine, and taking it for granted that silence was her safest course, she merely bowed her head as the chief of the Irish Buccaneers, committed her to the charge of his kinsman of "the Silver Tongue," and having promised to see her in a few days, took his leave, accompanied by Syl and Daniel Connell.</p> 
               <p>Eva and her faithful companion were then conducted up a long flight of stairs to their future chamber.</p> 
               <p>It was a small square room built in one of the turrets of the Castle which faced towards the sea. Narrow castellated slits in the deep massive wall a some feet from the floor, answered the purposes of windows. In one corner lay an ancient Irish Harp, all the strings of which were broken, and a worm-eaten but curiously carved table, with a few chairs equally antiquated served to furnish the gloomy and desolate apartment, or rather prison. The adjoining chamber was as destitute of comforts as that we have described; two antique-looking beds, an iron lamp, and an old oak chair being all that it contained.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Murty <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Tongue Arrigud</foreign> bowed profoundly to Eva as he ushered her into this untempting domicile; then, under plea of ordering refreshments and other conveniences, he withdrew, turning the rusty key on the outside of the massive door.</p> 
               <p>As his retiring steps grew fainter, the two despairing females heard those of the Rapparee pacing up and down the room which lay on the exterior of the entrance to their prison. At this sign of the vigilance with which they might expect to be watched in future, hope nearly fled from their hearts, and sinking on their seats they gazed wistfully upon each other, looking the fears they dreaded to express by words.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE VOW OF BLOOD.</head> 
               <p>PASSING over all the minor circumstances, inconveniences, and <emph>spying</emph> to which Eva Dillon and her faithful Nurse had been subjected, we return to Ardea Castle.</p> 
               <p>Eva and her attached companion could hold no confidential intercourse, except during the hours which it was supposed they devoted to sleep.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>The principal part of every night, therefore, was dedicated to whispered conversations relative to the present, past, and future; but despite of all entreaties, Norah, seeming to have repented her few involuntary yet memorable words uttered at the moment she entered the Hall of Ardea Castle, had hitherto obstinately refused to explain them to the anxious and importunate Eva Dillon.</p> 
               <p>Though profoundly disappointed by this unexpected reserve yet finding every effort to remove it inffectual, our heroine, with her usual sweetness of temper, resigned the attempt for the present, trusting that eventually her beloved Nurse would prove less inexorable to her wishes.</p> 
               <p>In daytime, they were allowed the privilege of walking through the beautiful scenery immediately surrounding Ardea Castle, but the invariable presence on those occasions of the Schoolmaster of Kenmare and the ferocious Rapparee prevented any confidential discourse upon their actual situation, or discussion on the many plans for escape which naturally and continually engrossed their thoughts.</p> 
               <p>The sleeping-room they occupied in the turret of the Castle was very small, close, and low-roofed. Oppressed by its confinement, as by intense anxiety, repose so seldom visited the pillows of its inmates that the greater part of every night was passed at the narrow opening that gave the only source of ventilation to their apartment. Outside the locked door of the sitting-room beyond, the Schoolmaster and the Rapparee relieved each other as sentinels through the night. The moon streamed with unwonted radiance upon Eva and her Nurse when, having first shut the door of their sleeping chamber to prevent a syllable being heard, they according to custom shaded their burning lamp, and approached close to the aperture by which air and light were intromitted, Eva occupying a very ancient, high-backed Oaken chair curiously carved, her pale cheek resting on her hand, and her eyes fixed on the beautiful, though limited view on the adjacent scenery which lay gleaming in the moonbeams.</p> 
               <p>Norah, crouched on the floor at the feet of her Mistress, occasionally told her beads with unwonted rapidity, and at other times, suddenly ceasing to repeat her muttered Litanies, she would drop her rosary and sway her body backwards and forwards with a slow, monotonous movement, covering her face with her hands as if to exclude external objects.</p> 
               <p>The solemn night-wind swept in fitful guests around the Castle, but, as yet, so gently that it sounded like what we might imagine would be the sighs of departed Spirits, if permitted to witness and to mourn over the sorrows and the errors of the loved on earth.</p> 
               <p>Eva Dillon's eyes seemed to dwell abstractly on the silver tinted clouds that, every moment changing their picturesque shapes, flitted athwart the sky, which was gradually assuming a more lowering aspect.</p> 
               <p>"An' what is <foreign xml:lang="GAI">ma Colleen</foreign> thinkin' iv? Is it o' the purty klipstick (dilemma) they've putt us in, bad luck to 'em more's the pity?" ejaculated Norah, in a deep whisper, as suddenly she withdrew her hands from her dark, earnest eyes, and fixed them inquiringly and full of melancholy meaning on her young companion.</p> 
               <p>Eva Dillon smiled faintly, as looking down with sweet affection she replied-</p> 
               <p>"Dear Nurse, I have been trying to divert my mind from present misery by dwelling on the happy past! My thoughts just now were with Lord Ogilvie, the dear companion of our youth, and with her who has been as the fondest Mother unto me."</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8325-00000038"/> 
               <p>The word of "Mother" seemed to sting her hearer, for the dark eyes of Norah flung their lightning round her as, looking almost like a Pythoness, she threw back her white coif, and falling suddenly on her knees, clasped her bands together, and whispered in a low voice of deepest solemnity, and as if quite unconscious of previous conversation-</p> 
               <p>"Eva, light o' my eyes an' darlint o' my soul! I'll spake,-<emph>I'll spake!</emph>-An' Mary, forgive and absolve me if the Confission that for years has been tearin' at the fibres o' my heart is tould at the last to <emph>you!</emph>" she added, grasping Eva's arm with the violence of a mental agitation that distorted every feature of her speaking countenance.</p> 
               <p>A strange perturbation, almost equally intense, shook the frame of Eva, which trembled between hope and fear, as a sudden suspicion crossed her mind. The veins of her forehead swelled, her eyes dilated, and looking hurriedly around she gasped forth in the lowest tone, "Oh, do not, do not mock me! Is it of my parents-those who gave me life-that you at length will speak! Is it, my own dear Nurse?" she faltered in still more choking accents, as drop by drop her eloquent tears fell over the cheek on which she flung her own.</p> 
               <p>"IT IS!"</p> 
               <p>There was a solemn silence.</p> 
               <p>"Eva, <foreign xml:lang="GAI">mavourneen!</foreign> I'm goin' to unlock my heart o' hearts, for if I don't 'twill surely burst! In word an' thought an' deed, I've lov'd an' niver wronged ye, since you was a babby at my breast; that is,"-(and here an expression of deep anguish crossed her features)-"I niver <emph>maned</emph> to wrong ye, tho' may be I <emph>have</emph> widout the intintion, by raason that till this blissed hour I've kipt the oath they made me take! But <emph>now</emph>"-here a fearful wildness gleamed from her uplifted eyes-"I see their wickedness, their schames, their life's crimes! An' by this," she added, holding up the large black crucifix that hung at her side, "I'll tell ye all the thruth I know; an' thin, in fastin', prayer, an' pinance, I'll pin my faith, for the absolution o' my sin!" My own heart! listen to me now, an' if ye can help it, don't spake a word, good or bad to break the thread o' my discoorse."</p> 
               <p>The agitated Eva bowed assent, and Norah thus continued: "'Tis about sixteen summers, or as good as may be, since I was woke up out o' my draamin' sleep in the middle o' the night, by my broder Dan Connell, an' whisked off afore him on a horse as mad as himsef, widout spaakin' one word, to this sefsame Castle iv Ardea, where you and I are sated now in the bright sunshine. We niver crack'd cry till we comed to this sthrange ould place, an' here, shure enough, was The O'Sullivan-Beare, an' in a mortual pucker he looked, whin, widout spaakin' a word, he hoisted me off iv my four-footed baste, an' thin pulled me by the right hand, fust up on one stair, and thin down another, and thin up agin, an' on, till we come to a fine clever large bedroom:-'Here's the Nurse I promised come at last!' said the Masther to the beautifullest lady I ever set my two livin' eyes upon, who was stretched on a grand testher bed, wid a sweet little new-born babby beside iv her. Her face was as white an' as cowld as the grave-stones whin the moon shines over 'em, an' her tongue was as silent too!-That lady-that angel on airth-<foreign xml:lang="GAI">Cushla Machree</foreign>-was--"</p> 
               <p>"MY MOTHER!"-ejaculated Eva, almost choked with agitation, as she seized the extended hand of Norah, and pressed it to her throbbing heart, without power to add another word.</p> 
               <p>"You spake God's thruth," solemnly whispered the sympathizing Nurse; "an' <emph>you</emph> was the small, tendher crathur that lay on her snow-white bussom, wid your dear little hand acrass it, looking for all the world like a cherub o' God asleep in the arums o' one iv his Saints! An' as I gazed on your own blessed Mother lyin' there wid all her beauty on her sweet pale face, I saw that Death was hard by, an' was come to dale his last blow!-so I riz her up in my arums, an' hugged her close to my warm heart-('twas <emph>young</emph> thin, dear!) an' I poured some dhrops iv a cordial down her throat, an' my hot tears fell fast on her frozen cheek, as I call'd her by every fond Irish name, an' pray'd that Heaven might be her bed, if<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8325-00000039"/> God <emph>would</emph> take her away!-but she heeded me not at all at all, darlint! but fixed her sweet eyes on The O'Sullivan Beare, who stood lookin' like a dumbfoundhered dare-divil close by her side. The angels o' Heaven that wor all round her bed (tho' by rason iv our sins we couldn't discarn 'em) gave her strength to start up from her pillow all iv a suddent; an' thin, in a voice, the sweet sound o' which I'll niver hear the likes iv agin in this base wicked world, she laid one hand on her baby, an' fixin' a last look on the Chief, gasped out in long heavy brathing that burnt every word straight into the memory o' my heart-'Swear to befrind my Child, for the sake iv him who lost life in defending <emph>yours!</emph> 
                  <emph>His</emph> death has been <emph>mine</emph>-you towld it so suddinly-so--but I forgive-my heart is broken!'</p> 
               <p>"'She raves!-she's deminted!' said the Chief, pushing me all a one side. 'Be off!' he cried, pointin' to the door: 'Be off this minute!' but Norah Connell wasn't the omadhaun he tuk her for;-an' so, widout wid or by your lave, I dropped on my two bended knees, an' prayed for the sowl o' the dying saint-for she was <emph>that,</emph> if ever there was one upon airth!-An' thin, as the Chief riz her up still more in the bed, she laned on her elbow, an' struve an' struve to spake, an' at last these words forced their ways out-'Swear to purtect my Child!-an <emph>if</emph> my faithful servant ever returns--' Core o' my heart! at that self-same awful minute the death-rattle saazed on her throath, an' not another word could she spake; so just layin' her hand on her sleepin' babby-that's <emph>you,</emph> dear'-her eyes, like two fallin' stars, flashed a wild light, that towld how her poor dying heart was wringin' to know if he'd take that vow; an' thin The O'Sullivan, all in a flusther, as if to get rid o' that pint an' to come to anither while there was time, said 'I <emph>do</emph> swear!' an' thin, rushin' up to the dyin' lady agin an' agin, through his set teeth, as if the diaoul (purtect us!) put words in his mouth, he stormed an' thundhered out-'But why that <emph>if?</emph> Don't ye <emph>know</emph> that your servant is dead? Why thin that <emph>if?</emph> Spake! Do you hear? Spake!'</p> 
               <p>"But gettin' no answer at all at all, he repaated his quistion, an' shuck the arum o' the dyin' darlint, as if, for all the world, 't was one iv his Cutther's cables; an' so mad entirely was he, that sorra a one o' him tuck note o' my prisence the laste taste in life: but whether he did or did not was no great matther, seeing as how I wouldn't have stirred a stump for the best he that ever throd on shoe-leather! An' thin, all iv a suddint, a bright light seemed to shine out round the blessed head o' the dyin' lady, an' raisin' her hand, she pointed to heaven an' smiled like an Angel, as she soon was to be-for I heard the music o' God above her! an' thin, turnin' round wid all the world iv a Mother's love baaming out iv her dyin' eyes, she dropped gently down jist close to her Child, an' brathed her last sigh on your tiny lips, an' I felt that her glory was on me!"</p> 
               <p>As Norah solemnly uttered those words she covered her face, and large drops which fell between her long thin fingers silently told the agitation the recital of this well-remembered scene created.</p> 
               <p>Not a sob, word, nor cry had escaped from Eva Dillon during the narration, and when Norah uncovered her features she was terrified at the fixedness of the young maiden's face, which had become like marble, while her frame shook dreadfully, and her eyes were still riveted upon her Nurse, as if under the spell of a fascination she had not power to break.</p> 
               <p>"Queen o' the Saints aboove us!" whispered Norah, starting to her feet, as she looked on the noble countenance over which such a marked change had passed, and caught her nursling to her breast in a sudden burst of terrified fondness: "What's over her? Eva! deep pulse o'my life! for the sake o' the ould heart that's rock'd you to sleep wid its batings ten thousand o' times!-for the sake o' the Saints an' the Angels o' Heaven that crowd round your Mother in glory-<emph>Spake!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>At this appeal, torrents of tears gushed from Eva's eyes, which, losing their stony look, kindled into deep and profound excitement, as in a low husky voice she repeated the word "<emph>Mother!</emph>" and straining her Nurse still closer to her breast, softly faltered out-"<emph>Go on!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="GAI">Avourneen ma chree!</foreign>" whispered Norah, as she looked long and tenderly on the sweet face that lay on her shoulder,<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8325-00000040"/> while the warm tears of affection fell in showers from her cheek upon it; "I have n't much more to tell, an' supposing I had, how <emph>could</emph> I go on, my own darlint, whin my discoorse is brakin' your fresh young heart, like the storm that snaps the stim iv the rose?"</p> 
               <p>"Nurse, dear Nurse," faltered Eva, upraising her head, and making a violent effort to subdue her emotion as she sank again upon her seat; "I <emph>will</emph> be more calm; but, oh! to hear I had so sweet a Mother! to know that I have lost her for ever! and still to feel bewildered as if in a fearful dream in all that most concerned her, is hard-most hard to bear! She was-she <emph>must</emph> have been all my heart could wish! Yet still <emph>who</emph> was my father, or, I should rather say, <emph>her husband,</emph> for <emph>that</emph> a voice from Heaven tells me that he was."</p> 
               <p>"As shure as there's a God, you spake the blessed thruth," rejoined Norah, solemnly-"No <emph>get</emph> iv a light-o'-love are you! I'd sale <emph>that</emph> wid my blood-an' yit, pride o' my eyes an' my sowl! wid all that I've done to come at the <emph>whole</emph> o' the thruth, it has always sliddhered away from myself like a slippery eel!"</p> 
               <p>"But surely, surely you must know <emph>something</emph> more? Oh, Nurse, sweet Nurse! tell all; in pity tell me all!" gasped Eva, clasping her hands in fervent entreaty while a bright flush passed over her blanched cheek, and hope once more sparkled in her eyes, as she prepared to listen in silence and anxiety.</p> 
               <p>"I'll say my say at any rate, <emph>asthore!</emph> an' thin, why shure ye can judge," answered Norah, as reseating herself on the floor and drawing herself up to her former position, she muttered over her beads for a few moments, and then, with increased earnestness, thus in a cautious whisper, she took up the thread of her strange history. "Well whin The O'Sullivan-Beare saw the sweet crathur was dead entirely, he bolted out iv the room, an' left me to lay out the body; an' whin I moved it, what should I find but a long black ribbon tied round the neck, an' fastened to it war two beautiful picthurs, one on aither side iv the gowld framin'; an' one o' thim war as like as two eggs to the darlint that lay stretched out stone dead afore me! an' t'other was the picthur iv as fine a <emph>moral</emph>

               <p>"Nurse! Nurse! you took those pictures-you have preserved-Oh! give them!" gasped Eva Dillon, her agitation becoming so irrepressible that she could not persevere in silence.</p> 
               <p>"Surely I did, an' more than that, I cut off an ocean iv the gowlden hair o' your blessed Mother, an' fastened it wid the black ribbon all round the picthurs, intindin' to give 'em both to the Chief; but what I seed afther made me clare an' clane change my mind, an' keep e'm all to myself, unknownst to a sowl and,' light o' my eyes! here they are safe an' sound now this blessed minute, whin the Queen o' Heaven (praise an' glory be hers!) diricts my tongue t' unlock my owld heart, an' spake out like a Christin woman, to circumvent all the divilish lies an' intintions an' schames, even iv my own born broder, an' what's more, iv the Chief o' my Clan An' for why would I not, whin I known for sartin (and she shuddered at the thought) that they're bent on the ruination o' the dear one I've nursed at my breast, an' who'll live in my heart till death an' judgmint, whin I hope to see God face to face at the last great day!"</p> 
               <p>Anxiety and agitation that seemed to torture every feature out of its proper lineament were fearfully depicted on our heroine's countenance, as, without power to pronounce a syllable in reply to this affecting address, she extended her hand for the expected treasure. Norah now drew it forth from her bosom, and breaking the sealed cover, a long luxuriant tress of hair fell on Eva's knee, glistening in the strong moonlight like a sheet of waving gold. In agitation too great for utterance, the trembling girl caught up the precious relic, and fervently pressed it to her quivering lips. The next instant, she grasped the miniatures from Norah's hand, and, as if her<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8325-00000041"/> whole soul was in her eyes, gazed in solemn tenderness alternately on the pictured images of those who gave her being.</p> 
               <p>In sympathy and silence poor Norah watched the progress of the power she had evoked, her eyes shining through her tears, and her heart throbbing in anxiety, while, with instinctive delicacy, forbearing to require a word from the mournful and agitated girl before her, she softly said:</p> 
               <p>"Look on! look on! as long as ye like, dear blood o' my veins 't would break the heart widin me to disturb ye-tho' may be," she added with affectionate hesitation, "ye'd like to know all the little that's now left to be tould?"</p> 
               <p>"I would, dear Nurse, I <emph>would,</emph>" faltered Eva in a deep exhausted voice; and, unable to say one word more, and almost suffocated by her emotions, she passed the ribbon of the miniature around her neck, and placed the tresses next her heart.</p> 
               <p>"Well thin. After I decently laid out the beautiful flower o' the field that was soon to be laid in the dust, I tuck ye up (and a sweet wee crathur ye was!) in my own two arums, an' wint down fair an' aisy to the kitchen in this sef-same Castle iv Ardea, an' whin I went on an' on through this great barrack iv a place, widout meeting a sowl, I fairly wondhered, but what struck me all iv a heap entirely was, whin, at last finding the kitchen (bad cess to it!) I saw stretched out stiff in a chair a decent young faymale, an' not another Christin good nor bad! Whether the crathur was only sleepin' or dead, I know just as little now as thin; but this I <emph>do</emph> know for sartain that I shuck her agin an' agin, but sorra a bit iv her moved hand or fut, no more than if she was dead as a herrin'; so at last I bawled in her ear an' axed her for the love o' Heaven to wake up and spake; and at that blessed minute Dan Connell, my broder, walks in, an says, says he,-</p> 
               <p>"Don't be afther bothering that poor crathur, that's worn out entirely wid the watchin' and throuble she had at the birth o' that babby you're howldin', but just lave her, Norah, to sleep her sleep out, an' come off wid me to the Masther, who's waiting, as mad as blazes, to see ye both in the parlour.'</p> 
                
               <p>"An wid that, what did he do but drags me an' the babby, <emph>a-lannan!</emph> that lay on my bussom as if 'twas my own, up the stairs, an' niver cracked cry till we was both to the fore o' the Masther; an' there shure enough he was marchin' up an' down in a sort iv a silent <foreign xml:lang="GAI">tantarara,</foreign> an' Och by my bades, what a heart I had whin he fixed his one great eye (an' faix <emph>that</emph> is a piercer!) right full on me an' the poor fairy thing in my arums. A'n 'twas blazing, it was, like a bonfire whin he wint on spaakin' a power o' words that only seemed to consale what he meant, for afther all his palaverin' circumbendibus iv a story, I couldn't for the bare life o' me make out whether he intended to say he was fader to the weeney darlint I held-(that's you dear!)-or no; tho' 'twas fairly he <emph>was</emph> by himself an' by Dan; an' so, whin my Chief pushed a big Bible that lay on the table right foment me, an' towld me to swear on <emph>The Book</emph> niver to let on he was fader to the child, seein' as how the Holy Church hadn't sanctioned that same; an', moreover, at no time at all, at all, to brathe to one livin' sowl what I'd seed in the Castle, one way or other, but jist to bring up the babby in the thrue Roman faith, an' to lade her to think him her guardian, by name Captain Smith.</p> 
               <p>"Well, so frightened an' flustrefied was my poor sef that I tuck that same oath, an' shure that's what's cuttin' into the core o' my heart, <foreign xml:lang="GAI">a-cushla-ma-chree!</foreign> Och, now! don't ax me to stop till I come to the end o' my story," whispered Norah impetuously (seeing that Eva was about to speak), "an' 'tis as short as I can I'll make it, an' no spinning out! An' so, you see, after much more o' their blarneyin', I was towld that we two crathurs o' faymales (that's you and myself, darlint!) would be packed off at screech o' day in the schooner wid Dan Connell to foreign parts; an' that in a strange land beyant saa we'd have lashins o' money from time to time an' a nate purty house to cover our heads, in which you'd be brought up, till such time as the Masther would trate us back to ould Ireland! An' faix, 'tis but justice to say that wid all their sins an' quare doings they sent us the yellow boys in saison, an' tis happy enough, dear knows! we wor in our own doat iv a weeny place, which the darlint Martchioness<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8325-00000042"/> made as good as a fairy land inside an out, to say nothin' o' the beautiful harp an guitar an' oceans o' books in all the tongues of Babel, that she gave ye. An' for that same bright grassy spot, wid its wildherness o' flowers, like fallen rainbows on airth, an' its owld green trees, and warm, soft sunshine, shure we had but a thrifle o' rint to pay! Thin, wasn't my own Star o' the world just as good as a residenter almost up at the grand castle of Tullibardine from the minute whin the Martchioness (pace be wid her!) saw ye by chance playin' on the bright green forenent our own little door, an' tuck sich a fancy to have ye for company, an' to tache ye the larnin' an' musicks, till ye know'd better far nor the lady hersef?

               <p>As Norah muttered these words she passed one hand in a hurried manner over her brow, and then wreathed her long fingers together in earnest prayer, but with such noiseless action that the silence of the chamber was unbroken.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE LION ENSNARED.</head> 
               <p>THE British Government had passed an Act of Indemnity, granting a pardon to those who had been engaged in the rebellion in favour of the Stuarts, from which act of grace eighty individuals were excepted.</p> 
               <p>Though Lord Ogilvie's name was indited on that awful list of proscription, the ban would doubtless, had he so wished, have been instantly repealed in consideration of his gallant conduct and intrepidity at the scene of the murder of Mr. Puxley-the nobility of his voluntary self-surrender to Government, and the importance of the depositions he had made in the proper quarter.</p> 
               <p>The applause bestowed by the highest authorities in the realm on such chivalrous exploits was unanimous, and a public testimonial was tendered, in the most delicate and respectful manner, to Lord Ogilvie.</p> 
               <p>It was, however, politely declined by his Lordship, who, ever incapable of dissimulation, took that opportunity to avow that his political sentiments and devotion to the house of Stuart being perfectly unchanged, he held himself a free agent, as unshackled as ever in thought and action.</p> 
               <p>Agreeing that it was wisest to take no notice of this open declaration, the Government (having first repealed every political restriction against Lord Ogilvie) bent all its energies towards crushing the now comparatively small remnant of the Hibernian insurgents.</p> 
               <p>It was, indeed, high time to quell the dangerous confederacy of the Irish Buccaneers, whose general character and designs had been so fully demonstrated in the recent murder of Mr. Puxley by their audacious Chief and leader.</p> 
               <p>As a primary step, Walter Fitzmorris, a magistrate, of the County, accompanied by Ogilvie was ordered to Iveragh with a large party of soldiers, in order to effect the arrest of the notorious O'Sullivan-Beare. A large price was instantly set upon the head of that formidable insurgent, in consequence of which he had taken refuge with his retainers in the wilds of Iveragh Bearehaven, in the West.</p> 
               <p>The extensive waste forming part of its wide-spreading lands legitimately belonged to The O'Sullivans in those by gone days when they ruled the district for many centuries. Though forfeited at various periods, they still maintained possession of thousands of acres, peopled by an able-bodied tenantry with whom rights of prescription ranked higher than those of law, and who voluntarily yielded privileges of feudality which the statue-book refused to recognise. Thus their power and influence were so great, that in point of fact they were still Sovereigns of the vast tract, where they carried on piratical<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8325-00000043"/> and other lawless practices, with audacious success, though in defiance of the established Government of the country.</p> 
               <p>To the enlightened reader it must appear extraordinary that notwithstanding the well-known character of The O'Sullivan-Beare, and the mal-practices of which he had so long been justly suspected, he was yet a Magistrate of the county, though he did not possess one acre of ground in fee simple!</p> 
               <p>He had boldly declared that in accepting that office he performed an act of the greatest condescension, for that with the honorary sovereignty still attached to him, and the feudal devotion of his clansmen, he considered himself nearly as much a prince as any of his numerously-recorded ancestors. Under those circumstances, strange must have been the principle that elected him to the office we have named. Such, however, was the fact; and thus the popular power which his retainers considered the hereditary privilege of his ancient race was to a certain extent connived at, if not fostered, by the Government against which its attacks were uniformly directed.</p> 
               <p>The other misdeeds, real and imputed, of The O'Sullivan-Beare fell so far short of his recent crime, that they were comparatively forgotten in the general anxiety to avenge it. In the pursuit of this one object, a storm of popular indignation burst forth upon the perpetrator with a sudden violence for which he was not prepared.</p> 
               <p>The civil and military authorities were consequently on the alert for his immediate apprehension, as well as for that of all persons privy to the horrid deed.</p> 
               <p>For weeks their effort to attain this object had been unsuccessful, but private information from what had been deemed an authentic source determined Ogilvie and Fitzmorris to proceed with a large body of soldiers to the peninsula which forms the Baronies of Bear and Bantry, it having been confidently stated that the Irish insurgent had adjourned there with several of his most powerful and devoted adherents.</p> 
               <p>This peninsula projects into the Atlantic Ocean to a distance of forty miles.</p> 
               <p>It is, in fact, a continuation of a chain of mountains that run from Macroom and end near Dursey Island, which is only separated from the mainland by a narrow but deep channel, through which an impetuous current rushes. On this mainland, which terminates abruptly, a junior branch of the O'Sullivan family has resided time immemorial, at a place called Garanish. This place had been for many years noted for smuggling, and at the period of our tale was inaccessible except by boat, or on the back of a mountain-pony accustomed to clamber over precipices, or to struggle through bogs, thirty miles of pathway presenting equal difficulties.</p> 
               <p>Having with infinite fatigue vainly scoured this wild district Ogilvie resolved to proceed four miles higher up, to a harbor called Lahanabeg, which was the last hold of the Spaniards in Ireland, and where in former days they had a fishing establishment of some consequence.</p> 
               <p>The patience of the magistrate and that of his military escort was nearly exhausted when, after an arduous search through the region of Garanish, they again failed in the object of their search.</p> 
               <p>Almost despairing of success, they were on the point of retracing their route, when suddenly a ruffian-like man sprang, round the angle of an adjacent mountain, and fixed his eyes, gleaming with some sinister purpose, full on the face of Ogilvie, while, darting to his side, he whispered a request to speak a few important words beyond the hearing of the soldiers.</p> 
               <p>The noblemen shook himself free from the hold this stranger had taken of his arm, and made a step backward, as he sternly said-</p> 
               <p>"Fellow, speak out! This is a magistrate, nothing you have to say to me can need concealment."</p> 
               <p>The man shook his head without reply, and turning then to Fitzmorris, he hissed into his ear.</p> 
               <p>"I'm ready to turn King's evidence and bethray <emph>him</emph> y're sarching for-The O'Sulivan-Beare-into your clutches!"</p> 
               <p>"Hah!" said the magistrate, scowling a look of suspicion,-"and pray who are <emph>you?</emph>" he added after a pause of some minutes, and in an under tone.</p> 
               <p>"Misther Scully-at your sarvice!-now the retainer of<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8325-00000044"/> Murty Oge O'Sullivan, but able an' willin' to let you and your Sassenachs into the Lion's din, if well rewarded for the bloody work," retorted the scoundrel from between his set teeth while quickly he brought a hugh cutlass, concealed beneath his "wrap-rascal"-as the cloaks of the lower Irish were then called-to the level of the Magistrate's side, at the same time dexterously hiding the gleaming blade from the military, who were somewhat in advance, while he muttered in a deeper voice, and with a powerful aspiration, "I promise <emph>that</emph> an' anything-everything if you thrate me well. If <emph>not</emph>-by the sowl of my father you and the young lord are both dead men!"</p> 
               <p>Not from fear, Fitzmorris signified his readiness to receive the proffered evidence, and after a brief parley, during which the informer's conditions were accepted, Scully communicated the retreat of The O'Sullivan, and declared his readiness to admit the soldiers there, by treachery, that night.</p> 
               <p>This promise was sealed by a solemn oath, and, the traitor again concealed his cutlass within the folds of his "wrap-rascal." Then, giving brief but comprehensive directions for the most speedy and practicable route to Quolagh, a residence of The O'Sullivans, where he stated that their Chief, wearied of lurking in more secret places, had taken refuge with his Clansmen, Scully whispered the necessity of gaining it ere his own absence caused suspicion.</p> 
               <p>No sooner were those words breathed, than, with the agility of a hare, the ruffian darted up a path that wound along a dark chasm, which no foot less practised than his own could possibly have trod, and almost instantly disappeared among the sinuosities of the opposite range of mountains.</p> 
               <p>The whole of this scene had taken less time to enact than it has done to describe; and when it was announced to the military that, at length, they had discovered the retreat of the redoubted Chieftain, a shout of triumph testified their eagerness to reach it without questioning or delay.</p> 
               <p>The men therefore, having got their orders, moved onwards to the scene of action, stepping out in as gallant style as a tiresome succession of steep ascents, extensive bogs, and mountain-paths permitted. Having forced their way for many miles through toilsome and often dangerous difficulties, the retreat of the O'Sullivan Beare appeared in sight as the soldiers suddenly turned round the projection of a huge mountain, hung with luxuriant forest trees.</p> 
               <p>An aspect of even unusual solitude surrounded the old house of Quolagh, which, though distinctly visible, still lay at a little distance from the party, who halted by order of their commanding officer.</p> 
               <p>The old castellated house of Quolagh was of the rudest form of architecture, and massive in structure. The building was partially fortified, so that an obstinate defence might be expected.</p> 
               <p>The dell opened out from the sides of the old building, gradually becoming more and more extensive as it sloped towards the spot where the party remained almost immoveable and screened from observation, as they watched the pageant of the heavens fade away. At first, the eye perceived no outlet to the stretch the vale afforded, excepting that which the military had just passed; for huge rocks interspersed among oaks, birch, and fir, not only girded the back of the house, in a manner which appeared to allow no egress from it, but protruded from either side in a sort of semi-circle, here and there so broken into detached masses that it was only through vistas thus formed that glimpses of The O'Sullivan's retreat could be caught.</p> 
               <p>The steps of the party were, as we have already stated, arrested as they gazed on this singular place, and their senior officer, who had mused more on the fittest mode of action for a successful attack on the O'Sullivan-Beare than on his picturesque abode, now, after a short consultation with Fitzmorris resolved to conceal his men cautiously among the trees and behind the ledge of rocks they had just passed. This precaution he justly calculated would allow them to rest and take refreshment until the midnight hour, which the recreant Scully had appointed as the most advisable for their projected enterprise.</p> 
               <p>The whole party then silently retreated to their selected<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8325-00000045"/> shelter, which they reached without incurring observation. As midnight advanced, the soldiers, recruited by sleep and the refreshment they had carried in their wallets, became almost uncontrollably impatient to proceed to the attack. The moon had risen, but thick clouds, flitting through the sky, at times eclipsed her light, while at others it shone out brilliantly and revealed the glorious mountains, woods, and silver stream, distinctly flinging the shadows of the rocks and knolls across the glen, until, to a poetical fancy, it might seem peopled with mysterious shapes, as if the Spirits of mischief were indeed abroad.</p> 
               <p>The most obvious method for surprising the house was to proceed towards it as cautiously as possible, and orders having been given to that effect, the whole party at the whispered word of command stealthily advanced.</p> 
               <p>As if to favour their design, the luminary of the night at this moment veiled herself beneath a mantle of impervious clouds, and the few stars that remained to gleam throughout the sky afforded a faint, but sufficient light to guide the steps of men who, under stronger radiance, had previously decided on their line of march.</p> 
               <p>Without discovery the Military reached the high arched entrance to the main court of Quolagh House, and halting there the signal pre-concerted between Fitzmorris and his Informer, was warily given. As if by invisible hands, the large knobbed portal immediately and slowly opened. Scully, skulking behind the ranks of the soldiers who silently poured into the Court, pointed to the turret window of the chamber where The O'Sullivan slept, and then emphatically whispered-</p> 
               <p>"Whist!-brathe-stir not a fut till I get inside o' the house, where I'll do yit more to help yees, for by dad an' by dad, I've wetted the powdher iv all the pistols an' guns, an' signs on, they'll niver go off the whiff iv a pipe! an' as to the boys that played Sintenels, why they're as good as stone dead wid the stuff that I putt, unknownst to thim all, in their dhrink this blessed night."</p> 
               <p>As Scully whispered these words, which, even at such a moment, were accompanied by the low chuckle of successful villany, he took a pass-key from his pocket, unlocked the door of the house, and leaving it open for the entrance of the soldiers, sprang up the stairs. The next moment he appeared half-dressed on the old battlements as if just startled from his sleep, and shouting, as he crossed and thumped his breast-</p> 
               <p>"Allilu! Allilu! murdher alive! the army's down upon us! Lord Ogilvie and the army!"</p> 
               <p>The cry was scarcely uttered when from all quarters The O'Sullivan's adherents rushed to the battlements; some half-naked, had caught up their formidable cutlasses, but the majority having meant to go upon a secret enterprise at day-break, had slept in their clothes, and now, full armed, sprang in fury to the scene of action.</p> 
               <p>For a moment high above his Clansmen. The O'Sullivan-Beare appeared upon the lonely turret-top, the moon at the same instant shining brightly forth, as if to light him into view. He stopped but a second to gird on his cutlass and pistols; then flashing a tremendous broad-sword above his head, he rushed to the battlements, now crowded with friends and foes; and thundering forth-"At, at them, boys! At them for life or death!" he attacked right and left, with such fury, that every stroke told with fatal effect. As but a small body of the miltary could clamber up the narrow staircase, by far the largest portion filled the main court-yard below, perceiving which, and seeing that the soldiers were in the act of taking deliberate aim, The O'Sullivan in a voice hoarse with rage ejaculated,-</p> 
               <p>"Fire the guns!-Fire on the Sassenachs, and welcome them with shot!"</p> 
               <p>Suiting the action to the word, he drew a pistol from his belt, and rapidly levelled it.</p> 
               <p>The attempted discharge was made in vain;-grinding his teeth in astonishment and fury, The O'Sullivan tried to fire another, but with equally bad success.</p> 
               <p>"There's treason in the House!" roared the baffled Chief, at once perceiving that neither his guns nor the pistols of his men could fire: "our pieces have been wetted by a traitor's hand!"-then uttering one fearful curse, while even his eyeless<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8325-00000046"/> less socket seemed to gleam in fury, he dashed his pistol to the earth, and resuming his broadsword, rushed to the thickest of the fight.</p> 
               <p>On hearing their Chieftain's words, there was a desperate cry for revenge from his followers, which was as furiously reiterated by the English soldiers, when, having discovered another staircase, they endeavered to crowd in, inspired with fresh hope.</p> 
               <p>At the head of those steps The O'Sullivan-Beare deliberately took his stand, attacking, with almost insane valor, the advancing foes, who were animated by a spirit as brave and daring as his own.</p> 
               <p>His faithful and undaunted Clansmen covered the rear like a human wall, some facing and fighting the Military who had gained the battlements by the eastern stair, others turning towards and attacking the soldiers who had resolutely mounted the western one, thus forming two distinct divisions. They had just executed this movement when Scully escaped unobserved to the English magistrate, who stood in the main court, within the shelter of one of the low-browed arches of the cloisters, which, overshadowed by a spreading tree, concealed him from all other eyes than those of the informer, while he watched the progress of the fight.</p> 
               <p>In few and rapid words Scully, as screened from view as his anxious auditor, suggested that the only chance of achieving the capture of The O'Sullivan alive (which was the grand object of the Government) consisted in forcing him to quit his house by firing it.</p> 
               <p>This, if Fitzmorris wished, the scoundrel, undertook to do. The magistrate instantly consented to the scheme, certain that nothing else could force. The Chief from his present position which, if once effected, he thought must be followed by his capture in the main court, by the large body of soldiers that filled it.</p> 
               <p>Scully waited no further parley, but rushing, still unobserved, to a part of the house that was totally deserted, he fired the train he had previously laid.</p> 
               <p>Meanwhile, the redoubted Chief, firm, resolute, and desperate not only maintained his perilous post, but repulsed his vigorous asssilants with astonishing effect.</p> 
               <p>Whirling his broadsword round him with fearful sweeps, he had already cut down many of the foremost soldiers, who tried to force a passage up the narrow stair; but others still poured in, while the pistol shots aimed at Murty Oge had glided harmlessly by him and given death-wounds to several of his followers.</p> 
               <p>As he witnessed this, and heard of the carnage successfully carried on by the English soldiers on the western division of his men, The O'Sullivan's efforts became absolutely frantic.</p> 
               <p>A volley of curses mingled with the orders that flew from his foaming mouth, and the torches waving and flickering here and there by the inferiors of his household gave the muscular breadth of The O'Sullivan's figure distinctly to the view, looking as something scarcely of this earth, so appalling was the concentrated rage that worked within. Drawing his breath hard, the rugged features and blazing eye of the Irish Chief assumed the aspect of a demon.</p> 
               <p>Setting his teeth, as if steeled for a sudden master-stroke of vengeance, he threw himself slightly back to give gigantic force to the tiger-spring he meditated, when, at the same instant, smothering shrieks of "Fire! fire!" issued from all quarters. Amid accumulated terrors, the firm, unyielding figure of The O'Sullivan-Beare was seen opposing thews and sinews to his foes; every muscle tightened to superhuman exertion as he shouted to his men to follow-him while laboring to gain a low-arched door in the centre of the battlements. He laughed a fierce laugh as the door flew open and revealed a private flight of stone steps so narrow that only a single man could possibly go down them.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan forced his followers to escape the burning death by descending this ancient stair, which gave access to the intricate windings of the mountain-paths behind his house.</p> 
               <p>As apparently the last of his men sprang down the stair, the Chief, through his firmly set teeth, muttered a thanksgiving.</p> 
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8325-00000047"/> 
               <p>Yielding to the solicitations of his friends, and more in the hope of saving their lives than his own, he went after them down the stair, and succeeded in gaining the rear of his house.</p> 
               <p>There a high wall opposed his progress, but no obstacle could daunt the spirit of the Chief, and he was in the act of leaping when the contents of a pistol ploughed through his scalp, and the following instant, with a heavy sound, The O'Sullivan-Beare dropped senseless at the feet of his Clansmen!</p> 
               <p>All had passed with the quickness of lightning, and as rapid were the movements by which the Chief was dragged away from the faithful Clansmen, and borne to a distance from the tottering pile of soldiers, who, thus hazarded their lives.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely had this group gained a spot of comparative safety-previously reached by Fitzmorris and the remnant of the military-than the Old House of Quolagh fell with a fearful crash.</p>

               <p>We will not tire the reader with a detail of the various acts-misnamed a trial-that followed the capture of the redoubtable O'Sullivan.</p> 
               <p>Suffice it that he was formally tried, condemned and sentenced to be hung.</p> 
               <p>When the day of doom arrived the O'Sullivan was the first to tread the platform.</p> 
               <p>Dan Connell walked closely after his chief, whose example he followed by instantly mounting the fatal stool, on which the Irish Buccaneers now stood side by side.</p> 
               <p>The O'Sullivan's lip curled into something between a sneer and a smile of triumph. Then suddenly he uplifted his fettered arms to the utmost height their manacles permitted, and ejaculated in a loud, unfaltering voice that was heard in the remotest corner of the crowd,-</p> 
               <p>"By the blood of the Sea-Kings that flows through our veins, we have nought to confess but <emph>this:</emph>-We die-as we have lived, and as the race of <foreign xml:lang="GAI">Colla</foreign> ought to live-the foes of Tyranny and U surpation-the true-born Lovers of our Country try-the Ocean-Sons of Liberty-<emph>The</emph> Irish Buccaneers!-somsman, we are ready!"-A confusion of sounds arose from the assembled multitude, despite of which the Executioner <unclear>constantly</unclear> advanced. He adjusted the ropes round the necks of the prisoners, preparatory to putting the white cap upon each! He turned round to receive those last fatal ensigns from his assistant, and in that brief moment. The O'Sullivan shouted in a voice of thunder, appalling in its wrath, "Bloodhounds! to base-born hangman gives OUR doom-into the unknown world <emph>we</emph> launch ourselves!" And suiting the action to the word with such rapidity that prevention was impracticable, he boldly kicked away the stool, which rolling from beneath their feet, both prisoners, with uncovered faces hung suspended from the ropes!</p> 
               <p>As the crowd witnessed this unexpected and energetic manuvre, tremendous cheers and cries burst forth from various quarters, and, notwithstanding the great strength of the barriers, the pressure of the people was so terrific, that several of the barricades gave way, while others were actually torn up, and brandished successfully against the Military.</p> 
               <p>Amidst the flash of muskets and the charge of Cavalry, one united band, composed of the flower of the clan of The O'Sullivan, dashed resolutely on, with the fury of lions, felling down foes, and sometimes even friends, until they succeeded in mounting to the scaffold.</p> 
               <p>A long yell of despair which clove the air the next instant-issuing from the hearts of this devoted party-announced to the field that they came too late, for the Irish Buccaneers were indeed no more!</p> 
               <p>It was responded to by a cry so intensely savage, that it actually thrilled to the marrow and the bones of those upon whose ears it smote.</p> 
               <p>In the noiseless solitude of that forest-land, laid side by side within a mountain-tombin their beloved Ivera, The O'Sullivan and Daniel Connell found their last resting-place on earth!</p> 
               <p>The oaths of future vengeance which, at that wild, midnight burial, burst from bleeding Clansmen over the grave of the dead, were mingled with the wailings of the everlasting sea,<pb n="100" xml:id="VAC8325-00000048"/> that girdled its base, and rang forth to the vault of Heaven awful requiem of The Irish Buccaneers!</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>On the death of Murty, Eva was not only restored to freedom, and made happy by her union with Ogilvie; but one the Buccaneer's most devoted clansmen revealed the secret Eva's parentage. Her mother was an Irish lady of his rank, who had been secretly married to Charles Edward Stuart O'Sullivan had become possessed of the secret. His tower ambition and fierce love had incited him to try to become husband of this fair daughter of a kingly house.</p> 
               <p>Let many years roll rapidly away!</p> 
               <p>The sweet thoughtfulness engendered by sad <unclear>reveries</unclear> subdued the sensibilities of Lady Ogilvie (our "Eva") an increased the domestic happiness which was her portion.</p> 
               <p>Not unfrequently withdrawing from home-scenes so <unclear>pure</unclear> and blissful that she almost feared they <emph>would</emph> not last, a loved to retire to meditation and to solemn silence at the Grave of Charles Edward!</p> 
               <p>With those holy thoughts the memories of her own chequered life would sometimes mingle;-a life which had been so singularly bound up with the events which decided the fate of The O'Sullivan.</p> 
               <p>The now faded Banner placed by surviving friends above the Tomb of Charles Edward Stuart, as it arrested the tearful gaze of Lady Ogilvie, brought before her mental vision not only the departed glories of a Royal Race, but also, by a mysterious association, recalled those painful incidents in her own destiny which were so linked with the wild and terrible history of The Irish Buccaneers.</p>
