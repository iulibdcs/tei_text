               <head>The Pet Beauty.</head>
               <p>MR. HORTON, a rich and childless widower, made his first visit to his also widowed
                  sister, Mrs. Dushane. A beautiful little girl of about ten, was introduced to him
                  as the <emph>darling Clara,</emph> his little pet niece, who was prepared to love
                  her uncle better than any body else in the world, always excepting her mamma. The
                  child was remarkably beautiful, and all the decorations of dress were made to
                  enhance her juvenile loveliness. The heart of the lonely man melted within him
                  when he felt his neck wreathed by those white velvet arms, and his cheek kissed
                  over and over by those sweet ruby lips.</p>
               <p>"God bless her!" cried he, hugging her to his breast, again and again. "What a
                  precious child it is!"</p>
               <p>"I love you, dear uncle," muttered Clara, in the softest voice—"I have loved you a
                  long time."</p>
               <p>Mr. Horton gave the lovely child another warm embrace, then, releasing her, turned
                  to his sister, with moistened eyes.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6687-00000004"/>
               <p>"If Heaven had granted me such a child as that, sister, to cheer my widowed heart,
                  I should still be one of the happiest of men."</p>
               <p>"You must look upon her as if indeed she were your own, my dear brother," said
                  Mrs. Dushane, drawing Clara fondly towards her. "I am not so selfish as to wish to
                  engross her exclusively, though I acknowledge I have a mother's pride as well as
                  affection."</p>
               <p>"But you have another daughter, your eldest born—where is she? My heart yearns to
                  embrace them all. I came here to see if its aching void could not be filled."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Effie?" said Mrs. Dushane, carelessly. "I do not know where she is. She is
                  very shy and reserved—likes to be by herself—very different from Clara—remarkably
                  ordinary in her person," continued she, in a lower voice, "and has a very singular
                  and sullen disposition. She is a great affliction to me, but one cannot expect to
                  be blessed in all her children."</p>
               <p>"Still I want to see the child," said the benevolent Mr. Horton. "I loved her
                  father like my own brother, and he used to say his little girl was the image of
                  himself; I cannot help loving his daughter."</p>
               <p>"I fear you will not find much to love in poor Effie," replied the mother, with a
                  deep sigh; "but you shall see her;" then ringing the bell, she ordered a servant
                  to bring Miss Effie to her uncle.</p>
               <p>Soon after, a dark, thin, neglected-looking child was ushered into the room, who
                  hung back on the hand of the servant, and whose looks and gestures expressed
                  sullenness and reluctance. Her long, thick, dark hair hung in tangled masses over
                  her neck and forehead, and it was difficult to distinguish her features, for she
                  endeavoured to cover them with her hair, as with a veil. With slow steps and
                  averted face, she approached the centre of the room, when her mother called to her
                  in a tone of authority—</p>
               <p>"Put down your hand from your face, Effie, and come and speak to your
                  uncle—come—quicker."</p>
               <p>Effie looked at her uncle through her long tresses, then, letting her hand fall,
                  she drew nearer, with a more willing step.</p>
               <p>"Ah! that was her father's glance," exclaimed Mr. Horton, opening his arms as he
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>Effie hesitated a moment, then darted like lightning to his bosom, and clung round
                  his neck with both her arms, as if she would never let him go.</p>
               <p>"Effie," said her mother, reproachingly, "you are too rude—I did not tell you to
                  tear your uncle to pieces."</p>
               <p>"Let her be—let her be," said Mr. Horton, pushing back her hair, and looking
                  earnestly in her face. "Why her eyes are full of tears, and her heart beats as if
                  she had been running a race. Don't be afraid of me—I'm your uncle, who has no
                  little girl of his own to love; I want you to look upon me as a father."</p>
               <p>"That will do, Effie," said Mrs. Dushane; "you make your uncle too warm—come and
                  take a seat by me."</p>
               <p>Effie withdrew her arms from her uncle's neck, and, sliding from his knee, took
                  the seat indicated by her<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6687-00000005"/> mother's
                  glance. Mr. Horton's eyes were still riveted upon her face.</p>
               <p>"Is that child sick?" he asked, abruptly.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Mrs. Dushane—"she always has that meagre, half-famished look. She is
                  a great deal stronger than Clara."</p>
               <p>Mr. Horton did not reply, but looked earnestly at both children, while his sister
                  watched his countenance with silent interest. Mrs. Dushane had anticipated the
                  arrival of her brother with great anxiety. She knew the immense wealth he had
                  acquired—that he had no children of his own to inherit it—that she was his only
                  surviving sister, and she was sure that the moment he beheld her darling Clara, he
                  would adopt her as the heiress of his fortune.</p>
               <p>"My dear," said she to her, the morning of her brother's arrival, "you remember
                  how much I have told you of your Uncle Horton—your rich uncle. Now, though we have
                  a very decent living, that is all;—I shall be able to leave you nothing, but your
                  uncle is said to be worth a million—and, I have no doubt, will make you heiress to
                  the whole, if you only try to please him, and be a dear, sweet, beautiful child,
                  the whole time he is here."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I will be sure to please him," cried Clara, dancing before the looking-glass.
                  "Ill please him without trying."</p>
               <p>"How are you sure of that, darling?" asked the mother.</p>
               <p>"Oh, because I am so pretty," replied the spoiled child, shaking back the ringlets
                  from her bright blue eyes, and looking archly in her mother's face. "You know
                  every body says I am pretty, mamma, and that sister is ugly."</p>
               <p>"Yes—but you must not repeat what every body says before your uncle, for he would
                  not be pleased if he thought you vain—and you must be very polite and affectionate
                  to him—get in his lap, put your arms around his neck, and caress him a great deal.
                  You must never get in a passion before him, for it spoils your looks; you know, my
                  dear, you are too apt to do it. You must be very attentive to him when he is
                  speaking, and be sure never to contradict him. I recollect it always displeased
                  him to be interrupted in conversation."</p>
               <p>"I hope he will not stay long, if I've got to listen to him all the time," said
                  Clara, "for I know he must be a dry old thing."</p>
               <p>"You will not think a million of dollars dry, one of these days," said Mrs.
                  Dushane—"but never mind, perhaps he will leave it to Effie."</p>
               <p>"To Effie!" exclaimed Clara, with a laugh of derision. "To Effie! the ugly
                  thing?—Oh, no! I'm not afraid of her. You see if I don't please uncle, without
                  trying very hard either."</p>
               <p>A servant, whose chief employment was to wait upon Clara, was full two hours
                  curling her hair and arranging her dress, before the arrival of Mr. Horton, and
                  when the business of the toilette was over, she led her in triumph to her mother,
                  asking her "if Miss Clara did not look like a perfect angel!"</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6687-00000006"/>
               <p>A rapturous kiss on her roseate cheek was an expressive answer in the
                  affirmative.</p>
               <p>"Oh! mamma, you tumble my frock," cried the little belle, in a pettish tone. "I
                  don't love to be squeezed."</p>
               <p>"Shall I change Miss Effie's dress?" asked the servant as she was leaving the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"It's of no consequence," said Mrs. Dushane, coldly: "she needn't come into the
                  room to-night. I'm ashamed my brother should see her," continued she, in a kind of
                  soliloquy; "she is so ugly, and awkward, and wayward, I want to keep her out of
                  his sight as long as possible."</p>
               <p>Mr. Horton had not been more than a week with his sister before he discovered
                  that, though she was the nominal head of the establishment, Miss Clara was the
                  real one, and that her varying whims and caprices were the laws that governed the
                  whole household. Effie seldom made her appearance, and then she seemed more like
                  an automaton than any thing else; never displaying any trait of that sensibility
                  which had so touched her uncle's heart the first night of his arrival. When
                  company was present, Clara was summoned to the piano to entertain the guests with
                  music, which she had been taught almost from her cradle; or she was called upon to
                  display her graceful little figure in the mazes of the hornpipe, or the
                  undulations of the shawl dance, which her master said she executed to
                  perfection.</p>
               <p>One evening Mr. Horton sat reading in an upper piazza which fronted the chamber he
                  occupied. It was shaded by luxurious vines, which trailed their flowery tendrils
                  through the diamond trellis-work and excluded the rays of the setting sun.
                  Embowered in the rich shades, he sat unseen, enjoying the sweetness and freshness
                  of declining day. He heard the voices of the children in the adjoining room, and
                  he could not but notice that Clara's tones wanted something of the dulcet softness
                  of her parlour accents. He had scarcely ever heard the full sound of Effie's
                  voice, and he now listened unconsciously to a conversation which promised to
                  develope her character to a most interested auditor.</p>
               <p>"Don't, Clara, press so hard against this geranium," said Effie, in an
                  expostulating tone; "you know mother will be very angry if it is broken."</p>
               <p>"I don't care," replied Clara, evidently persisting in her conduct; "she will not
                  be angry with me."</p>
               <p>"But she will with me," said Effie, "for I have the care of this flower, and if
                  any harm happens to it, she will blame me. You've broken off several leaves
                  already."</p>
               <p>There was a moment's silence, and then a sudden and vehement exclamation from
                  Effie again roused the attention of Mr. Horton.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Clara, see what you've done! The most beautiful branch is broken—and you did
                  it on purpose too!"</p>
               <p>Clara laughed mockingly, and at the same moment Mrs. Dushane was heard to enter
                  the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Effie! Effie!" exclaimed she angrily, "what have you been doing? How dare you
                  break that geranium<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6687-00000007"/> nium, when I've
                  forbidden you to touch a single leaf of it?"</p>
               <p>"I didn't break it, mother!" answered Effie. "I wouldn't have broken it for any
                  thing in the world."</p>
               <p>"How dare you deny it, when you are holding it in your own hand, you
                  good-for-nothing little thing?" cried the mother, with increasing anger. "I
                  suppose you want to make me think that Clara broke it—don't you?"</p>
               <p>"Clara did break it!" sobbed Effie; "she knows she did, and I tried to keep her
                  from it."</p>
               <p>"Oh! mamma, I didn't do any such thing!" cried Clara, with the boldness of
                  innocence itself—"you know I wouldn't."</p>
               <p>"I could forgive you for breaking the flower," exclaimed Mrs. Dushane, in the
                  husky voice of suppressed passion, "but tell such another lie on Clara, and you
                  had better never have been born."</p>
               <p>Mr. Horton started from his seat in uncontrollable agitation, dropped his book,
                  and rushed to the open door of the apartment just as Effie, smitten by a violent
                  blow, had fallen prostrate to the floor, her hand still grasping the broken
                  geranium, whose leaves were scattered around her.</p>
               <p>"Clarinda!" cried Mr. Horton, sternly, "unjust, unnatural woman—what have you
                  done?"</p>
               <p>"She is a liar, brother, and I struck her. She deserved it," answered Mrs.
                  Dushane, pale with anger.</p>
               <p>"She is not a liar, and I know it," answered he, in a raised voice. "There stands
                  the liar!" pointing to the now terrified and guilty-looking Clara. "I heard every
                  thing that passed between them. She broke the flower wantonly, purposely, against
                  her sister's prayers she broke it, and then basely denies it. Rise, my poor
                  child," continued he, trying to lift Effie from the ground; "you shall have one
                  friend to protect you, if your own mother casts you from her."</p>
               <p>Effie was only stunned by the fall, and when she found herself in the arms of Mr.
                  Horton, she struggled to be released.</p>
               <p>"Oh! let me go," cried she, almost frantically—"she will hate me worse than ever.
                  Oh! how I wish I was dead! how I wish I was dead!"</p>
               <p>There was something terrible in the expression of the child's large, dilated black
                  eyes, as, in a wild paroxysm of passion, she repeated this fearful ejaculation.
                  Mr. Horton shuddered, but he only held her the more closely.</p>
               <p>"Clarinda," said he, solemnly, "you have that to answer for which will weigh like
                  iron upon your soul at the great judgment day. What has this poor, neglected child
                  done, that you treat her worse than an hireling, and lavish all your affection on
                  that selfish and unprincipled girl?"</p>
               <p>"Clara," said her mother, "leave the room instantly. This is no place for you. Why
                  do you not obey me?"</p>
               <p>Clara began to weep bitterly, but her mother took her by the hand, and leading her
                  to the door, gave her in charge to a servant, with a whispered injunction not
                  intended for her brother's ear.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6687-00000008"/>
               <p>"Now let <emph>that</emph> child go," said she. "If I am to be arraigned for my
                  conduct, I don't want any listeners. Effie, follow your sister, and mind that
                  there is no more quarrelling."</p>
               <p>"She shall not go," cried Mr. Horton. "I fear that there is no safety for her out
                  of my arms. Clarinda, I cannot believe the cruel, unjust, and unnatural mother I
                  see before me, is the sister whom I remember in the spring-time of the heart's
                  feeling, and in the gentleness of early womanhood."</p>
               <p>"Brother, if you wish me to speak, let that child go. I will not be humbled before
                  her, or any human being."</p>
               <p>"Yes, let me go," said Effie, again struggling. "I don't want to stay here."</p>
               <p>"One question, first," said Mr. Horton. "Tell me truly, why you wished yourself
                  dead?"</p>
               <p>"Because every body hates me."</p>
               <p>"And what makes you think every body hates you?"</p>
               <p>"Because I am ugly," cried the child, in a low, bitter tone, looking darkly and
                  sullenly at her mother.</p>
               <p>"I will love you, Effie, if you are good, as well as if you were my own child. But
                  you must not give way to such violent passions. Be gentle, if you wish to be
                  loved. Be gentle, if you wish to be beautiful."</p>
               <p>He put her down from his knee, where he had seated her, and motioned that she
                  might depart. She stood for a moment as if irresolute, then threw her arms around
                  his neck, kissed his cheeks, his hands, and even the sleeves of his garment, in a
                  most passionate manner, and ran out of the room.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Clarinda," cried he, greatly moved, "what a heart you are throwing away from
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"To me she has always been sullen and cold," said Mrs. Dushane; "she has never
                  shown me any affection, but, on the contrary, the greatest dislike."</p>
               <p>"Because the fountain of her young affections has been frozen, and her young blood
                  turned to gall," replied her brother. "She has been brought up with the withering
                  conviction that she is an object of hatred and disgust to those around her, placed
                  in glaring comparison with her beautiful sister, treated like a menial, her dress
                  neglected, her manners uncultivated, and her sensibilities crushed and trodden
                  under foot. Talk about her affections! You might as well take those very geranium
                  leaves, and grind them with your heel, till you have bruised out all their
                  fragrance, and then murmur that they gave you back no sweetness. But that child
                  has affections, warm, glowing affections, though you have never elicited them—and
                  a mind, too, though you have never cultivated it; but if God grant me the
                  opportunity, I will take possession of the unweeded wilderness of her heart and
                  mind, and turn it into a blooming, domestic garden yet."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dushane was thunderstruck. She saw in prospective her darling Clara
                  disinherited, and she knew not in what way to avert the impending calamity.</p>
               <p>"Brother," cried she, putting her handkerchief to her eyes, "you are strangely
                  altered. You used to<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6687-00000009"/> love me once, but
                  now the stranger within my gates would treat me with more kindness. You don't know
                  what provocations I have, or you would not accuse me of such cruelty and
                  injustice."</p>
               <p>"You forget, Clarinda, that I have been a witness myself of your injustice. I do
                  not make accusations, but appeal to self-evident truths—and did you not suffer
                  Clara to depart, without once rebuking her for her falsehood and guilt?"</p>
               <p>"Brother, I believe you hate Clara."</p>
               <p>"I have no love for her faults, and to speak the honest truth, I never liked
                     <emph>favourites.</emph> From the time of ancient Joseph's coat of many
                  colours, which excited the envy and hatred of his brethren, to our days of modern
                  refinement, favouriteism has been the fruitful source of sin and sorrow, and
                  oftentimes of blood and death. Do not accuse me of unkindness, Clarinda, because I
                  speak strongly of the evils you have caused. I would rouse you to a sense of your
                  danger, and place before you, in all their length and breadth, the sacred duties
                  you have too long neglected."</p>
               <p>"I may have been wrong," cried Mrs. Dushane, apparently softening; "indeed, I know
                  I have been, but I never could govern Effie in any other way than by severity. She
                  is the most singular child you ever saw, and you are the only person who ever
                  seemed to love her. You remember, brother, when I was a young girl, I was very
                  much admired for my beauty, and perhaps was led to attach an undue value to it. My
                  greatest ambition was to have a beautiful infant, and when Effie was said to be so
                  remarkably ugly, I could not help it, but my heart seemed steeled against her; and
                  she was a very cross infant, too, and cried day and night. I could hear the nurse
                  calling her a cross, ugly thing, till I was ashamed to have her in my sight. Then
                  Clara was so uncommonly beautiful, and such a sweet, smiling, bewitching little
                  infant, I could not help idolising her. Every body called her an angel, and indeed
                  you must acknowledge she has the beauty of one. Then she is so affectionate and
                  loving. You don't know how she twines around one's heart. To be sure, she was very
                  wrong just now, very wrong; but pray forgive her this one fault. You saw how
                  bitterly she wept. It was only the dread of your displeasure. You have no idea how
                  tenderly she loves you. Forgive Clara, for my sake, and I will be kind to Effie
                  for yours."</p>
               <p>"For your own sake, my beloved sister," said Mr. Horton, seating himself by her
                  side, and taking her hand affectionately in his. "The consciousness of a fault, is
                  one step to reformation. Only cultivate a mother's feelings for Effie, and,
                  believe me, you will be repaid for all your care."</p>
               <p>Late that evening, as Mr. Horton was walking pensively in the garden, whose walks
                  and arbours were partially illumined by the light of a waning moon, he was
                  attracted by a dark object under one of the trees. Supposing it some animal, which
                  had gained unlawful admittance, he approached to drive it from the enclosure, when
                  he was startled by the appearance of two large black eyes turned upwards to the
                  heavens, flashing out from a cloud of gipsy-looking hair.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6687-00000010"/>
               <p>"Effie," cried he, "what are you doing here so late, and alone?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing," replied she, springing on her feet; "I was only looking at the moon and
                  stars."</p>
               <p>"You had better go and look at them through your bed-curtains," said he, passing
                  his hand over her dew-damp hair; "it is time for little girls to be in bed and
                  asleep."</p>
               <p>"I cannot sleep so soon," said the child; "I think too much, and I wish too
                  much."</p>
               <p>"What is it you wish so much, Effie?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I wish to be up among the stars, out of the way of every body here; and then
                  they look as if they love me, with their sweet, bright eyes."</p>
               <p>Mr. Horton took her hand, and led her slowly and gently along.</p>
               <p>"You seem to want to be loved, Effie?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes," answered she, with energy. "I would die to be loved only half as well
                  as Clara."</p>
               <p>"Well, listen to me, Effie, and I will tell you how you may be loved even better
                  than Clara. You must not think that it is only beautiful persons who are
                  loved."</p>
               <p>"But they hate me because I am ugly," interrupted Effie.</p>
               <p>"You are not ugly, my child, and as you grow older, you will grow handsomer. But
                  you must forget your looks, and think of cultivating your mind and heart. You must
                  try to be loved for something better than beauty, and beauty perhaps will come,
                  without thinking of it."</p>
               <p>Effie looked up to him with a smile which really had a beautifying influence on
                  her face, seen by that soft moonlight.</p>
               <p>"If I could only be with <emph>you</emph> all the time," said she, "I should be
                  happy."</p>
               <p>"Would you, indeed, like to leave your home, and come and live with me?"</p>
               <p>"Would I?" cried she, suddenly stopping—"I would walk barefoot to the end of the
                  universe; I would feed on bread and water all my life, if I could only live near
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps we will live together one of these days," said he, smiling at her
                  enthusiasm, "but I will promise you better fare than bread and water. And now,
                  good night—and God bless you, my own darling Effie!"</p>
               <p>Effie retired to bed, but long after she laid her head upon her pillow, she
                  whispered to herself the endearing epithet, which had melted into her inmost
                  heart. It was the first time she had ever been so fondly addressed, and even in
                  her dreams she thought a gentle voice was murmuring in her ear, "my own darling
                  Effie!" Oh! how sweet to the neglected, lone-hearted child, was the language of
                  sympathy and love! It was like the gurgling fountain in the arid desert—the
                  nightingale in the dungeon's solitude—the gentle gale that first wakened the wild
                  music of her soul. It seemed that till that moment there had been a chill weight
                  of lead in her bosom, cold and deadening, but that it was now fused in the glowing
                  warmth of love, and flowing in one stream of affection,<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000011"/> reverence, gratitude, and almost worship, to the
                  feet of her benefactor and friend.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Horton proposed to his sister to take Effie home with him, she could not
                  disguise her mortification and displeasure. Effie, the heiress of her uncle's
                  fortune, to the exclusion of Clara, was a circumstance too intolerable to be
                  endured. The ugly Effie chosen in preference to the beautiful Clara! She would
                  gladly have refused the request, but she knew not what plea to urge against it.
                  She had herself acknowledged her unnatural dislike to the child, and her neglect
                  of all a mother's duties towards it was a too evident truth. In vain she sought to
                  stifle the voice of upbraiding conscience. It would be heard, even amidst the
                  whirlwind of passion that raged in her breast. Mr. Horton's determination was to
                  remove Effie as far as possible from the associations of her childhood, to place
                  her at school, where she could have every opportunity for the development of her
                  talents, and the discipline of her character—and then, if she fulfilled his hopes,
                  to adopt her as his own, and make her the heiress of his fortune, and the
                  inheritor of his name.</p>
               <p>Clara was outrageous when she learned the new destiny of her sister. She pouted,
                  wept, and stamped, in the impotence of her wrath. Effie should not go home with
                  her uncle, and get all his money, a whole million of dollars, away from her. She
                  didn't want to be pretty any more. She wished she were ugly. She would be ugly, if
                  it were only to spite her mamma, because she had not made her uncle like her
                  better than Effie.</p>
               <p>Her mother, instead of soothing and petting her with the halcyon strains of
                  flattery, as she was wont to do when her favourite got up a domestic storm, now
                  vented upon her the anger she dared not manifest before her brother.</p>
               <p>"It was your own fault," said she, "you spoiled, ungrateful child; you broke my
                  geranium, and then meanly lied about it. You had better not wish yourself ugly,
                  for you will have nothing but your beauty to depend upon, when you grow up. Not a
                  cent of money will you have for a fortune, while your sister will be an heiress
                  and—a belle—"</p>
               <p>"I don't care," cried Clara, scornfully pouting her rose-leaf lips. "I'll be a
                  belle too; and I don't want a fortune. I'll marry somebody with a great big
                  fortune, and you sha'n't live with me, either, Madame Mamma."</p>
               <p>Clara's appellation for her mother, in moments of passion, was "Madame Mamma;" and
                  Madame Mamma began to feel a foretaste of the anguish caused by that "sharper than
                  a serpent's tooth," the tongue of a thankless child.</p>
               <p>Having depicted a few scenes in the childhood of the two sisters, and shown the
                  different influences, emanating from the same source, which operated in the
                  characters of both, the lapse of a few years may be imagined, and those who have
                  become interested in the <emph>ugly Effie,</emph> may see her once more in the
                  period of adolescence—when released from the discipline of a<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000012"/> school, she fills a daughter's place in her uncle's
                  household. The mansion of Mr. Horton was such as became his princely fortune. It
                  was on a lordly scale, and presented an elegance of architecture and refinement of
                  taste unequalled in that part of the country where he resided. It was shaded on
                  all sides by magnificent trees, and a smooth lawn stretched out in front,
                  intersected by an avenue of symmetrical poplars, and surrounded by a hedge of
                  perennial shrubs. Underneath one of the trees that shadowed the walls, and looking
                  out on this rich, velvet lawn, sat the benevolent owner of this noble
                  establishment, whose dignified person corresponded well with the other features of
                  the scenery. A young girl stood near him, holding a bow in her left hand, and
                  watching the motions of a young man, who was feathering an arrow fitted for that
                  sylvan bow. Her figure had scarcely attained its full height, but it had all the
                  rounded proportions and undulating outlines of early womanhood. Her head, covered
                  with short raven curls, gave her the appearance of a young Greek, but her clear,
                  dark complexion, of perfect softness and transparency, assimilated her more to the
                  Creole race. Her features were not regular nor handsome in themselves, but they
                  were lighted up with animation and intellect, and illuminated by such large,
                  splendid black eyes, that it would have been difficult for the most fastidious
                  connoisseur of female beauty to have judged them with any severity of criticism.
                  From the bow, on which she partly leaned, the quiver suspended over her shoulder,
                  the wild grace of her attitude, and the darkness of her complexion, she might have
                  been mistaken for one of those daughters of the forest which American genius has
                  so often glowingly described.</p>
               <p>"That will do, Dudley," said she, playfully snatching the arrow, and fitting it to
                  her bow; "better reserve some of your skill to fledge your own arrows, for you
                  know I can shoot like Robin Hood himself."</p>
               <p>The young man laughed, and the trial of skill commenced. They shot alternately,
                  and scarcely had the gleaming arrow darted from the string, than they each pursued
                  its flight over the lawn, striving for the glory of first reaching the fallen
                  missile. At last the young girl hit the target in the very centre, and Mr. Horton
                  pronounced her the victor.</p>
               <p>"You must surrender, Dudley," said he; "there is no disgrace in yielding to
                  Effie—as swift a foot, as true an eye, and as steady a hand——"</p>
               <p>"And as warm a heart," interrupted she, approaching him with a cheek to which
                  exercise had given a colour like the coral under the wave, and seating herself on
                  the grass at his feet. "But what shall be my reward, dear uncle? In the merry days
                  of the 'Lion-hearted King,' the victor always received some crown, or trophy of
                  his skill or valour."</p>
               <p>While she was speaking, Dudley had been gathering some of the flowers and
                  perennial leaves of the shrubbery, and had woven them into a rustic garland,
                  which, sportively kneeling, he placed upon her brow.</p>
               <p>"I suppose, if I were versed in the language of<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000013"/> chivalry," said the youth, "I should address you as
                  the queen of love and beauty."</p>
               <p>"Beruty!" repeated Effie, with a laugh that made the green walks ring. "What would
                  my mother and Clara say if they heard such an appellation given to their ugly
                  Effie? You needn't look so mockingly, Dudley, for you may ask my uncle if, four
                  years ago, I wasn't the ugliest little gipsy he ever beheld."</p>
               <p>"You have, indeed, changed most marvellously, Effie," replied he, passing his hand
                  carelessly over the head that rested against his knee; "and you may thank the
                  daily exercise in the open air, which you have been compelled to take, for its
                  invigorating and beautifying influence."</p>
               <p>"I may thank, rather, the parental tenderness, the kindness, and the care, that
                  have been poured like balm into a bruised and wounded heart, healing and purifying
                  it, and changing, as it were, the very life-blood in my veins!" exclaimed Effie,
                  in her peculiarly impassioned manner. "Do you remember the night when you found me
                  under the sycamore tree, and called me your own darling Effie? From that moment I
                  date a new existence—from that moment life became dear to me, and oh! how dear,
                  how very dear it has been to me since!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Horton looked down upon her with glistening eyes, and blessed his God that it
                  had been his destiny to appropriate such rich treasures of intellect and
                  sensibility, and as he looked on the fair lands stretching around him, far as the
                  eye could reach, blessed Him again that he could now leave one behind him who was
                  worthy to be the mistress of those beautiful possessions. There was another pair
                  of brighter, younger eyes, looking down upon her, and wondering if it were
                  possible she had ever been called the "ugly Effie." Perhaps she read his thoughts,
                  for she smilingly said—</p>
               <p>"I wish you could see my sister Clara."</p>
               <p>"Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because she is so exquisitely fair—so faultlessly beautiful."</p>
               <p>"I do not like faultless beauties," replied he; "they are always insipid. I do not
                  like blondes—they have no expression. I like to see a face that changes with the
                  changing feelings—now dark, now bright, like the heavens bending above us."</p>
               <p>"Do you think your mother and sister would know you, Effie?" asked Mr. Horton.</p>
               <p>"I do not think they would," she replied, "for I sometimes hardly recognize
                  myself. I should like to see them as a stranger, to see what impressions I might
                  make. When shall I see them, dear uncle? Something whispers me I may yet be blest
                  with a mother's and a sister's love."</p>
               <p>"Are you not happy with me? Do you wish to leave me, Effie?"</p>
               <p>"Never!—I want no other home than this. But, in looking back, I blame myself so
                  much for the sullen and vindictive feelings I once dared to cherish. I tried so
                  little to deserve the love which was not spontaneously bestowed, I long to prove
                  to them that I am now not utterly unworthy of their regard."</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6687-00000014"/>
               <p>"I honour your wishes," said Mr. Horton, kindly; "and when we return from Europe
                  they shall be gratified. Two years will soon pass away. You will then have
                  acquired all the advantages of travelling in classic lands. Dudley will have
                  completed his education in the German universities, and in the freshness of
                  transatlantic graces, can present himself to your fair sister, whose beauty you
                  are so anxious he should admire."</p>
               <p>Dudley began to reiterate his detestation of blondes, but Mr. Horton interrupted
                  him to discuss more important matters.</p>
               <p>Dudley Alston was a ward of Mr. Horton's, the orphan son of the most intimate
                  friend of his youth. When his father died, he left him to the guardianship of Mr.
                  Horton, with the conditions that he should finish his education in Europe, and
                  that he should never marry without the consent of Mr. Horton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston had not been dead more than a year, so that Dudley had never seen Effie
                  in her chrysalis state. They had passed together their last vacation, and now
                  again met, free from all scholastic restraints, with spirits buoyant as young
                  singing birds, converting the still home of the widower into a bright scene of
                  youthful exercise and hilarity. Mr. Horton rejoiced in the circumstances which had
                  thrown so closely together these two congenial beings so dear to his affections,
                  and which promised to draw them together in closer and more endearing union.
                  Dudley was handsome, intelligent, and high-spirited; generous almost to
                  prodigality; unsuspicious almost to credulity dulity; impulsive and uncalculating,
                  and possessed of an independent fortune, free from any of those mortgages and
                  encumbrances which so often neutralize the property of reputed heirs. Where could
                  he find a husband for Effie, combining so many rare endowments, and where could
                  Dudley find a being like Effie, with a soul of fire, a heart of love, and a person
                  which he now thought singularly fascinating? He was too wise to speak his hopes,
                  but he thought it as impossible that their hearts should not grow together, as
                  that two young trees, placed side by side, should not interlace their green
                  boughs, and suffer their trembling leaves to unite. He wrote occasional letters to
                  his sister, and received from her cold and brief replies. She expatiated chiefly
                  on Clara's extraordinary beauty, and lamented her limited means to introduce her
                  to the world as she would wish—hoped that Effie was improving, but declared her
                  readiness to take her home, whenever her uncle was disgusted or weary of his
                  charge. Mr. Horton never made known to her the astonishing improvement in Effie's
                  appearance, for he wanted to dazzle her some day with the sudden lustre of the gem
                  she had thrown from her heart. He always mentioned her in vague terms, expressed
                  his general satisfaction in her good conduct, and approbation of her studious
                  habits. "As nature did not make her a beauty," said he, "I intend she shall be a
                  scholar, and no fear of her being called a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bas
                     bleu</foreign> shall prevent me from giving her a thoroughly classical
                  education. She is already familiar with Greek<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000015"/> and Latin, and during our European travels, she
                  shall become mistress of all the modern languages."</p>
               <p>"Oh! there is nothing so disgusting as a pedantic woman!" exclaimed Clara, with a
                  shudder, as her mother finished the perusal of the letter. "I know French and
                  Italian enough to sing all the fashionable songs and repeat all the common
                  quotations, and that is all a young lady requires. As for Greek and Latin, I
                  detest their very idea. But poor Effie needs something to distinguish her, even
                  besides her uncle's fortune. I wonder if she is as ugly as ever. <emph>I</emph>
                  should really like to see her."</p>
               <p>"So should I," replied Mrs. Dushane, with an involuntary sigh, for there were
                  moments when nature spoke in her heart, and she had become convinced, from her own
                  fatal experience, that there were other qualities necessary in a daughter besides
                  personal beauty. There were times "when the whole head was sick, and the whole
                  heart faint," when she would have welcomed a filial hand to bathe her temples, or
                  hold her aching brow, even though it were the hand of her neglected child. There
                  were times when the rebellious will, the selfish vanity, the careless disrespect,
                  or bold defiance of the spoiled favourite, made her feel as if Heaven's
                  retribution might be felt in this world. At others, when she saw her caressed and
                  admired, and heard herself envied as the mother of such a paragon, she tried to
                  convince herself that disobedience and ill-humour were only slight flaws in this
                  matchless diamond, which it would be invidious to dwell upon. She had had no
                  communication with her brother during his residence in Europe, and believing that
                  all intercourse with him would now probably cease, and that there was no hope of
                  his substituting Clara for Effie, she became more and more anxious to secure for
                  the former an establishment worthy of her charms. Clara was now before the world
                  as an acknowledged belle, occupying that place in society for which she had been
                  solely calculated, and which she had been made to believe a part of her
                  birthright.</p>
               <p>One evening, Mrs. Dushane accompanied her daughter to the house of a lady who,
                  being a great amateur in music, was very fond of giving concerts. Clara, as a
                  beauty, and a brilliant performer, was always invited. This evening, the lady told
                  Clara to look her prettiest, and do her prettiest, as a young lady was to be
                  present—a stranger, just arrived in town—who was said to have most remarkable and
                  fascinating accomplishments. Clara's vain and eager eye ran over the crowd, in
                  search of one who would have the hardihood to rival her. She had scarcely assured
                  herself that there were none but familiar faces around her, when the lady of the
                  house approached and begged permission to introduce her to Miss Horton, the young
                  lady whose coming she had announced. The company fell back as the hostess led
                  Clara and her mother through the folding doors, to the centre of another
                  apartment, where a young lady stood beneath the full blaze of the chandeliers,
                  leaning on the arm of a young and distinguished-looking stranger. Clara gazed
                  intently on the form of this rival beauty, and a feeling of relieved
                     self-complacency<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6687-00000016"/> dimpled the roses of
                  her cheeks. Those on whom nature has lavished her living lilies and carnations,
                  are very apt to depreciate the charms of those whose pretensions to loveliness are
                  based on other attributes than mere beauty of complexion. That of the young
                  stranger was what Clara called dark, and it might have appeared so, contrasted
                  with the dazzling whiteness of her own, but it had that oriental delicacy and
                  transparency so seldom found except in eastern climes. Her eyes were so dark and
                  resplendent that their brightness would have been almost overpowering had they not
                  been softened by long, sweeping lashes, of the same jetty hue as her luxuriant and
                  shining hair. Her figure was exquisite in repose, and from its waving outline
                  promised that grace of motion which is more pleasing than beauty itself. There was
                  nothing conspicuous in her dress save a small diamond star that sparkled amid the
                  darkness of her tresses, like a lone planet on "night's ebon brow." The gentleman
                  on whose arm she leaned—ah, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Not his the form, not his the eye,</l>
                        <l>That youthful maidens wont to fly."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Clara marked him as her victim, and met his exceedingly earnest gaze with a
                  glance of soft allurement. The young lady, whose air and appearance betrayed
                  familiarity with the most elegant and fashionable society, nevertheless manifested
                  no small degree of embarrassment while passing through the customary forms of
                  introduction. She coloured deeply, and her eyes were bent down with an expression
                  pression of modesty and humility entirely unexpected from her previous
                  bearing.</p>
               <p>"Horton!" repeated Mrs. Dushane, when her name was announced; "I have a brother of
                  that name now in Europe. It is a long time since I have seen him, however," she
                  added, with a sigh.</p>
               <p>"Then I hope you will have pleasing associations connected with me, madam," said
                  Miss Horton, in a sweet, low voice.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dushane, who was prepared to wage warfare with one who might rival her
                  daughter, could not help feeling the charm of such affability and sweetness. She
                  wondered who the Mr. Alston was, who accompanied her, but, notwithstanding his
                  juxtaposition with the attractive stranger, she could not but hope that he was the
                  rich and distinguished individual heaven had destined for her favourite child.</p>
               <p>Music was the order of the evening, and Clara was led to the piano, Miss Horton
                  declining to play first. Being from early childhood accustomed to sing and play in
                  public, she had no faltering of modesty, to mar the brilliancy of her execution.
                  She sang and played as she did every thing else, for effect—and it was generally
                  such as the most exacting vanity could desire. Mr. Alston and Miss Horton stood
                  near her, and evinced, by their silent attention, the most flattering interest in
                  the beautiful songster.</p>
               <p>"And now, Miss Horton," cried the impatient hostess—and "Miss Horton" passed from
                  mouth to mouth, as the circle pressed and narrowed around her—"Perhaps Miss Horton
                  would prefer the harp?"</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6687-00000017"/>
               <p>"She <emph>was</emph> more accustomed to the harp," she replied, and a splendid
                  instrument was drawn toward her.</p>
               <p>Clara was no proficient on the harp, having, in a fit of obstinacy, given up her
                  lessons, because the chords blistered her delicate fingers. She felt a thrill of
                  envy, as she beheld Miss Horton seat herself gracefully before the lyre, such as
                  the "shepherd monarch once swept," and pass her white hands over the strings. At
                  first her touch was soft, and her voice low, and she looked at Clara as if
                  deprecating her criticism; but, after a while, she looked at no one—she thought of
                  nothing but the spirit of music that filled her soul, thrilled through her nerves,
                  flowed in her veins, and burned upon her cheek. There was no affectation in her
                  manner—there was enthusiasm, sensibility, fire—but it was the fire from within,
                  illuminating the temple, which its intensity sometimes threatened to destroy. It
                  is true, she once or twice raised her glorious black eyes to heaven, but it was
                  because music naturally lifted her thoughts to heaven, and her glance followed its
                  inspiration.</p>
               <p>"Are you not weary?" asked Clara, after she had again and again yielded to the
                  entreaties of her auditors to give them another and yet another strain.</p>
               <p>"No," answered she, rising; "but I must not forget that others may be,
                  notwithstanding their apparent sympathy with an enthusiast like myself."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Delamere," cried Clara, addressing a pale, pensive, and intellectual
                  gentleman, who had stood, as if spell-bound, by the harp, "do not look so
                  reproachfully at me; I did not think of putting a stop to your ecstasy."</p>
               <p>"You are right," said he, drawing a deep inspiration; "I was forgetting the mortal
                  in the immortal."</p>
               <p>"Oh! that we all, and always could!" exclaimed Miss Horton; "but those who speak
                  of immortality in a scene like this, must be singularly bold."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it would be more in keeping by that window, which looks out upon the
                  magnificence of an evening sky," answered Mr. Delamere, with a smile so winning,
                  she could not but yield to the invitation; and, seated in a curtained embrasure,
                  which admitted the fresh night breeze, she soon found she was with a companion to
                  whom she was not ashamed to communicate her most glowing thoughts, for she
                  "received her own with usury." He had travelled over many lands—over the countries
                  from which she had just returned—and she felt as if she heard once more the song
                  of the Alpine peasant, the rich strains of the Italian improvisatore, or beheld
                  again the sublime and storied scenes so vividly impressed upon her memory. But, at
                  times, her abstracted eye told of other subjects of contemplation. She thought of
                  the mother whose unkindness had embittered her childhood, now smiling
                  unconsciously on her neglected offspring, and she longed to throw herself on her
                  neck, and ask her to forget the past, and welcome back her no longer ugly Effie.
                  She looked at her sister, on whose angelic face evil passions had left no more
                  trace than the rough bark on the<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6687-00000018"/> glassy
                  wave, and, forgetting the scorn and contumely she had heaped upon her in the
                  first, dark portion of her life, she yearned to embrace her, to press to her own
                  those smiling lips, and call her by the sweet name of sister.</p>
               <p>"Not yet," said she to herself; "I have promised my uncle to shine before them a
                  little while, at least till I have won their admiration as a stranger, and
                  triumphed as another, ere I allow them to recognize in me the hated and ugly
                  Effie."</p>
               <p>Surprised at her silence, Mr. Delamere watched her thoughtful and varying
                  countenance with an interest that surprised himself. His early history was
                  romantic. In the very dawn of manhood he had formed an attachment for a fragile
                  and lovely young creature, who expired suddenly on the very morning of her nuptial
                  day, and whose white bridal wreath was placed upon the shroud that mantled her
                  virgin bosom. Delamere, in the anguish of so awful a bereavement, secluded himself
                  long from the world, which, to him, seemed covered with a funereal pall, and
                  devoted himself to the memory of the dead. But, at length, the solicitations of
                  friendship, the energies of youth, and the strong necessity of social life, drew
                  him back to the scenes which he had once frequented, chastened by sorrow, enriched
                  by experience, the history of the past written on his pallid cheek, and speaking
                  from his pensive eye. No wonder that the music of Effie's voice had thrilled
                  through a heart whose strings had once been so rudely broken. He felt for the
                  young songstress a most painful interest, for he saw she was one born to feel and
                  to suffer; for when were deep feeling and suffering ever disunited?</p>
               <p>"Is not Clara beautiful, Dudley?" asked Effie, the morning after the sisters met.
                  "Is she not beautiful as the dreams of imagination?"</p>
               <p>"She is, indeed, most exquisitely fair," answered he; "she has almost conquered my
                  prejudices against blondes. But she is no more to be compared to you, Effie, than
                  a clear, cloudless day is to a starry, resplendent night. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'<emph>Thou</emph> walk'st in beauty, like the night</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Of cloudless climes and starry skies.'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Don't flatter me, Dudley," cried she impatiently; "I know its exact value, which
                  few girls, so young as myself, can say. Let there be nothing but truth and
                  sincerity between us. Now is the time to prove whether the love you bear me is the
                  result of habit and association, or that passion which would have selected me for
                  its object, though we had been heretofore sundered as far as from pole to pole.
                  Unfortunately, my uncle's wishes are known to both of us, revealed in an unguarded
                  moment. To me, I acknowledge, his slightest wish is a law, and you know my heart
                  has not murmured at his will."</p>
               <p>She blushed, and averted her eyes, which she was conscious expressed in still
                  stronger language the feelings she was uttering.</p>
               <p>"What is it you mean?" exclaimed he vehemently. "Do you doubt my truth and
                  constancy, when, from<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6687-00000019"/> the first moment I
                  beheld you, I have scarcely had a thought or wish which has not been entwined with
                  you? You were the star of my boyhood, you are the cynosure of my manhood, and age
                  will bring no change. No, it is for me to doubt—not you, Effie."</p>
               <p>While this conversation was passing between them, at the hotel where Mr. Horton
                  had put up, incog., for the purpose already explained, Mrs. Dushane and Clara were
                  expatiating on the young stranger who had flashed across their path the preceding
                  evening.</p>
               <p>"I do not think her really handsome, mother," said Clara; "she is not fair enough
                  for that. She reminded me of some one whom I have seen before, but I cannot think
                  who it is."</p>
               <p>"It is the same case with me," said her mother; "I have been trying to think who
                  she is like, but in vain. She certainly created a great sensation, and she was
                  very affable and polite to me. How I wish you had not given up the harp, Clara!
                  It's a thousand times more graceful an instrument than the piano. It was nothing
                  but your waywardness. I told you you would repent of it some day."</p>
               <p>"If I did play on the harp," said Clara, pettishly, "I wouldn't put myself into
                  such ecstasies at my own music, as she did. I don't believe Mr. Alston admires her
                  singing much, for he talked to me almost the whole time."</p>
               <p>"Yes, because you talked to him. But, seriously, Clara, he is a fine-looking young
                  man, and may be very rich. You had better try to captivate him, even if he is
                  already captivated by Miss Horton. How familiar that name does sound! We must
                  invite them to our house—make a party for them—for they evidently are persons of
                  distinction."</p>
               <p>"Not a musical party, mother. One good thing, however, we have no harp here."</p>
               <p>The party was given, and Effie crossed once more, with unconquerable emotions, the
                  threshold of her childhood's home. She entered the drawing-room, followed by a
                  train of obsequious admirers, and received by the mistress of the mansion with all
                  the pomp and ceremony of fashionable politeness. She was magnificently dressed,
                  for it was her uncle's pleasure that she should be so, and Clara felt, with envy
                  and bitterness, that she was eclipsed by this splendid stranger.</p>
               <p>"I will win Alston, if I die," ejaculated she to herself: "for I know she loves
                  him, and it will be such a triumph!"</p>
               <p>Monopolized as Effie was, with Delamere flitting a pensive shadow at her side, it
                  was difficult for Dudley Alston to claim any portion of her attention. It was
                  therefore an easy task for Clara to monopolize <emph>him.</emph> She laid aside
                  her frivolity, veiled her vanity, and taxed her mind to the fullest extent of its
                  powers, to interest and amuse him. She had a great deal of tact, and could talk
                  with a fluent tongue, while the loveliest smiles gave a charm to the words she
                  uttered. Dudley could not help being pleased with this flattering attention. He
                  knew from Mr. Horton that she was a spoiled and unamiable child, and was prepared
                  to dislike and avoid her, but he could not believe<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000020"/> aught but gentleness now dwelt in a breast so fair.
                  Effie had entreated him to endeavour to think favourably of Clara, forgetting her
                  childish foibles, and for her sake he ought to do it. Mrs. Dushane was more and
                  more delighted with Miss Horton, for nothing could be more deferential than her
                  manners towards her. She sought her conversation, and turned from all her
                  admirers, whenever she had an opportunity of addressing her. Mrs. Dushane could
                  hardly withdraw her eyes from her face. That haunting resemblance! It vexed and
                  pained her. Once, moved by a sudden reminiscence, she whispered to Clara—</p>
               <p>"It is the most ridiculous thing I ever knew—and yet there is something about Miss
                  Horton that really makes me think of our Effie."</p>
               <p>"Shocking!" exclaimed Clara, laughing outright. "What would Miss Horton say, if
                  she knew you compared her to such a thing as Effie?"</p>
               <p>Alston caught the name of Effie.</p>
               <p>"You were speaking of some one by the name of Effie," said he. "I have always
                  admired it since I read the Heart of Midlothian. Is the Effie to whom you allude,
                  as beautiful as the lily of St. Leonard's?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no—it is my own sister, whom my uncle adopted, and who is now in Europe with
                  him. She is very far from being pretty."</p>
               <p>"Indeed," said he, "is that possible, and your sister, too? Does she not resemble
                  you in the least?"</p>
               <p>"No," answered she, with a shiver of disgust. "She is lean, swarthy, and almost
                  deformed. But uncle will give her a large fortune, and that will make up for her
                  defects."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she has improved since you saw her last," said Dudley, and he could not
                  help casting an admiring glance towards Effie, whose graceful head was at that
                  moment turned towards her mother—in the act of listening. Effie had been praising
                  the beauty of Clara, and asked if she were an only daughter.</p>
               <p>"No—I have one beside," answered Mrs. Dushane, in a confused manner; "but she
                  lives with her uncle, who has adopted her."</p>
               <p>"Is it long since you have seen her, madame?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes—she was a little child when he took her, and now she is a young
                  lady."</p>
               <p>"If she was as beautiful as her sister, I should think you would long to see her,"
                  said Effie.</p>
               <p>"She wasn't to be compared to Clara: indeed, she was as ugly as her sister is
                  pretty!"</p>
               <p>"Poor girl!" cried Effie; "I hope you did not love her less because Nature denied
                  the gift of beauty?"</p>
               <p>"Why, no," stammered Mrs. Dushane: "one can't help their looks. But here were
                  uncommon."</p>
               <p>"Do you think you would know her now after so long an absence?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—I should know her any where. She looked like nobody in the world but
                  herself."</p>
               <p>A half-suppressed sigh, which followed these words, sounded in Effie's ear like
                  the music of the spheres. She unconsciously echoed it, and it was echoed yet
                  again, for the pensive Delamere was lingering by her side,<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000021"/> and this token of sensibility interested him more
                  than all the brilliancy of her attractions.</p>
               <p>"Can she have known sorrow?" thought he. The next self-interrogation was—"Has she
                  known love? And oh! how ardently, how devotedly," thus continued his meditations,
                  "such a being must love! Would she accept the reins of a heart once impassioned as
                  her own? Would she mingle the unfaded blossoms of her youth with the dark cypress
                  and melancholy yew?"</p>
               <p>Effie, touched by the soft gloom that hung like a cloud around him, lent a more
                  than willing ear to his conversation. But, while she listened to him, her thoughts
                  often wandered to one whom Clara kept ever near her, and on whom her eyes turned
                  with an expression of unequivocal admiration. A pang shot through her heart, such
                  as but one passion can inflict. Then another succeeded, that she was capable of
                  yielding to such an emotion.</p>
               <p>"If he be not mine, wholly mine, heart, soul and life, I will resign him, though I
                  die in the effort," was the language of the maiden's soul. Her love had hitherto
                  flowed on, a clear, unruffled stream, rising in the green hills of adolescence,
                  its channels margined with flowers, and its current gilded by the sunbeams. Now
                  the waters were becoming troubled, for they were rolling over a rocky bed. Did the
                  rocks betoken that a whirlpool was near, and was the frail bark of her happiness
                  to be wrecked in its vortex?</p>
               <p>One morning, when the demon of ill-temper, roused by some petty disappointment,
                  had full possession of Clara, and proud Mrs. Dushane, as usual, was the victim of
                  its inflictions, a letter came from Mr. Horton, announcing his return from Europe,
                  and his intention of visiting her immediately, with his adopted daughter. This
                  annunciation could not have been made at a moment more propitious for Effie; for
                  her spirit was chafed and smarting from the ungrateful conduct of Clara. She sat,
                  however, like one in a trance, for she was ashamed and perplexed in what manner to
                  receive her long-estranged daughter. An acknowledged heiress, fresh from the
                  courts of Europe, was a being of some consequence, no matter how ugly she might
                  be.</p>
               <p>"Poor Effie!" exclaimed she; "I did treat her shamefully, and all for the most
                  selfish and passionate of human beings, with nothing on earth to recommend her but
                  a little beauty, of which I am getting heartily sick."</p>
               <p>"Oh! <emph>Madame Mamma,</emph>" cried Clara, who still retained some of the
                  deeply respectful language of her childhood; "it is too late to sing that song;
                  you are ten times more vain of me than I am of myself. If I am vain, you taught me
                  to be so; if I am passionate, you set me the example. 'It won't do for folks that
                  live in glass houses to throw stones.' But, good heavens, what shall we do with
                  Effie, at all these fine parties they are making for Miss Horton? Oh! I forget she
                  can talk Greek and Latin, and French, and Italian. She is a learned lady, and will
                  put me quite in the shade. An heiress, too! Perhaps Dudley Alston will fall in
                  love with her. What in the world<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6687-00000022"/> shall I
                  say to her? I declare I never felt so strange about any thing in my life."</p>
               <p>"You had better treat her kindly, if it is only from policy, Miss Clara, for,
                  though you deserve it not, she may share her fortune with you—for I remember well
                  the poor thing was generous to a fault!"</p>
               <p>Clara, upon reflection, concluded to act upon this hint, and she began to think
                  too that it would be a delightful thing to have Effie near, as a foil to her own
                  beauty. She would shine still brighter in the dark, beaming eyes of Dudley
                  Alston.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dushane felt in a state of trepidation the remainder of the day. The sound of
                  carriage wheels made her start, and change colour. The sudden opening of the door
                  made her heart beat almost to suffocation.</p>
               <p>"Oh! how I wish it were over!" she would say. "If I only knew how she felt towards
                  me, I should be easy. If I only knew how she looked! She can't help being ugly,
                  though."</p>
               <p>About the twilight hour, the carriage of Mr. Horton did indeed roll up to the
                  door, and Mrs. Dushane beheld her brother descend with a veiled lady clinging to
                  his arm. A large shawl wrapped her figure, though the weather did not seem to
                  require such a protection. Even when she entered, they could see nothing of her
                  face through the thick green veil that covered it.</p>
               <p>"Ugly still!" thought Clara, "or she would not take such pains to hide
                  herself."</p>
               <p>"I have brought you back a daughter," said Mr. Horton, after embracing his sister
                  and Clara; "but remember, my sister, if you place the least value on a brother's
                  love, not to wound her feelings again, with regard to her personal deficiencies.
                  She comes to you a good, affectionate and intelligent girl, who cherishes no
                  vindictive feelings for the past, and who is anxious to show you all the
                  tenderness of a child."</p>
               <p>"Only promise to love me, my mother, half as well as you do Clara," said Effie, in
                  a trembling voice, throwing her arms around her mother's neck and leaning her head
                  on her shoulder, "and I will not ask for more."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dushane, completely overcome by this unexpected softness and humility,
                  pressed the veiled figure of her child to her heart, and wept and sobbed till her
                  brother led her to a seat, and calmed her agitation.</p>
               <p>"And you too, my sister," cried the same sweet, tremulous voice; "let us
                  henceforth love one another."</p>
               <p>Clara returned the embrace, with a semblance of warmth, but she was dying with
                  curiosity to look under the green veil and the muffling shawl. She saw with
                  surprise, however, that the hand which clasped hers, was of exquisite delicacy and
                  symmetry, soft and jewelled as her own.</p>
               <p>"Let me take off your bonnet and shawl," said she; "you must be very warm."</p>
               <p>The servant at this moment entered with lights, thus dispersing the shades of
                  twilight which lingered in the room. Effie first gave the shawl into Clara's<pb
                     n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6687-00000023"/> eager hand, revealing by the act the full
                  outlines of her splendid figure; then throwing off the bonnet and veil, and
                  shaking back her jetty ringlets, she turned and knelt at her mother's feet.</p>
               <p>"Behold your Effie!" exclaimed she—"no longer sullen and unloving, and I trust no
                  longer ugly. My dear uncle was determined you should admire me, before you knew my
                  identity, so you must forgive me for having appeared in masquerade. Having assumed
                  his honoured name, it was an easier task. I think you liked me as a
                  stranger;—refuse not to love me now."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dushane was so bewildered and astonished and delighted, she was very near
                  falling into hysteric fits. When she was composed enough to speak, she repeated in
                  a kind of triumph:</p>
               <p>"I said she looked like our Effie—I said she made me think of our Effie."</p>
               <p>Clara's blooming cheek turned to the whiteness of marble. The chill of envy
                  penetrated to her very heart. The fascinating being whom she dreaded as a rival,
                  was then her own sister; so long the object of her contempt and derision. The
                  transformation was too great. It was incredible! Effie met her cold, fixed gaze,
                  and an involuntary shiver ran through her veins. The image of Dudley Alston passed
                  before her, and she feared to think of the future.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dushane was so proud of her new daughter, so pleased and excited by the eclat
                  and romance of the circumstances that attended her arrival, and her house was so
                  thronged with visitors, she had hardly any time to think of Clara. But Clara was
                  not forgetful of herself. To win Dudley Alston, whom she loved as far as her vain
                  heart was capable of loving, was the end and aim of all her hopes and resolves. To
                  win him from Effie was a double triumph, for which she was willing to sacrifice
                  truth, honour, and that maiden modesty which shrinks from showing an unsolicited
                  attachment. She believed that if she could convince Effie that she herself was
                  beloved by Alston, she would be too proud ever to look upon him as a lover, and
                  that, if Alston supposed Delamere a successful and favoured admirer of Effie's,
                  the same pride would make him stand aloof and forbid him to seek an explanation.
                  Effie was too ingenuous and high-souled to suspect Clara of acting this doubly
                  treacherous part. She felt as only a nature like hers can feel, that Dudley Alston
                  was more and more estranged from her, but she believed Clara was supplanting her
                  in his affections, and disdained either by look or word to draw him back to his
                  allegiance.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of Dudley Alston, Effie?" asked Clara, abruptly, once when they
                  chanced to be alone.</p>
               <p>Effie's quick blood rushed burningly to her cheeks.</p>
               <p>"As the associate of my youthful pleasures, as my fellow-student and
                  fellow-traveller, he must naturally seem very near to me," she answered, with
                  assumed composure.</p>
               <p>"He is very handsome, very pleasing," said Clara, with affected confusion, "and I
                  cannot help liking<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6687-00000024"/> him better than any
                  one I ever knew; you who have known him so long, can tell me whether I may trust
                  him—I will say it, Effie—whether I may dare to love him!"</p>
               <p>Effie turned deadly pale—she looked in her sister's face, and asked the simple
                  question—</p>
               <p>"Has he told you that he loved you, Clara?"</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! what a question!" exclaimed Clara, with a look of offended modesty;
                  "do you think I would have made such a confession, had I not been in the first
                  place aware of his love?"</p>
               <p>"No, surely you would not," answered she, in a voice so strange and unnatural that
                  Clara trembled at the bold step she had taken. She began to fear the
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, Effie?" said she. "Are you faint?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," she replied, passing her hand hurriedly over her brow; "but the
                  air is very close here. I will go into the balcony."</p>
               <p>She rose as she spoke, and Clara rose simultaneously.</p>
               <p>"I would rather be alone," said Effie; and Clara dared not follow.</p>
               <p>"The hour of trial is come," thought Effie; "let me meet it without
                  blenching!"</p>
               <p>She wandered into the garden, and sat down under the shade of the sycamore, where
                  her uncle had found her years before, longing, in the bitterness of her young
                  heart, to die. How long she sat, she knew not—she was roused by the approach of
                  Dudley Alston, who, seeing her sitting like a pale statue there, forgot, for the
                  moment, the withering doubts which Clara had been breathing into his ear.</p>
               <p>"Effie, why are you here, sitting so pale and still?" cried he in a tone of the
                  deepest tenderness.</p>
               <p>Effie rose and leaned against the tree for support.</p>
               <p>"Lean on me, dearest Effie," continued he, passing his arm round her waist, and
                  drawing her towards him; "you are ill—you are faint."</p>
               <p>Indignation gave her strength, as she released herself from his clasping arms.</p>
               <p>"I can forgive inconstancy, Dudley, but not insult," said she, and the lightning
                  darted from her eyes;—"you remember that I told you, if the hour should come when
                  your heart was not wholly mine, I would not wed my fate to yours, though life
                  should be the sacrifice. Had you nobly and ingenuously told me that you no longer
                  loved me, that my more beautiful sister had won the affection you once thought
                  mine, I would have forgiven, I would still have loved you as a brother. But to
                  mock me still with looks and words of seeming love—I cannot, will not bear
                  it."</p>
               <p>"By the heaven above," exclaimed the young man vehemently, "I swear this charge is
                  false! Who dares to accuse me? If it be Delamere, his lily face shall soon wear
                  another livery."</p>
               <p>"No, Dudley—wrong not one who is incapable of any thing mean and calumniating.
                  Clara herself has disclosed to me your love and hers, and I here declare you as
                  free from all allegiance to me, as the cloud that is passing over the sun. But she
                  may as well build<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6687-00000025"/> her home on that thin,
                  grey cloud, as trust for happiness to a heart as light and vain as yours."</p>
               <p>"Effie!" cried he, forcibly seizing her hand, and holding her back as she turned
                  to depart; "you shall not go from me thus. Come with me into your sister's
                  presence, and let her explain this shameful mystery. I have never breathed one
                  syllable to her but the commonplace language of admiration. My heart has never
                  wandered from you toward her, or one of womankind. Come with me. I demand it as an
                  act of justice—I claim it as a sacred right!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," exclaimed a deeper voice from behind, "he has a right, and I will sustain
                  it."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Horton emerged from an arbour, which the foliage of the spreading sycamore
                  partially formed. He had been reading in the shade—one of his daily habits in
                  summer—and had overheard a conversation fraught with intense interest to him.
                  Strange!—the good man despised the character of a listener, and yet it was the
                  second time he had involuntarily acted the part of one, in the really dramatic
                  history of his sister's family. He was indignant and excited, and drawing Effie's
                  trembling arm through his, he led her towards the house, with no lagging
                  footsteps. As they came through a back path, they entered the room before Clara
                  had time to escape. When she met her uncle's stern eye and frowning brow, she knew
                  she was to be arraigned as a criminal, in the presence of the man for whom she had
                  bartered her integrity, and bartered it in vain.</p>
               <p>"I have lost him forever," whispered her sinking heart, "but I will never recant
                  what I have said—he never shall be hers!"</p>
               <p>"Clara," said her uncle, approaching still nearer, and keeping his piercing eyes
                  upon her, "tell me the truth, on your soul's peril—has this young man ever made
                  professions of love to you?"</p>
               <p>Clara bowed her head slowly, till her ringlets half veiled her beautiful face.</p>
               <p>"I have revealed it to my sister, and I cannot deny it to you."</p>
               <p>"This is too much!" exclaimed Dudley, his face turning hueless as ashes. "Oh, if
                  she were but a man!"</p>
               <p>"Peace, Dudley!" cried Mr. Horton, in a commanding voice. Then again turning to
                  Clara.</p>
               <p>"I remember, years ago, a little girl, who wantonly broke the geranium her mother
                  prized, and, to screen herself from blame, boldly accused her innocent sister of
                  the fault she had herself committed. Have you forgotten it?—or the shame and
                  sorrow of that hour? Clara, you are still the same—false, false to the very
                  heart's core."</p>
               <p>"You always hated me," cried Clara, trying to assume a bolder tone, in the
                  desperation of her situation; "you always hated me, and took Effie's part against
                  me. I wouldn't have told her what I did, though I have said nothing but the truth,
                  if I had thought she would have cared any thing about it. I'm sure she might be
                  satisfied with her new lover, Mr. Delamere, without making such a fuss about a<pb
                     n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6687-00000026"/> castaway, to whom I condescend to show
                  some favour."</p>
               <p>"Clara," exclaimed Effie, raising her brow from her uncle's shoulder, where she
                  had bent it in anguish and shame during this disgraceful scene—"Clara, you have
                  betrayed yourself, by this double falsehood. You know that I have refused Mr.
                  Delamere as a lover, but that I honour him as a friend. I considered such a secret
                  sacred, but you have forced me to reveal it. Dudley, my heart acquits you fully,
                  freely, humbly—for oh! how much have I erred in thus doubting thy honour and thy
                  truth!"</p>
               <p>Their eyes met, as they turned towards each other. How they would have sealed
                  their reconciliation cannot be known, for Mr. Horton threw his arms around them
                  both so closely, in the fulness of his joy, that their hearts beat against each
                  other, while they found a parental pillow on his own. Tears fell from the good
                  man's eyes.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, my children," cried he, kissing Effie's crimsoned cheek, "and make
                  you a blessing to each other. Let not the falsehood and guile of others ever again
                  shake your confidence and love. Let your love be founded on a rock—even the Rock
                  of Ages; then the winds and waves may beat against it in vain."</p>
               <p>During this scene, the guilty, foiled, and consequently wretched Clara, stole
                  unnoticed from the apartment, and in the solitude of her own chamber gave vent to
                  the violence of long-suppressed passion.</p>
               <p>"Oh! that I had been born ugly!" she said, stamping in the impotence of her rage:
                  then running to a mirror, and gazing on her convulsed features—"I am ugly now—good
                  heavens, how horrible are the effects of passion! Yes, mother," continued she—for
                  Mrs. Dushane, who had heard the loud and angry voices below, without daring to
                  enter, fearing in some way that Clara was involved in the difficulty, softly
                  opened the door of the chamber and looked anxiously in—"yes, mother, come and see
                  your <emph>beauty</emph> now! See your own work, and be proud! If you hadn't
                  called me your beauty, your pet, your darling, till I sickened at your flattery,
                  and loathed the author of it—if you had cultivated in me one moral virtue, I
                  should never have been the detected, hated and despised thing I am now!"</p>
               <p>Poor Mrs. Dushane! She had sown the wind, and reaped the whirlwind.</p>
               <p>Effie, who pitied her unhappy sister, would gladly have shared her fortune with
                  her, but this her uncle forbade.</p>
               <p>"If she should be in want and sorrow, you shall relieve and comfort her," said he,
                  in answer to her prayers. "If she marries, for your mother's sake, you may supply
                  her wedding paraphernalia; but I will never make her the guardian of Heaven's
                  bounty—never give her the means of administering to her own evil passions."</p>
               <p>The UGLY EFFIE, soon a happy bride, became her mother's pet and darling. The
                  BEAUTIFUL CLARA, still unmarried, continued to embitter her peace, and present a
                  fatal example of the evils of maternal favouritism.</p>

               <p>THE evening was cold and clear. The stars sparkled dazzlingly above, the frost

                  around him and walked on with a rapid step.</p>
               <p>The stranger who passed him in the dim starlight might have taken him for some
                  Haroun Al Raschid in disguise, he wore his cloak with such lordly grace, and his
                  head sat so nobly and proudly on his shoulders. But, alas! Mordaunt was very poor.
                  He had but one dollar in his pocket, and he knew not what the morrow would bring
                  forth. He was a young physician, just commencing practice in a large city, with no
                  capital except his brains, but with a stock of enthusiasm, hope, and faith
                  (notwithstanding a dark and mysterious destiny had shadowed his youth), sufficient
                  to endow all the Medical Institutions in the world. He was now treading the margin
                  of his profession, watching the great rushing sea of life that roared around him,
                  ready to seize hold of some sinking mariner, and save him from destruction. But
                  the poor wretches were sure to stretch out their trembling arms to some older,
                  more experienced swimmer on the human tide, and the young man was obliged to work
                  off his superfluous energy and skill in acts of gratuitous service. This evening
                  he had been unusually fortunate. He had received one dollar as a fee, and having a
                  passionate love of the drama, he was about to indulge himself in a visit to the
                  theatre, whose doors poverty had long closed against him. A distinguished actor
                  was <emph>starring</emph> on the boards, and Mordaunt was hastening to secure a
                  favourable seat in the parquette. At the corner of the street, he met a young man
                  of the name of Wiley, who, turning round, walked in the same direction with him.
                  Mordaunt always felt as if he came in contact with a counter stream of thought,
                  when he met this young man; and now it seemed as if a dash of cold, quenching
                  water was thrown over the glow of his anticipations. There was no sympathy, no
                  congeniality. It was the contrast of fire and ice.</p>
               <p>"Whither so fast, Mordaunt?"</p>
               <p>"To the theatre. Are you disposed for the same amusement?"</p>
               <p>"No; I cannot afford it!"</p>
               <p>"Afford!" repeated Mordaunt, in an accent of surprise.</p>
               <p>Wiley was reputed wealthy, and thousands taken from his pockets would scarcely
                  leave as deep a void as Mordaunt's solitary dollar.</p>
               <p>"I cannot afford the time," repeated Wiley. "Life is too short for the great
                  purposes of utility, and too precious to be wasted in search of amusement. I find
                  no leisure for such things myself; but every one has a right to put his own
                  estimate on the gifts of God, and improve them as he thinks best."</p>
               <p>There was something cold and cutting in the tone of his voice, something
                  assimilated to the frosty atmosphere, that penetrated the ear of Mordaunt and
                  chilled him.</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6687-00000028"/>
               <p>"I know there are some," he replied, "who can keep on, day after day, and year
                  after year, in the same tread-mill mode of existence, unconscious of weariness as
                  of progress; but I cannot; I must have occasional excitement. I cannot sit forever
                  in my office, waiting for the stagnant waters of the pool to be stirred by the
                  angel of success. The principle of vitality burns too intensely in my bosom for
                  inaction. It must have fuel. If not of the kind I most desire, the light
                  combustibles which a random breeze may throw in its way——"</p>
               <p>"For God's sake," exclaimed a broken voice, so suddenly it made them both start,
                  "for God's sake, gentlemen, show me the way to a doctor. My wife is dying. Where
                  can I find a doctor?"</p>
               <p>The blaze of a gas-lamp fell full upon the face of the speaker. It was a man
                  miserably poor, to judge by his patched and threadbare garments. He had no outer
                  covering to protect him from the cold night air, and his old, napless hat, that
                  beacon-sign of decaying gentility, looked as if it had been Fortune's foot-ball.
                  In the weak, trembling under lip, the wan, bloodshot eye, the ravages of
                  intemperance were written in defacing characters. At this moment, however, he was
                  in the sober possession of all his faculties. Despair and remorse lent urgency and
                  eloquence to his accents.</p>
               <p>"For the love of Heaven," he again repeated, "direct me to a doctor. Though," he
                  added with bitterness, "I have not a cent in the world to pay him——"</p>
               <p>"I am a physician," cried Mordaunt, his warm, impulsive heart glowing within him
                  at the prospect of being able to administer relief to suffering humanity. "Show me
                  where you live. I will see what I can do for your wife."</p>
               <p>"The Lord Almighty bless you!" exclaimed the suppliant, the tears which are ever
                  ready to flow from the eyes of the inebriate washing his bloated cheeks.</p>
               <p>"I wish you joy of your patient," said Wiley. "This must be the angel who is to
                  stir the waters of the stagnant pool of life."</p>
               <p>Just as Mordaunt was turning to follow the steps of his miserable conductor,
                  without answering the sneering remark of Wiley, another man came rushing along the
                  pavement as if the avenger of blood was behind him.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" cried Wiley, moving instinctively from the path. "Are the
                  blood hounds let loose to-night?"</p>
               <p>"The horses have run away with my master," answered the man, panting for breath.
                  "He has been thrown upon the pavement. His leg is broken—his arm is fractured. I
                  want a doctor, a surgeon, at the quickest possible notice. For the love of mercy,
                  direct me to the nearest."</p>
               <p>"Well, Doctor Mordaunt," said Wiley, "your star seems to be in the ascendant
                  to-night. I know this man's master. It is Mr. Goldman, the modern Crœsus. Your
                  fortune is made."</p>
               <p>"I have promised this poor creature to go with<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000029"/> him," answered Mordaunt, struggling with the strong
                  temptation that beset him. The glow of compassion faded. Turning suddenly to the
                  wretched being who had been calling down blessings on his head, he said—</p>
               <p>"Tell me where you live, and as soon as I have attended to the gentleman who
                  requires my assistance, I will call and see your wife."</p>
               <p>"O, sir, she is dying—I left her in spasms. She will die if you delay. You
                  promised me, you know you did. God gave her life as well as the rich man. If you
                  let her perish, God will judge you for it, and man, too."</p>
               <p>The pale eye of the drunkard kindled fiercely as he spoke. He forgot that he had
                  been draining, drop by drop, the heart's blood of her whose life he was requiring
                  so vehemently of another.</p>
               <p>"He is right," said Mordaunt, heaving off the temptation, with a long, deep
                  inspiration; then directing the servant of Mr. Goldman to the office of Dr. Lewis,
                  an eminent surgeon as well as physician, he immediately followed the rapid but
                  unsteady steps of his guide.</p>
               <p>"Yes," repeated he to himself, as he walked along, glad that he had girded himself
                  for his task of mercy, "yes, he is right. Though waves of gold should roll over my
                  path, they could not drown the faintest whisper of accusing conscience. Yet, what
                  a glorious opportunity I have lost! Rich! Wiley says he is rich, and riches always
                  give influence. Let me imagine the result of the incident, supposing I could have
                  profited by this golden chance. He is rich—I am skilful—at least,
                     <emph>occultly</emph> so. He is suffering—I relieve him. He is munificent—I am
                  grateful. He becomes eloquent in praise of the young physician, recommends him to
                  favour, and favour comes fast treading on the heels of success. Dr.Mordaunt begins
                  to make a name and fame. The poor little bark, that has kept close to the shore,
                  without one favouring gale to fill its sail, now spreads them gallantly to the
                  breeze, and floats fearlessly on the foaming billows of the main. Ah! perchance
                  the rich man has a daughter—a lovely daughter—fair as the dream of a poet—a
                  Cordelia in filial tenderness, an Imogen in purity, and a Juliet in love. She
                  bends in transport over her recovering father, she blesses my healing power. She
                  raises her eyes of dewy splendour to my face. The accents of gratitude, which she
                  strives in vain to utter, melt on her sweet, rosy lips. I take her soft hand in
                  mine, when——"</p>
               <p>Mordaunt was suddenly checked in his sentimental reverie by coming in contact with
                  a cold, damp wall, whose resistance almost threw him backward. His guide had
                  turned into a narrow, dark alley, running back of a splendid block of buildings,
                  and the damp, close air breathed of the mould and vapours of the tomb. But the
                  pure stars glistened through the opening above with a concentration of brilliancy
                  absolutely sunlike. Mordaunt realized their immense, immeasurable distance. He
                  sighed as he looked up, thinking that even thus all that was bright and beautiful
                  seemed to elude him, shining cold and high, alluring and baffling. One star of
                  exceeding glory<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6687-00000030"/> riveted his gaze. Up in
                  the centre of the zenith it shone, a blazing diamond on the forehead of night. By
                  a sudden transition of thought, Mordaunt recalled the scene when the Chaldean
                  shepherds beheld the star of the East beaming above the manger which was made the
                  cradle of the infant God. What a glory thrown around poverty! A God in a manger!
                  Should one be ashamed of lowliness, when the Deity had wrapped himself in it, as a
                  mantle? Mordaunt felt a sublime contempt for all the gauds of this world. And this
                  sudden lifting of the soul was caused by that one bright, ascendant star, on which
                  his wandering gaze had fixed. That star was his—the whole heavens, with their
                  resplendent host, were his. A soul, capable of taking in this amplitude of glory,
                  was his—a heart, large enough to embrace all the suffering children of humanity,
                  was his. How could he call himself poor? All the dark past was forgotten.</p>
               <p>He was obliged to bend his head while passing into the low dwelling occupied by
                  the patient. The light was so dim, contrasted with the white dazzle of the stars
                  on which his eyes had been so long fixed, he did not at once see with distinctness
                  the interior of the apartment into which he was ushered. But gradually every
                  object came out as through the gloom of a morning twilight. A low bed, whose
                  snow-white covering spoke of neatness and lingering refinement in the midst of
                  penury and domestic misery, stood opposite the door, and above that snowy covering
                  rose a pale and ghastly face, with closed eyelids and parted lips, through which
                  the breath came slowly and gaspingly. By the side of the bed sat a figure wrapped
                  in a large, gray shawl, which nearly enveloped the whole person. The face
                  belonging to this figure turned slowly toward him, as he approached the bed, and
                  it shone upon him in that dim apartment like one of those evening stars he had
                  just been contemplating, beaming through a dull, gray cloud. It was a face of
                  youth and beauty, but pale, sad, and holy as a nun's; a countenance which had been
                  bending over the couch of the dying till the shadow of mortality had passed over
                  its brightness. No conscious start disturbed the quietude of her attitude, no
                  sudden blush coloured the fair cheek, as she met the wondering glance of Mordaunt,
                  who bowed his head in acknowledgment of her presence. A groan from the apparently
                  dying woman recalled his attention to her, and taking her thin and sallow hand in
                  his, he counted the low and flickering pulse; then lifting the candle from a
                  little table not far from the bed, he held it so that the light might fall upon
                  her faded and sunken features. Her eyelids moved not, as the rays flashed over
                  them. He spoke to her in a clear, deep voice, but the sound did not penetrate her
                  deafened ear.</p>
               <p>"She is not dying, doctor?" cried the man, fixing his bleared and rueful eyes on
                  Mordaunt's serious and earnest countenance. "You don't think she is dying,
                  doctor?"</p>
               <p>"She is very low, very low, indeed," replied Mordaunt. "How long has she been in
                  this exhausted state?"</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6687-00000031"/>
               <p>"About half an hour; ever since the spasm subsided," said the young lady with the
                  gray shawl.</p>
               <p>The voice was so sweet, and had such a subdued and holy tone, that Mordaunt held
                  his breath to listen.</p>
               <p>"O! it was terrible," she continued, "to witness that awful paroxysm!"</p>
               <p>"Surely you were not alone with her?" exclaimed the young doctor,
                  involuntarily.</p>
               <p>"No," she replied, with a slight shudder; "a servant was with me, whom a short
                  time since I sent for wine, thinking it might possibly revive her."</p>
               <p>"I fear it may be too late," said Mordaunt. "Her nervous system seems completely
                  destroyed, worn out by long struggles, I should think."</p>
               <p>Here he riveted his gaze on the drunken husband, with a look that spoke
                  volumes.</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> haven't killed her," he cried, weeping and sobbing aloud. "I know
                  I have not always treated her as I ought—I have sometimes been rough to her, when
                  I didn't well know what I was doing. I never struck her but once—as I
                  remember—never—I didn't mean to hurt her—I haven't killed her, doctor——"</p>
               <p>"But once!" exclaimed Mordaunt, indignantly. "It was enough! It was a
                  death-blow!"</p>
               <p>"Lord Almighty!" cried the man, staggering back into a chair, and turning
                  frightfully pale, as another deep groan echoed through the room.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt took up the vials clustered on the table, and after having examined them,
                  poured some ether in a glass, and having diluted it with water, put it to the
                  passive lips of the patient. The odour of the ethereal fluid seemed to revive her.
                  She breathed more easily, and the eyeballs began to move under the closed
                  lids.</p>
               <p>"She needs stimulants," said Mordaunt; "wine will not be strong enough. She must
                  have brandy, Here," added he to the husband, taking from his purse the solitary
                  dollar—that dollar which was to have been the open-sesame to the magic caverns of
                  fancy—and placing it in his hand, "here, go to the nearest apothecary's and get a
                  bottle of the best French brandy, such as they keep for the sick. Make haste."</p>
               <p>The bloodshot eyes of the drunkard flashed up with a sudden and fierce delight.
                  The very sound of the word <hi rend="i"/>brandy tingled his blunted senses. The
                  sight of the money was fuel to his feverish and brutal desires. Mordaunt felt a
                  gentle touch on his arm, and looking round, he saw the gleam of a white hand on
                  his dark coat. The folds of the gray shawl swept momentarily against him.</p>
               <p>"He is gone," said the young lady, in a tone of disappointment; "alas! he cannot
                  be trusted."</p>
               <p>"Surely, at a moment like this he <emph>must</emph> be faithful!" cried Mordaunt;
                  yet the recollection of the insane gleam of his eye made him shudder.</p>
               <p>"Strange that Hannah does not return," said the young lady, looking anxiously
                  toward the door. Her countenance brightened even as she spoke, for a woman came to
                  the threshold and beckoned her to<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6687-00000032"/>
                  approach. Mordaunt heard a startling exclamation from the gray-shawled damsel, in
                  answer to something the woman said, in a quick, low voice.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! My uncle! How could it happen? His arm and leg—both broken! O! what
                  a dreadful night!"</p>
               <p>She leaned against the frame of the door, as if overcome with the shock she had
                  received. Mordaunt saw that she was deadly pale, and handed her a glass of water.
                  She took it with a trembling hand, and as she raised her eyes to his face, he
                  remembered his reverie about the rich man's daughter, and how her vision had
                  passed before him, fixing her eyes of dewy splendour on his face. The vision
                  seemed realized—only it was the rich man's niece, instead of his daughter, and he
                  was in the poor man's hovel, instead of the rich man's palace.</p>
               <p>"You will not leave this poor creature," said she, folding her shawl closely
                  around her, and making a motion to Hannah to follow her. "My poor uncle! how much
                  he must suffer!"</p>
               <p>She stepped upon the threshold, unbonneted and unveiled.</p>
               <p>"Surely you are not going abroad without a protector, at this hour?" cried
                  Mordaunt, feeling the impossibility of leaving his poor patient alone, yet longing
                  to offer his services as an escort.</p>
               <p>"I have only to pass through the gate," she replied; "this cabin is back of my
                  uncle's yard. God bless you, sir, for your kindness to this poor woman! She is
                  worthy of it."</p>
               <p>She was gone—the <hi rend="i"/>Evening Star, as his spirit called her—and he
                  seemed left in darkness.</p>
               <p>Yes! this must be the niece of Mr. Goldman, whom he might have had for a patient,
                  and who might have opened to him the golden portals of success. Such an
                  opportunity scarcely occurs more than once in a lifetime. And what good had he
                  done to this poor woman? Ether and brandy might possibly add a few hours to her
                  miserable existence; but even if he could bring her back to life, he would be
                  bestowing no blessing. Life to a drunkard's wife!—it was a curse—a living death—a
                  dying life. Better, far better that she should press the clay-cold pillow of the
                  grave, than that bed of thorns. Yet he did not relinquish his cares. He fed the
                  waning lamp of life with the oil of kindness, and continued to watch by the bed of
                  the sufferer, bathing her temples with water, and moistening her lips with wine.
                  He listened for the footsteps of the drunken husband, but the wretch came not. He
                  was doubtless steeping his soul deeper still in the burning fluid of hell.
                  Mordaunt remembered the soft pressure of the white hand on his arm, and wished he
                  had sooner felt its warning touch.</p>
               <p>About midnight, the poor, weak pulse his fingers pressed suddenly stopped, and
                  Mordaunt found himself alone with the dead. As the inexpressible calm and
                  placidity of death stole over the features, restoring something of youthfulness
                  and beauty, and the charm of a great and solemn mystery rested upon them, he
                  looked upon her with a strange<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6687-00000033"/> interest.
                  The human frame was to him a wondrous and curious machine, a God-constructed,
                  glorious instrument. He looked upon it with the eyes of science, and whether
                  clothed in rags or fine linen, he recognized the hand of the Divine Architect.</p>
               <p>But what must he do? Whom could he summon to that death-tenanted chamber? The <hi
                     rend="i"/>Evening Star was now shedding its soft, pitying rays over another
                  couch of suffering, that couch which his ministrations might also have soothed.
                  Just as he was rising, resolved to rouse the inmates of the next cabin, and induce
                  them to attend to the last duties of humanity, the door opened and Hannah quietly
                  entered. She was a grave, respectable-looking woman, and seemed to understand at
                  one glance the office that devolved upon her. Mordaunt felt as if his mission was
                  now ended, and he was glad that it was so.</p>
               <p>"How is the gentleman? How is Mr. Goldman?" asked he. "Is he very badly hurt?"</p>
               <p>"Dreadfully, sir. His leg and arm are broken, and he is shockingly bruised,
                  besides. You can hear him groan all over the house."</p>
               <p>"And the young lady?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Constance? She is with her uncle. She will not leave him, though the doctors
                  all urge her to go, and she looks ready to drop down, too."</p>
               <p>"Has he many doctors with him?"</p>
               <p>"There are three below—enough to kill him, I am sure," added she, in a kind of
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"I might have been one of that favoured trio," thought Mordaunt, "and now the
                  weight of my last dollar is added to the millstone of sin that is dragging a
                  wretch to the abyss of perdition. But I meant to do good. God forgive me for
                  repining."</p>
               <p>The history of the drunkard and his wife has nothing to do with our story, only as
                  it serves to illustrate the character of our young physician, and to introduce him
                  to Constance Goldman, one of those angels of mercy whom God sometimes sends into
                  the world to drop balm into the wounds that sin has made, and to strew with roses
                  and lilies the thorny path that leads to the grave.</p>
               <p>Days and weeks passed away. Mordaunt continued to struggle on—to struggle on the
                  very verge of penury, just able, with the strictest economy, to pay his daily
                  expenses. His practice was extending, but chiefly among the poor, whose scanty
                  purse he felt unwilling to diminish. He was gaining experience but losing hope.
                  His youthful appearance was a bar to his success. He had a strong desire to cut
                  off his bright, brown locks, which had a most obstinate and provoking wave, and
                  assume a venerable-looking wig; to cover his sunny, hazel eyes with a pair of
                  green spectacles, and wear an expression of supernatural gravity and intense
                  wisdom. Every thing short of this, he did, to make himself older, but in vain. The
                  fire of youth was burning in the temple of life, and it illuminated all
                  surrounding objects.</p>
               <p>Once, when he was walking with Wiley, (for, uncongenial as they were, they were
                  frequent companions,) a carriage stopped at the door of a splendid<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000034"/> mansion just before them. A lady descended, whom he
                  immediately recognized as the <hi rend="i"/>Evening Star. The gray cloud no longer
                  enveloped her graceful figure, which was robed in all the elegance of fashion. The
                  face was less pale and sad than when he saw her last, but still wore that
                  celestial fairness which is seldom warmed with the colouring of earth. Mordaunt
                  bowed low to the recognizing glance, while Wiley stepped forward with the freedom
                  of an old acquaintance, and offered his assistance in leading her up the flight of
                  marble steps which led to the door.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt felt a sudden swelling of the heart against Wiley. He could not help it,
                  though he despised himself for it. He knew by intuition that Constance would speak
                  to him. He felt that he was not forgotten. Though her cheek, like the pure
                  asbestos, kindled not at his approach, her eye had beamed with a modest but joyous
                  welcome. He knew by intuition also that Wiley's cold and biting tongue would
                  wither like frost every kindly sentiment she might now perchance feel for him. He
                  did not dream that she had fallen in love with him, for he was not vain or
                  presumptuous, but, associated as they had been in the holy task of mercy and
                  compassion, he could not help thinking there was a sympathy between them, which he
                  could not bear to have chilled. He did not want his name to be mentioned in her
                  presence by the lips of Wiley. But why should he suffer his equanimity to be
                  disturbed by such illusions? She might not condescend to mention him. She was
                  compassionate, and looked kindly on him, when she had met him in the hovel of the
                  poor, but should he seek her in her own lordly home, the rich heiress might chill
                  with her indifference (he could not associate with her the idea of
                     <emph>scorn</emph>) the poor young physician. Mordaunt, in spite of his
                  elasticity and hopefulness of spirit, was beginning to feel a little of the
                  sickness of hope deferred. He had observed that morning, with rather sorrowful
                  misgivings, that his best coat was a little more lustrous at the elbows than it
                  was when he first wore it, and that the silken down of his hat was getting a
                  little shorter and somewhat worn; especially on the rim in front, which he touched
                  when making his graceful bows. There was nothing yet to detract from the gentility
                  of his appearance, but he knew a day would come when the coat would grow rusty and
                  the hat napless, and unless he had more profitable patients than the drunkard's
                  poor wife, it would be long before he could purchase others. He entered his
                  office, took off his hat, smoothed it carefully with the sleeve of his coat before
                  he hung it on the peg, then exchanging his coat for a student's wrapper, he threw
                  himself into a chair, waked up the dying coals in the grate, and folding his arms,
                  gazed steadfastly on a majestic skeleton that stood in a corner of the room,
                  silent but awful guardian of its solitude.</p>
               <p>"Hail, grim companion," he exclaimed; "teacher, monitor, and friend! Hail, lonely
                  palace of a departed king. No—empty cage of a liberated captive. How often has the
                  poor prisoner beat in agony against the marble bars of his prison-house,
                  struggling for release! How often has the proud monarch revelled in pride<pb
                     n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6687-00000035"/> behind that white, gleaming lattice-work!
                  Strange! for six thousand years the great Architect of the universe has been
                  building domes like these, frail, wondrous, glorious, but perishable—perishable
                  temples of the imperishable—corruptible homes of incorruption; and for six
                  thousand years to come, perchance, the same magnificent structures will rise and
                  continue to rise, mocking the genius and invention of man. It is a proud thought
                  that we, masters of the divine art of healing, are able to cheat time and the
                  grave of their inalienable right, and preserve from decay and ruin fabrics more
                  grand than Egyptian or Grecian art ever fashioned. Yes! ours <emph>is</emph> a
                  noble art, and I exult that I am one of its disciples. But, alas! I am still very
                  poor; and O! the irremediable disgrace that still clings to my name!"</p>
               <p>We will leave Mordaunt for a while with the grim companion whom he makes the
                  confidant of his wild, deep thoughts, and follow Wiley into the dwelling of the
                  modern Crœsus.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Mr. Goldman, who was still suffering from his broken limbs, reclined upon a couch,
                  near the fire. Wiley sat by his side; Constance, at a little distance. Wiley, when
                  he wished to please, had the most insinuating manners, and he had a strong desire
                  to please the uncle of Constance. He felt confident of success with him, but there
                  was something about Constance he could not fathom. A holy serenity, a passionless
                  calm, over which the breath of admiration flowed like a cloud over crystal,
                  leaving no impression on its pure, smooth surface. As she now sat, looking into
                  the fire, with a soft languor diffused over her features, he was flattering
                  himself that he might be the subject of her waking dream, when she startled him
                  with the question, in her peculiarly sweet, low tone of voice—</p>
               <p>"Who is the young gentleman who was your companion this evening?"</p>
               <p>"It was young Doctor Mordaunt," answered Wiley, vexed at finding another than
                  himself the subject of her reverie. "But surely he could not have had the
                  presumption to bow, as an entire stranger?"</p>
               <p>"He is not an entire stranger, nor do I believe that he would be guilty of
                  presumption, under any circumstances," replied Constance, with a slight shade of
                  haughtiness.</p>
               <p>"Who is that you are speaking of?" asked Mr. Goldman, whose ear caught the sound
                  of doctor. "Doctor Mordaunt? I never heard of him. Is he a distinguished
                  physician?"</p>
               <p>"He is a young tyro," answered Wiley, "a true Don Quixote in his profession. To
                  show you what chance he has of arriving at distinction, I will mention an
                  incident, connected with him, in which you, sir, have a personal interest. The
                  night when you were thrown from the carriage, and your footman came rushing
                  through the street, in frantic haste for a doctor, ready to seize the first he
                  could grasp, I was walking with Mordaunt, and while I bewailed your misfortune, I
                  could not help rejoicing at such a magnificent opening<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000036"/> for him, knowing your unbounded influence, and the
                  eclat it would give him to be employed even accidentally by you. Would you believe
                  it, sir, he refused to follow your servant, refused to administer to your
                  relief——"</p>
               <p>"Refused?" exclaimed Mr. Goldman, with an air of surprise and displeasure. "This
                  is very unaccountable behaviour. Did he know who I am? Or did he imagine I was
                  some poor wretch, who could not pay him for his services?"</p>
               <p>I told him who you were, sir, and that it was a life of no common value that was
                  endangered. But because he had promised a few moments before to prescribe for the
                  wife of a vile drunkard, who with reeling step arrested us in our path, a creature
                  too low to be considered within the pale of humanity, he turned a deaf ear to the
                  tale of your sufferings, and allowed <emph>her</emph> life to outweigh
                     <emph>yours,</emph> in the scale of his judgment."</p>
               <p>"Fool!" exclaimed Mr. Goldman.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he put his promise in the scale to balance the temptation," said
                  Constance. "Of course he is wealthy, or he would not slight a golden
                  opportunity."</p>
               <p>"Not worth a cent in the world," answered Wiley, "and, what is more, never will
                  be."</p>
               <p>"Uncle," said Constance, with a sudden lighting up of her fair, calm face, a
                  splendour, not a glow, "when I tell you what I know of this young Doctor Mordaunt,
                  you will withdraw the opprobrious epithet you have given him. The night of your
                  dreadful accident, I was with poor Kate O'Brien, when he visited her, and I was
                  struck with the kindness of his manner, and the heartiness of his sympathy. It
                  seemed to me that he was skilful, and that he felt as much interest in her
                  recovery as if a great reward were to be his. Kate O'Brien, sir," added she,
                  looking toward Wiley, with a glance he could not understand, "was a favourite
                  servant of my mother's. My mother had her from childhood in her household, and
                  loved her almost as her child. She was faithful, gentle, and affectionate. Ever
                  since her unfortunate marriage she has lived near us, an object of interest and
                  compassion. She was worthy of the profoundest pity, whatever may be said of her
                  miserable husband. That Doctor Mordaunt should conscientiously adhere to his
                  promise of visiting the poor and lowly, in the face of a strong temptation, is, I
                  think, a noble instance of generosity and self-sacrifice. I esteemed him before—I
                  honour him now."</p>
               <p>"And what is this young doctor to you, that you defend him so warmly, Constance?"
                  cried her uncle, looking suspiciously on her shining countenance, for it literally
                  shone with moral admiration.</p>
               <p>"To me, nothing, uncle; but the cause is every thing."</p>
               <p>"What cause?"</p>
               <p>"The cause of truth, and justice, and humanity. I thought if you and Mr. Wiley
                  understood the circumstances which I have related, they would vindicate Dr.
                  Mordaunt from the charges of Quixotism and folly. Uncle, <emph>you</emph> was
                  attached to poor Kate—I was summoned to your bed of agony—her brutal husband<pb
                     n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6687-00000037"/> forsook her—this young man remained with
                  her till she died. Even then, he watched by her lonely corse. Hannah found him
                  guarding it, as a sacred trust——"</p>
               <p>Constance paused. She had spoken with more energy than she was aware of, and a
                  faint colour dawned perceptibly on her alabaster cheek.</p>
               <p>Wiley, exasperated to find that, instead of lowering Mordaunt, he had only exalted
                  him in her estimation, rose to depart. Constance drew a sigh of relief as the door
                  closed on his departing figure. Mr. Goldman looked anxious and irritated.</p>
               <p>"You have displeased him, Constance."</p>
               <p>"I care not, uncle. His displeasure or approbation are alike to me."</p>
               <p>"He loves you. He has wealth and talents and a rising reputation. I do not like to
                  see you blind to his merits, and infatuated by those of a poor stranger. I wish to
                  speak to you openly, Constance. I do not think I shall ever recover from the shock
                  my constitution has received. It is time that I should transfer my guardianship to
                  another. Wiley is rich himself, and cannot be allured by your fortune. His
                  attachment is disinterested and sincere, yet he has sufficient worldly wisdom to
                  watch over your property, and his sobriety, prudence, and good sense, will secure
                  your domestic happiness. I like Wiley. I wish you to marry him."</p>
               <p>"I do not like him, uncle. I do not wish to marry him, or any one else. His
                  worldly wisdom chills the very atmosphere I breathe. If I ever do marry, it shall
                  not be a man of dollars and cents, a man without one warm and generous affection,
                  one noble, magnanimous feeling. Kate O'Brien, the drunkard's wife, was not more
                  worthy of pity than I should be. Her heart was crushed—mine would be frozen."</p>
               <p>"Constance," said her uncle, suddenly raising himself on one elbow, then falling
                  back with a groan of pain, "if you have conceived a sudden passion for this young
                  doctor, I will never countenance it; I warn you against this folly. It shall be
                  blasted in the very bud."</p>
               <p>"Oh! uncle, have you so poor an opinion of me as to believe me incapable of an
                  unselfish, generous sentiment? I am not one to be governed by the impulse of
                  passion. You know I am not. I am called the snow-maiden, because I am deemed so
                  cold and unimpressible. I do feel interested in this young physician, for he has
                  shown himself magnanimous and strong to resist temptation. A noble spirit
                  struggling with destiny is worthy of admiration. I would give worlds to hold out
                  to him a helping hand. I would give any thing that I were a man, that I could
                  offer him a brother's aid, a friend's assistance. I feel guilty in the possession
                  of wealth, so far beyond my want, when it might serve as a golden ladder, on which
                  a great soul could mount to the heights of honour and distinction."</p>
               <p>"You are a strange girl, Constance. I do not understand you," cried her uncle,
                  feeling through the icy coldness of his nature, in spite of his own will, the
                  penetrative sun-rays of her own philanthropy. He said he could not understand her,
                  but he did<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6687-00000038"/> in some measure. He understood
                  her enough to know that she was misled by no girlish fancy, no unmaidenly passion,
                  but actuated by a high and holy benevolence. He listened to her with more
                  patience, on that couch of suffering, to which she had been a waiting, ministering
                  angel, than he would have done in his days of health and ease.</p>
               <p>"Uncle," she added, fixing her clear, serene eyes on his face, and taking his thin
                  hand in the soft palms of hers, "you are a man, and can do what I cannot. You are
                  rich—one of the stewards of God's gold. You can take this young man by the hand
                  and lift him above the influences of poverty, so chilling and depressing to the
                  young and ambitious mind. You said this morning that you did not like Doctor
                  Lewis, that he was careless and indifferent, that he would not listen to your
                  complaints, and seemed to think you had no right to make them."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did say so," interrupted Mr. Goldman, "and I say so again. He never stays
                  with me longer than three minutes, treats me like a common patient."</p>
               <p>"He has too many patients, uncle. You are of no consequence to him. Your money is
                  no more to him than any other man's. If you should employ this young doctor, he
                  would be grateful and attentive. You would have the satisfaction of feeling that
                  you were doing him a favour, perhaps laying the foundation of his future eminence.
                  You would be the honoured patron of youthful talent and now unknown worth. You
                  would exult in your own works. O! uncle, it is not what we do for ourselves, but
                  others, that is written in the Book of Life."</p>
               <p>"You say he was very kind to poor Kate?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! so kind and compassionate! No brother could have been kinder."</p>
               <p>"What would Doctor Lewis say?"</p>
               <p>"I think he would rejoice, for the sake of the young man. He is too eminent in his
                  profession to indulge in the meanness of jealousy."</p>
               <p>"What will Wiley say?"</p>
               <p>"Wiley! Let him say what he pleases. He is envious, and I despise him. He is
                  malicious, and I dislike him. He is cold-hearted, and I shun him. He is
                  avaricious, and cares not for me, but my wealth. Believe me, uncle, he is unworthy
                  of your confidence. The lips that, cold and sarcastic, can breathe the venom of
                  slander on an absent brother, never shall address the words of love to me."</p>
               <p>"Brother?"</p>
               <p>"All mankind are brothers, uncle. O! I feel the chain that binds me to my race. I
                  cannot bear to think that mine should be made of links of gold, and others of
                  galling iron. There will come a day of great equality, uncle. Blessed are those
                  who labour in this world to establish the equilibrium here, which will settle at
                  last on the meeting waves of the great human mind."</p>
               <p>Mr. Goldman cast a look of perplexity and admiration on his niece. He could not
                  follow the divine aspirations of her spirit. He even felt awe in her presence. She
                  seemed scarcely of the earth, earthy.<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6687-00000039"/> How
                  came this young girl by these holy sentiments, surrounded by such worldly
                  influences? Cast in the fiery furnace of temptation, with the dangerous gifts of
                  beauty, wealth, and genius, how is it that she walked unscathed 'mid the scorching
                  flames, serene and unmoved? Was it that one in the likeness of the Son of God
                  walked with her, as he did with the children of Israel, and disarmed the elements
                  of the world of their destroying power?</p>
               <p>"How shall I send for this young doctor?" suddenly asked Mr. Goldman. "Do you know
                  where he resides?"</p>
               <p>"We have a <title>Directory.</title> I will get it.</p>
               <p>Constance sought the book, and immediately ascertained the location of the young
                  physician.</p>
               <p>"I will try him, Constance. If I do not like him, I shall dismiss him. Remember,
                  it is only an experiment."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, dear uncle. I ask no more. Thank you a thousand times for this kind
                  concession. It is good, it is noble of you. If you find him unskillful, it will be
                  your duty to withdraw your influence, for life is too precious to be lightly dealt
                  with, and yours most of all. Good-night."</p>
               <p>She bent and kissed the forehead of her uncle with unusual tenderness. He drew her
                  gently nearer and nearer, till she was rested against his heart. He folded his
                  uninjured arm around her, and laid his hand on her smooth, soft hair.</p>
               <p>"Constance," said he, "you are a good girl—too good for this world. I wish there
                  were more like you. It is very strange, when talking with Wiley, I feel as hard
                  and worldly as he seems to be. When listening to you, I seem a different being.
                  The monitor within responds to your sweet accents. When I mingled with the world,
                  every thing around me wore a bright metallic glare. I found myself valued for my
                  wealth, and I took a pride in its possession. Why should I not glory in what gave
                  me power and influence? Since I have been confined to this couch, and when I am
                  alone with you, my better nature rises and sometimes triumphs. Good-night. God
                  bless you, Constance."</p>
               <p>"And you too, dear uncle."</p>
               <p>A tear, which glittered on the fringed curtain of her eyes, fell on the cheek of
                  the invalid, as she turned from the couch. It was only deep emotion that could
                  draw tears from the eyes of Constance. Her feelings were not upon the surface.
                  They were far down in the "sunless retreats of the ocean" of thought.</p>
               <p>The next day, when Doctor Lewis called, Constance perceived a shade of
                  embarrassment on her uncle's countenance, and she hastened to relieve him.</p>
               <p>"Doctor Lewis," said she, as he turned hastily to the door, "I will not detain you
                  long. It will give you neither disappointment or displeasure if uncle should free
                  you from your attendance on him? Thanks to your skill, he is no longer in danger.
                  There is a promising young physician whom he wishes to patronize. His name is
                  Mordaunt. Has he your permission to do so?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," he replied, with a look of mingled<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000040"/> pleasure and surprise. "I like your frankness. I
                  have heard of this young man. He <emph>is</emph> promising. I am glad to hear of
                  his good fortune."</p>
               <p>His countenance expressed more than his words; but Constance did not blush or cast
                  down her eyes. She related in a few words all that she knew of Mordaunt, and that
                  it was owing to her persuasions that her uncle had been induced to employ him.</p>
               <p>The simplicity and frankness of her manner convinced the doctor of the purity and
                  elevation of her motives. He was not a cold, unfeeling man. He had not time to
                  express his feelings. The burden of a great responsibility rested upon him, and it
                  made him grave and thoughtful. If he made hurried calls at the rich man's bedside,
                  where his attentions were needed least of all, he often stayed hours in the hovels
                  of the poor. Nothing rejoiced him more than to hear of the rising fame of some
                  young brother in the practice, but he had not time to exert himself for their
                  interests. He had met Mordaunt a short time before, in the suburbs of the city, at
                  the house of a poor German, and he was much pleased with the young man. So he told
                  Constance, and a smile of approbaillumined his countenance as he did so.</p>
               <p>"When I was a young man," said he, laying his hand on the latch, "I had many a
                  hard struggle with the world. I know how to sympathize with these young wrestlers.
                  Tell Doctor Mordaunt so, and tell him to call and see me. I shall be glad to know
                  him better."</p>
               <p>And he did know him better, and became his firm friend and disinterested
                  counsellor. And Mr. Goldman was charmed with the young physician, and sounded his
                  praises in every ear.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt had indeed cast his bread upon the waters when he visited the dying wife
                  of the drunkard, and gave away his only dollar in the hope of stimulating her
                  exhausted energies. He did not know, when he entered that wretched abode, that
                  there sat the angel who was to stir the stagnant waters of his life. But it was
                  even so.</p>
               <p>Now, he knew that he was indebted to Constance for the sudden flow of prosperity
                  that came rolling in the dry and sandy channel of poverty; for the dawning
                  sunshine that shone on the night-cloud of despondency; for the glorious hope of
                  future distinction that now animated his being. He was not vain, and never
                  believed for a moment that personal admiration for himself had prompted the
                  generous interposition of Constance in his behalf. Neither did he impute it to
                     compassion—<emph>that</emph> would have humiliated him—but to a just
                  appreciation of his character, learned by that intuition of woman's heart which
                  the philosopher admits, though he cannot explain.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt had an exalted estimate of woman. He adored his mother, and dearly loved
                  his gentle sister (for he had a mother and sister, who dwelt far away, in a sweet
                  country village), and in every lovely young female he recognized a sister's form.
                  For Constance he felt an admiration so chastened by reverence, it was less like
                  the feeling that youth and beauty inspires than what the worshipper feels for his
                     guardian<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6687-00000041"/> saint. It was not love, for
                  she indeed seemed the <emph>snow-maiden</emph>—too pure and too cold to be warmed
                  by the breath of human passion. He experienced in her presence a feeling of divine
                  repose, a kind of moon-light quietude; for such was her exquisite purity, her holy
                  spirituality, that she diffused around her a kind of silvery brightness that threw
                  a soft, illusive charm on all within the sphere of her influence.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt's practice was now rapidly extending among the rich and influential,
                  among those who could appreciate his merits, as well as reward his services. He no
                  longer looked with anxious eye on the sleeve of his coat, or the rim of his hat.
                  He could afford to buy new ones. He was no longer poor, no longer unknown. His
                  mind, liberated from the iron fetters of poverty, and unchilled by the vapours of
                  obscurity, was conscious of an expansion, a warmth, an elevation unknown before.
                  He became strongly attached to Doctor Lewis, who, in his now familiar intercourse
                  with the young man, displayed a geniality of feeling, more winning from the
                  contrast with the prevailing reserve and dignity of his character.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt occasionally met Wiley, in whose breast the gall of jealousy was added to
                  the venom of envy. Himself the now rejected lover of Constance, he hated the man
                  who, he believed, had rivalled him in her affections. He did not discontinue his
                  visits at Mr. Goldman's. He asked to retain the privileges of a friend, though
                  denied far dearer rights. He wanted to watch the progress of Mordaunt, and, if
                  possible, undermine the stately fabric of his growing fame.</p>
               <p>"Every man," said he, "has some weak, vulnerable point, some spot that the Styx of
                  Stoicism has not bathed. Mordaunt is proud. Let the barbed arrow pierce him
                  through his pride, and the wound will prey upon his life."</p>
               <p>The soul of Mordaunt had a vulnerable spot, but it was one of which Wiley never
                  dreamed, a spot where the arrow would indeed penetrate deep as the core of life.
                  But time had folded its layers thickly over it, and the man at times forgot what
                  had well nigh maddened the boy.</p>
               <p>The age of a tree is known by the consecutive circles that are formed round the
                  heart of the trunk, and it takes many a stroke of the sharpest axe to reach that
                  guarded part.</p>
               <p>Thus, year after year had wrapped round the <emph>quick</emph> of Mordaunt's heart
                  a deeper coating, rendering it more inaccessible to external injury. He was far
                  removed from the associations of the past, and on that <emph>one subject</emph>
                  the lips of memory were hermetically sealed.</p>
               <p>One evening, Doctor Lewis came into his office at a late hour. Wiley was sitting
                  there, leaning back against the wall, on the back-ground of a dark cloak, so that
                  his figure was not at first distinguishable. Mordaunt was in an abstracted mood,
                  and apparently forgetful of the presence of one whom his nature avoided with a
                  strong, electric repulsion.</p>
               <p>"Come to my office, Mordaunt," said Doctor Lewis, laying his hand familiarly on
                  his shoulder; "I have a glorious subject—the criminal who was executed this<pb
                     n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6687-00000042"/> morning. He is certainly one of the
                  noblest specimens of humanity, as far as the outward man is concerned, I have ever
                  seen."</p>
               <p>An expression of sickening horror passed over Mordaunt's countenance. He shrunk
                  involuntarily from the hand laid in kindness upon him. Doctor Lewis beheld him
                  with surprise and disappointment.</p>
               <p>"I thought you would welcome such an opportunity," said he, rather coldly. "You
                  surely must have conquered ere this that morbid sensibility that recoils from an
                  act which the wants of science demand, which philanthropy sanctions and religion
                  approves. The man who has violated the laws of God makes an expiation greater than
                  his life, when he yields his body to the scalpel, which explores the winding
                  mysteries of vitality. Living he may be the scourge, dead, the benefactor of
                  mankind."</p>
               <p>"Doctor," replied Mordaunt, and his usually sunny eye was darkened and overcast,
                  "I would far rather disturb the awful slumbers of the grave than touch the poor
                  victim of man's unrighteous judgment. He was condemned and executed on
                  circumstantial evidence alone. Such a decision is not lawful. It is often murder
                  of the most cruel, deliberate kind. I believe him innocent. I would not make a
                  sacrifice of his body to save my own from burning flames."</p>
               <p>Wiley leaned forward from his darkened corner and gazed with intense curiosity on
                  the pale and excited face of Mordaunt. Why should he feel so painful an interest
                  in the fate of a nameless malefactor factor? What was his guilt or innocence to
                  him? It was not merely abstract sympathy with his race which could extinguish the
                  colour of his cheek, and quench so suddenly the light of his eye.</p>
               <p>Wiley, the naturally cold and envious, the deliberately jealous and now malignant
                  Wiley, watched his victim with feline subtlety and dissimulation. He had
                  discovered a wire which communicated with the vital, <emph>vulnerable</emph> part
                  he had been so long seeking. And he twisted and twisted it round the screw of
                  memory, ready to draw it and tug at it, till the heart's blood came oozing, drop
                  by drop, exposing the inner wound.</p>
               <p>"I will not urge you to-night," said Doctor Lewis, taking leave of Mordaunt with a
                  serious kindness of manner, which made the young man grasp his hand with
                  unconscious warmth. "I see you are nervous, and I fear seriously indisposed. We
                  cannot always command our will, and every one, I believe, has some strange,
                  unaccountable weakness, which has its ebbs and flows like the moon-ruled
                  tide."</p>
               <p>"I fear you think me weak, doctor," replied Mordaunt, "but do not judge me without
                  a hearing. I will not detain you now. Some time, when you are entirely at leisure,
                  I will tell you something of the history of my early life. A terrible shock,
                  received in childhood, will make the electric chord vibrate in long, after
                  years."</p>
               <p>When Doctor Lewis had left the office, Mordaunt resumed his seat, and leaning his
                  elbows on the table,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6687-00000043"/> pressed his
                  forehead upon his hand, bending his head so that his hair fell in thick masses
                  over his brow. There was perfect silence in the apartment. The lamp-light fell
                  with a strong glare on the ghastly framework of life gleaming cold and white in
                  its dim recess, and threw the shadow of Mordaunt darkly on the floor.</p>
               <p>Wiley looked at the shadow and smiled, then softly rising, he approached the young
                  physician, and said, in his usual cool, passionless tone—</p>
               <p>"You do not seem well to-night, Mordaunt. Can I do any thing for you?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," replied Mordaunt haughtily. Then, with a sudden change of voice, he
                  added—"Pardon me, I thought you had left me."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you refused to accompany Doctor Lewis," said Wiley. I have more
                  sympathy with your scrupulous humanity than with his cold, abstract love of
                  science."</p>
               <p>"I have not been actuated by humanity," said Mordaunt, hastily. "I will not accept
                  unmerited commendation, if <emph>you</emph> consider it such. But <emph>I</emph>
                  do not. I look upon Doctor Lewis as the high-priest of humanity. He is a votary of
                  science only as he is a lover of mankind."</p>
               <p>"Why did you tell him that you would not make a sacrifice of the body of that man,
                  believing him innocent, to save your own from consuming fire."</p>
               <p>"Because," replied the young man with energy, "he probably has friends, who are
                  watching with agonizing anxiety to pay to his poor remains those holy rites
                  immemorial time has hallowed. His blackened name, his awful doom, the rope, the
                  scaffold, and the hangman's gripe cannot divorce the victim from their affections
                  and sympathies. The sanctity of a Christian burial heals the gaping wound caused
                  by a violent and ignominious death. Who would rob the wretched survivors of so
                  poor a consolation? Who would deprive them of a home for their bitter tears? A
                  turf to make green with the dew of sorrow? Those who die in the arms of their
                  kindred, who are laid quietly and reverently in their six-feet bed of earth, with
                  the balm of prayer and praise, what matters it to them if their sanctified dust be
                  made to add to the glory of science and the good of man? What matters it to them,
                  whether their bones moulder beneath the clods of the valley, or bleach in the
                  sunshine of heaven? Friends never go to pierce into the mystery of the
                  charnel-house. Affection shrinks back from its cold threshold. The wreath may hang
                  on the marble urn—the tablet gleam with golden characters. Love, sorrow, memory
                  ask no more."</p>
               <p>"Some of his kindred have died upon the scaffold," said Wiley to himself, passing
                  his hand over his eyes to hide the triumphant malice of their beams. "I know it as
                  well as if I had seen their bodies swinging between heaven and earth. Constance
                  shall know it, too."</p>
               <p>"For myself," continued Mordaunt, in a still more excited tone, "I care not what
                  becomes of this clay temple of mine when the indwelling Deity is departed. Earth,
                  fire, flood may claim their own, for it will resolve<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000044"/> solve at last into its original elements. The soul,
                  the enfranchised angel, what cares it for the poor remnant, the broken chains, the
                  badges of sorrow and slavery it leaves behind?"</p>
               <p>We will leave Mordaunt to his own reflections; for when the door closed on Wiley,
                  he suddenly extinguished his lamp and wrapped himself in darkness, as with a
                  mantle. The memories of childhood rolled back in a black flood, lashed into
                  billows, drowning the joys of the present, the hopes of the future; even the
                  serene and holy light of the <hi rend="i"/>Evening Star could not disperse the
                  thick gloom that followed in the wake of those cold waters. It only made their
                  shadows more appalling. The dark hour was on him, the eclipse of the soul, for the
                  first time since the evening which introduced him to Constance Goldman.</p>
               <p>Yes, every mortal that has a soul to feel, has their dark hours. Sometimes the
                  night-cloud comes we know not whence, and goes we know not whither. Sometimes it
                  is the shadow of a mighty sorrow, a sorrow rising gravely and gloomily above the
                  landscape of life—still existing, though years may have stretched their space
                  between.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt's own nature was too bright and sunny for that mysterious, spirit-woe so
                  many are doomed to feel; but the dark mountain, whose shade had fallen on the
                  green fields and flowery vales of childhood, still loomed upon his sight, through
                  the dimness of distance and the mists of time.</p>
               <p>Not many days after the scene we have described in Mordaunt's office, he was met
                  by Wiley at the house of Mr. Goldman, who was still an invalid. Wiley exerted
                  himself more than usual to shine in the conversation that evening, and his
                  apparent warmth of feeling nearly surprised Mordaunt into an inward
                  acknowledgement that he had wronged this man's nature; that it might possess some
                  of the finer traits hitherto lying beneath or beyond the observation of the world.
                  By imperceptible degrees, and with consummate art, he led the conversation through
                  many tributary streams into the channel that suited his purpose.</p>
               <p>Pride of birth and station had been touched upon lightly, and Wiley had maintained
                  that the aristocracy of intellect was the only true aristocracy—the one that
                  would, sooner or later, be universally acknowledged and respected. There was
                  something noble, he said, in the efforts of a young man to rise above the
                  misfortunes of his early life. But no honest man should be ashamed of his
                  parentage.</p>
               <p>To his propositions, deferentially stated, and skilfully reasoned, he gained the
                  assent of even the aristocratic Mr. Goldman.</p>
               <p>"But," said Wiley, glancing keenly towards Mordaunt, "suppose that in addition to
                  his poverty, a dark stain rested on the family of a young man, and, concealing all
                  knowledge of the circumstances of his early history, he should strive to
                  ingratiate himself into the favour of his superiors, and attaint their skirts with
                  the blackness that clung to his own."</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6687-00000045"/>
               <p>"I know such an one," he continued, "who even aspires to the hand of a young lady
                  far above him. He has partially succeeded in impressing her with the belief that
                  he is a man of noble sentiments and qualities, that his impulses and aspirations
                  are like her own, that his genius, talents, and acquirements are a fair offset to
                  her possessions and proud name, and that an alliance with him would secure to her
                  happiness and peace. He hides from her his history, which he would fain bury in
                  the oblivion of the past; he hides from her the truth that his name would bring
                  dishonour upon her and those connected with her by the dearest ties; he hides from
                  her that he is seeking this marriage to gild over that name that has been stained
                  with a dreadful crime; in short, he hides from her the fact that his own father
                  perished ignominiously upon the scaffold! Is this honourable?"</p>
               <p>It was not till after the words died away that the spirit felt their reptile
                  influence.</p>
               <p>Constance had answered—"No, it is not honourable," before this influence was
                  perceptible on herself. She observed the eye of Wiley fixed steadily on Mordaunt,
                  who was seated at her side, and an impulse which she could not resist urged her to
                  turn and look upon him.</p>
               <p>As she did so, she met his glance, and her own was riveted, as by fascination.
                  Never had she seen the face of man of such marble pallor. Never had she witnessed
                  such an expression of sternness and despair on any human countenance. And yet,
                  flashing through this sternness and despair there was a suddenly denly kindled,
                  burning ray, quick, bright and fierce, as the meteor of a dark night. In that
                  momentary communion of glances, a history was revealed which volumes might not
                  contain.</p>
               <p>You have seen the lightning instantaneously opening the gates of midnight, while
                  stretching beyond seemed interminable fiery streets, glimpses of the eternal land.
                  So ofttimes the lightning of strong emotion discloses the mysterious depths of the
                  soul, "that city of our God," whose length and breadth no gauger's wand has ever
                  measured.</p>
               <p>For one moment the face of Constance was bloodless as his own, then, quickly and
                  gushingly as the blood follows the stroke of the lancet, the warm current rushed
                  over her cheek and brow. It was like the breaking up of an ice-bound stream, when
                  the waves leap from their prison-bonds, or rather (with reverence we use the
                  comparison), like the miracle of Cana, when the hueless water "owned its God and
                  blushed."</p>
               <p>Mr. Goldman, whose easy chair was placed a little back from the group, and who
                  beheld not the emotions we have described, repeated with emphasis the words of
                  Constance—</p>
               <p>"No, it is not honourable. It is not pardonable. I could pity, nay, esteem the
                  young man who, making no secret of his misfortune, endeavoured to make himself an
                  unblemished fame. But I never would forgive the one who deceived my confidence and
                  tried to introduce into my family a dishonoured name. Who is the young man of whom
                  you are speaking?"</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6687-00000046"/>
               <p>"I, sir, am that unfortunate man," exclaimed Mordaunt, to the astonishment of
                  Wiley, rising from his seat, and turning towards Mr. Goldman; "but I have never
                  sought to deceive the confidence of my friends. I have merely been silent on a
                  misfortune for which sympathy has no balm, and friendship no relief. I acknowledge
                  that in scenes far from my native home I have endeavoured to forget that I bore a
                  dishonoured name, and to make for myself an irreproachable reputation. But it was
                  for no foul, deliberate crime that my unhappy parent was doomed to a death of
                  shame. The victim of a dark and inscrutable destiny, he left on the minds of all
                  who knew him a conviction of his innocence as clear and ineffaceable as if the
                  testimony were written with a diamond pen on a tablet of crystal.</p>
               <p>"This gentleman, with a penetration that does more honour to his head than his
                  heart, has discovered the secret, which I have guarded from no mean or unworthy
                  motives. Why he has taken this opportunity to disclose it, in a manner the
                  tortures of the inquisition could not have surpassed, he alone knows."</p>
               <p>"I mentioned no names," cried Wiley, evidently disconcerted by the undaunted
                  frankness of Mordaunt; "if conscience has directed the application, I neither
                  claim the merit nor assume the blame."</p>
               <p>"Really, gentlemen, this is a most extraordinary disclosure," said Mr. Goldman,
                  turning pale from the excitement of his feelings, "I know not when my nerves have
                  received so sudden and severe a shock. Doctor Mordaunt, I have never met with a
                  young gentleman whom I have esteemed more, but these unfortunate fortunate
                  circumstances—you should have made them known to me sooner. I am placed in a very
                  distressing position."</p>
               <p>Here he put his hand to his head with an air of such pain and embarrassment that
                  Constance immediately saturated her handkerchief with cologne and bathed his
                  forehead. She was glad of something to do in a moment of such overwhelming
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>"Let me relieve you of the distress which my presence occasions you, sir," cried
                  Mordaunt. But before I withdraw I would thank you for all past kindness and
                  confidence. I rejoice in the conviction that I have not forfeited either by any
                  conduct of my own. Should you consider me responsible for an event which occurred
                  in my early childhood, and which no acts of my manhood could change, and exclude
                  me hereafter from your friendship and esteem, I must bow to a decision whose
                  justice nevertheless reason and religion could never admit. Farewell, sir. I wish
                  you to reflect calmly on this question, and whatever be the result, gratitude for
                  the past will be permanent as my life."</p>
               <p>With a respectful bow to Mr. Goldman, who did not attempt to reply, and another
                  still lower to Constance, Mordaunt passed from the room without directing a glance
                  at Wiley.</p>
               <p>With slow steps he traversed the long passage, walking over prostrate pillars of
                  moonshine, white and gleaming as marble, thinking that of materials as ghostly and
                  unsubstantial his life-temple must be built.</p>
               <p>As he opened the door, a silver scaffold was plainly<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000047"/> defined upon the floor. He shuddered to see his
                  thoughts thus shaping themselves in the night-glory, when he was arrested by a
                  touch so light as to be almost impalpable. At first he imagined that the moonbeams
                  were gleaming on his arm in the form of a fair and delicate hand, for there it was
                  on the dark sleeve of his coat, just as he had seen it months before in Kate
                  O'Brien's cottage. He turned and beheld the celestial countenance of Constance so
                  near that her breath sighed upon his cheek.</p>
               <p>"Constance!" he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>It was the first time he had ever addressed her thus. It was strange that while
                  the revelation just made seemed to divorce him from mankind, it drew him
                  irresistibly closer toward her. At any other moment he would have thought it
                  presumption to have called her by her own noble and appropriate Christian
                  name.</p>
               <p>"Come into the conservatory a few moments," said she, "unless you are willing to
                  throw aside a friend as lightly as the flower your foot is now crushing."</p>
               <p>A flower had fallen from the bosom of Constance under the feet of Mordaunt, who
                  was unconsciously grinding it in the dust.</p>
               <p>"I hope this is not prophetical," cried Constance in a very low voice, looking on
                  the defaced and mangled blossom.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt followed the steps of Constance, like a man walking in a dream, back
                  through the passage, out into the still splendour of the night, down the granite
                  stairs, till he found himself in a grotto, in the centre of which a beautiful
                  fountain was throwing up its sparkling jets, which descended in the form of a
                  weeping willow, with crystal boughs dropping pearly tears in a marble
                  reservoir.</p>
               <p>Imagination could not conceive a more enchanting spot than this "Fairy's Grotto,"
                  as Constance named it.</p>
               <p>When her uncle erected the magnificent mansion which he now occupied, he allowed
                     <emph>her</emph> taste to luxuriate there in all the prodigality of nature and
                  all the refinement of art. Mordaunt had been admitted before to this lovely
                  retreat, and he was familiar with all its beauties, but now it burst upon him with
                  a loveliness that seemed more than earthly. The rich aroma of the flowers pressed
                  with languishing sweetness on his senses, and the soft, monotonous murmur of the
                  falling fountain mingled with the sad, minor tones of his own spirit, making a
                  mournful but divine harmony.</p>
               <p>They sat down on a circular seat which surrounded the basin, and watched in
                  silence the diamond shower sparkling in the moonlight that turned every drop into
                  a prism, reflecting its radiance. Some of the most beautiful nymphs of mythology
                  stood within the shade of the grotto, and received eternal baptism from the spray.
                  There was one of the daughters of Danaus, holding up her bottomless vase to catch
                  the fountain's waters, hope struggling with despair on her beautiful features, the
                  hope that her expiatory task might yet be accomplished. A lovely Bacchante lifted
                  her ivy-crowned brow and caught a silver<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6687-00000048"
                  /> crown upon its leaves. A Flora, the embodiment of youthful beauty and grace,
                  was represented as scattering flowers on the dewy grass, and all these charming
                  classical figures were reflected in a mirror which constituted a wall on one side,
                  and the willowy fountain with its diamond branches was reflected there also, and
                  two other figures seated side by side cast their images on the illuminated sheet
                  of crystal, which multiplied, as if by enchantment, the fairy scene.</p>
               <p>Constance had thrown around her a light scarf, very airy in texture, but its
                  colour was silver gray, and Mordaunt thought once more of the <hi rend="i"
                  />Evening Star. But now its rays seemed setting instead of rising on the horizon
                  of his destiny.</p>
               <p>"I thank you for this last act of kindness and condescension," said Mordaunt,
                  regretting the next moment that he had spoken at all, for it seemed sacrilege to
                  break the silence, or rather the music, of the hour. "But is it not cruel to bring
                  me here, that I may feel the more fully and deeply what I fear I have for ever
                  lost?"</p>
               <p>"Why should any blessing, yours either by possession or in reversion, be lost to
                  you now?" asked Constance.</p>
               <p>"You know the curse that clings to me, and yet ask why?"</p>
               <p>"I have learned your misfortunes, and, though nobly sustained as they have
                  hitherto been, they will turn to blessings at last. I rejoice that you had the
                  moral courage to avow yourself the object of Wiley's dark insinuations. He is
                  already baffled, and his malice will recoil on himself. And do you know me so
                  little as to believe that the revelations of this night can affect my esteem for
                  you—that I could be so unjust, so cowardly, and unkind—that I could visit on the
                  innocent the crime of the guilty, even if the guilt exist? But I have faith in
                  your father's innocence, because you are his son. I have faith that it will yet be
                  made known to the world, dark as is the cloud which now rests upon it."</p>
               <p>"Ten thousand blessings for this sublime faith," exclaimed Mordaunt, his
                  countenance kindling with inspiration, "and ten thousand blessings for the
                  confidence which has not been shaken by this sudden blow. I feel myself worthy of
                  it, and yet I would not take advantage of it and expose you to the malicious
                  observations of the world. Wiley will blazon abroad the stigma which brands my
                  name. By association, your own will become contaminated. Your uncle will sacrifice
                  me to the god of public opinion. He has not the moral strength to resist its
                  influence. I should expose you to his displeasure, and bring dissension into a now
                  harmonious household."</p>
               <p>"I should be unworthy of the blessings you have just breathed upon me, if I were
                  not willing to brave the evils you are bringing in such dread array before me. O,
                  if you knew how little I care for the opinion of the world, when conscious of
                  right in my own heart, you would feel how inefficient were your arguments, how
                  sophistical your reasoning. The world, as it is called, one true friend would
                  outweigh a hundred-fold in my estimation."</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6687-00000049"/>
               <p>"For my own safety, Constance, then be it. To wish to be more than a friend to you
                  now would be the madness of presumption, and yet so madly presumptuous I am. Nay,
                  so ungrateful, that the friendship which a short time ago I valued as the most
                  precious gift of heaven, would now seem a cake of stone to the prayer of a
                  craving, hungry heart. No," added he, with increasing excitement, "I cannot accept
                  intercourse on such cold terms. I dare not ask it on any other. Therefore, I must
                  leave you. I knew there was a gulf between us, but I would not see it; I made a
                  bridge of flowers over it, and tried to forget that there was an abyss beneath.
                  Wiley has torn away the frail arch. God forgive him—I fear I never can."</p>
               <p>"You murmur at a cake of stone," said Constance, and again the crimson
                  under-current so lately liberated from restraint sent its waves to her cheek, "yet
                  you have never asked for bread."</p>
               <p>And the reserved, nun-like Constance uttered this to the man whose father had
                  perished on the scaffold, and whose name was in consequence irretrievably
                  dishonoured. Yes, and far more, for they sat for hours in that fairy grotto, till <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-3">"Like holy revealings</l>
                        <l>From innermost shrines came the light of their feelings."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mordaunt related all his past history, including the awful tragedy of his father's
                  death. He was then a mere boy, but he remembered well his mother's agony and his
                  sister's despair. He remembered well the last prison-scene, when his father,
                  almost crushing him in his arms, baptized him with tears of blood, as it were,
                  declaring his innocence in the name of that God in whose presence he was about to
                  appear. Years of darkness followed, but light dawned at last. His mother was a
                  brave, Christian woman, and grief did not crush her. She lived for her children.
                  In him, the jubilant spirit of youth at last rose above the gloomy past, that past
                  which began to appear as a frightful dream. Amid new scenes, surrounded with new
                  associations, he ceased to dwell upon it, and, if the shadow intruded, he
                  resolutely dispelled it. There came, however, a time when it rolled down upon him
                  with the blackness of a thunder-storm, and he bowed beneath its weight. It was the
                  night when Doctor Lewis entered his office, and Wiley was witness of emotions his
                  malice too well interpreted.</p>
               <p>"I have explained every thing to Doctor Lewis," said Mordaunt, "and he is more
                  than ever my friend. He has even offered me a partnership in his practice, and
                  given me the most earnest advice to remain."</p>
               <p>"Remain!" repeated Constance. "Surely, you have not thought of leaving us?"</p>
               <p>"Since I have discovered that I have an enemy, the very air I breathe seems
                  contaminated. But now I feel that I can triumph over his malice. With the hopes
                  that now animate me, I could face an opposing world. At this moment I would
                  scarcely rend from my life's history its darkened leaf, for on its black tablet I
                  read in golden characters your confidence and faith. No! welcome the shame, since
                  it is the background<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6687-00000050"/> ground of glory.
                  Welcome the gross, for the love-crown that glitters in the future!"</p>
               <p>Constance Goldman did not feel as if she had made any sacrifice in pledging her
                  faith to Mordaunt. She believed herself the winner of a noble prize in a heart
                  like his. Never, perhaps, had a young and inexperienced girl a truer estimate of
                  life. A brotherless, sisterless orphan, nature had opened few channels in which
                  her affections could flow. There was nothing in her uncle's character to inspire
                  the love and reverence she longed to bestow on some legitimate object. She had met
                  no one in the circles of wealth and fashion in whom she felt the slightest
                  interest. Of a deeply religious temperament, her heart lifted itself toward God
                  with a fervour and devotion unchecked by any earthly idol. In every son and
                  daughter of sorrow she saw a brother and sister to whom God had appointed her a
                  ministering spirit. So she went about doing good, surrounded by a halo of vestal
                  purity, which made her inapproachable as she was lovely. From the first moment she
                  beheld Mordaunt in the cottage of poor Kate O'Brien, she felt his superiority to
                  his kind; on every succeeding interview she more and more esteemed and honoured
                  him; but it was not till this evening, when, with the quickness of a woman's
                  perception, she read that he was the object of Wiley's malice, and at the same
                  time had a vivid insight into <emph>his</emph> heart, that her own was awakened;
                  and its awakening was like the sun-burst of a smmer's day after a morning of
                  clouds. What if his father's name was a heritage of ignominy? She cared not,
                     since<emph>he</emph> was pure, and of spotless fame. Was he not more noble,
                  more glorious in his own underived excellence?</p>
               <p>When Mordaunt left the grotto, the moon had set, and the silver had faded from the
                  willow's watery boughs. But clear and serene and resplendent shone the <hi
                     rend="i"/>Evening Star above his head.</p>
               <p>On his homeward way he reflected on his destiny, and its whole aspect seemed
                  changed. Even the scaffold had lost its ignominy, and was exalted to the grandeur
                  of the cross. He wondered that he had not thought of it more as the theme of an
                  incarnate Deity—the altar of a god-like sacrifice.</p>
               <p>All the influence of Constance was lost upon her uncle in reference to Mordaunt.
                  He refused to listen to her persuasions, to her earnest exhortations that he would
                  take a noble stand above the prejudices of the vulgar and the passions of the
                  proud. Mordaunt, the son of an executed criminal, should never more be an inmate
                  of his house, an attendant on his person. He wished him no evil, he even forgave
                  him the deception he had practiced, but all intercourse must cease. Poverty could
                  be forgiven, but disgrace, never!</p>
               <p>Constance and Mordaunt both had too lofty a sense of propriety to think of
                  clandestine meetings. She resolved to wait till the time of her majority, and
                  then, being in possession of her fortune, and freed from the legal authority of a
                  guardian, she could openly avow and glory in her choice.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, the malicious tongue of Wiley was not silent. The history of
                  Mordaunt became the<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6687-00000051"/> topic of the day,
                  and wherever he went the eye of curiosity followed him. Many turned away coldly
                  who had formerly smiled, and some who had just begun to smile, frowned, and
                  withdrew their patronage. The artful misrepresentations of Wiley, uttered without
                  any apparent venom or design, were the trail of the serpent, blighting the flowers
                  of confidence and esteem.</p>
               <p>The young physician had, however, one pillar to lean upon, in the firm friendship
                  of Doctor Lewis, firm as the granite, and imperishable as gold. While his proud
                  spirit writhed in secret at the undeserved obloquy darkening his young renown, he
                  thought of the love of Constance, the esteem of Doctor Lewis, and felt himself
                  rich beyond the common hopes of man.</p>
               <p>"Be strong, be patient," said this excellent friend; "be self-reliant and hopeful.
                  It is hardly within the bounds of possibility that your father's memory will ever
                  be cleared of the stain that rests upon it. But the cloud will in time roll away
                  from yourself. It is only what is inherent that is permanent."</p>
               <p>"I have always had a hope so strong as to assume the character of certainty,"
                  replied Mordaunt, "that God would bring about a revelation which would surround my
                  father's memory with the halo of martyrdom. I tremble when I hear of the
                  confessions of dying criminals—tremble with a vague expectation of discovering the
                  actual murderer, in whose stead the innocent and righteous was doomed to
                  suffer."</p>
               <p>"It may be," said the doctor, "but after the lapse of so many years, it would be
                  little short of the miraculous. We must wait for the great day of revealing, when
                  mere circumstantial evidence will be annihilated by the consuming fires of
                  truth.</p>
               <p>One night, as Mordaunt was returning with Doctor Lewis from a professional visit,
                  and passing through a cross street, peopled by poverty and vice, he was arrested
                  by a tumult on the side-walk. Lights were gleaming near the door of a low
                  building, and several figures were rushing out in different directions. One came
                  in violent contact with Mordaunt, at the imminent risk of prostrating him on the
                  pavement.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" he exclaimed. "What is the cause of this violent
                  tumult?"</p>
               <p>"A man is bleeding to death!" cried several voices, clamorously. "Can any one tell
                  us where to find a doctor, a surgeon? He can't live ten minutes, at this
                  rate."</p>
               <p>"Show us the way," said Doctor Lewis. "Here are two doctors at once."</p>
               <p>The next moment, forcing their way through the crowd, they stood in the presence
                  of the bleeding man, and, accustomed as they were to every form of suffering and
                  death, they recoiled with involuntary horror from the spectacle before them. He
                  lay extended on his back, on the bare floor, weltering in his blood. He lay in a
                  crimson pool, and the dark red tide was still gushing from his right arm, like
                  water from a fountain.</p>
               <p>"What is the meaning of this?" said Doctor Lewis,<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000052"/> even his iron nerves vibrating painfully as he
                  gazed upon him.</p>
               <p>"Nothing but a fight," answered a ruffianly-looking bystander. "The man that cut
                  him ran off when he saw him bleed so dreadfully."</p>
               <p>"Nothing but a fight!" repeated Doctor Lewis, sternly; "why he must have cut an
                  artery. "Tis a life-stroke."</p>
               <p>A knife dabbled in blood lay dripping on the floor. Doctor Lewis threw off his
                  coat, seized the knife, and stepping, almost wading into the bloody pool, he
                  stooped down and gashed open the sleeve of the wounded man. To tie up a severed
                  artery is a difficult and dangerous operation, but with a firm yet gentle touch he
                  drew together the issues of life, till the living fibres turned, the valves of the
                  fountain closed, and the victim was saved from immediate death.</p>
               <p>"You are not used to such bloody work," said Doctor Lewis, looking at his own and
                  Mordaunt's ensanguined hands, after they had laid their patient on a bed, in the
                  adjoining room, and administered the customary restoratives. "We might be taken
                  for murderers, indeed," added he, holding out his arms, whose linen covering of
                  dazzling white was reddened with the scarlet dye of murder.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt turned deadly pale. He remembered his father, and the evidence that
                  stained a spotless life.</p>
               <p>"He cannot live," said Doctor Lewis. "Such rills of blood as have flowed from his
                  arteries are enough to exhaust the energies of the strongest life. And why should
                  we wish him to live, only to expend the wonderful muscular strength which God has
                  given him in scenes of violence and strife? I can read in every line of his
                  strongly-marked, disfigured face, a history of blood and crime."</p>
               <p>At length the man opened his eyes, and rolling them round the apartment, they
                  rested on the figures that were seated by the bedside with wonder and terror. He
                  looked upon their grave countenances and bloody arms, and had they been agents of
                  vengeance instead of ministers of mercy, he could not have expressed more wildness
                  of horror in his dim and glassy glance. Mordaunt stood nearest him, his arms
                  folded across his breast, and a dark shade resting upon the sunlight of his eyes.
                  The restless glance of the patient became fixed on his face, and it suddenly
                  flashed, as if from an inward blaze. A hoarse shriek burst from his lips.</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" he cried. "How came you here? I'm not dead yet! By the eternal God,
                  I'll not be tormented before my time! Away, I say! How came that blood on your
                  hands? You didn't do it! Hah!"</p>
               <p>"Come this side, Mordaunt," said Dr. Lewis, in a low voice. "He seems delirious,
                  and there is something about you that agitates him. I want him to be very
                  quiet."</p>
               <p>"Mordaunt, Mordaunt!" groaned the man, "who told you his name?"</p>
               <p>Then pausing, he added, in a whisper—</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6687-00000053"/>
               <p>"Fool! he died upon the scaffold!"</p>
               <p>Mordaunt grasped the Doctor's arm with spasmodic force. The blood rushed in
                  torrents to his brain, to make room for the wild hope that leaped into his
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"Be quiet," said the Doctor, laying his hand on Mordaunt's shoulder, and fixing
                  upon him his commanding eyes. Be quiet. <emph>He may die without
                     confessing.</emph>"</p>
               <p>The last words were audible only to the ear of Mordaunt; but, low as they were,
                  they rung through him like a trumpet's blast. He remained silent, while every
                  fibre of his frame quivered with suppressed emotion.</p>
               <p>Doctor Lewis bent over the wounded man, and addressed him calmly and
                  deliberately.</p>
               <p>"You have but a few hours to live, at the utmost. You are going into the presence
                  of God, a naked, guilty, trembling soul. Your only hope of mercy is in making a
                  full confession of the crimes you have committed. You cannot conceal them.
                     <emph>I</emph> know them. <emph>God</emph> knows them. The assembled universe
                  will know them.</p>
               <p>The dying man uttered the most horrible groans; while, as if under the influence
                  of fascination, he kept his lurid, sunken eyes fixed upon the pale and agitated
                  face of Mordaunt.</p>
               <p>"I can't die," he murmured; "I hav'n't time to repent. <emph>He</emph> had. Every
                  body that dies upon the scaffold goes to Heaven—don't they? A few hours—how many?
                  Tell me, or, by the Almighty God, I'll curse you with my last breath!"</p>
               <p>"You cannot live more than three, perhaps not one," replied the Doctor, with
                  imperturbable composure. "Waste not your breath in idle curses. There was pardon
                  for the dying thief—there may be for you. You cannot bring back the dead; you may
                  justify their memory. For <emph>your</emph> crimes this young man's father
                  perished on the scaffold. Confess it—for, as sure as you die without clearing the
                  innocent, your departing spirit will weave itself a winding-sheet of flames."</p>
               <p>"I will confess," he gasped; "but, God of mercy! it is too late—too late."</p>
               <p>The Doctor moistened the parched lips of the patient; then, having forced him to
                  swallow a reviving mixture, he drew from his pocket paper and pencil, and seated
                  himself with the gravity of a magistrate by the side of the bed. It was not
                  without many interruptions, incoherent ejaculations, groans of despair, and cries
                  for mercy, that the wretched being, who called himself Leftridge, related what we
                  will endeavour to condense in fewer words.</p>
               <p>More than sixteen years previous, Leftridge and Mordaunt (the father of the young
                  physician) met as travellers, in a crowded inn. There was another stranger there,
                  who boasted of the immense quantity of gold in his possession. He looked upon the
                  red wine-cup, and prudence evaporated with its fumes. Leftridge and Mordaunt
                  shared the same room, the same bed. The stranger, with his boasted gold, occupied
                  the next apartment.</p>
               <p>Leftridge could not sleep—a demon was at work<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000054"/> in his heart, hissing temptation. He stole from the
                  side of his sleeping companion, on whose placid face the moonbeams were shining,
                  (strange that man can meditate deeds of guilt, in such a holy light!) Mordaunt's
                  dagger, his travelling weapon of defence, lay gleaming on the table, conspicuous
                  for its gilded sheath. Leftridge drew forth the blade, and touched the edge with
                  his cold fingers. The steel seemed to burn into his flesh, chill as it was. A
                  linen handkerchief lay by its side bearing initials <emph>not his own.</emph> He
                  seized it also, and stole with stealthy steps into the adjoining room. So sure was
                  the blow that but one groan broken on the silence of the night, and that groan
                  echoed not beyond the walls of the death-chamber.</p>
               <p>The murderer filled his pockets with gold and fled. Mordaunt was arrested as the
                  criminal. His own knife, found in the gaping wound, his own handkerchief, bathed
                  in blood, some of the gold, discovered in his pocket, were circumstantial
                  evidences which no counter testimony outweighed. The absence of Leftridge, who was
                  supposed to have left at early dawn, as travellers often did, excited little
                  remark. Mordaunt was a stranger. So great was the public indignation, it came near
                  setting at defiance the majesty of the law, and condemning him without judge or
                  jury. The sequel of his fate is known to the reader from our previous
                  narrative.</p>
               <p>Leftridge wandered from place to place, far from the scene of the two-fold
                  tragedy, spending his ill-gotten gold, and trying to drown in intemperance the
                  unquenchable quenchable fires of remorse. Providence had brought him, at his last
                  hour, face to face with the son of his victim, thus proving its own retributive
                  justice.</p>
               <p>Mordaunt listened to this vindication of his father's memory in breathless
                  emotion, but no vindictive feelings swelled in his bosom. That miserable being,
                  stretched on the very edge of the burning crater of doom, looking into the smoking
                  abyss below, feeling the crumbling earth sinking, giving way beneath—could he look
                  upon him with any emotions save of the deepest compassion? His father had died,
                  sustained by faith and animated by Christian hope. His memory, though stamped with
                  public ignominy, was embalmed by the tears of widowed and filial love. His
                  misfortunes had canonized him. But Leftridge—alas, for the poor wretch! What was
                  left for him but a fearful looking forward to future judgment, and a name steeped
                  in infamy?</p>
               <p>Exhausted by the efforts he had made, he lay panting, gasping, a cold and clammy
                  moisture oozing from his cadaverous skin. And so he died.</p>
               <p>Doctor Lewis took immediate measures to publish to the world the circumstances,
                  which removed the shadow that envy and malice had rolled over Mordaunt's name.
                  They became the topic of the day, and the young physician was exalted into a hero,
                  the hero-son of a martyr-sire. That very night he wrote to his mother—the next he
                  sought the dwelling of Constance.</p>
               <p>"My father's memory is justified," said he, addressing Mr. Goldman; and,
                  notwithstanding the respect<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6687-00000055"/> he wished
                  to manifest to the uncle of Constance, his manner was cold and haughty. "Is the
                  social ban removed from his son?"</p>
               <p>"I regret exceedingly, Doctor Mordaunt," answered Mr. Goldman, in much
                  embarrassment, "that circumstances have compelled me to put an unnatural restraint
                  upon my feelings. For myself, I could rise above the prejudices of the world; but
                  as the guardian of a young lady of rank and fortune, I have been compelled to be
                  circumspect. We live in a cold and censorious world."</p>
               <p>"I am fully aware of that truth, sir," answered Mordaunt, with a slight dash of
                  bitterness in his tone; but the entrance of Constance, now the <hi rend="i"
                  />Morning Star of his destiny, dispersed the lingering clouds of haughtiness from
                  his brow, and he remembered nothing but that <emph>her</emph> faith and trust had
                  been the same, <q>
                     <l>"Through joy and through sorrow, through glory and shame."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Wiley had the audacity to call at his office and offer his congratulations. He
                  extended his hand with the assurance of a welcome guest. Mordaunt folded his arms
                  and drew back with stately reserve.</p>
               <p>"You can enter my doors and sit down in my office," said he, with a glance that
                  brought the hot blood to Wiley's usually cold cheek, "for they are not a part of
                  myself; but my hand is my <emph>own,</emph> and never shall be voluntarily given
                  to a man whose heart I know to be destitute of every warm and generous feeling.
                  That I bear no vindictive remembrance of the past, let this action speak."</p>
               <p>Taking from his pocket-book a soiled and worn-looking paper, he put it in the hand
                  of Wiley.</p>
               <p>"This paper," he added, "relates to yourself. The Stephen Wiley there referred to
                  as the leader of a notorious band of counterfeiters must be your own father. There
                  are collateral proofs which I can gather up, if you will it, and place in strong
                  array before your eyes. This paper was found upon the person of Leftridge, the
                  murderer, himself one of that lawless band. Doctor Lewis is the only man beside
                  myself acquainted with this disagreeable fact. <emph>He</emph> will never publish
                  it to the world, and I should look upon myself with loathing and scorn, if I could
                  imitate the malice from whose evils I have just been liberated, and seek to cover
                  you with a father's shame. Now your secret is safe. Tear the paper into a thousand
                  pieces, if you will, and let the winds of heaven disperse the relics."</p>
               <p>Wiley crushed the paper as if with iron fingers. His lips turned of ashy paleness,
                  while the veins in his forehead swelled and stood out like purple cords. He tried
                  to speak and falsify the evidence of truth, but the words adhered to his palsied
                  tongue. The astounding revelation brought about by such a strange coincidence of
                  circumstances seemed so much like the retributive justice of heaven, he was struck
                  dumb with terror, and his coward eye quailed before the flashing gaze of
                  Mordaunt.</p>
               <p>"I again repeat," said the latter, "that your secret is safe. <emph>You know it
                     is.</emph> You know me to be incapable of a mean revenge. And I will add, that
                  if you<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6687-00000056"/> profit by this bitter lesson, if
                  you ever awaken to the beauty of truth and the value of friendship, if you should
                  offer your hand with an honest heart in it, then mine shall close upon it with
                  equal readiness and cordiality."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>are generous,</emph>" exclaimed Wiley, in a hoarse unnatural voice,
                  "but I cannot talk now. Farewell, Mordaunt. You will never see me again, unless I
                  can accept your offered conditions. I shall leave the city immediately. My
                  character is in your hands. Do what you will with it, I shall never complain."</p>
               <p>They parted, and years passed before they met again. When they did meet, Wiley
                  extended his hand, and Mordaunt did not reject it. Magnanimity had triumphed over
                  malice. Wiley never became a warm-hearted or amiable man, for he wanted the genial
                  elements to constitute such a character, but he did endeavour to be a just and
                  honest one, and he had the candour to acknowledge that it was owing to the
                  influence of Mordaunt. He had been a cold skeptic in the belief of the existence
                  of moral excellence; but there was a living reality, a simple majesty and truth in
                  Mordaunt's virtues, to which his spirit bowed in late but sincere
                  acknowledgment.</p>
               <p>And once again Mordaunt sat with Constance in the "Fairy's Grotto." The fountain
                  threw up its silvery spray into the moonlight, falling with the same lulling music
                  in the marble reservoir. The beautiful daughter of Danaus still held her empty
                  vase beneath the waters, the lovely Bacchante caught the same resplendent crown
                  upon her leafy brow, and the graceful Flora twined her fadeless garlands in the
                  shade.</p>
               <p>Constance, fair and pure as these marble graces reposing in the moonlight, and ten
                  thousand times as lovely, sat beside her husband, her eyes raised to the
                  night-arch bending radiantly above them.</p>
               <p>"Do you see that solitary star?" said Mordaunt, taking her hand in his, and
                  raising it in his toward one whose rays were almost lost in the full glory of the
                  moon. "The first night I ever met you, I fixed my gaze upon that planet, and
                  thoughts, holy and inspiring, rushed into my soul. The dread of poverty, the fear
                  of shame, melted away in its divine effulgence. I saw you in the cottage. From
                  that moment you became the <hi rend="i"/>Evening Star of my destiny, shining on
                  with steadily increasing brightness unto the perfect day."</p>

               <head>The two Sisters and the two Uncles.</head>
               <p>MISS PHILLIS MANNERS was the maiden sister of Mr. Manners, and the female guardian
                  and governess of his two motherless daughters, Lelia and Elmira. One evening, Miss
                  Manners entered the apartment of her neices, with a decided air of vexation, and
                  even anger.</p>
               <p>"How provoking!" she exclaimed; "how unfortunate! The most mortifying circumstance
                  in the world!"</p>
               <p>"What is it, Aunt Phillis?" asked Lelia, sympathizingly.</p>
               <p>"Aunt Phillis again!" repeated the lady. "Will you never learn to call me Cousin
                  Phillis? I have told you a hundred times I disliked that formal, old-fashioned
                  title."</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, dear aunt. Well, I cannot help addressing you so—I have always called
                  things by their right names, and as you are my aunt, and not my cousin, I can't
                  see the sin of giving you the title nature designates. You know I haven't been
                  with you long—I shall become accustomed by-and-by to your peculiarities, and
                  endeavour to conform to them. Pray, tell us what is so provoking?"</p>
               <p>"Your father has just received a letter from your Uncle Clements. He is coming
                  here to-morrow, the very day I expect your Uncle Banks. Was ever any thing so
                  provoking?"</p>
               <p>"Provoking, indeed!" cried Elmira, reflecting, as in a mirror, the mortified
                  expression of her aunt's face.</p>
               <p>"Dear Uncle Clements!" exclaimed Lelia, clasping her hands joyfully together. "I
                  am so glad he is coming—Aunt Lydia told me so much of his goodness, piety, and
                  talents, my heart yearns towards him. Our mother, too, loved him very dearly."</p>
               <p>Miss Manners cast a withering look on the glowing countenance of Lelia.</p>
               <p>"You forget his poverty and the low society he must keep, in comparison with his
                  brother. Mr. Banks is come into possession of a splendid fortune, and will visit
                  us in a style suited to his rank. There will be a succession of parties and
                  entertainments while he is here. We shall all derive great consequence from his
                  wealth—but the poverty of your Uncle Clements will weigh as much against us in the
                  opposite scale. I never was so vexed in my life."</p>
               <p>"I did not know that poverty, produced by misfortune, was a crime and a
                  degradation, before," said Lelia, warmly. "For my part, I feel inclined to pay him
                  a thousand times more respect, in his present reduced circumstances, than if he
                  were rolling in affluence."</p>
               <p>"Whatever your inclinations may be," said Miss Manners, with dignity, "you will be
                  careful not to offend your Uncle Banks, by showing a preference to Mr. Clements.
                  He is only half brother to your<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6687-00000058"/> mother,
                  and I don't see the necessity of calling him uncle at all."</p>
               <p>"Must we call him cousin, too?" asked Lelia, laughing.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you will honour his precious son Charles, who is to accompany him, with
                  that title," replied her aunt. "But I warn you against familiarity with him. Your
                  Uncle Banks has a son, with whom you may be proud to claim kindred, and though he
                  is your cousin, it does not prevent the possibility of a nearer connection. It
                  would be well to have the property kept in the family. Young ladies, a great deal
                  may depend upon this visit of your uncle's. The stay of the last shall be very
                  short, if it depends on <emph>my</emph> influence."</p>
               <p>"Surely, aunt—cousin—you will not treat him with incivility?" said Lelia—looking
                  reproachfully at her silent sister.</p>
               <p>"I shall not be dictated to in my course of conduct, Miss Lelia: but whatever it
                  is, I shall expect you will imitate it. Your sister, I am confident, will do so,
                  without any exercise of authority on my part. Your father leaves all household
                  regulations to me, and I shall allow no interference in my arrangements."</p>
               <p>She left the room, as she spoke, with a raised head, or rather a raised turban,
                  for her head, unusually small, was enveloped in such voluminous folds of muslin
                  and lace, it required some discrimination to notice the face, surmounted by such a
                  tremendous turret. The sisters were left alone, and looked into each other's faces
                  for a moment, without speaking— Lelia's cheeks burned with an unusual colour, and
                  her eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>
               <p>"Thank Heaven!" cried she, "that I said nothing really disrespectful to Aunt
                  Phillis—but from you, Elmira, I cannot withhold the expression of indignant
                  feeling. Speak to me, sister, and say you scorn such sordid views, and know how to
                  appreciate virtue itself. Say that you will unite with me in paying both our
                  uncles the respect and affection that is due to them—that you will make no
                  distinction in favour of wealth or circumstances. Think if our dear mother were
                  alive, what she would wish us to do, and you will never wound the feelings of one
                  who was so dear to her."</p>
               <p>"You are the strangest girl I ever saw in my life, Lelia," said Elmira, coldly;
                  "you make as much fuss about this old uncle as if he were made of gold; I don't
                  know what we shall do with him—for Uncle Banks must have the handsomest chamber,
                  and we must keep the next handsomest for company. Then there is Cousin Phillis'
                  room and ours. The other chambers are very decent, but they have no fire-places.
                  He will be obliged to be satisfied with one of them. Cousin Phillis never will
                  allow a bed to be put in one of the lower apartments."</p>
               <p>"Has our father no authority in his own household, that every thing must be
                  referred to <emph>Cousin</emph> Phillis, as you are pleased to call her?" asked
                  Lelia, trying to speak calmly. "If I find Uncle Clements' comfort so entirely
                  diregarded, I shall speak to <emph>him,</emph> and see that he is properly
                  attended to."</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6687-00000059"/>
               <p>"Father would as soon cut off his right hand, as contradict any of Cousin Phillis'
                  orders, I assure you," answered Elmira. "You are the only person who ever dared to
                  do it yet, and you will be very sorry for it. She said before you came home, she
                  knew Aunt Lydia had spoiled you, and it is true enough. You are exactly like her,
                  in thought, word, and action."</p>
               <p>"Oh! that I were indeed like her," exclaimed Lelia, "for a gentler purer, holier
                  being, never lived. All my virtues are hers, all my faults my own. Let me never
                  hear <emph>her</emph> reproached for follies or sins which are the legitimate
                  offspring of my own heart."</p>
               <p>Unable to repress the tears which this unkind allusion to a relative so tenderly
                  beloved, and so recently lost, excited, Lelia left the room, feeling more keenly
                  than she had ever done before, that between her sister and herself there was not
                  one feeling or principle in common. All that is necessary to state of the previous
                  history of these two young sisters, may be explained in a few words. Deprived in
                  childhood of their mother, they were separated immediately after her death, and
                  placed under influences as opposite as pole to pole. Aunt Lydia, a maiden sister
                  of Mrs. Manners, received the orphan Lelia from her dying mother, as her own, and
                  as such she educated and cherished her, till, her death making her a second time
                  an orphan, she returned to her father's house. Elmira remained at home, under the
                  care of Miss Phillis Manners, who assumed the charge of her brother's household
                  hold, with an authority as absolute and undisputed as the laws of the Medes and
                  Persians.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manners was one of those good-natured men, who always avoid trouble and
                  contention, and who have not moral courage enough to follow up the principles they
                  profess to admire. He believed his sister one of the best managers in the world,
                  probably from the bustle attending all her movements, and thought himself very
                  fortunate in having so careful and discreet a guardian for his daughter. He
                  regretted that Lelia did not enjoy equal advantages, for Aunt Lydia was so quiet
                  and unpresuming, and made so little parade of her own good deeds, and he was so
                  accustomed to the egotism and display of his sister, he imagined that Aunt Lydia
                  was one of those passive characters who exercised but little influence in her own
                  household. Had he reflected a little on the great laws of nature, he would have
                  remembered that the most powerful influences are silent and often unseen. The rays
                  that illumine the immensity of the universe, as silently as brightly execute their
                  glorious mission. The dews that refresh the sultriness of nature, steal silent and
                  unseen from their secret dwelling-place, and "teach mankind unostentatious
                  charity." But Mr. Manners never reasoned from analogy, indeed, he seldom reasoned
                  at all, and it is not strange that the unobtrusive virtues of Aunt Lydia escaped
                  his worldly observation. True, when Lelia returned, he would have thought her very
                  graceful, lovely, and amiable, had not his acute-minded sister discovered so many
                  blemishes in her,<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6687-00000060"/> and such superior
                  excellences in Elmira. He concluded, as usual, that she was a better judge than
                  himself, and her opinion was considered infallible.</p>
               <p>Miss Phillis Manners, alias Aunt Phillis, alias Cousin Phillis, would have been in
                  the full sweep of her glory, on the day of Mr. Banks' arrival, had not the
                  expectation of Mr. Clements' visit cast its dark shadow before. It is not to be
                  supposed, that all her anxiety was disinterested, or that it was for the
                  aggrandizement of her nieces alone, she was hoping, and toiling, and planning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Banks was a widower, and as she had passed her vernal morn and summer noon in
                  maiden singleness of heart, she was resolved that the quietude of her autumnal eve
                  should be spent in the shadow of the myrtle bower. Notwithstanding her sincerity
                  to her brother, and the truths her oft-consulted mirror breathed of her withering
                  beauty, she fancied every one else must be labouring under an optical illusion,
                  and imagined herself still in the spring-time of youth. It was a great source of
                  vexation that she was compelled to own her once dark, but now bleaching locks,
                  thus detracting from the juvenility of her appearance, but she consoled herself
                  with the idea that a turban was a most becoming and oriental style of head-dress,
                  admirably in keeping with the erectness and dignity of her figure. This day she
                  appeared dressed with elaborate elegance—on her white turban she wore a single
                  artificial white rose, placed over her left ear, partly twisted in her long,
                  flowing curls; pearl ornaments on her neck, and a robe of delicate, lilac-coloured
                  silk, fitted closely to her really fine form. No wrinkle was ever allowed to mar
                  the outline of her dress, and could she have exercised as arbitrary a dominion
                  over her face, it would have been as smooth as Parian marble. She had been
                  practising a kind of eager smile, with which to welcome the East India nabob, as
                  she had great faith in first impressions. Elmira, who implicitly followed her
                  aunt's directions, was also much adorned, but Lelia made no alteration in the
                  mourning garb she wore in memory of Aunt Lydia. Miss Phillis told her that she had
                  never looked so shocking in her life, that her eyes were as heavy as lead, and her
                  complexion as pale as ashes. She did, indeed, look pale, for she was agitated in
                  the prospect of meeting so many kindred she had never seen, and in the dread that
                  their visit would be a source of domestic trial to her, determined as she was not
                  to yield her principles of right to the tyranny of her aunt, or the ridicule of
                  her sister.</p>
               <p>"He's come—Uncle Banks is come!" exclaimed Elmira, who had been watching at the
                  window, alternately with her aunt, at least two hours. In a moment the whole
                  household was in a bustle—a splendid carriage stopped at the door—a footman let
                  down the steps, with as much ceremony as if a king were about to descend. Aunt
                  Phillis stood on the threshold, smiling, and courtseying, and trying to blush, as
                  a large, red-faced gentleman, wrapped in a blue cloak, slowly alighted, and walked
                  up the flag-stones, breathing audibly at every step. A tall, straight,
                     sandy-haired<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6687-00000061"/> haired young man
                  followed him, in whom Elmira immediately discovered a striking resemblance to the
                  picture of Prince Albert, and who was dressed in as princely a style as our
                  republican costume will allow.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, a thousand times welcome," exclaimed Aunt Phillis, sinking lower and
                  lower, while she extended both her hands to the short-breathed gentleman, who came
                  panting towards her.</p>
               <p>"Thank you—how d'ye do? Hope to see you very well, ma'am," said Mr. Banks, as soon
                  as he recovered his breath sufficiently, shaking her hand up and down, something
                  in the style of a pump-handle. "Ha—this is my niece, is it? Blooming as a peach,
                  glad to see your uncle, hey?" catching Elmira under the chin, and giving her a
                  salute that echoed to the farthest corner of the ante-room. "This is my son
                  Joe—quite a man grown—just like his father—chip of the old block—ha!"</p>
               <p>Lelia, who had shrunk back in the first rush of welcome, now tremblingly
                  approached her uncle. He was the first of her mother's relatives she had ever
                  seen, except Aunt Lydia, and her heart throbbed with undefinable emotion.</p>
               <p>"What little baggage is this?" cried Mr. Banks, giving her at the same time a
                  smothering embrace. "Just like her mother. This must be Liddy's child.</p>
               <p>Lelia saw a tear trembling in the corner of his clear, gray eye, and she forgot
                  for a moment the roughness of his manners, and the singularity of his dialect.</p>
               <p>As soon as they entered the sitting-room, Mr. Banks sank down into a chair, as if
                  quite exhausted, calling for a cushion for his feet in no very gentle tone. Miss
                  Phillis sprang to the sofa, and catching up the cushions, placed them under his
                  feet like a lapwing.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, ma'am. Excuse me—troubled with the gout—dreadful twinges—great
                  invalid—poor appetite—be better by-and-by."</p>
               <p>Lelia thought it strange to hear a man, with such round, ruddy cheeks and robust
                  frame, complaining of ill-health, and she could not help smiling to hear her aunt
                  declaring that he did indeed look like an invalid, and she feared the journey had
                  been too much for him.</p>
               <p>Cousin Joe seemed as bashful and reserved as his father was free and easy, and
                  seating himself at a respectful distance, communed with his own thoughts. Placed
                  in such a luxurious attitude, Mr. Banks gradually recovered the composure of his
                  muscles, which had been dreadfully distorted, nodded and smiled at his nieces, and
                  calling Lelia to him, made her sit down on his knee, and patted her on the head
                  like a little child.</p>
               <p>"Good girl," said he; "Liddy told me all about you. Don't be afraid of your uncle.
                  Rough outside—nothing but the bark—smooth kernel inside."</p>
               <p>Lelia smiled, and began to think she should like her uncle, in spite of his rough
                  outside, but Aunt Phillis was not at all pleased that Lelia should be placed in
                  the foreground of the picture, and drawing Elmira towards him, she said, in a
                  playful tone, "you<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6687-00000062"/> must not slight
                     <emph>my</emph> pet—you don't know how anxiously she has watched your coming.
                  She has been almost crazy to see you."</p>
               <p>"Fine girl, too, cried Mr. Banks, pinching her cheeks; "good healthy colour. Got
                  any sweethearts, hey? Must look sharp—see if they've got the chink. Can't live
                  without it—oils the springs—keeps them agoing—hey?"</p>
               <p>Here he put both hands in his pockets, and shook with inward laughter for several
                  moments; then opening his mouth, the sound began to roll out in echoing peals,
                  which Aunt Phillis thought proper to echo again, more faintly, and Elmira fainter
                  still. Lelia alone looked grave, and her gravity seemed to increase Mr. Banks'
                  mirth, who continued to laugh till he was obliged to hold his own sides.</p>
               <p>"Can't help it," said he; "never could stop—does one good—helps digestion—troubled
                  with the dyspepsia—obliged to diet."</p>
               <p>Lelia thought when she saw her uncle at the supper-table, complaining of the
                  poorness of his appetite, yet eating heartily all the time, requiring a dozen
                  things which were not on the table; keeping the servants running in every
                  direction, and Aunt Phillis' eyes flying from dish to dish in ludicrous
                  perplexity, trying to anticipate his wishes, that he was the strangest invalid she
                  ever saw. He was very particular about eggs, an indispensable ingredient of all
                  his meals. At first they were too hard, then too soft—again, there was a crack in
                  the shell, through which some drops of water had penetrated. At length he had the
                  boiling ing water brought to the table, and taking out his watch, cooked them to
                  his apparent satisfaction. Poor Aunt Phillis sat, without eating a mouthful,
                  endeavouring to look pleased, though ready to burst with vexation, for she prided
                  herself upon the superiority of her cookery, and on this occasion no luxury had
                  been spared, which could tempt the most fastidious taste. She had, however, one
                  source of consolation. The evening was already advanced, and Mr. Clements had not
                  yet made his appearance. She could not help hoping some fortunate accident had
                  detained him, and that he would not be present to obstruct the incense she was
                  preparing for the golden calf she had set up as her idol. Night came on, and Mr.
                  Banks, pleading excessive fatigue and gouty pains, was ushered up stairs into the
                  most sumptuous apartment the house afforded, and Aunt Phillis drew a deep
                  inspiration, as if relieved from the visitation of a nightmare.</p>
               <p>"Very pleasant gentleman your uncle is," said she, looking at Elmira. "Rather
                  particular in his ways—but that is owing to his ill-health. So perfetly original.
                  How do you like your Cousin Joseph? I think him one of the most perfect gentlemen
                  I have ever seen."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt we shall find him very interesting," replied Elmira; "but he does
                  not seem inclined to talk much. He seems very distant, for a cousin."</p>
               <p>"You cannot expect so much familiarity from one of his great expectations, as from
                  an inferior person," said Aunt Phillis. "He cannot but feel his own
                  consequence."</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6687-00000063"/>
               <p>Lelia smiled, and was about to speak, when Aunt Phillis interrupted her.</p>
               <p>"I wish you would break yourself of that saucy habit of smiling at my remarks,
                  Miss Lelia; I assure you, I think it very impertinent."</p>
               <p>"Dear aunt——"</p>
               <p>"Dear aunt again—you called me dear aunt at the supper-table three times, as if in
                  defiance of my prohibition, and on purpose to draw the attention of Mr.
                  Banks."</p>
               <p>The lumbering sound of wheels approaching the door, arrested the attention of all,
                  and the clinking sound of the falling steps, convinced them that some one was
                  descending.</p>
               <p>"It must be Uncle Clements," exclaimed Lelia, eagerly opening the door, while Aunt
                  Phillis and Elmira exchanged glances of undisguised chagrin.</p>
               <p>"You need not ring the bell," said Aunt Phillis, seeing the motion of Lelia's
                  hand; "the stage-driver will attend to him."</p>
               <p>But the mandate came too late, for a merry peal rang through the hall, as Mr.
                  Clements and his son entered the house. The lamps that lighted the passage most
                  brilliantly in honour of Mr. Banks, threw their full blaze on their advancing
                  figures, and Lelia, on whom the whole burden of welcome seemed to rest, felt a
                  glow of delight diffused over her whole heart, in tracing, even then, in the mild
                  lineaments of her uncle's face, a resemblance to her beloved Aunt Lydia.</p>
               <p>"Oh, what a contrast!" thought she, as she looked at her Cousin Charles. The next
                  moment she was in her uncle's affectionate embrace—as affectionate, but far less
                  energetic, than Mr. Banks' <emph>high-pressure</emph> greeting. Miss Phillis
                  Manners received them with stately civility, which Elmira tried to imitate, though
                  she could not help thinking that if her Cousin Joe did resemble Prince Albert, her
                  Cousin Charles was vastly handsomer, and more engaging in his appearance. He was
                  dressed in a complete suit of black, which corresponded well with his dark hair
                  and eyes, and so was the father, but the coat of the latter was rusty and
                  threadbare, and his whole apparel that of a decayed gentleman.</p>
               <p>"And these are my two nieces," said Mr. Clements, looking from one to the other,
                  with moistened eyes, "my sister's children! Is it possible? How difficult it is to
                  realize your blooming womanhood! Charles, you have often heard me speak of their
                  mother; here," turning to Lelia, "is her living picture."</p>
               <p>A violent ringing of the bell produced a sudden silence. Miss Phillis started up
                  in alarm, when Mr. Banks' footman opened the door, with a half comic, half tragic
                  countenance.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" cried Miss Phillis. "Is Mr. Banks ill? Has any thing
                  happened?"</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am!" he replied; "but he says the sheets are damp, and will give him the
                  rheumatiz. He wants them changed, if you please, directly. He's walking about as
                  fast as he can for exercise, till it's done, to keep from catching cold."</p>
               <p>"Tell him the sheets have been doubly and trebly<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000064"/> aired," answered she, in a raised tone. "I am
                  remarkably careful about such things. There is no possible danger of taking
                  cold."</p>
               <p>"It won't do any good to tell him so, ma'am," said the man, grinning. "When he
                  once gets a notion into his head, you might as well try to move the globe as to
                  get it out of him. He won't sleep to-night, unless you humour him about the
                  sheets."</p>
               <p>Miss Phillis left the room with great alacrity; but the manner in which she closed
                  the doors, showed she was not altogether pleased with Mr. Banks' original
                  ways.</p>
               <p>Lelia began to feel very uneasy about her uncle's accommodations for the night.
                  She saw he looked pale and fatigued, and seemed oppressed with a dry cough.
                  Charles watched his father's countenance with deep anxiety, and asked him if he
                  would not retire, adding, that he was still too much of an invalid not to practice
                  some self-indulgence.</p>
               <p>Lelia had not exchanged a word with her aunt upon the subject; she had put off the
                  evil hour as long as possible. It could not be deferred any longer, and hearing
                  her footsteps descending the stairs, she rose with precipitation and left the
                  room, telling her uncle that she would have a room immediately prepared for his
                  reception. She met her aunt on the stairs, whose clouded brow would have terrified
                  her from any purpose, in which her own gratification was concerned.</p>
               <p>"Cousin Phillis," said she, trying to propitiate her, by giving her the name she
                  loved, "Uncle Clements is very much fatigued, and wishes to retire. I suppose he
                  will occupy the blue chamber."</p>
               <p>"The blue chamber!" repeated Aunt Phillis. "And what right have you to think that
                     <emph>he</emph> will occupy the blue chamber? The very best chamber in the
                  house."</p>
               <p>"Because," said Lelia, gathering courage as she proceeded, "because there is no
                  other unoccupied sleeping-room, sufficiently comfortable at this season of the
                  year. There is the one which has been appropriated to Uncle Banks, certainly as
                  handsome as the blue chamber. Then there is father's, and yours, and sister's, and
                  my own—all warm and pleasant. The others have no fire-places, and you would not
                  surely assign them to an invalid, such cold nights as these."</p>
               <p>Aunt Phillis gave Lelia a look which had often made others quail, but she returned
                  it with an undaunted glance.</p>
               <p>"Silence is assent," cried she, springing down the steps. "I'll tell Peggy to
                  kindle a fire in the blue chamber."</p>
               <p>"If you do," said Aunt Phillis, shaking her forefinger at her from the platform on
                  which she stood, with the gesture of a Pythoness; "if you do, you'll repent it in
                  dust and ashes."</p>
               <p>Lelia paused. Her spirit was roused. She felt that she was the eldest daughter of
                  her father's house, and had a right to command, when her father's reputation for
                  justice and hospitality was thus endangered. She feared, however, a scene of
                  disgraceful violence, which might reach her uncle's ears, and though almost
                  despising herself for the act, she<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6687-00000065"/>
                  condescended to plead and reason. She went back to where her aunt stood.</p>
               <p>"You do not reflect, aunt, what a strange appearance it will have—such a marked
                  distinction between two brothers. The very servants will talk of it, and report it
                  to our neighbours. We shall be condemned by all as mercenary and unkind."</p>
               <p>"I don't care if we are, miss," retorted she, "it's none of their business, nor
                  yours either. As to the chamber I've allotted to him, I've no doubt it's a palace
                  to what he ever slept in before. What's he, I should like to know—a poor,
                  penny-stripped fellow, a hanger-on of rich relations, a codger worth nothing but
                  the coat on his back, and that almost out at the elbows, that he should be served
                  so daintily? He had no business to stick his nose where he's not wanted. If he
                  don't like his accommodations, he may go away, and the sooner the better."</p>
               <p>Aunt Phillis paused to take breath, as a person drinking a glass of soda sometimes
                  stops from the rapidity of the effervescence—but the angry fluid continued to flow
                  from her eyes.</p>
               <p>"I will appeal to my father," said Lelia, "and, thank heaven! here he comes."</p>
               <p>Mr. Manners at this moment opened the street door, and looked, with a little
                  trepidation, on the theatrical figure of his sister, standing erect upon the
                  stairs, the rose over her left ear trembling and tossing as if instinct with life,
                  a symptom with which he was very familiar; for, like certain animals, when excited
                  by passion, she had a vibratory motion of the ears. Lelia ran to her father, and
                  putting her arm in his, drew him towards her sister, in spite of his evident
                  reluctance.</p>
               <p>"Dear father," said she, "Aunt Phillis is not willing that Uncle Clements should
                  have a comfortable room to sleep in. Uncle Banks has the green chamber, with a
                  blazing fire, and poor Uncle Clements is to be put in the north-case corner of the
                  house, without a particle of fire, or even curtains to his bed. Is it right,
                  father? is it kind?</p>
               <p>Poor Mr. Manners was so unaccustomed to exercise any decision of his own in
                  household affairs, and feared so much the keen edge of his sister's tongue—he
                  found himself in a most unpleasant dilemma. He hated scenes—he wanted to get along
                  with as little trouble as possible.</p>
               <p>"Brother," said Miss Phillis, "we've lived very peaceably, till this girl came
                  back to give me her impertinence from morning till night. I will not bear it—if
                  she's to the mistress, I'll quit the house. I leave you to decide."</p>
               <p>She uttered this in a low tone, and a kind of bitter smile, a thousand times more
                  fearful than her frown.</p>
               <p>"'Psho! Phillis—don't talk in that way," stammered Mr. Manners, "she don't mean
                  any disrespect to you; there's some misunderstanding, I dare say. Lelia, your aunt
                  will see that everything is right; I always leave such matters to her, and it is
                  proper that you should do so—there's plenty of room in the house—no
                  difficulty——"</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6687-00000066"/>
               <p>Ashamed of his want of moral resolution, he hastened into the parlour, whither his
                  sister followed him, with a majestical step, leaving Lelia alone on the stairs. So
                  completely overwhelmed was she with disappointment, shame, and, it must be
                  confessed, with indignation too, that she sat down, and leaning against the
                  banister, covered her face and wept like a child.</p>
               <p>"What will they think of us?" said she to herself, "what will they think of me? It
                  was I who told them I would order a room to be prepared. They will think it is my
                  selection, and despise me in their hearts—and there is Uncle Banks, with his great
                  ruddy face and vigorous frame, in his sumptuous apartment, issuing his orders with
                  the authority of the Grand Lama. Oh! the omnipotence of gold!"</p>
               <p>Absorbed in these bitter reflections, and hearing only the sound of her own
                  stifled sobs, she was not aware of approaching footsteps till they were close
                  beside her, when, looking up, she beheld her uncle ascending the stairs, leaning
                  on the arm of his son, and preceded by Peggy, the chambermaid, who looked ashamed
                  of the office she was performing. Her uncle paused as he passed, and laying his
                  hand tenderly on her head, exclaimed, "God bless thee, my child."</p>
               <p>Her Cousin Charles, too, caught her hand, and pressing it warmly, said, "Good
                  night, my dear cousin."</p>
               <p>The words were nothing in themselves, but there was something in the tone of his
                  voice, and in the glance of his dark, penetrating eye, that seemed to say, "Thou
                  hast no part or lot in this matter."</p>
               <p>Could they have overheard the conversation respecting them? It was possible that
                  the door might have been left ajar, and Aunt Phillis' voice was shrill in her
                  anger. She knew not that she ought to derive comfort from this supposition, since
                  it exposed her aunt and her father to such opprobrium, but she could not help
                  encouraging the idea, and retired to her chamber, soothed by the remembrance of
                  her uncle's blessing, and her cousin's affectionate "good night."</p>
               <p>She was permitted to remain alone some time, for Elmira was closeted with her
                  aunt, probably listening to her wrathful account of the events of the evening.
                  Lelia rejoiced at this circumstance, as she could in stillness and solitude
                  commune with her own excited spirit. Upon reflection, she was not pleased with her
                  own conduct. Principle had guided her actions, but passion had mingled its base
                  alloy with the pure gold of her upright intentions. She trembled to think of the
                  unchristian feelings in which she had indulged.</p>
               <p>"God forgive me!" cried she, clasping her hands over the Bible, which she had
                  opened and commenced to read, preparatory to her nightly rest, "for the evil
                  thoughts of this night. I have hated my aunt, despised my father and sister, and
                  triumphed in my own conscious superiority. Perhaps if I had displayed more
                  meekness, her stubborn will might have yielded. Uncle Clements looks like a
                  Christian. He has the evangelical countenance of Aunt Lydia, her mild<pb
                     n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6687-00000067"/> benignant smile. No bitterness dwells
                  in his heart. I will try to banish it from mine."</p>
               <p>When Elmira entered the apartment, accompanied by her aunt, who always remained a
                  while in her nieces' room, before retiring to her own, Lelia's head rested
                  placidly on the pillow, and her eyelids were gently closed. Aunt Phillis held the
                  candle over her to see if she were really asleep. Her cheeks were flushed, and the
                  moisture yet glittered on her eyelids; but her soft, regular breathing, indicated
                  the peacefulness and depth of her slumbers. Young eyelids, steeped in tears, close
                  heavily in sleep, and Lelia's self-communion and self-humiliation had diffused a
                  quietude over her troubled soul, and hushed her passions into rest. It would seem
                  impossible for any one to look upon her, in her innocence and purity, and cherish
                  vindictive feelings towards her; but the very contemplation of this innocence and
                  sweetness only added fuel to Aunt Phillis' ire.</p>
               <p>"Impudent little minx," muttered she, "I wonder how she dares to sleep!"</p>
               <p>It is hardly uncharitable to suppose that she would not have been sorry if a stray
                  spark had fallen on her muslin night-cap, and scorched the bright locks that
                  wandered over her brow. Aunt Phillis sat down the candle, seated herself in front
                  of the fire, and placing her feet on the fender, fell into a reverie.</p>
               <p>"It is very cold," said she, at length, drawing a large shawl over her shoulders.
                  "I am glad I told them to keep up a fire in Mr. Banks' room to-night. If he should
                  get the gout in his stomach, he might die, and I wouldn't have him die for a
                  thousand dollars, before——"</p>
               <p>She stopped, for she found she was thinking aloud, and became conscious Elmira was
                  listening, for she laughed aloud.</p>
               <p>"I'm sure there does not seem much danger of his dying, with his red face and
                  stout body," said she. "Uncle Clements looks like a shadow to him. But really,
                  Cousin Charles is very handsome, and seems very much like a gentleman, too. He is
                  not dressed meanly, either—and looks proud enough, though he is so poor. Don't you
                  think he is handsome, aunt?"</p>
               <p>"I don't think any thing about him," replied she sharply; "I don't want to hear
                  his name, or his father's either. I wish they were both in Nova Zembla."</p>
               <p>"They might as well be in Nova Zembla, as the place they are in now," thought
                  Elmira, "for all the comfort they get in it."</p>
               <p>But she was prudent enough not to express this idea. She began to take off the
                  ornaments from her hair, and while engaged in this operation before the mirror, a
                  sudden thought seemed to strike her.</p>
               <p>"Was mother very handsome, Cousin Phillis?" asked she, twisting a string of pearls
                  round her fingers, again and again.</p>
               <p>"What a question!" repeated Aunt Phillis. "She looked well enough, I
                  believe—nothing extraordinary. Why?"</p>
               <p>"Because every one says Lelia is the image of her, as if it were the greatest
                  compliment in the world. I<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6687-00000068"/> wonder who
                     <emph>I</emph> am like—for I am not in the least like Lelia."</p>
               <p>"You are said to resemble <emph>me,</emph>" said Aunt Phillis, drawing up her neck
                  with a self-complacent air; "I heard Mr. Banks say there was a striking
                  resemblance."</p>
               <p>"Now, aunt, you know he never said any such a thing," replied Elmira, deeply
                  mortified; "he said there was a family resemblance, and that was all. How can you
                  say, aunt, I look like you? There isn't a feature in our faces alike—and then you
                  look so much <emph>older!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Elmira forgot her fear of her aunt, in her wounded vanity, or she would never have
                  dared to breathe the hint that she thought her older than herself, or less
                  handsome.</p>
               <p>"Really, Miss," cried Aunt Phillis, giving the fender a push against the
                  fire-place as she spoke; it's a great insult to be said to resemble
                     <emph>me,</emph> is it? I am not so old or so ugly, as to be ashamed to look in
                  the glass with any one. Really, these bread and butter Misses think any body, who
                  has arrived at years of discretion, is as old as Methuselah, and ugly too,
                  forsooth. Well, the world has got to a strange pass, when little girls not only
                  think themselves wiser and better, but younger and handsomer than any body
                  else."</p>
               <p>She took up the candle with a jerk, gave the fender another push, and walked out
                  of the apartment in a highly <emph>acidified</emph> state of feeling.</p>
               <p>"Look like her, indeed!" said Elmira, examining herself critically in the
                  looking-glass; "the old fright! She might have been dug out of the ruins of
                  Herculaneum, for all the youth and heauty she possesses Who ever heard of such
                  ridiculous vanity?"</p>
               <p>Elmira was not conscious that it was vanity equally ridiculous, which reigned in
                  her own breast, and caused a dislike to her aunt, for the resemblance which she
                  had pointed out, which all her injustice to Lelia, and coldness and incivility to
                  her uncle, had failed to inspire. Alas! for poor human nature.</p>
               <p>The next morning, Mr. Banks and his son breakfasted in their own apartment, and
                  almost all the servants in the household were put in requisition, to satisfy his
                  capricious desires.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clements and Charles took their seats at the breakfast-table, but the pallid
                  complexion of the former indicated that no refreshing slumbers had repaired his
                  enfeebled frame. As Mr. Manners observed the delicacy of his appearance, his
                  slight appetite, and that he was repeatedly obliged to put down his coffee, to
                  suppress a rising cough, his conscience upbraided him for his pusillanimous
                  conduct, and the image of his wife, once tenderly loved, seemed to rise before
                  him, in the person of her neglected brother. There was a gravity, too, on the fine
                  brow of his nephew, Charles, which he construed into a silent rebuke. Then Lelia
                  looked sad, and he was ashamed to meet her usually loving glance. His sister
                  appeared in one of her sour moods, and Elmira some-what sullen. Altogether he had
                  a very uncomfortable breakfast, and though he was glad when it was over, he did
                  not feel better satisfied with himself<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6687-00000069"/>
                  when seated with the same group around the fireside.</p>
               <p>The entrance of Mr. Banks and his tall son created a great sensation. Aunt Phillis
                  sprang to arrange his cushions, and made every one move from their places to give
                  him the best seat by the fire, and the most luxurious chair. He presented a most
                  imposing spectacle in his morning costume, wrapped in a wadded robe de chambre of
                  silver gray, lined with scarlet, a turban of yellow silk, white fur moccasins, and
                  gloves of similar materials. He nodded familiarly to all, as he sank down into his
                  cushions in a true oriental style, winked at Miss Phillis, chucked Lelia under the
                  chin, and slapped Charles on the shoulder, whose gravity gave place to
                  ill-suppressed mirth at his uncle's extraordinary figure.</p>
               <p>"I hope you rested well last night," said Miss Phillis; "that you found your room
                  comfortable."</p>
               <p>"Rested like a king," replied he; "warm as toast; chilled at first by damp sheets;
                  soon got over it; all right at last. How are you, brother?—look rather pale. Sleep
                  well, hey?"</p>
               <p>"I did not rest well," answered Mr. Clements; "I have a difficulty of breathing,
                  which often compels me to walk during the night. I feared I should disturb the
                  household by so doing."</p>
               <p>"Oh, uncle!" exclaimed Lelia—"and were you obliged to do so last night?"</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to distress you, my child," said he, taking her hand in his; "but
                  I walked my room the greater part of the night, and as I know it must be
                  unpleasant to those who may be contiguous to me; and as I perceive it is not
                  convenient to remain longer, I am sorry to say I must leave you this evening."</p>
               <p>"Oh, uncle!" again ejaculated Lelia, giving her father a look that spoke
                  volumes.</p>
               <p>"Must not think of such a thing," stammered Mr. Manners; "perfectly
                  convenient—very happy to see you—fear you haven't been as comfortable as you
                  should."</p>
               <p>"What's that you are talking of—going away?" interrupted Mr. Banks. "Sha'n't do
                  any such thing. Not convenient! Saw a room fit for a prince close to mine; not a
                  soul in it. Sleep there to-night. Walk till morning—won't wake one. Go
                  away!—nothing but pride. Hate to be outshone, hey? Empty pockets ache near full
                  ones."</p>
               <p>Here he put his hands in his pockets, and jingling some gold and silver, began one
                  of his interminable laughs.</p>
               <p>Miss Phillis saw that it was necessary, to redeem her reputation in the eyes of
                  Mr. Banks, to treat his brother with more civility. She condescended to make some
                  apology for the <emph>mistake</emph> of the preceding night, and promised to
                  prepare the apartment which Mr. Banks desired for him, if he would remain.</p>
               <p>Thus authorized, Mr. Manners became quite eloquent, and Lelia's eyes pleaded more
                  eloquently than all their words. Mr. Clements could not resist<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000070"/> their mute appeal, and declared his willingness to
                  remain.</p>
               <p>Cheerfulness was restored, and even Miss Phillis appeared amiable; for the
                  conviction that she had acted right, though forced into the path of duty, gave a
                  sweetened expression to her face, which elicited the evident admiration of Mr.
                  Banks, and added, in consequence, to her own self-elation.</p>
               <p>A week passed away, during which time the two uncles and their sons became
                  completely domesticated in the family of Mr. Manners. Mr. Banks continued to
                  assume the most amusing airs of superior grandeur, sported a most magnificent
                  wardrobe, flirted with Aunt Phillis, and pinched and kissed her nieces—while Mr.
                  Clements, mild, dignified and intellectual, wore the same thread-bare coat, and
                  the same nap-worn hat. Aunt Phillis, before whose eyes visions of wedded pomp and
                  splendour, bright as if called up by the wand of the genii, were constantly
                  floating, scarcely noticed his presence, as, according to her interpretation, he
                  seemed too conscious of his own insignificance to force himself upon the
                  observation of any one. Cousin Joe was still reserved, but as Elmira, according to
                  her aunt's instructions, paid him the most marked attention, he attached himself
                  more and more to her society, and it seemed more than probable that a double
                  wedding might take place. Lelia, who, in her pure singleness of heart, thought not
                  of conquests or weddings, felt a delight in the companionship of her Cousin
                  Charles, that, succeeding the dearth of all congenial feelings, had the power of
                  enchantment. The books which she had read alone, and which had enthralled her with
                  the master-spell of genius, acquired a double fascination, since they had
                  discoursed of their excellencies. He had a finely modulated voice, and when he
                  read aloud, she discovered that the dullest author had charms unknown before.
                  Lelia was very fond of drawing, and she now took unwonted pleasure in the exercise
                  of this accomplishment, for Charles had the painter's eye, as well as the poet's
                  tongue. And, in their hours of closer intimacy, when withdrawn from the bustling
                  circle too much occupied with their own interests to interfere with them, they sat
                  near Mr. Clements' side, who led them on to themes of high and holy import, and
                  thought and feeling came up from the innermost depths of the soul, and brightened
                  or darkened in the speaking eye—it was then that Lelia learned, that, while music,
                  painting, and poetry gave grace and beauty to his mind, a rich vein of philosophy,
                  and a still richer vein of religion, ran like golden ore through the whole texture
                  of her cousin's character. She had never been so happy in her life. Though it was
                  winter, and the trees were leafless, and the ground bleak and bare, she seemed
                  surrounded with the verdure of the aroma of perpetual summer. All above her was
                  sunshine, all beneath was flowers—for the affections of her ardent heart, which,
                  since her Aunt Lydia's death, had been yearning for some legitimate object, on
                  which to exercise their tenderness, had found one worthy of all their<pb
                     n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6687-00000071"/> strength and fervour, and on which they
                  expanded with unconscious warmth. But this is a working-day world, and life has
                     <emph>realities</emph> which often force us from the lovely
                     <emph>idealities,</emph> which hang their beautiful drapery over the machinery
                  of our existence. Lelia had one serious source of anxiety in the midst of her new
                  felicity—her uncle's coat; she could not bear to see his dignified figure clouded
                  by such a rusty garment. She was at first troubled that Charles should be so much
                  better dressed than his father, fearing that a tinge of selfishness tarnished the
                  lustre of his virtues; but her uncle had removed this fear, by accidentally
                  mentioning that the wardrobe of Charles was replenished by a friend, to whom he
                  was willing to be under obligations, trusting that he would be able to repay them,
                  by the exercise of his own talents, when he was once established in the world. Her
                  Aunt Phillis was in a high state of preparation for a large entertainment in
                  honour of Mr. Banks and his son. Lelia was distressed at the thought of her Uncle
                  Clements appearing at it in his shabby suit. She would have begged her father to
                  present him a new one, but remembering the scene about the bed-chamber, she
                  dreaded a similar refusal.</p>
               <p>"What a shame!" thought she, "that Uncle Banks should be revelling in affluence,
                  and suffer his brother to wear such poor apparel!" I should think pride, if no
                  better feeling, would incite him to a more just and generous conduct."</p>
               <p>An unexpected circumstance favoured her secret wishes. Her father had promised
                  Elmira and herself a set of jewels, when they first appeared in the raiments of
                  womanhood. The fulfilment of this promise had been deferred from time to time,
                  though Elmira often reminded him of it. Lelia, in the comparative seclusion of her
                  life, sighed for no such decorations, and now her mourning dress precluded them.
                  Mr. Manners, finding himself in a munificent vein, in consequence of the brilliant
                  prospects opening through his rich brother-in-law, gave them each the money
                  requisite for the purchase, and telling them to make their own selection, left
                  them, that they might consult their aunt upon the occasion.</p>
               <p>Lelia followed him with blushing earnestness. "Dear father," said she, "I thank
                  you more than I can express for your kindness. Yet I dare to ask for an additional
                  proof of your goodness. Would you be displeased if I appropriated this money to
                  another purpose than the jewels. I am in mourning now, and would rather not wear
                  them. Yet, if this is a gift to me, and I am permitted to use it as I would wish,
                  you will make me very happy."</p>
               <p>"Who ever heard of a young girl that did not want jewels before?" exclaimed Mr.
                  Manners, half incredulous of the correctness of his hearing.</p>
               <p>"What other purchase do you wish to make? I thought your wardrobe was well
                  supplied."</p>
               <p>"And so it is," replied Lelia, twisting her father's guard-chain round her
                  trembling fingers, for she feared he would question her too closely—"but—if you
                  will allow me to employ the money in the way I like best,<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000072"/> I will make no unworthy use of it. I will do
                  nothing which your own heart will not approve. Say yes, dear father, and do not
                  ask me to tell you any thing more."</p>
               <p>Lelia had such a beseeching way with her, it was impossible for any one but Aunt
                  Phillis to resist her. Mr. Manners was touched by her disinterestedness. Perhaps
                  his mind caught a glimpse of her purpose, and being ashamed that he had not
                  anticipated her, he forbore to ask her further questions.</p>
               <p>"You are a strange child," said he, smiling, "but I believe I must trust you this
                  time. Do what you like with it. It is your own."</p>
               <p>Lelia threw her arms around his neck, and gave him at least half a dozen kisses;
                  then running to her uncle's room, where he usually sat reading at this hour, she
                  knocked for admittance. She did not realize the delicacy of her office till she
                  stood before him, with a hue, deep as that of convicted guilt, dyeing her
                  cheeks.</p>
               <p>"What petition, or confession, do those blushes herald?" said he, laying down his
                  book, as she entered.</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, a petition, uncle, but I know not how to word it; I fear you will
                  be offended, and I could not brook your displeasure."</p>
               <p>"I do not think it possible for you to do any thing to offend me," answered he,
                  taking her hand in both his—"nor do I think I could refuse any petition you might
                  offer, 'even were it half of my kingdom.'"</p>
               <p>"Then take this trifle," said she, putting the paper which contained the money in
                  his hand, and clasping his fingers tightly around it, "and let me see my dear
                  uncle at Aunt Phillis' grand fete, as she calls it, in a new suit, which he must
                  wear, in honour of his, perhaps, too presumptuous niece."</p>
               <p>She dared not look in his face, and as he did not speak immediately, she feared he
                  was offended, and that the pride of poverty rebelled against the offering, but a
                  tear, which fell upon the hand which clapsed his, convinced her that his silence
                  was not that of haughtiness or resentment.</p>
               <p>"I can say, with your favourite Miranda, that 'I'm a fool to weep at what I'm glad
                  of,'" cried he at length, "for I do prize your gift, my Lelia, beyond all words.
                  Not that I attach much value to a new coat after all, but the feelings which
                  prompted the act, sanctify the offering in my eyes. I know you will not love me
                  more than you do in this old suit, which I must wrap up in lavender and
                  sweet-smelling shrubs, as a memento of my visit here—but strangers look at the
                  coat, and not at the man. There are a great many Aunt Phillises in the world, and
                  very few Lelias."</p>
               <p>Lelia felt so happy at the successful accomplishment of her wishes, that she went
                  warbling down stairs like a bird, and actually danced into the drawing-room, to
                  the horror of Aunt Phillis, who thought it an unpardonable sin for any one to
                  deviate from the straight forward and perpendicular lines of utility and
                  decorum.</p>
               <p>In the course of the evening, Elmira asked her sister<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000073"/> if she did not intend to go with her, in the
                  morning, to purchase the jewels.</p>
               <p>"Lelia don't care about jewels," said Mr. Manners, significantly, "she is a girl
                  in ten thousand."</p>
               <p>Lelia began to examine her work-box very industriously, and pretended not to hear
                  what they were saying.</p>
               <p>"I should not be surprised," said Elmira, laughingly, "if she put her money out at
                  interest, or in the saving banks, she's such a utilitarian."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she is going to establish a charity school," cried Aunt Phillis, with a
                  sneer. Mr. Banks not happening to be present, she thought she might relax a little
                  from her amiability.</p>
               <p>"To whatever use she has appropriated it," said Mr. Clements, "she will receive,
                  not only thirty, but sixty, nay an hundred fold."</p>
               <p>Charles, who sat beside his cousin, took up a spool of thread from her work-box,
                  and appeared to be scrutinizing its quality most earnestly, but he was in reality
                  watching her downcast face, and thinking it was scarcely a merit in Lelia to
                  sacrifice personal ornaments, since she was in herself so lovely and so loveable.
                  He knew the purpose to which she had devoted her father's gift, and he longed to
                  tell her of the gratitude and admiration she had inspired, but he would not wound
                  her modesty by confessing a knowledge of her disinterested goodness.</p>
               <p>"Are you going to take lessons in sewing, Charles?" asked Cousin Joe, unexpectedly
                  breaking silence. "I should judge so, by the interest you manifest for that
                  work-box." It was the first witticism Cousin Joe had attempted to make, and every
                  one laughed—Aunt Phillis seemed ready to fall into convulsions, for Joe was an
                  object of her homage, inferior only to his father.</p>
               <p>It is not our intention to give a minute description of Aunt Phillis' splendid
                  fete. It had the elaborate display and ceremony usual on such occasions, but
                  seldom is a fashionable party graced by such figures as Mr. Banks and Aunt Phillis
                  presented to the admiring eye. He wore a coat and small clothes of superb black
                  velvet, relieved by a vest of the deepest crimson, composed of the same rich
                  materials. White silk stockings, and golden knee-buckles; voluminous
                  shirt-ruffles, and multitudinous rings, distinguished the man of wealth from the
                  inferior throng. As Aunt Phillis promenaded up and down the saloon, leaning on his
                  arm, she believed herself the envy of every female heart, as well as the
                  admiration of every manly eye. She wore on this occasion, which she thought but
                  the prelude of a nuptial festival, a dress of white satin, trimmed with blonde, a
                  gossamer turban, profusely trimmed with pearls and flowers, among which the orange
                  blossom bloomed with prophetic sweetness. Lelia could have laughed at her aunt's
                     <emph>vehement</emph> affectation of juvenility, but she remembered that she
                  was a moral and immortal being, and sighed to see her thus twining with roses and
                  gems the sepulchre of youth. She saw her sister's neck and arms glittering with
                  jewels, and she did not repine, for her eye rested on her Uncle Clements, and she
                  would not have exchanged<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6687-00000074"/> changed her
                  feelings for the diamonds of Golconda. How well he looked in his new suit of deep
                  black! How she admired the soft shadows of silver gray that stole, like a mist,
                  over his jetty hair! How her heart throbbed as she met his affectionate smile, his
                  grateful, approving glance!</p>
               <p>Mr. Clements had another silent admirer. It was no other than Mr. Manners. He had
                  been watching his daughter's countenance; and, following the direction of her
                  eyes, he could not help sympathizing with her enthusiastic emotions. The freshness
                  and sensibility of life's earlier days, when her mother hung upon his arm a young
                  and confiding bride, came back upon him. He forgot the hardening lessons the world
                  had taught him, his pusillanimous submission to his sister's arbitrary sway—he was
                  once more a man and a father. Drawing near her, he was about to tell her that he
                  had discovered her secret, and that she need not fear his anger, when he saw
                  Charles anticipate him. The young man bent down and talked to her in a low voice,
                  and she answered him in the same tone. Moreover, there was an expression in the
                  young man's eyes very different from what cousins are wont to wear, and Lelia's
                  colour deepened, and flitted, and resolved at last into that roseate hue, which is
                  said to be emblamatic of something more than a cousin's love.</p>
               <p>"I must look to this," thought Mr. Manners, "he is a fine young fellow—but he is
                  too poor to think of marrying. I wish he were Mr. Banks' son, for Lelia's
                  sake."</p>
               <p>The father was once more merged in the man of the world. Nature yielded to
                  Gold.</p>
               <p>Aunt Phillis was too much excited that night to close her eyes in sleep. Mr. Banks
                  had done every thing but make a downright offer of himself. He had invited her and
                  Elmira to accompany them home, telling her that he wanted her to see his house and
                  grounds—to show her in what style he lived. She was to select a building spot for
                  his son, who was to have an establishment equal to Aladdin's palace—and over that
                  establishment, Elmira was destined to preside. The gray, wavering light of dawn,
                  saw Aunt Phillis still absorbed in the contemplation of her future grandeur. She
                  then sank into a kind of extatic doze, in which she beheld Mr. Banks' gold
                  knee-buckles glittering at her feet, where he had prostrated himself, in the act
                  of surrendering to her his heart, his hand, and his fortune.</p>
               <p>The time drew near for the departure of the two uncles. Aunt Phillis and Elmira
                  were so much occupied in arranging their apparel for the anticipated visit, they
                  had no leisure to notice the evident dejection of Lelia, or if they had, they
                  would have attributed it to envy at their superior good fortune.</p>
               <p>"Sorry for Lelia," said Mr. Banks, patting her on the head. "Good girl—pretty
                  girl—wish I had room in the carriage for you—why not go with Unle
                  Clements?—Ashamed to ask you? Charles going away. Be so lonely—what say, brother,
                  hey?"</p>
               <p>"That my poor home will be transformed into an Eden bower, with such a gentle,
                  ministering spirit<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6687-00000075"/> there. But what says
                  my dear niece? Would she consent to such a sacrifice? Charles has received a
                  commission which will take him immediately to a foreign land. I shall be indeed
                  most solitary."</p>
               <p>"Oh! willingly, gladly will I accompany you," cried Lelia, "if my father will
                  consent."</p>
               <p>That consent was not easily obtained; but when he considered that Charles was to
                  be absent, and the danger he feared would be thus averted, his greatest objection
                  was removed. Another very strong one remained, the want of female companionship.
                  This was obviated by Mr. Clements' description of his housekeeper—a most motherly
                  and estimable woman; and who would prove a sufficient guardian for his young
                  niece.</p>
               <p>"There are very few poor men," said Mr. Clements, "in the possession of such a
                  blessing, as this faithful and attached friend. She has remained with me during
                  all my misfortunes, serving me from attachment, that looks for no reward beyond
                  the exercise of its allotted duties."</p>
               <p>Mr. Manners at length consented that Lelia should accompany him, upon condition of
                  a speedy return. The departure of the travellers was deferred for some days, in
                  consequence of an unexpected movement on the part of Cousin Joe. He insisted that
                  he could not, and would not start till his union was consummated with Elmira, with
                  whom he seemed every moment more enamoured. Elmira, notwithstanding the chilling
                  influence of Aunt Phillis' worldly maxims and example, had some feelings true to
                  nature lingering in the depth of her heart. She thought she would not feel so
                  reluctant to this marriage, for reluctant she unaffectedly was, though she had
                  used all the arts of her sex, to allure him,—if Charles were not present. Aunt
                  Phillis thought upon the whole that it would be the height of gentility to have
                  the wedding take place on the morning of their journey, and then, on their return,
                  celebrate the nuptials by a large wedding party. Mr. Manners was well pleased with
                  the match, and as all the higher powers were propitious, Elmira thought it best to
                  smile and be propitious too.</p>
               <p>Just before the wedding, Aunt Phillis took Elmira aside, and after a long preamble
                  about the importance of commencing the married life with grace and propriety,
                  said, "Remember, my dear, that there is a great deal in the name you will bear;
                  that is, there is a fashionable and unfashionable style of addressing a married
                  woman. You must not allow any one to call you Mrs. Elmira Banks, or young Mrs.
                  Banks—but Mrs. Joseph Banks. That will be a sufficient distinction. When the
                  senior Mr. Banks—when <emph>I</emph> am married, (there is no use in speaking in
                  inuendoes,) I intend to be called simply Mrs. Banks. Remember, my dear, Mrs.
                  Joseph Banks."</p>
               <p>Poor Aunt Phillis, she was already trembling, at the idea of being styled old Mrs.
                  Banks, and seeking to avert the impending calamity. Lelia beheld, with unspeakable
                  agitation, the preparations for her sister's nuptials. She knew she did not love
                  her future bridegroom, and that the gold for which she was about to sacrifice the
                  truthfulness of nature, and the bloom of<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6687-00000076"
                  /> youth—would never fill the aching void felt by the craving heart, too late made
                  sensible of its capacities for happiness.</p>
               <p>"God has no blessing for such unhallowed vows," said she to herself, as she stood
                  pale and tearful by her sister's side, during the nuptial ceremony. When the
                  benediction was pronounced and the bride ready to receive the congratulations of
                  her friends, Lelia could not speak—she could only lean her head on Elmira's
                  shoulder and weep.</p>
               <p>"Don't cry, Lelia," whispered Elmira; "when you and Charles live in your log cabin
                  together, in the wild woods, you'll forget all about me."</p>
               <p>"Let me be the first to congratulate Mrs. Joseph Banks, on her new name," said
                  Aunt Phillis, advancing and saluting the bride, with inimitable grace.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Joseph Banks!" repeated Mr. Banks. "Very good, young Mrs. Banks! Very good!
                  By and by, there will be old Mrs. Banks—will there not, hey?" pinching Aunt
                  Phillis' arm, who thought proper to resent the familiarity, by drawing away her
                  arm and tossing up her head with unexpected disdain. The next moment, fearing she
                  might offend him by her too manifest resentment of the odious cognomen, she looked
                  back upon him, with a coquettish smile, and said something about his being a
                  privileged wit.</p>
               <p>The carriage rolled up to the door with a magnificent sweep. The bride and
                  bridegroom were seated first—then Mr. Banks, who seemed to be completely cured of
                  the gout, helped Aunt Phillis to ascend, who sprang up the steps, as light as a
                  fawn, threw back her veil and kissed her hand to those she was leaving behind. It
                  was a long time before Mr. Banks was arranged to his own satisfaction, and it was
                  not till Aunt Phillis had squeezed herself into the smallest possible compass, he
                  declared himself comfortably seated.</p>
               <p>"Fine horses these, brother," said he, putting his head out of the window; "sweep
                  like the wind. Ride like a king! Poor Lelia! don't cry—wish there was room. Take
                  you next time—bye, bye."</p>
               <p>The noble horses, which had been pawing the ground, impatient of their long
                  restraint, bounded forward, at the first touch of the whip, and the carriage was
                  soon out of sight. But as long as it was seen, the white handkerchief of Aunt
                  Phillis waved from the window, like an oriflamme of victory. The stage, which
                  brought Mr. Clements and his son, was soon at the door.</p>
               <p>"I do not think I can part with you, after all," said Mr. Manners, retaining Lelia
                  in a parting embrace—"I shall be too lonely."</p>
               <p>"Then come with us," said Mr. Clements, "and let me reciprocate, as far as I am
                  able, the hospitality I have received under your roof."</p>
               <p>"That cuts rather close," thought Mr.Manners.</p>
               <p>"Come with us," said Charles. "Then Lelia will not carry a divided heart."</p>
               <p>Lelia echoed these invitations most earnestly, and, to his own astonishment, he
                  found himself in a few minutes seated in the stage-coach, at his daughter's<pb
                     n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6687-00000077"/> side, about to make an extempore visit
                  to his poor relation.</p>
               <p>As Aunt Phillis is in reality the heroine of this tale, we feel it a proper
                  tribute of respect to follow her course, in preference to the unambitious Lelia.
                  It is not our intention to follow the minutiæ of a journey which required many
                  days to accomplish, for we are as anxious as she was to reach the home which had
                  so long been looming on the restless sea of her maiden fancy. The last day, their
                  road lay through a rough, hilly country, which gave many a jolt to her weary
                  sides, and aching limbs. They rode through leafless forests, which seemed
                  stretching into "a boundless contiguity of space," and through which the wintry
                  winds whistled, making most melancholy music. Long and anxiously did the bride
                  real, and the <emph>bride apparent,</emph> gaze from the carriage windows,
                  straining their eyes to catch a glimpse of the distant spires of Banksville, where
                  they were to enjoy the realization of their golden dreams. It was a grey, misty,
                  dreary looking day, and towards evening the mist condensed into clouds, and the
                  clouds descended in a drizzling rain, which completely obscured the country, and
                  made the travellers fold their cloaks more closely round them, and draw towards
                  each other with more affectionate familiarity.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am so tired!" exclaimed Aunt Phillis, leaning her head against Mr. Banks'
                  ample shoulder; "shall we never reach home? You told me three hours ago it was
                  only ten miles to Banksville."</p>
               <p>"Don't be impatient," replied he, "soon be there. Chrrming place; get a fine
                  supper; rest like princes."</p>
               <p>It was a late, dark hour, when the travellers reached the termination of their
                  journey. Aunt Phillis and Elmira had both fallen back into a deep slumber, from
                  which they were scarcely aroused by the sudden cessation of the motion of the
                  carriage, and the voice of Uncle Banks, bidding them wake up, and cheer up, for
                  they had got home at last. With stiffened limbs, and bewildered capacities, the
                  film of sleep still lingering on their eye-lids, they were assisted from the
                  carriage, and led stumbling along over a rough pathway towards a low dwelling
                  intrenched in a cluster of forest trees, whose branches made coarse net-work over
                  the roof.</p>
               <p>"Where are we going?" cried Aunt Phillis. "What sort of a place is this? Oh,
                  dear!—I can scarcely see my hand before me."</p>
               <p>"Never mind," said Uncle Banks; "see soon enough. Hallo, there"—giving a
                  thundering rap at the door—"bring a light here. Ho—quick!—a light for the
                  ladies!"</p>
               <p>A heavy step was heard lingering near the door, which being swung open wide,
                  displayed a large clumsy-formed girl, dressed in linsey-woolsey garments, with
                  sleeves rolled up to her elbows, holding a candle in one hand, and shading her
                  eyes with the other.</p>
               <p>"La, Mr. Banks, if it isn't you! Bless my stars! here are ladies, sure
                  enough!"</p>
               <p>"Open the parlour directly. Run and make up a<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000078"/> fire—good fire—blazing fire"—cried Mr. Banks,
                  taking the candle and leading the way for his shivering guests.</p>
               <p>"What are you stopping for, at this ugly old place, when we are so near home?"
                  asked Aunt Phillis, mechanically following him, while cold, fearful drops began to
                  gather on her darkening brow.</p>
               <p>"Joseph, I thought you said we were to get home to-night," said Elmira, in a
                  trembling, reproachful voice, sinking down into the first chair she saw, half dead
                  with fatigue and indefinite apprehension.</p>
               <p>"Home!" repeated Uncle Banks, rubbing his hands exultingly together, "and what
                  should this be, but home? New place, to be sure—going to be a palace by-and-by—not
                  quite finished yet. Welcome to Banksville, my dear—fine place, isn't it, hey?"</p>
               <p>"Home!" screamed Aunt Phillis, lifting up both hands almost as high as the
                  ceiling—rolling her eyes round the unpapered and unpainted walls, up on the
                  unlathed rafters, then into the huge chimney, where the large girl was piling pine
                  knots higher than her head, and whose broad glare soon illuminated the whole
                  apartment—"Home!—home!—did you say?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, home!" shouted Uncle Banks, from the very top of his lungs. "Deaf all at
                  once, hey? Good home as ever was—plenty of room—plenty of wood—plenty of things to
                  eat. What more do you want? Come, take off your cloak—set down by the fire—no
                  ceremony here."</p>
               <p>Aunt Phillis looked steadily in his face, without winking—her eyes dilated to
                  their utmost dimensions, for more than a minute, and he looked steadily at her,
                  smiling and winking all the time. The girl in the chimney stopped blowing the
                  fire, and looked from one to the other, grinning and coughing, displaying two
                  full-length rows of unbroken ivory.</p>
               <p>"Oh my stars," shrieked Aunt Phillis, clapping both hands tightly on her head, and
                  throwing herself back in a chair,—"Oh! my head—it will burst—I can't breathe—I
                  shall suffocate—I shall die. Here," to the grinning girl, "unloosen my cloak—untie
                  my bonnet—give me a glass of water." The last words were uttered in a calmer
                  voice. The idea, that notwithstanding the awful delusions respecting the splendour
                  of Banksville, under which she had been labouring, she could induce him to build a
                  house to her own taste, out of his hoarded treasures, came like a good angel and
                  checked the outpouring of her anger. "It is very strange," said she, in a
                  hysterical giggle, "that a gentleman of your fortune should be willing to live
                  so—so simply."</p>
               <p>"My fortune!" repeated Mr. Banks, "fortune enough. Own this lot and farm—plenty
                  for me—all the rest a false report. No matter—thought I'd try my friends—make a
                  frolic of it. No harm done—no sham here," striking his hand on his expansive
                  chest.</p>
               <p>"But your carriage?" gasped Aunt Phillis.</p>
               <p>"Borrowed."</p>
               <p>"Your fine clothes?</p>
               <p>"All borrowed—hey."</p>
               <p>Aunt Phillis started up on her feet, quivering with<pb n="174-175"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000079"/> passion. "You wretch—you monster," she
                  exclaimed—"you deceiver—you jack-daw in peacock's plumes! I'll prosecute you for
                  an impostor. I'll have you put in a penitentiary—set in the pillory—transported to
                  Botany Bay. To entrap in this vile way my unsuspecting innocence. To lure me on to
                  the brink of matrimony—to make me the laughing stock of the whole world."</p>
               <p>Uncle Banks put his hands in his pockets and began one of his silent laughs.</p>
               <p>"To think of my waiting upon you as if you were the grand Sultan himself,"
                  continued she, after taking a fresh inspiration. "Of my tending your old gouty
                  feet—yea, holding them in my very lap."</p>
               <p>"Hey diddle, diddle, the cat's in the fiddle," cried he, getting up and frisking a
                  little, to show the soundness of his limbs. "Good feet as any body's feet. No more
                  gout than you have. Ready for a reel this minute."</p>
               <p>"Take us home directly, unfeeling wretch," cried the unhappy spinster. "I'll never
                  sleep in this miserable hovel—I'll perish in the woods first."</p>
               <p>Uncle Banks, who had enjoyed sufficiently the rage and mortification of Aunt
                  Phillis, seemed to feel real compassion for the distress of the weeping Elmira.
                  "Poor girl," said he, kindly patting her on the shoulder, "don't take on so—Joe
                  loves you—he's young and strong—be a rich man yet. Every tree of the West has a
                  treasure of gold in its trunk. I'm getting old—tired of the seas—lost my
                  money—wanted at home—wanted rest—folks heard I'd got a great fortune—it wasn't my
                  fault—didn't mean to make you unhappy—thought you loved Joe—good boy—make you a
                  good husband."</p>
               <p>Elmira, who, weary and half stunned, seemed in a passive state, did not answer,
                  but when Joe, encouraged by his father, ventured to sit down by her and take her
                  hand in his, and she did not snatch it away, Uncle Banks thought it a propitious
                  omen, and drawing the back of his hand across his eyes, he did not speak for a few
                  moments.</p>
               <p>Aunt Phillis, completely exhausted, leaned against the wall. Her bonnet, partly
                  untied, rested on the back of her head; her turban, disarranged by the jolting of
                  the carriage and her own wrathful gestures, was poked on one side, revealing one
                  or two stiff grey locks, while her long dark ringlets, uncurled by the rain, clung
                  to her cheeks and chin with mournful adhesiveness. The corners of her mouth were
                  drawn down into acute angles; the corners of her eyebrows lifted up in
                  corresponding angles in an opposite direction; her nose looked sharpened into a
                  severer point. Shakspeare knew nothing of melancholy madness. He had never seen
                  Aunt Phillis Manners.</p>
               <p>Nothwithstanding the rough appearance of this lodge, in the wilderness of the
                  boundless west, where the storm-wrecked and eccentric mariner had found a
                  sheltered haven of rest, it was comfortable and looked even cheerful, illumined as
                  it now was by the blazing pine knots, which crackled and corruscated in the vast
                  chimney, and filled every nook and crevice with<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000080"/> the brightness of noon-day. A good substantial
                  supper was soon spread before them by the "maid of all-work," but no one but Uncle
                  Banks tasted a morsel. He seemed to have lost entirely the fastidiousness of his
                  appetite, and eat of every dish with the keenest relish.</p>
               <p>Aunt Phillis did not prowl into the woods, as she had threatened, but threw
                  herself down on her humble bed in a state resembling despair. The cup of her wrath
                  had foamed over, and she was now drinking in silence the bitter dregs; the veriest
                  lees of the wine of life. She felt, as we may suppose, as the æronaut feels, who,
                  after rising majestically into the blue convexity of Heaven, leaving far below the
                  grossness and opacity of earth, breathing the elasticity of a rarer, purer
                  atmosphere, almost hearing the music of the empyrean, and catching glimpses of the
                  palace of the Sun, when, suddenly, the gas explodes, the airy chariot falls, and
                  he comes tumbling headlong from his glorious height, into some muddy pool, with
                  bruised frame, broken bones and shaking brains.</p>
               <p>For hours she lay, planning schemes of unexampled vengeance, which for variety and
                  originality, might have shamed the torments of the fabled Tartarus, till an
                  appalling consciousness of her own impotence, and the ridiculousness of her
                  wrongs, checked the ingenuity of her revenge. She resolved at length to get home,
                  as speedily and quietly as possible, to say nothing to her brother, or any of her
                  friends, of her disappointment, and thus screen herself from the derision which
                  she knew would be her portion. Elmira's feelings were not deep, nor her passions
                  strong. Her character had been moulded by circumstances, and it was easily
                  remoulded. After the first ebullition of sorrow and chagrin, convinced that her
                  destiny was fixed, she submitted with a comparative good grace—determining, in her
                  own mind, that her father should build her a fine house, and that the world should
                  never know how deceived she had been. Besides, Joe was so really affectionate and
                  kind, she could not continue sullen and resentful—and ill-humour looked so
                  unlovely and forbidding in her aunt, that she struggled against its mastery.</p>
               <p>"Carry you home again," said Mr. Banks, "in the same carriage that brought
                  you—don't want to keep folks against their will—ought to be glad of such a fine
                  ride. Daughter may go too, till we get her a house built. Be happy as a queen
                  yet—mustn't be angry at uncle—all for the best—married Joe—not his purse. Fine
                  boy—hey?"</p>
               <p>With what different emotions did Aunt Phillis find herself seated in the same
                  carriage with the same party, the day but one after her arrival. She wouldn't
                  condescend to sit on the same seat with Mr. Banks, but making Elmira occupy that
                  post of honour, to the great displeasure of Cousin Joe, placed herself opposite,
                  and if the lightning of her eyes could have withered, Mr. Banks would have been
                  nothing but a shrivelled scroll. He seemed in imperturbable good humour, singing
                  and laughing so merrily, that Elmira caught the infection, and smiled and even
                  laughed. The third day of their journey, the aspect of the<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000081"/> country changed. It was no longer the same road
                  they had travelled before—Aunt Phillis noticed the change, and peevishly asked to
                  what new cities they were going.</p>
               <p>"Going to stop to-night at a friend's," answered Uncle Banks. "Good friend—loaned
                  me this carriage—lent me my velvet suit and jewels—capital fellow—rich as a
                  Jew—lives like a prince—catch <emph>him</emph> perhaps—hey?"</p>
               <p>Aunt Phillis disdained to answer, supposing he was going to take her to another
                  log-cabin and some companion of congenial coarseness. Night came on, a clear,
                  cold, moonlight night, when the atmosphere itself looked all white and silvery,
                  and the pebbly ground sparkled like diamonds. The horses went faster and faster,
                  and struck fire from their resounding hoofs. Uncle Banks' spirits rose at every
                  turning of the wheels. He sang every verse of "Cease rude Boreas," "Black-eyed
                  Susan," and "The Jolly Tar," keeping time with his feet and hands, while Aunt
                  Phillis kept dodging her head this way and that, and drawing her feet under her
                  clothes to avoid coming in contact with him. At length the carriage rolled over a
                  smoother road—regular rows of lofty trees, grand and lordly even in the wintry
                  nakedness, skirted the way-side—the illuminated windows of a large white dwelling,
                  with white columns supporting a piazza, that surrounded the whole building, over
                  which perennial vines were clustering, became defined on the luminous back-ground
                  of the starry heaven.</p>
               <p>"This <emph>is</emph> a fine house, to be sure," said Aunt Phillis, in a more
                  gracious tone, as the carriage stopped at the door. "It is pleasant to see a
                  Christian-looking habitation once more."</p>
               <p>"No need of knocking," said Uncle Banks, leading the way up the flight of marble
                  steps, to the entrance—"old acquaintance—no ceremony."</p>
               <p>He entered the hall, then throwing back the folding doors, displayed to the
                  astonished eyes of Aunt Phillis, a scene which she thought some wizard wand had
                  conjured. Seated at a table in the centre of the apartment, beneath the soft
                  lustre of a moonlight lamp, sat her brother, reading a newspaper, as much at ease,
                  as if he had been domesticated there all his life, and directly opposite was Mr.
                  Clements, so intently engaged with a book that he did not notice the opening of
                  the door. And on a sofa, a little in the back-ground of the picture, Charles and
                  Lelia were sitting side by side, engaged in such earnest and interesting
                  conversation, it is doubtful whether the entrance of Xerxes and his army would
                  have diverted their attention from each other.</p>
               <p>"Well done, kinsfolk!" exclaimed Uncle Banks, giving his brother a rousing slap on
                  the shoulder. "Can't you see a body, hey? Brought Cousin Phillis to make you a
                  visit. Wasn't pleased with Banksville, may be she'll like Clementsville better.
                  Ha—little sweetheart playing puss in the corner there. Come and kiss your
                  uncle."</p>
               <p>"Welcome, Cousin Phillis," said Mr. Clements, shaking her cordially by the hand,
                  "many thanks for this unexpected honour. I shall be most happy to<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000082"/> repay you, according to my poor ability, some of
                  the obligations I owe you."</p>
               <p>"So you've all been making a fool of me," cried she, unable to suppress the
                  overflowing of her passions. "Pretending to be poor, when you're rich, and rich
                  when you're poor, just to make a gull of me—and that little hypocrite knew it all
                  the time," shaking her forefinger at Lelia, with a familiar gesture, "she knew it
                  all. She acted her part as well as the rest of you. You've every one been in a
                  conspiracy against me. Yes—every one—not excepting my own brother."</p>
               <p>Here she threw herself back on the sofa and covering her face with her
                  handkerchief, rocked to and fro, in hysterical agony.</p>
               <p>"There is no use in recrimination now, sister," said Mr. Manners. "We have both
                  been taught a good lesson, by which I hope I shall profit, as long as I live. But
                  you must not accuse Lelia. She was the only one of us, who loved her uncle and
                  cousin for themselves alone; and verily, she hath found her reward," added he,
                  giving Charles a look, that might have made any young man proud.</p>
               <p>"Come, Cousin Phillis," said Mr. Clements, "let us forget and forgive. We have all
                  been playing a little farce, which has made us somewhat better acquainted with
                  human nature, and with the mysteries of our own hearts. Having received a splendid
                  accession to my fortunes, while still a resident in a foreign land, which rumour,
                  by mistake, gave to my sailor brother here, I yielded to his whim, and allowed
                  myself to be thought poor and himself rich, as had been previously reported to
                  you. I had some misgivings as to the propriety of the deception; but since I have
                  discovered such a treasury of disinterested affection, in this beloved child,"
                  drawing Lelia to his bosom as he spoke—"this child, who is as much lifted above
                  hypocrisy as the heavens are above the earth, and since I have secured the
                  happiness of my son, by a promised union with so much loveliness and virtue, I
                  cannot regret the masquerade we wore. Yes, Lelia—I would not exchange this coat,
                  this dress given to your <emph>poor</emph> uncle, for the ermine of royalty. Its
                  history shall be recorded in the family archive and handed down even to your
                  children's children. Elmira, your husband is not a poor man, for he shall share of
                  my inheritance, and yet make himself a name and a fame in the growing West."</p>
               <p>"Come, Cousin Phillis," cried Uncle Banks. "Rub out old scores. Kiss and be
                  friends. Don't spoil your eyes. Catch a rich sweetheart yet—maybe. Hain't got the
                  chink—can't help it—don't want it—clear head—sound limbs, stout heart—good
                  conscience—wealth enough for me. Isn't that enough—hey?"</p>

               <head>The Mob Cap; or, my Grandmother's Crunk.</head>
               <p>IT was past midnight, and the moon had gone down when the stage stopped at Edward
                  Stanley's lodgings, who was about to visit his village home. The lamps threw a
                  strong glare on the pavements, but the interior of the vehicle was in such deep
                  shade, he could but imperfectly distinguish his fellow travellers.</p>
               <p>He observed, however, that several young gentlemen occupied the front and middle
                  seats, while an old woman, muffled in a cloak, sat alone on the back one. She
                  turned her head sharply round as he entered, and the light glimmering under her
                  large hood was brightly reflected from a pair of spectacles of such spacious
                  dimensions, they seemed to cover her whole face, or at least all the face that was
                  visible through the wide-plaited border of a mob cap. Edward took the only vacant
                  seat in the stage, at her side, with a very respectful bow, which was received
                  with something between a hem and a cough, a sound diverting in itself, and
                  rendered still more so, by its echo from the opposite seat; for the young
                  gentlemen seemed determined to derive all the amusement possible from their
                  antiquated companion. Edward had a convivial spirit, but he had too deep a
                  reverence for age ever to make it a subject for mirth. It was in itself a
                  sufficient guarantee for veneration, even when unaccompanied by those traits which
                  impart a beauty to the faded brow, and to the hoary head a crown of glory. The
                  recollection of his own grandmother, too, who had died since his absence from
                  home—one of those fine, dignified relics of the majestic simplicity of olden time,
                  which reminds one so forcibly of the degeneracy of modern days—gave a tenderness
                  to his manners, in addressing an aged person, which was peculiarly engaging in the
                  present instance, from the effect of contrast.</p>
               <p>"Take care, grandmother," said the young men opposite, as the stage jolted over a
                  huge stone, "take care of your spectacles. We shall upset, now, depend upon
                  it."</p>
               <p>"No thanks to you if we don't," cried she, muttering, in the indistinct accents of
                  age. Then turning towards Edward, she continued, "It is really refreshing to see a
                  well-behaved, decent young gentleman, after enduring the impertinence of the
                  dandies and jacknapes. Never mind, you may laugh now as loud as you please; but if
                  you live, you will be old yourself one of these days."</p>
               <p>She put her hand into her pocket, which seemed unfathomable in depth, and drawing
                  out a snuff-box, after rapping it several times, she presented it to Edward, who
                  was obliged from politeness to take a pinch, and all the passengers petitioning
                  for a similar favour, a sneezing concert commenced, in which the old lady herself
                  acted the most sonorous part. After the mirth occasioned by this chorus had
                  subsided, she dropped her box into her pocket, and it sunk like a pebble
                  descending into a vault. Edward began to<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6687-00000084"
                  /> enjoy his journey exceedingly; he never felt disposed to sleep in a stage
                  coach, and the old lady declared herself of the same temperament, though he
                  gallantly offered his shoulder as a pillow, to the great amusement of the others,
                  who were, ere long, nodding their heads to and fro, occasionally knocking their
                  heads against each other, or reclining backwards in more unsocial attitudes.
                  Edward and his muffled companion fell into the most familiar and agreeable
                  conversation. She seemed very shrewd and original in her remarks, and exercised
                  the privilege of age in inquiring his name, the place of his residence,
                  &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"Ah," said she, "I knew you had a mother and sisters—or a sister whom you loved,
                  from your kindness to me, an old woman, and a stranger. Heaven be blessed for the
                  influence of gentle ones on the heart of man. And you are going to the village of
                  ——. Do you know any thing of the Widow Clifton, daughter of Squire Lee, who lives
                  somewhere in those parts?"</p>
               <p>"Not personally—but report says she is such a gay dashing character. I suppose she
                  will find herself very much out of place in a country town. I hear, through my
                  sister, that she is to take possession of her late father's dwelling, which has
                  been fitted up for her accommodation in quite a princely style. You speak as if
                  you knew her, madam."</p>
               <p>"Yes, for I was a great friend to her grandmother; a fine old lady as ever lived,
                  a thousand time handsomer than Gertrude—but very likely you may not agree with me.
                  Young eyes see differently from old ones."</p>
               <p>"Is she young?" asked Edward.</p>
               <p>"Yes, she is scarcely twenty, for she married, poor thing, at a very early age,
                  and was left a widow soon after. She has need of more discretion than she has now,
                  or ever will have."</p>
               <p>"I should like to see this gay young widow," said Edward, musingly, the vision of
                  a pair of heavenly blue eyes that he had seen stealing softly before him, "but it
                  is not likely that we shall become acquainted, for my mother and sister live very
                  retired, and when I am at home I devote myself to them."</p>
               <p>It was surprising in what confidential terms he was addressing his new
                  acquaintance, and how entirely he forgot to ask her name and residence, though he
                  had so freely imparted his own.</p>
               <p>As the morning air came chill and dewy over the hill, she drew her cloak more
                  closely around her, pulled down her hood, and seemed drowsy and silent. Edward was
                  not sorry to be left a while to his own reflections. He thought of the mild eyes
                  of his mother, at that very moment, perhaps, turned towards the window, anxiously
                  watching his coming, of the more eager anticipations of his only sister, and more
                  than all, he thought upon "the witching smile that caught his youthful fancy."</p>
               <p>He was roused from his reveries by the sudden stopping of the stage, and he found
                  he was to be separated from his ancient friend. Jumping out with as much alacrity
                  as if he were in attendance on youth<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6687-00000085"/>
                  and beauty, he assisted her as she descended with slow and difficult steps; and
                  opening the gate for her to pass, gave her a cordial and respectful farewell.</p>
               <p>"I shall not soon forget you, young gentleman," said she, holding out her
                  tremulous hand, "and if the time ever comes when I can serve you, you will find
                  the aged can remember the kindness of youth."</p>
               <p>Resuming his seat, his thoughts winged their way towards the home he was now
                  rapidly approaching. In two or three hours, he began to distinguish the trees
                  familiar to his boyhood. A little farther, a majestic elm stretched its lordly
                  branches over the street, they passed, on either side, the landmark of his
                  school-day pastimes. Then a white house glimmered through the green foliage that
                  overshadowed it,—and a moment more, Edward was in the arms of his mother, with his
                  sister clinging round his neck. An only son and brother, returned after twelve
                  months' absence, to beings whose best affections were garnered in him, might
                  reasonably call forth warm and joyous emotions. A shade, however, passed over
                  their brows, as the saddened glance of Edward rested on the easy chair, where he
                  had last beheld that venerable form with placid brows, crowned with living silver,
                  now laid low in the dust—and they all <emph>remembered the dead.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>A year's residence in the heart of a city, would naturally produce some change in
                  a young man, as yet only in the morning of manhood, and as Clara's admiring eyes
                  ran over the face and figure of her brother, she blushed at her own rusticity.
                  There was an indescribable something in his air and manner, that told he had been
                  in a region different from her own, and a shadow of awe began to steal over the
                  deep love she felt for him. Mrs. Stanley, whose chastened and pious thoughts were
                  dwelling on the inner man, rejoiced that his heart remained unchilled during his
                  intercourse with the world, for the fountain of filial tenderness was still full
                  and gushing over.</p>
               <p>Edward Stanley was poor—that is, he had only his own inborn energies to carry him
                  through the world. He had just completed his studies as a lawyer, having finished
                  his last year with one of the most distinguished members of the bar, a friend of
                  his late father, who, though he died poor in one sense of the word, was rich in
                  the good opinions of his fellow-men. Edward was resolved it should prove a year of
                  probation, and adhered to his determination not to suffer even the holiest
                  interest of nature to turn him aside from his steadfast course. The trial was
                  past—he was admitted to the bar—and now felt privileged to rest and refresh
                  himself for a while at the well-springs of the heart.</p>
               <p>That evening, as he looked abroad and saw the moon sending down such rills of
                  light through the deep shades of the landscape, he thought how beautiful Fanny
                  Morton had looked when she stood, a year ago, in the midst of such silver waves,
                  and he longed to know how she would look then, standing in the selfsame moonbeams.
                  The wish was easily accomplished, for her father's house was but a short distance
                  from his own, and he soon found himself near the threshold.<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000086"/> The house was situated a little retreating from the
                  street, and the path that led to it was soft and grassy, lying too in a thick
                  shadow, so his approach was not perceived. There she stood, almost in the same
                  attitude, leaning against the door, looking upwards with eyes so deeply,
                  beautifully blue, they seemed to have borrowed the colour from the night heaven to
                  which their gaze was directed. Her fair, flaxen hair glittered in the moonlight
                  with a golden lustre, brightly contrasting with the pure whiteness of a brow,
                  where the serenity of youth and innocence was now softly reposing.</p>
               <p>"Fanny!" said Edward, emerging from the shadow; and she sprang forward at the well
                  known voice, with a bounding step, and a joyous smile.</p>
               <p>"Edward, I am so glad you are come."</p>
               <p>Her manner was so frank and affectionate, it relieved him from the agitation he
                  felt in addressing her. Perhaps he felt a disappointment in meeting her childish
                  expression of pleasure, instead of the deep silence of joy, for it is certain the
                  romance of his feelings considerably subsided, and he uttered some commonplace
                  sayings, instead of the high-wrought sentiments in which he had been indulging. He
                  had never told Fanny in so many words that he loved her, but they had lived in
                  almost daily interchange of offices prompted by affection. In absence he had
                  blended her image with every memory of the past and every hope of the future, and
                  now in her presence, he acknowledged that she was fairer and lovelier than even
                  the visions his fancy had drawn. The people of the village seeing Fanny again the
                  constant companion of Edward and Clara Stanley, as in former times, prophesied a
                  speedy union, though they dwelt on the excessive imprudence of the match, as they
                  were both too poor to think of marrying, and many declared Fanny to be no better
                  than a piece of painted wax-work, fit only to be looked at and admired.</p>
               <p>They were returning one evening, about sunset, from a walk in the woodland. Fanny
                  was literally covered with garlands, which Edward and Clara had woven, and with
                  her hat swinging in her hand, and her fair locks unbound, she formed the most
                  picturesque feature of a landscape, then rich in all the glories of summer. They
                  turned aside from the path, for the trampling of horses' feet were behind
                  them.</p>
               <p>"Look, brother, look!" exclaimed Clara, as a lady, in company with two gentlemen,
                  rode gaily by. She was dressed in green. Her long riding-dress swept far below her
                  feet, and waving feathers of the same colour mingled with the folds of a veil
                  which floated lightly on the breeze. She turned and looked earnestly at Fanny,
                  who, blushing at her fantastical appearance, drew behind Clara, when the veil of
                  the stranger suddenly loosened, and, fluttering, fell at Edward's feet. Never was
                  a fairer opening for gallantry. The lady checked her spirited horse, and, bending
                  gracefully forward, received the veil from the hands of Edward, with a smile and a
                  bow that would have repaid any man for a greater exertion. Her complexion was
                  dark, but richly coloured with the warm hues of exercise<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000087"/> ercise and health; and when she smiled, her eyes
                  were so brilliantly black, and her teeth so glitteringly white, that Clara could
                  talk of nothing else for an hour after she reached home—and Edward caught himself
                  wondering several times, who the lady of the green plumes could be.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he, suddenly, when he saw, at night, lights gleaming from the windows
                  of the great white house on the hill—"It must be Mrs. Clifton, the dashing
                  widow."</p>
               <p>And Mrs. Clifton it proved to be, whose arrival caused no slight sensation in this
                  quiet village—Edward and Fanny were quite forgotten in the superior claims of one,
                  who, though among them, was not of them. One represented her as proud as Lucifer,
                  sweeping through the streets, with her officer-like cap and feathers,—another, as
                  a lioness, leaping her horse over hedges and walls. Some represented her as dark
                  as an Ethiopian, terrible and grand—and others, as beautiful as an angel, and
                  blithe as a wood-nymph. Meanwhile the unconscious object of these contradictory
                  and mostly invidious remarks, continued her rides over hill and dale with
                  unwearied activity, and sometimes she appeared in a splendid carriage, with a
                  footman, who was said to be dressed in livery, though he wore a suit of sober
                  gray.</p>
               <p>What was the astonishment of Clara Stanley, when she saw one morning this splendid
                  carriage stop at her own door, and Mrs. Clifton herself descend from it! Clara's
                  next feeling was deep mortification; for both her mother and herself were dressed
                  in plain calico mourning frocks, and the room was in a state of particular
                  disorder, for she was occupied in cutting and arranging work, and her brother had
                  covered the table with papers he was about to examine.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edward," cried Clara, "if there's not Mrs. Clifton! what shall we do?"</p>
               <p>"Do?" said he, laughing and starting up eagerly—"Why ask her to come in;" and with
                  an ease and self-possession that almost provoked the mortified Clara, he met this
                  startling visitor at the threshold.</p>
               <p>She introduced herself with so much grace and politeness, and fell into
                  conversation so rapidly and simply, apologizing for what she feared might be
                  deemed an intrusion, but expressing an earnest wish to become acquainted with
                  neighbours in whose society she anticipated so much pleasure, so naturally and
                  sincerely, that Clara's burning cheeks began to cool, and her confused senses to
                  be sufficiently collected to appreciate so signal an honour. Mrs. Stanley was too
                  truly refined and well bred to share in her daughter's embarrassment. She was not
                  ashamed of the simplicity of their dress, and she did not look upon the proofs of
                  Clara's industry and Edward's literature, scattered about the room, as at all
                  disgraceful. Moreover, she was very proud of her son, and thought she had never
                  seen him appear to such an advantage as at this moment, when engaged in animated
                  conversation with this graceful and charming lady. Mrs. Clifton admired the
                  garden, the vines that made such fairy lattice-work around the windows, the
                  pictures that hung upon the walls, till every thing<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000088"/> around her became exalted in Clara's eyes, with
                  charms unknown before. When she arose to depart, she urged Mrs. Stanley so warmly
                  to visit her, and to suffer her to see much of Clara, it was impossible not to
                  believe she was soliciting a favour. She was so lonely, she said—the friends who
                  had accompanied her were returned, and she had nothing but her books and harp for
                  companions. Her harp! Clara was crazy to hear a harp. The very idea carried her at
                  once into the fairy land of romance, of Ossian's heroines and Milton's angels.</p>
               <p>"Is she not the most charming woman you ever saw in your life?" exclaimed Clara,
                  the moment she had left them. "I quite forgot my calico frock and these linen
                  shreds, long before she was gone. Did you ever see any one so polite and
                  condescending? I wonder how she came to select us from all the village, to call
                  upon," and she smiled at the importance it would give them in the eyes of their
                  neighbours.</p>
               <p>"I am not much surprised," said Mrs. Stanley, "as her father and yours were on
                  intimate terms, and it is probable she has taken pains to ascertain his friends.
                  She had just married when Mr. Lee came into the country, and as she went
                  immediately abroad, she never visited the place during her father's life. She
                  married very young, and I think I have heard she was not happy in her union. She
                  certainly does not seem inconsolable at her husband's death."</p>
               <p>"Is she not delightful, Edward?" continued Clara, in a perfect fever of
                  admiration. "Did you ever see such eyes and teeth? and though she is dark, her
                  complexion is so glowing and clear, I don't think she would look as handsome if
                  she were fairer. I wonder if she will marry again?"</p>
               <p>"You wonder at so many things," replied Edward, laughing, "you must live in a
                  perpetual state of astonishment. But I do think, Clara, that Mrs. Clifton is very
                  delightful, and very charming, and graceful, and I hope my dear little rustic
                  sister will try to imitate her graces."</p>
               <p>Edward would never have breathed this unfortunate wish had he anticipated how
                  faithfully poor Clara would have obeyed his injunction.</p>
               <p>The visit was soon returned, and if Clara admired her new friend before, she was
                  now completely fascinated. She "saw the white rising of her hands upon the harp,"
                  and heard the mellow tones of a voice tuned to the sweetest modulation of art. The
                  rich furniture, the superb curtains, the paintings in massy gilt frames, seemed to
                  her unaccustomed eye equal to oriental splendour, and Mrs. Clifton some eastern
                  enchantress, presiding over the scene, with more than magic power. Edward Stanley
                  was passionately fond of music. He had never heard it in such perfection. But
                  there was a charm in Mrs. Clifton's conversation even superior to her music. It
                  was full of spirit, sensibility, enthusiasm, and refinement. Then its perfect
                  adaptedness to all around her! Every one talked better with her than with any one
                  else, and felt, when they quitted her society, that they had never been so
                  agreeable before; confessing,<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6687-00000089"/> at the
                  same time, that they had never met with any one half so pleasing as herself. She
                  certainly did flatter a little; that is, she told very pleasant truths, with a
                  most bewitching smile, and another thing, which, perhaps, was the great secret of
                  her attraction, she seemed completely to forget herself, in her interest for those
                  around her.</p>
               <p>It is very certain Mrs. Stanley's family thought more of their new neighbour that
                  night, than their old ones. Even Edward forgot to dream of the blue eyes of Fanny
                  Morton. His conscience reproached him for the oblivion; and when he saw the
                  unenvying interest with which she listened to Clara's praises of the dashing
                  widow, as she was called by the villagers, he admired the sweetness and simplicity
                  of a character, pure as the untracked snow. He admired, but, for the first time,
                  he felt a want in this sweet character. He had never discovered before, that Fanny
                  was deficient in sensibility, that the shadows of feeling seldom passed over her
                  celestial countenance. He found, too, a dearth of thought and variety in her
                  conversation, of which he had never been sensible before. A pang of
                  self-accusation shot through his heart, as he made these discoveries, and feeling
                  as if he were guilty of injustice, his attentions became still more frequent, and
                  he tried to restrain his restless and wandering thoughts.</p>
               <p>Clara sat one morning in a deep reverie. "Mother," said she, at length, "do you
                  remember that full crim son damask petticoat, grandmother left me as a memento of
                  old times?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Stanley, surprised at the suddenness of the question, "why do
                  you ask?"</p>
               <p>"I was thinking it would make some beautiful window curtains for our parlour. The
                  sun shines in so warm it is really uncomfortable to sit there, and the reflection
                  of red curtains is very beautifying to the complexion."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Clara," cried her brother, "you never discovered how uncomfortable it was,
                  till you saw Mrs. Clifton's fine curiains. You forget the blinds, and the vines,
                  and the rose-bushes. Pray have more reverence for dear grandmother's ancient
                  relics."</p>
               <p>Clara blushed, and was considerably disconcerted, but nevertheless continued her
                  dreams of improvement. Her latent love for show and splendour began to glimmer
                  forth and illuminate many an airy castle she amused herself in building. To
                  imitate Mrs. Clifton was now the end and aim of her existence. She practised her
                  step, her air, her smile, before the looking-glass, in her own chamber, till from
                  a very simple and unaffected girl, she became conspicuously the reverse. She
                  strung every window with Æolian harps, and tried to sing in unison when the wild
                  winds swept the chords—but they disdained the harmony of the human voice, and
                  mocked at her efforts. Edward felt quite distressed at an effect so contrary to
                  his wishes, but he concealed his chagrin under a good-humoured ridicule, which
                  somewhat checked her progress in the<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6687-00000090"/>
                  graces. Once, when they were to accompany Mrs. Clifton in an excursion on
                  horseback, and the lady, arrayed in her suit of forest green, was already waiting
                  their motion, he knew not whether he was most amused or grieved, to see Clara
                  descend in a dress of the same colour, in which the imitation was too obvious and
                  too defective not to border on the ridiculous, with a green veil wreathed around
                  the crown of her bonnet, and suffered to stream back behind, in the form of a
                  feather or plume. Though the affection of her brother would not allow him to wound
                  her feelings, by making her fully aware of her folly, and he chose rather gently
                  to lead her back to true simplicity and good sense, she did not escape a severer
                  lash from those who envied her the distinction of Mrs. Clifton's acquaintance, and
                  who revenged themselves on her damask curtains, Æolian harps, and new-born airs.
                  Her present ambition was to possess a gold chain, an ornament she deemed
                  indispensable to the perfection of a lady's dress. She did not aspire to so
                  magnificent a one as wreathed the graceful neck of Mrs. Clifton, but she thought
                  she would be perfectly happy with one of far inferior value surrounding her own.
                  She had a long string of large gold beads, a parting gift from her sainted
                  grandmother, an ornament too obsolete for wear, and which she had often sighed to
                  convert into modern jewelry. An opportunity occurred, at the very moment, of all
                  others, she most desired it. Mrs. Clifton was to give a party. The day before the
                  event, Clara was examining her simple wardrobe, trying to decide on the important
                  articles of dress, and mourning over her slender stock of finery, when a pedler
                  stopped at the door, with a trunk filled with jewelry and trinkets. He spread them
                  before her admiring eyes, and when she hesitated and regretted—he offered to take
                  any old ornaments in exchange, holding up, at the same time, a glittering chain,
                  the very article for which her vitiated fancy was yearning. The temptation was
                  irresistible, and, unfortunately, she was alone. She flew to her little trunk of
                  treasures, drew out her grandmother's beads, and the pedler's eyes brightened as
                  he saw the pure rich old fashioned gold, knowing their superior value to his own
                  gilded trifles.</p>
               <p>"Will you exchange that chain for these?" said she, in a faltering voice; for in
                  spite of her vain desire, the very act seemed a sacrilege to her conscience.</p>
               <p>"That would not be an even bargain," he replied; and it was true, for the chain
                  was nothing but brass, thinly washed with gold. Clara hung down her head. In
                  proportion to the difficulty of obtaining the bauble, her longing increased.</p>
               <p>"That is a very pretty, little trunk," cried the pedler, "it would be very
                  convenient to hold my jewels. If you will throw that in, we will strike a
                  bargain."</p>
               <p>Now the trunk was not Clara's. It belonged to her brother. It was the last
                  keepsake bequeathed to him by this same grandmother, whose legacies of love Clara
                  was converting to purposes of vanity and pride. There was a letter in it, directed
                  to him, with a clause<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6687-00000091"/> on the envelope,
                  that he was not to open it till he was of age, <emph>unless</emph> he should find
                  himself in some emergency, and especially in need of counsel. The old lady was
                  supposed to possess considerable property, and it was also believed that Edward
                  would be her heir. On her death, however, these expectations proved vain, and her
                  grandson did not honour her memory the less because he was not enriched by her
                  loss. He took the letter as a sacred bequest, wondering much at the singular
                  injunction, and told Clara to keep the trunk for him, as it was of no use to him,
                  and she would preserve it with more care. Clara knew it was only intrusted to her
                  keeping; and she turned pale at the thought of betraying a brother's trust; but
                  she repeated to herself it was of no possible use to him, that he would probably
                  never inquire for it, and it could not hurt her dear grandmother's feelings, who
                  was sleeping beneath the clods of the valley. It was a thing, too, of so little
                  consequence—and the chain was so beautiful. She emptied the trunk of its contents,
                  gave it hastily into the pedler's hands, with the beads which had remained on her
                  grandmother's neck till she died, and gathering up the chain, felt,—instead of the
                  joy of triumph—self-upbraiding and shame. She would have recalled the act; but it
                  was too late—the pedler was gone. So poor was the gratification of vanity—but the
                  bitter consequence of a deviation from rectitude she was yet to experience.</p>
               <p>When arrayed for the party, she put a shawl carefully around her neck before she
                  made her appearance ance, to conceal her ill-gotten splendour—but the
                  consciousness of having something to conceal from the affectionate eyes that were
                  bent upon her, gave a disturbed and anxious expression to her countenance that did
                  not escape the observation of her brother; and when she saw Fanny in the unadorned
                  simplicity of her own loveliness, she secretly loathed the acquisition for which
                  she had sacrificed her principles of right.</p>
               <p>"Let me see you, Clara, before you start," said Mrs. Stanley—and she added,
                  smiling, "I hope you have not tried to look too well."</p>
               <p>"Oh, pray, mother take care, cried Clara, shrinking from the dreaded hand that
                  touched her shawl; "it will tumble my dress to take it off now. It is only my
                  plain muslin frock," and hurrying away, with blushes and trepidation, she felt
                  that her punishment was begun.</p>
               <p>Arrived at Mrs. Clifton's—she became still more dissatisfied, when she saw their
                  elegant hostess, dressed in the simplest attire, consistent with fashion and
                  taste, with no ornament but a cluster of roses, wreathed amidst locks of gypsy
                  blackness and oriental abundance. Her piercing eye rested a moment on the
                  beautiful Fanny, then flashed towards Edward, with a very peculiar expression. He
                  understood their meaning, and an undefinable sensation of pain and displeasure
                  oppressed him. Mrs. Clifton was too polite to confine her attentions to those she
                  most wished to distinguish, but moved amongst her guests, endeavouring, as far as
                  possible, to adapt herself to<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6687-00000092"/> their
                  different capacities and tastes. She had invited her father's friends, wishing
                  extremely to make them her own, and to convince them that she valued their
                  sympathy and good will.</p>
               <p>"You seem dispirited this evening, Mr. Stanley," said she, as Edward, unusually
                  silent, stood leaning against the harp, from which he had more than once heard
                  thrilling music; "perhaps I ought to say, preoccupied. It may be wise to abstract
                  the mind in the midst of a throng, but I am afraid it is rather selfish."</p>
               <p>"I should think the wisdom consisted in the subject of the abstraction," replied
                  Edward, "and I believe I am as unwise as I am selfish."</p>
               <p>"I do not think so," said Mrs. Clifton, and she looked at Fanny, whose serene
                  countenance was beaming from the opposite side of the room. "Beauty, whether the
                  subject of abstraction or contemplation, fills the mind with the most delightful
                  ideas, and elevates it by the conviction that the hand that <emph>made it is
                     divine.</emph> I do not agree with the moralist who would degrade it as a vain
                  and valueless possession. The woman who possesses it, may exercise a boundless
                  influence over the heart of man, and if exerted aright how glorious may be the
                  result!—Often and often have I sighed for the celestial gift—yet, perhaps, I
                  should be neither better nor happier."</p>
               <p>"You!" exclaimed Edward.</p>
               <p>It was but a monosyllable, but the most laboured panegyric could not have been
                  half so expressive. The clear olive of Mrs. Clifton's cheek was coloured with a
                  brighter hue as she languidly resumed—"I did not solicit a compliment, but its
                  brevity recommends yours. I know I am not handsome. I cannot be if beauty depends
                  upon lilies and roses. In the gay and heartless world I have learned to shine as
                  others do, and have tried the rules of art. My life has been passed much with
                  strangers. You, Mr. Stanley, surrounded as you are, by all the sweet charities of
                  a home, living in its warm and sunny atmosphere, you do not know the coldness and
                  the loneliness of the brotherless and sisterless heart."</p>
               <p>She spoke in a tone of deep feeling, and cast down her eyes with a deep expression
                  of profound melancholy. Edward did not attempt to reply—he could not embody the
                  new and over-powering emotions that were filling his soul, and he would not utter
                  the common place language of admiration. He felt like a man who had all his life
                  been walking in darkness, and a dream, and had all at once awakened in a blaze of
                  light. Several now gathered around Mrs. Clifton, entreating her to play; and
                  Edward availed himself of the opportunity of drawing back, where he could listen,
                  unseen by her, to the melodious songstress of the hour. He looked at Fanny, who
                  was now near the instrument, and compared the calm feeling of happiness he had
                  enjoyed in her society to the tumultuous tide that was now rushing through his
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"I have loved Fanny like a brother," thought he,<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000093"/> "ignorant of a deeper passion. And now I am a man
                  and a fool——."</p>
               <p>A hand was laid upon his arm. "Brother, are you not well? You look pale to-night."
                  Clara was looking anxiously in his face, and he saw that her own was flushed with
                  excitement.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Clara, I am well—but what has disturbed you? Indeed I noticed before we left
                  home that something seemed to weigh upon your spirits. Tell me the cause."</p>
               <p>He drew her hand affectionately through his arm, and for the first time noticed
                  her new ornament.</p>
               <p>"It is not the weight of this new chain that oppresses you," said he, lifting it
                  from her neck—"though it does feel rather magnificent. You have never showed me
                  this new gift of yours. Who could have been the donor?"—and he thought of Mrs.
                  Clifton.</p>
               <p>"Do not speak of it here," whispered Clara, with so much embarrassment, it
                  confirmed Edward's suspicions with regard to the donor, and though he regretted
                  the nature of the obligation, he could not but think it was prompted by kindness
                  to an observation of Clara's imitative decorations. The truth was, Clara had been
                  exceedingly annoyed by the questions she could not, or rather would not
                  answer.</p>
               <p>Some one had suggested that it was a present from Mrs. Clifton, and though she did
                  not affirm it, actually, she was glad to admit the idea, as an escape from further
                  persecution on the subject. Still her conscience writhed under the implied
                  falsehood, and she dreaded its detection. To add to her mortification, she
                  overheard some one remark "that Clara Stanley need not put on so many airs about
                  her new chain, for it was nothing but pinchbeck, and had a strong smell of
                  brass."</p>
               <p>She rejoiced when the hour of retiring arrived; and when she reached home, she ran
                  up stairs, went to bed, and cried herself to sleep. Poor Clara! she awakened that
                  night from a terrible fit of the nightmare, for she dreamed that her grandmother's
                  icy hands were groping about her neck for the beads she had bartered, that the
                  cold grasp grew tighter and tighter, her breath shorter and shorter, till she
                  screamed and awoke. She dreaded the next day her brother's questioning about the
                  mysterious chain; but, absorbed in his own deep, overmastering emotions, he forgot
                  the subject when the glittering bauble was removed from before his eyes. From this
                  time a change was observable in his character. He became as silent and abstracted
                  as he had before been gay and communicative. He no longer talked of Mrs. Clifton,
                  and even to Fanny he was cold and constrained. Fanny preserved the same equanimity
                  of feeling, though she missed Edward's vivacity and smiles, and openly lamented
                  the transformation. She looked rather more serious than usual, but the azure of
                  her eye was undimmed, and the soft rose of her cheek remained undiminished in
                  bloom. Edward turned from the sameness and lustre of her countenance, to gaze
                     upon<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6687-00000094"/> the changing face that "pale
                  passion loved"—and while he acknowledged the hopelessness of his infatuation, he
                  brooded over it, till it enervated all the energies of his soul. It was fortunate
                  for his mind, that domestic circumstances of a perplexing nature roused it into
                  exercise. Some very unexpected claims were made against the estate. Mr. Stanley
                  had died suddenly, and left his affairs considerably involved, but his family now
                  believed every thing was settled, and that the small property which remained was
                  all their own. With the strictest economy it was just sufficient for a genteel
                  support, and that was all. They had no means of meeting this unexpected exigency,
                  but by the sale of the house—a sorrowful expedient, for it was endeared by every
                  association connected with a husband's and a father's love—besides it was their
                  home, and where should they look for another? Edward remembered the letter of his
                  grandmother. He wanted but a few months of being of age, and the hour of trouble
                  had arrived. He opened and read it, then gave it into his mother's hands with a
                  countenance illuminated with joy.</p>
               <p>"It is all well, dear mother—more than well—though dead she yet continues her
                  guardianship of love. Clara, where is the trunk whose value I have just learned?
                  It will save us from ruin."</p>
               <p>Clara looked aghast.</p>
               <p>"The trunk!" stammered she—"what good can it do us?"</p>
               <p>"Read that letter—it will explain it."</p>
               <p>The explanation may be given to the reader in fewer words. The trunk contained a
                  false bottom, in which the good lady had placed deeds and papers, containing an
                  amount of property which made a rich legacy to her grandson. Knowing the
                  temptations to which youth is exposed, and knowing too that necessity calls forth
                  the noblest powers of mankind; she did not wish him to know of the existence of
                  this property till he became of age; and being somewhat eccentric in her
                  character, and fond of surprises, she had adopted this singular method of
                  bequeathing to him her fortune. Clara read the letter, and sat like a statue of
                  stone. She wished the earth to open and swallow her, the mountains to fall and
                  crush her to atoms, to save her from the remorse and shame that had overtaken
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Clara, what is the matter?" said Edward, sitting down by her side; "can you not
                  go for the trunk, Clara?"</p>
               <p>The unhappy girl tried to speak, but only uttered a piercing shriek, and fell
                  prostrate on the floor—Excessively alarmed, they raised and endeavoured to bring
                  her to composure, but she continued to wring her hands and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Oh, what have I done! what have I done!"</p>
               <p>They gathered at length from her broken sentences, the extent of their misfortune.
                  The treasure was lost, irredeemably lost, for it would be impossible to trace the
                  course of one who led an itinerant life, and was probably now in some remote
                     part<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6687-00000095"/> of the country. If it ever were
                  discovered, it would probably be at some distant day, and the demand was immediate
                  and pressing. Neither Mrs. Stanley nor Edward could add to the agonies of Clara's
                  remorse, by unavailing reproaches, but they both keenly felt how much it added to
                  their calamity, to think the means their guardian angel held out for their relief,
                  was wrested from them by the hands of a daughter and a sister.</p>
               <p>"We must submit," said Mrs. Stanley, with a heavy sigh, "to the will of God."</p>
               <p>"We must <emph>act,</emph>" said Edward, "and be not cast down, my mother. If
                  Heaven spares my life and health, we shall never know one real want. In this
                  country there is no such thing as <emph>poverty,</emph> and as to vanity and show,
                  let Clara's bitter lesson prove the emptiness of their claims."</p>
               <p>When it was known that Mrs. Stanley's dwelling-house was advertised for sale, to
                  satisfy the demands of impatient creditors, there was much astonishment and
                  sorrow, for she was a woman universally beloved for her meekness, loving kindness,
                  and tender charities. The neighbours gathered in to question and condole, and
                  great was the sympathy expressed for Clara's inconsolable grief. They did not know
                  the secret burden that weighed her to the dust, and wondered much to see the young
                  bowed down so heavily, while Mrs. Stanley seemed so calm and resigned. Fanny
                  Morton was very sorry, and expressed herself on the occasion with all the depth of
                  feeling of which her tranquil nature was capable, but Edward more than ever felt
                  the immeasurable distance of their souls. Hers could not comprehend the depth and
                  sensibility of his. The lightning of heaven, and the cold phosphorescent light of
                  earth are not more different in their properties. Mrs. Clifton came, but not with
                  the crowd. She waited till others accused her of standing aloof from her
                  favourites in the day of adversity. She came alone, leaving her carriage, her
                  servants, and all the paraphernalia of her wealth behind her. Mrs. Stanley knew
                  how to appreciate this delicacy, as well as the added deference and respect of her
                  manners. She asked no questions—she added no condolence—she came, she said, to
                  solicit a favour, not to confer one. She wished to become purchaser of their
                  beautiful cottage, whose situation she had so much admired. She had learned that
                  her father had desired to become the owner of the lot, if Mr. Stanley ever
                  disposed of it. She was anxious herself that it should not pass into other hands,
                  and to secure their continuance in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>"If by gratifying my father's known wish," continued Mrs. Clifton, her brilliant
                  eyes softened by visible emotion, "I can relieve you, Mrs. Stanley, from, I trust,
                  a transient embarrassment, I shall not consider myself less your debtor—when the
                  time comes that you desire to reclaim it, I will not withhold its
                  restoration."</p>
               <p>The tears, which sorrow had not wrung from Mrs. Stanley's eyes, now fell fast from
                  gratitude. She pressed Mrs. Clifton's hand in hers, and said, in a low<pb
                     n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6687-00000096"/> voice, "You have caused the widow's
                  heart to sing for joy—may heaven reward you for your kindness."</p>
               <p>Clara, incapable of restraining herself longer, threw her arms around her neck,
                  and sobbed out, "Oh, madam, you have saved me from despair."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clifton, who attributed her words to the natural regret of a young and ardent
                  heart, on the prospect of quitting the home of childhood, warmly returned the
                  involuntary embrace, and bid her call back her smiles, and be ready to accompany
                  her on the morrow in a botanical excursion. When she rose to depart, Edward rose
                  also to accompany her home. He was no longer gloomy and reserved. He no longer
                  looked upon her as an enchantress, moving high above him, in a region of
                  inaccessible light and splendour, but as a woman, endowed with all the warm and
                  lovely sensibilities of her sex—a being whom he might dare to love, though he
                  could never hope to obtain—who might forgive the homage, even though she rejected
                  the worshipper. Had not humility, always the accompaniment of deep and fervent
                  passion, ruled his perceptions, he might have derived an inspiration for his
                  hopes, from the softened language of her eyes—a language which others had not been
                  slow in translating. They entered the magnificent saloon. The contrast its gilded
                  walls presented to the agitated scene they had left, was felt by both.</p>
               <p>"Desolate is the dwelling of Moina," said she, in an accent half sad and half
                  sportive,—"silence is in the house of her fathers."</p>
               <p>"Dwells there no joy in song, white hand of the harp of Lutha?" continued Edward,
                  in the same poetic language, and drawing the harp towards her. It is always
                  delightful to find the train of our own thoughts pursued by a friend—proving that
                  we think in unison. Mrs. Clifton felt this as she swept her hands over the chords,
                  and called forth that sweet and impassioned melody peculiar to the daughters of
                  Italy. She paused, and her dark eye rested a moment on the face of her auditor. It
                  was partly shaded by his hand, and she saw that he was overcome by some powerful
                  emotion. Again she sang, but her voice was low, and she ceased at length as if
                  weary of the effort.</p>
               <p>"You seem spell-bound by the genius of silence," said she; "I should be wrong to
                  break the charm."</p>
               <p>"I know I must appear more than stupid," replied he, "when there is every thing
                  around to inspire me. But my feelings have been deeply oppressed by anxiety, and
                  the weight of anxiety has been removed by a debt of gratitude, which, however
                  pleasing and gracefully imposed, is only too deeply felt."</p>
               <p>"Oh! let not your pride be jealous of the happiness I have dared this day to
                  purchase. What have I done for you and yours, half—half so precious to YOUR
                  remembrance, as to <emph>mine?</emph> Your sister's tearful blessing, your
                  mother's hallowed prayer."</p>
               <p>She spoke with fervor and sensibility, and her countenance was lighted up with
                  such an exalted expression, Edward was scarcely able to restrain the impetuous
                  impulses of passion that urged him on. The confession trembled on his lips, but
                  pride and<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6687-00000097"/> poverty, two stern monitors,
                  stood by his side, and forbade the avowal of his madness and presumption.</p>
               <p>"No!" said he to himself, "let me live on in the silence and secrecy of hopeless
                  devotion, rather than by unguarded rashness risk the loss of that confidence so
                  dangerous, yet so delightful. She allows me to be her friend. Let me never dare to
                  aspire to more."</p>
               <p>Thus reasoned Edward Stanley, and thus he schooled the language of his lips—but
                  the passion denied utterance in words, flashed from his eyes, and modulated every
                  accent of his voice. He looked back upon this evening, passed alone with Mrs.
                  Clifton, amidst the breathings of poetry and music, and exulted in the reflection
                  that he had not committed himself by any act of imprudence he might hereafter
                  vainly rue. Sometimes his feelings rose up against Clara, for the selfish vanity
                  that had led her to sacrifice the fortune that might have placed him above the
                  suspicion of mercenary motives, but her unappeasable sorrow for her transgression,
                  would not allow him to cherish any resentment towards her. Sometimes too, his
                  conscience reproached him for the part he was acting towards Fanny, the idol of
                  his boyish fancy—but every hour passed in her presence, convinced him that she
                  looked upon him more as a brother than a lover, and wrapped in a mantle of
                  constitutional indifference, she seemed scarcely aware of the wandering of his
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I am so glad vou are not going to leave us! I do not know how I should live
                  without you and Clara."</p>
               <p>Fanny's most ardent expression in joy and sorrow, was, "I am so glad—I am so
                  sorry." It was a great deal for her to say—but she looked at Clara exactly as she
                  did at him, and Edward, whose heart was now enlightened, felt that she did not
                  love him, and he rejoiced in the conviction.</p>
               <p>One evening, just between twilight and darker hour, he was returning from a long
                  walk, when, a little before he left the woodland path that led into the public
                  road, he met an old woman muffled in a cloak and hood—he bowed, and was passing
                  on, when she accosted him in a voice that was not unknown, and approaching nearer
                  to her, he knew by the spectacles gleaming through the shades, under the deeper
                  shade of a mob-cap, his ancient friend of the stage-coach, and he greeted her with
                  great cordiality. She told him she was travelling about as usual, and had stopped
                  in the village to make a visit to Mrs. Clifton, the granddaughter of her old
                  friend.</p>
               <p>"It is growing dark and late," said he, "let me see you safe to her house, for you
                  have mistaken the path that leads to it."</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment," cried she, "if you are not in too much haste, and let me rest on
                  this log by the wayside. I am old, and it wearies me to walk fast. Sit down, young
                  man, and let me ask after your welfare. I have not forgotten your kindness to the
                  aged, nor ever shall I."</p>
               <p>Edward brushed the dust from the log with his<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000098"/> handkerchief, and preparing a seat for her, with
                  great reverence placed himself at her side.</p>
               <p>"Come," said she, "I must soon be gone, but I want to know if I can serve you. I
                  am an eccentric old creature, but I am well off in the world, and when I die, I
                  cannot carry my money into the grave. I am told there is a pretty young girl in
                  the neighbourhood, whom you love, and would marry, were you not poor. Do not blush
                  to own it, for if it is so, and I can make you happy by my means, I shall bless
                  the hour that brought us together, even near the end of my pilgrimage."</p>
               <p>Her tremulous voice faltered, and she raised her handkerchief under her
                  spectacles.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, a thousand times, for your generous offer," replied Edward, much
                  moved; "but indeed, madam, you are misinformed. I would not marry, if I
                  could."</p>
               <p>"Young man," cried she, "you are not sincere. The heart craves for a kindred
                  heart. You would not live alone. Confide in me, and I will not betray you. Trifle
                  with me, and you may lose a friend, whose professions are not lightly made. Tell
                  me, do you not love the fair girl, whom they call the beauty of the village, or is
                  it but a passing rumour that has reached my ears?"</p>
               <p>Edward wondered at the interest this singular old woman expressed in his destiny,
                  but he did not doubt its sincerity, and he would not repay it with
                  dissimulation.</p>
               <p>"No, madam, I do not love her, otherwise than with brotherly kindness. Where I
                     <emph>do</emph> love, I cannot hope, and all your generosity cannot avail me
                  there."</p>
               <p>"Where?" said she. "I want no half confidences The imagination of age is dull to
                  that of youth. Tell me all, or nothing."</p>
               <p>"There is one, then, with whom, were she poor, beggary would be a paradise, but
                  whom fortune has placed so far beyond my reach, it would be madness to name, and
                  presumption to aspire to. Sometimes, emboldened by her condescension, I have dared
                  to think, had my lot been different—but no—it can never be—I need not say more—you
                  know where your steps are bound."</p>
               <p>A silence followed this avowal, and Edward was so much absorbed by his own
                  feelings, as almost to forget the presence of his companion. At length she
                  spoke.</p>
               <p>"I do not see the great presumption of your hopes if you mean the Widow Clifton. I
                  see nothing to make her beyond your reach, unless you choose yourself to put her
                  up in the clouds. She is rich, it is true, but what does she want in another? She
                  has found no joy in wealth. I know the history of her marriage; it was involuntary
                  on her part, and brought no happiness—a state of splendid bondage. Why do you not
                  at least learn from her, whether your love is hopeless? If I, an old woman—if my
                  heart warmed towards you, the first moment I saw you,—is her young bosom made of
                  stone, that it cannot be melted or impressed?"</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6687-00000099"/>
               <p>"She has often spoken," said Edward, finding an increasing fascination in the
                  subject, and drawing still nearer his aged friend, "of the loneliness of her
                  destiny, and of the insufficiency of wealth, to satisfy the cravings of the heart.
                  Then wild dreams dazzled my imagination, and gilt the future with the hues of
                  heaven. But the dread of being banished from her presence, of incurring the
                  displeasure of one who had been the benefactress of our family—you, who are now in
                  the winter of your days, can have no conception of the strength of these mental
                  conflicts—this warring of fire and ice."</p>
               <p>"I have not forgotten the memories of youth," she answered; "and impassive as you
                  believe me, there is an image cherished in my breast, whose traits the waves of
                  oblivion can never efface, nor the snow of age ever chill. Few can love as I have
                  loved; and love with me, is immortal as the divine spark that lights up this
                  perishing frame."</p>
               <p>She leaned tremblingly against the shoulder of Edward, who reproached himself for
                  calling up emotions so sublime in their strength, thus glowing and triumphant,
                  amidst the ruins of beauty and youth. He drew her cloak more closely around her,
                  and warned her that the night dew was falling.</p>
               <p>"You are right," said she, rising; "I was forgetting I am not young like you."</p>
               <p>They walked slowly on, in the direction of Mrs. Clifton's house.</p>
               <p>"May I not ask the name of the friend, to whose kindness I am so much indebted?"
                  cried he.</p>
               <p>"Oh," replied she, laughing, "I thought every body knew Aunt Bridget; for I am one
                  of those universal aunts, whom every body knows, and nobody cares for. My property
                  is my own, and I have a right to bequeath it to whomsoever I please. I have chosen
                  you as my heir, and you may consider yourself equal in fortune to Widow Clifton,
                  or any other widow in the land. Not a word of thanks—no gratitude—at least till
                  legal measures are taken to secure it to your possession."</p>
               <p>"Singular and generous being!" said Edward; beginning to believe her brain was
                  somewhat unsound, "what have I done to excite so romantic an interest, what can I
                  do to prove myself worthy of it?"</p>
               <p>"Be sincere—truth is the only bond of love, and concealment with friends is
                  falsehood."</p>
               <p>They had now reached the gate of the avenue.</p>
               <p>"You will go in?"</p>
               <p>"No," said he, "I cannot see her to-night; to-morrow, perhaps—shall I see you
                  then?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell what the morrow will bring forth. But one thing let me say, young
                  man, ere we part. You must plead your own cause, and not expect it will be done by
                  me. If you have not moral courage and manly spirit sufficient to meet the
                  consequences, whatever they may be, you merit the downfall of your hope, and the
                  humiliation of your pride."</p>
               <p>She closed the gate, and Edward watched her dark shrouded figure slowly treading
                  the winding path, and almost imagined he had been with one of those sibylline
                  priestesses, who opened their lips in prophecy<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000100"/> phecy, and shadowed the mystic outlines of
                  futurity. "Whatever she may be," thought he, "I will be guided by her counsel, and
                  abide by the result."</p>
               <p>As he drew near his own home, and saw the light shining so quietly and brightly
                  through the trees that quivered gently as in a golden shower, and thought how
                  tranquilly the hearts of the inmates now beat, secure from the fear of being
                  driven from that love-hallowed home—when he reflected that for this peace, so
                  beautifully imagined in the scene before him, they were indebted to the very being
                  whose recollection excited the throbbing of a thousand pulses in his heart and in
                  his brain,—gratitude so mingled with and chastened his love, that every breathing
                  became a prayer for her happiness, even if it were to be purchased at the
                  sacrifice of his own.</p>
               <p>He saw Clara through the window, seated at a table, with some object before her,
                  which was shaded by the branches, but her attitude was so expressive that he stood
                  a moment to contemplate her figure. Her hands were clasped in a kind of ecstacy,
                  and her cheeks were coloured with a bright crimson, strikingly contrasting with
                  their late pallid hue. Something hung glittering from her fingers, upon which she
                  gazed rapturously one moment,—then, bending forward the next, she seemed intent
                  upon what was before her. He opened the door softly; she sprang up, and, throwing
                  her arms around him, cried in an accent of hysterical joy—</p>
               <p>"Dear brother—the trunk is found—there it is, oh! I am <emph>so</emph> hoppy!" And
                  she wept and laughed alternately.</p>
               <p>There indeed it was—the identical trunk—whose loss had occasioned so much
                  sorrow,—with its red morocco covering and bright nails untarnished. Edward
                  rejoiced more for Clara's sake than his own—for her remorse, though salutary to
                  herself, was harrowing to him.</p>
               <p>"Explain this mystery, dear Clara, and moderate these transports. How have you
                  recovered the lost treasure?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! it was the strangest circumstance! Who do you think had it, but Mrs. Clifton,
                  that angel sent down from heaven, for our especial blessing."</p>
               <p>"You know I went there to-day, about the time you took the walk in the woods. My
                  heart was so full of grief for my folly, and gratitude for her kindness, I thought
                  it would have burst, and I told her all; no, not quite all—for I could not bring
                  myself to tell her that it contained your property; her eye seemed to upbraid me
                  so for betraying the trust; but again it beamed with joy because she could restore
                  to me both sacred relics."</p>
               <p>Here she held up the beads, now a thousand times more precious to her than all the
                  chains in the world.</p>
               <p>"The pedler called there, after he left me. She recognized the trunk, as it bore
                  the name of a friend."</p>
               <p>Edward's cheek burned with emotion—for his own name, Edward Stanley, was wrought
                  upon the velvet lining, but Clara went breathlessly on.</p>
               <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6687-00000101"/>
               <p>"She gathered from the pedler the history of the beads, and purchased them both,
                  that she might, on some future day, have the pleasure of restoring them. She
                  understood the sacrifice my foolish vanity had made, and anticipated the
                  repentance that would follow. Is she not a friend, the best and kindest, and ought
                  we not to love her as our own souls? And can you forgive me, Edward—will you
                  forgive me, though I fear I never shall be able to pardon myself?"</p>
               <p>"Forgive you, my sister? Let me only see once more the sweet, unaffected girl, who
                  was the object of my approbation, as well as my love, and I ask no more."</p>
               <p>He now examined the secret recess of the trunk, and found the papers safe and
                  untouched. Their value transcended his most sanguine expectations. He could redeem
                  the paternal dwelling, meet the demands which had involved them in distress, and
                  still find himself a comparatively rich man.</p>
               <p>Clara ran out of the room, and, bringing back the chain—the "cause of all her
                  woe,"—she put it in a conspicuous corner of her work-box.</p>
               <p>"I will never wear this paltry bauble again," cried she; "but I will keep it as a
                  memento of my vanity, and a pledge of my reformation. I will look at it a few
                  moments every day, as the lady did upon the skeleton of her lover, to remind me of
                  the sins of mortality."</p>
               <p>When Clara had left them with a joyous "good night," Mrs. Stanley drew her chair
                  next to her son, and looked earnestly in his face.</p>
               <p>"There is something I ought to mention," said she, "and yet I cannot bear to damp
                  your present satisfaction. I have been told of an intended marriage, which I fear
                  will disappoint your fondest hopes. I trust, however, you have too much honest
                  pride to suffer your feelings to prey upon your happiness."</p>
               <p>Edward started up, and pushed his chair against the wall with a violent
                  rebound.</p>
               <p>"I cannot bear it, mother—I believe it would drive me mad after all I have dared
                  to dream to-night. I might, perhaps, live without her, but I could not live to see
                  her married to another. Fool, credulous fool that I was, to believe that dotard's
                  prophecy!"</p>
               <p>He sat down again in the chair which Clara had left, and, throwing his arms across
                  the table, bent his face over them, and remained silent.</p>
               <p>"Alas! my son," cried Mrs. Stanley, "I feared it would be so. Mr. Morton feels for
                  you the tenderness of a father, but——"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Morton, did you say?" cried Edward, starting up again, at the risk of
                  upsetting chairs, tables, and lamps,—"I believe I am out of my senses; and is it
                  Fanny Morton who is going to be married?"</p>
               <p>The sudden change in his countenance, from despair to composure, quite electrified
                  Mrs. Stanley. She could not comprehend such great and sudden self-control.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Morton tells me," she continued, "that Fanny is addressed by a gentleman of
                  wealth and respectability, and one who is every way a desirable connection. He has
                  learned from Fanny that no engagement<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6687-00000102"/>
                  ment subsisted between you; but he seemed apprehensive that your affections were
                  deeply interested, and wished me to soften the intelligence as much as
                  possible."</p>
               <p>Edward smiled. "Tell Mr. Morton I thank him for his kind consideration, for no one
                  can rejoice in Fanny's prospects more than I do."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stanley was bewildered, for she had not dreamed of his present
                  infatuation.</p>
               <p>"I cannot understand how resignation can be acquired so soon, especially after
                  such a burst of frenzy. I fear it is merely assumed to spare my feelings."</p>
               <p>"I cannot feign, dear mother, though I may conceal. Dismiss all fears upon this
                  subject, for were Fanny to live a thousand years in all her virgin loveliness—if
                  nature permitted such a reign to youth and beauty—she would never be sought after
                  as the bride of your son."</p>
               <p>He kissed his mother, and bade her a hasty "good night," anxious to avoid
                  explanation on a subject which had already agitated him so much.</p>
               <p>The next day, when he reflected on his extraordinary interview with the old lady
                  of the stagecoach, and her incredible promise in his behalf, he became more than
                  ever convinced of her mental hallucination. Yet there was too much method in her
                  madness, if madness indeed existed, to allow him to slight the impressions of her
                  words.—He was now independent, and hopes that before seemed presumptuous, now
                  warmed every pulsation of his being.</p>
               <p>"Shall I even now follow the sibyl's counsel?" said he to himself, as he bent his
                  steps at evening towards Mrs. Clifton's door; but the moment he entered her
                  presence, Aunt Bridget, her promises, and the world itself were forgotten. She met
                  him with a smile, but there was a burning glow on her cheek, and a hurried glance
                  of her eye, that indicated internal agitation. She attempted to converse on
                  indifferent topics, but her thoughts seemed to wander, and she at length became
                  silent.</p>
               <p>"I saw a friend of yours last night," said he with much embarrassment, for he knew
                  not whether his confessions were unrevealed. "She is very singular, but extremely
                  interesting in her eccentricities. Is she with you yet?"</p>
               <p>"She is, and will be with us whenever you desire. Yet I would first speak with
                  you, Mr. Stanley, and communicate an intelligence which I trust will not cost me
                  the withdrawal of your friendship. You have known me rich, surrounded with all the
                  appliance of wealth and fashion, and, as such, envied and admired. My fortune has
                  been transferred into the hands of another, and you see me now destitute of that
                  tinsel glare, which threw a radiance around me, which was not my own. Flatterers
                  may desert me, but friends—I trust I may retain."</p>
               <p>She extended her hand with an involuntary motion, and the glow forsook her
                  cheek.</p>
               <p>"Your fortune gone," exclaimed Edward, "and mine restored!" The next moment he was
                  kneeling at her feet. In no other attitude could he have expressed<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000103"/> pressed the depth of passion he now dared to utter.
                  What he said he knew not; he only felt that he was breathing forth the hoarded and
                  late hopeless love, of whose extent he had never before been fully conscious.</p>
               <p>"Am I then loved for myself alone?" cried Mrs. Clifton; "by one, too, from whom I
                  have vainly waited this avowal, to justify my preference?"</p>
               <p>She bowed her head upon the hands that Edward was clasping in his own, as if her
                  soul shared the humility of his devotion. Who would have recognized the gay and
                  brilliant heiress, who once revelled in the cold halls of fashion, in this tender
                  and passionate woman?</p>
               <p>"Oh!" exclaimed she, when the feelings of both became sufficiently calm for
                  explanation, "were I still the child of affluence, I might have vainly looked for
                  the testimony of that love which the vassal of love was so long a rebel to, to
                  truth, and to nature. And now," added she, rising, "let me not, in the fulness of
                  my heart's content, forget your old friend, who is waiting no doubt, with
                  impatience, to greet you. You will probably be surprised to learn that she is the
                  lawful inheritor of my fortune, and that all I have been so profusely lavishing
                  was her just due."</p>
               <p>She smiled at Edward's unutterable look of astonishment, and closed the door. He
                  was left but a few moments to his own bewildered thoughts, when the door again
                  opened, and Aunt Bridget entered, in the same ancient cloak and hood, which seemed
                  to be a part of herself.</p>
               <p>"Wisest and best of counsellors," said he, advancing to meet her, and leading her
                  to a seat on the sofa—"to you I owe the blessings of this hour. It was surely a
                  propitious star that shone upon me when I first seated myself beside you that
                  memorable night. Had you not come to prove your claim to her wealth, the spell
                  that bound me would not yet have been broken, and a wall of separation might still
                  have arisen between hearts that have met and blended, and will continue to mingle
                  through eternity."</p>
               <p>Aunt Bridget turned away her head, and seemed suddenly to have lost the gift of
                  speech.</p>
               <p>Somewhat alarmed at her unusual silence, especially as he felt her shaking and
                  trembling under the folds of her cloak, he leaned over, and tried to untie her
                  hood, so as to give her air. Fearing she would fall into a fit, as she continued
                  to tremble still more violently, he burst the ribbons asunder, for the knots
                  seemed to tighten under his fingers, and the cloak, hood, and mob cap fell off
                  simultaneously; the large green spectacles, too, dropped from the eyes, which,
                  laughing and brilliant, now flashed upon his own—and the arms which had been
                  extended to support a far different personage, were folded in transport around the
                  graceful form of Mrs. Clifton.</p>
               <p>"Will you forgive me?" cried she, when she raised those beaming eyes from his
                  shoulder, "the wily deception I have practised? Will you forgive me for continuing
                  a disguise through love which commenced from eccentric motives? Young and
                  unprotected, I have sometimes found safety in this disfiguring garb.<pb

                  wished to learn. Promise not to love me less because the doom of riches still

               <head>The Pedler. The Sequel to the Mob Cap.</head>
               <p>CLARA STANLEY, at the time of her brother's marriage with Mrs. Clifton, believed
                  herself the happiest of human beings. The first wish of her heart was gratified,
                  and she did not think it possible that a more ardent one could quicken its
                  pulsations. She loved Edward as a most affectionate and tender brother; she
                  admired him, too, as the most handsome and graceful of men, and her pride as well
                  as her affection exulted in his union with the admired and fascinating widow. But
                  after the excitement attending the event had subsided, she wondered at the
                  dejection that weighed down her spirits. She felt that there was a love dearer
                  than that of a sister's now gladdening his life, and that she must henceforth be
                  satisfied with a secondary place in his affections. She had no other brother, no
                  sister to supply his place as a companion, and poor Clara was often left to feel a
                  dearth of which she had never dreamed before. There was something, too, in the
                  impassioned character of Gertrude (for thus by her Christian name we will
                  hereafter designate our former friend of the Mob Cap) that threw a kind of romance
                  over every scene in which she moved, and Clara, communing with her own heart,
                  would sometimes ask herself if she had the same deep capabilities of loving, or if
                  the being existed, though yet unseen, who could call them into existence.</p>
               <p>An event soon occurred that gave a new colour to her dreams. She was sitting at an
                  open window, intently reading, when the unfolding of the gate attracted her
                  attention. She started as if she had seen a monster, for she knew at the first
                  glance that it was a pedler who was coming in, and the sight of one filled her
                  with horror. To make the sudden appearance more terrific, he carried in his hand a
                  red morocco trunk, almost exactly like the one she had so shamefully bartered, and
                  unexpectedly recovered.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother, dear mother!" exclaimed she, starting up in dismay, "do not let him
                  come in; I cannot bear the sight of him. Tell him we do not want any jewels. I
                  hate—I detest the whole tribe of pedlers. I wish——"</p>
               <p>A look from her mother checked her rash speech.</p>
               <p>"Rather blame yourself, Clara," said Mrs. Stanley, "for a folly for which I never
                  would again upbraid you, if the remembrance of it did not make you unreasonable
                  and unjust to others. I do not wish you to purchase jewels, but you must not be
                  harsh in your refusal."</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6687-00000105"/>
               <p>"I know I am wrong," answered Clara, ingenuously; "but you know not the agonies of
                  remorse the sight of that man calls to my recollection."</p>
               <p>In the mean while the pedler knocked, and was admitted by Mrs. Stanley, with her
                  usual gentle courtesy. He was a young man of quite a genteel appearance, and his
                  long dark hair shading his forehead with its shining masses, his exceedingly dark
                  complexion, and dark piercing eyes, reminded Clara, whose imagination was ever on
                  the wing in search of romantic resemblances of the Gipsy race. He placed his trunk
                  on the floor, and kneeling on one knee, opened it without speaking.</p>
               <p>"Do not trouble yourself," said Clara, with a nervous shudder, as the opening lid
                  displayed the glitter of the jewels; we do not wish to purchase any thing."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to show them to you," said he, with that officious politeness peculiar
                  to his profession, "you may be tempted to change your resolution."</p>
               <p>"No, no," answered Clara; "I have made a vow never to wear another jewel."</p>
               <p>"Not even a ring?" said he, with a smile, which she thought very bold and
                  sarcastic; and determined to repel his assurance, she took up the book which she
                  was reading, appeared to be absorbed by its contents.</p>
               <p>But the persevering pedler was not so easily repulsed.</p>
               <p>"Will you not look at this beautiful chain?" said he, holding one up so near her
                  eyes that she could not but perceive the dazzle of the links.</p>
               <p>"Surely," thought Clara, "he must be my evil genius, sent to torment me before my
                  time, for my past offence."</p>
               <p>She put the chain back with an impatient gesture, and an appealing look to her
                  mother to rid her of his importunity.</p>
               <p>"My daughter has not the wish, nor I the means, to purchase your ornaments," said
                  Mrs. Stanley mildly, but gravely; "you will probably find others in the
                  neighbourhood, who have both."</p>
               <p>The young pedler reluctantly closed his trunk and took up his hat, which he had
                  thrown at Clara's feet as he knelt, and thus given the opportunity of seeing the
                  the name of Rover written on the lining. He observed the direction of her eyes,
                  and said as he swung the hat carelessly in his hand,</p>
               <p>"A very appropriate name, Miss, for one of my profession. I believe it was what
                  made me first think of becoming a pedler; and, as I am naturally indolent and fond
                  of variety, I find my roving life vastly agreeable at times."</p>
               <p>"You are certainly vastly impertinent," thought Clara, as he retreated with a
                  really graceful bow and a bold gaze of admiration, which displeased Mrs. Stanley
                  very much, and made her close the door quickly after him, though it was a warm
                  summer day.</p>
               <p>"I do not like that man at all, Clara," said she, after he was gone; "he is very
                  assuming, and though I reproved you for your vehemence when he first made his
                  appearance, I cannot but agree with you in thinking that pedlers are any thing but
                  a respectable class of people. A young, handsome, and apparently<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000106"/> rently intelligent man, like him, to be wasting his
                  time in such an idle, inglorious profession. You were right in checking his
                  presumption as you did."</p>
               <p>The next day Clara was searching her work-basket for some stray articles of
                  sewing, when her eyes fell on a small packet, folded up in muslin paper.</p>
               <p>"I do not remember what I have folded so carefully in this envelope," said she, as
                  she loosened the covering, and a beautiful diamond ring, set in pearl, dropped
                  into her lap. Clara was lost in astonishment, and examined it again and again,
                  almost believing it an optical illusion. "How could it get here?" asked she aloud;
                  but she was alone, and all the answer she could obtain was from her own thoughts.
                  "The pedler? Yes, it must have been the pedler!" She remembered that he had taken
                  out some of his jewels, and placed them on the table, and that when he put them
                  back, she had heard some paper rustling in his hands. This could not have been the
                  result of accident,—it must have been a bold design,—and Clara blushed as if she
                  had been detected in the act of stealing; recalling his long, lingering gaze of
                  admiration, and the bright, dark eyes which, in spite of herself, had riveted that
                  gaze on her memory.</p>
               <p>She could not return the ring—she could not keep it; what should she do? She put
                  it on her finger, turned it in the sunbeams, and admired its shifting lustre, and
                  delicate setting. That it was intended as a token of the admiration his looks so
                  evidently expressed, she could not doubt; and, though she knew she ought to be
                  indignant at the presumption of the act, a throb of gratified vanity fluttered in
                  her heart.</p>
               <p>The sound of approaching footsteps induced her to restore the ring to the
                  envelope, and when her mother entered, she was busily searching her work-box for
                  her thimble and scissors, and looking in every direction to avoid the glance that
                  might notice the confusion of her own. Shame prevented her from mentioning the
                  circumstance to her mother,—besides, she did not wish to expose the young pedler
                  to her resentment for his secret homage.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what I have done with my ring!" said she, stooping down that her
                  heightened colour might seem the result of the attitude.</p>
               <p>"Your ring!" repeated Mrs. Stanley—"what ring?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I did not mean ring," cried Clara hastily; "I meant my thimble. But it is too
                  warm to be confined to the needle within doors. I scarcely ever think of walking
                  now,—Edward is not with me."</p>
               <p>"It is true, dear Clara," answered Mrs. Stanley, "you must feel the want of
                  exercise. But you should not linger at home, for want of your brother; for you
                  must learn to be more independent of him now. The paths are all familliar to you,
                  and in our quiet village you can never be in danger."</p>
               <p>Clara felt as if she could bless her mother, for thus giving her a <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">carte-blanche</foreign> to ramble about by herself, and just now
                  she wanted to think her own thoughts, and her own thoughts were never half so
                  delightful as when she could look up to the blue sky, stretching far around her,
                  and the green earth beneath her, the lulling<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000107"/> ing sound of waters in her ear, and the fragrant
                  breathings of the zephyrs on her brow.</p>
               <p>"I will first go to Gertrude," said she to herself, "and, if I find her alone, I
                  will tell her about the ring, and ask her what I must do."</p>
               <p>Gertrude met her at the entrance of the avenue, with one of her most brilliant
                  smiles.</p>
               <p>"You are the very person I most wished to see," said she. "I have just received a
                  letter from that chivalric cousin of mine, Washington Graham, of whom you have
                  more than once heard me speak. He is actualy wending his way hither, so much
                  charmed is he by the description I have given him of a certain rural maiden, whom,
                  perchance, you know. Hear what he says himself, Clara."</p>
               <p>Clara blushed, while Gertrude opened the letter, and read here and there a
                  paragraph:—</p>
               <p>"A cheek to blush, an eye to weep, a heart to feel, and a mind to kindle—these are
                  charms that exercise an almost omnipotent sway over my wayward spirit. Simplicity
                  and sensibility constitute what is most lovely in woman. When these are combined,
                  as they seem to be in this charming new sister of yours, I feel as if I could make
                  a pilgrimage to her shrine, and glory in surrendering a liberty of which so many
                  have vainly attempted to deprive me."</p>
               <p>"Oh, how could you be so unjust to yourself and me?" exclaimed Clara, ready to cry
                  with unaffected vexation. "You know I am the veriest rustic in the world. Even in
                  Edward's company I fear to disgrace him, and how must I appear in a stranger's
                  eyes? I would not meet him for the universe after such a——"</p>
               <p>Clara hesitated. She did not like to accuse Gertrude of falsehood, especially when
                  too partial kindness had dictated the act. Gertrude passed her hand over Clara's
                  throbbing neck, and looked smilingly into her downcast eyes.</p>
               <p>"The sister of Edward Stanley need not blush in the presence of any gentleman of
                  the land,—never at least for her own sake—and do not destroy the fair web of
                  romance I am weaving for you, by false pride or false shame. This cousin of mine
                  is doomed to be the hero of your destiny, graced as he is with every quality to
                  win and wear a maiden's heart. Since I have robbed you of a brother, dear Clara,
                  it is no more than fair that I should give you a lover in return."</p>
               <p>In vain Clara protested and declared she never thought of a lover, never wished
                  for one, and entreated her never to mention the subject; she could never more hear
                  the name of Washington Graham, without feeling her cheeks dyed with conscious
                  blushes.</p>
               <p>"I dare not speak of the ring," thought she, "to Gertrude now. If she has such
                  magnificent views for me, she will be doubtless displeased at the presumption of
                  the gift."</p>
               <p>With her thoughts strangely confused between the blending images of Washington
                  Graham and the pedler, she turned towards the woodland, and continued her walk
                  alone. There was one favourite spot where the turf seemed greener, the sky bluer,
                  and the trees bent their branches more lovingly towards those<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000108"/> who sought the shadow of their leaves than any
                  other, and thither Clara directed her steps. She had concealed the ring in her
                  bosom, resolving to inquire at the earliest opportunity, the route the pedler had
                  taken; but the opportunity was much nearer than she imagined, fer when she reached
                  her favourite restingplace, there the identical young gentleman was reclining,
                  leaning on his red morocco trunk, his hat lying on the grass, and a
                  poetical-looking book in his hand.</p>
               <p>Clara started back in alarm and shame, at thus suddenly finding herself alone with
                  one whose presumption the restraining presence of her mother had failed to check.
                  The young man sprang upon his feet, but his manner, instead of being bold and
                  careless, was modest and respectful.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," said he, "if I have intruded upon a spot, which, perhaps, is by right
                  appropriated to yourself. If so, forgive the sympathy which drew me hither."</p>
               <p>Clara's alarm subsided at the deference of his address, but her embarrassment
                  remained.</p>
               <p>"I have no right here, sir," replied she, "beyond your own. But since I meet you
                  so unexpectedly, I would wish——" Here Clara stammered; for in restoring the ring,
                  she knew not how to avoid wounding his feelings, without compromising her own
                  dignity. She drew forth the paper, which she had concealed in the foldings of her
                  dress, and handing it toward him, with a look which she intended to be cold and
                  severe, added, "this ring which I found on my table, I believe lieve must be your
                  property. I was wishing for an opportunity to return it, as it appears to be of
                  value."</p>
               <p>"Do you then scorn my offering?" said he, drawing back with an air of deep
                  mortification; "was I too presumptuous, in daring to leave this little token of
                  the admiration with which you had inspired me? I know my situation is lowly, and
                  those who look upon wealth and station as what constitute the man, may regard me
                  with contempt; but there is something in your countenance that encouraged me to
                  think you were above the false prejudices of the world. No! madam, I cannot take
                  back the gift, worthless henceforth, if refused by you. It shall never encircle
                  another's finger; but lie in the grass beneath our feet, to mingle its pearls with
                  the dews of night."</p>
               <p>Poor Clara! assailed by flattery, breathed in poetical high-flown language such as
                  she had read in books, but never expected to hear addressed to herself—delighted,
                  in the midst of her confusion, at meeting with so romantic an incident in her
                  hitherto uneventful life—she could not repulse with harshness her humble
                  admirer.</p>
               <p>"It is not from scorn that I refused your gift," answered she; "but you must be
                  conscious of the extreme impropriety of my permitting such freedom in a stranger.
                  Your conduct is very strange, sir—very unauthorized."</p>
               <p>"Is it strange," said Rover, without seeming disconcerted by her rebuke, "to
                  admire what is beautiful, or unauthorized to wish it our own?—In my somewhat idle
                  and wandering life, I have had leisure<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6687-00000109"/>
                  to cultivate the taste and imagination nature has given me, and I think I can say,
                  mine is no vulgar stamp. Books are my constant companions, poetry my passion, and
                  nature my study and delight. I am sure I speak what is true, and your own heart
                  can bear witness to it—there is something congenial to your own character in mine.
                  Two kindred souls can read each other at a glance, while discordant spirits may
                  remain strangers for years."</p>
               <p>He accompanied these words by a glance such as Clara never met before, and it made
                  her heart throb, and her cheek kindle. There was a glow, too, mantling his own
                  dark cheek, an eloquent commentary on the warmth of his language. She cast down
                  her eyes, and they rested on the hateful trunk—the badge of the pedler—and her
                  mind all at once took in the ridiculous position in which she was placed. A pedler
                  for her lover! A stranger whom she had never seen but once before; and then her
                  mother, gentle as she was, had shut the door in his face, incensed at his
                  familiarity. Then the vision of the proud Washington Graham, such as Gertrude had
                  depicted, came in dazzling contrast, to increase her mortification. These
                  thoughts, so chilling to romance, gave her sufficient composure to speak, and
                  resolution enough to speak as she ought.</p>
               <p>"I cannot forgive myself for continuing this conversation so long. I feel more and
                  more sensible of its impropriety. Since you leave me no other alternative, you
                  force me to lay your treasure where the dews of night will indeed deface its
                  lustre."</p>
               <p>She said this in answer to a deprecating motion of his hand, as she again extended
                  the ring, and dropping it on the grass, she turned to depart, glorying in the
                  conquest she had made over the weakness and vanity which tempted her to linger and
                  accept an incense as novel as it was pleasing. Rover crushed the ring under his
                  feet, and his eye flashed scornfully.</p>
               <p>"I see I am mistaken. Every woman is a slave to opinion, and fears to follow the
                  dictates of her own heart. A fine coat and a fine equipage are the only passports
                  to her favour, and provided the world approve her choice, it matters not whether
                  she is tortured by unkindness, or frozen by indifference."</p>
               <p>Clara stopped, for her spirits were roused, and she forgot her timidity, that she
                  might vindicate herself from such an assertion.</p>
               <p>"Whatever claims you may offer as an individual," said she, "to confidence and
                  respect, you must be conscious you have chosen a profession that precludes you, by
                  its itinerant habits, from the society in which we mingle. I am indeed astonished
                  that you are willing to pursue it, ignoble as it is deemed."</p>
               <p>"If I should tell you the history of my life," he answered, more calmly, "you
                  would find, perhaps, that I had been a rebellious youth, too proud to labour, too
                  independent to solicit favour, who wanted to see a little of the world, and
                  thought it just as honest and respectable to walk through it with a pedler's trunk
                  and a clear conscience as to wear a lawyer's gown or carry a doctor's lance. But,"
                  added he, dismissing his sarcastic tone for one of deep feeling<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000110"/> ing, "if you dislike me because the world dubs me
                     <hi rend="i"/>pedler, I will be any thing and every thing you please, if I may
                  be animated with the hope of one day winning your affections. Yet the love that is
                  capable of defying any reproach, and encountering any obstacle, that can trample
                  pride and vanity, and the world itself, under its feet, is the only love that can
                  satisfy the boundless wishes of my heart. If I cannot meet with this, I will
                  continue a wanderer through life, dealing in tinsel and gewgaws, rejoicing the
                  while in my own independence."</p>
               <p>It was impossible for the imaginative and inexperienced Clara, to listen to these
                  high-wrought sentiments, so exactly corresponding to her own, without being moved.
                  She could not disdain one who laughed to scorn the distinctions of society, and
                  who, proud of his in born wealth, asserted his claims to regard as one of nature's
                  aristocrats. In vain she sought to leave him, till she had admitted the
                  possibility that he might see her again, and had promised that the dread of
                  meeting him should not banish her entirely from her wonted walks.</p>
               <p>When alone once more, she wept at her imprudence, and would have given worlds to
                  live over again the last hour, that she might recall the faint encouragement she
                  had given. She knew she was wrong in concealing the circumstance from her mother
                  and brother; but she tried to persuade herself that he would soon leave the
                  neighbourhood, and forget his foolish admiration of herself, so there could be no
                  necessity of revealing what would only expose him to their resentment. She
                  avoided, after this, the place where she had met him; but there were other shaded
                  walks, and her mother told her that her health would suffer for want of exercise.
                  It would be impossible to live within doors all the time in warm summer weather,
                  and it is not strange that she again encountered the persevering pedler, or that
                  the dread and the shame that at first oppressed her, gradually melted away in the
                  fascination of their romantic and untold meetings. Each time she said to
                  herself—"It shall be the last;" but faint and wavering are the resolutions of
                  youth, opposed to the growing influence of the strongest passion of the heart. He
                  no longer carried the odious red trunk, and she tried to forget that she had ever
                  seen it. When with him, it was an easy task, listening to such language, and
                  looked upon by such eyes, soft, yet bright, so luminously dark! Even the gipsy hue
                  of his complexion, gave him a wild charm in her eyes, harmonizing, as it did, with
                  his wandering habits and eccentric character.</p>
               <p>As Clara was walking, lost in these dangerous reveries, hesitating whether she
                  should proceed where she was almost sure of meeting one who seemed like an
                  invisible being to watch her footsteps, and know whither they were bound, or to
                  remain nearer the guardian boundary of home, she was startled by the sound of
                  horses' feet behind her, and it forcibly reminded her of her brother's first
                  meeting with Mrs. Clifton, for it was precisely the same path, and likewise near
                  the sunset hour of day. She turned her head involuntarily, as the sound came near,
                  and drew<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6687-00000111"/> back as far as the width of
                  the path would allow, to permit the stranger and his attendant to pass by. She did
                  this with a quickened pulse, for something told her it must be Washington Graham.
                  At any rate, he was no vulgar rider—for he was mounted on a coal-black horse,
                  splendidly caparisoned, and attended by a negro, who rode one of the same raven
                  colour, whose blackness was contrasted by a scarlet saddle-cloth, that almost
                  swept the ground. Clara was so dazzled by the magnificence of their appearance,
                  and so confused by the thought, that it was the hero appropriated to herself, by
                  the splendid imagination of Gertrude, she could not clearly discern the
                  gentleman's features, though he raised his hat as he passed, with a graceful bow,
                  and slackened his pace, till he disappeared in the direction of the white house on
                  the hill.</p>
               <p>"What a singular coincidence!" said Clara to herself. "Just on this spot did
                  Edward first behold Mrs. Clifton, on horseback, too, and that glance decided his
                  destiny!" The ardent glance of Rover flashed through her memory, and, conscious of
                  the struggle of vanity and feeling in the heart, she believed herself unworthy of
                  the homage it expressed.</p>
               <p>"What can he ever be to me, this proud, southern stranger," she added, "who comes
                  among us like an eastern nabob?—and yet I shall be to him an object of ridicule
                  and disgust, after Gertrude's glowing description. Had he never heard my name, I
                  might escape his notice, but now it is impossible."</p>
               <p>While her mind was wrought up to a state of feverish excitement by the anticipated
                  meeting with the dreaded stranger, her eyes were fixed on the windows of her
                  brother's dwelling, illuminated as they now were, by the setting sunbeams, and she
                  could see the dark outlines of the two riders defined upon them; then she knew
                  that her conjecture was right. Most willingly would she have sought some covert in
                  the woods, and fed on berries and herbs for weeks to come, to avoid the
                  mortification she believed was in store for her;—but she fortunately remembered
                  she had a mother, who was probably even now waiting her return with anxiety, for
                  the soft gray of twilight was beginning to steal over sunset's golden tints.</p>
               <p>The next day she received a summons from Gertrude, telling her there was to be a
                  general gathering of friends to welcome the arrival of her cousin, who was all
                  impatience to behold the fair rustic whose image was already drawn on his fancy in
                  such attractive colours. This message renewed the trepidation of Clara to such a
                  degree, that she was tempted to plead a nervous headache, as an excuse from
                  attendance. One moment she was ready to sink at the thought of her being contemned
                  and despised—the next the <emph>possibility</emph> that Washington Graham, lordly
                  as he seemed, might cast a favouring glance upon her, unpretending as she was,
                  filled her with dread. If so, what would become of poor Rover? And what would
                  Gertrude think if she turned coldly away from the attentions of her gifted cousin?
                  When arraying herself for the occasion, she tried to school herself into perfect
                  indifference with regard to her appearance<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000112"/> ance; but in vain. She repeated to herself a
                  hundred times, it was no matter how she looked. She could not obtain the
                  stranger's admiration, if she would—she would not, if she could—still she lingered
                  before her mirror, thinking it had never reflected a less pleasing image.—She was
                  entirely divested of ornaments, for she had not forgotten the bitter lesson taught
                  by the tinsel chain; but the "ornament of a meek and quiet spirit," which seeks no
                  praise or favour, for any outward gifts, Clara had not yet gained. The same vanity
                  that led her to barter her self-approbation for a paltry bauble, now caused her to
                  tremble, in anticipation of a stranger's scrutiny.—She thought it humility, and
                  would have wept at the suggestion, that one trace of the foible that had lately
                  cost her so dear was still lingering in her heart. The green branches were lopped
                  off, but the roots still clung to the parent, and when circumstances favoured
                  their growth, were ready to shoot forth with new luxuriance.</p>
               <p>When Clara found herself in the illuminated drawing-room, she saw nothing, for a
                  few moments, but bright spectres floating before her eyes, and heard nothing but a
                  ringing sound in her ears—loud as the echoes of a tolling bell. She had a kind of
                  consciousness that she was going through the ceremony of introduction to a
                  gentleman; but how he looked and what he said, she knew not.—He might have been
                  the veiled prophet Mohanna, for aught she knew of his face, for she never lifted
                  her eyes from the carpet, but stood clinging to her brother's arm: her cheeks
                  burning ing with blushes, indeed her whole face and even her neck was covered with
                  the same crimson hue. Clara knew that the deep suffusion she was undergoing was
                  any thing but becoming, and this conviction only added to the intensity of the
                  glow. The idea that she was actually in the presence of the formidable Washington
                  Graham, the prophesied hero of her destiny, was too overwhelming. He addressed her
                  in the common language of courtesy, but she could only answer in monosyllables,
                  and whispering to her brother to lead her to a window, he drew her away pitying
                  her confusion, yet vexed at her unwonted awkwardness and taciturnity.</p>
               <p>"Leave me here," said she to Gertrude, who followed her to her retreat, "there are
                  so many people in the centre of the room, that I cannot breathe. I will not
                  disgrace you here."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> leave you, dear Clara, since you desire it," answered she,
                  with a calm sweetness of manner that operated like a charm in soothing Clara's
                  preposterous agitation, "and only remember that while you are just to yourself,
                  you can never disgrace us. But for my sake, for Edward's sake, try to recover your
                  self-possession, and give my kinsman the welcome I have dared to promise him from
                  the sister of my husband."</p>
               <p>Clara felt the gentle rebuke conveyed in these words, as she followed with her
                  eyes Gertrude's retreating figure, admiring that surpassing gracefulness which
                  distinguished her above all other women. She could not but admire still more the
                  kindness and forbearance<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6687-00000113"/> ance she
                  manifested towards one so untutored and wayward as herself. The soft evening air
                  that flowed in through the open window, cooled her fevered cheeks, while the
                  circumstance of her being permitted to remain quiet much longer than she
                  anticipated, composed, while it mortified her. She dreaded observation—she equally
                  dreaded neglect; and when she saw Washington Graham conversing with some ladies on
                  the opposite side of the room, without making any effort to disturb her solitude,
                  and by their pleased and attentive countenances knew that he was saying what
                  seemed very agreeable and entertaining, she felt <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"It were better to stand the lightning's shock,</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>She had but a partial view of his face, as it was somewhat turned from her, but
                  his figure struck her as being remarkably graceful and gentleman-like. In a little
                  while he changed his position, and her heart palpitated anew, for she thought he
                  was approaching her; but no! he was drawing near his cousin, who, having been
                  compelled to take her seat at the harp, (an instrument which still possessed all
                  the charm of novelty with her guests,) was beckoning him to her side. Clara, like
                  her brother, was passionately fond of music, and Gertrude's always thrilled to her
                  very soul. But now a manly voice of exquisite melody mingled its deep notes with
                  hers, and both blending with the full, breeze-like strains of the harp, "rose like
                  a stream of rich distilled perfume." Edward was leaning over the instrument in the
                  same attitude she remembered to have seen him at Mrs. Clifton's
                  never-to-be-forgotten party, but then his face was pale and his countenance dark;
                  now it was lighted up with an expression of fervour and happiness as intense as
                  the human features are capable of wearing, and Gertrude's eyes, floating in liquid
                  radiance, were occasionally lifted to his, beaming with the love she no longer
                  sought to bury in the foldings of her own heart.</p>
               <p>"Surely," thought Clara, "I have never loved Edward, or my nature is too cold to
                  love as she does, and yet my very existence seemed bound up in his. Can there be a
                  love stronger than that which binds together an only brother and sister, when that
                  brother, too, exercises a father's tender guardianship, in place of him who is
                  laid low with the dead?"</p>
               <p>As she asked herself this question, the image of Rover seemed to glide before her,
                  and memory whispered, "The glance of Rover, when it bends on me, expresses the
                  same depth and fire, and can it be that he loves me more than Edward? And will he
                  ever fill, and more than fill a brother's place within my heart? Dare I ever avow
                  the interest he has inspired, to those who have woven my destiny with that of this
                  dazzling stranger?"</p>
               <p>At this moment the face of Washington was turned towards her, and though her
                  vision was somewhat obscured by the tears that involuntarily suffused her eyes,
                  she could observe its lineaments, and she thought she could trace in every feature
                  the pride of wealth and conscious superiority. His fine figure was set off by a
                  dress of aristocratic elegance; his hair was<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000114"/> arranged in carless but graceful waves around his
                  temples, revealing a forehead, whose unsunned whiteness plainly indicated that he
                  at least was exempt from the primeval curse of earning his bread by the sweat of
                  his brow. The southern sun had given to his cheeks a manlier glow, so that the
                  idea of effeminacy could never be associated with Washington Graham, who looked
                  exactly what he was, a gentleman by nature, by birth, by wealth, and by education.
                  The music had so far subdued Clara, and carried her out of herself, that when
                  Gertrude again approached her, accompanied by her cousin, she received them with
                  less trepidation, and she ventured to listen and speak, though still with her eyes
                  bowed down in "penetrative shame." Had Clara been conscious of her own
                  attractions, she would not have suffered so much from self-distrust. She could not
                  know them, for when she saw herself reflected in the looking-glass, in the act of
                  dressing, her features were at rest, and there was nothing sufficiently striking
                  in their outline, or dazzling in their hue, to give her an exalted image of her
                  own loveliness. She never saw the roses flitting over her cheeks, coming and
                  going, and coming again, heralds of the heart's spring-time, or the warm and
                  shifting lustre of her eye, when enthusiasm or sensibility stirred its peaceful
                  depths. What if she had made a conquest of a poor wandering pedler? This
                  magnificent Washington Graham was a very different kind of person, and the idea
                  that he would look upon her with admiration or love, was too absurd to be
                  admitted, and it would certainly expose pose her to the ridicule of all her
                  acquaintances, if it were but known that it had ever entered into her mind. But
                  when she was once more alone in her room, and reflected on the events of the
                  evening, though filled with mortification at her own want of self-control, she
                  rejoiced she had stood the ordeal without any open violation of decorum, and
                  without incurring any visible marks of contempt. The thought that she had been
                  seen, and that the illusion created by Gertrude was consequently dispelled, was
                  very comforting to her. Another thought gave her a feeling of delight and
                  self-approbation—why, she could not define—Rover lost nothing in her estimation in
                  comparison with the elegant southerner. She would rather live over again the
                  moments passed with him in the midst of nature's loveliness, stolen and hurried as
                  they were, and always accompanied with the dread of detection and the
                  consciousness of acting a clandestine part, than spend a thousand such evenings as
                  this—so cold, constrained and formal. Clara was a mystery to herself—foolish girl
                  that she was, to find a happiness in contemplations which should fill her with
                  sorrow and self-reproach! The next day, Gertrude came to her with a congratulating
                  smile.</p>
               <p>"I feared last night, dear Clara," said she, "when you acted the part of the
                  blushing automaton, that my character as prophetess was more than endangered, that
                  it was lost. But cousin Washington declares himself enchanted with that very
                  bashfulness and simplicity that deprived you of your native grace. He is so sick
                  of the artificial glare of fashionable<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6687-00000115"/>
                  society, so weary of glitter and display, his eye reposes with delight, as he
                  expresses it, on the soft green of your character."</p>
               <p>"Stop," cried Clara, "you do but mock me. His practised tongue may well utter the
                  language of flattery, but do not, dearest Gertrude, solicit his admiration for me.
                  To gratify your affection he may profess an interest I know he can never feel. You
                  know not how wounding is the thought that I should be forced, as it were, upon the
                  particular notice of a gentleman like him!"</p>
               <p>"Believe me, Clara," answered Gertrude, earnestly, "I will do nothing to wound
                  your delicacy or pride. I will say nothing more at present, leaving it for time to
                  unfold events, which I trust will justify all I have ventured to express; one
                  thing only let me ask, what think you of my vaunted cousin?"</p>
               <p>"I have no distinct impression left on my mind," answered Clara, "so deep was the
                  embarrassment that oppressed me. He appeared to me like something bright, lofty,
                  and cold."</p>
               <p>"Oh," said Gertrude, "you do not know him yet. Beneath that somewhat cold
                  exterior, the result of a premature experience of the world's heartlessness, there
                  is a depth of feeling known only to those who see him free from the restraints of
                  society. Handsome, intellectual and rich—romantic, too, in the best sense in which
                  that oft perverted word is used, I should not think it possible that Washington
                  Graham could fail to win a young and disengaged heart like yours."</p>
               <p>The soft blush that had hitherto coloured the cheek of Clara, was pale to the
                  crimson that now dyed its surface.</p>
               <p>"He leaves us to-morrow for a few days," continued Gertrude, "and when he returns,
                  I hope to see all my fondest wishes realized."</p>
               <p>Clara breathed as if recovering from a fit of the nightmare. She pleaded every
                  excuse to be permitted to remain at home that evening. She had a nervous headache,
                  she was unfit to appear in company, she did not like to leave her mother alone; in
                  short, she gave twenty reasons, any one of which was sufficient in itself to
                  answer her purpose.</p>
               <p>"My head really does ache," said Clara, after Gertrude's departure, "and I think a
                  walk in the fresh air will revive me; though unfit for company, I am not ashamed
                  of being seen by the cattle and the birds." How she disposed of her objections to
                  leave her mother alone, remained a mystery even to herself. She had never met
                  Rover in the path in which she now walked, and he could not know the direction she
                  had taken; yet she started when the wind moved the branches or the birds flew
                  rustling through the leaves, as if these accustomed sounds were the harbingers of
                  coming footsteps. She was unwilling to acknowledge to herself the disappointment
                  that weighed upon her spirits; but not finding in her walk the exhilarating
                  influence she anticipated, she turned her face homeward.</p>
               <p>"He has probably heard of the arrival of Washington Graham," thought Clara, "and
                  believes me paying homage to his wealth and pretensions. He<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000116"/> does me injustice, but it is no matter. Better, far
                  better that we should never meet again—for he can never be any thing to me. Edward
                  would not disdain his poverty, for he was himself once poor. But a pedler! Mrs.
                  Clifton would not have married Edward if he had been an itinerant pedler."</p>
               <p>Just as Clara had finished these reflections, which breathed more of pique than
                  she was aware of, she heard a sudden crashing among the boughs, and the pedler
                  himself bounded into the path, his dark complexion glowing from the rapidity of
                  his motions, and his eye sparkling with more than its wonted fire.</p>
               <p>"I feared that I might be forgotten," said he; "but I see that I have wronged
                  you—yet if village rumour has been true, it is a hopeless devotion, an act of
                  still greater presumption. It says that a stranger of wealth and distinction,
                  conspicuous for the display and pride of his appearance, is come hither for the
                  sole purpose of addressing and wedding Clara Stanley. It says, too, that he will
                  not address her in vain."</p>
               <p>The characteristic openness and boldness of this address left Clara no room for
                  evasion. She did not wish to acknowledge its truth—she would not give utterance to
                  a falsehood. Unpractised in the arts which could teach her the way of extrication,
                  she stood silent and embarrassed, wishing the good people of the village would
                  find something else to talk about besides the Stanleys, whose concerns seemed to
                  interest them so much.</p>
               <p>"You are silent, Clara," cried he, in an altered tone; "you do not deny it, and
                  heaven forbid you should, if for once village gossip has spoken the truth. I have
                  no right to reproach you—you have professed nothing—promised nothing—and yet I
                  feel as if I were waking from the sweetest and brightest dream that ever gladdened
                  the heart of man—the dream of imagined perfection."</p>
               <p>Clara's heart swelled under the consciousness of injustice, and she would have
                  made an indignant reply, but the deep dejection of his countenance and air
                  inspired her with pity.</p>
               <p>"If I deserved upbraiding from you," said she, "I should not at this moment be
                  dreading the reproaches of all whom I love. Whatever may be said of this
                  stranger's visit, his coming can never influence my feelings towards you."</p>
               <p>The last words were uttered in a tremulous voice. She began to feel as if she had
                  forsaken the "guide of her youth," and rashly given her happiness into a
                  stranger's keeping. In the true spirit of a heroine, though true only to the
                  impulse of nature, she covered her face with her hands, and, sitting down at the
                  foot of the tree beneath which they were standing, tried to think herself
                  miserable; but, strange as it may seem, a thrill of delight still penetrated her
                  heart, from the conviction that she was beloved. Nothing was more natural, from
                  the lowly position she had assumed, for Rover to kneel at her side; and he did
                  kneel in exactly the same graceful attitude in which she first beheld him, when he
                  bent to display his jewels to her admiring gaze; but Clara had forgotten all
                     that,<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6687-00000117"/> and she soon forgot every
                  thing else but the words he breathed into her ear, and the looks that bore witness
                  to their sincerity.</p>
               <p>The next morning, as she was tying up some wandering vines, that answered all the
                  purposes of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">jalousies,</foreign> to the window, she heard
                  the tramping of horses' feet, and Washington Graham, on his raven black horse,
                  accompanied by his black attendant, with the red saddle cloth sweeping so
                  magnificently on either side, was seen passing by. He lifted his hat, and bowed
                  till his hair almost touched his horse's flowing mane, then rode rapidly by. Clara
                  thought of the Black Knight in Ivanhoe; of Ivanhoe himself, and almost expected to
                  see the days of tournaments and queens of love and beauty revived.</p>
               <p>"He is certainly very, very graceful," said she, shading her eyes to catch the
                  last glimpse of his knight-like figure, yet vexed at being forced to bring him in
                  lordly contrast to the contemned Rover, assured that in every thing but outward
                  show, Rover transcended the southern nabob. "But I dare say he is very proud, and
                  the maiden that he will wed must also be proud and rich, as she will be beautiful
                  and accomplished." And with a half-suppressed sigh at the inequalities of
                  fortune's gifts, she resumed her occupation, which naturally led her thoughts back
                  to rural life and cottage scenes, and it was not long before she was indulging
                  most heroic scorn for every joy dependent on wealth or fortune.</p>
               <p>Clara sat one evening alone with her mother, her head bent over her work. Whenever
                  she was thus situated, her secret weighed heavily on her heart, and the dread of
                  detection was never absent from her mind. If Mrs. Stanley addressed her suddenly,
                  she would start and turn pale—if she looked upon her earnestly, she would tremble
                  and blush, and sometimes she would talk at random, and commit a thousand
                  inconsistencies. She rejoiced at the entrance of a neighbour, for it saved her the
                  trouble of talking, and left her to the indulgence of her own thoughts. Mrs.
                  Morton, the lady who now made her appearance, was only desirous of listeners, for
                  she came laden with news she was eager to impart before she could be forestalled
                  in the office.</p>
               <p>"This is a very unpleasant affair about that young pedler," said Mrs. Morton;
                  "have you heard of it?"</p>
               <p>Clara's ears tingled at these words, and she held her breath to listen. Mrs.
                  Stanley expressed her ignorance, and Mrs. Morton proceeded.</p>
               <p>"You recollect that a shocking murder and robbery were perpetrated not very long
                  since in an adjoining town, and that great rewards were offered for the
                  apprehension of the murderer. It seems they have discovered a gang of pedlers, who
                  are going about murdering and plundering in every direction. Some one who knew the
                  gentleman who has been lately murdered, says he can swear to one of the watches
                  among the jewels of the young pedler who has been sauntering about here. He says
                  he has seen it in the gentleman's possession, and has no doubt he is both a robber
                  and a murderer. They have taken up the young man upon suspicion, and he is now<pb
                     n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6687-00000118"/> confined in jail. The probability is he
                  will be hung."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed shocking to hear of such crimes," replied Mrs. Stanley, "when the
                  actors, too, are brought so near our own homes. I thought there was something very
                  suspicious about that young man, and I feared he might be troublesome to us."</p>
               <p>She looked at Clara as she spoke, but she seemed to take no interest in the
                  conversation, remaining perfectly still, with her head bowed, so that the lamp
                  shone brightly on the ringlets that shaded her face, leaving her features in a
                  still deeper shade.</p>
               <p>While Mrs. Morton went on with earnestness and volubility, describing all she knew
                  of the event in exaggerated colours, Clara rose softly and left the room. She
                  stepped cautiously through the passage, and down the steps, opened the gate with a
                  noiseless touch, and then ran like lightning through the street. It was a
                  moonlight night, and she could see her own shadow flitting on every wall,
                  lengthening into spectral dimensions, as she flew on, as if the avenger of blood
                  was behind. She slackened not her pace, even while ascending the hill on which her
                  brother's house was situated, nor paused till she reached the avenue of trees that
                  stood in long stately lines in front of the mansion. For a moment she stopped, and
                  looked back at the light that glimmered from her mother's window, like a solitary
                  star, luring the wanderer home—then renewing her flight, she found herself all at
                  once in the presence of Gertrude, who was sitting alone in her chamber, little
                  dreaming of so strange an interruption tion. She rose in unspeakable alarm at
                  Clara's entrance, whose appearance fully justified the feeling Her face was of
                  ashy paleness, her lips parted and quivering, and her long hair hung unbound over
                  her shoulders in damp clinging masses.</p>
               <p>"Clara, dear Clara," exclaimed Gertrude, "tell me what has happened! You know
                  nothing of Edward? Speak!"</p>
               <p>"Is Edward gone! Thank heaven!" uttered Clara, and sinking into a chair, she burst
                  into tears. Gertrude threw her arms around her, and held her sobbing head against
                  her bosom, till, like a wearied child, she gradually ceased her tears. The hot
                  pressure on her brain seemed loosened, but there was anguish in her heart. There
                  was but one sound in her ears—"He will in all probability be hung!" There was but
                  one image before her eyes—Rover, a dying victim to a false accusation. She
                  believed him as guiltless of crime as her own brother was, and the one strong
                  purpose of her soul was to liberate him, at the hazard of her own liberty, and
                  life itself, if it were necessary. She had read of Helen Mar, who followed into
                  captivity the Scottish chieftain; of the devoted Lavalette, who effected the
                  escape of her husband from the walls of a prison by clothing him in her own
                  garments, and assuming his bondage instead. Impulse and action were almost
                  simultaneous with Clara. She stopped not to think of the censure of the world, the
                  reproaches of her friends. Rover in prison—exposed to an ignominious death, alone
                  filled her mind. The circumstances of Edward's absence, who had been called<pb
                     n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6687-00000119"/> away upon some unexpected business, was
                  favourable to her design, for she was sure of the co-operation of Gertrude.</p>
               <p>"Dear Gertrude," said she, "I cannot tell you the cause of my grief, but if you
                  love me, do not refuse what I am going to ask of you."</p>
               <p>"I do love you, Clara, for more than your own sake, and mysterious as you are
                  to-night, I am ready to promise that whatever you ask shall be granted, assured
                  that it will be nothing but what justice may require and affection bestow."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, a thousand thanks," cried Clara. "Then, quick, dear Gertrude, lend me the
                  cloak, hood, and Mob Cap, which you wore when Edward first met you, and say not a
                  word of what you have done to a human being. Oh! Gertrude, you look as if you were
                  going to deny me!" and Clara clasped her hands supplicatingly together, as if her
                  life depended on the boon.</p>
               <p>"I would do any thing but suffer you to expose yourself to danger," said Gertrude,
                  a bright ray flitting over her face at meeting a spirit so congenial to her own.
                  "Any thing that will not serve as a barrier to separate you hereafter from
                  Washington Graham."</p>
               <p>"Talk not of Washington Graham," cried Clara, impatiently; "I think not of him, I
                  care not for him—nor is there danger to me. Hasten, I will do nothing but what
                  your own generous, uncalculating heart would prompt me to do."</p>
               <p>Gertrude withdrew a moment, and returned with her masquerade dress, which she kept
                  as a precious memento of her life's most romantic scenes. "My Clara," said she as
                  she entered, "the sight of these makes me almost wish I had again the task of
                  winning the heart which I first learned to prize beneath their muffling shades.
                  Never, never shall I forget the hour when Edward breathed into Aunt Bridget's ear
                  the story of his love for the high and lofty Widow Clifton."</p>
               <p>"Tell me," cried Clara, as she hastily wrapped her youthful person in the ancient
                  cloak, "if Edward had been in danger before you married him, what would you have
                  done to save him?"</p>
               <p>"What would I have done!" repeated Gertrude, passionately, "I would have died to
                  save him. Had I ten thousand lives, I would peril them all for him at this moment,
                  so entirely, so devotedly do I love him."</p>
               <p>Clara could have worshipped her for this burst of enthusiasm, sanctioning as it
                  did her own purposed devotion, and with firmer hand she tied the mob cap under her
                  chin, put on the green spectacles, and drew the hood over her head.
                  Notwithstanding Clara's distress, Gertrude could not forbear smiling at her
                  antiquated little figure, wondering whether she had ever looked as obselete
                  herself. "Now speed thee, dear Clara, and heaven bless thy purpose, whatever it
                  may be," cried she, leading her down the steps of the piazza.</p>
               <p>Clara was obliged to gather her cloak round her, as it trailed on the ground, and
                  impeded her walking. Then she recollected, that if so aged a person as she<pb
                     n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6687-00000120"/> appeared to be, were seen running, it
                  would excite suspicion, and she tried to fashion her movements to the character
                  she had assumed. She met several boys, who terrified her by hallooing in her ear,
                  "Goodnight, grandmother—what will you take for your spectacles?" Without turning
                  her head, she walked on with quicker steps till she arrived at the prison. She had
                  been there before to visit a poor black woman, who was very sick, and who had been
                  accused of an attempt to poison a white family. She died in prison, and her
                  innocence was proved too late. She knew the jailer, too, a simple, kind-hearted
                  man; and when in faltering accents, which might well pass for the trembling
                  utterance of age, she requested admittance to the pedler, (that hateful name
                  almost choked Clara, for she had never breathed it aloud since she had first known
                  Rover,) the good jailer immediately granted her admission. Rover was seated in a
                  remote corner of the gloomy apartment, his head resting on his hand, the dim light
                  scarcely defining the dark outlines of his figure. He raised his dark eyes upon
                  her entrance, and they flashed with lamp-like brilliancy through the shades that
                  surrounded him. He was in danger and disgrace, and Clara felt that if she had
                  resolved to act a heroic part, she would do it in the true spirit of a heroine.
                  She drew near him without speaking, while he, with the courtesy which adorns a
                  prison as much as a drawing-room, rose and offered her his seat, wondering what
                  good old lady was so kind as to visit him in this extremity. Clara sunk into the
                  chair, and gathering courage now the critical moment had arrived, untied the
                  strings of her cloak and cap, and emerged from the disguise like the evening star
                  from behind a gray cloud.</p>
               <p>"Clara Stanley, by all that is lovely!" exclaimed he; and the graceful pedler
                  knelt at her feet. A bright triumphant smile played about his lips. "Welcome
                  imprisonment, danger, and death itself, if they bring with them consolations like
                  this. You believe me innocent, then," added he, "or deeming me guilty, have come
                  to pity and—"</p>
               <p>"To save!" interrupted Clara, "to save, believing you innocent. In this apparel
                  you can pass out undiscovered, and fly the wretches who seek your life. As for me,
                  there is no danger. They will release me as soon as they learn that I am
                  here."</p>
               <p>"What! leave you here alone in this dismal place, the long dark night, exposed to
                  present suffering and future calumny, that I may elude dangers, which after all,
                  are imaginary, for my life is in no peril! I can produce such proofs of my
                  innocence as will cover my accusers with shame. No! no! I cannot leave this cell.
                  It is transformed into the garden of Eden—since I have here learned what I have
                  hitherto dared to doubt, the truth, the tenderness, the heroism of woman's
                  love."</p>
               <p>"And shall I have braved every thing in vain?" cried Clara, imploringly. "Your
                  innocence will serve you nothing when law in its strength is once aimed against
                  you. Even in this very cell I saw a poor creature breathe her last, accused,
                  though guiltless, condemned and broken-hearted. And I shall be as safe<pb
                     n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6687-00000121"/> here as in my own chamber. The jailer
                  knows me—my mother has been kind to his children, and he will be kind to me; I
                  shall immediately be released. What! still unyielding? Have you upbraided
                     <emph>me</emph> for coldness and pride, and fear of the world's censure?—but
                  who now is cold and proud, and unwilling to incur a debt of gratitude?"</p>
               <p>Rover fixed his steadfast gaze on Clara's now glowing countenance. She seemed
                  transformed. Her eyes, that had always bowed abashed beneath the beams of his,
                  were riveted intently on his face—and the hand which had never willingly been
                  abandoned to his hold, now clasped his, in the energy of her address.</p>
               <p>"Clara," said he, and his voice trembled with deep emotion, "this is no time for
                  deception—on one condition only will I fly. Should my fame be cleared, and my
                  character proved upright and pure, will you allow me to declare my love before the
                  world, and consent to unite your fate to mine, however poor and lowly I may
                  be?"</p>
               <p>"I will consent to any thing that obtains a mother's sanction," replied Clara, in
                  low but firm accents; then snatching up the cloak, and throwing it over his
                  shoulders, she entreated him to hasten, as footsteps were heard echoing through
                  the passage. There was no time to be lost, and he hastily gathered the folds of
                  his cloak around him; but when he bent his head for the mob cap and spectacles,
                  unconquerable mirth struggled with the tumultuous feeling excited in his bosom.
                  Even Clara, though wrought upon by a thousand fears, could not forbear laughing at
                  the ludicrous effect of the headdress; then she wept to think she could have
                  laughed at such a moment. She was sure that Madame Lavallette did not laugh when
                  she liberated her husband from the gloomy Concierge, and he must have looked
                  equally grotesque in her French mantle and veil. The cold sound of the turning key
                  banished every thought but her separation from Rover. "And now," whispered she,
                  "Rover, farewell—take the wings of the morning, that all pursuit may be vain."</p>
               <p>The gray folds of the cloak were for one moment wrapped closely around her, and a
                  soft deep voice murmured in her ear,—"farewell, generous, noble, and devoted
                  Clara. Your holy confidence shall never be betrayed. You shall yet find me all
                  your trusting heart believed."</p>
               <p>The door slowly creaked open. Clara sprang into the darkest corner of the cell,
                  while the prisoner passed out to the jailer, who remained on the outer side. She
                  trembled, for she distinctly heard the latter mutter, as he fumbled about the
                  keyhole, "the old woman might have had the manners to speak to a body. She strided
                  by me as fierce as a dragoon. I wonder what she wanted of the pedler. I'll go in
                  and see if all is safe."</p>
               <p>He reopened the door, looked round the cell, and was about to close it, when
                  returning and shading his eyes with his hand, "I thought I saw something white in
                  this corner. As sure as I am alive it is a woman! Bless my stars, if it is not
                  Miss Clara Stanley!"</p>
               <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6687-00000122"/>
               <p>Clara's first impulse was to rush by him and escape through the open door; her
                  next was to remain and prevent him from pursuing Rover.</p>
               <p>"Why, where is the pedler?" cried he, looking from side to side in amazement and
                  dismay. "Ah, ha! I know what made the old woman walk so fast. But I'll catch him
                  yet."</p>
               <p>"No, no!" exclaimed Clara, springing forward, and holding him by the arm. "You
                  cannot be so cruel. He is innocent, and you might have his life to answer
                  for."</p>
               <p>"But it is as much as my place is worth to let him go," said the jailer,
                  struggling to free himself from Clara's hold, whose slender fingers seemed gifted
                  with wondrous strength.</p>
               <p>"It is a cruel office," cried Clara, "and I would not wish to keep it; and if you
                  do lose it you shall have a better one instead. My brother shall exert his
                  influence, and you shall not be blamed. Dear, good jailer! do not be angry, but
                  remain quiet here. I never asked a favour of you before, and you have said my
                  mother has been kind to you."</p>
               <p>"So she has, and a blessed woman she is," replied he; "and so have you, too, as to
                  that matter; but what makes you take on so about it? Is that young pedler any kin
                  of yours?"</p>
               <p>"No," answered Clara, blushing; "but I knew he was innocent, and I pitied
                  him—sorry, indeed, should I be, if I could not be kind to any but my own
                  kindred."</p>
               <p>Clara continued her pleadings, and, in short, as the jailer said, had "such a
                  taking, coaxing way, there was no getting away from her," so that she at last
                  persuaded him to let the matter rest, and suffer it to be supposed that the
                  prisoner had broke loose from confinement. He promised, too, to say nothing about
                  her agency, and to permit her to depart unmolested.</p>
               <p>"But you must not go bare-headed and bare-necked through the damp air," said he,
                  "the folks will think you crazy. Stop till I get you a bonnet and shawl of my
                  wife's. I can get them without disturbing her, and you can send them back in the
                  morning."</p>
               <p>Clara thanked him for his consideration, and the fear of being taken up for a
                  crazy woman induced her to accept the offer. But when he brought her a
                  wonderful-looking shawl, flowered all over with beasts and birds, and a straw
                  bonnet which looked as if it had survived a hundred fashions, she feared the
                  danger still existed, and that she would lose her own identity in the various
                  transformations of the evening. The good-natured jailer laughed heartily, and said
                  "there was a good deal in things belonging to a person, and fitting them, after
                  all, for they became his wife mightily."</p>
               <p>Clara showered down her blessings upon him, and returned home, while, like
                  Collins' Passions, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"By turns she felt her glowing mind</l>
                        <l>Disturb'd, delighted, raised, refined."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"How shall I meet my mother?" thought she, when she reached her own door, and she
                  stood on the threshold pale and trembling. The exultation of<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000123"/> having performed a generous action no longer buoyed
                  up her spirits with unnatural excitement. She felt that she was a daughter, acting
                  independently of a mother's sanction, and she shrunk from the terrors of her
                  penetrating gaze. A glance through the window, from which the light streamed in
                  glimmering rays, relieved her worst fears. She saw her mother quietly seated at a
                  little work-table, her Bible opened before her, entirely absorbed by its sacred
                  pages. Clara was too much accustomed to pass her evening in her chamber, for her
                  absence to excite observation, and Mrs. Stanley usually sat up till a late hour,
                  the tranquillity of the night harmonizing with her chastened and religious tone of
                  character. Clara stole softly up stairs, hastily divested herself of her strange
                  attire, and, smoothing down her disordered locks, endeavoured to compose herself
                  to rest. But no slumber that night visited the couch of Clara. Her nerves were
                  unstrung. The singing of the wind against the window made her start from her
                  pillow. The clouds drifting over the moon seemed the shadows of horsemen in the
                  fleetness of pursuit.</p>
               <p>The flight of the pedler became a matter of three days' wonder in town, during
                  which time active measures were taken to discover the place of his retreat, but in
                  vain. Intelligence was received, just as they had given up the pursuit as
                  hopeless, that the real murderer was apprehended, who, by a voluntary confession
                  of his crime, had exonerated the young pedler from the slightest imputation of
                  guilt, who again made his appearance in the village, the hero and lion of the day.
                  But what was the astonishment of the good people when it was reported that Clara
                  Stanley was actually going to be married at her brother's, where a splendid
                  wedding was to be given, and then they were to start off to some distant place,
                  where the pedler was to give up his profession, and try to pass off for a
                  gentleman! There was more reality and truth in these reports than is generally the
                  case in village gossip. The nuptials of Clara and young Rover were in full
                  preparation, through the influence of the all-conquering Gertrude. Edward and Mrs.
                  Stanley were induced to yield their consent. Rover declared his resolution of
                  relinquishing his present course of life, and embracing some honourable
                  profession, in which the energies of his mind could be called into exercise, and
                  Clara, who was, perhaps, a little disappointed at things going on so smoothly,
                  where she expected so much opposition, expressed her willingness to go with him to
                  the world's end, if it were necessary. She shrunk from the idea of a bridal
                  festival, but Gertrude insisted upon arranging every thing her own way.</p>
               <p>"If," said she, "you have shown yourself superior to the prejudices of the world,
                  in the independence of your choice, let it see that you glory in acknowledging
                  it."</p>
               <p>But when she would have lavished upon her those tasteful gifts affection loves to
                  bestow on such occasions, Clara put them from her, refusing to wear any thing more
                  adorning than a plain muslin robe.</p>
               <p>"If I am to be the bride of a poor man," said she, "the decorations of wealth are
                  not for me."</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6687-00000124"/>
               <p>She thought she had subdued every trace of her once besetting sin, but when she
                  sat in her own room, overcome by those feelings which press home on the heart of
                  the most thoughtless on their bridal day, she saw the unexpected apparition of
                  Washington Graham sweeping by on his raven black horse, in all the pride of
                  conscious wealth and aristocracy; she turned away from the sight in mortification
                  and dismay.</p>
               <p>"Gertrude must have known of his coming," said she, brushing away the tears that
                  trembled on her cheek, "and yet she gave me no warning. I cannot bear that he
                  should be present, to look down in scorn on one equal, if not superior to him in
                  every gift of nature and of God. May Rover forgive me this last lingering moment
                  of weakness, unworthy of her who is blest with a heart like his."</p>
               <p>The shades of evening came on, and Clara, in her robe of unadorned white, with the
                  bridal rose wreathed in her hair, was waiting, with palpitating heart, the
                  anticipated summons. She was already at her brother's, in an apartment adjoining
                  the drawing-rooms, which were fast filling with guests.</p>
               <p>"I am proud of my sister," exclaimed Gertrude, kissing her cheek, now pallid from
                  agitation.</p>
               <p>"Be not angry, dear Clara; though I have pleaded the cause of Rover with all the
                  interest so romantic a love could inspire. I cannot but feel for my cousin.
                  Washington Graham is here, returned once more to devote himself to the task which
                  I once dared to promise him would prove successful."</p>
               <p>"Never, never mention his name to me again," cried Clara, "nor seek to raise in me
                  emotions which sometimes triumph over my better nature. I have been the child of
                  vanity, and once sacrificed even my integrity to vain display and heartless
                  ambition. And now, when I have been struggling with my indwelling enemy, in the
                  strength of disinterested love alone, and feel as if I had come off conquering,
                  let not your hand, Gertrude, supply my vanquished foe with new arms to rob me of
                  my victory."</p>
               <p>The sudden unfolding of the doors prevented Gertrude's reply. A flame of light
                  poured its effulgence into Clara's eyes, and every thing swam in confusion before
                  her gaze. The room appeared to turn round with a circular motion, and every figure
                  to blend together in strange confusion. She was only conscious of being led
                  forward into the centre of the room by a hand that trembled as much as her own,
                  and of hearing a buzzing sound around her like the murmur of many voices.</p>
               <p>"Be not dismayed, dear Clara," said the bridegroom, in a low voice, in her ear;
                  "your generous confidence shall never be betrayed."</p>
               <p>Clara, who had been gradually raising her eyes from the floor, as they recovered
                  the sense of vision, perceived that every face was turned towards the bridegroom,
                  with a stare of amazement. It was more than curiosity. It was wonder mixed with
                  incredulity. Involuntarily following the direction of their glances, she raised
                  her eyes to the face of him on whose arm she was leaning, and a wild exclamation
                  escaped her lips. It was Washington Graham that supported<pb n="266-267"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000125"/> her: Washington Graham, with all that high-bred
                  elegance of dress and manner, which distinguished him from all others. The waving
                  hair carelessly shading the brow of marble whiteness, the complexion, the air,
                  were Washington Graham's; but the dark, lustrous eyes, whose glance had so often
                  thrilled to her very soul, and which were now bent on her pale, bewildered
                  countenance, were the eyes of Rover.</p>
               <p>"Clara, dear Clara," cried he, "the hue of the gipsy, the garb of the pedler,
                  alone are wanting, but the faith of the lover, the vows of the bridegroom, remain.
                  Forgive the deception I have practised in concert with my romantic cousin here,
                  whose guardian genius has been constantly exerted in my behalf, to prove whether I
                  could be loved for myself alone."</p>
               <p>"Yes," added Gertrude, turning towards the company with inimitable grace, thus
                  diverting their attention from Clara's unconquerable emotion, "suffer me to finish
                  the explanation. I know all our friends are interested in hearing. My cousin came
                  hither, disgusted with recent proofs of the treachery of those who were attracted
                  towards him by the mere distinctions of wealth and fortune, and laying aside their
                  gaudy trappings, he assumed the disguise of a poor and lowly man."</p>
               <p>"But what upon earth made him think of passing off for a pedler?" exclaimed an old
                  lady, who had been rubbing her spectacles half a dozen times, to ascertain if she
                  could see distinctly. Every one smiled at the sudden interrogation.</p>
               <p>"I had written to him," rejoined Gertrude, "of Clara's history, and of her
                  invincible horror of the very name; and he, in the proud confidence of his own
                  unborrowed excellence, resolved to encounter the most obdurate prejudices, that he
                  might have the glory of conquering them. How he has succeeded, your own
                  congratulating hearts can now bear witness."</p>
               <p>"But I can't for my life think," continued the persevering old lady, "why she
                  didn't find him out. I know nobody would have deceived me in that way."</p>
               <p>Gertrude spoke in a low voice to Washington Graham, who, gently withdrawing from
                  the trembling hand that clung to his arm for support, smiled and left the
                  apartment. Clara followed him with her eyes, as if she feared he was about to
                  vanish like the phantasmagoria of a dream, and there was a dead pause in the whole
                  assembly. In a few minutes the door re-opened, and a young man appeared, dressed
                  in a plain suit of the darkest green, his hair combed in shading waves over his
                  darkened brow, his complexion tinged with the same gipsy dye—"Rover!" exclaimed
                  Clara, and sprang forward with a bound of irrepressible delight. Every remaining
                  doubt vanished, and she wept in the fullness of her joy.</p>
               <p>The old lady put on her spectacles, and looking close in his face, declared she
                  would never have known him from Adam—only there was a sort of a look out of the
                  eyes, that was like nobody else in the world but himself.</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6687-00000126"/>
               <p>There was now a general rush of congratulation towards Clara, and she was almost
                  smothered with caresses from those who, a few hours before, thought it would be a
                  disgrace to visit her again. The bride of Washington Graham was a very different
                  person from the bride of a pedler, but Clara's heart whispered that Rover and
                  Washington Graham were the same.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the lady of the spectacles, after the bridegroom had resumed his
                  character as Washington Graham, and the wedding was concluded, "I never saw any
                  thing like these Stanleys, for the luck that follows them; but I would not advise
                  any of the young folks to get such romantic notions into their heads, for all
                  that. Every old woman with a mob cap don't turn into a rich young widow, nor every
                  pedler into a fine gentleman."</p>

               <head>The Beauty Transformed.</head>
               <p>"CATHERINE," said young Meredith to his sister, as she was hastily passing him, on
                  the way to the drawing-room, "stop a moment, and let me speak with you."</p>
               <p>Catherine paused reluctlantly, for she was eager to welcome her expected
                  guest.</p>
               <p>"I have invited a friend here, to-night, to whom I wish you to be particularly
                  attentive."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Catherine; "is he very handsome, and rich, and fashionable? For he must
                  be either one or all, to make it an object for me to be particularly attentive to
                  him."</p>
               <p>"As to his beauty, I leave you to decide—men are no judges of each other's
                  beauty—I know not the extent of his wealth—but one thing I do know, I am under
                  obligations to him I never can repay."</p>
               <p>Catherine looked inquiringly, and Meredith proceeded:—</p>
               <p>"You remember my journey over the mountains last summer, the upsetting of the
                  carriage, my broken leg, my being detained so long in a log cabin, sick, and as
                  some thought, dying. Well, surely you recollect, Catherine, the young man, my
                  fellow traveller, who, though a stranger, lingered there with me, till I was in a
                  state of comparative ease, and watched over me like a guardian angel—I do believe,
                  under heaven, I owe my life to his tenderness and care—<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000127"/> what was my delight to meet him, unexpectedly, a
                  few hours since in the streets! I insisted upon his coming home with me,
                  immediately, but this his engagements would not permit. He promised, however, to
                  devote the evening to me, and I trust you will not forget the high claims he has
                  upon your gratitude and consideration."</p>
               <p>"To be sure I will not," answered Catherine. "I will be as polite as possible, for
                  I feel under infinite obligations to him, but as to entertaining him, I fear it
                  will be out of my power. I never know what to say to these very good pattern
                  people. I am sorry he happened to come to-night, as we expect so much company. It
                  is really unfortunate," said she, to herself, in a low voice, as she hurried into
                  the parlour, to greet, as she supposed, far more attractive and distinguished
                  guests, than her brother's grave and quiet nurse. She knew she ought to be very
                  grateful to him, but she imagined he must be a very dull companion, for Frank had
                  been comparatively dull since his acquaintance with him, and always quoted Mr.
                  Clifton, when he wished to support any argument in favour of morality, virtue, and
                  religion. She was tired of his name, for he was Frank's oracle, and
                     <emph>her</emph> oracles were among the gay and fashionable of the land.</p>
               <p>Frank and Catherine Meredith had neither father nor mother. An aunt, the widowed
                  sister of Mrs. Meredith, was at the head of the household establishment, and the
                  delegated guardian of Catherine's youth. Frank had been educated abroad, while
                  Catherine was placed in one of the most fashionable boarding schools in the
                  country. When the brother and sister met, after a separation of many years, in the
                  home of their youth, they were as strangers to each other. Each vainly sought to
                  read in the other's face and person, the image impressed on their juvenile memory.
                  The shy and somewhat awkward boy, had become the self-possessed and elegant young
                  man—the slender, pale, and stooping little girl, the graceful, well-proportioned,
                  and blooming young woman. They both appeared appropriate representatives of the
                  beings whose names they bore, and well fitted to adorn the station they were
                  destined to fill. Mr. and Mrs. Meredith were both devotees of wealth and fashion.
                  They had dedicated their children at the same altar, but being called away by
                  sudden disease, they could only bequeath to them their wealth and their example.
                  Mrs. Milner, their maternal aunt, stood in a mother's place to Catherine, and
                  believing, like her mother, that beauty, dress, and manners made up all that is
                  really desirable and lovely in woman, she resolved that Catherine should be a
                  model of perfection in these three grand essentials. Nature had furnished her with
                  the first, wealth with the second, and education the third. Frank was proud of his
                  sister, Mrs. Milner was proud of her niece—she was flattered, caressed, and
                  imitated. Is it strange that she should be vain? Frank left his sister with regret
                  to take the mountain journey mentioned above, and when he returned again after his
                  hair-breadth escape and protracted absence, she seemed more than ever endeared to
                     his<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6687-00000128"/> affections. But whether from the
                  consciousness of having escaped great danger from sickness, or the companionship
                  of Clifton, he was unaccountably changed, or, as Catherine declared, unaccountably
                     <emph>dull.</emph> She loved her brother, and felt bound by every moral
                  obligation to his friend, but he was the last person she wished to see. She felt
                  an internal conviction she should dislike <emph>him,</emph> and that he would
                  dislike <emph>her,</emph> and that his presence would be a restraint on her gaiety
                  and amusements. On this occasion she was dressed with unusual splendour. Mrs.
                  Milner, who always presided over the decorations of her toilet, with as much
                  gravity as a chief magistrate over the destinies of a nation, declared that
                  nothing was wanting to complete the elegance of her attire, very judiciously
                  adding, she had never seen her look half so beautiful, and that with such a face,
                  and such a dress, she might make a conquest of any heart she chose. Catherine
                  entered the room with a cheek flushed with the consciousness of beauty, and an eye
                  that sought in the glances of others the admiration, she doubted not, was her
                  spontaneous tribute. She was soon surrounded by a circle of flatterers, who so
                  completely engrossed her attention, she entirely forgot her brother and his
                  dreaded friend, and her spirits, elated by vanity, effervesced in the loud and
                  frequent laugh.</p>
               <p>"Who is that gentleman with your brother?" said one of her companions, as an
                  accidental opening in the group revealed him, standing directly opposite, with a
                  young man in black by his side, both apparently waiting for an opportunity to
                  approach her. The unmeaning laugh died on her lips. There was something in the
                  stranger's aspect that rebuked her frivolity, and shamed her into silence.</p>
               <p>"Can that be Mr. Clifton?" thought she. "How different from what I imagined he
                  would be!"</p>
               <p>The next moment her brother pressed forward alone, and drawing her arm through
                  his, whispered in her ear, "For mercy's sake, Catherine, leave those grinning
                  idiots, and try to appear like a sensible girl, the rest of the evening. I never
                  was so mortified in my life, that Clifton should see you for the first time to
                  such disadvantage. He is so very peculiar, so different from every other person,
                  and I am so desirous that you should please him."</p>
               <p>The heart of the vain and flattered Catherine rose rebellious at this speech.
                  Frank had never spoken so harshly to her before. She determined to show her
                  resentment by disregarding his injunctions, and when she received Mr. Clifton's
                  bow of introduction, her countenance expressed as plain as words could speak it,
                  "admire me as I am, for I will not change to please you or any individual in the
                  universe." Two moments after, she would have bartered all the incense she had been
                  so eagerly accepting, for the power to recall that haughty and ungracious look, so
                  ungratefully bestowed, yet so mildly received. "Frank is to blame for all," said
                  she to herself, trying to soothe her self-anger, by throwing the whole burthen on
                  him; "he always described him as a kind of hum-drum, prosing being. When I asked
                  him if he were handsome<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6687-00000129"/> some, he
                  answered me evasively, as if he were just not ugly. Men were no judges of each
                  other's beauty! As to wealth and fashion, he knew nothing about it!—as if any one
                  could be so graceful, who had not been educated in refinement and in the most
                  elegant society! And then, to crown the whole, for Frank to make me so angry at
                  the very moment when I ought to have been most amiable! Oh! that I had been more
                  on my guard!"</p>
               <p>Poor Frank was, as he had said, deeply mortified and disappointed. He was a great
                  believer in first impressions. He loved and venerated Clifton more than any other
                  human being. He knew there was much in Catherine's character, entirely uncongenial
                  to his own, but he relied on her beauty and attractive manners to disarm his
                  judgment, at first sight, and after that, he hoped miracles from the influence he
                  was sure Clifton would obtain over her mind. Never could he have beheld her under
                  circumstances more to her disadvantage, and Frank, who had been looking forward to
                  the moment when he should introduce his sister to his friend, as an era in his
                  existence, felt as if he could never forgive her the disappointment she had
                  caused. There was an embarrassing pause after the introduction. Frank, when alone
                  with Clifton, could talk with him for hours, unrestrainedly, but the fashionable
                  atmosphere he now breathed chilled the expression of his natural feelings, and he
                  knew Clifton would be disgusted with what was artificial. It was strange he had
                  never been sensible before of his sister's entire want of simplicity of character
                  racter. He forgot that he had always seen her surrounded by beings as artificial
                  as herself, and that now every look and action was seen through the medium in
                  which he fancied his friend beheld them. Catherine was not suffered long to remain
                  passive—she was solicited for music—"Are you fond of music, sir?" said she,
                  addressing Clifton, for the first time.</p>
               <p>"Extremely so," was his reply. The tone of his voice was singularly pleasing.
                  There was no laboured accent to give effect to his words.</p>
               <p>"Now, I shall charm him," thought Catherine, "in spite of all his gravity and
                  reserve, for no voice can compare with mine in compass, or brilliancy, and my
                  execution is declared to be unrivalled."</p>
               <p>When she was seated at the piano, Frank bent over her, under the pretence of
                  arranging the music, and whispered in her ear, "Play some of those fine marches,
                  but do not sing any of those foolish songs, you are accustomed to do. Not
                  to-night, for my sake."</p>
               <p>Catherine commenced a slow and beautiful march, not for his sake, but for the sake
                  of the handsome and cold-looking stranger, whose admiration she resolved to win.
                  She glanced her eye carelessly towards him, as she concluded, and she thought his
                  countenance was lighted up with pleasure, but she was vexed to see that he was
                  looking down, and she feared the soft expression she had thrown into her face,
                  while playing, had been lost upon him. "Oh, sing this song, Miss Meredith," "and
                  this," reiterated many voices, "the instrument is nothing without your
                  singing."</p>
               <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6687-00000130"/>
               <p>"I cannot sing to-night," said she; "I am hoarse—I have a bad cold."</p>
               <p>"Are you afraid of singing profane songs before the young parson?" said one, who
                  passed for a wit, in a low voice behind her.</p>
               <p>"Ridiculous!" exclaimed Catherine; "there is no young parson here."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! I thought the gentleman in black was one—and you have looked so grave and
                  solemn since his entrance, I imagined he had told you it was a sin to smile, and
                  perhaps to sing."</p>
               <p>He turned as he spoke to one of those vain, voluptuous, and unmeaning songs, to
                  which fashion sometimes sets its almost omnipotent seal. She had not the moral
                  courage to refuse, and urged by her dread of ridicule, and desire to show her
                  independence, she began in one of the sweetest and most melodious voices in the
                  world, strains which made Frank groan in spirit, and wish the piano in the bottom
                  of the sea. Intoxicated with the applause she received, she forgot her scruples,
                  and continued to sing and play—her aunt nodding and smiling at her, as she went
                  waving about the room, courting compliments for Catherine, that she might repeat
                  them to her, when the company had gone. When Catherine rose from the instrument
                  her brother and Mr. Clifton had disappeared. She looked in vain among the groups
                  of faces for that dark and serious eye, whose expression was a mystery to her
                  understanding. With mortified feelings she retired to her chamber, after the
                  company had dispersed, and placing the lights so as to shine with full
                  resplendence on a mirror, she took a long and deliberate survey of herself, before
                  she divested herself of her glittering ornaments. She compared herself in
                  imagination with all the bright forms which had recently beamed on her gaze, and
                  she could not but exult in her own pre-eminence. "I feared I had grown ugly," said
                  she, turning her beautiful profile towards the glass, after gazing on the full
                  reflection of her features, "<emph>he</emph> looked so cold and distant upon me.
                  If I have not appeared handsome to him, tonight, I can never hope to charm him,
                  for this dress is superb, and this bandeau of pearl, contrasts so finely with my
                  dark hair." She unbound her long shining hair, and as it hung in luxuriance around
                  her, the thought flashed into her mind, that Clifton might be an admirer of
                  simplicity, and she resolved to steal upon his senses the next time they met, in
                  all the sweetness of undecorated maiden loveliness. She would wear pure, virgin
                  white, her hair should fall in natural waves on her neck, she would look all that
                  was gentle and modest. It never entered into the heart of Catherine, that man
                  could be enslaved by any other charm than beauty, or that beauty, all radiant as
                  hers, could fail to captivate the being exposed to its influence. She had never
                  dreamed that an eye less bright might possess a holier charm, or a form less fair
                  inspire a deeper emotion. She had never been taught to think that there might be
                  something enshrined within, an indwelling beauty, an immortal principle, capable
                  of giving grace and lustre to features unattractive in themselves. From a child,
                     every<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6687-00000131"/> instruction she had received
                  seemed to have for the ultimate object, external attraction. She was excluded from
                  the sun and air, those "chartered libertines," lest they should add a deeper shade
                  to the roses and lilies of nature—her hands were kept imprisoned in gloves, to
                  preserve their snowy tints; she was not permitted to read or study by
                  candle-light, lest she should dim the starry brightness of her eyes, or to take
                  long walks, lest her feet should become enlarged by too much exercise.</p>
               <p>"Katy, my dear, don't run, it will make your complexion red—Katy, my love, don't
                  eat too much, it will make your complexion coarse."</p>
               <p>A thousand such admonitions as these were associated with the memory of her
                  mother, and never had her aunt suffered them to be forgotten for want of
                  reiteration. Mrs. Milner even exceeded her in the minuteness of her instructions.
                  She compelled her to wear a linen mask, during the long summer nights, to enhance
                  the delicacy of her skin, and to put on a deep bonnet, in her own room, whenever
                  she sat by an open window. Thus brought up from infancy in the worse than Egyptian
                  bondage of fashion, poor Catherine had no conception of the unfettered joys of
                  nature. When at school, she was confined within the walls of a city, and obliged
                  to submit to the iron rules of an ultrafashionable instructress. To do her
                  justice, she was a docile pupil, and graduated with all the honours of the
                  institution.</p>
               <p>Frank Meredith had accompanied Clifton to his own room, and sat with him long
                  after midnight. It seemed that Clifton possessed the master-key to his soul, for
                  it was only when he was alone with him, that he suffered his thoughts to flow out
                  unchecked, and expressed the desires and hopes that were struggling into existence
                  within his bosom.</p>
               <p>"Clifton," said he, "I have not lived since you parted from me; I have been
                  dragging on a joyless being, incapable of feeling sympathy, or imparting delight.
                  Catherine calls me dull and stupid, and so I am, but she knows not how vain and
                  valueless all my former pursuits now appear to me—she knows not with what loathing
                  I turn from the false pleasures she so eagerly pursues."</p>
               <p>"I know not," repeated Clifton, in a reproachful voice; "are you convinced
                  yourself that they are incapable of satisfying the vast desires of an immortal
                  mind, are you conscious of the fire of eternity burning within you, and can you
                  sit down in silence, and see your own and only sister endeavouring to quench what
                  is unquenchable, to destroy what is indestructible, without warning or rebuke?
                  Frank, I did hope better things of you."</p>
               <p>"I know I have been wrong," answered Frank, ingenuously, "but I want
                     <emph>your</emph> moral courage. A thousand times have I been on the point of
                  declaring to her all that has been passing in my heart; the reflections that were
                  awakened on my sick bed, the influence of your example and conversation, but I
                  have always been interrupted by some vanity in the shape of dress, or my good
                  aunt, or some fashionable dangler—I never could find the favourable moment—and
                     though<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6687-00000132"/> I can feel, deeply, keenly
                  feel, I cannot find language to give utterance to my thoughts. Catherine would
                  call me crazy if I should tell her what is passing within me, when she deems me
                  merely listless and unoccupied. To tell the truth, I have not dared to contend
                  with the unhallowed influences around her, while I become more and more angry to
                  see her yielding to their power. Yet, believe me, Clifton, she is not so vain and
                  foolish as she forced you to think her this night. Nature intended her for
                  something better than a <emph>mere</emph> belle."</p>
               <p>"Your sister is beautiful," said Clifton, "beautiful and young, and greatly to be
                  pitied. I could have wept to see her adorned like a victim to be sacrified on the
                  altar of a godless world—I thought of my own sister—as fair, and oh! how much more
                  lovely, whom three months since I consigned to the dust, and I asked myself, what
                  hope or consolation would be my portion now, if the bloom of <emph>her</emph>
                  youth had been wasted in scenes like these. She died in her sixteenth spring—she
                  died in my arms, with the smile of rapture on her pallid lips, and anticipated
                  glory gleaming from her closing eye." Clifton paused and looked upward with a
                  heavenly expression, then turning towards Frank with an earnest and fervent
                  manner, "Do you love your sister?"</p>
               <p>"Better than any thing in this world, except yourself."</p>
               <p>"And with this love, then, glowing in your heart, and believing as you do, in the
                  existence of that eternal world, of which she has scarcely been allowed to dream,
                  convinced of her accountability to God, for all the gifts he has bestowed, an
                  accountability which has never been impressed on <emph>her</emph> conscience, what
                  would be your reflections if you saw her struck down by the angel of death, even
                  as my sweet and blooming Jane, conscious that you had never even whispered in her
                  ear—'This is not all, my sister—this bright, but shadowy scene—eternity's
                  beyond!'"—</p>
               <p>"Clifton," said Frank, impetuously, "you have saved my life—I know I should have
                  died on the mountains, when that burning fever was drying up my veins, if you had
                  not watched over me with more than woman's tenderness. But this is not half the
                  debt. You roused my mind from its long and deadly lethargy, and it has ever since
                  been heaving and struggling for that glorious liberty of the children of God, you
                  taught me to pant after. But I am not yet free—I am too weak to help others break
                  their bonds. Do this for me, and I will bless you. Come and remain with us, and be
                  our Mentor and our guide. Catherine is scarcely more a devotee of the world than I
                  was, when first you knew me. Be not afraid of coming in contact with vice and
                  folly—we must sometimes handle the dross of earth, to extract its gold. You will
                  not be contaminated, and we shall be purified."</p>
               <p>"It pains me, my friend," replied Clifton, "that you should ascribe a power to me
                  that belongs to God alone. If I have been instrumental in his hands of exciting in
                  you a thirst for living waters, give thanks to Him from whom those living waters
                  flow—I am<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6687-00000133"/> but a fellow-pilgrim with
                  you, through the wilderness of life, and having, like you, drank deep of the
                  feverish streams of pleasure, and found them unsatisfying, I have been directed to
                  a pure and purifying fountain, and I could but ask you to taste and live."</p>
               <p>Clifton could not be persuaded to make the house of his friend his home, but he
                  consented to remain near him, for a time, and to visit him, as often as he could
                  be assured of finding him at liberty to act as a <emph>rational being.</emph> He
                  promised, too, to converse with Catherine, as a rational and immortal being, and
                  to persevere in the task, though he might meet with displeasure and disgust from
                  her. It was a novel task, indeed, to be imposed on a young and handsome man, to
                  tell a flattered beauty of her faults instead of offering incense to her vanity,
                  but the rays of Catherine's beauty fell as coldly on Clifton's eye, as the
                  sunbeams reflected from a sheet of polar ice—as he had told her brother, he looked
                  upon her with the sincerest pity for her own sake, and with sentiments more tender
                  for his, for his soul clave unto Frank's, even as Jonathan's unto David, "with a
                  love passing the love of woman." It was a love that stretched far beyond the
                  limits of time, and followed its object through the unwasting ages of
                  eternity.</p>
               <p>Catherine adopted the plan of elegant simplicity she had previously arranged, and
                  appeared without any ornament but a single white rose, wreathed in her dark locks.
                  But with all her practised graces, and determination to be admired, she found it
                  impossible to preserve with Clifton those artificial manners for which she had
                  been so much applauded. His graceful gravity checked the affected laugh, which so
                  often rung without merriment. Whenever she met his mild, serious, yet deeply
                  penetrating eye, she forgot to add a languishing softness, or sparkling brilliancy
                  to her own. Absorbed in the contemplation of his singular and to her mysterious
                  character, she, for almost the first time in her life, forgot herself, and looked
                  and moved as nature prompted. As she listened to his conversation, so superior in
                  intellect to what she was accustomed to hear, she felt ashamed that, instead of
                  cultivating her powers of reason and expression, she had aimed at nothing higher
                  than brilliant nonsense.</p>
               <p>One evening she walked in the garden with Clifton and her brother, for it was
                  sunset, and Mrs. Milner thought at that hour she might venture in the air with
                  impunity. Clifton was an enthusiast, when speaking of the beauties of nature, and
                  he never spoke of a tree or flower, without leading the thoughts to the divine
                  mysteries of creation, and endeavouring to raise them to their great and glorious
                  Author. Catherine was a skilful botanist, but here was a lore in which she was
                  altogether unlearned. When she accompanied them in their walk, she thought to
                  herself, "Now shall I have an opportunity of shining," but when Clifton began to
                  speak of the beauties to which she directed his gaze, he soared so far beyond the
                  limits of her capacities, she felt as if she were left grovelling behind. Frank
                  gathered a beautiful rose, and gave his sister as they passed the bush on which<pb
                     n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6687-00000134"/> it was blossoming. She took it with a
                  smile, and was about to place it in her bosom—"Oh, my God!" she passionately
                  exclaimed, suddenly dropping the flower. A thorn had pierced her finger, and the
                  blood stained its snowy surface.</p>
               <p>Clifton started and a flush passed over his face. He turned towards her, but not
                  to sympathize in so trivial an accident: "Miss Meredith," said he, "forgive me, if
                  I speak with a plainness you are not wont to hear. It is inexpressibly painful to
                  me, to hear the most holy and august name in the universe uttered irreverently.
                  Even in prayer, I cannot breathe it, without melting with tenderness or trembling
                  with awe."</p>
               <p>Catherine turned pale at the solemnity of the rebuke, then reddened with anger,
                  shame and astonishment, till, at length, unable to control her excited feelings,
                  tears she could not hide gushed from her eyes.</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to wound," said he; "forgive me, I ask once again, if I have
                  spoken too harshly. But believe me, I address you as a friend, less flattering,
                  perhaps, than many who bear that name, but more sincere. Angels rejoice when the
                  lips of beauty unite with them in strains of adoration and praise of the source of
                  uncreated glory, but angels weep, if beatified beings can weep, when youth and
                  beauty live regardless of the high, the undeniable claims of their Maker on their
                  soul."</p>
               <p>There was an earnestness, a tenderness in his voice and manner, that disarmed her
                  resentment, but as her anger died away, her tears flowed more freely. "You are
                  very, very solemn, Mr. Clifton," said she; "I spoke thoughtlessly; I know, I am
                  too apt to do so; but I little dreamed I was giving <emph>you</emph> pain."</p>
               <p>Frank felt for the distress of his sister, though he was delighted at her
                  unexpected sensibility. He drew her arm through his, and leading her towards the
                  summer-house, entreated Clifton to take advantage of the present calm and
                  uninterrupted moment and converse with them both as if he were addressing a
                  brother or a sister.</p>
               <p>"A sister!" repeated Clifton; the words touched the chords of memory; "Miss
                  Meredith, shall I speak to you of a sister, who was unutterably dear to my
                  affections? who, one year since, was blooming in health as you now are, but who
                  now sleeps in death? You say I am very solemn, and I now choose a solemn theme,
                  but to me it is a delightful one, a glorious one."</p>
               <p>Catherine shuddered. Death was associated in her mind with images of darkness and
                  horror, for she thought only of the body returning to dust, consigned to
                  corruption and the worm, not of the soul ascending to the God who gave it. It was
                  an awful subject to her, yet she felt a curiosity, restrained by fear, to know how
                  his young sister had met the conqueror's coming.</p>
               <p>"Glorious!" exclaimed she—"oh! it must be terrible!"</p>
               <p>"Death had no terrors for her," replied he, "though he came to her in the
                  spring-time of her youth. She welcomed him as a messenger from God, whom she<pb
                     n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6687-00000135"/> loved as a reconciled Father, and laid
                  her head on his cold bosom as gently as if she were reclining on a pillow of down.
                  Do you ask me what it was that made her dying hour a scene of such holy
                  tranquillity? It was faith in Him who had died to redeem her, who had himself
                  passed through the portals of the tomb, and left behind him a long track of glory.
                  'I know that my Redeemer liveth,' were the last words she uttered, and had you
                  seen the seraphic expression of her eye and the smile that lingered on her lips
                  even after the spirit had departed, you would have felt with me the reality, the
                  beauty, the grandeur of religion."</p>
               <p>Catherine listened and wondered. The rays of the crimsoned west were reflected on
                  the face of Clifton, through the parting boughs that shaded the window of the
                  summer-house. Its usually pale hue was lighted up with a fervent glow, and his
                  eyes beamed as she thought with more than earthly fire. And yet he was speaking of
                     <emph>death,</emph> a subject, the mere mention of which never failed to blanch
                  the roses of her cheek and freeze her blood with horror.</p>
               <p>"Religion," thought she, "what is religion? Does it consist in such a life as
                  mine? In dressing, shining, practising to be admired, in living but for flattery
                  and display, in a life of idleness and dissipation?"</p>
               <p>Thus Catherine's awakened conscience interrogated her when she retired to the
                  solitude of her chamber, and a still, small voice within gave back the faithful
                  negative. Lost in her new reflections, she did not notice the entrance of a
                  servant who came loaded with band-boxes, sent by the milliner and mantua-maker,
                  containing articles for which she had been impatiently waiting. Mrs. Milner, who
                  always followed these arrivals, and who never moved without a bustle, roused her
                  from her reverie.</p>
               <p>"Why, Catherine, my love," said she, "what is the matter, that you seem so
                  indifferent about these beautiful dresses? You have been crying—spoiling your eyes
                  and complexion—I know it by the red circle round them—what can be the matter? You
                  have been moping these two or three days—ever since that Clifton has been here,
                  and a most disagreeable young man he is, I am sure."</p>
               <p>"Disagreeable, aunt," repeated Catherine, with some warmth.</p>
               <p>"Yes, exceedingly so," replied Mrs. Milner; "he has not said a civil thing to you
                  yet. It was kind in him to take care of Frank, when he was sick, and that is the
                  only reason I tolerate him. I can't bear people who look as if they thought
                  themselves so much better than other folks. He does not take any more notice of
                  you than if you were his grandmother. I hope it is not that which makes you low
                  spirited."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed," said Catherine, her vanity, which had slumbered for a little while,
                  piqued at the remark; "I do not care for his attention, but I am sure he is polite
                  and kind. He has been speaking to me of his sister, a beautiful young girl, who
                  died a short time since, and it was impossible not to be affected by the manner in
                  which he described her death."</p>
               <p>"I do not see the use of his talking to you about<pb n="288-289"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000136"/> these things," answered Mrs. Milner with some
                  asperity; "it only serves to damp one's spirits, and does no good to any one—I
                  always avoid them myself."</p>
               <p>"But, aunt," said Catherine, "shall we not be obliged to think of them sometimes?
                  If we must die ourselves—"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense," interrupted Mrs. Milner. "I will not hear you talk in that gloomy
                  strain. We ought to enjoy ourselves as much as possible in this world, and not
                  trouble ourselves about leaving it till the time comes. Look at this superb dress.
                  There is not another pattern in town—you must wear it to-morrow evening at Mrs.
                  R.'s, for there is to be a splendid party there."</p>
               <p>She unfolded the robe, richly ornamented with lace and novel decorations, before
                  Catherine, whose eyes began to sparkle, as they were wont to do, in the
                  contemplation of her finery, long and early acquired habits of vanity and love of
                  admiration triumphing over the better feelings that were beginning to struggle in
                  her heart. That night her thoughts were strange and confused. She tried in vain to
                  sleep—at one moment the deep-toned voice of Clifton seemed ringing in her ears,
                  rebuking her profane levity; at another the shrouded form of his once blooming
                  sister, rose pale and cold before her shuddering gaze; then the glittering image
                  of herself in her new attire, the centre of an admiring crowd, came dazzlingly
                  over the shadows of the tomb. Over all there brooded one overwhelming idea, which
                  once admitted, she could not shut out, that though she had lived an atheist's
                  life, there was indeed a God from whose presence and whose power she could not
                  flee. The breathing silence of the night, its sweeping shadows, through which the
                  stars were gleaming like the myriad eyes of omniscience, the lonely voice of the
                  wind sighing through the trees, deepened the awe that oppressed her soul. Mrs.
                  Milner rebuked her in the morning for her pale complexion, and insisted upon
                  treating her as an invalid, and confining her to her room. By this means she hoped
                  to keep her from the society of Clifton, whose influence she dreaded more than she
                  was willing to acknowledge. She thought her, however, sufficiently recovered in
                  the evening, to attend the party at Mrs. R.'s, for which splendid preparations had
                  been long making. Catherine did not devote as much time as she was wont to do, in
                  decorating her person, but her aunt supplied the deficiency, by over zeal on her
                  part. She twisted and untwisted her hair, curled and uncurled it, waved and
                  braided it, till Catherine declared her head ached and she would rather go as she
                  was than be tortured any longer. She was beginning to think there was an
                     <emph>interior</emph> to her head, which had been left to shameful neglect and
                  poverty, while costly gems, and time, than gems more precious, had been constantly
                  lavished on the <emph>exterior.</emph> Catherine received that evening a lesson
                  she little expected, and it was not the less salutary. After playing and singing
                  for the gratification of the company, and being complimented and admired as usual,
                  she began to be weary. She felt a void unfelt before. She looked on the young men
                  who surrounded her, and thought how they sunk into<pb n="290-291"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000137"/> insignificance, even in personal comparison with
                  Clifton, to say nothing of his lofty intellect, his pure and spiritual
                  conversation. Every thing that was said to her sounded silly and vapid. She wanted
                  to be alone, and taking advantage of a moment, when a new singer was engaging
                  general attention, she retired into the piazza, where the beauty of the night had
                  already attracted many of the guests. She stood a moment in the shade without
                  being perceived, quite near a young gentleman and lady who were engaged in earnest
                  conversation. She had no intention of acting the part of a listener, but hearing
                  her own name, she involuntarily held her breath that she might not lose the
                  accompanying words. The gentleman was one of her professed admirers, the young
                  lady one of her warmest professing friends.</p>
               <p>"You have been saying all these fine things before to Catherine Meredith," said
                  the young lady; "you are the professed worshipper of her beauty. Why attempt to
                  lay offerings at a meaner shrine?"</p>
               <p>"Catherine Meredith," repeated he, emphatically; "why it is the fashion to admire
                     <emph>her,</emph> and her vanity is so excessive and so exacting, it is
                  impossible for a young man to be in her presence, without being forced to pay
                  tribute to it. And then her vain, foolish aunt, taxing every one's admiration for
                  Catherine, and compelling them to declare her a super-angelic being!"</p>
               <p>"But surely you think her handsome?" asked the young girl, in a delighted voice.
                  "I never thought her so myself, but feared to confess it, lest I should be accused
                  of envy."</p>
               <p>"Yes, rather handsome," was the reply, "but nothing to excite interest. She
                  reminds me of Moore's description of that beauty unchangeably bright which
                  annihilates love, with its own dazzling excess.—Oh! no.—I flatter her, it is true,
                  for it amuses me, but neither she, nor fifty thousand such as she, could ever
                  touch my heart."</p>
               <p>Here something was added in a lower voice, something probably meant for her
                  exclusive ear, and they passed on into the moonlight, leaving Catherine first
                  petrified with astonishment, and then glowing with indignation.</p>
               <p>"Are these," thought she, "the friends in whose sincerity I have confided, to
                  whose professions I have lent a charmed and willing ear?"</p>
               <p>Bitter was the pang to find herself an object of ridicule and contempt, where she
                  believed she was almost worshipped. Unused to self-control, and too proud to
                  suffer her feelings to be visible to those who would triumph in her mortification,
                  she complained of a violent headache to her aunt, and induced her to return home.
                  The same young man pressed forward to assist her into the carriage, with that
                  devoted admiring air he always assumed, but Catherine, giving him an inexplicable
                  look, coldly declined the offered civility, to the great astonishment and
                  displeasure of her aunt.</p>
               <p>"You are very strange to-night, Catherine," said Mrs. Milner. "I thought Mr. ——
                  was a great favourite of yours."</p>
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6687-00000138"/>
               <p>"I hate him, I detest him," cried she. "I never wish to hear his name mentioned in
                  my presence."</p>
               <p>Her long-repressed feelings here burst forth, and throwing herself back in the
                  carriage, she wept the bitterest tears she had ever shed in her life. Wounded
                  pride, mortified vanity, envy, jealousy, and anger, raged like a whirlwind in her
                  bosom. It was long before she would explain to her aunt the cause of her
                  mysterious agitation, and when she did so, the violence of Mrs. Milner's
                  indignation swept away Catherine's in its stronger current. She exhausted herself
                  in giving vent to her anger, and retired to her room in a state bordering on
                  hysterics. As Catherine crossed the gallery that led to her chamber, the servant
                  who lighted her, begged her to stop and speak to a little girl, who seemed in
                  great distress about her mother, and had been there once before, during their
                  absence. She had just made an appeal in her behalf to Mrs. Milner, but in vain—she
                  was too much engrossed with her own imagined wrongs. Catherine was precisely in
                  that state of mind when she was rejoiced to be carried away from herself. She
                  turned to the child, and bade her make known her wants. The little girl came
                  forward, trembling and weeping, and in a few simple words declared her errand. Her
                  mother was poor, very poor, who lived in a little alley not far distant. She
                  supported herself by her daily labour, and two or three little children, whom she
                  left at home during the day, and to whom she returned at night, with the wages she
                  had earned. This night she had returned very ill and laid down in her bed, without
                  speaking. The eldest of the little girls, whose name was Nelly, ran over to beg
                  one of the servants of Mrs. Milner to come to her mother's assistance, for she was
                  afraid she was going to die. "There was a good gentleman here," said Nelly, "who
                  told me he would send her a doctor, but I am afraid to be left with mother, and
                  brother and sister are <emph>littleer</emph> than I."</p>
               <p>Catherine thought there was but one good gentleman in the world, and that was
                  Clifton. The tears of the little girl affected her surprisingly. "It is but a few
                  steps," said she, "and the moon is shining brightly, I will go with you myself,
                  and see what can be done for your mother."</p>
               <p>Then telling Nelly to lead the way, she bade the astonished waiting-maid follow,
                  and set out, for the first time in her life, for the abode of poverty, sickness,
                  and perhaps of death. With nothing but a light scarf thrown over her splendid
                  dress, she glided through the alternate shadows and moonbeams, by the side of the
                  miserable child, like one of those bright genii, described in oriental tales. She
                  was hardly conscious of the impulse that led her on. She was greatly excited, and
                  having read one lesson of the world's vanity, she felt a feverish desire to peruse
                  another, in a far different scene. It was not till she reached the door of the
                  low, wretched dwelling, she was sensible of the extraordinary situation in which
                  she had placed herself. Nelly softly lifted the latch, and held the door for
                  Catherine to pass in, with that courtesy which nature sometimes teaches the
                     humblest<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6687-00000139"/> of its children. Catherine
                  paused upon the threshold, for she felt that she was treading on holy ground. A
                  voice, too, reached her ear, whose tones breathed of the tranquillity of heaven. A
                  single lamp, placed on a low table near the bed, dimly lighted up the apartment,
                  and revealed to the appalled view of Catherine, the livid countenance of the
                  apparently dying woman. She lay extended on a straw pallet, rigid and motionless,
                  with no symptoms of life about her, but an occasional wild rolling of the eyes,
                  which were of a livid black, and contrasted fearfully with her ashy complexion.
                  Two little, pale, terrified-looking children crouched near the foot of the bed,
                  and kneeling by its side, was a figure which Catherine thought she would have
                  recognised in the most distant isle of the ocean. It was Clifton, who, like his
                  divine Master, made it his business to go about, binding up the wounds of sorrow
                  and sin, and soothing the evils of suffering humanity. He had sent a physician,
                  who had but just left the cabin, but he came himself, to see if he could not
                  minister comfort and give counsel to the soul of the invalid. He found her in that
                  condition, when it is impossible for man to tell what is passing between the
                  spirit and the mighty God into whose presence it is about to appear, and kneeling
                  down, he commended her to Him in whose sight the dweller of the mud-walled cottage
                  and the inmate of the palace are equal.</p>
               <p>Catherine held her breath, as that solemn, fervent, thrilling prayer rose like
                  incense above the couch of death. He was not aware of her presence. He remembered
                  membered only the presence of the omnipotent Jehovah, and the poor sufferer, for
                  whom he was interceding, and by this simple, yet sublime act of faith and devotion
                  he transformed that miserable apartment into a scene of grandeur and of glory.
                  When Clifton rose from his knees, Nelly, who had stood in mute awe by the side of
                  Catherine, approached her mother, and took hold of the hand, which was no longer
                  conscious of her touch. Catherine followed, trembling and bewildered, and
                  encountered the wondering gaze of Clifton, who turned round at the footsteps of
                  the child. The lamp flashed up at this moment, and reflected its rays full on
                  Catherine's glittering figure, so strangely contrasting with the poverty and gloom
                  of the place. The dying woman seemed to be roused by the gleam, and opening her
                  eyes once more, fixed them upon Catherine with such a wild, unearthly glare, she
                  could scarcely repress the scream of terror that rose to her lips.</p>
               <p>Clifton drew near Catherine. "You had better return," said he; "you cannot relieve
                  her, for she is beyond all human aid. Take these poor orphans with you, and give
                  them shelter for the night. Let your attendant remain here. I will see you safely
                  home, and then return, and keep watch with her while life lasts."</p>
               <p>"Can I do nothing to assist you?" asked Catherine, ashamed of her helplessness and
                  her fears.</p>
               <p>"There is nothing to be done," replied he, "but I rejoice that you have been led
                  here for your own sake. This scene needs no comments. It is awful, but
                  chastening."</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6687-00000140"/>
               <p>Here a deep groan from the bed made Catherine start and shudder, and Clifton
                  pitying her agitation, took her hand and drew her gently away. The children sobbed
                  and clung to the bedside of their mother, refusing to leave her, and Clifton
                  thinking it kinder to indulge their feelings than to force them, suffered them to
                  remain behind. When they came into the open air, and saw the pure and blessed moon
                  shining above, Catherine felt as if she were emerging into more celestial regions
                  than she had ever inhabited before. A sixth sense seemed to have been imparted to
                  her, whereby the glory of God was revealed to her soul. The heavens no longer
                  appeared to her a mere expanse of starry blue, made to gratify man's nightly
                  vision, or to exercise the genius of the astronomer, but a tablet on which was
                  impressed in burning and eternal characters, the wisdom, the power, the infinity
                  of the creating uncreated hand. The shadows of death were left rolling behind,
                  forming a dark background for these living splendours. The consciousness that she
                  had something existing within her, destined to live when the moon, and the stars,
                  and the heavens themselves were no more, swelled in her bosom, and oppressed while
                  it exalted her. When Clifton parted with her at her own door, he simply said, "May
                  God bless you, Miss Meredith." The words were few, but every thing that was kind
                  and feeling was expressed in the deep and heartfelt sincerity of the tones.
                  Catherine could not sleep, through the long watches of the night. How much had she
                  learned during the past hours of the treachery, the falsehood, the vanity of the
                  world! She reflected with shame and remorse on the stormy passions that had been
                  excited in her breast. They had all subsided in the chill, still atmosphere of
                  death. The beauty which she had lived to adorn and display seemed now worthless in
                  her eyes, doomed as it was to turn to dust and ashes, while the deathless
                  principle which had been slumbering under the influence of such fatal opiates, now
                  awakened and rose upon the ruins of demolished vanity and pride, with supernatural
                  energy.</p>
               <p>The woman died a few hours after Catherine left her. Her first thought when she
                  heard the intelligence was for the destitute orphans. She knew they had a friend
                  in Clifton, but she wanted to aid him in this labour of love. Her only difficulty
                  was in breaking the matter to her aunt, and in gaining her consent and
                  co-operation. Frank unfortunately was absent, who would have assisted her in this
                  extremity, and though with some misgivings, she entered upon her explanation. Mrs.
                  Milner was aghast with horror, when she learned that Catherine herself had
                  breathed infected air, had stood by the bed of death, and perhaps exposed herself
                  and the family to some loathsome disease. She called for camphor, lavender, and
                  cologne, and insisted upon Catherine's bathing herself in the odorous waters, as
                  many times as the proud leper was commanded to wash in the waves of Jordan. The
                  children—she would not hear of them. They might bring distemper with them; there
                  was an orphan asylum in which they could be placed. She was<pb n="298-299"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000141"/> going to make immediate preparations to leave the
                  town, and visit some watering place, where they would be secure from contagion.
                  Baffled in her benevolent wishes, Catherine entreated Clifton to find a home for
                  the orphans, on the condition that she should be allowed to defray all expenses
                  connected with the charge. This Clifton did not resist, for he knew it would flow
                  back in blessings on herself.</p>
               <p>A pious and respectable widow consented to receive them, and Catherine never
                  forgot her proteges. Mrs. Milner's alarm did not subside, and another motive,
                  unavowed, induced her to hasten her departure, her anxiety to remove Catherine
                  from the influence of Clifton. Her anger, too, at the occurrence which took place
                  at the party, accelerated her movements. Catherine saw with dismay the
                  arrangements for their speedy removal from the society of one, whom she now
                  regarded as her best counsellor, and truest friend. Frank openly resisted the
                  plan, but finding it in vain to alter his aunt's determination, he urged Clifton
                  to accompany them, with all the eloquence of which he was master. "I cannot go
                  with you," replied he; here Mrs. Milner breathed freely, "but I will endeavour to
                  follow," here her brow again clouded, while Catherine's brightened as if a sunbeam
                  flashed over it. They were to commence their journey early in the morning—Clifton
                  lingered till a late hour in the evening. He spoke to Catherine with all the
                  freedom and tenderness of a brother, and at her own request sketched the outline
                  of his sainted sister's character and life, for Catherine resolved in her heart
                  she would make them the model of her own. She no longer thought it a gloomy
                  theme—she could even hear him speak of death without shuddering, for she began to
                  perceive beyond its shadows, the dawn of an eternal day.</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Mrs. Milner, as the carriage rolled away from the door, and
                  the last glimpse of Clifton's figure was excluded from their view.</p>
               <p>"For what?" asked Frank, abruptly.</p>
               <p>"For being relieved of the company of that young man. He has changed you and
                  Catherine into perfect mopes, and me, too, almost—I really have not felt well
                  since he came among us."</p>
               <p>Catherine either could not or would not speak. She sat veiled in a corner of the
                  carriage, and turned not at the voice of her aunt. Not so Frank—he could not hear
                  Clifton lightly named.</p>
               <p>"Aunt," said he, warmly, "there is more real worth in one joint of Clifton's
                  little finger, than in all the young men you ever knew in your whole existence. He
                  is truth to his heart's core. He would sacrifice his life for his enemy—more he
                  could not do for a friend. Mopes! I never knew one hour of real happiness till I
                  knew him, nor Catherine either, I am confident, though she may not be bold enough
                  to declare it."</p>
               <p>"Well, Frank," replied she, angrily, "I will not say more now, as you are so warm,
                  but I never wish to see him again as long as I live."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not, my dear aunt, but when you come<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000142"/> to die, you may wish in vain for such a friend as
                  Clifton."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Milner looked as if she thought that hour was far distant; but in such an
                  hour as we think not, "the Son of Man cometh." She awoke that night with a violent
                  pain in her head, and a burning thirst, accompanied by indescribable and alarming
                  sensations. She had fled precipitately from disease, but it pursued her like a
                  strong man armed, and she now lay powerless in its grasp. As a traveller she was
                  deprived of the comforts of home, and was compelled to employ as a physician, a
                  stranger, in whose skill she had no confidence. Catherine was terrified. She had
                  never seen her aunt sick in her life. She had lived as if she expected immortality
                  on earth. It was a melancholy thing to see her prostrated so suddenly on a sick
                  bed. She insisted upon going home immediately. She would be well as soon as she
                  returned, she was sure, but the moment she lifted her head from the pillow, her
                  brain reeled and her limbs refused their office. In a few hours she was raving in
                  delirium, and the physician declared her life in the utmost danger. Messengers
                  were dispatched for her medical friends, but before they arrived, she was on the
                  verge of eternity, and no human hand could hold her back from the awful abyss in
                  which she was about to plunge. It was a fearful thing to hear her raving about
                  fashion and fine dresses, and Catherine's beauty, thus weaving of vanity a
                  winding-sheet for her soul, the grave-clothes which it must wear into the presence
                  of a holy God.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Catherine, as she hung in agony over her bed, "oh, that Clifton
                  were here, that he might breathe one such prayer over her as I heard him breathe
                  over that poor, dying woman!"</p>
               <p>"My sister," said Frank, "let us kneel together, and pray that Clifton's God may
                  be ours. The voice of prayer cannot reach her ear, but it will be heard by Him
                  whose mercy is equal to his power."</p>
               <p>It was a touching sight to see that brother and sister kneeling by the dying bed
                  of her who had never instilled into their young hearts one principle of religion,
                  who had dedicated them to the God of this world, totally regardless of another,
                  and who had never lifted one prayer for herself or them, but had risen up and laid
                  down like the beasts that perish, to eat, to drink, to sleep, and then to die.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Milner died. No ray of reason broke in on her departing soul—no consolation
                  remained for her weeping friends. The last words she uttered rung in Catherine's
                  ear, long after her body was mouldering in the grave. "Take it back," said she,
                  after having given directions for a new dress in the latest style, "take it back,
                  it is old-fashioned, and stiff. It does not fit me. The chamber is narrow, and the
                  robe must be tight. The folds must lay close and smooth, and take care the dust
                  does not soil it. It looks wondrous white." White indeed was the last robe she
                  wore, and the folds once laid, they never moved again.</p>
               <p>To avoid details too minute for the limits of a story like this, we will pass over
                  the interval of a<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6687-00000143"/> year, and introduce
                  Catherine Meredith once more to our readers in her own home, which was to be her
                  home no longer. Owing to the boundless extravagance of Mrs. Milner, who proved so
                  faithless a guardian to the trust imposed, Catherine's fortune was completely
                  exhausted, and Frank found when he had cancelled every debt, he had scarcely
                  enough left for a support. The splendid house of their father was given up, and
                  they were about to remove to a small cottage in the country, where Frank intended
                  to prepare himself for the ministry, and Catherine to engage in the instruction of
                  youth. Catherine sat alone in the spacious apartment, which had been so often
                  thronged with gay and flattering guests. She was dressed in simple mourning, and
                  her hair parted on her brow, without ringlets or ornaments. Her cheek was pale,
                  and her eye more thoughtful than in her days of vanity, but "that peace which
                  passeth all understanding" now beamed from her countenance, and pervaded her
                  heart. True, she felt some natural regrets at leaving the home of her childhood,
                  where every object was endeared to her juvenile memory. She sat down to the piano,
                  and touched the keys for the last time. She began a hymn that Clifton had taught
                  her, but overcome by her feelings, she paused, and leaning her face on the
                  instrument, tears fell thick and fast upon the keys, which had so many times
                  responded to her flying fingers. The door opened, but she did not raise her head.
                  She thought she knew her brother's footsteps. Some one sat down by her side, but
                  still she moved not, for assured of Frank's affectionate sympathy, she was not
                  ashamed of her emotion. Her hand was gently taken, and she withdrew it not,
                  believing it the same fraternal hand which had always soothed her sorrows, and
                  wiped away her tears. "Catherine," said a voice, as kind and tender, but far
                  different from Frank's. It was Clifton, the brother of her adoption, and from this
                  moment, the destiny of Catherine was changed. She was told that she was loved by
                  one whom she revered as the best and holiest of created beings, as her guide to
                  heaven, her counsellor and consoler on earth. Catherine, in the true humility of
                  her heart, believed herself unworthy of his love, but she doubted not his
                  sincerity, and she lifted up her heart in gratitude to heaven for having provided
                  her with a friend so dear. Clifton had not stood aloof from them, during the year
                  which had flown by. Many a time previous to this hour, his heart had yearned to
                  pour forth the tenderness that filled it to overflowing, but he feared the change
                  in Catherine's character might be rather the result of feeling than principle, and
                  that she might relapse again into her former habits of self-indulgence and folly.
                  Now, however, when he saw her continuing in the narrow path of duty with
                  undeviating steps, unmoved by the ridicule of her former associates, preparing
                  herself for a life of exertion and self-denial, with more than resignation, with
                  energy and cheerfulness; he felt that he could take her by the hand, and bind her
                  to his heart with indissoluble ties—ties which death could not sever, and eternity
                  would more closely unite.</p>
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6687-00000144"/>
               <p>"Did you know that Catherine Meredith was married this morning to that
                  methodistical young man?" asked one of Catherine's former associates of another.
                  "I always thought it would be a match, for the poor girl almost run crazy after
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Well, I wish her joy," answered the other. "I am sure no one envies her. They say
                  he is very poor and exceedingly penurious. I know well enough she will get tired
                  of her conventicle life—such a proud, vain flirt as she used to be, is not changed
                  so soon. It is all hypocrisy. She put on religion, as she would put on a new
                  dress, to catch her husband, and she will put it off as readily, when it suits her
                  convenience."</p>
               <p>"And what do you think," observed the first speaker, "of her handsome brother
                  Frank? They say he is going to turn a preacher since he has lost his property.
                  Poor Mrs. Milner little thought, when she died, of such a downfall to her hopes. I
                  believe she thought Catherine might have married any prince in Europe. She was an
                  excellent woman, after all—gave such elegant parties;—she was a great loss to
                  society."</p>
               <p>So the heartless world spoke of the future prospects of those who had withdrawn
                  from its unhallowed influence. Let us follow Catherine for one moment to her new
                  home, and see whether she is wedded to penury and avarice. The last light of day,
                  that softened yet glowing light, which allows the eye to dwell undazzled on the
                  loveliness of nature, was lingering on the landscape. The richness and maturity of
                  latent summer mellowed the tints, but no trace of autumnal decay yet marked the
                  magnificent garniture of the fields and bowers. The bridal travellers were
                  ascending a gradual slope, from which the prospect every moment expanded into
                  deeper loveliness, when Catherine's eye was attracted by a white mansion, gleaming
                  through overshadowing trees, in classic beauty and simplicity, situated remote
                  from the road, and surrounded by an expanse of living green.</p>
               <p>"Whose beautiful dwelling-place is that?" said Catherine.</p>
               <p>"Let us pause a moment on the brow of this hill, that we may observe more
                  leisurely this enchanting view." Clifton ordered the carriage to stop, and
                  Catherine gazed with delighted eye around her. "The owner of that mansion, my
                  beloved Catherine," said Clifton, while he followed with his own her beaming
                  glances, "is a most blessed and happy man. Heaven has endowed him with wealth, and
                  also inspired him with a desire to make the gift subservient to his Creator's
                  glory. His heart overflows with love to his fellow-men, yet he felt alone in the
                  world, for, in common with other men, he was called to weep over the graves of his
                  kindred. He sighed for a bosom on which he could repose his cares and his trust.
                  He sought it not among the daughters of fashion, and yet he found it. He is now in
                  possession of a wife most lovely to his sight, but far more lovely to his soul;—a
                  meek, devoted, Christian wife, who, having loved him for himself alone,
                  unconscious of his wealth, now comes to share it, and help him to<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000145"/> distribute it among the children of sorrow and of
                  want." Catherine threw herself into her husband's arms and wept, but they were
                  tears of gratitude and joy; not for the affluence that was again to be her
                  portion, but that she was the wife of Clifton—deemed worthy to be his handmaid and
                  partner on earth, and destined, she humbly believed, to be his companion
                  hereafter, in that world "where there shall be no more marrying or giving in
                  marriage, but where all shall be like the angels of God in heaven."</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Mary Hawthorne.</head>
               <p>"MARY HAWTHORNE, why don't you come into the drawing-room? There is not a
                     <emph>very</emph> large company, so you need not be frightened away
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not; but I had rather pass the evening in your father's chamber. He will
                  be alone, and will welcome me, I know; and in the drawing-room, I should be a mere
                  cipher to others, while I would myself suffer the tortures which none but bashful
                  people can know."</p>
               <p>"Well, if you persist in your old-fashioned ways, I suppose I must let you follow
                  them; I acknowledge there is nothing particularly attractive as yet in the
                  assembly, so let us walk awhile on this green plat, and make our observations,
                  through these lighted windows, on the figures so gaily dressed."</p>
               <p>The speaker, a fashionable-looking, gaily-dressed young man, led his companion
                  along, as he spoke, to the spot indicated; and as they slowly promenaded in the
                  shade, he criticised with a practised eye the dress, air, and attitudes of the
                  group within, illuminated as it was by the shower of silver light that fell from
                  the brilliant chandeliers. There could not be a greater contrast in appearance,
                  than between the young man and his companion. Her apparel was remarkable in such a
                  scene, from its extreme simplicity; and there was no glow of beauty on her face,
                  or striking graces of person, to render the absence of all adventitious<pb
                     n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6687-00000146"/> ornament forgotten by the beholder. She
                  was not beautiful; she was not handsome; not even what the world calls pretty, and
                  yet she is the heroine of my story—and Henry Graham, the hero, was called the
                  handsomest man in his mother's drawing-room, when the elite of the city were
                  gathered there, as they were often wont to be.</p>
               <p>"Had you not better go in?" said Mary, as she observed the stately figure of Mrs.
                  Graham pass and repass the windows, pausing to say a few words to this guest,
                  bowing graciously to that, smiling benignantly on one, offering a fan to another,
                  the embodied spirit of politeness, ever moving, yet ever seeming exactly in the
                  right spot.</p>
               <p>"Not yet; stay awhile longer—there is no one there I care any thing about; and you
                  know I never trouble myself to entertain those who are indifferent to me. It is
                  incredible to me how my mother (Heaven forgive her!) can condescend to put on that
                  eternal smile, and to appear so delighted with people whom in her heart she
                  despises, laughs at, or dislikes. I must say, however, her smiles become her very
                  much; she is a noble-looking woman, and understands the art of dressing better
                  than any lady I know—I wish you would take lessons of her, Mary."</p>
               <p>"When I am as handsome as your mother, I will certainly do it. Let excessive
                  attention to dress be the peculiar privilege of beauty: <emph>I</emph> claim the
                  less appropriated one of unadorned homeliness."</p>
               <p>"You do injustice to yourself—you look very well, Mary, vastly better than a
                  hundred prettier girls. If you would summon a little more confidence, and assume
                  an air, a manner—that something, whose fascination we feel, yet cannot describe:
                  dress with a little more taste and fashion, you would find that nature has not
                  been such a niggard after all. You would be astonished yourself at the
                  metamorphosis."</p>
               <p>"It must have been far easier to transform Daphne into a laurel tree, and
                  Narcissus into a flower, than an awkward girl like me, into a modern fine lady.
                  Oh, Henry!" she continued, in a tone of deep feeling, "if you knew what I suffer
                  when I am in the midst of a scene like the one reflected before us, you would
                  never ask me to enter upon it. When I see so many fair forms, and so many admiring
                  eyes bent upon them, I cannot but make comparisons humbling to myself; and
                  sometimes I feel as if I would barter an empire, if I had it, for
                     <emph>such</emph> claims to honour: ay, 'tis true, I grow envious; and then I
                  hate myself."</p>
               <p>"Strange girl! With such a soul——" he was going on, probably, to exalt the
                  perfections of the soul in comparison with those of the body, when his attention
                  became suddenly and completely distracted; his eye rested on a lady, who, at that
                  moment, entered the drawing-room, and hastily saying, "I believe it is time I
                  should be there," Mary found herself alone beneath the mulberry tree, under which
                  they had just been standing. The most laboured eloquence could not have convinced
                  her more of the justice of her own reflections with regard to personal beauty,
                  than this simple act. The lady whom Henry so eagerly<pb n="310-311"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000147"/> sought, was beautiful—splendidly, surpassingly
                  beautiful: not from mere regularity of feature, and brilliancy of complexion, but
                  there was an air of regality about her, a queenly grace, such as Mary's
                  imagination had invested her lovely namesake of the house of Stuart with. She was
                  dressed magnificently; but the jewelry of her eyes transcended the gems that
                  glittered on her neck and arms; and even the diamond star, that shone midst the
                  darkness of her hair, flashed not more brightly than the glances she scattered
                  like sun-rays around her. Wherever she moved there was a buzz, a commotion, a
                  pressing forward of the gentlemen—a subsiding motion among the ladies. But who
                  could marvel? She moved with such grace! Mary caught herself repeating, before she
                  was aware of the recollection, <q>

                        <l>"The cygnet nobly walks the water—</l>

               <p>Wherever the fair stranger turned, Henry Graham followed her, with an animation of
                  countenance and earnestness of manner, strikingly contrasted with the languor and
                  indifference he generally manifested, when he felt no motive to call into exercise
                  those powers of pleasing with which he was eminently endowed. Mary sighed; she was
                  vexed with herself for sighing—she feared she was growing very envious.</p>
               <p>"I would rather die," said she to herself, "than give myself up to the dominion of
                  such a hateful passion. Conscious as I am of having that within which should lift
                  me above such grovelling thoughts —a heart glowing with the love of all that's
                  excellent and fair—a soul capable of bearing me to the very gates of the
                  empyrean——"</p>
               <p>She remembered, then, her office as nurse, in the chamber of the invalid master of
                  the gay mansion, and quitting her post of observation, she passed the illuminated
                  hall, and softly unclosed the door of an apartment, where she knew her light
                  footstep was always welcomed with joy.</p>
               <p>"Mary, my dear, is it you?" asked a mild voice, as she entered. She answered by
                  smoothing the pillow on which the invalid leaned in his easy chair, and placing
                  his footstool in a more comfortable position. What a change did this silent
                  chamber present from the hall into which she had just been gazing! The dim lamps
                  that burned upon the table, the close-drawn curtains shutting out the soft breath
                  of evening, the white locks and wan face that reclined upon the pillow—called up a
                  very different train of reflections from the dazzling lights, the crimson folds
                  drawn back by gilded shafts, the proud mien and flushed cheek of Mrs. Graham, or
                  the gaiety and splendour of her guests. She thought of her mother's sick room and
                  dying hour, her own deserted home, and, drawing a low chair near Mr. Graham, she
                  sat down in silence, for her heart was too full for speech.</p>
               <p>And who is Mary Hawthorne? What relation does she bear to the family of the
                  Grahams? And where did she acquire those rustic, retiring habits, so uncongenial
                  with her present situation? may be questions naturally asked and easily
                  answered.</p>
               <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6687-00000148"/>
               <p>Mary's mother was cousin to Mrs. Graham, and in early youth had been her
                  play-fellow, school-mate, and most familiar friend. An imprudent marriage, whose
                  result was a blighting of the heart, poverty, and seclusion from the world,
                  removed her entirely from Mrs. Graham's prosperous and brilliant sphere. Left in
                  widowhood with scarcely the means of support, yet too proud to ask assistance from
                  the early friends, whose neglect and alienation she bitterly felt, she continued
                  to struggle with her destiny, and to bear up herself and her young daughter above
                  the cold waters of despair that seemed fast closing around her, till, finding
                  herself sick and dying, she sent a messenger to the once affectionate friend of
                  her youth, and entreated her with all the eloquence of a dying mother's prayer, to
                  receive and cherish her desolate child.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Graham's good feelings were not so utterly worn out in the pursuit of the
                  world's pleasures, as to be unaffected by a petition like this. She promised all
                  that was asked; and Mrs. Hawthorne's last sigh was mingled with a throb of deep
                  thanksgiving. Mary, the humble, disciplined child of adversity and sorrow, became
                  a dependent on the bounty of one who, from her cradle, had been dandled in the lap
                  of smiling prosperity, and knew adversity and sorrow only by name. Accustomed to
                  the unbounded indulgence of her own passions, Mrs. Graham never reflected, that
                  others might have passions and feelings too. Consideration made no part of her
                  character. When she granted Mrs. Hawthorne's petition, she had flattered herself
                  that her orphan protege would give her additional eclat in society; she had
                  delineated her in her own imagination, with the classic outline of her mother's
                  beautiful face—a fair, drooping lily, gemmed with the dews of sorrow, that would
                  contrast sweetly with the roses of beauty she gathered into her drawing-room. Her
                  disappointment at seeing Mary was extreme, and she had not the delicacy or
                  kindness to conceal it. The weeds of mourning and the pallor of deep grief, had a
                  most unfavourable effect on Mary's naturally pale complexion and downcast eyes;
                  while awed by the unwonted splendour that surrounded her, she exhibited an
                  embarrassment of manner, which, to the self-possessed and graceful Mrs. Graham,
                  had the character of incurable awkwardness.</p>
               <p>"What a pity she's not prettier!" said she to a female friend, in a low voice, but
                  which Mary, accustomed to watch for the feeble accents of her mother, distinctly
                  heard; "I cannot conceive how it happens; her mother was one of the most beautiful
                  women I ever saw; I am shockingly disappointed; she seems excessively awkward,
                  too, poor thing!"</p>
               <p>Cold and heavy as lead did each unfeeling word sink in poor Mary's woe-worn heart.
                  Convicted of the atrocious crime of not being handsome, she had an intuitive
                  perception, that the qualities of the head and heart, which, amidst all the ills
                  of life, her mother had constantly taught her to cultivate, would be considered as
                  of little value in the estimation of Mrs. Graham. All the warm feelings of
                  gratitude and love, which she was ready to pour out at the feet of her
                     benefactress<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6687-00000149"/> tress, were congealed
                  at the fountain. She sickened in the midst of profusion, and would gladly have
                  laid herself in her mother's grave and died, if she could have escaped the chagrin
                  and isolation of her present lot. To have nobody to love her, nobody to love in
                  return, it was a living death, a frozen life; she could not endure it. At last she
                  found an object on whom she could lavish her sympathy, her affections, and her
                  cares. She had been for some time a member of the household before she knew there
                  was such a being in the world as Mr. Graham. There was such a constant bustle
                  about the house, such an ebbing and flowing of the tide of fashionable life, she
                  was perfectly bewildered; her faculties of seeing and hearing seemed to have
                  become dim and weakened; she felt a mere speck herself, a mote in the sunbeam,
                  whose oppressive glare withered up her young heart.</p>
               <p>One evening, she never forgot it, when sitting sad and unnoticed in a corner of
                  the room, Henry Graham, who, though the flattered votary of fashion, was gifted by
                  nature with warm and generous feelings, took compassion on the forlornness of her
                  situation, and asked her to walk in the garden and help him to gather some flowers
                  for his father. His father! it was the first time she had heard his name. She then
                  learned from him, that Mr. Graham had been long confined to his room, by a chronic
                  disease, which, though not attended with any immediate danger, was a source of
                  frequent suffering, and excluded him from all the active pleasures of
                  existence.</p>
               <p>"Oh, let me go to him," exclaimed Mary; "let me stay with him and nurse him; I am
                  too dull, too sad, to be where I am; will you not take me to him?"</p>
               <p>Henry was moved by the earnestness of her manner; it was the first time he had
                  heard distinctly the sound of her voice, or seen the colour of her eyes; for,
                  dismayed by the remarks of Mrs. Graham on her personal appearance, she had
                  remained perfectly silent from that moment in company, unless directly addressed,
                  with drooping lids, that too often covered tears, that would but dared not fall.
                  She now spoke with fervour, and her voice, though low, had an uncommon sweetness
                  of tone; and her mild, sad gray eye lighted up with an expression which not only
                  indicated exalted feeling, but intellectual power. Henry, though he had made his
                  best endeavours to bring down his mind to the level of coxcombry, and to form
                  himself after the most admired models of fashion, had not been quite able to do
                  it. The celestial spark would occasionally flash out. He had looked upon Mary as a
                  kind of automaton, a poor girl whom it was his mother's business to feed and
                  clothe, and, as such, entitled to kindness on his part. He now saw that she was a
                  feeling, thinking being, and Mary understood, with surprise and delight, she might
                  look for sympathy where she had least expected it. He walked with her through the
                  garden, pointing out to her observation what he thought most worthy of admiration,
                  conducted her kindly to his father's chamber, was very sorry he had not time to
                  remain himself, and left her, happier than she had been since she was an
                  orphan.</p>
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6687-00000150"/>
               <p>She was surprised when she saw an aged man, with snowy hair, reclining on a couch,
                  by the side of which Henry had seated her. Mrs. Graham, in full dress, might have
                  passed for the elder sister of her son, and could not have numbered half the years
                  of her husband. "This must be Henry's grandsire," thought she, "and yet he called
                  him father." She was mistaken—it was Mr. Graham, the neglected husband of his
                  younger, gayer wife, breathing out his unvalued existence, uncheered by those
                  soothing attentions, those offices of love, which can transform the couch of
                  sickness into a bed of roses. Yet many a poor cabin dweller doubtless envied him
                  his damask canopy, downy pillows, and numerous attendants, nor dreamed that the
                  inmate of such an apartment could sigh from the consciousness of neglect. He must
                  have been a very exacting man, for Mrs. Graham came into the room almost every
                  day, to inquire after his health, which was very kind, as he had been sick so
                  long, it would have been natural not to think of him at all; and Henry, who
                  certainly loved his father, often devoted an hour at a time to read to him or
                  converse with him. He would gladly have done more to prove his filial devotion,
                  but then, as he himself had told Mary, he had so little time. He was obliged to
                  attend his mother to so many parties, to see so much company at home, to go to the
                  theatre and the ball-room so often, he was so much admired and caressed, and he
                  was so unaffectedly and constitutionally indolent, it was surprising how he was
                  able to accomplish so much. From the hour Mary first stood by his side, and
                  offered, with a trembling hand, the flowers she had gathered in the evening, whose
                  commencement we have just described, during the lapse of a year, she had been to
                  him a ministering spirit of kindness and love. She became as light to his eyes and
                  fragrance to his senses. The face which was disregarded or criticised by the side
                  of the heartless belle, was welcomed by him as an angel visitor. She came to him
                  arrayed in the beauty of gentle words and deeds, and his chilled bosom melted with
                  tenderness, and warmed towards her with more than a father's love. Nor did she
                  confine herself to mere physical attentions. She administered to his mind the food
                  it loved, read to him hour after hour, till lulled by her voice, he slumbered
                  quietly as a soothed infant. Mary grew happy in the consciousness of being loved,
                  of being necessary to the happiness of another. She had another source of
                  happiness in the society of Henry, who found a relief from ennui in her natural
                  and unpretending conversation, exalted, as it oftentimes was, by beauty of
                  imagination and vigour of thought. When weary of playing the part of a fine
                  gentleman, weary of shining and being shone upon, or of lounging on a sofa, or
                  sauntering through the hall, he thought of Mary, and found himself refreshed and
                  invigorated in her presence. The best, the kindest of feelings of his nature were
                  called into exercise by this companionship, for Mary never touched a chord of the
                  human heart that did not answer in sweet music, provided that the heart were
                  rightly tuned.<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6687-00000151"/> He learned to look upon
                  her with the kindness and consideration of a brother, and sought to draw her more
                  into society, but here his efforts were generally unavailing.</p>
               <p>"Mary, my child, do not stay with me to-night," said Mr. Graham, laying his hand
                  on her head, as she drew a low seat close to him, and leaned on the elbow of his
                  chair—"you make yourself too much of a nun; I am a selfish old man, I know, but I
                  cannot bear to see you deprive yourself of every gratification at your age."</p>
               <p>"I find my chief pleasure here; I cannot even claim the merit of making a
                  sacrifice, for if I did not remain with you, I should most probably retire to my
                  own room."</p>
               <p>"I have a great deal to say to you, Mary, but I cannot do it to-night; I feel too
                  languid for the effort; another time when I can rally a little more strength,
                  remember what I have said: I must not defer it too long, for my life is gliding
                  away, grain after grain; a few more turnings of the glass and it will all be over.
                  Does it make you weep, child, to hear me speak thus? Well, take down that book and
                  read me to sleep, for my eyes are heavy, and it is better that I should not talk
                  now."</p>
               <p>Mary took the book, and began to read in those low, gentle tones, so soothing to a
                  sick man's ear. It was not long before his deepened breathing convinced her that
                  her voice was no longer heard. She paused awhile, and turning over the pages,
                  tried to continue reading to herself, but though it was an author she loved, she
                  could not fasten her attention upon a single paragraph. Her eyes ran over the
                  lines, and mechanically took in the words, but her thoughts wandered after the
                  dazzling stranger. Her curiosity was excited—she wondered at its own intensity.
                  She longed for the morning, that she might ask Henry her name and residence. She
                  laid down her book, and sat in the window, within the curtain, where she could see
                  and hear something of the movements in the hall; for Mr. Graham's room was in a
                  wing of the building, extending back from the main body of the house. The sash was
                  a little raised, and she could distinctly hear the notes of the piano, with the
                  accompaniment of a female voice of rare and exquisite melody. "That must be the
                  beautiful stranger," and she was right in her conclusion. It was Miss Devereux,
                  the star of the evening, the acknowledged beauty of a sister city, a nightingale
                  in song, a goddess in the dance, a perfect mirror of the graces. Female rivalry
                  was put aside in her presence, for she distanced all competition. It was no
                  disgrace to yield the palm to one so pre-eminent; it became a matter of policy to
                  praise and admire her, and for once, the ladies vied with the other sex, in their
                  flatteries and attentions. She had the peculiar power of conversing with half a
                  dozen gentlemen at the same time, and to make each believe that they were
                  particularly distinguished. She would keep a dozen more employed for her at the
                  same time, and each considered himself particularly honoured. No empress was more
                  despotic in her sway, yet she threw her chains around her vassals<pb n="320-321"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000152"/> so gracefully, that they gloried in their bondage.
                  If Mary was so anxious to hear her name, she had but to listen at the door of the
                  drawing-room, where it resounded from corner to corner the whole evening. It was
                  "Miss Devereux's glove," "Miss Devereux's fan," "Miss Devereux's this," and "Miss
                  Devereux's that," nothing in the world but Miss Devereux. It was strange how one
                  woman could turn so many people's heads in one night, but she was the <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">veni, vidi, vici</foreign> lady. It would be difficult to count
                  the tongues employed the next morning in discussing the merits of her person,
                  voice, dress, and manners. It is strange indeed, if no flaw were discovered in the
                  jewel, upon an inspection so close; perhaps the microscopic eye of envy might have
                  done so; but Henry Graham made no such discovery. Mary found him as ready to tell
                  her all he knew respecting her, as she was eager to ask. He described her as not
                  only the most beautiful being he ever beheld, but the most fascinating; he could
                  find no language sufficiently strong to do justice to her; he was obliged to speak
                  in ejaculatory sentences:—"How superbly she dances," "how divinely she sings,"
                  "such eyes," "such a brow," "such a glorious complexion!" It is unnecessary to
                  repeat all the encomiums that were uttered, or all that Mrs. Graham and her son
                  said respecting the evening's party or the morning's entertainment. The former was
                  delighted, because it had gone off so brilliantly, and the latter that he had been
                  roused and exalted into interest, and that the demon of ennui was charmed away,
                  for that day at least. And so it was for many days—for weeks. There was a constant
                  succession of parties, rides, excursions of pleasure, and every fashionable
                  pastime for the beautiful stranger. Henry became fascinated and bewitched; he
                  could talk of nothing else, till Mary, whose curiosity was completely satiated,
                  would gladly have changed the theme. She was unwilling to manifest her weariness,
                  lest Henry should mistake it for envy, and she sometimes feared it was so.
                  Gradually, however, he spoke of her less and less, but from his long fits of
                  abstraction, it was evident he thought the more; and Mary changing her fear,
                  dreaded lest he should suffer himself to be lured by a syren to works that might
                  wreck his peace. She knew but little of Miss Devereux, but she believed her
                  heartless; she could not understand how any one could appreciate the affections of
                     <emph>one</emph> who accepted with smiles, incense from all. Her fears were
                  soon confirmed by one of those accidents which reveal more of the character in one
                  moment, than is oftentimes done in years.</p>
               <p>There was a long walk in Mrs. Graham's garden, shaded on each side by a close
                  hedge, whither Mary was wont to retreat for solitude and exercise. One day, after
                  enduring the martyrdom of a dinner party, which Mrs. Graham had given in honour of
                  Miss Devereux, after feeling the presence of her beauty, till she seemed dazzled
                  by its brilliance, and wishing most fervently that for Henry's sake, so superb a
                  temple might have an indweller worthy of its fair proportions; she welcomed the
                  moment which gave the ladies liberty to retire, and sought her favourite<pb
                     n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6687-00000153"/> shade. She always chose the least
                  frequented side of the hedge, and was walking there, absorbed in thought, with her
                  usual stilly step, when she heard voices on the other side, one of which
                  immediately arrested her attention. It was that of Miss Devereux conversing with
                  another young lady, probably a bosom friend.</p>
               <p>"You are entirely mistaken," Miss Devereux was saying; "I care nothing about him,
                  only as he administers to the gratification of the present moment; I may prefer
                  him to any of the fools around me just now, because he is the handsomest, and
                  reported to be the richest."</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow," exclaimed her companion; "I always thought before you came, he was
                  cased in a suit of mail, impenetrable to ladies' attractions; but indeed, Julia,
                  you are wrong to encourage him so much if you really mean to discard him."</p>
               <p>"Discard him! let him give me the opportunity; and be assured he shall—he will. I
                  never suffer a man who has shown his devotion by exclusive attentions alone,
                  trying to earn a right to an acceptance, and to make himself sure of it before he
                  is committed, I never suffer such a man to escape: I lead him on till I bring him
                  to my feet, and then suffer him to get up as he can."</p>
               <p>"Supposing I undeceive him, and tell him what a deep coquette you are!"</p>
               <p>"Do it—I defy you to do it! and I would stake my life on his incredulity. The
                  chains are around him, the rivets are fastened, he cannot break them now: would
                  you know one of the great secrets of my power, Maria? They call me handsome: very
                  well—perhaps I am so—but it is this; in giving just enough encouragement to
                  inspire hope, and too little to create confidence."</p>
               <p>"Very well; but if you ever mean to marry I cannot conceive why you would not
                  accept him; he is handsome, rich, and fashionable."</p>
               <p>"It is true, if I were foolish enough to think of falling in love, it would be a
                  very good opportunity, but I love my independence and liberty too well; a few
                  years hence will do; I would not for the autocrat of the Russias barter the
                  freedom I now enjoy for domestic thraldom."</p>
               <p>Mary, compelled to be a listener from her situation, was indignant and amazed. She
                  could not have believed there was so much hollowness and art in the world. She
                  felt as if she had been reading a dark page of the human heart, and in her
                  simplicity and sincerity, looked upon Miss Devereux as little better than a
                  murderess. What! entice a person with smiles and graces, and kind glances, to lay
                  his whole affections at her feet, and then spurn them! Mary shuddered—she was but
                  a novice in the ways of the world—and she shuddered still more when she heard the
                  voice of Henry Graham accosting them, and the same silver tones which had just
                  been pronouncing his doom, address him with such seductive softness.</p>
               <p>"What, a rose! Mr. Graham offer me a rose! I thank you; but I dislike roses
                  exceedingly."</p>
               <p>"Dislike roses! impossible."</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6687-00000154"/>
               <p>"Very possible; they are so vulgar, so glaring and large; I cannot imagine how it
                  was ever named the queen of flowers."</p>
               <p>"Unqueen her then, and suffer me to place the diadem on the one yourself shall
                  call the fairest."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, no queen of flowers for me; they deserve not such honours; they are
                  too fading, too abundant; there is vulgarity in their very profusion; they are a
                  plebeian race, and I must acknowledge I dislike them all."</p>
               <p>Henry spoke of a ride proposed for the morrow, and hoped the sky would be as blue
                  and the air as pleasant, it was such a delightful excursion, the prospect was one
                  of the finest in the world."</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Graham, I sincerely think it one of the most foolish things in nature to
                  go so far for a little amusement. I shall go, and I thank you for starting the
                  idea, but how preposterous to ride so many miles over a dusty road and then climb
                  a steep rugged hill, leaving shreds of muslin and lace on every shrub, just to
                  admire a fine prospect and to have the blessed privilege of being weary!"</p>
               <p>"If you do not wish to go, Miss Devereux," continued Henry, "the party will be
                  broken up: we sought your pleasure particularly in the proposition; if I am not
                  very much mistaken, yourself suggested the idea."</p>
               <p>When the trio had again entered the house, Mary glided along her shaded path,
                  which she could not do before without crossing theirs, and making them conscious
                  of her previous vicinity, rejoicing for once that she was not beautiful, if beauty
                  must be accompanied with such heartless vanity and folly. Her mind was absorbed
                  with one thought, Miss Devereux and the painful disclosure she was compelled to
                  make to Henry Graham, for she deemed it a religious duty to inform him of the arts
                  of which he was destined to be the victim. She found an early opportunity of being
                  alone with him; she knew that they were to meet on the morrow, and she wished he
                  should arm himself in time with the panoply of moral courage, to defy the arts of
                  this insidious beauty.</p>
               <p>"Henry," said she, approaching the sofa on which he reclined. She felt a sudden
                  choking in her throat, and paused with the flush of embarrassment rising on her
                  pale cheek.</p>
               <p>"Well, what would you, Mary?" making room for her by his side. "What petition is
                  harbingered by that earnest look?"</p>
               <p>"None; I have no petition to make, merely simple facts to state, which I deem it
                  my duty, however unpleasant."</p>
               <p>"Do not hesitate; speak openly; am I not your brother? Address me as such."</p>
               <p>"I hesitate because I fear to give pain; I fear too to be associated in your mind
                  with painful emotions."</p>
               <p>"What is it you have to communicate? Your eyes are filled with tears, you breathe
                  with difficulty; is it any thing of Miss Devereux? Good heavens! Any accident? has
                  the carriage been overturned? is she hurt? is she killed?" and Henry started upon
                  his feet.</p>
               <pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6687-00000155"/>
               <p>"Pray, compose yourself: it is of Miss Devereux I would speak, yet I am not aware
                  of any accident. I have been an unwilling listener to-day to words you ought to
                  hear, as they may, they must affect the happiness of your future life." Gathering
                  courage from Henry's preposterous alarm, Mary faithfully repeated the cold,
                  treacherous dialogue she had overheard. Henry listened without any interruption;
                  she saw the blood mount higher and higher, till it reached his temples; he bit his
                  nether lip most ominously: was he angry with her or Miss Devereux? she could not
                  tell. At last he began to walk up and down the room with long tragic steps,
                  stopping occasionally and applying his hand to his forehead with a force that made
                  Mary start. She had never witnessed a lover's heroics, and was seriously alarmed.
                  Hardly knowing what she did, she ran to him, and seizing him by the arm, arrested
                  him in his rapid movements.</p>
               <p>"Henry, dear Henry! what is the matter? Do not suffer yourself to be moved in this
                  manner, try to forget her, she is not worthy you should give yourself such
                  suffering on her account."</p>
               <p>Henry shook her from him as if a viper had clung to him. Staggered by the violence
                  of the motion, she was obliged to lean against the wall for support, and stung to
                  the soul, she covered her face with her hands and burst into tears. He stopped,
                  looked steadily at her and became very pale.</p>
               <p>"Mary, beware what you are doing; it is dangerous to trifle with a man's passions
                  when they are roused as mine are. I cannot believe her such a hypocrite; deceit
                  never was enshrined in such a form; were an angel to tell me that she did not love
                  me, I would not believe it."</p>
               <p>"You think me then capable of falsehood?"</p>
               <p>"I think you have misunderstood and misinterpreted playful and innocent language.
                  You know nothing of the world: what woman of spirit will acknowledge her affection
                  for another, especially to a female friend? I would not wound your feelings, I may
                  have been too hasty, you always act from a sense of right, but, Mary, you know but
                  little of love."</p>
               <p>Mary's tears were checked, the sense of deep injustice and ingratitude supplied
                  her with dignity to bear her up above her wounded sensibility. Her mild eye lit up
                  with a burning ray, her cheek glowed with living crimson, she seemed transformed;
                  never before had her countenance beamed with such an expression; it imparted power
                  and beauty to her face. Henry caught it, and it had upon him the momentary effect
                  of fascination. Though the tide of exalted feeling soon rolled back, effacing for
                  the time every impression but one, in after hours of darkness and despondency, the
                  recollection of this flashing out of the heart and soul came to him as the torch,
                  lighting up the gloom of a mine: Mary moved to the door and laid her hand upon the
                  latch.</p>
               <p>"My errand is done," said she; "how painful a one it has been, is useless for me
                  to say. Had I known the manner in which it would be received, I might have
                  lingered longer; but it is better as it is; I have done what truth and friendship
                  required, and it is<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6687-00000156"/> enough. Grateful
                  friendship, I ought to say, for when dejected, oppressed, and unappreciated by
                  others, every fountain of joy sealed up, you came with sympathy and kindness on
                  your lips and in your heart, and the living waters once more gladdened the desert
                  of my life. From that hour gratitude to yourself and father have been a strong
                  vital principle within me. Simple, inexperienced girl as I am, I know you better
                  than the world does, and I have the boldness now to utter it: while the flatterers
                  of your fortune deem you the mere indolent devotee of fashion, I have seen a depth
                  of feeling and vigour of intellect that shamed the worldly bondage to which it
                  submitted. That feeling and intellect will yet work out deliverance and triumph;
                  you will hereafter do me justice."</p>
               <p>Henry looked after her as she closed the door, as Amarath did upon the genius
                  Syndaria when he had encircled her finger with the magic ring. He felt the power
                  and purity of truth, and his conscience upbraided him for the ungracious manner in
                  which he had met the admonition of his friend. Then again his imagination
                  delineated the goddess form of Miss Devereux, the darkness of "her oriental eye"
                  swam before his gaze: he thought of her houri smile, and convinced himself that
                  she was all that was excellent as well as all that was fair; Mary's fastidious
                  ideas of rectitude had been needlessly alarmed, and had converted a little
                  badinage and evasion into moral turpitude. He attended the riding party the
                  following day; Mrs. Graham was also there in high spirits; Mary remained, as
                  usual, by the couch of Mr. Graham.</p>
               <p>The house was almost deserted; the servants, as a reward for the many extra
                  services required of them during such a succession of parties, were enjoying a
                  holiday. Every room in the usually gay mansion was as still as the sick chamber
                  where Mary kept her unwearied vigils.</p>
               <p>"Mary, my dear," said the invalid—in a moment she was bending over him, "place
                  these pillows behind me, and draw back that curtain, so that I may feel the west
                  wind through the slats; I feel better than I have for many days, I can breathe
                  more freely. Do you remember a promised communication you were to hear when I
                  could summon sufficient strength and resolution? I dare not defer it longer;
                  something warns me to finish all I have to do on earth, for I shall soon rest on a
                  pillow where your kind hands, my Mary, can never reach me more. Give me a glass of
                  that cordial and draw your chair still closer, and now let me begin before this
                  glow has left my frame."</p>
               <p>Mary had not forgotten what he had once said to her on this subject. Her curiosity
                  had been excited and interested, but now the moment had arrived when it was to be
                  gratified, she shrunk with awe and misgiving from the mysterious communication.
                  She gazed with solemn interest on the aged speaker, whose sunken eyes were turned
                  on her with a look of intense and prophetic meaning.</p>
               <p>"Mary, if I had strength to relate to you the history of my life, you would wonder
                  what strong passions had warred in this now wasted frame. I cannot<pb n="330-331"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000157"/> go back to my youth, I will not even revert to my
                  prime of manhood; it was passed before I became a married man. When I tell you
                  that never heart of mortal was more bound up in visions of home and domestic joy,
                  that I centred in it all my affection, care, wealth, and happiness; when you see
                  how my affection has been repaid, my cares returned, my wealth dissipated, my
                  happiness disregarded—oh! my child, I am a dying old man, and ought to wrestle no
                  longer with the dark spirits of this world, but when I think of the folly, the
                  recklessness, the hard-heartedness of those from whom I had a right to expect
                  pity, kindness, and love, the blood of nearly seventy years burns in my chilled
                  veins."</p>
               <p>"Oh! forbear, sir, you are flushed, you are feverish, you cannot bear this
                  exertion."</p>
               <p>"Interrupt me not when I have so much to say, such uncertain breath to utter it. I
                  said I had centred all my wealth in my home; I was wrong; when my son was about
                  sixteen,—unfortunate boy, left exposed to such pernicious influences,—I was called
                  to Europe upon commercial business of great importance: during my residence there,
                  some fortunate speculation, which it is unnecessary to detail, became to me a
                  source of immense wealth. When I returned, and learned the extravagant career my
                  wife had run, her boundless ambition to be first in every idle expenditure, I
                  resolved to make a secret of my newly acquired riches, and vowed to hoard it, that
                  my son, whom she was training as her disciple, might have an inheritance secure
                  from her dissipation. I might have secured it to him by law, but I had another
                  object in view: I had a lesson to teach them both, a lesson they are yet bitterly
                  to learn. I love my son, nature has gifted him with noble qualities, and had not
                  heaven prostrated me upon this sick bed at the time I was most anxious to direct
                  his education, he might have been a man; but left to the uncontrolled influence of
                  such a mother, is it strange that he has lost the nobility of nature? Interrupt me
                  not, my own dear Mary; my story yet remains to be told. Upon my return this
                  mansion was vacated; though only a few miles from the city, it was too retired in
                  winter for Mrs. Graham's gay propensities. I brought with me, from Europe, a young
                  man, in the capacity of a servant, though his object was to come over to this
                  country and find employment as a carpenter, being a poor but very ingenious
                  mechanic. He came with me to this place, then deserted of its inmates; I brought
                  him into this very room, I locked him within it till he had completed the work I
                  had appointed him to do. He finished his task; bound by an oath of secrecy, he
                  received the stipulated sum, left me and died soon after of a sudden disease. No
                  being but myself knows the work he wrought."</p>
               <p>He paused from exhaustion, nor could he forbear to smile at the wild expression of
                  Mary's countenance as she glanced round the room, almost expecting to see
                  supernatural beings issue from the walls.</p>
               <p>"There is nothing here to harm you, Mary," continued he, after a pause; "I
                  employed no unholy means; my journeyman laboured after a European<pb n="332-333"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000158"/> model. Now rise, my child, bolt both doors, that no
                  one may enter unawares; you cannot draw the bolts with such a trembling hand;
                  there, that is a little steadier. Now walk to the fire-place and press firmly with
                  a downward motion against the lower pannel, the right side of the chimney; a
                  little lower, firmer, harder; harder yet."</p>
               <p>Mary obeyed the directions, bewildered and frightened at finding herself such a
                  mysterious agent. The pannel suddenly slid, and a small secret closet was
                  revealed.</p>
               <p>"Mary, hand me the casket within that closet."</p>
               <p>The heavy casket was placed on his bed; he drew from his bosom a small key, which
                  was suspended from his neck by a chain, and bidding Mary unfasten the hasp, he
                  immediately clasped it around her own. "And now, Mary," said he, with a more
                  solemn, deeper accent, "you are in possession of the key that unlocks that foreign
                  treasure I have so long secured from the unprincipled waste of wealth; hide it in
                  your bosom, let not even the chain be visible, guard it as the bequest of a dying
                  man, who is about to bequeath you a more sacred legacy still."</p>
               <p>Mary sank on her knees by the bed-side and clasped his hands imploringly in hers.
                  "Do not, do not, I entreat you, sir, bequeath this gold to me. It would weigh me
                  down to the dust; this chain even now seems a string of fire around my neck. Your
                  son, your son, the wealth is his, who is so fitting to receive it from your hands;
                  he is worthy of your trust, he will not abuse it."</p>
               <p>The sick man raised his feeble body with an energy that appalled her. "It is for
                  the sake of that son, that now degenerate boy, I leave this in your immediate
                  keeping. Within this casket is a letter to Henry, explaining to him all my wishes:
                  put it back in the recess, replace the pannel and unbolt the doors. Approach me
                  once more, and with your hand in mine, your eyes lifted to heaven, promise to obey
                  me in my last directions, and my soul shall bless you in its parting hour."</p>
               <p>Subdued and awe-stricken, Mary lifted her tearful eyes and faltered out the
                  promise he exacted.</p>
               <p>"It is enough; the lips of truth have vowed, and the vow will never be broken.
                  When I am gone my estate will be involved in irremediable ruin; I have long
                  foreseen this would be the result of such boundless extravagance. I have long
                  since ceased to warn, for my unhappy son needs the lesson in store; adversity
                  alone will rouse him from his mental and moral lethargy; let him but once be
                  forced to call his powers into exercise by commanding necessity, and they will
                  come like a legion of angels to his help in the hour of need; let him become poor,
                  flatterers will desert him, beauty will slight him, he will turn from the hollow
                  world and be regenerated. He must go through this stormy ordeal, and then, when
                  all the dross is removed, when he stands unalloyed and firm on the independent
                  basis of his own character, and not till then, may this casket, from whose
                  contents you have in the mean time derived your own support, be committed into his
                  keeping."</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6687-00000159"/>
               <p>"But should the lesson fail, should he sink into despondency and inaction, once
                  more I entreat——"</p>
               <p>"You have promised, entreaties are vain; if the lesson should fail, he merits it
                  not, and I leave it in worthier hands. You have been to me like the renovated
                  spirit of my own youth; to you I look for every thing that remains of my comfort
                  and support. I feel a faith, strong as that inspired by prophecy, that my son will
                  shake the dust from his spirit and put on the beautiful garments of true manhood:
                  you will not always remain the guardian of this treasure. As for her, who has
                  alienated herself from me from the hour she became a bride, who has neglected me
                  for long years on my sick bed, left me to the care of hirelings till God in his
                  mercy sent me a loving and tender daughter in you, the time is to come, and soon,
                  when she will cling to the reeds of fortune and find them break in her grasp;
                  when, deserted by seeming friends, she will feel the horrors of solitude and
                  remember me; let repentance be her dowry."</p>
               <p>The voice of the sick man assumed a tone alarmingly hollow as he uttered the last
                  words. His head sank back heavily on Mary's shoulder, who gazing in his face, saw
                  that his eyes were fixed with a glassy stare. Though she felt a dreadful
                  conviction that the effort he had just made had exhausted the strength of life,
                  and that he was sinking at once, now the moment of excitement was passed, she did
                  not lose her presence of mind. She laid him back on the pillow, and bathed his
                  temples and face with the restorative waters, with which the chamber was supplied;
                  she chafed his cold hands, but the features remained rigid, the eyes moved not in
                  answer to her fearful glance. She recollected that one waiting maid had been
                  ordered to remain behind, and, ringing the bell till the girl ran in, she
                  immediately despatched her for the physician. When he arrived and took the
                  patient's hand, it fell like lead on the bed-side. His skill availed him nothing
                  here—he was dead.</p>
               <p>Mary now felt an awful responsibility resting upon her, rendered doubly solemn by
                  the instantaneous death of him who had entrusted it—the delegated guardian of
                  Henry's wealth and fame—the repository of a secret so strange as almost to baffle
                  credulity. Mary felt all this, till she sank down in the hopelessness of despair:
                  but even in this first hour of despair, she prayed that she might be strengthened
                  by Him, who himself prayed, when bowed by more than mortal agonies; and the hope,
                  the conviction that the son would be regenerated over the ashes of the father,
                  came like the wing of an angel hovering over the gloom.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Graham was shocked, excessively shocked, by the suddenness of the event. She
                  shrieked and even fainted, when, on her return from the party, she found herself
                  standing by the shrouded body of her husband, by the side of which Mary sat in the
                  immobility of sorrow: she was reminded of her own mortality; the chill atmosphere
                  of death oppressed and appalled her. The conviction that the gay, glittering life
                  she was leading was nothing but a passage to the grave, the cold, deep, lonely
                  grave, came over her heavily and suddenly.</p>
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6687-00000160"/>
               <p>Henry's grief was sincere. The poignancy of self-reproach added intolerable stings
                  to filial affliction. While he had been engaged in selfish amusement,
                  administering to the pleasures of an adulated beauty, given up to high and
                  unhealthy excitement, the irreproachable Mary had clung to the anchor of
                  duty—sustained his father's dying agonies and received his parting breath.</p>
               <p>It was after every thing had subsided into the stillness of gloom, which succeeds
                  such startling events, that Mary, whose energies of mind were now called into
                  vigorous exercise by the responsibilities which had so mysteriously devolved upon
                  her, endeavoured to extend that influence over the mind of Henry, which true moral
                  excellence and modest, intellectual strength always give its possessor. Conscious
                  of the reverse of fortune that awaited him, she tried to arouse his ambition by
                  the purest and most exalted motives. She related the conversations she had often
                  had with his father, when left alone with him in his sickness, in which he
                  deplored the indolence of character, which permitted the most brilliant attributes
                  of mind to remain mouldering in inaction. She told of the dreams in which he
                  sometimes indulged, of loving to see the son of his hopes sitting in the high
                  places of the land, swaying the multitude by his eloquence, watching over insulted
                  laws, and avenging outraged humanity.</p>
               <p>With a heart softened by sorrow, a conscience enlightened by the same salutary
                  counsel, Henry listened as to his better angel, and made the most ardent
                  resolutions for the future.</p>
               <p>Without entering into tedious and unprofitable details, it may be said here that
                  Mr. Graham's executor found that he had died insolvent; that the consternation of
                  the widow was unutterable, and the wonder and sympathy of her innumerable friends,
                  as sincere and valuable as they usually are on such occasions. <emph>Mulberry
                     Grove,</emph> the beautiful and stately mansion, was to be sold. Mrs. Graham
                  was to take private lodgings in the city; her son was going on a European tour,
                  and Mary was to return to the obscurity of her native village. Such were the
                  ondits of the world of fashion.</p>
               <p>Among those who came to pay visits of condolence, after the knowledge of their
                  worst misfortune, were Miss Devereux and her inseparable friend. She was on the
                  eve of her departure to her native city, and mingled her expressions of sympathy
                  for her friends, with the warmest words of gratitude for their attentions. She
                  wanted to walk once more in that beautiful garden, which she should always
                  remember as a model of the blended loveliness of nature and art. In the course of
                  their walk, she managed so skilfully as to separate herself from her companion,
                  and to be alone with Henry by the hedge. This accomplished coquette had no thought
                  of departing with the glory of her conquest unacknowledged. Though his fallen
                  fortunes rendered it of less consequence, his name was to be added to the number
                  of her victims; for her ambition<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6687-00000161"/>
                  stopped not at less than a hecatomb. The opportunity was irresistible; the
                  temptation equally so. The sympathy she had assumed diffused a captivating
                  softness over the lustre of her beauty, and there was an abandonment, an
                  abstraction in her manner, that might have given encouragement to a bolder lover.
                  The declaration was made: it was a pouring out of the whole heart and soul, with
                  all the generous fervour of a first acknowledged attachment: as Miss Devereux
                  afterwards told her confident, "it was the most graceful, impassioned, and heroic
                  declaration she had ever received, and had she not been informed about his loss of
                  wealth, she was afraid she might have been foolish enough to have consented." She
                  heard him in silence, with downcast eyes, from which rays of gratified vanity were
                  brightly stealing. She then drew back with the air of a queen, who is about to
                  reject the petition of a vassal; was greatly surprised and distressed; she had
                  never imagined the existence of such feelings on his part; uttered some cold words
                  about friendship and esteem, courtesied gracefully, and moved towards the house,
                  leaving Henry to reflections we have no wish to describe. The greatest kindness we
                  can offer to a man of real and deep sensibility, who first discovers he has been
                  the dupe of heartless vanity, is to "leave him to himself."</p>
               <p>It was that very night, when the family had retired to rest, and the whole
                  household in the quiet attendant on that lonely hour, Mary left the room, bearing
                  in her hand a feeble lamp, and directed her steps to the chamber lately occupied
                  by Mr. Graham. She had formed the resolution of going back to the scenes of her
                  childhood, in the midst of her mother's friends, and supporting herself by the
                  exercise of her talents. She could teach a school; she was confident she could
                  gain a subsistence. Nothing would induce her to remain an incumbent on Mrs.
                  Graham. As the estate was to be sold, Mary deemed it her first duty to take
                  possession of the treasure, of which she was made the reluctant guardian.
                  Notwithstanding the sacredness of the charge, and the uprightness of her own
                  principles, she trembled, and drew her breath quickly and short, as she opened the
                  door of an apartment so lately solemnized by the awful presence of death,
                  surrounded by the dim shadow of midnight, secret and alone. Notwithstanding her
                  cautious movements, the wind, which blew with a strong current through the long
                  hall, pressed against the door with such force that it eluded her grasp, and
                  closed with a noise which almost terrified her from her purpose. Sick at heart,
                  she sat down in the easy chair, which, but a little while before, she had seen
                  occupied by the venerable form now covered with the mould of the grave. She lived
                  over the last, impressive scene, heard again the solemn adjurations of paternal
                  anguish, and her resolution became strengthened for the task. She rose—put down
                  her lamp—pressed the secret door—drew forth the casket—replaced the panel, and
                  lifting up the lamp, was turning towards the door, when the opposite one slowly
                  opened, and Mrs. Graham stood before her. Mary uttered a faint<pb n="340-341"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000162"/> shriek, the lamp dropped from her hand, and she
                  remained gazing on the apparition without the power of speech or motion.</p>
               <p>"What is your business here?" at length exclaimed Mrs. Graham, her eye fixed as if
                  by fascination on the casket—rushing towards her with exasperation in every
                  feature.</p>
               <p>"I came on an errand of duty," faltered Mary, with bloodless lips.</p>
               <p>"And that casket, how came it in your possession? Am I to be plundered in my own
                  household, by one whom my bounty has fed? Give it me this instant for your
                  life."</p>
               <p>Mary grasped it to her bosom with convulsive agony, yet with a resolution as firm
                  as that with which the martyr clings to the cross, for which he is yielding up his
                  life.</p>
               <p>"Do you dare defy me thus?" exclaimed Mrs. Graham, seizing her arm, and shaking
                  her with delirious force. "I'll rouse every servant in the
                  household—minion—thief!"</p>
               <p>"By the soul of the sainted dead, I am innocent!" cried Mary, emboldened by the
                  consciousness of her own innocence, and the sacred guardianship to which she had
                  been elected. "Touch not this, Mrs. Graham, as you would rest in your own dying
                  hour. It was intrusted to me by your husband, with his last breath. I vowed to
                  guard it till the hour appointed. Let not the curse of perjury rest upon me. Incur
                  not the wrath of Heaven by disregarding the wishes, the commands of the dead."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Graham was not in a situation to listen to any appeal. She had been kept
                  awake by an acute nervous affection, which she had in vain endeavoured to soothe.
                  Her indignation was boundless, her purpose immoveable. Her hands seized the
                  casket, which Mary vainly struggled to retain. Mrs. Graham was a tall, stately,
                  strong woman; Mary a slender girl, with feeble muscles, that relaxed at last in
                  the powerful grasp that held her.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Henry, Henry!" shrieked the unfortunate girl, "where art thou?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Graham burst into a convulsive laugh, and held the casket in her right hand,
                  extended over the victim now prostrate at her feet.</p>
               <p>At that moment, as if Providence had marked out that night for its own particular
                  purpose, the door was thrown back by a sudden motion, and Henry Graham stood
                  before them. It would be strange indeed if a rejected man thought of slumber; it
                  is certain he had not, but, racked by feelings that maddened him, he had walked
                  his own room like a restless ghost, till Mary's shrill cry of agony, issuing from
                  the chamber of death, pierced his ear, and brought him to the scene on which he
                  now gazed in unutterable amazement. The majestic figure of his mother, in her
                  white night-dress, and long black locks that, loosened in the struggle, streamed
                  back from her brow, with uplifted arm, holding a glittering casket, standing over
                  the pale and prostrate Mary, in that chamber where the shadows of death still
                  lingered, suddenly confronted him.</p>
               <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6687-00000163"/>
               <p>"Gracious Heavens! what does this mean?" asked Henry.</p>
               <p>"What does it mean?" repeated Mrs. Graham, dragging Mary forward with one hand,
                  while she shook the casket in the other; "it means that this girl is a wretch, a
                  plunderer, who steals in the silence of midnight to rifle your father's coffers,
                  and rob you of your inheritance."</p>
               <p>"Impossible, impossible!" exclaimed Henry. "Rise, Mary, rise and vindicate
                  yourself from a charge so black."</p>
               <p>The generous and devoted girl, even in the moment of despair, thought not of
                  herself, but him. She hailed his sudden appearance as a direct interposition of
                  Heaven, in vindication of his rights. Freeing herself from Mrs. Graham's now
                  relaxing grasp, she clung to Henry with frantic energy.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Henry, think not of me, but of yourself. That casket is yours; your father
                  gave it in my keeping in his last hour. He resisted my prayers and tears that I
                  might be spared such a trust. He made me swear by the Heaven that now hears me, to
                  be true to the charge, to keep it, to cherish it, till adversity, unknown before,
                  had called out the heaven-born energies within you. It was for your sake he has
                  secreted this wealth for years. It was for your sake he committed it first to
                  these feeble hands. He has left with it a letter, expressing to you all his wishes
                  and his hopes. On the eve of returning to the obscurity of my own lot, obedient to
                  the commands of the dead, I sought this chamber and took possession of that fatal
                  treasure. Oh! that he had left it in other hands than mine!"</p>
               <p>Henry, at that moment, would as soon have doubted the evidence of truth itself, as
                  the words of Mary. Free from the spell which had lately enthralled his faculties
                  and dimmed his perception of right and wrong, he saw Mary's character in its own
                  pure, exalted light. Throwing one arm around her, as if to shield her from the
                  storm that had just swept her down, he turned to his mother, with the respect of a
                  son, but the authority of a man, in his voice and manner:</p>
               <p>"My mother, woe be unto those who break the commands that death has hallowed. By
                  all that is sacred, I entreat you to restore what I must say, you have most
                  unjustly assumed."</p>
               <p>The conscience of Mrs. Graham had convinced her, as she listened to Mary's
                  explanation, that she had shamefully wronged her, but her pride refused to yield
                  to its convictions.</p>
               <p>"No!" said Mary, "I never can resume its guardianship. Destiny has interposed to
                  save me from this oppressive responsibility. Into your hands I now commit what
                  Heaven has willed I should not retain. Here is the key, which your father
                  suspended round my neck with his own hands. It was the last office they ever
                  performed: almost the last words he ever uttered, was a prophecy of the future
                  glory of your manhood. Oh! Henry, fulfil that dying prophecy, and it matters not
                  who keeps the gold, which is but dust in the balance of such a reputation."</p>
               <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6687-00000164"/>
               <p>Henry took the casket from his mother's unresisting hand, knelt down and opened it
                  in silence. He stopped not to count the gold, or to ascertain its immense value,
                  but drawing out the paper directed to himself, closed it again, and gave it back
                  to his mother.</p>
               <p>"I have taken all I shall ever claim. Mother, this is yours, take it, and use it
                  as you will. Mary is right in declining to receive it, and as for myself, I will
                  read the stern lesson my father willed that I should learn. Nay, I will not keep
                  it; I will earn my fortune, or be a poor man to the last day of my life."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Graham refused and reasoned, but at last convinced herself that a mother was
                  the most fitting person to be the guardian of her son's property. She would not
                  consent to it but from that conviction. She condescended to ask Mary to forget the
                  occurrence of the night, and to look upon her as she had ever done, considering
                  her house, wherever it might be, as her home. But Mary, while she expressed
                  gratitude for the offer and for past kindness, declared it her earnest wish to
                  return to the village where she was born, mid scenes more congenial to her taste.
                  Henry did not oppose this resolution. He respected the motive too highly, and her
                  honour, her happiness would be promoted by the change.</p>
               <p>It was a source of speculation, of surprise, when it was made known to the world,
                  soon after this eventful night, that <emph>Mulberry Grove</emph> was not to pass
                  from the possession of its owners. Mrs. Graham did not retrench her expenses, and
                  of course the number of her friends and flatterers remained undiminished. The
                  removal of so humble and unpretending a being as Mary, was a matter of too little
                  importance to excite observation, but when it was ascertained beyond a doubt, that
                  the indolent and fashionable Henry Graham was become an indefatigable student of
                  that profession which he had before only nominally embraced; when he was at length
                  seen at the bar, in eloquence and power, pleading for injured innocence or
                  violated right, then the world did indeed marvel at the transformation, and talk
                  of it as a modern miracle.</p>
               <p>We will pass over the events of the following year. They may be understood from
                  one scene which took place in the little village of ——, at the close of a summer
                  day. A group of gay, neatly dressed little girls were running merrily from the
                  door of a low isolated building that stood in the middle of a green common. The
                  sun-bonnets thrown recklessly back, the satchels swinging from their arms, the
                  unbounded gaiety of their motions, all spoke "the playful children just let loose
                  from school." A gentleman, who seemed to be a traveller, from the thick
                  riding-dress he wore, on so mild a day, accosted one of the eldest children in
                  that tone of habitual gentleness and courtesy, that even untaught children know
                  how to appreciate. He asked if they were returning from school. An affirmative
                  accompanied by a low courtesy, was the reply. "The name of the school-mistress?"
                  "Mary Hawthorne—yonder she comes;" and the affectionate child ran to her beloved
                  instructress, to announce the approach of the stranger. But Mary's<pb n="346-347"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000165"/> eye needed not the annunciation. She had recognized
                  the well-known form of Henry Graham, and the next moment her hand was in his.</p>
               <p>"Mary Hawthorne!" For eighteen months she had not heard his voice. Past scenes
                  rushed to her recollection, and joy and exultation swelled her heart. She knew
                  that his father's prophecy was fulfilled. During the months of their separation,
                  he had constantly written to her, and every letter breathed the progressive
                  elvation of his soul. She had followed in spirit, with trembling anxiety, his
                  onward course, till it had reached the goal of fame, and now he stood before her,
                  as his dying father so eloquently expressed, "in the beautiful robes of true
                  manhood." And Mary, too, was changed. The consciousness of exciting so noble an
                  influence as she had, over a naturally noble mind, the exertion of her own
                  independent faculties, and the pure air she breathed in those beautiful regions,
                  had imparted a glow to her countenance, and a vigour to her frame, they had never
                  before possessed. Her face was now radiant with the most lovely expression the
                  female lineaments can wear.</p>
               <p>"You have grown handsome, Mary, as well as blooming," said Henry, as they walked
                  together towards Mary's rural home; and Mary, who seldom blushed, coloured like a
                  true heroine, at the unwonted compliment.</p>
               <p>That evening, after having related all the struggles he had sustained with
                  constitutional and habitual indolence, the counteracting influence of his mother,
                  who considered the course he was pursuing as degrading grading rather than
                  exalting; after an hour of the most unbounded confidence, Henry drew from his
                  bosom the letter of his father, which he had taken from the memorable casket.</p>
               <p>"Mary, the time has arrived when I may ask you to read this letter. My whole soul
                  and heart are in my father's wishes. On your decision—"he was too much agitated to
                  go on. He placed the letter in her hands, and gazed in silence on her downcast
                  face while she perused its contents. He saw, through gathering tears and rushing
                  crimson, gratitude, joy, and shame. He remembered the moment when, after having
                  warned him of the arts of Miss Devereux, he had accused her of "knowing little of
                  love," and her countenance had so eloquently vindicated the charge. He felt that
                  through all his errors he had been beloved, and he wondered at himself that he
                  could ever have been insensible to such real and exalted loveliness.</p>
               <p>Is it needful to say what were Mr. Graham's solemn wishes, what the decision on
                  which the happiness of Henry's existence depended? That he should take this
                  inestimable girl as his wife, as a legacy more precious than the gold of the East;
                  and she did become his wife, and he never regretted the hour when he was discarded
                  by the beautiful Miss Devereux.</p>

               <head>The Drunkard's Daughter.</head>
               <p>KATE FRANKLIN sat at the window, watching the lightning that streamed through the
                  sky, till her eyes were almost blinded by the glare. She was naturally timid, and
                  had an unusual dread of a thunder-storm, yet though the lightning ran down in
                  rills of fire, and the thunder rolled till the earth shook with its
                  reverberations, she kept her post of danger, repeating, as she gazed abroad, "Oh!
                  that I were a boy, that I might venture abroad in search of my father! It is
                  almost midnight, yet he is not returned. He will perish in a storm like this. Oh!
                  that I were a boy!" she again passionately exclaimed—while the rain began to drive
                  against the casement, and the wind swept the branches of the trees roughly by the
                  panes. She held a young baby in her arms, which she had just lulled to sleep, and
                  her mother lay sleeping in a bed in the same apartment. All slumbered but Kate,
                  who for hours had watched from the window for her father's return. At length her
                  resolution was taken: she laid the babe by her mother's side, drew down the
                  curtain to exclude the lightning's glare, and throwing a shawl around her, softly
                  opened the door, and soon found herself in the street, in the midst of the
                  thunder, the lightning, and the rain. How strong must have been the impulse, how
                  intense the anxiety, which could have induced a timid young girl to come out at
                  that lone, silent hour, on such a night, without a protector tector or a guide!
                  She flew along at first, but the rain and the wind beat in her face, and the
                  lightning bewildered her with its lurid corruscations. Then pausing for breath,
                  she shaded her eyes, and looking fearfully around, gazed on every object, till her
                  imagination clothed it with its own wild imagery.</p>
               <p>At length her eye fell on a dark body extended beneath a tree by the way-side. She
                  approached it, trembling, and kneeling down, bent over it, till she felt a hot
                  breath pass burningly over her cheek, and just then a sheet of flame rolling round
                  it, she recognized but too plainly her father's features. She took his hand, but
                  it fell impassive from her hold. She called upon his name, she put her arms around
                  his neck and tried to raise him from the earth, but his head fell back like lead,
                  and a hoarse breathing sound alone indicated his existence.</p>
               <p>"Father, dear father, wake and come home!" she cried, in a louder tone; but the
                  thunder's roar did not rouse him, how much less her soft, though earnest voice.
                  Again she called, but she heard only the echoes of night repeating her own
                  mournful adjuration—"Father, dear father, come home!"</p>
               <p>How long she thus remained, she knew not; but the wind and the rain subsided, the
                  lightning flashed with a paler radiance, and at intervals the wan moon might be
                  seen wading through the gray, watery clouds. She felt her strength exhausted, and
                  clasping her hands together, lifted her eyes, streaming with tears, almost wishing
                  a bolt would fall and strike them both simultaneously.</p>
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6687-00000167"/>
               <p>"My father is lost!" said she, "and why should I wish him to live? Why should I
                  wish to survive him?"</p>
               <p>The sound of horse's feet approaching startled her. The horseman checked his speed
                  as he came opposite the tree, where Kate still knelt over her father, and as the
                  lightning played over her white garments, which, being wet by the rain, clung
                  closely around her, she might well be mistaken for an apparition. Her shawl had
                  fallen on the ground, her hair streamed in dripping masses over her face, and her
                  uplifted arms were defined on the dark background of an angry sky. The horse
                  reared and plunged, and the rider dismounting, came as near to the spot as the
                  impetuous animal would allow.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Harry Blake, is it you?" exclaimed Kate. "Then my father will not be left
                  here to die!"</p>
               <p>"Die!" repeated Harry; "what can have happened? Why are you both abroad such a
                  night as this?"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" said Kate, "I could not leave my father to perish. I sought him through
                  the storm, and I find him thus."</p>
               <p>While she was speaking, Harry had fastened the bridle of his horse to the tree,
                  and stooped down on the other side of Mr. Franklin. Kate's first feeling on his
                  approach was a transport of gratitude—now she was overwhelmed with shame; for she
                  knew, as Harry inhaled the burning exhalation of his breath, his disgraceful
                  secret would be revealed—that secret which her mother and herself had so long in
                  anguish concealed.</p>
               <p>"Poor Kate!" involuntarily burst from his lips, as he gazed on the prostrate and
                  immoveable form of the man he had so much loved and respected. Had he seen him
                  blasted by the lightning's stroke, he could not have felt more shocked or grieved.
                  He comprehended in a moment the full extent of his degradation, and it seemed as
                  if an awful chasm, yawning beneath his feet, now separated him, and would for ever
                  separate him from his instructor and friend.</p>
               <p>"Kate," said he, and his voice quivered from emotion, "this is no place for you.
                  You are chilled by the rain—you will be chilled to death, if you remain in your
                  wet garments. Let me see you safe at home, and I will return to your father, nor
                  leave him till he is in a place of security."</p>
               <p>"No, no!" cried Kate, "I think not of myself, only assist me to raise him, and
                  lead him home, and I care not what happens to me. I knew it would come to this at
                  last. Oh! my poor father!"</p>
               <p>Harry felt that there was no consolation for such grief, and he attempted not to
                  offer any. He put a strong arm round the unhappy man, and raised him from the
                  ground, still supporting his reeling body and calling his name in a loud,
                  commanding tone. Mr. Franklin opened his eyes with a stupid stare, and uttered
                  some indistinct, idiotic sounds, then letting his head fall on his bosom, he
                  suffered himself to be led homeward, reeling, tottering, and stumbling at every
                  step. And this man, so helpless and degraded, so imbruted and disgusting, that his
                  very daughter, who had just periled her life in the night-storm to<pb n="352-353"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000168"/> secure him from danger, and turned away from him,
                  even while she supported him, with unconquerable loathing, was a member of
                  Congress, a distinguished lawyer—eloquent at the bar, and sagacious in council—a
                  citizen respected and beloved; a friend generous and sincere—a husband once
                  idolized—a father once adored. The young man who had walked by his side, had been
                  for more than a year, a student in his office, and sat under his instruction, as
                  Paul sat at the feet of Gamaliel. Now, in the expressive language of Scripture, he
                  could have exclaimed, "Oh, Lucifer, thou son of the morning, how low art thou
                  fallen!" but he moved on in silence, interrupted occasionally by the ill-repressed
                  sobs of Kate. He had been that day to an adjoining town to transact some business
                  for Mr. Franklin, and being detained to an unusually late hour, was overtaken by
                  the storm, when the agonized voice of Kate met his ear.</p>
               <p>Harry lingered a moment at Mr. Franklin's door before he departed. He wanted to
                  say something expressive of comfort and sympathy to Kate, but he knew not what to
                  say.</p>
               <p>"You will never mention the circumstances of this night, Harry," said Kate, in a
                  low, hesitating tone. "I cannot ask you to respect my father as you have done, but
                  save him, if it may be, from the contempt of the world."</p>
               <p>"If he were my own father, Kate," cried Harry, "I would not guard his reputation
                  with more jealous care. Look upon me henceforth as a brother, and call upon me as
                  such, when you want counsel, sympathy or aid. God bless you, Kate."</p>
               <p>"Alas! there is no blessing for a drunkard's daughter," sighed Kate, as she turned
                  from the door and listened to her father's deep, sonorous breathing, from the sofa
                  on which he had staggered, and where he lay stretched at full length, till long
                  after the dawning of morn, notwithstanding her efforts to induce him to change his
                  drenched garments.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Franklin was an invalid, and consequently a late riser. Kate usually presided
                  at the breakfast table, and attended to her father's wants. This morning he took
                  his accustomed seat, but his coffee and toast remained untasted. He sat with his
                  head leaning upon his hand, his eyes fixed vacantly on the wall, and his hair
                  matted and hanging in neglected masses over his temples. Kate looked upon his
                  face, and remembered when she thought her father one of the handsomest men she had
                  ever seen—when dignity was enthroned upon his brow, and the purity as well as the
                  majesty of genius beamed from his eye. He lifted his head and encountered her
                  fixed gaze—probably followed the current of her thoughts, for his countenance
                  darkened, and pushing his cup far from him, he asked her, in a surly tone, why she
                  stared so rudely upon him?</p>
               <p>Kate tried to answer, but there was suffocation in her throat, and she could not
                  speak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Franklin looked upon her for a moment with a stern, yet wavering glance, then
                  rising and thrusting back his chair against the wall, he left the<pb n="354-355"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000169"/> house, muttering as he went, "curses not loud, but
                  deep."</p>
               <p>Kate had become gradually accustomed to the lowering cloud of sullenness, which
                  the lethargy of inebriation leaves behind it. She had heard by almost
                  imperceptible degrees, the voice of manly tenderness assume the accents of
                  querulousness and discontent; but she had never met such a glance of defiance, or
                  witnessed such an ebullition of passion before. Her heart rose in rebellion
                  against him, and she trembled at the thought that she might learn to hate him as
                  he thus went on, plunging deeper and deeper in the gulf of sensuality.</p>
               <p>"No, no, no!" repeated she to herself, "let me never be such a monster. Let me
                  pity, pray for him, love him if I can—but let me never forget that he is my father
                  still."</p>
               <p>Young as Kate was, she had learned that endurance, not happiness, was her allotted
                  portion. Naturally high-spirited and impetuous, with impassioned feelings and
                  headlong impulses, in prosperity she might have become haughty and ungovernable;
                  but subjected in early youth to a discipline, of all others the most galling to
                  her pride, her spirit became subdued, and her passions restrained by the same
                  process by which her principles were strengthened, and the powers of her mind
                  precociously developed. Her brothers and sisters had all died in infancy, except
                  one, now an infant in the cradle, a feeble, delicate child, for whom every one
                  prophesied an early grave was appointed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Franklin herself was constitutionally feeble, and yielding to the depression
                  of spirits caused by her domestic misfortunes, indulged in constant and
                  ineffectual complainings, which added to the gloom of the household, without
                  producing amendment or reformation in its degraded master. She was very proud, and
                  had been a very beautiful woman, who had felt for her husband an attachment
                  romantically strong, for it was fed by the two strongest passions of her
                  heart—pride, which exulted in the homage paid to his talents and his graces, and
                  vanity, which delighted in the influence her beauty exercised over his commanding
                  mind. Now, his talents and graces were obscured by the murky cloud of
                  intemperance, and her languishing beauty no longer received its accustomed
                  incense; the corrosions of mortification and peevish discontent became deeper and
                  deeper, and life one scene of gloom and disquietude.</p>
               <p>Kate grew up amidst these opposing influences like a beautiful plant in a barren,
                  ungenial soil. To her father, she was the delicate but hardy saxifrage, blooming
                  through the clefts of the cold, dry rock; to her mother, the sweet anemone,
                  shedding its blossoms over the roots of the tree from which it sprung—fragrant,
                  though unnurtured, neglected and alone.</p>
               <p>It would be too painful to follow, step by step, Mr. Franklin's downward course.
                  Since the night of his public exposure he had gone down, down, with a fearfully
                  accelerated motion, like the mountain stream, when it leaps over its rocky
                  barrier. Public confidence was gradually withdrawn, clients and friends<pb
                     n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6687-00000170"/> forsook him, and ruin trod rapidly on
                  the steps of shame.</p>
               <p>Harry Blake clung to him, till he saw his once powerful mind partaking so far of
                  the degradation of his body, as to be incapable of imparting light to his. He now
                  felt it due to himself to dissolve the connection subsisting between them—and he
                  called, though reluctantly, to bid him farewell. Mr. Franklin seemed much agitated
                  when Harry informed him of his intended departure. He knew the cause, and it
                  seemed as if the last link was about to be severed that bound him to the good and
                  honourable. Harry had been to him a delightful companion; and, in the days of his
                  unsullied reputation, it had been one of his most interesting tasks to direct a
                  mind so buoyant and aspiring, and which owned, with so much deference, the
                  overmastering influence of his own.</p>
               <p>"Do not go yet, Harry," said he; "I have much, much to say to you, and I may never
                  have another opportunity. I have anticipated this moment. It is painful, but
                  justice to yourself demanded it."</p>
               <p>Harry seated himself, pale from suppressed emotion, while Mr. Franklin continued
                  speaking, walking up and down the room, every feature expressive of violent
                  agitation.</p>
               <p>"I have never yet to a human being introduced the subject of which I am about to
                  speak—not even to my wife and daughter. I have never rolled back the current of
                  time, and revealed the spot where, standing on the quicksands of youth, the first
                  wave of temptation washed over me. I could not bear to allude to the history of my
                  degradation. But you, Harry, are going among strangers, amid untried scenes—and I
                  would warn you now, with the solemnity of a man who knows he has sealed his own
                  everlasting ruin, to beware of the first downward step. You do not know me, sir—no
                  one knows me; they know not my parentage, or the accursed stream that runs in
                  these veins.</p>
               <p>"My father was called the King of the Drunkards! He drank till he was transformed,
                  breath, bones, and sinew, into flame, and then he died—the most horrible of all
                  deaths—of spontaneous combustion. Yes, he was the King of the Drunkards! I
                  remember when a little boy, I saw him walking at the head of a long procession,
                  with a banner flying, as if in triumph, and a barrel of whiskey rolling before, on
                  which the drummer made music as they walked. And shouts went up in the air, and
                  people applauded from the windows and the doors—and I thought the drunkard's was a
                  merry life. But when I grew older, and saw my mother's cheek grow paler and paler,
                  and knew that my father's curses and threats, and brutal treatment were the
                  cause—when I saw her at length die of a broken heart, and heard the neighbours say
                  that my father had killed her, and that he would have to answer for her death at
                  the great bar of Heaven!—I began to feel an indescribable dread and horror, and
                  looked upon my father with loathing and abhorrence! And when he died—when his body
                  was consumed by flames, which seemed to me emblematical of the winding-sheet in
                  which his soul was wrapped—I fled<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6687-00000171"/> from
                  my native town, my native State; I begged my bread from door to door. At length, a
                  childless stranger took me in. He pitied my forlorn condition—clothed, fed, and
                  educated me. Nature had given me talents, and now opportunity unfolded them. I
                  became proud and ambitious, and I wanted to convince my benefactor that I was no
                  vulgar boy. Conscious of the dregs from which I had been extracted I was resolved
                  to make myself a name and fame—and I have done it. You know it, Harry—I have taken
                  my station in the high places of the land; and the time has been, when but to
                  announce yourself as my student, would have been your passport to distinction.
                  Well, do you want to know what made me what I am?—what, when such a burning beacon
                  was forever blazing before my memory, hurried me on to throw my own blasted frame
                  into a drunkard's dishonoured grave? I will tell you, young man—it was the
                     <emph>wine</emph> cup!—the glass offered by the hand of beauty, with smiles and
                  adulation! I had made a vow over my mother's ashes that I would never drink. I
                  prayed God to destroy me, body and soul, if I ever became a drunkard. But
                     <emph>wine,</emph> they said, was one of God's best gifts, and it gladdened
                  without inebriating—it was ingratitude to turn from its generous influence. I
                  believed them, for it was alcohol that consumed my father. And I drank wine at the
                  banquet and the board—and I drank porter and ale, and the richscented cordial—and
                  I believed myself to be a temperate man. I thought I grew more intellectual; I
                  could plead more eloquently, and my tongue made more music at the convivial feast.
                  But when the excitement of the scene was over, I felt languid and depressed. My
                  head ached, and my nerves seemed unsheathed. A thirst was enkindled within me,
                  that wine could no longer quench. A hereditary fire was burning in my veins. I had
                  lighted up the smouldering spark, and it now blazed, and blazed. I knew I was
                  destroying myself, but the power of resistance was gone. When I first tasted, I
                  was undone! Beware, Harry, beware! To save you from temptation, I have lifted the
                  veil, and laid bare before you the hell of a drunkard's bosom. But no! that cannot
                  be. The Invisible alone can witness the agonies of remorse, the corroding
                  memories, the anticipated woes, the unutterable horrors that I endure and
                  dread—and expect to endure as long as the Great God himself exists."</p>
               <p>He paused, and sunk down exhausted into a chair. Large drops of sweat rolled down
                  his livid brow—his knees knocked together, his lips writhed convulsively, every
                  muscle seemed twisted, and every vein swollen and blackened. Harry was terrified
                  at this paroxysm. He sprang toward him, and untying the handkerchief from his
                  neck, handed him a glass of water with trembling hands. Mr. Franklin looked up,
                  and meeting Harry's glance of deep commisseration, his features relaxed, and large
                  tears, slowly gathering, rolled down his cheeks. He bent forward, and extending
                  his arms across the table, laid his head on them; and deep, suffocating sobs burst
                  forth, shaking his frame, as if with strong spasms. Harry was unutterably
                  affected. He had never seen man weep thus before. He knew<pb n="360-361"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000172"/> they were tears wrung by agony, the agony of
                  remorse; and while he wept in sympathy, he gathered the hope of his regeneration
                  from the intensity of his sufferings.</p>
               <p>"I pity you, Mr. Franklin," said he, "from my soul I pity you—but you must not
                  give yourself up as lost. God never yet tempted a man beyond his strength. You
                  may, you can, you <emph>must</emph> resist. For your own sake, for your
                  wife's—your daughter's sake, I conjure you."</p>
               <p>"My daughter's!" interrupted Mr. Franklin, lifting his head. "Ah! that name
                  touches the chord that still vibrates. Poor Kate! poor Kate! The hand that should
                  have blessed has blighted her young hopes. My wife reproaches me, and gives me
                  gall and vinegar, even when I would meet her with smiles. But Kate never gave me
                  one reproach but her tears. I once thought you loved her, and that I should see
                  the two objects I most loved, happy in each other's affections, and scattering
                  roses over the pillow of my declining years. But that can never be now; your proud
                  father will never permit you to marry a drunkard's daughter." He spoke this in a
                  bitter tone, and a smile of derision for a moment curled his lips.</p>
               <p>"You thought right," exclaimed Harry, passionately. "I have loved her, I do love
                  her, as the best, the loveliest, the most exalted of human beings. I would not
                  pain you, sir, but you constrain me to speak the truth: my father has forbidden me
                  to think of such a union, and as I am now dependent on him, I could not brave his
                  commands without seeking to plunge your daughter into poverty and sorrow. Yet I
                  will not deceive you. I would have braved everything with her consent, but she
                  refuses to listen to vows, unsanctioned by parental authority. The time, I trust,
                  will come when, having secured an independence, by my energies, I may dare to
                  speak and act as a man, and woo her to be my wife in the face of the world."</p>
               <p>"Yes! yes!" repeated Mr. Franklin, "the time may come, but I shall not live to see
                  it. There is at times such a deadly faintness, such a chilly weight here," laying
                  his hand on his breast, "it seems as though I could feel the cold fingers of death
                  clutching round my heart and freezing my life-blood. If I did not warm the current
                  with fresh streams of alcohol, I should surely die. Then this aching brow, this
                  throbbing brain, these quivering nerves, and shaking limbs, are they not all the
                  heralds of coming dissolution?—Harry, I do not mean to distress you—I have but one
                  thing more to say: if you resist temptation, and I pray God you may, dare not
                  triumph over the fallen. Oh! you know not, you dream not, in the possession of
                  unclouded reason and unblighted faculties, the proud master of yourself, what that
                  wretch endures, who, beset by demons on every side, feels himself dragged down
                  lower and lower, incapable of resistance, to the very verge of the bottomless
                  pit."</p>
               <p>He wrung Harry's hand in his, then turned and left the office. Harry followed,
                  oppressed and awe-struck by the revelations he had heard. Temptation, sin, sorrow,
                  disgrace, death, judgment, and eternity, swept like dark phantoms across his mind;
                  chasing away hope, love, joy, and heaven; even the image of Kate<pb n="362-363"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000173"/> Franklin flitted mournfully in the back-ground,
                  fading and indistinct as a vanishing rainbow.</p>
               <p>Kate grieved at Harry's departure, but it was a grief which vented itself in
                  tears. She was affected by his disinterested attachment; she esteemed his virtues
                  and admired his character, and in sunnier hours she might have indulged in those
                  sweet day-dreams of love, which throw over the realities of life the hues of
                  heaven. But she felt it was hers to endure and to struggle, not to enjoy—she dared
                  not fix her gaze on the single star that shone through the dark clouds closing
                  around her, lest it should charm her into a forgetfulness of the perils and duties
                  of her situation; so gathering all her energies, as the traveller folds his mantle
                  over his breast to shield him from the tempest, the more fearful the storm, the
                  more firm and strong became her powers of resistance. It was summer when Harry
                  departed, and Kate, though she never mentioned his name, found his remembrance
                  associated with the flowers, the fragrance, and the moonlight of that beautiful
                  season; but when winter came on, with its rough gales, and sleet and snow—for she
                  lived on the granite hills of New England, where the snow-spirit revels amid
                  frost-work and ice—she sat by a lonely fire, watching her father's late return, or
                  nursing the fretful and delicate babe in her mother's chamber, all the anticipated
                  ills of poverty hanging darkly over her, Kate found her only comfort in communing
                  with her God, to whom, in the dearth of all earthly joy, she had turned for
                  support and consolation, and as her religious faith increased, her fortitude
                  strengthened, and her stern duties became easier of performance. One night she sat
                  alone by the fireside—and it was a most tempestuous night, the wind howled and
                  tossed the naked boughs of the trees against the windows, which rattled as if they
                  would shiver in the blast; and the snow, drifted by its violence, blew in white
                  wreaths on the glass and hung its chill drapery on the walls. She sat on a low
                  seat in the corner, her Bible on her knees, a dim fire burning on the hearth, for
                  cold as it was, she would not suffer it to be replenished with fuel which her
                  mother might yet want for her own comfort. She was gradually accustoming herself
                  to personal privations, voluntarily abstaining from every luxury, not knowing how
                  soon she might need the necessaries of life. She was reading the sublime book of
                  Job, and when she came to the words, "Hast thou entered into the snow? Hast thou
                  seen the treasures of the hail?" she repeated them aloud, struck with the force,
                  mid the wintry scene around her. At this moment her father entered. It was an
                  unusually early hour for his return, and as he walked forward she noticed with joy
                  that his step was less fluctuating than usual. He bent shivering over the fire,
                  which Kate immediately kindled afresh, and a bright blaze soon diffused warmth and
                  cheerfulness through the apartment.</p>
               <p>"I heard your voice as I entered, Kate," said he; "where is your companion?"</p>
               <p>"There," answered she, lifting the Bible from her knees—"here is the companion of
                  my solitude, and a very pleasing one I find it."</p>
               <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6687-00000174"/>
               <p>Mr. Franklin fixed his eyes steadfastly on Kate for a few moments, throwing
                  himself back in his chair, gazed upon the ceiling, and spoke as in a
                  soliloquy—</p>
               <p>"I remember when I was a little boy, reading that book at my mother's knee, and
                  when she was dying she told me never to lay my head upon the pillow without
                  reading a chapter and praying to the Great God for pardon and protection. But that
                  was a long time ago. I would not open it now for the universe."</p>
               <p>"Oh! father!" exclaimed Kate, "do not say so. Young as I am, I have lived too long
                  if the promises written here be not true. They alone have saved me from
                  despair."</p>
               <p>"Despair!" repeated he, in a hollow tone—"yes, that is the fitting word, but it
                  belongs to me alone. You are innocent and virtuous, and why should you talk of
                  despair? You have no brand on your brow, no thunder-scar graven by the Almighty's
                  hand, from which men turn away, and women shrink from with horror. I am an object
                  of loathing and scorn to all. Even you, my own daughter, who once lived in my
                  bosom, if I should open my arms to enfold you, as I was wont to do, would shrink
                  from me, as from the leper's touch."</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, no!" cried Kate, springing from her seat, and throwing her arms
                  impulsively around his neck, while her tears literally rained on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>It had been long months since she had heard such a gush of tenderness from his
                  lips—since she had dared to proffer the caresses of affection. She thought all
                  natural feeling was dried up in his heart—withered, scorched by the fiery breath
                  of intemperance. She had locked her grief and humiliation in her own breast. She
                  believed every appeal to her reason and sensibility would be as unavailing as if
                  made to the granite of her native hills. She now reproached herself for her
                  coldness and reserve. She accused herself of neglect and irreverence.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my father!" she exclaimed, "if you still love me I will not despair. There is
                  hope, there will be joy. You have but to make one great effort, and you will be
                  free once more. Chains, strong as adamant, cannot bind the soul to sin, unless it
                  is a willing captive. You are wretched now; we are all wretched. No smiles gladden
                  our household. My mother lies on a bed of languishment, where a breaking heart has
                  laid her. My little sister pines like a flower, which sunbeams never visited; and
                  I—oh, father! words can never tell the wo, the anguish, the agony, which I have
                  pent up in my bosom, till it threatened to destroy me. I would not reproach you—I
                  would not add one drop to your cup of bitterness—but I must speak now, or I
                  die."</p>
               <p>Excited beyond her power of self-control, Kate slid from her father's relaxing
                  arms, and taking the Bible, which lay upon her chair, in both hands, prostrated
                  herself at his feet.</p>
               <p>"By this blessed book," continued she, in an exalted voice, "this book which has
                  poured oil and balsam in my bleeding heart, this book, so rich in promises, so
                  fearful in threatenings—by the God who created you to glorify Him, the Saviour who
                  died to<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6687-00000175"/> redeem you—by your immortal and
                  endangered soul—I pray thee to renounce the fatal habit, which has transformed our
                  once blissful home into a prison-house of shame, sorrow, and despair."</p>
               <p>She paused, breathless from intense emotion, but her uplifted hands still clasped
                  the sacred volume; her cheek glistening with tears, was mantled with crimson; and
                  her eyes, turned up to her father, beamed with the inspiration of the Christian's
                  hope.</p>
               <p>Mr. Franklin looked down upon his daughter, as she thus knelt before him, and it
                  seemed as if a ray from the Divine intelligence darted like a glory from her eyes
                  into the depths of his soul. Lost, ruined as he was, there was still hope of his
                  redemption. He might be saved. She, like a guiding cherub, might still take him by
                  the hand, and lead him back to the green paths of pellucid streams where he had
                  once walked with undoubting footsteps. As these thoughts rolled through his mind,
                  he bent forward, lower and lower, till his knees touched the floor. He wrapped his
                  arms around Kate, and, leaning his head on her shoulder, sobbed aloud. The prayer
                  of the publican trembled on his lips—"Oh, my God! have mercy upon me, a miserable
                  sinner! Oh, Thou who was once tempted, yet never sinned, save me from
                  temptation!"</p>
               <p>It was long before other sounds interrupted the hallowed silence which succeeded.
                  Kate hardly dared to breathe, lest she should disturb the communion her father's
                  soul was holding with the being he invoked. Her heart ached with the fulness of
                  hope that flowed into it from channels long sealed. Had he made promises of
                  amendment in his own strength, she might have feared their stability, but now,
                  when she saw him prostrate in the dust, in tears and humiliation, crying for mercy
                  from the depths of a wounded and contrite spirit, she believed that He, "whose fan
                  is in His hand," had come to winnow the chaff from the wheat, before the whole
                  should be consumed with unquenchable fire.</p>
               <p>It was midnight before she rose to retire to her chamber. She felt unwilling to
                  leave her father. It seemed to her that this night was the crisis of her
                  destiny—that angels and demons were wrestling for his soul—that the angels had
                  prevailed; but might not the demons return? or the good angels, too sure of their
                  victory, wing their way back to the skies? Long after she had retired to bed, she
                  heard him walk backwards and forwards, and sometimes she heard his voice ascending
                  as in prayer.</p>
               <p>"Hear him, gracious Father!" cried she, from her moistened pillow, "hear him,
                  answer and bless him!"</p>
               <p>Then folding her arms closely round the infant, who slumbered by her side, she
                  gradually fell asleep, and it will throw no shade over her filial piety to believe
                  that no one thought of Henry Blake, associated with pure images of future
                  felicity, gilded her dreams. How long she slept, she knew not; but she awoke with
                  a strange feeling of suffocation, and, starting up in bed, looked wildly around
                  her. She saw nothing, but the chamber seemed filled with smoke, and a hollow,
                  crackling sound met her ear. The dread of fire<pb n="368-369"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000176"/> for a moment paralyzed her limbs. It was but a
                  moment—when springing from her bed, the infant still cradled on her arm, she
                  opened the door, and found the terrible reality of her fears. Such a rush of hot
                  air pressed upon her, she staggered back, panting and bewildered. The flames were
                  rolling in volumes through the next apartment, and the wind, blowing in violence
                  through the outer door, which was open, fearfully accelerated the work of
                  destruction.</p>
               <p>"My father!" shrieked Kate; "my father!—where is he?"</p>
               <p>That fearful cry awoke the child, who screamed and clung in terror closer to her
                  bosom; but her mother, who seldom slept except under the influence of powerful
                  opiates, lay still unmoved, unconscious of the terrific element which was raging
                  around her.</p>
               <p>"Mother!" cried Kate, franticly, "wake or you die! The house is in flames!—they
                  are rolling towards us!—they are coming! Oh! my God—mother, awake!"</p>
               <p>She shook her arm with violence, and shrieked in her ear; but, though she moved
                  and spoke, she seemed in a lethargy so deep, that nothing could rouse her to a
                  sense of her danger.</p>
               <p>The flames began to curl their forked tongues around the very door of the chamber,
                  and the house shook and quivered as if with the throes of an earthquake. Kate knew
                  she could make her own escape through a door, in an opposite direction; but she
                  resolved, if she could not save her mother, to perish with her. She would have her
                  lifted in her arms, were it not for the infant clinging to her bosom. Perchance
                  that infant might be saved. She rushed through the door, made her way through the
                  drifting snow to the street, laid the child down on the chill but soft bank by the
                  wall-side, silently commending it to the protection of God,—then winged her way
                  back to the building, though the flames were now bursting from the roof, and
                  reddening the snow with their lurid glare.</p>
               <p>"Mother, dear mother, speak if you live," cried Kate, shuddering at the
                  supernatural sounds of her own voice. A faint groan issued from the bed, round
                  which the flames were rapidly gathering. It is astonishing what strength is given
                  by desperation. Kate was a slender girl, of delicate frame, unused to physical
                  exertion, but now she felt nerved with a giant's strength. She took up her mother
                  in her arms, just as the fire caught the bed curtain, and communicated even to her
                  night-dress. Smothering the blaze with the blanket she had dragged from the bed in
                  rescuing her mother, she flew rather than walked, burdened as she was, the flames
                  roaring and hissing behind her, gaining upon her at every step—the hot air almost
                  stifling her breath, even while her naked feet were plunging through the snow
                  drifts, and the frosts penetrating her thin night wrapper. It seemed as if ages of
                  thought and feeling were compressed in that awful moment. Her father's dreaded
                  fate—her little sister freezing on the snow—the servants probably perishing in the
                  flames—her houseless mother fainting in her arms—her own desolate condition—all
                  was as vividly impressed on her mind as the lurid blaze of the conflagration on
                  the dark grey of the wintry night. She<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6687-00000177"/>
                  bent her steps to the nearest dwelling, which was the residence of Mr. Blake, the
                  father of Harry. She reached the threshold, and fell with her now senseless
                  burden, heavily against the door. She tried to call aloud for assistance, but no
                  sound issued from her parched and burning lips. She endeavored to lift her right
                  hand to the knocker, but it was numb and powerless, and in her left, which
                  encircled her mother, she felt for the first time the most intense pain.</p>
               <p>"Merciful Father!" thought she, "thou who has sustained us thus far, leave us not
                  to perish!"</p>
               <p>Even while this prayer burst from her soul, footsteps approached, the door opened,
                  and Mr. Blake, accompanied by a servant, bearing a lamp, stood upon the threshold.
                  He had been awakened a few minutes before by the reflection of the blaze in his
                  chamber, and had just aroused his family, when the sudden jarring of the door
                  excited his alarm. He recoiled at first with horror from the spectacle which he
                  beheld, Mrs. Franklin, white, ghastly and still, lay to all appearance dead, in
                  the nerveless arms of her daughter, who, pale, prostrate, and voiceless, could
                  only lift her imploring eyes, and moan the supplication her lips vainly sought to
                  express. Mr. Blake had forbidden his son to marry a <emph>drunkard's
                     daughter,</emph> and he had looked coldly on Kate, secretly condemning her for
                  the influence she unconsciously exercised over his destiny. But he was not a
                  hard-hearted man, though very proud, and his wife was a repository of heaven's own
                  influences. Under her anxious superintendence, the sufferers were soon placed in
                  warm beds, and every means used for the resuscitation of the one, and the
                  renovation of the other, while Mr. Blake, with the male part of the household,
                  hastened to the scene of the conflagration. The main building was now enveloped in
                  fire, but the kitchen was still standing, and he rejoiced to see the servants
                  rushing to and fro, trying to save something, perhaps their own property, from the
                  ruins. He looked around in search of the unhappy master, and trembled at the
                  supposition that he might have found a funeral pyre. There was nothing to be
                  done—the work of destruction was almost consummated, and he was turning away sick
                  at heart, when he thought he saw a bundle lying near the wall where he stood. He
                  stooped down, and beheld with astonishment a sleeping infant. At first he thought
                  it dead, but when he raised it, and touched his cheek to its cold face, he felt
                  its sweet breath stealing softly over his lips, and its little hand instinctively
                  clasped his neck. He was inexpressibly affected, and gathering the folds of his
                  cloak around it, he pressed it to his bosom with a father's tenderness. Never had
                  he been so struck with the special providence of God, as in the preservation of
                  this little outcast. Angels must have brooded over it, and impressed their
                  heavenly warmth upon its chilly bed. But who had laid it so tenderly in its snowy
                  cradle, aloof from the smoke and the blaze? Who but she whose filial arms had
                  borne her mother to his own door! As he answered this interrogation to himself,
                  his heart smote him for his injustice to the heroic girl who had made such
                  unparalleled exertions. He almost wished Harry<pb n="372-373"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000178"/> was at home—but this was a moment of excitement;
                  when he became calmer, he rejoiced at his absence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Franklin had not perished in the ruins. After Kate had left him, his newly
                  awakened feelings of remorse raged with frenzy in his bosom. No longer soothed by
                  his daughter's caresses, and sustained by her prayers, the blackness of despair
                  rolled over him. He could not compose himself to rest—the room seemed too small to
                  contain the mighty conflict of his feelings. He could not bear to look upon the
                  blazing hearth, and feel the fires raging within. He went to the door, and as the
                  cold wind blew on his brow, he felt inexpressible relief, and leaving the door
                  unlatched, he rushed abroad, reckless where he went, provided he could escape from
                  himself. The farther he roamed from his own home, the more he seemed to lose the
                  consciousness of his own identity, till exhausted in body and mind, he threw
                  himself down on the floor of an uninhabited dwelling, which had often been the
                  scene of his drunken orgies. There he lay, while the fire which he left blazing on
                  the hearth, fanned by the blast howling through the open door, reveled
                  uncontrolled and unconquerable. When at morning he sought his homestead, he found
                  it a heap of smouldering ruins—and he knew the work of destruction was his. He
                  remembered how the door creaked in the blast, and in his madness he would not
                  return. While he stood gazing in speechless agony on the wreck, Mr. Blake
                  approached, and taking him by the arm, drew him to his own dwelling. Like the
                  friends of Job, he spoke not, for "he saw his grief was very great." His wife,
                  whom he had once tenderly loved, and who, in his chastened mood, came back to his
                  memory, clothed in all the sweetness of which his vices had robbed her, lay on her
                  deathbed. Though rescued by filial devotion from a fiery grave, she had swallowed
                  the breath of the flames, and her chafed and wounded spirit was passing into the
                  presence of her Maker. She could not speak, but she knew him as he entered, and
                  stretching out her feeble hand, her dying glance spoke only pity and forgiveness.
                  The unhappy man knelt by her side, and burying his face in the bed-cover, gave way
                  to a burst of anguish, that was like the rending asunder of body and soul. And
                  Kate, too, lay there by the side of her dying mother, with frozen feet, blistered
                  hands, and feverish brow—with her bright locks scorched and disheveled—her eyes
                  bloodshot and dim. This, too, was <emph>his</emph> work. There are calamities
                  which come immediately from the hand of God, and man bows in weakness before the
                  majesty of the power that overwhelms him. The pestilence that walketh in
                  darkness—the tempest that wasteth at noonday—the earthquake—the flood—are
                  ministers of his vengeance, and come clothed with an authority so high and sacred,
                  the boldest and strongest dare not rebel. But when the sufferer stands amid ruin
                  his own hand has wrought—when conscience tells him he has arrogated to himself the
                  fearful work of destruction, and stolen and winged the darts of death—there is an
                  unfathomable wo, an immedicable wound, an undying remorse—an antepast on earth of
                  the retributions of<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6687-00000179"/> heaven. Let no one
                  say the horrors of intemperance are exaggerated! Here fire and death had done
                  their part, but murder had not yet reddened the black catalogue of sin. Happy,
                  comparatively happy, the inebriate who is arrested in his headlong career, before
                  the blood of innocence, mingling with the libations of Bacchus, brands him with
                  the curse of Cain—the indelible stamp of infamy, which his own life, poured out on
                  the scaffold, cannot efface, and which is handed down an inalienable heritage, to
                  his children's children.</p>
               <p>The day after the remains of the ill-fated Mrs. Franklin were consigned to the
                  grave, the citizens of the place assembled in the town hall, to make arrangements
                  for the relief of the suffering family. Their sympathies were strongly excited in
                  behalf of the heroine, Kate—and in the hour of his calamity they remembered Mr.
                  Franklin as he was in his high and palmy days, when his voice had so often filled
                  the hall where they were met, with strains of the loftiest eloquence. They had
                  seen him prostrated on the grave of his wife, in sorrow that refused consolation,
                  and they felt towards him something of that tenderness which we feel for the
                  dead—when vice is recollected with compassion rather than hatred, and scorn melts
                  in forgiveness. Warmed by a common impulse, they contributed munificently, and
                  made immediate preparations for the erection of a new building on the site of the
                  old. Mr. Frankln, who was aware of their movements, entered the hall before they
                  separated. It had been long since he had met his former friends, associated in
                  such a respectable able body, and a few days before he would have shrunk from
                  their glances, conscious of his degraded condition. Now, strengthened by a solemn
                  resolution, he came among them, and standing in their midst, he begged permission
                  to address them a few moments. He began with the history of his boyhood, and told
                  them his parentage, his flight, his temptation, his perjury, and guilt. His voice
                  was at first faltering, but as he proceeded, it recovered much of its former
                  richness of tone, and when he painted his remorse and despair, his solemn
                  resolutions of amendment, and his trust in Almighty God for strength to fulfil
                  them, his eloquence rose to the most thrilling sublimity.</p>
               <p>"For myself," said he, in conclusion, "I would have asked nothing—hoped nothing. I
                  would have buried in the deepest solitude the memory of my shame. But I have
                  children—a daughter worthy of a better fate. For her sake I solicit the
                  restoration of that confidence I have so justly forfeited—the birthright I have so
                  shamefully sold. Low as I have sunk, I I feel by the effort I have this moment
                  made, that the indwelling Deity has not yet quite forsaken this polluted temple. I
                  am still capable of being master of myself, and with God's help I will be so. I
                  ask not for the hand of fellowship and friendship. I want it not till time shall
                  have proved the sincerity of my reformation, and purified from defilement the
                  drunkard's name."</p>
               <p>Here every hand was simultaneusly extended, in token of reviving confidence. Some
                  grasped his in<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6687-00000180"/> silence and tears—others
                  fervently bid him God-speed, and promised him encouragement, sympathy and
                  patronage.</p>
               <p>The introduction of a household scene—more than a twelve-month after this—will
                  close the history of The Drunkard's Daughter. Mr. Franklin was seated by his own
                  fireside, reading; and when he raised his clear, dark eye from the book, and cast
                  it on the domestic group at his side, you could read in his untroubled glance,
                  quietude, self-respect, and confidence. The red signet of intemperance was swept
                  from his noble brow; every look bore witness to his intellectual and moral
                  regeneration. Kate sat near him—she, who, in the hands of God, had been made the
                  instrument of his salvation—bearing on her youthful and lovely person a sad
                  memento of her father's sin. Her left hand lay useless in her lap; its sinews had
                  been contracted by the fires she smothered, when snatching her mother from the
                  flames, and she was destined to carry through life a witness of filial heroism and
                  devotion. But her right hand was clapsed in that of Harry Blake, who, sanctioned
                  by parental authority, had sought and received her wedded vows. Kate refused for a
                  long time to assume the sacred duties of a wife, conscious of her impaired
                  usefulness, but Harry pleaded most eloquently, and Harry's father declared that he
                  considered the cause of her dependence as a mark of glory and honor. He had
                  forbidden his son to claim alliance with a degraded name, but Kate had proved,
                  during her sojourn in his dwelling, that a daughter's virtues could redeem a
                  father's shame. Kate soon learned to be reconciled to a misfortune, which only
                  endeared her the more to the hearts of her friends. She forgot to mourn over her
                  physical dependence, in a father's and husband's devoted love. But, though
                  dependent, she was not passive. She shared in all their intellectual pursuits,
                  read for them, wrote for them, when weary from professional toils, and all that
                  her right hand found to do, "she did diligently and in order." She was their
                  inspiring companion, their modest counsellor, their spiritual friend.</p>
               <p>There was one more figure added to this domestic scene. A fair-haired child sat on
                  Mr. Franklin's knee, and twisted her chubby fingers in his still raven hair. It
                  was the child once cradled on the snowy bed, whose blooming cheeks and bright lips
                  corresponded more with the <emph>rose-bud,</emph> than the <emph>snow-drop,</emph>
                  the pet name she bore.</p>
               <p>"Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God," or having once yielded
                  to the power of the tempter, that, like the giant slumbering in the lap of
                  Delilah, he cannot break the green withs with which his passions have bound him,
                  and find in after years the shorn locks of his glory clustering once more around
                  his brow.</p>

               <head>Father Hilario, the Catholic.</head>
               <p>THE history of Father Hilario is not a tale of fiction, invented to excite the
                  sympathy of the reader. It has its foundation in truth, and needs no false
                  auxiliaries to enhance its affecting interest. Imagination may have slightly
                  embellished some of the minor incidents of his life, but his character stands
                  forth in the simple majesty of reality, and the decorations of fancy, like the
                  light garland thrown round the marble bust, could neither change its noble
                  lineaments nor exalt its classic beauty. The beautiful village of L——, situated in
                  one of the loveliest regions of Spanish Flanders, was the residence of this pure
                  and holy minded Catholic. It was not the place of his nativity, nor has tradition
                  told the land of his birth, or the events of his earlier years. He came to the
                  peaceful valley, commissioned to watch over the souls of the people, and to break
                  to them the bread of Heaven. They received with enthusiasm a pastor, who seemed
                  anointed by the Deity itself for his divine office. There was a silent
                  acknowledgment in every eye that beheld him, that he was a being of superior
                  order, apparently moulded of purer clay, and fitted for nobler purposes than the
                  grosser multitude. At first there was more awe than affection in the feelings he
                  inspired. From his habits of rigorous self denial, his air of deep devotion, his
                  love of hermit solitude, they regarded him rather as a saint than a man. It seemed
                  that he held high and invisible communion with nature in her secret places, her
                  pathless woods, her virgin bowers, and by the banks of her silent streams. So
                  constant were his solitary excursions, he was called the wanderer of the forest,
                  or sometimes by a holier appellation, the <emph>angel of the grove.</emph> Some
                  children once, urged by the restless curiosity of childhood, traced his path and
                  concealed themselves in a thick cluster of trees, where they could watch his
                  movements unperceived. Scarcely able to repress their glee at the success of the
                  juvenile scheme, their young eyes pierced through the intervening foliage, but
                  mirth was chastened into awe, when they beheld him prostrate on his kness, his
                  locked hands lifted towards heaven, and an expression in his upturned eyes so deep
                  and solemn, as to strike them with superstitious dread. They imagined they saw a
                  halo round his brow, such as encircled the heads of their tutelar saints, and ever
                  afterwards they designated him as the <emph>angel of the grove.</emph> There was
                  one of this young group, on whom the impression made by this glimpse of holiness
                  was ineffaceable. Whenever she bent in prayer by her parent's knee, or at the
                  altar of her God, that kneeling form and upturned brow, invested with such
                  beatific radiance, rose between her and the heaven to which her orisons were
                  addressed, till she associated it with her every idea of that invisible glory
                  which no eye can see and live.</p>
               <p>Father Hilario was gradually looked upon as something more approachable and human.
                  The children, who had been terrified by his appearance of unearthly sanctity,
                  became accustomed to the benign expression<pb n="380-381"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000182"/> of his countenance, as they met him in their daily
                  walks, and, won by the omnipotent charm of goodness, would often forsake their
                  sports, gather round him in his solitude, and listen in breathless silence, while
                  he talked to them of the God who made, and the Saviour who redeemed them.
                  Sometimes with a gush of tenderness, that seemed irrepressible, he would take them
                  in his arms, and weep over them tears as gentle as those which the mother sheds
                  over her newborn babe. They knew not the fountain of his tears, but they had an
                  intuitive conviction that they were holy drops, and like the unconscious flower,
                  which opens its chalice to the dew, each innocent heart drank in their heavenly
                  influence. The children repeated in their homes the words of Father Hilario. They
                  said his voice was sweet as the first notes of the birds in the spring; that his
                  eyes were gentle, and as bright as the sun when he looks over the western hills.
                  Parents followed the steps of their children, and sat at the feet of the man of
                  God, listening with childlike docility, while he pointed out to them that luminous
                  path, which shines up through the darkness of earth, to the regions of perfect
                  day. The aged sought his instructions, and it was a touching sight to see many a
                  head, hoary with the snows of time, bent meekly before him, who convinced them
                  their white locks were a crown of glory, if bowed in penitence and humility at the
                  foot of the cross. Profaneness sealed its bold lips in the presence of a being so
                  immaculate. Scepticism abandoned its doubts, as it looked upon one who seemed the
                  embodied spirit of that religion, attested tested by the blood of martyred saints,
                  and Christianity itself appeared, arrayed in new and renovated charms.</p>
               <p>Was Father Hilario <emph>old</emph>—and were those silver cords which bind us to
                  earth beginning to loosen, that he thus offered himself a living sacrifice unto
                  God? No! he was still in the glowing prime of manhood; and, as if the Creator had
                  willed, in this instance, to unite the perfection of the material and spiritual
                  beauty, he had formed him in his divinest mould. Had the soul been enshrined in a
                  meaner temple, it may be questioned if it had ever attracted so many worshippers,
                  and it is to be feared that some, who came to offer incense to the
                     <emph>Creator,</emph> paid as deep a homage to the <emph>creature,</emph> so
                  nobly adorned. It has been said by one of his cotemporaries, that there never was
                  a more imposing or interesting figure than Father Hilario presented when he stood
                  before the altar in his robes of priesthood, apparently unconscious of every eye,
                  save that which is unseen, his sable hair, shading a brow of marble purity—a brow
                  where devotion sat enthroned, unmolested by the demons of earth-born passion. It
                  was even averred by some, and the remark was uttered with reverence, that they
                  could trace a striking resemblance between the officiating priest and the features
                  of the Master whom he served, whose lineaments were emblazoned by the altar's
                  sacred lights. There was, indeed, a similitude. Like that divine Master, he was
                  destined to bow beneath the cross of human suffering, and to drain to its dregs
                  the cup of agony and humiliation.</p>
               <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6687-00000183"/>
               <p>Years, however, passed on in this blessed tranquility. We spoke of
                     <emph>one</emph> child, on whom the impression made by the glimpse of Father
                  Hilario in the fervency of prayer, was deep and enduring. That child, then older
                  than her juvenile companions, was now in her girlhood, and was acknowldged, even
                  by her rivals, the fairest flower in the gardens of L——. Her real name has not
                  been preserved in the annals of this history. It matters not—we will call her
                  Leila. The word conveys an idea of loveliness and fragility; and is appropriate to
                  her, who, like the lily of the field, was transcendent in delicacy and sweetness.
                  There was something about this young maiden so different from the usual
                  characteristics of her age, that the eye of the stranger involuntarily rested on
                  her face, and read there the indications of a higher, and perchance, a sadder
                  destiny, than that of her blooming fellows, she was beautiful, but pale as the
                  wild flower to which we just resembled her, save when some sudden emotion passed
                  into her mind, the lightning that plays on the summer's evening cloud, is not more
                  brilliant or evanescent than the colours that then flitted over her cheek. Her
                  eyes—she seemed born to remind one of all that is lovely and perishing—had the
                  deep hue of the mountain violet; and, like their modest emblem, had a natural
                  bending towards the earth; but when they were directed towards heaven, as they
                  oftentimes were, there was a holy illumination diffused over her face, like that
                  which is seen on the countenance of the virgin mother, when she is represented as
                  listening to the songs of the angels. She was an only child, and her parents, as
                  they saw her in her innocence and beauty, shrinking from the gaities and
                  amusements of youth, and devoting herself to meditation and prayer, felt a kind of
                  prophetic gloom steal over their minds, and, though they never gave utterance to
                  their forebodings, they feared that one so fair and spiritual would not long be
                  suffered to dwell on earth. An unpolluted blossom, the heavenly instructions of
                  Father Hilario, were the sun and dew of her existence. While her more joyous
                  companions followed the impulses of their blithe spirits, she sat, a young
                  disciple, at the feet of this Gamaliel; and when he talked to her of divine
                  things, till her soul kindled into ecstasy, she was unconscious that one spark of
                  earthly fire mingled with the flame that was glowing within. She would have shrunk
                  with horror from the sacrilegious thought of <emph>loving</emph> the anointed of
                  the Lord, the Apostle, the Saint—she believed herself superior to human passion,
                  and when sought in wedlock, for young as she was, she had already inspired in
                  others, what she imagined she was destined never herself to feel; she would answer
                  that "she wished to be the bride of her Redeemer only." Alas! she knew not that
                  she had placed an earthly idol in the sanctuary of her heart, that temple which
                  she had solemnly dedicated to the living God. But the veil was yet to be rent
                  away, and the temple to become desolate and dim. Before the further development of
                  the story, it will be necessary to introduce two characters, who were conspicuous
                  actors in some of its darkest scenes.</p>
               <p>When the inhabitants of L—— were first placed<pb n="384-385"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000184"/> under the pastoral guardianship of Father Hilario,
                  there were two youths, who had gained "bad eminence" in society, as rebels against
                  its salutary restraints. Murillo, the eldest, had one of those subtle, designing
                  spirits, which loved to work in ambush, to hurl the shafts of mischief from behind
                  some sheltering cloud, and laugh at the consternation they excited. Guido was bold
                  and lawless. He would stand forth in the broad sunshine and commit the most daring
                  depredations, entirely reckless of their consequences. Yet there was a mixture of
                  openness and generosity which often exerted their redeeming influence on his
                  character. Unfortunately, exposed to the evil example of Murillo, he suffered from
                  that moral contagion which the purest and firmest have been unable to resist. The
                  inventive wickedness of the former exercised a mastery over him, which he was
                  ashamed to acknowledge, but to which he involuntarily yielded. About the period to
                  which we allude, they entered by stealth, into the church, and desecrated the
                  altar, by the most unhallowed hieroglyphics; then mingling with the throng who
                  came to worship there, watched with eager scrutiny the effect of their impious
                  ingenuity. Father Hilario felt the insult as a Christian, rather than as a man. He
                  saw every eye directed to the offending characters, and, wishing to give an awful
                  lesson to the perpetrators of such a crime, he came forward, with a majesty he had
                  never before assumed, and in the name of outraged Christianity, commanded the
                  authors of the deed, if within the reach of his voice, to cast themselves before
                  that very altar they had profaned, and, with tears of repentance, wash out the
                  foul stains they had made. Guido felt as if thunderstruck by the unexpected
                  appeal. The sacrilege of the act, for the first time, glared upon his conscience,
                  and following the impulse of his headstrong and ungovernable nature, he forced his
                  passage through the crowd, threw himself on his knees before Father Hilario, and
                  declared himself one of the offenders. He did not betray his comrade; but Murillo
                  was too notorious not to be known as his accomplice. Murillo, however, asserted
                  his innocence, with a countenance so imperturable, and a voice so firm, it was
                  almost impossible to doubt his truth. When the boys next encountered each other on
                  the village green, Murillo assailed the penitent with every expression of scorn
                  and indignation.</p>
               <p>"You have not the spirit of a man in you," he exclaimed, "pitiful coward that you
                  are, to be frightened by the threats of a canting priest. You have wit enough in
                  your brains for the invention of mischief, but not courage enough in your soul to
                  carry it into execution."</p>
               <p>"I had rather be a coward than a liar," retorted Guido, contemptuously. "I tell
                  you to your face, Murillo, you are both; and I desire no more fellowship with one
                  whom I despise." He turned his back as he spoke, and walked several paces from the
                  exasperated Murillo, who pursued him with bitter imprecations.</p>
               <p>"You are a base-born wretch, and you know it," cried Murillo, "deny it if you
                  can—resent it if you dare."</p>
               <pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6687-00000185"/>
               <p>Guido felt the taunt to his heart's core. There was a mystery attending his birth,
                  which made his claim to legitimacy somewhat doubtful; but, as his mother had
                  expiated her frailty with her life, the shade that darkened her fame did not long
                  obscure the opening manhood of her son. There were few who were unfeeling enough
                  to stigmatize, in his presence, the parent who was now beyond the reach of human
                  obloquy and shame. With flashing eyes and boiling blood, Guido turned upon the
                  insulter, and, seizing a stone which unfortunately lay within his reach, he dashed
                  it into his face. Murillo fell to the ground apparently lifeless, while the blood
                  issued in torrents from his wounded head. Guido stood over him, aghast at the
                  consequences of his rashness. He believed himself a murderer, and gazed in agony
                  of remorse and horror upon the pale, bleeding form extended before him. The wound,
                  however, did not prove mortal. After suffering excruciating tortures, and
                  lingering long in a state of painful debility, he was at last restored to his
                  wonted vigour. But one of his eyes—and they were singularly bright—was
                  extinguished for ever, and a terrible scar on the temple disfigured the beauty of
                  a face, which, in spite of the absence of every moral charm, was once eminently
                  handsome. It may well be believed that Murillo, with his vindictive and irascible
                  temper, never, in his heart, forgave the one who had thus marred his features, and
                  cheated them "of their fair proportions." He had been particularly vain of the
                  fiery brilliancy of his eyes, and he felt that the glory of his countenance was
                  departed, and a blighting mark set upon him to make him an object of pity or
                  derision to a gazing world. As the young tree, riven by the lightning's stroke,
                  stands scathed and barren in the midst of abounding verdure, he remained gloomy
                  and dark in the social band, the few generous affections with which nature had
                  gifted him, blasted by the withering consciousness of personal deformity. Guido,
                  whose better feelings had been awakened by the solemn admonitions of Father
                  Hilario, and whose remorse for the injury he had inflicted was keen as the
                  resentment that dictated the act, and lasting as its consequences, exerted every
                  energy and every art to soften the hatred of Murillo, and indemnify him for the
                  wrong he had done, but in vain—years passed on, still Murillo's solitary eye
                  scowled indignantly by the grave of its fellow whenever it turned upon the
                  unfortunate Guido. Another circumstance served to widen the chasm which separated
                  them. While they were advancing deeper into manhood, the juvenile charms of Leila
                  were assuming the more seductive graces of womanhood, and the hearts of both
                  acknowledged her inspiration. There was nothing strange in this. It would seem as
                  natural to love, nay, as impossible <emph>not</emph> to love such a being as
                  Leila, as to look upon a rose in the dewy freshness of its bloom, without wishing
                  to inhale its fragrance and gather it from its bower. Her perfect unconsciousness
                  of her own loveliness, her indifference to admiration, the elevation and sanctity
                  of her character, rendered it difficult for one to address her in the language of
                  earthly passion. But Guido emboldened<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6687-00000186"/>
                  himself to declare the homage she inspired, though he anticipated the denial she
                  gave.</p>
               <p>"I would devote myself to God," she answered; and she looked so heavenly when she
                  uttered the words, he almost convinced himself he had a second time been guilty of
                  profaneness, in aspiring to one so saintlike and pure. As for Murillo, his love
                  partook of all that was dark and fierce in a character, whose passions were strong
                  and untameable as the elements. Once, in a moment of uncontrollable excitement, he
                  revealed to her the strength and depth of emotions he had long smothered in his
                  breast, where they burned with the intenseness of nature's central fires. She
                  shrunk from him in terror she had not the power to conceal, and his proud heart
                  chafed almost to madness in his bosom. He remembered the promise of his boyhood,
                  before any defacing touch had swept out the lines of symmetry and beauty, and he
                  cursed Guido in his secret soul, as the author of his misery and degradation.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It was the depth of summer. Every thing wore that aspect of almost oppressive
                  magnificence and intensity of hue peculiar to the season, which elicits the latent
                  glories of nature, while it deadens the strength and energy of man. The earth
                  began to pant for one of those liberal showers, which come down with such
                  life-giving influence, on the dry and thirsty plain. The excessive brightness of
                  the foliage gradually waned, the thick leaves drooped, and hung languidly from the
                  branches, as if fainting for the salutary moisture of the skies, while the eye,
                  dazzled and wearied by the continuous sunshine, watched anxiously the faintest
                  shadow that floated over the glowing horizon, till every glance beamed prayer,
                  that the blessing of the rain and the dew might be borne within its bosom. Then
                  welcome was the forest depth, the shadow of the rock, in the sultry land. Leila
                  wandered through the solitudes she loved. From her childhood she had been
                  accustomed to solitary rambles, and her parents, with indulgent tenderness,
                  allowed no restraint to be imposed upon her inclinations, confiding in the purity
                  of their origin. Mid the loneliness of nature, she held deep and unwitnessed
                  intercourse with the mysteries of her own heart, but its language was inexplicable
                  to her simplicity. She could not define the vague, restless consciousness of guilt
                  which mingled with her secret devotions, weighed down its spirit in its upward
                  flight, and spread a dimness over all her dreams of heaven.</p>
               <p>She sat in the coolness of one of her favourite retreats, unconscious in the
                  shadows that surrounded her, of the heavy cloud that was rising, darkening and
                  rapidly diffusing itself over the sky, till a faint flash of lightning, quivering
                  through the gloom, succeeded by a low, sullen roar of distant thunder, warned her
                  that the prayer of the husbandman was about to be answered, and a painful feeling
                  of her personal apprehension accompanied the conviction, when she thought of her
                  lonely and unprotected situation. She suffered unconquerable terrors in a thunder
                  storm. It was one of those constitutional<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6687-00000187"
                  /> weaknesses which no mental energy could overcome. When a child, she believed
                  this awful herald of elemental wrath was the voice of the Ancient of Days,
                  proclaiming his omnipotent mandates to a hushed and trembling world; she
                  associated it with the mountain that burned with unconsuming flame, with all the
                  most terrible manifestations of Almighty power; and though, in after years, she
                  learned the sublime mysteries of nature, she never forgot the impressions of her
                  childhood. Almost powerless from dread, she endeavoured to find her homeward path,
                  while the storm approached with a rapidity and violence, which might have shaken
                  nerves less exquisitely sensitive than hers. The lightning no longer ran in
                  dazzling chains, on the edge of the sky, but spread in bannered pomp over the
                  firmament, and the thunder came on, in gathering peals, louder, deeper, nearer,
                  till the trees of the forest shook in their ancient brotherhood, and the coeval
                  rocks reverberated fearfully with the sound.</p>
               <p>Leila thought of the grove which was consecrated in her mind by the image of
                  Father Hilario, which even now might be hallowed by his presence, and though
                  bewildered by fear, she sought it as a <emph>city of shelter,</emph> to which she
                  might fly and live. She saw the thick vine wreaths, which hung in unpruned
                  luxuriance over one of the most lovely and sequestered arbours nature ever arched
                  in the wilderness, for the repose and security of man. She reached the entrance,
                  and glancing through the lattice-work, woven by the interlacing tendrils, was
                  arrested there by the object which met her gaze. The same figure, which, years
                  before, had beamed on her sight, like an angel of peace, now knelt in the centre
                  of the grotto, calm amidst the warring elements, absorbed in adoration and prayer,
                  while the lightning as it flashed through the foliage, played around his uplifted
                  brow, in wreaths of living glory. Leila trembled as she gazed—she dared not to
                  disturb his sublime confidence with her wild, undisciplined terrors; but, faint
                  with fatigue, dread, and a thousand undefined emotions, she leaned against the
                  branches, with a sigh, heavy, as irrespressible. Father Hilario heard that low
                  sound, though apparently insensible to the thunder's crash. No expression of human
                  suffering ever fell unheeded on <emph>his</emph> ear, and, turning to the
                  direction from whence it proceeded, he saw his beloved disciple, standing
                  exhausted and agitated before him—the deathlike paleness of fear triumphing on her
                  cheeks over the lilies of nature. With an involuntary impulse of tenderness and
                  compassion, he extended his arms towards her, and Leila sunk into their protecting
                  fold, with a feeling like that with which we may suppose the wounded dove seeks
                  the sheltering down of its mother's wings.</p>
               <p>Father Hilario endeavored, with the most persuasive gentleness, to infuse into her
                  mind the composure and confidence, arising from faith in that Being who makes the
                  mightiest elements his vassals, and whose mercy is commensurate to his power. He
                  recalled to her those many instances on holy record, where the faithful had been
                  preserved, and innocence left unharmed,<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6687-00000188"/>
                  while the most terrible ministers of God's vengeance were dealing out destruction
                  to the rebellious and polluted. While he was yet speaking, an electrifying flash
                  illuminated the grove—the thunder burst in one magnificent pæan over the forest,
                  and the tall tree, beneath whose boughs the grotto was woven, stood with its trunk
                  shivered and scathed, though its green summit seemed still unconscious of the
                  desolation that awaited it. The large rain-drops now plashed on the leaves, the
                  wind bowed and twisted the branches, as if anxious to open a passage for the
                  shower to the panting bosom of the earth. It came down in deluging torrents. Their
                  canopy of leaves no longer sheltered them, the vine was rent, the frail twigs
                  scattered on the blast, which every moment swept with increasing violence over
                  Father Hilario and his now almost helpless charge. He vainly endeavored to shield
                  her from its fury, by wrapping his arms around her and pressing her closer and
                  closer to a heart which, free from the tumults of earthly passion, might well
                  become the resting-place of innocence and beauty. Even in that hour of grandeur
                  and horror, when the death-bolts where every where hissing through the clouds,
                  Leila felt a glow of happiness pervading her being, which triumphed over the
                  effects of the chilling wind and drenching rain—yet no emotion agitated her
                  spotless breast, which an incarnate angel might not have felt, and gloried in
                  acknowledging. It seemed to her that while Omnipotence was bowing the heavens, and
                  coming down in all its glory and majesty, almost annihilating her very existence
                  with awe, she beheld in the mild, religious eyes, that were looking down into her
                  soul, a beam of heaven's own love and mercy, a blessed assurance that man is never
                  forgotten by the Almighty, and that the low prayer of faith rises with acceptance
                  to his ear, high above the din and wailing of the tempest.</p>
               <p>There was one eye which witnessed this scence—it was a <emph>solitary</emph>
                  one—and the worst passions of which our nature is capable, were concentrated in
                  its rays. Murillo had followed the steps of Leila. He marked the coming storm, and
                  hastened to her accustomed haunts, believing that she would willingly seek a
                  refuge from its violence, even in his sheltering arms. Not finding the object of
                  his search, he continued his pursuit in doubt and alarm, till he discovered the
                  place of her retreat, and saw, himself unseen, all which we have just described.
                  He remained rooted to the spot by a kind of fascination, which he had not the
                  power to dispel. The truth was revealed to him at once—she loved
                     him—<emph>she,</emph> this vestal beauty, who seemed surrounded by an
                  atmosphere of spheral, unapproachable light, she loved this heaven-dedicated
                  mortal with all the ardour of woman's first, unblighted affection. He read it in
                  every expression of her upturned eye, in the doubtful colour that momentarily dyed
                  her cheek, then left it stainless in its native whiteness. He felt maddened by
                  this discovery. He had always looked upon Guido, whom he had sworn to hate, as a
                  rival, and feared his success; but Father Hilario, a man whose age so much
                  transcended hers, whose profession excluded him from the world's sympathies<pb
                     n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6687-00000189"/> —it was incredible. He could not,
                  however, but acknowledge to himself, that if Father Hilario had passed the morning
                  of youth, time had not cast one shade over the meridian of his manhood, and while
                  he gazed upon him, as he knelt in the storm, thus tenderly supporting and
                  cherishing the only being who had ever kindled a sentiment of love in his own dark
                  bosom, he was forced to confess, that man never had a nobler representative.</p>
               <p>It is a bootless and unprofitable task, that of attempting to describe the
                  unfathomable hell of a human heart, delivered up to the unresisted mastery of its
                  own evil passions. It is on the <emph>consequences</emph> of crime that the
                  moralist rests his hope. These, called up by the wizard wand of conscience, glide
                  and glide before the eyes of the pale delinquent, like the accusing phantoms, in
                  the night vision of the guilty and aspiring Thane.</p>
               <p>The storm subsided—the heavy clouds rolled towards the eastern horizon, and the
                  covenant token of mercy arched its deepening radiance on the retiring vapours.
                  Father Hilario pointed out to Leila this glorious reflection of the Creator's
                  smile, and dwelt upon that memorable era, when it first bent in beauty over the
                  sinking waters of the deluge. Every object in their homeward path elicited from
                  him a lesson of gratitude and love. Leila listened, but not to the rich melodies
                  of nature, which were now breathing and gushing around them, in the music of
                  waters, the symphony of birds, and the mellow intonations of the distant thunder,
                  that rolled at intervals its organ-notes on the gale. She heard but one sound in
                  the magnificent chorus—the voice of Father Hilario.</p>
               <p>Had Murillo never stolen, like a serpent as he was, to that bower of shelter, and
                  witnessed emotions, whose purity, the baseness and corruption of his nature could
                  never conceive, and which he imagined partook of the unholy ardour of his own
                  feelings, her innocent heart would perhaps never have known the pangs of
                  self-upbraiding, which afterwards so cruelly martyred its peace. He watched his
                  opportunity of meeting her alone. The spell which had enthralled him in her
                  presence was now dissolved. He loved her still, but he no longer feared; for the
                  secret of which he was the master, placed her more upon a level with himself, and
                  brought her down from that high mount of holiness, upon which his imagination had
                  exalted her. He was resolved to humble her by accusing her to her face of the
                  sacrilege of which she was guilty.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Leila," cried he, stung by the cold, averted air with which she met his
                  proffered civilities, "I know it all. It is not that your heart is wedded to
                  heaven, that you turn from the gaities of youth, and scorn the vows of the young
                  and the brave. You love Father Hilario. You cannot, you dare not deny it. All that
                  you have inspired in me, false girl, you feel for him. I saw you, Leila, when you
                  thought no eye but his was on you, folded to his bosom, in the solitude of the
                  grove, the crimson of passion glowing on your cheek, and its lightnings, brilliant
                  as those<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6687-00000190"/> which illuminated the sky,
                  kindling in your eyes. In vain"—</p>
               <p>He paused, for he was terrified by the effect of his words; she stood as if
                  smitten by some avenging angel. Every drop of blood seemed to have deserted its
                  wonted channel, for it is scarcely exaggerated to say, that her face and lips were
                  white as marble, and they looked as deadly cold; while her eyes, which darkened in
                  their intensity, were riveted on his, with a look of wild supplication, which
                  would have melted a less indurated heart. The truth burst upon her like a
                  thunderbolt, and it crushed her to the earth. Had it been whispered her in the dim
                  shadows of night, by a mother's gentle voice, it would have come over her, even
                  then, with a blasting power, but to have it break upon her thus—the unfortunate
                  girl sank down upon the fragment of a rock, near the spot where they stood, and,
                  covering her face with her hands, wept in agony. Murillo's terror subsided at the
                  sight of her tears, and he went on remorsely widening the wound he had made.</p>
               <p>"Think not," he continued, "no longer to deceive the world. It shall know the
                  latent fire which burns beneath the ice of sanctity, with which thou hast
                  encircled thyself. Father Hilario, too! Vile wolf, who has clothed himself in
                  shepherd's garb!"—</p>
               <p>"Forbear!" almost shrieked Leila, at these words; "oh! never by thought, or word,
                  or look"—she stopped despairingly, she knew not in what language to vindicate the
                  character of Father Hilario from the charges of his adversary. She felt that she
                  was in his power, and casting herself on her knees before him, she supplicated for
                  mercy. "You may destroy me. Murillo, <emph>I</emph> merit it. I have deceived
                  myself and the world; <emph>I</emph> am guilty beyond forgiveness; but Father
                     Hilario—<emph>he</emph> lives only for the God who has anointed him. Oh! if
                  through me he should suffer"—her joined hands and beseeching eyes finished what
                  her bloodless lips in vain endeavoured to articulate. Murillo gazed with malignant
                  triumph upon his victim. He had wrapped his coil around her, and she might seek,
                  with unavailing struggles, to extricate herself from the folds. But whatever was
                  his purpose he chose to dissemble, and raising her, whom he had so deeply
                  humiliated, from the ground, he assured her that her secret should be safe in his
                  possession, and her feeling sacred in his eyes. He solicited her pardon for the
                  extravagancies to which love and jealousy had urged him, in terms so mild and
                  submissive, and begged to be admitted to her friendship and sympathy, with such
                  lowly deference, it is not strange that he deceived one so guileless and
                  confiding.</p>
               <p>He left her—left the dart to rankle where he threw it and—it <emph>did</emph>
                  rankle. Never more did she meet with an untroubled eye, the calm and heavenly
                  glance of Father Hilario. No longer did she sit at his feet with the sweet
                  docility of childhood, the deep joy of her soul mirrored on her brow. Father
                  Hilario was grieved at her estrangement; he feared that the flower he had so
                  carefully reared for Paradise was about to lavish its bloom and its fragrance on
                  the perishing things of this world; but when he gently reproved,<pb n="398-399"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000191"/> her for her coolness, she would only turn from him
                  silently and wept. Unhappy Leila! the fairest and purest of earth are oft devoted
                  to the saddest destiny; and what doom more sad than to be condemned to the
                  conviction that the inspirations of virtue and sensibility are sacrilege and
                  guilt?</p>
               <p>Father Hilario sat one evening, as he was wont to do, in a chamber which he had
                  consecrated to devotion, surrounded by the authors he loved, and the saints whom
                  he adored. Already the waning sun diffused that golden, religious light through
                  the apartment, which falls with such soothing, solemnizing influence on the soul
                  of the devotee. He sat in spiritual abstraction, an illuminated missal open before
                  him, and the holy emblem of his faith placed so as to receive the gilding of the
                  western rays. The sound of hasty footsteps, and the confused murmur of voices
                  approaching this hitherto unmolested retreat, roused him from his devout
                  meditations. The door was violently thrown open, and a party of citizens, whose
                  looks were indicative of horror and alarm, entered the apartment.</p>
               <p>"What means this tumult?" exclaimed Father Hilario; and he feared some calamitous
                  event had filled the village with consternation. The man who seemed to be the
                  leader of the group, advanced with an air of mingled authority and trepidation,
                  and laying his hand on the shoulder of Father Hilario, addressed him in the
                  startling words: "You are our prisoner, Father Hilario. We arrest you by order of
                  the chief magistrate."</p>
               <p>"Me! your minister?" exclaimed Father Hilario, in dignified yet sorrowful
                  amazement. "Of what am I accused?"</p>
               <p>"Of <emph>murder!</emph>" cried the officer, and the words were muttered by the
                  rest of the party, in tones that seemed to be afraid of their own echoes. Father
                  Hilario looked steadfastly on the faces of each to see if he were not surrounded
                  by a band of maniacs. With added solemnity he repeated the question, and received
                  the same awful reply. A dead silence succeeded this reiteration, when, gathering
                  himself up with indescribable majesty, he commanded them to depart. The
                  indignation of outraged manhood towered over the long-suffering meekness of
                  Christianity.</p>
               <p>"Ye know me!" he cried, and his usual mild voice was fearful in its power. "Ye
                  know that I am not a man of blood. I have toiled, wept, and prayed for your
                  salvation. The delegate of my divine Master, I have broken for you, with
                  unpolluted hands, the bread of life. I have followed your paths in sickness and
                  sorrow, binding up the wounds of human suffering, lifting the bruised reed, and
                  holding the lamp of faith over the valley of death. I have—but oh! perverse
                  generation, is this your return?" He stopped, over-powered by the depth of his
                  emotion, while tears, which only agony could have drawn forth, gushed from his
                  eyes. The men looked at each other as if in shame and fear, for the errand they
                  had undertaken. The officer said, "it is a most painful task, which had devolved
                  upon him, but that duty was imperative, and must be obeyed." "Who is my accuser<pb
                     n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6687-00000192"/> ser?" demanded the victim. "I,"
                  answered a deep voice from behind, and Murillo advanced in front of the group. His
                  face was cold and calm, and his manner firm and self-possessed. He spoke as a man
                  conscious of the import of his words, and ready to meet their consequences. "I
                  accuse thee of the murder of Guido. <emph>I</emph> saw the deed. <emph>I</emph>
                  saw the dagger in his bloody breast. Cold on the earth he lies. I accuse thee, in
                  the face of God and of man, as the perpetrator of the crime." While Murillo was
                  speaking, Father Hilario resumed his composure, though a deeper shade of solemnity
                  settled on his brow. "Search," cried he, "for the proofs of your accusation. Every
                  recess is open to your scrutiny."</p>
               <p>He unfolded the doors to their examination; but what words can speak the
                  consternation of Father Hilario, when, as they passed into the ante-chamber, they
                  lifted his surplice, which he had left there as was his custom when he retired to
                  the inner apartment, and found it all dabbled with blood; even the print of gory
                  fingers, <emph>damning proof</emph> of the recent death-struggle, was visible on
                  its ample folds. A dagger, too, clotted with fresh blood gouts, fell to the floor,
                  as the officer of justice displayed the ensanguined raiment, and there it lay "in
                  form and shape as palpable" as the air drawn dagger, which gleamed before the eyes
                  of the Scottish regicide. Father Hilario staggered back against the wall, his ashy
                  lips quivering with unutterable horror, his hair actually recoiling from his brow,
                  as if instinct with the spirit within. It was a scene which an Angelo would have
                  trembled with ecstasy to behold—and which he would have fixed upon his canvas in
                  imperishable colours. There was a look of ghastly excitement on every face, save
                     <emph>one,</emph> such as is seen at the midnight conflagration, when the
                  pallidness of terror is lighted up with an unearthly glare, by the flaming element
                  around. That face was still and cold in its expression—if there was one feeling
                  predominant over another, it seemed to be scorn, and a slight curl of the lip,
                  turned towards Father Hilario, said, as plain as words could utter it, "thou
                  hypocrite!" Father Hilario marked it not. <emph>His</emph> eyes were directed
                  towards heaven—<emph>his</emph> hands folded on his breast, and those present
                  never forgot the manner in which he ejaculated the most affecting appeal on holy
                  record—"Oh! my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>
               <p>I have undertaken the task, and, however painful, I must not shrink from its
                  fulfilment; then let not the moralist upbraid me, for introducing an event which
                  the infidel might exultingly cite, as proof that no superintending Providence
                  watched over the destinies of man. But, who are those who stand around the throne
                  of God, clothed with robes of glory, and immortal crowns upon their brows? They
                  who have travelled with bleeding feet through the briers and thorns of human
                  suffering, mid darkness, and tribulation, and despair—the pilgrims of sorrow, that
                  they may be the inheritors of immortality. Father Hilario had walked
                  uncontaminated through a path where the flowers of love and the incense of
                  adulation were dangerously blended; he was now to pass through the<pb n="402-403"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000193"/> refiner's fire, that the fine gold might be
                  purified from the dross of this world's pollution. I will not linger on scenes so
                  revolting. He surrendered himself into the hands of the magistrate, and in one of
                  those cells vaulted for the reception of human guilt, one of the best and purest
                  of God's creation, awaited the trial for life or death. The inhabitants of the
                  village trembled and clustered together, as when the shock of an earthquake is
                  felt, claiming closer brotherhood in the general calamity. They loudly proclaimed
                  his innocence; they protested against his arrest as an act of sacrilege; they
                  would have burst his prison doors to redeem him, but he would not permit the laws
                  of his country to be violated. He exhorted them to forbearance, and prayed them to
                  leave the event in the hands of the Almighty. I dare not speak of what Leila
                  suffered. From the moment she heard the awful tidings, she sat speechless as a
                  statue; the look of wild consternation, with which she first listened, imprinted
                  on her face, as if it had been chiselled in the marble she resembled. Could she
                  but have wept!—but hers was not common woe—even maternal tenderness could not
                  fathom its depth. Tears!—horror had frozen their fountain.</p>
               <p>The day of trial came; a day never forgotten in the annals of the village of L——.
                  The hall of justice was filled almost to suffocation. Every countenance was
                  flushed with that expression of high-wrought excitement, which extraordinary and
                  awful events are calculated to produce; and it is a strange, inexplicable paradox
                  of the human heart, that, however appalling palling may be those events, there is
                  something of <emph>pleasure</emph> in the intensity of feeling they call forth.
                  When Father Hilario appeared, there was a murmur through the crowd, like the
                  hushing of autumnal winds, succeeded by the stillness of awe and expectation. His
                  cheek was wan, his eye solemn, yet serene, and his hair hung neglected on his
                  temples, as if heavy with the dungeon's dampness. There was a heaving of the
                  crowd, as he passed through, intimating the restless elements restrained in its
                  bosom. Father Hilario—the revered, the beloved—the almost worshipped—stood
                  arraigned before the bar of his country, accused of the blood of his fellow man.
                  Where was his accuser? There—conspicuous amidst the throng, towered the stately
                  form of Murillo. Men looked upon him askance, unwilling to fix a steady gaze on
                  him, who had armed the avenging laws against one whom, in spite of the
                  blood-stained robe and dagger, they <emph>felt</emph> must be innocent. Murillo
                  knew the part before him, and he was eloquent. His voice, when he chose to
                  modulate it, had something peculiarly insinuating in its tones. He began so low,
                  that the people were obliged to bend forward earnestly to hear his articulation.
                  These low sounds, however, were only the prelude to a burst of impassioned
                  eloquence. He described the scene which he had witnessed—the wild shriek, which,
                  piercing the air, startled him in his evening walk; the form of Guido sinking
                  beneath the death steel of the anointed assassin. He painted, with graphic power,
                  the flight of Father Hilario; the concealing of the dagger in his bosom, the
                     gathering<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6687-00000194"/> up of his robe to hide the
                  bloody stains; every thing was minutely marked. The voiceless witnesses, that robe
                  and dagger, were produced and appealed to, almost as powerfully as the dumb wounds
                  of Cæsar, by the artful and eloquent Antony. He next enlarged upon the motives of
                  the deed. With the subtlety of a fiend, he stole into the ears of his auditors,
                  throwing out dark hints of the resistless influence of jealousy, sweeping down the
                  landmarks of reason, honour, and religion. Father Hilario knew that Guido was his
                  rival. Then, seeing his audience start, as if electrified at the disclosure, he
                  pursued his advantage, and painted the scene in the arbour, during the awful
                  warfare of nature. He saw a flush of indescribable emotion in Father Hilario's
                  face, and it redoubled his energy. He even disclosed, though with apparent grief
                  and reluctance, the despair and remorse with which the ill-fated girl had
                  confessed her sacrilegious passion. He closed with an adjuration to religion and
                  humanity, to vindicate their violated laws, by hurling a bolt "red with uncommon
                  wrath," on the vile impostor, who had clothed himself in white and fleecy robes,
                  to despoil innocence of its bloom, and manhood of the free gift of life.</p>
               <p>A death-like silence prevailed after the accuser had ceased to speak, first broken
                  by a deep, convulsive sob. The mourner sat in a remote corner of the hall, and his
                  face was bowed on his joined hands. It was the father of Leila, who had heard all
                  that had been uttered of his child, without the power to refute the daring charge.
                  The painful situation to which the unhappy girl was reduced, was a dreadful
                  commentary upon the words of Murillo. With all the anguish of a father, he felt
                  that she was lost to him, and the cause of her fading and despair burst upon him
                  at once, with horrible reality. The father's sobs pleaded more powerfully against
                  Father Hilario than the laboured eloquence of Murillo.</p>
               <p>At last Father Hilario rose, and so great was the excitement of the audience, that
                  almost all who were present rose simultaneously. His manner had lost much of its
                  serene composure, his countenance was agitated, and a flush of hectic brightness
                  burned on his pallid cheek. He had resigned himself to his own fate, but now the
                  destiny of another was identified with his. He felt that his lonely arm might
                  vainly endeavour to interpose a barrier between them and the gathered storm.</p>
               <p>"I have naught," said he, "to offer against the black charges alleged against me,
                  but the evidence of a stainless life; a life whose best and holiest energies have
                  been exerted in your behalf. I am innocent—God knows I am innocent—but the powers
                  of darkness are leagued for my destruction, and I am left alone to wrestle with
                  their wrath. I will not plead for myself, but in behalf of insulted purity, I will
                  lift up my voice, till it meet an answer in the skies. I speak of that innocent
                  being, whom I sheltered in these paternal arms, from the fury of the desolating
                  tempest. I knew not that any eye, save the all-seeing one, beheld the meeting, but
                  never has one thought warmed<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6687-00000195"/> my breast
                  for her, that angels might not sanction, and omniscient holiness approve. I have
                  loved her as a young disciple of our common Lord, as a most precious lamb of the
                  flock of Israel, whom my pastoral hand has led through the green fields, and by
                  the deep waters of eternal life. She needs no vindication; ye know that she is
                  pure. Oh! could the unfortunate youth, whose life blood dyes yon sacerdotal robe,
                  now rend the cerements of his voiceless grave, enter this crowded hall, and point
                  his mouldering finger at the undetected murderer—the bold accuser of unarmoured
                  innocence would call upon the mountains and the rocks to cover him from the
                  justice of man, and the vengeance of God. But, though no mortal power can bring
                  him before this earthly bar, there <emph>is</emph> a tribunal, impartial and
                  eternal, where he now pleads, where he will forever plead, against the guilty
                  wretch, who has dared to break the most awful canons of the living God. Oh! ye
                  deluded people!" continued he, extending his apostolic hands towards them; "I weep
                  not for myself, but for you. I yearn not for life. I had hoped to have breathed
                  out my soul on the natural pillow of decay, soothed by the voice of tenderness,
                  and hallowed by the tears of regret; but to go down to an ignominious grave, and
                  leave a dark, dishonoured memory!—yet it is meet that I suffer. The Almighty wills
                  that I should, or he might rend the heavens for my deliverance, and send down
                  armies of angels to shield me from your rage. I should rather glory in my
                  martyrdom, as the disciple of Him, in whose name I have lived, in whose faith I
                  will triumphantly die, who wore the crown of agony, and bore the cross of shame.
                  For you, if my condemnation <emph>is</emph> sealed, the time will come when the
                  days will roll in sorrow and gloom over your heads, the nights will come on in the
                     <emph>blackness of darkness,</emph> ye will seek for comfort and ye will not
                  find it, for the weight of innocent blood will be on your souls."</p>
               <p>There was a sudden parting in the crowd—those who were clustered round the gate
                  fell back, as if by irresistible impulse, and an apparition glided through the
                  dividing throng, which might well be taken as a messenger from another world.
                  Pale, white as a death-shroud, her neglected locks floating around her, wild as
                  the tendrils of the forest vine, and her eyes beaming with intense and wandering
                  fires, she rushed forward, regardless of every object, save one, and threw her
                  arms around Father Hilario, with a cry of such piercing anguish, as thrilled
                  through every nerve of her auditors. Need I say, that it was the unfortunate
                  Leila, who, roused from the lethargy of despair, and supported by the unnatural
                  strength of madness, had thus forced her desperate way in the hope of dying with
                  him she loved? As Father Hilario looked upon this sweet, blighted flower of his
                  fondest earthly affections, lying in drooping, dying loveliness on his bosom, he
                  forgot everything but her tenderness and devotion, and closing his arms around
                  her, "tears such as angels shed" baptized her spotless face. In vain did her
                  father, with a breaking heart, strive to release her from the<pb n="408-409"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000196"/> embrace she had sought. She clung to Father Hilario
                  with an energy that seemed supernatural, a clasp that was almost indissoluble,
                  till, at length, exhausted and apparently expiring, she relaxed her hold, and was
                  borne by her father to his now desolate home. Father Hilario gazed after her till
                  the last glimpse of her figure was lost, then covering his face with his hands,
                  his Creator only saw and knew the passing agony of that moment.</p>
               <p>The sequel of this trial must have been anticipated, from some dark intimations of
                  his fate, at the commencement of the narrative. The unconscious Leila had sealed,
                  by her presence, the doom of him she would have died to save. Her desperation and
                  love were fatal corroborations of the truth of Murillo's testimony. Father Hilario
                  returned to his cell, a condemned man; condemned to expiate at the
                     <emph>stake,</emph> the double crime of sacrilege and murder; but it is
                  recorded that the judges, who were men of stern, unbending character, wept as they
                  uttered the sentence, and the people sobbed and groaned audibly as they heard it.
                  * * * * * *</p>
               <p>At length the day dawned which was marked for the consummation of the dreadful
                  decree. It was one of painful, sickening brightness. Nature had clothed herself in
                  her most magnificent robes, and assumed her fairest smile, as if to mock the
                  crimes and sufferings of man. On a gradual eminence, covered with living green,
                  o'ercanopied with dazzling sapphire, was seen the funeral pile of the victim. A
                  multitude was stretched widely, darkly around it, and heaving ing heavily,
                  mournfully on the air, the death-bell rolled its long, deep echoing knell, saddest
                  of all earthly sounds. There was something awful in the stillness of this vast
                  multitude—even more than its wild rush and commotion, when Father Hilario was led
                  forth to the fatal pile. He passed along, clad in white victim robes, the crucifix
                  suspended on his bosom, his face placid as the lake, on which the moonbeams
                  untrembling repose. Every trace of human emotion had vanished. He had been on the
                  mount of prayer, and the reflection of the invisible glory was still bright on his
                  brow. If ever mortal, in the expresson of saint-like humanity, patience, mildness
                  and majesty, approached the similitude of the divine sufferer, it was Father
                  Hilario. He passed along to the sound of the mournful bell, through the audible
                  lamentations of the crowd, where man in his strength, woman in her sensibility,
                  and childhood in its helplessness and timidity, were strangely and inexplicably
                  blended. The victim reached the place of sacrifice. He turned around, to take in,
                  for the last time, the glories of creation; then bending his eyes on the
                  multitude, he extended his arms, in benediction over them. He spoke, and that
                  voice, so sweet and solemn, rose through the deepening murmurs, like the diapason
                  of an organ, mid the wailings of a storm.</p>
               <p>"Ye beloved flock, farewell! To that Almighty Shepherd, who laid down his life for
                  your salvation, with prayers and blessings, I commit you. Again I say, weep not
                  for me. Rejoice rather, that ye see me die an innocent, a triumphant martyr.
                  Think, when<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6687-00000197"/> the fiery wrath encircles
                  my brow, how soon it will be converted into a crown of glory. Even now me-thinks I
                  see through the opening heavens, the wheels of the descending cherubim."—He looked
                  up, as he spoke, with a countenance of inspiration, and kneeling down exclaimed,
                  with the adoring prophet, "My Father, my Father! the chariot of Israel and the
                  horsemen thereof." The awe-struck crowd gazed up into the unshadowed vault, almost
                  believing to witness the same miracle of divine love, wrought in behalf of the
                  sainted victim. But they beheld no burning car rolling through the arch of
                  heaven—no wings of angels parted its resplendent blue. They looked down to earth,
                  and saw Father Hilario embracing the fatal stake. One flash of the kindling pyre,
                  and a wild, simultaneous shriek rent the air. Higher and hgher rose the gathering
                  blaze; still, through the winding sheet of flame, glimpses were seen of that
                  glorious form, crowned with the awful pomp of martyrdom. Deeper and deeper closed
                  the fiery folds, then paler waxed the wasting splendour, till at last naught but
                  the smoke of the holocaust went up to heaven.</p>
               <p>Twice the sun rose and set over the scene of sacrifice. The silence of death
                  brooded over the valley. Again the bell swelled in funeral harmony on the
                  melancholy air, while a long procession darkened the church-yard and closed around
                  a solitary grave. At the head of that grave appeared the figure of a griefstricken
                  man. There was such an expression of unspeakable woe and humiliation in his
                  countenance, that even sympathy turned away, self-rebuked, for having looked at
                  sorrow too sacred for observation. It was the broken-hearted father of Leila. It
                  was around <emph>her</emph> grave that mournful throng was gathering. But why were
                  no white-robed maidens there, to perform the customary rite, and scatter the
                  perishing wreath, emblem of fragility and beauty, over one who was the fairest of
                  their band? A dark spot had been discovered in the whiteness of the lily's
                  chalice, and the flowers of its tribe were not permitted to shed their mourning
                  sweetness over its decay. The appalling stillness which precedes the sound most
                  agonizing to the mourner's ear, the fall of the covering mould, pervaded the
                  scene. The father lay prostrate on the earth, and the throes which shook his
                  frame, were fearful to behold. Some thought, as they gazed on his convulsive
                  pangs, there could be no grief like <emph>his;</emph> but they remembered her who
                  was left in the forsaken home. The mother's sorrow was not for man to witness.
                  When, at length, that damp, heavy, doleful sound, the last knell of mortality,
                  fell startlingly on the ear, Murillo, who had stood in statue-like immobility,
                  somewhat aloof from the general throng, rushed wildly forward, and stepping on the
                  very brink of the grave, exclaimed, in a voice which might rend the marble
                  slumbers of death:</p>
               <p>"Away!—she shall not go down unhonoured and unavenged. She's mine—I bought
                  her—with my soul's price I bought her—the covenant is written in blood, and sealed
                  with the flames of martyrdom. Yes," he continued, his fiery eyes flashing with
                     intolerable<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6687-00000198"/> lerable brightness;
                  "yes! ye blind judges, tremble, for ye have need. Ye have condemned an angel of
                  light upon the testimony of a fiend. Ye have done that, which ye would give worlds
                  upon worlds to redeem. Behold in <emph>me</emph> the assassin of Guido, the
                  murderer of Father Hilario, the destroyer of Leila. I execrated Guido, for he made
                  me a branded Cain among my fellow men. I hated Father Hilario, for Leila
                     <emph>loved</emph> him; and <emph>I,</emph> an alien from mankind, lived but to
                  worship <emph>her.</emph> She loved him, but with a love as pure as that which
                  warms the burning cherubim—I stole the robes of holiness, and wrought beneath
                  their folds the deed of hell. The Prince of darkness was with me, and promised me
                  her, who now lies cold in the bed my gory hands have made. Here, in the presence
                  of death, and the prospect of judgment, in the name of that dreadful Deity I have
                  defied, I proclaim the innocence of my victims, your own guilt and mine. Live on,
                  if ye will, weighed down with the curse of guiltless blood upon your souls; for
                  me, I <emph>lived</emph> to destroy—I <emph>die</emph> to avenge." Before an arm
                  could be lifted to avert the deed, he had drawn a dagger from his vest, and
                  plunging it in his bosom, fell a bleeding, but unavailing sacrifice to the ashes
                  of Leila.</p>

               <p>"I DON'T believe brother will be here to-night—that I don't," said little Mary
                  Norwood, rubbing her eyes that winked and ached from gazing so long from the
                  window. "I won't love him if he don't; such a pretty bright night too."</p>
               <p>"You had better go to bed, my child," said Mrs. Norwood, smoothing down her
                  wayward ringlets, "you are getting very sleepy, and Augustus will not be here a
                  minute sooner from your watching."</p>
               <p>"No, but I want to see my doll he's going to bring me, and besides I am not a bit
                  sleepy, mother,"—and she opened her round blue eyes to their widest limits, to
                  prove the truth of her assertion.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe Augustus would know Mary if he saw her any where else," said
                  Harriet Norwood, looking lovingly on her little sister, "she has grown so much,
                  and altered too, within the last two years."</p>
               <p>"He would know those big blue eyes of hers any where," answered her mother,
                  smiling, "especially when she puts on that round look, as he used to call it. I
                  hope <emph>he</emph> will not be changed, but bring back the same sunny
                  countenance and ingenuous smile, that distinguished his face from a thousand. He
                     <emph>will,</emph> if he has preserved the sunshine of his heart undimmed, and
                  its fountains pure from corruption. There are so many temptations in a large city,
                  I have sometimes trembled for him, considering his youth,<pb n="414-415"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000199"/> and the proneness of the human heart to wander from
                  the strait and narrow path into the wide road that leads to ruin."</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother," said Harriet warmly, "I know he is the same. Such an affectionate
                  disposition and ardent feelings as his, united with such upright principles and
                  such high sense of honour, could never change so soon. I would scarcely be afraid
                  to stake my life on his uncorrupted integrity."</p>
               <p>"Rose Somers herself could not have defended him with more warmth," replied Mrs.
                  Norwood, smiling at Harriet's glowing cheek and earnest countenance, "but you
                  little know a mother's heart if you think there is not as eloquent an advocate in
                  his behalf pleading in my breast as yours."</p>
               <p>"Hark!" exclaimed little Mary, jumping up eagerly and running again to the window,
                  "I hear bells—how sweet they jingle!—it's brother, I know."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Norwood and Harriet followed the rapid footsteps of Mary, and gazed abroad on
                  the pure expanse of snow, that, scarcely yet tracked by the footsteps of man,
                  shone white and dazzling in the moonlight. A light sheet had fallen during the
                  latter part of the day, and the sun, to Mary's bitter grief, had gone down in
                  clouds; but after awhile the moon was seen palely struggling through them, then
                  lining and edging them with brightening silver, till at length they melted in her
                  deepening radiance, and she looked down, unveiled and glorious, on one of the most
                  beautiful scenes of the universe—a wide landscape covered with smooth, undrifted
                  snow, that reflected its white lustre back through the cold still air—and looked
                  so sweet and pure, one might forget in gazing that sin or sorrow had ever marred
                  so fair a world. Mary's quick ear had not deceived her—the merry jingling of bells
                  was distinctly heard; they rung faster and faster, nearer and nearer—a sleigh
                  covered with sweeping buffalo skins came dashing up to the door, a young man
                  sprang out, and was welcomed at the threshold by a three-fold embrace, and smiles
                  and tears mingled together like an April shower, and still those clasping arms
                  were around him when he stood by the blazing hearth, whose ruddy light contrasted
                  beautifully with the cold splendour abroad.</p>
               <p>"How well you look, Augustus!" said his mother, as soon as she could speak, for
                  deep joy is never loquacious.</p>
               <p>"And you too, dear mother; you never looked so young; and what shall I say of
                  little Mary here, whom I left no higher than my knee?"</p>
               <p>"Ain't I grown tall, brother?" cried she, standing on tip-toe, and trying to
                  stretch out her little short, fat neck.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he, laughing, and lifting her in his arms as he spoke, "and those
                  round blue eyes have the same particular look of astonishment I always loved to
                  excite."</p>
               <p>He pressed her warm, rosy cheek against his cold one, while his mother warmed his
                  chilled hands in hers, and Harriet took off his frosty cloak, and drew his chair
                  close to the glowing fire.</p>
               <p>"There is indeed no place like home," exclaimed<pb n="416-417"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000200"/> he, looking round him with a glistening eye. "A
                  welcome like this would repay one for a long life's exile. I feel as if I were a
                  boy once more, I might almost say a girl, for a girl's softness is stealing over
                  my heart."</p>
               <p>He bent his head over Mary's flaxen ringlets, and she thought the snow flakes that
                  powdered his hair were melting in drops on her cheeks. She took this favourable
                  opportunity of whispering in his ear some very particular questions about the
                  dolls of the city, which received the best practical answer in the world in the
                  appearance of a waxen doll half as large as herself, which could open and shut its
                  eyes, and which put her into such an ecstasy of joy and admiration it is doubtful
                  whether she slept during the whole night. His mother and Harriet, too, had each
                  their respective gifts, testimonies of affection, whose value can only be known
                  and prized by those who have felt the warmth of such a <emph>welcome home.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Haven't you brought something pretty for Rose, too?" said Mary. "Don't you want
                  to see Rose Somers?"</p>
               <p>"And how is Rose Somers?" asked he, endeavouring to speak in a tone of unconcern.
                  "Has she forgotten her old schoolmate and friend?"</p>
               <p>"I am afraid she <emph>is</emph> forgetting you," answered little Mary, looking
                  thoughtfully down, "for when I asked her the other day if she did not want to see
                  you more than any body in the whole world, she said if she were a little girl like
                  me perhaps she would. She did not look glad either, for I saw the tears coming
                  into her eyes when she said it."</p>
               <p>Harriet smiled, but Augustus seemed infected by Mary's sadness, and remained
                  silent for some time, gazing steadfastly on the blazing hearth. It was then his
                  mother had leisure to observe his countenance, now in repose, and to note the
                  changes two years had wrought. He was much thinner, and she thought paler too,
                  though the fitful glow of the fire made it difficult to judge of the natural hue
                  of his complexion. There was a contraction of the brow, and an indescribable
                  expression about the mouth, caused by a slight quivering of the under lip, and the
                  compression of the upper. This expression was the more remarkable in him, as his
                  face had ever been distinguished by its joyous frankness and vivacity. He looked
                  up, and meeting his mother's mild and earnest gaze, seemed conscious that she was
                  reading a tablet of unutterable thoughts, for he roused himself from the
                  abstraction in which he had fallen, and talked and smiled as he was wont to do in
                  his more boyish days. Before the hour for retiring came, Mrs. Norwood drew a small
                  table near the fire, on which the family Bible was laid. Harriet placed a lamp at
                  its side, and little Mary slid down from her brother's knees, and took a low
                  chair, as if accustomed to a more reverential attitude when listening to the word
                  of God.</p>
               <p>"My dear Augustus," said Mrs. Norwood, in a tremulous voice, "this is the hour
                  when we have always most tenderly and feelingly remembered you.<pb n="418-419"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000201"/> We have never surrounded the family altar without
                  invoking blessings on your head, and praying that you might be shielded from
                  temptation and sorrow. If you still retain your love for this precious Book, and
                  this hallowed hour, I shall feel that my prayers have been answered."</p>
               <p>Augustus did not answer, but he opened the book, slowly turned over the leaves,
                  pausing and then going on as if irresolute where to select a portion of its
                  contents. The colour on his face heightened, till his very brow became
                  crimson.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me to-night, dear mother," said he hastily. "I am hoarse and weary from
                  riding so long in the cold. Besides I am occupying a place that yourself or
                  Harriet can far better fill."</p>
               <p>He rose as he spoke and took the seat farthest from the light, avoiding the
                  anxious glances that followed his footsteps, while Harriet, occupying the one he
                  had vacated, began to read. At first her voice faltered, but gathering firmness as
                  she proceeded, settled into a sweet solemnity of tone, appropriate to the holy
                  truths she uttered. But when the book was closed and they knelt down in prayer, it
                  was the mother's low accents that met the ear. When death had entered that
                  domestic circle and smitten the master of the household, who like the patriarchs
                  of ancient days had offered up the morning and evening sacrifice, Mrs. Norwood had
                  gathered her orphan children around her, and in the deep humility of a stricken
                  and wounded spirit, laid her lonely offerings on the shrine consecrated by the
                  manly devotions of years. She was not ashamed to lift up her voice, as well as her
                  heart, to Him who is the widow's God and the Father of the fatherless—and her
                  children thus educated in the hallowed atmosphere of prayer and of praise, learnt
                  to realize the omnipresence of their Creator, and to feel that there was an eye
                  that never slumbered or slept, constantly looking at their naked hearts. Several
                  of her younger children had died, and their mother yielding them up in faith to
                  their Redeemer, still bowed her head in prayer, and said, "Father, not my will but
                  thine be done." Little Mary, who was born since her father's death, was the
                  darling of the household. Like a flower blooming in the church-yard, she shed
                  brightness and fragrance over the home then made desolate by grief. And now when
                  happiness and cheerfulness once more gladdened the domestic scene, she, in her
                  sweet and joyous childhood, was the nucleus round which the tenderest cares and
                  fondest affections gathered. Young as she was, her heart even whispered its
                  response to her mother's aspirations and petitions, and she was as much afraid to
                  think an evil thought as to do an evil action. But let us leave Mary to develope
                  her guileless character, as she is called into action, and follow Augustus to his
                  chamber, where he is left alone with his own soul. He looked round on the
                  well-remembered walls—the pure white curtains, the neat, simple furniture,—the
                  shelves filled with well-selected books, till every object seemed to turn into an
                  accusing spirit, and upbraid him for his moral dereliction. And there was the
                  hallowed spot, where<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC6687-00000202"/> he had been
                  accustomed to kneel in prayer, and his guardian angel was wont to descend to bear
                  up the soul's incense to heaven, after having shed from his wings the blessings
                  with which they were laden. As he pressed his cheek on that spotless pillow, he
                  thought of the visions of his boyhood and early youth, and the sweet image of Rose
                  Somers glided before him so distinctly, she seemed to move between him and the
                  pale moonlight, like a soft and rosy cloud. Affections that had faded away in the
                  polluted atmosphere to which he had been exposed, now rose fresh and redolent as
                  in life's younger spring. And hand in hand with them came virtuous resolutions to
                  aid and sustain them. The past seemed a dream, a dark and troubled one, but its
                  very darkness served to exalt by the strength of contrast the brightness of the
                  future. He had been a slave, the more dishonoured because a willing one, but now
                  he was determined to burst his bonds, and rejoice in the liberty he had so
                  shamefully surrendered. He rose in the morning, in the full vigour of these
                  upright resolutions, but they were made in the confidence of his own strength, and
                  he was yet to prove the instability and weakness of human will, opposed to the
                  power of temptations and habit.</p>
               <p>Harriet's geraniums and green-house plants were placed in every window,
                  beautifully relieving the chill white back-ground on which they were displayed. He
                  saw they were arranged with a view to his particular gratification, and he did not
                  suffer a tint to pass unnoticed and unpraised. Mary brought him her kitten, a
                  beautiful creature, with a body as white as the snow, and a buff and grey tail,
                  which she run round and round after with a peculiar grace. This was duly admired
                  and petted for Mary's sake, who looked upon it with feelings verging towards
                  idolatry.</p>
               <p>"Augustus <emph>is</emph> unchanged," said Harriet, when her brother had left the
                  apartment; "he has preserved his love for nature pure and undiminished. He was
                  weary last night, but this morning he is himself again—only more manly—yet he has
                  not lost his boyish simplicity."</p>
               <p>"'Gustus isn't changed, no indeed," said Mary, caressing her favourite; "he let my
                  kitten climb his shoulder, to purr there as long as she pleased; you told me,
                  Harriet, he wouldn't care for kittens any more, but he does, and I love him all
                  the better for it, I know."</p>
               <p>"Augustus is changed in looks, but not in heart," said Rose Somers to herself, as
                  she sat at their fireside the evening after his return. "He is paler, and somewhat
                  graver too, but he is handsome, withal—and what he has lost in gaiety, he has
                  gained in sensibility of expression. I wonder if he thinks me changed?" continued
                  she, lowering her eyes before his vivid glance, "he reads me very closely."</p>
               <p>Rose, at seventeen, was not the same as Rose at fifteen, and yet the alteration
                  was more in manner than external appearance. She was not beautiful or handsome,
                  yet there was something about her perfectly bewitching, and this charm did not
                  consist in<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6687-00000203"/> any graces or smiles, or in
                  any thing that could be defined. It was felt by all who saw her, and yet few could
                  describe the attraction that pervaded her countenance and hung upon her
                  movements.</p>
               <p>"I cannot for my life take my eyes off that girl," said an honest farmer; "she
                  makes me think of every body I ever saw before, and yet looks like nobody in the
                  world but herself."</p>
               <p>Before Augustus had left the village, Rose was almost a fixture in her mother's
                  household. Of about the same age as Harriet, she was her almost inseparable
                  companion, and the avowed champion of Augustus in all his difficulties and trials.
                  She was the sharer, too, of his merry sports—whether coasting on the snowy
                  hill-side, or sliding over the ice in the bright moonlight, or rambling the green
                  fields in search of summer flowers. But now this familiarity would never do—they
                  must be polite and formal to each other, and Rose did try very hard to call him
                  Mr. Norwood, and to put on a show of womanly reserve, but after a few days she
                  forgot to call him Mr., and to take a seat far from his side. Familiar scenes were
                  renewed, the dear socialities of the winter fireside, the ride in the moonlight,
                  to the sound of the merry going bells, even the coasting down hill, and the
                  sliding on the ice, to the ecstasy of little Mary, who, taking hold of her
                  brother's coat as he skated, thought herself quite an experienced traveller on
                  ice. Mrs. Norwood, when she saw her son the enlivener of their domestic hearth, as
                  he was wont to be, reading for their amusement some work of genius and feeling,
                  while they were plying their busy needles, and winding up the evening with a
                  portion of God's holy word, felt happy once more, and with the all-hoping,
                  all-believing love of a mother, gave herself up to the conviction that all was
                  right. True, she would have felt very glad to have seen him established in
                  business, but then it was natural after two years' confinement and hard study,
                  that he would wish a little relaxation, and though not possessed of an ample
                  fortune, he was assured of an independence.</p>
               <p>Harriet and Rose sat together one night at a later hour than usual, by the
                  fireside. Mrs. Norwood and Mary had retired to bed, and they remained to watch for
                  the return of Augustus, who had gone out with a party of young men on a moonlight
                  expedition on the water. The streams had broken their ice-chains, so that boats
                  could glide on their surface, though the ground was still covered with snow. The
                  young men for several nights had been engaged in the amusement of fishing, and
                  Augustus was induced to join them.</p>
               <p>"I wish Augustus had not gone," said Harriet, as hour after hour waned away and he
                  did not return. "I do not like this going on the water at night; and there are
                  some very wild young men of the party."</p>
               <p>Rose looked at the clock, then at the window, then walking towards it, looked out
                  upon the street till her eyes were blinded with the intensity of their gaze. "It
                  is very strange," said she, "very strange, indeed. He said he would be back at
                  nine, and now<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6687-00000204"/> it is almost twelve.
                  Something must have happened. He never staid out so late before."</p>
               <p>"There was a young man drowned last winter in the river, in just such a frolic as
                  this," cried Harriet, her fears gathering strength from the manifest alarm of
                  Rose. "I wonder I could have forgotten it."</p>
               <p>"Harriet," exclaimed Rose, taking up her cloak and gathering it around her, "I am
                  not afraid of going out such a night as this. It is as light as day. It is not
                  more than a quarter of a mile to the river the back way. Let us go and see if we
                  can discover any traces of them."</p>
               <p>Harriet had some scruples about the propriety of the step, notwithstanding her
                  anxiety about her brother; but Rose, in her impetuosity, bore them down, and in a
                  few moments they were running along the foot-path that led through the fields, so
                  closely muffled in their dark cloaks and hoods, that Augustus himself could not
                  have recognized them. Every thing around them was as still as if all nature were
                  sleeping in the cold moonlight. They heard nothing but the beating of their own
                  hearts, as they glided swiftly on, till they reached the bank of the stream. There
                  was a slight declivity where they stood, and the water rushed and gurgled over the
                  pebbles, and looked so dark and fearful where the moonbeams did not fall, that
                  their imaginations, already excited, invested the scene with something wild,
                  gloomy, and peculiar. Unwilling to express to each other the extent of their
                  fears, afraid of the sound of their own voices in that deep stillness, they
                  remained silent and trembling, looking up and down the stream, and listening to
                  the faintest sound, till a thousand echoes seemed ringing in their ears. At length
                  they saw a light glimmering on the stream—it came nearer and nearer, growing
                  brighter as it approached, while shouts and mingled voices were distinctly heard.
                  Inspired with new alarm, the two girls sheltered themselves in the shade of a
                  large rock, hoping to escape observation, till this noisy, and seemingly
                  bacchanalian crew had passed. They could see that the boat was full, and that they
                  who rowed, plied the oars with a bold and rapid hand. It came gliding up, with a
                  full sweep, near the very rock by whose shadow they were concealed, and several
                  young men sprang on the bank, but the others dashed merrily on.</p>
               <p>"Augustus cannot be among these," whispered Harriet, as a blustering oath from one
                  met her ear.</p>
               <p>Rose pressed closer to Harriet, without speaking. She thought she recognized his
                  voice, altered as it was in sound, and it pierced her like a dagger.</p>
               <p>"Ha! we have traitors in the camp!" cried one of them, catching a glimpse of the
                  shrinking figures that leaned against the rock; and in a moment they were
                  surrounded.</p>
               <p>"Let me see your faces, my pretty ones," said the foremost of the three; "we did
                  not know we were so tenderly watched."</p>
               <p>They gathered their cloaks more closely around them, and buried their faces in the
                  folds.</p>
               <p>"Come!" said the young man with a bold exclamation, "I will know whether we have
                  got fairies or furies flitting about in the moonlight!"</p>
               <pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC6687-00000205"/>
               <p>He caught hold of the cloak nearest to him with no very gentle grasp, when its
                  relaxing folds suddenly filled his arms, and the slight figure of Rose Somers
                  appeared beautifully defined on the dark rock.</p>
               <p>"Augustus Norwood, can this be you?" exclaimed she, in a tone so sorrowful and
                  indignant, it recalled him at once to a sense of his situation.</p>
               <p>He endeavored to put the cloak round her, but she snatched it from his hand, and
                  throwing it over her own shoulders, walked rapidly forward, almost dragging
                  Harriet, who, weeping and looking back, begged her brother to come home with
                  them.</p>
               <p>"What in the name of Heaven brought you here, at this time of night?" said he,
                  pursuing their steps, and speaking in a loud and irritated voice. "A pretty hour
                  for young girls to be abroad alone!"</p>
               <p>"Better, far better, to be alone," said Rose, bitterly, "than in the company of
                  those who forget they were once gentlemen."</p>
               <p>"Why, Rose, you wouldn't say I am not a gentleman," cried he, forcing a laugh.</p>
               <p>Rose turned and gave him one look, but it was sufficient to confirm her worst
                  fears. An unnatural flush burned on his check, his eyes flashed with the fires of
                  inebriation—his voice had a strained, inflated tone, his whole expression and
                  manner were transformed.</p>
               <p>"We were foolish enough to fear you might be drowned," said Rose; "and forgetting
                  ourselves we came here and exposed ourselves to insult and mortification!"</p>
               <p>"Insult!" repeated he; "you may depend upon it, none shall insult you while I am
                  near." He attempted to take her hand and draw it through his arm, but she shrunk
                  from him with undisguised repugnance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Somers and Mrs. Norwood lived side by side. They were now close to the
                  dwelling of the former. Rose bade Harriet a hasty good-night, and springing
                  through the gate was out of sight in a moment. The brother and sister did not
                  exchange a syllable. They entered their own home, retired to their respective
                  chambers—the one to sleep the leaden slumbers succeeding unnatural excitement, the
                  other to weep over a discovery that filled her heart with bitterness and
                  shame.</p>
               <p>The next morning Augustus did not appear at the breakfast table, and Harriet's
                  pale cheeks and swollen eyes attracted her mother's attention. Harriet, resolving
                  to screen her brother, and to save her mother, if possible, the anguish of such a
                  disclosure, declared she had caught a terrible cold, which was indeed the case,
                  and that she had a bad headache, which was equally true. She was glad to submit to
                  the usual remedies for such complaints, and to be kept a prisoner in her own room
                  the remainder of the day, to avoid meeting with Augustus, whom she dreaded to see.
                  He, too, kept his room, upon the plea of indisposition, and Mrs. Norwood, who
                  feared from his heavy eyes and feverish countenance, he was attacked with some
                  sudden disease, could with difficulty be prevented from sending for a physician.
                  Little Mary hovered around him, though he took no notice of her presence or
                     attention<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6687-00000206"/> tention. The child,
                  unaccustomed to such neglect, stood near him, silent and sad. But, children cannot
                  long restrain the expression of their feelings, and the consciousness of being
                  slighted infused a little bitterness into her loving nature.</p>
               <p>"Brother," said she, "I am glad I never saw you sick before. I shouldn't love you
                  so much as I do."</p>
               <p>"Why?" asked he, sternly.</p>
               <p>"Because it makes your eyes so red, and makes you look cross, too. When mother is
                  sick I love her better than ever, she is so sweet and gentle."</p>
               <p>"I never asked you to stay with me," said he, pushing her from him, as, leaning on
                  his shoulder, she was looking up into his face with her earnest and reproachful
                  gaze.</p>
               <p>The motion was quick and Mary was thrown upon the floor. She was not hurt, but her
                  heart was bruised by his unkindness. She would not have told of it for the world,
                  but she stole away into some dark corner and wept and sobbed herself to sleep.
                  What <emph>his</emph> reflections were, when reason and feeling once more resumed
                  their empire over his mind, may be gathered from his first interview with Rose
                  Somers, after their midnight meeting by the water.</p>
               <p>"You despise me, Rose," said he, stung by her cold, calm reception; "and I deserve
                  your contempt."</p>
               <p>"No," said Rose, "but I pity you, pity you from the bottom of my heart."</p>
               <p>"And I deserve your pity too, for never was a being more wretched than I have been
                  for the last six days. Yet, notwithstanding my present misery, I feel a relief in
                  knowing that you know me as I am, that my fatal propensity is no longer concealed
                  from you, that I am not obliged to act the part of a hypocrite and appear an angel
                  of light, when I am actually in league with the powers of darkness."</p>
               <p>"No, no, no!" interrupted Rose, turning as white as marble; "you shall not say so.
                  You were tempted, you were overtaken; they forced you to join with them, and in a
                  moment of convivial enjoyment you forgot yourself, Augustus. You did not know what
                  you were doing. It was the first, and it shall be the last time. You shall not
                  belie yourself thus to me, who have known you from childhood—I never
                     <emph>will,</emph> I never <emph>can</emph> believe you!"</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, Rose," said the unhappy young man, "while I lay my heart bare
                  before you, even as it will be at the great judgment day. As I hope for mercy
                  then, I will not deceive you now!"</p>
               <p>And she did listen, with her hands joined so closely together, that the blood
                  purpled under the nails, and her eyes fixed upon his face with such an intense,
                  imploring expression, it seemed as if her very existence hung upon the relation he
                  was making. He went back to the days of his boyhood and adolescence, those white
                  days as he called them, when the only passion whose ruling power he felt, was his
                  love for <emph>her,</emph> tender and familiar as that of a brother, but of
                  fourfold strength. He dwelt on the scenes, when placed a stranger in a city of
                  strangers, unknown and undreaded, when he had looked upon the wine "when it<pb
                     n="430-431" xml:id="VAC6687-00000207"/> was red, when it gave its color to the
                  cup," till his senses became maddened by the taste, and sought for a more
                  inebriating draught. "I said to the tempter," continued he, each time, "it shall
                  be the last. Still, when they held the burning bowl to my lips, I could not dash
                  it from me, but tasted and yielded, till conscience, and reason and memory were
                  drowned, and the image of God was defaced within my soul. Then when I awakened
                  from these deadly trances, and remembered how low I had plunged—when I recollected
                  my mother's prayers and admonitions, her confiding affection—when I thought of
                  you, Rose, and all the sweet dreams that had gilded my boyhood—it almost drove me
                  mad. And, oh! Rose,—that night when I returned home, and my mother asked me to
                  read from that sacred volume, whose precepts I had slighted, and told me of the
                  prayers she had offered up for me, when I was myself surrounded by mementos of
                  unpolluted pleasures and holy aspirations,—what I felt, and how I felt, I never
                  can make you know. Such strong resolutions as I made—such earnest vows—and yet you
                  see I have broken them all! In the first hour of temptation I yielded. Those young
                  men have learned, I know not how, my fatal habit, and exerted every art to allure
                  me to expose myself here. Perhaps they were jealous of my influence with you. Sure
                  I am they glory in my shame!"</p>
               <p>He paused, and covering his face with his hands, leaned over the back of his
                  chair, while his frame shook with an ague-like paroxysm. It is affecting even to a
                  hard-hearted person, to see a man weep at the common and natural vicissitudes of
                  life. What must have been the feelings of the young and sensitive Rose, on seeing
                  the tears of Augustus—tears, too, wrung by that most agonizing of all earthly
                     feelings—<emph>remorse!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>She had sat like a statute of stone, during the history of his degradation, pale
                  and tearless, the image of despair, but now the blood rushed back in vivid warmth
                  to her cheeks, and springing to his side she bent over him, and leaning her face
                  on his shoulder, wept audibly. Even when she felt his arms thrown and locked
                  around her as they had sometimes been in childhood, she did not chide him or
                  withdraw, for she would not for the universe have added a feather's weight to the
                  anguish she saw him suffer.</p>
               <p>"Augustus," said she, at length, "do not despair; all will yet be well, if you but
                     <emph>will</emph> it. You are not lost, you cannot be, while you feel so
                  deeply, and when there there are so many hearts that will break in your
                  undoing."</p>
               <p>"And could you, Rose," said he, looking up—"could you forgive me for the past, and
                  trust me for the future, if from this moment I break the iron chain of habit and
                  live one of God's freemen, not the bond slave of Satan? Could you forget the two
                  last years of my life, and remember me, as you knew me, before I yielded to this
                  blasting influence?"</p>
               <p>"Could I—would I?" exclaimed she, eagerly. "Oh! how little do you know me! There
                  needs no oblivious wave to wash out the remembrance of what I never knew. As
                  freely as you have acknowledged, so freely<pb n="432-433"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000208"/> will I forgive. One known act of indiscretion can
                  never efface the truth and affection of years. Be true to yourself, and I will
                  think of you only as the dearest, the best——"</p>
               <p>She stopped, blushing at the involuntary strength of her language, and the gloomy
                  countenance of Augustus lighted up for a moment with the sunny look of his
                  boyhood.</p>
               <p>"Hear me then," cried he, "while I solemnly promise——"</p>
               <p>"Oh! promise not," exclaimed Rose; "make no rash vows, but pray to Almighty God
                  for strength to resist temptation, and He will give it thee. I too will pray for
                  thee even as for my own salvation."</p>
               <p>Augustus listened to her inspiring words, and looked into her kindling eyes, and
                  believed he never could be the monster to betray her confidence, and again prove
                  himself unworthy of the love so triumphant in its faith, so beautiful in its
                  innocence and trust.</p>
               <p>The spring came on—green, bright, gladdening and rejoicing spring—with all the
                  splendor, and freshness and beauty peculiar to the latitude in which they dwelt.
                  Streams of verdure seemed to gush up through the melting snows, the waters
                  sparkled in wreaths of living silver down the hill side and over the plain, waves
                  of melody rolled above amid the branches of the trees, the heavens shone with a
                  deeper blue, the stars flashed with intenser radiance. Rose, like the flower whose
                  name she bore, gathered bloom and sweetness from the blooming season. There was
                  spring-time in her heart and sunshine in her eyes, and smiles and music on her
                  lips. Augustus was ever at her side, all she could wish or hope for. The dark
                  cloud that had threatened to obscure her destiny had rolled away, and she only
                  remembered it to rejoice still more in the brightness of the present and the hopes
                  of the future.</p>
               <p>Months glided on, the vivid bloom of spring melted in the glory of summer, and
                  still Rose was the happiest of the happy. The national festival of freemen
                  approached. The manner in which they were accustomed to celebrate it in this
                  village was peculiarly delightful, for female patriotism and taste were allowed to
                  blend with manly enthusiasm, and gild it with many a decorating tint. After the
                  usual outpourings of eloquence, and the bustle of a public dinner, the gentlemen
                  and ladies met together, towards the sunset hour, on some green plot selected for
                  the occasion, where a bower was erected and a table spread, covered with every
                  variety of cake and fruit, adorned with the flowers of the season, and wreathed
                  with wild-wood garlands. A band of music was stationed in the shade of the trees,
                  that made the grove ring with melody, and blithe hearts respond to the inspiring
                  strains. Augustus had been the orator of the day, and with that graceful, florid
                  eloquence which is so captivating to the eye and to the ear, had elicited
                  universal applause. Rose exulted in the admiration he excited, but when she saw
                  him led away in triumphant procession, she knew that the hour of temptation was
                  come, and she began to tremble. He turned as he passed and met her anxious glance
                  with one so full of love and confidence<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC6687-00000209"/>
                  dence, that she felt ashamed of her momentary fear. She had not time to indulge in
                  any misgivings, for she was chosen the presiding queen of the bower, and in honor
                  of Augustus she wanted it to be decorated with regal beauty. The bower was erected
                  on the banks of the stream already described, and a boat with awnings waited the
                  motion of those who felt disposed to glide on its bosom.</p>
               <p>Rose and Harriet, assisted by the other young maidens of the village, had rifled
                  the woods of their sweets, and little Mary, who had followed them with a hop, skip
                  and jump, every step they took, gathered the buds and blossoms that nestled low in
                  their mossy beds. Her unwearied fingers helped to twine the festoons that swept
                  from tree to tree, linking bough with bough in flowery sisterhood. When the fairy
                  arch was completed, and declared to be perfect in beauty, she filled her apron
                  with some hidden treasure, and seating herself in a remote corner, appeared to be
                  engaged in a mysterious operation. Then springing on her feet, she waved a lovely
                  garland in the air, and running towards Rose, "See," said she, "you are queen
                  to-day, and here is your crown—is it not sweet? and don't she look sweet in it?"
                  continued she, appealing to all around her, as Rose bent her head, and Mary bound
                  the dewy coronet on her brows. All united in paying testimony to the sweetness of
                  Rose, for she was the darling of the village, and sweet was the very epithet to be
                  applied to her.</p>
               <p>Every body said Rose Somers was a sweet looking girl, yet no one had ever called
                  her beautiful. She certainly never had looked so pretty as at this moment, in her
                  simple white dress and crown of wild flowers, the color in her cheeks coming and
                  going, her eyes darkening and sparkling as the martial music swelled on the ear,
                  and her heart told her it was the herald of Augustus. But little Mary herself was
                  an object that attracted every eye. They had twisted rose-buds and myrtle in her
                  flaxen ringlets, encircled her white neck and girdled her waist with wreaths,
                  which she in her innocent childhood delighted to wear. Rose said she looked almost
                  too much like a lamb, decorated for sacrifice, but Mary would not part with any of
                  her ornaments, and wore them with a sportive grace that might have excited the
                  envy of a city belle.</p>
               <p>"There he is, there is brother," exclaimed she, clapping her hands, as the music
                  sounded loud and near, the thick boughs swung back, the military band parted to
                  the right and left, and Augustus was ushered in between, directly in front of the
                  bower, where Rose stood, attended by the fairest maidens of the village.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Rose?" said a young girl by her side, whose arm she had
                  caught with an unconscious grasp.</p>
               <p>"Nothing," answered Rose, but her face turned as white as her dress, and her eyes
                  had a sudden look of anguish and dread. One glance told her that Augustus had
                  forgotten his vow of self-denial, and yielded to the tempter's snare. He had the
                  same high flush on his cheek and unnatural brightness of the eye she too well
                  remembered having once before seen. His hair was disordered, his steps
                  irregular—in short, he had<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC6687-00000210"/> that
                  indescribable air of abandonment, that mingled expression of self-satisfaction and
                  folly, that plainly mark the incipient stages of inebriation.</p>
               <p>"Why, Rose, my bonny Rose," exclaimed he, in an exalted tone, "you do act the
                  queen most rarely. Let the most humble and obedient of your subjects thus pay
                  homage to your majesty." Then dropping on his knees, he burst forth in a flowery
                  and theatrical strain of compliment, she in vain endeavoured to check. Mary
                  laughed at this mock-heroic strain, and thought it very graceful, and admirably in
                  keeping with the joyous occasion; but Rose, who knew too well the cause of his
                  unwonted freedom of speech and manner, felt her heart ache within her. She tried
                  to smile, but in the very effort the tears gushed from her eyes. His sorrow and
                  wonder and sympathy was now as extravagant and high flown as his admiration, and
                  Rose, finding her situation intolerable, drew back behind the boughs of the
                  arbour, where she for a while eluded his observation. Thither Harriet followed
                  her, and had they been at home and alone, the two unhappy girls would have thrown
                  themselves into each other's arms, and wept unrestrainedly.</p>
               <p>There was a young man who had persecuted Rose with very unwelcome attentions
                  during the absence of Augustus, attributing the slight he had received to
                  preference for him, felt for him the bitterest hatred. He it was who had
                  discovered "the burning plaguespot in his heart," and exerted every art to spread
                  it into a consuming flame. At the convivial board, which they had just left, he
                  had seated himself at his side even as Satan sat at the ear of Eve, and whispered
                  evil words of temptation. It was his hand that filled each brimming glass, and
                  mingled with the portion a hotter, more intoxicating beverage. If they who lead
                  many to righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever and ever, what shall be
                  the destiny of those who, like the Dragon in the apocalyptic vision, are not
                  satisfied with going down into the gulf of perdition themselves, but endeavour to
                  drag the sons of light in their train?</p>
               <p>Several of the party were now in the boat, and called upon Augustus to join them.
                  He looked round for Rose and Harriet, and not perceiving them, his eye rested on
                  little Mary, who had been impatiently waiting his notice.</p>
               <p>"Bless your sweet face," cried he, catching the lovely little creature in his
                  arms; "who made such a cherub of you? Come, don't you want to go with me in the
                  boat, and sail like another Robinson Crusoe?"</p>
               <p>Mary threw her arms around his neck in ecstacy at the thought, and Augustus
                  springing into the boat, it pushed from the shore, the oars keeping time to the
                  music as they dipped, and the rays of the setting sun gilded the white foam they
                  left behind.</p>
               <p>Harriet caught a glimpse of Mary, elevated as she was in her brother's arms, as
                  the boat glided on, and, rushing to the bank, she entreated him to return, as she
                  had promised her mother not to suffer Mary to go near the boat or the water.</p>
               <pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC6687-00000211"/>
               <p>"Is she not safe with me?" cried he, laughing; "who will take care of her if I do
                  not?"</p>
               <p>Mary, at the sound of her sister's imploring accents, remembered the parting
                  injunction of her mother, and her heart smote her for her disobedience.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Augustus!" said she, "please let me go back. I forgot that mother forbid
                  me—indeed I did. Let me go to Harriet—she's calling me yet."</p>
               <p>The child bent forward with an earnest emotion towards her sister, to show her
                  willingness to obey her summons. Augustus was standing near the edge of the boat,
                  with one arm thrown around her, while he kept time with the other to the regular
                  rocking of the slight bark. He was entirely unprepared for her sudden, springing
                  motion, and before he was fully aware of losing his unguarded hold, she was seen
                  fluttering through the air, like a wounded bird, and then the waters parted and
                  gushed over her sinking form, the golden hair gleaming for a moment on the
                  surface, then lost in the dark ripples of the stream. Shrieks of agony now mingled
                  with the gay notes that still swelled on the ear; all was confusion and dismay.
                  Augustus plunged into the water after his drowning sister. Harriet and Rose were
                  seen struggling on the bank with those who held them back from the mad attempt of
                  saving her with whom they must have perished.</p>
               <p>At length Augustus appeared with Mary in his arms, but she was cold and
                  insensible. Her lips and cheeks were blue, and her little hands clenched and
                  rigid. She was borne to the nearest house, and the usual means of resuscitation
                  employed; still when her mother came, in answer to the sad summons that had just
                  reached her, she remained as cold as the wave from which she had been drawn.</p>
               <p>After unavailing efforts to restore her she was pronounced dead, and was borne in
                  grief that mocks description to the home she had left a few hours before, the most
                  joyous of human beings. They laid her on a sofa, and sympathizing friends crowded
                  round to catch one more look of the sweet child consigned so early to such an
                  awful doom. Mrs. Norwood knelt down by her side, and clasping her hands together,
                  pressed them on her heart, as if to hold down its murmurings. She lifted her eyes
                  to heaven in wordless prayer for resignation, when a wild scream from Harriet sent
                  the blood rushing through her veins with startling rapidity.</p>
               <p>"She breathes, mother, she breathes!" exclaimed Harriet, throwing herself into her
                  mother's arms with an hysterical cry.</p>
               <p>And truly she did breathe,—faint and uncertain at first the pale tints of life
                  began to steal over the wan hue of death, the rigid hands unclenched, the heavy
                  lids slowly uplifted, an indistinct murmur escaped her lips. It was then the
                  widowed mother wept aloud. The grief was silent, but her joy and gratitude burst
                  forth. She received her living child to her bosom once more, even as Jairus
                  received his daughter from the dead, and she knew that the Son of God was present,
                  though invisible to mortal eye, with heart as tenderly alive to human misery, with
                  arm as omnipotent to save, as when He stood by the grave of Lazarus,<pb
                     n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6687-00000212"/> and wept over him he was about to wake
                  from the slumbers of death. The first words little Mary distinctly uttered were,
                  "Where is brother?"</p>
               <p>And "Where indeed is Augustus?" was repeated by the anxious mother. It was
                  recollected then that Augustus had not been seen since they left the river's side;
                  that when it was declared that Mary was dead, he had exclaimed again and again,
                     "<emph>What dead! Is she dead?</emph>" Then rushed by those who were around
                  her, like a madman, and disappeared.</p>
               <p>A new and agonizing cause of alarm now existed. The fears of Rose and Harriet were
                  too appalling to be expressed. Mrs. Norwood knew not yet the cause of their worst
                  apprehensions, though she was told that it was from his arms that Mary fell.</p>
               <p>All night she sat by the couch of Mary, cherishing warmth in her still shivering
                  frame, praying for her son, fearing she knew not what, and listening to the echo
                  of his name as she sometimes heard it borne on the night wind. Harriet could not
                  remain within; she followed Rose to the scene of their past festivity, where the
                  people were confusedly mingled, looking up and down the stream, and shouting till
                  the sound rolled back again on their ears, the name of Augustus. As the torches
                  and lanterns gleamed fitfully through the shades, Rose beheld a dark object near
                  the bank, and running towards it she discovered the hat of Augustus, with his
                  gloves lying beside it. At these dumb witnesses of his mournful destiny, Rose sunk
                  in speechless agony on the sand, where she lay unnoticed in the excitement and
                  confusion, and when she was found, she was perfectly insensible, clasping the
                  gloves to her bosom, her hair and garments damp and wet with the chill night
                  dews.</p>
               <p>"It was a pity," as a kind neighbor said, who followed her to her own home, where
                  they bore her—"it was a pity to bring her to herself, and see her take on so
                  bitterly."</p>
               <p>The next day the deep, continuous roaring of cannon was heard all along the banks
                  of the river, where the people still thronged, in the hope of discovering the body
                  of him who they supposed had made his own grave in its channel. It was all in
                  vain. The waters, agitated by the concussion, heaved and subsided, and heaved
                  again—then sinking back into a sullen calm, betrayed not the secrets of its
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>For several days the village continued in a state of excitement: but after a while
                  the conviction that Augustus was drowned, being universally felt, all deplored,
                  some pitied, some condemned him; yet all resumed their former occupations, and
                  gradually suffered his name to die away on their lips and his memory from their
                  hearts—all but two families, from which smiles and gladness seemed banished for
                  ever. It was many weeks before Rose was able to leave her room, and when she did,
                  she looked like the ghost of herself. Her long exposure to the night-air, and her
                  exhausting paroxysms of agony, acting on a naturally delicate constitution, had
                  brought on a lingering illness, from which many thought she never would recover;
                  and when she was seen moving about with such a languid step and mournful
                  countenance, and<pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC6687-00000213"/> such an air of
                  broken-heartedness, her friends felt as if they could scarcely congratulate her on
                  her recovery. She went nowhere but to Mrs. Norwood's; except to visit the abodes
                  of sickness and poverty, and when on such errands, her steps grew more light and
                  her eyes less sad, for even disease and chill penury smiled at her approach, and
                  she felt while she could thus impart blessings to others, she did not live in
                  vain. It seemed to her that if Augustus had lived, and she had seen him gradually
                  given up to the dominion of the fatal vice that had been his destruction, she
                  could have ceased to love him; or had he died on the bed of sickness reconciled to
                  his God, and trusting in his Saviour, she could have learned resignation; but
                  there was something so awful and dark and mysterious about his fate, there was so
                  much reason to believe he had committed that deed for which there is no repentance
                  or hopes of pardon, his memory was associated with images of shame and woe and
                  dread. When with his mother and sister, she never breathed his name; she could not
                  do it, but their eyes would often fill with tears when they met, and their voices
                  falter, indicating the subject on which their thoughts were dwelling. Mary was the
                  only one who mourned for him <emph>aloud.</emph> The sorrows of childhood must be
                  expressed in words, and Mary's innocent and overflowing tongue often gave
                  unutterable pain. She was too young to understand their mournful silence, and
                  fearing they were forgetting him, whom she loved so well, she tried to make up, by
                  her own ardent expressions of love and grief, for their suspected injustice to his
                  memory.</p>
               <p>Two years passed away, and the third was rolling on; still Rose, faithful to her
                  early love, refused to listen to other vows. Her former persecutor renewed his
                  addresses, but she turned from him with loathing. She had heard the part he had
                  acted, and looked upon him as the destroyer of Augustus. Harriet was married to a
                  young man, whom she had long known and valued, and gone far from the home of her
                  youth, while Rose clung to Mrs. Norwood, and even as Ruth clave to Naomi, and
                  filled a daughter's place in her bosom.</p>
               <p>One evening, about the twilight hour, Mrs. Norwood sat in the piazza that fronted
                  the dwelling, with Rose and Mary, shaded by the sweet brier and honeysuckle, that
                  ran trailing round the walls. The last sunbeams were melting into shadows, and
                  gave a rich, bronze-like hue to the distant landscape; sprinkling the nearer
                  objects with rays of scattering gold, and fringing the clouds with living crimson.
                  Mary sat with her head leaning on her mother's lap, and her fair ringlet now
                  darkening into brown, were tossed back from her brow, with the wild grace of
                  childhood. She was taller than she was two years before: but her face was scarcely
                  changed. Her eyes were as intensely blue, and they were now lifted up to her
                  mother's face, with that peculiar expression which assimilated her to the likeness
                  of a cherub.</p>
               <p>"I wish I were a painter," said Rose, who sat the other side of Mrs. Norwood; "and
                  I would sketch<pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC6687-00000214"/> this beautiful sunset
                  view, with Mary exactly in her present attitude, looking up into your eyes."</p>
               <p>"And who would paint you, Rose?" said Mary; "for you are the prettiest of the
                  whole."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no," answered Rose, with a sigh and a smile; "I must not be put in at all. I
                  should spoil the picture."</p>
               <p>"Well, you must be sure to put that gentleman in that's coming up the street,"
                  said Mary. "I can see him through trees."</p>
               <p>The path which led to Mrs. Norwood's door was winding, and thickly shaded with
                  trees: so much so, that though they were aware of the stranger's approach to their
                  own door, they could catch but glimpses of his person, till he came to the very
                  steps of the piazza. Before they had time to breathe or speak, he rushed towards
                  Mary and snatching her in his arms, with a wild cry, sank down on his knees and
                  exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Oh! my God—I thank thee—I bless thee—I am not then a murderer." Then falling
                  prostrate at Mrs. Norwood's feet, again repeated the thrilling ejaculation—"My
                  God—I bless thee!"</p>
               <p>There is a joy that baffles description, joy so deep, and overwhelming, it
                  struggles in vain for words and finds utterance only in tears and sobs and sounds
                  resembling woe. As the Widow of Nain received her only son alive, from the bier,
                  as the mourning sisters of Bethany welcomed their brother from the grave, so was
                  the long-lost son, brother and lover greeted. And if there is joy in heaven over
                  the repenting sinner ner and returning prodigal, we may believe the holy angels
                  themselves sympathized in this affecting scene. It was long before sufficient
                  composure was obtained for him to relate, or them to hear, the mystery of his
                  absence explained.</p>
               <p>It was not till after the friends, who had gathered in at the tidings, were
                  departed, (for the news of his return spread like wild-fire through the village)
                  and they were in the retirement of their own household, they could listen to his
                  story. The evening lamps illumined a pale and agitated, but happy looking group,
                  clustered closely round the speaker, while he gave, interrupted by a thousand
                  emotions, the following narration.</p>
               <p>The night of his disappearance, when he heard it positively declared that Mary was
                  dead, he remembered nothing but the wild purpose of flying far as the winds of
                  Heaven could bear him, as if he could fly from himself, or escape from the
                  scorpions that were writhing in his breast. How far he wandered he knew not, nor
                  when his strength and reason forsook him. He found himself, on recovering the use
                  of his senses, in a tent, by the way-side; a most benignant looking gentleman,
                  bending over him, and a lovely lady bathing his temples and chafing his hands,
                  with all a woman's tenderness. They were travellers to the far west, who having
                  provided themselves with every comfort and accommodation, had encamped during the
                  night under the shade of the trees. He had been probably attracted by the glimmer
                  of their light, and having approached it, fell exhausted, chilled and
                     unconscious<pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC6687-00000215"/> conscious of the cares
                  that were extended towards the apparently expiring stranger.</p>
               <p>The next morning he was able to rise, but he had remained so long in his drenched
                  clothes, with such a fiery current burning in his veins, he was seized with a slow
                  fever, and was compelled to accept the offers of these kind Samaritans. They
                  spread a pallet for him on the bottom of the carriage, stopped when he was too
                  weary to go on, nor did they apply their ministrations to his body alone; for
                  their holy conversation was a balm to his wounded spirit, and the despair that had
                  succeeded the keen agonies of remorse, gradually softened into a more godly
                  sorrow. He went with them to their western home, and there he remained, believing
                  his name must be accursed in his own. On the return of health, he assisted his
                  friend in clearing the wilderness, and diffusing around the blessings of
                  civilization and refinements of taste. He had told him his history, and the solemn
                  determination he had made, if God gave him strength to keep it, to make himself a
                  new name and fame, in a place where he was unknown, and to struggle with his
                  prevailing sin, till he conquered even at the sacrifice of life. He did struggle
                  and came off victorious. He could see the wine-cup and the <emph>fire-cup</emph>
                  too, pass by, untempted, for "the voice of the charmer had ceased to charm, charm
                  he never so wisely." It was long before he dared to believe that he was indeed
                  free, that he could walk forth without the dread of returning to the prison-house
                  of shame; but when time had proved the reality of his reformation, he resolved to
                  return once more to the home he had made desolate, and say to his mother, as the
                  prodigal to his injured father:—"I have sinned against Heaven, and against thee,
                  and am no more worthy to be called thy son—but take me to your bosom again, and
                  let me bind up the wounds I have made." He thought of her who had loved him even
                  in his degradation. He dared not think she loved him still, but if he were doomed
                  to see her the wife of another, he felt the punishment was just. He thought too
                  how he would visit the grave of little Mary, and there, with a broken and contrite
                  heart, renew his covenant vows to his Maker, and supplicate his forgiveness and
                  grace. And now he was seated at his mother's side; the forgiven and blest, with
                  that sweet, rosy, loving being, clinging around his neck, in all the warmth and
                  bloom of her loveliness; whom he believed cold and mouldering beneath the clods of
                  the valley, and Rose too, half enclosed in his arms, still faithful and confiding;
                  her eyes beaming with modest love and holy gratitude, bending on that manly
                  countenance, from which every darkening trace was swept away.</p>
               <p>Let it not be said then, that the man "who deliberates is lost." He may deliberate
                  between the choice of virtue and vice; he may even choose the path of vice, and
                  leave the boundaries of virtue, but he may return to wisdom's ways and find them
                  pleasantness, and her paths peace. The Ethiopian <emph>cannot</emph> change his
                  skin, nor the leopard his spots, but <emph>they who have been accustomed to do
                     evil, may learn to do well.</emph>

               <head>Aunt Mercy.</head>
               <p>WE sat together in the little back parlor the evening before our father's
                  departure. He was a sea-captain, and bound for a distant voyage. We had not been
                  separated from him since our mother's death, and oppressed by a sense of coming
                  loneliness, I listened to the autumnal wind that sighed against the windows,
                  thinking it the most melancholy of earthly sounds. My father put his arm
                  affectionately round each of us, as we sat on either side of him, and drew us
                  closer to him. He did not speak for some time, but gazed steadily into the fire,
                  as if he feared to look upon us, lest he should be betrayed into some unmanly
                  weakness. "My daughters," said he at length, "my heart is relieved from great
                  anxiety on your account. I have two letters, received almost simultaneously, both
                  containg affectionate offers of a home to one of you, during my absence. The
                  choice must be left to yourselves."</p>
               <p>"Who are they from?" cried Laura, eagerly; "tell me, dear father, do?"</p>
               <p>"One is from your Aunt Mercy," replied my father. Here Laura's countenance fell.
                  "The other is from Mrs. Belmont, whom you once visited and admired."</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes," exclaimed Laura, with sparkling eyes, "I remember Mrs. Belmont
                  perfectly. She is the most charming woman I ever saw, has the most elegant house,
                  and keeps the most delightful company. I thought when I was there I should be the
                  happiest creature in the world if I could live as she did. Oh! father, let me go
                  to Mrs. Belmont's, and send Fanny to Aunt Mercy's.</p>
               <p>"And what objections have <emph>you</emph> to go to Aunt Mercy's?" said my father,
                  without addressing me, who continued to hold his hand in silence, for my heart was
                  too full to speak.</p>
               <p>"Oh! I never did like Aunt Mercy," said Laura, with a look of disgust. "She is so
                  precise, and formal, and fanatical. She is an old maid, too, you know, and they
                  say they are always peevish and ill-natured. Then she lives in a small house,
                  almost in the wood, and sees no company but the cats. I am sure I would die with
                  home-sickness, if I were to stay with Aunt Mercy."</p>
               <p>"And what do you think Fanny will do?" asked my father, in a tone which I thought
                  breathed of rebuke.</p>
               <p>"Fanny," repeated Laura, as if she were waking to a consciousness of my existence,
                  "why, Fanny is very different from me—and I dare say would content herself very
                  well. Besides, I am the oldest, and have a right to the first choice, and if I
                  choose Mrs. Belmont's, Fanny is obliged to go to Aunt Mercy's, whether she wishes
                  it or not."</p>
               <p>"I should like to see a little more regard for your sister's comfort, Laura," he
                  replied, knitting his brows. "I am sorry to see you manifest so selfish a
                  disposition, and as a just punishment, I shall insist upon the<pb n="450-451"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000217"/> reverse; or, at least, that Fanny should exercise
                  the privilege of selection."</p>
               <p>Laura burst into a passionate fit of tears, declaring that she would rather stay
                  at home alone, and would do so; for, as for going to Aunt Mercy's, it was out of
                  the question.</p>
               <p>"Since you give me the privilege of choosing, dear father," said I, distressed at
                  Laura's violent emotion, and the motive which excited it, "I shall be as happy
                  with Aunt Mercy as I could be with any one while you are absent, and I think it
                  very kind in her to make the offer. I should feel as little at home at Mrs.
                  Belmont's as Laura would at Aunt Mercy's."</p>
               <p>My father laid his hand upon my head, and shading back the ringlets from my
                  forehead, gave me a look of approbation that would have repaid me for the
                  sacrifice of my life, if it were possible to enjoy the reward of such a
                  sacrifice.</p>
               <p>"You are a good child, Fanny," said he, "and you will be a happy one wherever you
                  are. How much your eyes are like your mother's now you are looking down! and you
                  are like her in character too. She was always ready to yield her own gratification
                  when it interfered with the happiness of others. She never thought of herself."
                  Laura looked uneasy while my father was speaking. The pleasure of gratified desire
                  and the mortification of rebuked selfishness struggled in her countenance. "If I
                  ever return," said my father, rising, and walking to and fro with folded arms and
                  bent brow, "we shall see who has made the wisest choice."</p>
               <p>I shall pass over my father's departure and its sad accompaniments. Minute detail
                  is seldom interesting unless it leads to the development of character, and as it
                  is Aunt Mercy's character that I wish to describe, rather than my own, I hasten to
                  the moment when I became an inmate of her household, Laura having previously been
                  received into the home of Mrs. Belmont. I had but a dim recollection of Aunt
                  Mercy, never having seen her since my early childhood. She lived in the deepest
                  seclusion, seldom visited her relatives and friends, and when her visits were made
                  to my mother I was at school, so that it was only through the medium of others I
                  had obtained my knowledge of her character. I knew she must be far advanced in
                  years, being the sister of my grandmother, not of my mother, and a feeling of awe
                  began to steal over me as I drew near her dwelling, a kind of wintry chill,
                  indicating that the snows of life were near. It was a clear, autumnal evening; the
                  dark brown woods skirted the road on either side, and here and there, through the
                  rustling foliage, I could see the stars sparkle and the deep blue sky shining, and
                  sometimes I could catch a glimpse of waters flashing through the underbrush, and
                  sometimes I could hear the low, gurgling sound of a stream, whose murmurs alone
                  revealed its existence. The great secret of melancholy seemed diffused over the
                  world. I felt as if I were alone in creation. I had no companion with me in the
                  carriage. I had left no friends behind. My father was now launched on the billows,
                  perhaps never to return. My mother slept the last, deep sleep. I was going to one
                  who, from age,<pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC6687-00000218"/> sanctity, and personal
                  peculiarities, seemed as far removed from the sphere in which I had been moving,
                  as the planets above, revolving in their lone and distant orbits. Happy they who
                  have never felt that orphanage of the soul which came over me with such a dreary
                  and oppressive power. As the carriage turned into the yard, the silence
                  surrounding the low white dwelling, almost embosomed in shade—the solitary light
                  that gleamed through one curtained window—the complaining notes of a whippoorwill
                  perched near the wall—added to the solemnity of the hour, and imagination,
                  delineating the form of Aunt Mercy with cold grey eyes, and wintry countenance,
                  and ancient costume, threw me into such a state of nervous debility, I had hardly
                  strength to descend from the carriage and enter the door that opened as if by
                  magic to receive me, for I had heard no sound of life. At first I thought it was a
                  statue standing on the threshold of the inner apartment, so still, and pale, and
                  erect it looked, arrayed in a robe of white, whose folds fell voluminously from
                  the neck to the feet, and remained as calm as those of a winding sheet. A cap with
                  a close crimped border surrounded the face, whose pallid hue corresponded with the
                  death-like impression the dress had made. I trembled as I approached, as if an
                  inhabitant of another world were waiting to receive me, when the tall, still
                  figure, extending its hands, spoke in a sweet, tremulous voice, "Fanny, my child,
                  is it you? welcome to the home of the aged."</p>
               <p>At the sound of those kind, <emph>living</emph> accents, the spell of supernatural
                  awe was broken, and throwing myself self into the arms which involuntarily opened
                  to enfold me, I wept myself into calmness. I was hardly conscious of what was
                  passing around me, till I found myself seated by a cheerful fire, whose blaze
                  revealed, while it warmed, the pure, white walls, the white curtains, that dropped
                  to the floor without a single festoon, the white, ungirdled dress of Aunt Mercy:
                  and by its bright reflection, I could see too, her gray parted hair, divided with
                  the precision of a geometrical line, and her dark, deep-set eyes, that beamed like
                  lamps through the mists of age. There was a fascination in the glance of those
                  eyes, as they were steadfastly fixed on me. They did not seem looking at my face,
                  but my soul. The memory, not the fire of human passion slumbered in their solemn
                  depths. But, when withdrawing their fixed gaze from me, and lifting them upwards,
                  she remained for a few moments in the same attitude, with her hands folded, there
                  was a holy and sublime abstraction, that showed her thoughts were withdrawn from
                  all external objects, and were holding communion with the Great Invisible. Then
                  again turning to me, she said, as if thinking aloud, rather than addressing
                  me—"When I last saw her, she was little more than a smiling infant; and now she is
                  what her mother was full twenty years ago. Time! time! what a solemn thing is
                  time. It carries us on, day and night, without slumbering or pausing, and we heed
                  it not, till borne like me, almost to the shores of eternity, we listen with
                  wonder to the dashing of the billows we have passed over, and look back upon the
                  dark and troubled waters that heave<pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC6687-00000219"/>
                  themselves into rest on the borders of the promised land."</p>
               <p>I gazed with reverence on this hoary mariner of time, thus surveying with a
                  backward glance the untravelled wilderness before me; but I sighed to think she
                  must have survived the affections and yearning sympathies of her kind, and that I
                  must learn to repress in her presence the ebullitions of youthful emotion. Her
                  next words convinced me how erroneous was this conclusion.</p>
               <p>"I pity you, my child. You have a gloomy prospect before you, as the companion of
                  age and loneliness. But the fountain of love is not dried up in my veins. The
                  current flows warm and deep beneath the ice. If you seek wisdom, rather than
                  pleasure, you may not in after years reflect with sorrow that you lingered a
                  little by the way-side, communing with an aged pilgrim, who could tell you
                  something of the mysteries of the journeys of life. And something too, I trust,"
                  added she, placing her hand reverently on the Bible, which lay on the table by her
                  side, "of that eternal country whither the young, as well as the old, are rapidly
                  travelling."</p>
               <p>Though I had been but a half hour in Aunt Mercy's presence, I had already gathered
                  some precious lessons, and I looked forward to the hoard of wisdom I might acquire
                  during my daily communion with her. Tenderness began to mingle with the awe she
                  inspired, and when I retired to my own room, which was an apartment adjoining
                  hers, I thought though the hours passed with my venerable relative might be very
                  serious ones, they need not consequently be unhappy. When I first entered the
                  chamber, however, I could not repress a nervous shudder. The same cold uniformity
                  of white was visible that distinguished the room below. White walls, white
                  curtains to bed and windows, and an old-fashioned toilet table, with a long,
                  flowing, white muslin petticoat, all presented a most wintry aspect. "Surely,"
                  said I, "Aunt Mercy has selected white, because it is the livery of angels. I
                  shall not dare to think an unpolluted thought, surrounded by such emblematic
                  purity. I shall be reminded of Him in whose sight 'the heavens are not clean,' and
                  'who sitteth on a white throne in the midst of his glory.'"</p>
               <p>The powerful influence of Aunt Mercy's solemn character, was already visible in my
                  reflections. That influence pursued me even in my dreams; for I dreamed that I was
                  sailing alone in a little bark over an ocean, that seemed illimitable in extent,
                  and unfathomable in depth, and that a tall, white figure, defined on the dark and
                  distant horizon beckoned me onward, and ever and anon lifted a lamp that blazed in
                  her right hand, and sent a long stream of brightness over the abyss of waters. As
                  I came nearer and hearer, and the boat glided with inconceivable swiftness, the
                  lamp flashed with such intolerable splendour, that it awoke me, and opened my
                  eyes, the sunbeams darted through the opening of the curtains directly in my face,
                  and explained the vision of the lamp. My first though was a dread of Aunt Mercy's
                  displeasure for slumbering so late, for I had heard that she breakfasted<pb
                     n="456-457" xml:id="VAC6687-00000220"/> fasted at sunrise, but the kind manner
                  in which she greeted me when I descended dispelled my fears.</p>
               <p>"I knew you must be fatigued from your journey," said she, "and would not suffer
                  you to be wakened; but to-morrow we will rise together, for your youthful frame
                  can hardly require more hours for repose than mine. I always think when the Lord
                  of day is on his way rejoicing and scattering blessings in his path, it is a shame
                  for us to be laggards behind."</p>
               <p>I blushed when I recollected what a laggard I had been, and that I, the young and
                  buoyant, had even this duty to learn from the aged and infirm. Yet I could hardly
                  call Aunt Mercy infirm. Her figure was still erect and dignified, her step
                  unfaltering; and though time's engraving hand had left its tracery on her cheek
                  and brow, her eyes at times, not only flashed with the brilliancy, but expressed
                  the energy of earlier years. She seldom smiled, but when she did, her countenance
                  exhibited an appearance of indescribable serenity, reminding me of a lake by
                  moonlight, when the wind just curls its surface, and the rays gently quiver in the
                  motion. The first day I was excited by the charm of novelty. The perfect quiet and
                  neatness that reigned in the household; the clock-work regularity with which every
                  thing was performed; the industry that harmonised so beautifully with this order
                  and tranquillity, astonished while it delighted me. It seemed impossible to me
                  that human beings could live, and move, and work with so little bustle. Yet there
                  was constant activity. Aunt Mercy herself was never idle a moment; she was either
                  knitting, sewing or reading; indeed, her knitting needles seemed a part of her
                  fingers, and the stocking to grow under her touch, from a natural, not an
                  artificial process. I wondered why she manufactured so many articles, for which
                  she could have no possible use; but I soon learned that many were the feet she
                  covered by her industry, as well as the mouths she fed with her bounty. Never was
                  name more appropriately given, for far as her liberal hand could reach, her
                  benefactions and her care extended. She never encouraged idleness or vice, but
                  wherever there was infancy, orphanage, infirmity, and age, united with poverty,
                  her charities descended gently and unostentatious as the dews of heaven.</p>
               <p>"You make me ashamed of the indolence of my past life," said I, as I watched her
                  unwearid fingers; "I feel as if I had lived in vain; I have been praised because I
                  was willing to do something for myself, and now I feel that it is only what we do
                  for others deserves commendation."</p>
               <p>"Praise is sweet," replied Aunt Mercy, "from the lips of those we love, but if we
                  do good to others for the <emph>sake</emph> of this reward, we sacrifice the
                  blessing of Him who has presented to us higher and holier motives for action. Do
                  not praise me, my Fanny, because I endeavour to do diligently what my hands find
                  to do,' for the shadows of twilight are falling round me, and that dark night will
                  soon come, wherein 'no man can work.'"</p>
               <p>It may be believed by some, that the solemnity of Aunt Mercy's language, her
                  constant allusions to<pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC6687-00000221"/> death and
                  eternity, and the inspired quotations with which her conversation abounded, would
                  fill my young and ardent imagination with gloom and terror. But it was not so;
                  they exalted, instead of depressing me; they created in me a thirst for sacred
                  knowledge, a spirituality of feeling as sublime as it was novel—I could exclaim
                  with a more heavenly ambition, than that which animated the Egyptian enchantress,
                  "I feel immortal longings in me."</p>
               <p>It was a somewhat novel sight, to see such close companionship and increasing
                  congeniality of feeling, between two beings, so far removed by age from each
                  other—the snows of winter only drew us closer together, and I almost dreaded to
                  witness the springtime of the year, lest in the midst of its opening splendors, I
                  should lose something of her divine instructions. An occasional letter from Laura,
                  varied the pleasing monotony of my existence; she always addressed me as "poor
                  Fanny"—then as if that expression of condolence satisfied her sisterly affection,
                  she expatiated on her gay and happy life, and the pleasures that courted her
                  enjoyment; her volatile mind flew from one subject to another, from the theatre to
                  the ball-room, from the ball-room to the concert, &amp;c., with bewildering speed;
                  and with all these dazzling scenes she mingled descriptions of attending
                  gentlemen: some had "eyes of fire," others "tongues of eloquence," and "lips of
                  music," and all were included in the compendious epithet, "divine." I should have
                  profited little by the example and precepts of the evangelical Aunt Mercy, if I
                  had not revolted at the application of this term; I grieved at the levity of her
                  sentiments; I did not envy her the pleasures that had such an intoxicating
                  influence on her heart; I did not sigh for the admiration of that sex from whose
                  society I was so entirely excluded; I had never been accustomed to it, and the
                  rapturous expressions of Laura astonished my young simplicity. One evening, after
                  the perusal of one of these letters, as I sat at Aunt Mercy's side, I ventured to
                  address her in a more familiar manner than I had ever done before. I longed to
                  hear her explain the mystery of her lonely life. "Dear Aunt Mercy," said I, taking
                  her hand in mine, and looking earnestly in her face, "do you think it a sin to
                  love?" She actually started at the question, and I felt her hand tremble in my
                  clasp.</p>
               <p>"Do you ask idly?" said she, fixing her deep eyes with a melancholy gaze on my
                  face, "or do you, child as you are, speak from the heart's dictates.</p>
               <p>"No," answered I, blushing at the suggestion. "I know nothing yet of love, and
                  judging from Laura's allusions, I think I never shall. But I have often wondered
                  why you, who must have been very beautiful indeed, when young"—here a faint smile
                  glimmered over Aunt Mercy's features, a lingering spark of vanity, flashing
                  through the shades of threescore and ten—"why you should have been"—I began to
                  hesitate, for I could not allow myself to use Laura's expression, and say "an old
                  maid"—then after a moment's reflection, I added, "why you should have been single,
                  when almost every one marries; I thought, perhaps, you believed it sinful to love
                  any one else<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC6687-00000222"/> but God." I would have
                  given any thing to have recalled the expression of my childish curiosity; I was
                  terrified at the emotion exhibited in her usual placid countenance; her eyes
                  assumed a look of wild anguish, contrasting fearfully with their wonted calm,
                  religious glance; then slowly lifting them to Heaven, and clasping her withered
                  hands together, she exclaimed, "Sinful! oh! my Father!—sinful indeed must be the
                  passion, whose memory even now can raise such a tumult in these wintry veins; I
                  thought all was peace here," continued she, unclasping her hands, and pressing
                  them tightly on her breast, "the peace of God that passeth all understanding; but
                  no, no, the troubled waters are heaving, heaving still." As she reiterated the
                  last words, her head bowed lower and lower, her whole frame shook, and tears
                  gathering in large drops, glided down her cheeks, through channels, which had long
                  been dry. I felt as if I had committed sacrilege in thus disturbing the holy calm
                  of her soul; a burst of flame, rising from the still waters that cover the buried
                  cities of the plain, could not be more awful or surprising, than this storm of
                  human passion, thus convulsing the bosom of age. I knew not in what manner to
                  express my penitence and sorrow. I wept; I threw my arms around her; I actually
                  knelt at her feet and implored her to forgive me. The attitude roused her from her
                  trance-like state; she held out her right hand, and commanded me to rise. I rose
                  and stood before her pale and trembling, like a culprit uncertain of her doom.</p>
               <p>"Leave me, child, leave me," she cried, "till I gain composure, from the only
                  source from which the weary and heavy laden can find rest—long, long years have
                  rolled away since any human being has struck the chord your hand has pressed. I
                  thought it had ceased to quiver—I have deceived myself; I feel humbled in the
                  dust; I would humble myself still more before the mighty hand of God. Leave me
                  alone, my child, and when I am calm once more, you shall learn the history of my
                  youth, and may you profit by its mournful lesson."</p>
               <p>I withdrew to my chamber, grieved and agitated, yet awaiting with impatience the
                  expected summons. But I heard Aunt Mercy enter her own room and close her door,
                  without recalling me to her presence. She always kept a light burning during the
                  night, that she might not disturb her servants, if one were required, but this
                  night it was extinguished, and accustomed as I had been to see its rays streaming
                  beneath the door, I shuddered at the darkness, of which my rashness had been the
                  cause. I trembled when I reflected on the might of human passion—"Terrible,
                  terrible," thought I, "must it be in its strength, if even in decay it can triumph
                  over the coldness of age, and roll its wild waves over the traces the Spirit of
                  God has written on the soul. Let <emph>me</emph> be spared its desolating power;
                  let me live on as I now do, calm and passionless, striving to walk in the path of
                  duty, with an eye directed to Heaven, and a heart devoted to God. Here, in this
                  solitude, I am secure from temptation, and can know nothing of the<pb n="462-463"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000223"/> struggles, of which to-night I have been a fearful
                  witness."</p>
               <p>The next morning I almost feared to look at Aunt Mercy, expecting to see the same
                  wild and agitated countenance, but the placidity of Heaven was on her brow. There
                  might be an air of deeper humility; of more saintly meekness, if that were
                  possible, but there was no other change. I felt a tenderness for her I had never
                  experienced before. Aunt Mercy, the anchorite, the saint, was a being I
                  reverenced; but Aunt Mercy, loving and suffering, was a being I loved. The day
                  passed away, as usual, in industry and quiet, but when the evening came on, and we
                  were seated again, side by side, at the lonely hearth, my heart began to palpitate
                  with expectation, for Aunt Mercy suffered her knitting to remain untouched in her
                  basket, and her book lay unopened on the table.</p>
               <p>"My dear Fanny," said she, "your asking eyes shall not seek mine in vain; I have
                  been steadily looking at the past, and am astonished at the calmness with which I
                  can now review events, from which last night I recoiled with such dread; I have
                  not slept, but prayed, and towards the dawn of morning, it seemed as if an angel
                  came and ministered unto me. Like Jacob, I had wrestled for the blessing and
                  prevailed. It is humbling to me to know that the reverence with which you have
                  regarded me will be diminished, and that you will look upon me hence-forth as a
                  sinful and sorrowing woman; and I should rejoice that you will no longer ascribe
                  to an erring creature, perfections which belong to God alone.</p>
               <p>"When I was young—can you roll back the winters that have frosted my head, and
                  restore me to the spring-time of life? If you can you must think of me, at this
                  moment, not as I am, but as I was, with the bloom of youth on my cheek, and its
                  hopes warm in my heart. Let this thought, my child, check the high throbbings of
                  youthful vanity; as sure as you live to reach the confines of age, you will, like
                  me, present but a faded image of what you once have been; the eyes, those windows
                  from which the soul looks forth, will be <emph>darkened</emph> and the grasshopper
                  prove a burthen to those elastic limbs! But the soul itself, my child, is
                  undecaying and immortal; and can smile calmly over the ruins of the body, in the
                  grandeur of its own imperishability."</p>
               <p>She paused, and as I gazed wistfully in her face, I thought that Ossian could
                  never have seen such a countenance as Aunt Mercy's, when he said that age was
                  "dark and unlovely," for to me she was still beautiful, in her piety and meekness,
                  with the chastened memories of other years blending, as they now were, with the
                  holiest hopes of Heaven.</p>
               <p>"When I was young," continued she, "I was like you, the companion of an aged
                  relative, though my mother was living; but having the charge of a large family,
                  she was willing to yield to my grandmother's wishes, that I might be taken into
                  her household, even as her own child. I was the youngest of the family, and had
                  never been out, as it is called, into the world,<pb n="464-465"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000224"/> so I was contented in my new home, where I had
                  leisure to indulge in my favorite amusement—reading. My grandmother,
                  unfortunately, had a large library of ill-assorted works, a great portion of which
                  were romances and plays. She never restrained me in my choice, saying she had
                  always read every thing she liked, and had never been injured by this
                  indiscriminate reading, and she saw no reason why children should be wiser than
                  their grandmothers. She was fond of hearing me read aloud to her, and all the long
                  winter evenings, while she plied her knitting needles, I amused her and delighted
                  myself with the wildest and most extravagant productions. But there were some
                  volumes containing scenes so highly wrought, which excited such a thrilling
                  interest in my bosom, I I could not read them to another. These I reserved for my
                  secret perusal; and when summer built its green bowers, I used to conceal myself
                  in their shades, and perusing alone these impassioned pages, forgetting every
                  thing but the visions they inspired, I became a vain and idle dreamer. The
                  realities of life were insipid to me; and I was happy only when breathing the
                  atmosphere of the ideal world. My grandmother never reproved me for my wanderings.
                  She did not seem to miss my companionship, for, in the genial season, she loved to
                  sit in the open door, and look at the flowers as they opened to the sunbeams, and
                  listen to the songs of the birds as they made their nests in the trees that shaded
                  the walls. I had one brother, two or three years older than myself, who always
                  visited me during his college vacations, and transformed our quiet dwelling to a
                  scene of gaiety and amusement. Arthur was a light-headed, frolicksome youth, with
                  a temperament very different from mine. <emph>He</emph> loved to sport with the
                  foam of the ocean; <emph>I</emph> to fathom the depths of its waves. And now,
                  Fanny, look on me no longer. I would not waver in my purpose, and I cannot bear
                  that wistful gaze; it melts me, and I would have my eyes dry and my heart
                  firm.</p>
               <p>"Poor Arthur came to us the last year of his collegiate term, accompanied by a
                  classmate of whom he had often talked, Frederick Cleveland. I said he had often
                  spoken of him; and to my romantic ear his name implied all those graces and
                  accomplishments I had never yet seen embodied. Grave even to pensiveness; pale
                  almost to feminine delicacy; yet with a deep-toned voice and manly figure, he
                  formed a striking contrast to my merry, blooming, and boyish brother. Arthur
                  pursued his accustomed sports, fishing and hunting; Cleveland soon learned to
                  linger behind, finding more congeniality in my enthusiasm and poetry of feeling.
                  He was a poet himself; and he loved to read his own strains to one who listened
                  with an ear so rapt as mine. He was a naturalist; and as we walked together, he
                  explained to me the wondrous laws of nature, and gave me enlarged and elevated
                  views of the creating power. He was an astronomer and as we stood beneath the
                  starry heavens, he directed my gaze to the planets walking in their brightness,
                  and endeavored to carry my soul into the depths of infinity, and teach it to take
                  in some faint glimpses of God's unimaginable glory. Fanny, I thought not of my
                     God,<pb n="466-467" xml:id="VAC6687-00000225"/> but of him. I forgot the
                  Creator in adoration of the creature he had made. He departed, and existence was a
                  blank to me; or rather, it was filled with one image, one ever multiplying, yet
                  never changing image. My first thought at morning was not an aspiration of
                  gratitude to the Divine Being, whose wings of love had overshadowed and sheltered
                  me during the darkness of night, but a remembrance of Cleveland. My last thought,
                  when I closed my eyes in sleep, did not ascend to Him, in whose awful presence I
                  might be ere the midnight hour, but lingered round one, a frail creature of the
                  dust like myself. You asked me, Fanny, if love was sinful. Not that love which,
                  emanating from a heart which, conscious of its weakness and its dependence on God,
                  sees in the object of its affections, a being of clay, yet an heir of immortality;
                  a traveller of time, whose goal is eternity; not that love which, purified from
                  earthly fires, glows with a divine ardor, and mingles with the celestial flame
                  that rises from the soul to the source of everlasting love and light. But the
                  pagan maiden, who pours out her life-blood at the feet of her idol-god, is not
                  more of an idolator than I was, the baptized daughter of a Christian mother.</p>
               <p>"Winter glided slowly away. My grandmother's sight entirely failed, and I was
                  compelled to become eyes to the blind, and also feet to the weary, for her
                  increasing infirmities confined her to her arm-chair. I performed these duties,
                  but with a listless spirit; and, could she have looked upon me, she must have
                  known that my thoughts were wandering. At length spring returned, and she had her
                  arm-chair moved into the open air, and as the fragrance of the season floated
                  round her, and its melodies breathed into her ear, she revived into child-like
                  cheerfulness. The time for my brother's annual visit returned, and Cleveland once
                  more accompanied him. Even now, when years gliding over years have dimmed the
                  memories of the past, and religion, I trust, has sanctified them, I cannot recall
                  those hours without a glow like that of sunshine, pervading my wasted being. But
                  the gloom, the horror of thick darkness that followed! One day, as Cleveland and
                  myself were sitting at the foot of an elm tree, reading from the same book, Arthur
                  passed us with his gun in his hand, his green hunting pouch swung over his
                  shoulder, and his dog bounding before him. He laughed, looked back, called
                  Cleveland a <emph>drone,</emph> then went gaily on. How long he was gone I know
                  not, for the happy take no note of hours; but the sun was nearly setting, when he
                  returned by the same path. I felt a sensation of embarrassment that I had lingered
                  so long, and, looking at Cleveland, I saw the color on his cheek was deepened. The
                  sky was reddening with the clouds that generally gather around the setting sun,
                  and their reflection gave a beauty and brightness to his face that I had never
                  seen before. Arthur seemed animated with more than his usual vivacity.
                  'Cleveland,' said he, with mock gravity, 'that blush bespeaks the consciousness of
                  guilt. I have long thought you a criminal, and you must now suffer the penalty due
                  to your crimes. Die, then, base robber, without judge or jury.' Then, aiming
                     his<pb n="468-469" xml:id="VAC6687-00000226"/> gun like an experienced
                  marksmen, his eye sparkling with mirth, he shot—and Cleveland fell."</p>
               <p>Here Aunt Mercy paused, and a long silence ensued. I dared not look at her, as she
                  thus bared the fountain of her grief. I felt as if the death shot had penetrated
                  my own heart. I started at the sound of her voice when she again resumed her
                  narrative, it was so hollow and broken.</p>
               <p>"Yes! he fell by a brother's hand. I saw him extended at my feet, and the grass
                  crimsoned with the blood that gushed from the wound. I saw Arthur dash down his
                  gun, rush forward, and throwing himself on the bleeding body, exclaim, "Gracious
                  Father! what have I done?" "Done!" cried I, pushing him away with frantic
                  violence, and clasping the murdered Frederick in my arms, "Done! you have killed
                  him—you have killed him;" and I reiterated the words till they became a piercing
                  shriek, and the air was rent with my cries of agony. I remember how he looked—with
                  what bloodless cheeks and lips he bent over him—what indescribable anguish and
                  horror spoke from his eyes! I remember, too, how my blind old grandmother, roused
                  by my shrieks,—came groping to the spot, and dabbled her hands unconsciously in
                  the blood of the victim. It was she who cried, "he may yet be saved;" and Arthur
                  flew for a physician, and dragged him to the very tree, and looked him in the
                  face, while he sought the symptoms of that life which was gone for ever. My Fanny,
                  I dare not describe the madness of despair that took possession of my soul. I
                  rejected all human consolation; I sought no divine comforter; I knew not that
                  there was a balm in Gilead, or a heavenly Physician near. My poor grandmother
                  tried to soothe my grief, but I turned away from her in bitterness. My brother
                  attempted to approach me, but I fled from him as from a monster, and hid myself
                  from his sight. He wrote to me, entreating me to forgive him. He painted the
                  misery he endured, the remorse that was consuming him; and yet he was innocent,
                  innocent of everything but levity, whose excess is criminal. He knew not, that the
                  gun was loaded; for a boy, who was hunting like himself, had taken his rifle,
                  which he had left for a few moments leaning against a tree, and substituted his
                  own in its stead. It was an instrument of inferior value, though of similar
                  appearance, and contained a heavy load. These circumstances were afterwards made
                  known to him, and explained the mystery of Cleveland's death. Poor, unhappy
                  Arthur! he was innocent, and yet I loathed him. I made a vow that I would never
                  see him more. "Tell him," said I, "that I forgive him, but I can never live in his
                  sight; I can never look upon him but as the destroyer of all I held dear." Finding
                  me inexorable, he left me to my sullen and resentful sorrow, to seek friends more
                  kind and pitying. My sole occupation, now, was to wander abroad, and seat myself
                  under the elm tree which had witnessed the awful tragedy, and brood over its
                  remembrance. Oh! how hard and selfish must have been my heart, that could have
                  resisted the prayers and tears of my only brother; that could have turned from a
                  doting grandmother, whose sightless eyes pleaded so painfully in his behalf;
                     that<pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC6687-00000227"/> could have left her to the care
                  of menials, instead of ministering to her declining age and smoothing her passage
                  to the grave! But that hard heart was yet to be broken. The prophet's wand was
                  near. I received a summons to come to my brother, who was dying. He raved for his
                  sister; he could not die without seeing her once again. I felt like one waking
                  from a terrible dream, in which the incubus had been brooding like a demon on the
                  soul! A voice cried in my ear, "Thou too wilt be a murderer, less innocent than
                  he, for thou knewest what thou wast doing." I obeyed the summons, but it was too
                  late—he was dead! I saw him in his winding-sheet—the brother whom my unrelenting
                  lips had vowed never to behold again; with his last breath he had called on my
                  name, and prayed me to forgive him! I stood and gazed upon him with dry and
                  burning eyes. The merry glance was dim and fixed; the glowing cheeks sunken and
                  white; and the smiling lips closed for ever. I had hung over the corpse of my
                  lover, my bosom had been moistened by the life drops that oozed from his own, and
                  I thought I had drunk the cup of sorrow to its bitterest dregs. But I now learned
                  that there were dregs more bitter still. Oh! the anguish of remorse; surely it is
                  a foretaste of the undying worm, of the fire that never can be quenched; I could
                  not bear its gnawings—its smothered, consuming flames; I was laid for months on a
                  bed of sickness, in the same chamber where my poor Arthur breathed his last. I
                  thought I was dying. I did not wish to live, but I recoiled from the dark futurity
                  which stretched illimitably tably before me; I shrunk from the idea of a holy and
                  avenging God; I, the unforgiving, could I hope for forgiveness? I heard, as it
                  were, the voice of the Lord saying, "The voice of thy brother's blood cries to me
                  from the ground;" and I looked in vain for a city of shelter, where my soul could
                  fly and live. I revealed to no one what was passing within. In the sullen secresy
                  of despair, I resolved to meet the doom which I believed to be irrevocable. Like
                  the Spartan boy, who sat unmoved while the hidden animal was preying on his
                  vitals, glorying in the pangs he had the fortitude to endure, I lay on my bed of
                  torture silent and unmurmuring: feeling that the agonies I suffered, and which I
                  expected to suffer, as long as Almighty vengeance could inflict them, or the
                  immortal spirit bear, were a sufficient expiation for my cruelty and guilt. I
                  shudder, as I recall the workings of my soul; I looked upon myself as the victim
                  of an uncontrollable destiny, of an omnipotent vindictive Being, who, secure in
                  his own impassibility, beheld with unpitying eye the anguish he caused. Had I
                  created myself? Had I asked for the gift of existence? Was mine the breath which
                  had warmed the senseless dust of the valley with passions so fiery and untameable;
                  or mine the power to restrain their devastating course? As well might I be
                  responsible for the ruin caused by elemental wrath. Oh! Fanny, had I died in this
                  awful frame! Had my rebellious spirit then been ushered into the presence chamber
                  of the King of kings, thus blasphemous and defying! But he who remembers we are
                  dust, who, tempted once himself,<pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC6687-00000228"/> has
                  pity on human weakness, gently withdrew his chastening hand. He raised me from my
                  sick bed, and bid me live. I returned to my grandmother, who was now helpless as a
                  child, and who wept like an infant when she heard my voice once more. The Bible,
                  the only book in her library which I formerly passed over as too uninteresting to
                  read, was now taken from the shelf and laid on the table by her bedside; on my
                  knees I read its sacred pages. With no teacher but the Holy Spirit, I prosecuted
                  the sublimest study in the universe, and as I studied, I felt a holy illumination
                  pervading the darkened recesses of my soul. I saw myself in the mirror of eternal
                  truth, in all my pride, rebellion, ingratitude, and heaven-daring hardiness—and I
                  loathed the picture. The more I abhorred myself, the more I adored the
                  transcendent mercy of God, in prolonging my life for repentance and reformation.
                  Like Mary, I arose and prostrated myself at the feet of the Saviour, bathed them
                  with such tears of sorrow and love, it seemed as if my heart were melting in the
                  fountain. I loved much; I felt as if I were forgiven; and ten thousand times ten
                  thousand worlds would not purchase the hope even of that blessed forgiveness. My
                  aged grandmother, too, placed as she was on the confines of two worlds,
                  acknowledged that it had been reserved for that moment for the power and glory of
                  religion to be manifested in her soul. She had hitherto rested in quietude, in the
                  consciousness of a blameless life; but, about to appear in the presence of
                  infinite purity as well as justice, the life which had seemed so spotless, assumed
                  a dark and polluted aspect, and she felt that if she ever joined the white-robed
                  throng which surround the throne of the Everlasting, with branching palms in their
                  hands, and hymns of glory on their lips, her raiments, like theirs, must be washed
                  white in the blood of the Lamb. She died in peace, in hope, in faith, bequeathing
                  me her little fortune, and, what was more precious still, her blessing. Blessed,
                  for ever blessed, be the God of Israel, that I have been so gently led down the
                  declivity of life, and that I can hear without dismay the rolling of the waves of
                  Jordan, over which my aged feet must shortly pass; and, blessed too be his holy
                  name, that he has brought you hither to minister to my infirmities, listen to my
                  feeble counsels, and close my dying eyes."</p>
               <p>Aunt Mercy rose, laid her hand for a moment solemnly on my head, and retired. I
                  had wept without ceasing, during the latter part of her narrative, and long after
                  I had laid my head on my pillow, I continued to weep. I wept for the ill-fated
                  Cleveland; the unhappy Arthur; for Aunt Mercy, unrelenting and despairing, then,
                  sorrowing and repenting; I wept to think what a world of tribulation I had
                  entered, and prayed that I might never know the strength and tyranny of human
                  passion. I had always thought it a fearful thing to die; but now it seemed more
                  fearful still to live in a world so full of temptation, with hearts so prone to
                  yield, surrounded by the shadows of time, which seem to us <emph>realities,</emph>
                  and travelling on to an invisible world, which seems so shadowy and remote. The
                  mystery of my being oppressed me, and I sought<pb n="474-475"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000229"/> to fathom what is unfathomable, till I remembered
                  the sublime interrogation of Scripture, "Who can find out the Almighty unto
                  perfection? He is higher than heaven—what canst thou do? Deeper than hell—what
                  canst thou know?" I acknowledged my presumption, and, humbled and submissive, felt
                  willing to wait the great and final day of God's revealing.</p>
               <p>The next morning, Aunt Mercy requested me to accompany her in a walk. It was a
                  mild, sunny morning, and the breath of spring, floating over the hills, was
                  beginning to melt the frosts of winter. I thought she was going on an errand of
                  charity, till she turned into a path, to which the leafless shrubbery on either
                  side now gave a dreary appearance, and led me to a tree, whose bare spreading
                  branches bent over a rustic bench, that was seen at its roots. I trembled, as I
                  approached the spot, for I knew it was there the blood of Cleveland had been
                  spilled. "This, then," thought I, "is the very tree that witnessed, almost
                  simultaneously, the vows of love and the tears of agony."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Aunt Mercy, as if I had spoken aloud, "this is the spot where, more
                  than fifty years ago, in the flower of youth, he fell! His body sleeps in the
                  cemetery of his fathers, but this is his monument. Long as this aged tree remains,
                  it will be sacred to the memory of Cleveland. Like that tree, now withered and
                  shorn of its summer glories, I too stand a memento of his fate; but the spring
                  will come to reclothe those naked branches, and pour the stream of vegetable life
                  in their veins; and I too await the coming of that spring-time, whose flowers and
                  verdue no after winter can blight." As I looked around me, the conviction that all
                  that I saw was associated with Aunt Mercy's youth; that here her aged grandmother
                  had lived, and she herself grown old; that here too I might grow old and die, was
                  very solemn. Aunt Mercy, who always seemed to read my thoughts, explained to me
                  all the changes which had gradually taken place. The inroads of time had been
                  constantly repaired, so that it was the same cottage in appearance that had
                  sheltered her in childhood. She had respected her grandmother's peculiar habits,
                  and continued them, perhaps, in many respects unconsciously. The white livery
                  which at first startled me from its singularity, but to which my eye had become
                  accustomed, had been adopted by her predecessor; when her failing sight found it
                  difficult to distinguish objects, and every thing darkened round her. "And I love
                  to look upon white," continued Aunt Mercy; "I love the winter's snow for its
                  whiteness. It reminds me of the blood-washed robes of the saints."</p>
               <p>I would have lingered near the spot hallowed by such deathless memories, but Aunt
                  Mercy drew me away. I trembled for the effect of such excitement on one so aged. I
                  thought her face looked paler than usual, and her step seemed less firm. I placed
                  the easy chair for her on our return, and stood by her with an anxious
                  countenance. "Fanny, my love," said she, pressing my hand in both hers, "I have
                  laid bare my heart before you, but the curtain must now fall over it—never again
                  to be lifted. I have done<pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC6687-00000230"/> with the
                  past—God and eternity must now claim all my thoughts!"</p>
               <p>Perhaps at some future hour, I may continue my own history, as it is connected
                  with my sister Laura's and the close of Aunt Mercy's life—a life continued beyond
                  the allotted period of existence.</p>

               <p>WHAT impels me to take up my pen, compose myself to the act of writing, and begin
                  the record of feelings and events which will inevitably throw a shadow over the
                  character which too partial and misjudging affection once beheld shining with
                  reflected lustre? I know not—but it seems to me, as if a divine voice whispered
                  from the boughs that wave by my window, occasionally intercepting the sun's rays
                  that now fall obliquely on my paper, saying that if I live for memory, I must not
                  live in vain—and that, perchance, when I, too, lie beneath the willow that hangs
                  over <emph>his</emph> grave, unconscious of its melancholy waving, a deep moral
                  may be found in these pages, short and simple as they may be. Then be it so. It is
                  humiliating to dwell on past errors—but I should rather welcome the humiliation,
                  if it can be any expiation for my blindness, my folly—no! such expressions are too
                  weak—I should say, my madness, my sin, my hard-hearted guilt.</p>
               <p>It is unnecessary to dwell on my juvenile years. Though dependent on the bounty of
                  an uncle, who had a large family of his own to support, every wish which vanity
                  could suggest, was indulged as soon as expressed. I never knew a kinder, more
                  hospitable, uncalculating being than my uncle. If his unsparing generosity had not
                  experienced a counteracting influence in the vigilant economy of my aunt, he
                     would<pb n="478-479" xml:id="VAC6687-00000231"/> long since have been a
                  bankrupt. She was never unkind to me; for I believe she was conscientious, and she
                  had loved my mother tenderly. I was the orphan legacy of that mother, and
                  consequently a sacred trust. I was fed and clothed like my wealthier cousins;
                  educated at the same schools; ushered into the same fashionable society, where I
                  learned that awkwardness was considered the only unpardonable offence, and that
                  almost any thing might be said and done, provided it was said and done gracefully.
                  From the time of our first introduction into what is called the world, I gradually
                  lost ground in the affections of my aunt, for I unfortunately eclipsed my elder
                  cousins in those outer gifts of nature and those acquired graces of manner, which,
                  however valueless when unaccompanied by inward worth, have always exercised a
                  prevailing, an irresistible influence in society. I never exactly knew why, but I
                  was the favourite of my uncle, who seemed to love me better than even his own
                  daughters, and he rejoiced at the admiration I excited, though often purchased at
                  their expense. Perhaps the secret was this. They were of a cold temperament; mine
                  was ardent, and whatever I loved, I loved without reserve, and expressed my
                  affection with characteristic warmth and enthusiasm. I loved my indulgent uncle
                  with all the fervour of which such a nature, made vain and selfish by education,
                  is capable. Often, after returning from an evening party, my heart throbbing high
                  with the delight of gratified vanity, when he would draw me toward shim and tell
                  me—with a most injudicious fondness, it is true—that I was a thousand times
                  prettier than the flowers I wore, more sparkling than the jewels, and that I ought
                  to marry a prince or a nabob, I exulted more in his praise than in the flatteries
                  that were still tingling in my ears. Even my aunt's coolness was a grateful
                  tribute to my self-love—for was it not occasioned by my transcendency over her
                  less gifted daughters?</p>
               <p>But why do I linger on the threshold of events, which, simple in themselves,
                  stamped my destiny—for time, yea, and for eternity?</p>
               <p>It was during a homeward journey, with my uncle, I first met him who afterwards
                  became my husband. My whole head becomes sick and my whole heart faint, as I think
                  what I might have been, and what I am. But I must forbear. If I am compelled at
                  times to lay aside my pen, overcome with agony and remorse, let me pause till I
                  can go on, with a steady hand, and a calmer brain.</p>
               <p>Our carriage broke down—it was a common accident—a young gentleman on horseback,
                  who seemed like ourselves, a traveller, came up to our assistance. He dismounted,
                  proffered every assistance in his power, and accompanied us to the inn, which
                  fortunately was not far distant, for my uncle was severely injured, and walked
                  with difficulty, though supported by the stranger's arm and my own. I cannot
                  define the feeling, but from the moment I beheld him, my spirit was troubled
                  within me. I saw, at once, that he was of a different order of beings from those I
                  had been accustomed to associate with; and there was something in the heavenly
                  composure of his countenance<pb n="480-481" xml:id="VAC6687-00000232"/> nance and
                  gentle dignity of manner, that rebuked my restless desire for admiration and love
                  of display. I never heard any earthly sound so sweet as his voice. Invisible
                  communion with angels could alone give such tones to the human voice. At first, I
                  felt a strange awe in his presence, and forgot those artificial graces, for which
                  I had been too much admired. Without meaning to play the part of a hypocrite, my
                  real disposition was completely concealed. During the three days we were detained,
                  he remained with us; and aloof from all temptation to folly, the best traits of my
                  character were called into exercise. On the morning of our departure, as my uncle
                  was expressing his gratitude for his kindness, and his hope of meeting him in
                  town, he answered—and it was not without emotion—"I fear our paths diverge too
                  much, to allow that hope. Mine is a lowly one, but I trust I shall find it blest."
                  I then, for the first time, learned that he was a minister—the humble pastor of a
                  country village. My heart died within me. That this graceful and uncommonly
                  interesting young man should be nothing more than an obscure village preacher—it
                  was too mortifying. All my bright visions of conquest faded away. "We can never be
                  any thing to each other," thought I. Yet as I again turned towards him, and saw
                  his usually calm eye fixed on me with an expression of deep anxiety, I felt the
                  conviction that I might be all the world to him. He was watching the effect of his
                  communication, and the glow of excited vanity that suffused my cheek was supposed
                  to have its origin from a purer source. I was determined to enjoy the full glory
                  of my conquest. When my uncle warmly urged him to accompany us home, and sojourn
                  with us a few days, I backed the invitation, with all the eloquence my countenance
                  was capable of expressing. Vain and selfish being that I was—I might have known
                  that we differed from each other as much as the rays of the morning star from the
                  artificial glare of the sky rocket. <emph>He</emph> drew his light from the
                  fountain of living glory, <emph>I</emph> from the decaying fires of earth.</p>
               <p>The invitation was accepted—and before that short visit was concluded, so great
                  was the influence he acquired over me, while <emph>I</emph> was only seeking to
                  gain the ascendency over <emph>his</emph> affections, that I felt willing to give
                  up the luxury and fashion that surrounded me, for the sweet and quiet hermitage he
                  described, provided the sacrifice were required. I never once thought of the
                  duties that would devolve upon me, the solemn responsibilities of my new
                  situation. It is one of the mysteries of Providence, how such a being as myself
                  could ever have won a heart like his. He saw the sunbeam playing on the surface,
                  and thought that all was fair beneath. I did love him; but my love was a passion,
                  not a principle. I was captivated by the heavenly graces of his manner, but was
                  incapable of comprehending the source whence those graces were derived.</p>
               <p>My uncle would gladly have seen me established in a style more congenial to my
                  prevailing tastes, but gave his consent, as he said, on the score of his
                  surpassing merit. My aunt was evidently more than<pb n="482-483"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000233"/> willing to have me married, while my cousins
                  rallied me for falling in love with a country parson.</p>
               <p>We were married. I accompanied him to the beautiful village of ——. I became
                  mistress of the parsonage. Never shall I forget the moment when I first entered
                  this avenue, shaded by majestic elms; beheld these low, white walls, festooned
                  with redolent vines; and heard the voice, which was then the music of my life,
                  welcome me here, as Heaven's best and loveliest gift. How happy—how blest I might
                  have been! and I <emph>was</emph> happy for awhile. His benign glance and
                  approving smile were, for a short time, an equivalent for the gaze of admiration
                  and strains of flattery to which I had been accustomed. I even tried, in some
                  measure, to conform to his habits and tastes, and to cultivate the good-will of
                  the plebeians and rustics who constituted a great portion of his parish. But the
                  mind, unsupported by principle, is incapable of any steady exertion. Mine
                  gradually wearied of the effort of assuming virtues, to which it had no legitimate
                  claim. The fervour of feeling which had given a bluer tint to the sky, and a
                  fairer hue to the flower, insensibly faded. I began to perceive defects in every
                  object, and to wonder at the blindness which formerly overlooked them. I still
                  loved my husband; but the longer I lived with him, the more his character soared
                  above the reach of mine. I could not comprehend how one could be endowed with such
                  brilliant talents and winning graces, and not wish for the admiration of the
                  world. I was vexed with him for his meekness and humility, and would gladly have
                  mingled, if I could, the base alloy of earthly ambition with his holy aspirations
                  after heaven. I was even jealous—I almost tremble while I write it—of the God he
                  worshipped. I could not bear the thought, that I held a second place in his
                  affections—though second only to the great and glorious Creator. Continually
                  called from my side to the chamber of the sick, the couch of the dying, the
                  dwelling of the poor and ignorant, I in vain sought to fill up the widening vacuum
                  left, by becoming interested in the duties of my station. I could not do it. They
                  became every day more irksome to me. The discontent I was cherishing, became more
                  and more visible, till the mild and anxious eye of my husband vainly looked for
                  the joyous smile that used to welcome his return.</p>
               <p>It is true, there were many things I was obliged to tolerate, which must
                  inevitably be distasteful to one educated with such false refinement as I have
                  been. But I never reflected they must be as opposed to my husband's tastes as my
                  own, and that Christian principle alone led him to the endurance of them. Instead
                  of appreciating his angelic patience and forbearance, I blamed him for not
                  lavishing more sympathy on me for trials which, though sometimes ludicrous in
                  themselves, are painful from the strength of association.</p>
               <p>The former minister of the village left a maiden sister as a kind of legacy to his
                  congregation. My husband had been a protege and pupil of the good man, who, on his
                  death-bed, bequeathed his people to the charge of this son of his adoption, and
                     <emph>him,</emph> with equal tenderness and solemnity, to the care of<pb
                     n="484-485" xml:id="VAC6687-00000234"/> his venerable sister. She became a
                  fixture in the parsonage, and to me a perpetual and increasing torment. The first
                  month of our marriage she was absent, visiting some of her seventh cousins in a
                  neighbouring town. I do not wish to exculpate myself from blame; but, if ever
                  there was a thorn in human flesh, I believe I had found it in this inquisitive,
                  gratuitously advising woman. I, who had always lived among roses, without thinking
                  of briers, was doomed to feel this thorn, daily, hourly, goading me; and was
                  constrained to conceal as much as possible the irritation she caused, because my
                  husband treated her with as much respect, as if she were an empress. I thought Mr.
                  L—— was wrong in this. Owing to the deep placidity of his own disposition, he
                  could not realize what a trial such a companion was to a mercurial, indulged,
                  self-willed being as myself. Nature has gifted me with an exquisite ear for music,
                  and a discord always "wakes the nerve where agony is born." Poor Aunt Debby had a
                  perfect mania for singing, and she would sit and sing for hours together,
                  oldfashioned ballads and hymns of surprising length—scarcely pausing to take
                  breath. I have heard aged people sing the songs of Zion, when there was most
                  touching melody in their tones; and some of the warmest feelings of devotion I
                  ever experienced, were awakened by these solemn, trembling notes. But Aunt Debby's
                  voice was full of indescribable ramifications, each a separate discord—a sharp,
                  sour voice, indicative of the natural temper of the owner. One Sunday morning,
                  after she had been screeching one of Dr. Watts' hymns, of about a hundred verses,
                  she left me to prepare for church. When we met, after finishing our separate
                  toilettes, she began her animadversions on my dress, as being too gay for a
                  minister's wife. I denied the charge; for though made in the redundance of
                  fashion, it was of unadorned white.</p>
               <p>"But what," said she, disfiguring the muslin folds with her awkward fingers, "what
                  is the use of all these fandangles of lace? They are nothing but Satan's devices
                  to lead astray silly women, whose minds are running after finery." All this I
                  might have borne with silent contempt, for it came from Aunt Debby; but when she
                  brought the authority of a Mrs. Deacon and a Mrs. Doelan of the parish, to prove
                  that she was not the only one who found fault with the fashion of my attire, the
                  indignant spirit broke its bounds; deference for age was forgotten in the
                  excitement of the moment, and the concentrated irritation of weeks burst forth. I
                  called her an impertinent, morose old maid, and declared that one or the other of
                  us should leave the parsonage. In the midst of the paroxysm my husband entered—the
                  calm of heaven on his brow. He had just left his closet, where he had been to seek
                  the divine manna for the pilgrims it was his task to guide through the wilderness
                  of life. He looked from one to the other, in grief and amazement. Aunt Debby had
                  seated herself on his entrance, and began to rock herself backward and forward,
                  and to sigh and groan—saying it was a hard thing to be called such hard names at
                  her time of life, &amp;c. I stood, my cheeks<pb n="486-487"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000235"/> glowing with anger, and my heart violently
                  palpitating with the sudden effort at self-control. He approached me, took my
                  hand, and said, "My dear Mary!" There was affection in his tone, but there was
                  upbraiding, also; and drawing away my hand, I wept in bitterness of spirit. As
                  soon as I could summon sufficient steadiness of voice, I told him the cause of my
                  resentment, and declared, that I would never again enter a place, where I was
                  exposed to ridicule and censure, and from those, too, so immeasurably my inferiors
                  in birth and education. "Dearest Mary!" exclaimed he, turning pale from agitation,
                  "you cannot mean what you say. Let not such trifles as these, mar the peace of
                  this holy day. I grieve that your feelings should have been wounded; but what
                  matters it what the world says of our outward apparel, if our souls are clothed
                  with those robes of holiness, which make us lovely in our Maker's eyes? Let us go
                  together to the temple of Him, whose last legacy to man was
                  <emph>peace.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Though the bell was ringing its last notes, and though I saw him so painfully
                  disturbed, I still resisted the appeal, and repeated my rash asseveration. The
                  bell had pealed its latest summons, and was no longer heard. "Mary, must I go
                  alone?" His hand was on the latch—there was a burning flush on his cheek, such as
                  I had never seen before. My pride would have yielded—my conscience convicted me of
                  wrong—I would have acknowledged my rashness, had not Aunt Debby, whom I thought
                  born to be my evil spirit, risen with a long-drawn sigh, and taken his arm
                  preparatory to accompanying him. "No," said I, "you will not be alone. You need
                  not wait for me. In Aunt Debby's company, you cannot regret mine."</p>
               <p>Surely my heart must have been steeled, like Pharaoh's, for some divine purpose,
                  or I never could have resisted the mute anguish of his glance, as he closed the
                  door on this cold and unmerited taunt. What hours of wretchedness I passed in the
                  solitude of my chamber! I magnified my sufferings into those of martyrdom, and
                  accused Mr. L—— of not preparing me for the trials of my new situation. Yet, even
                  while I reproached him in my heart, I was conscious of my injustice, and felt that
                  I did not suffer alone. It was the first time any other than words of love and
                  kindness had passed between us, and it seemed to me, that a barrier was beginning
                  to rise, that would separate us forever. When we again met, I tried to retain the
                  same cold manner and averted countenance, but he came unaccompanied by my
                  tormentor, and looked so dejected and pale, my petulance and pride yielded to the
                  reign of better feelings. I had even the grace to make concessions, which were
                  received with such gratitude and feeling, I was melted into goodness, transient
                  but sincere. Had Aunt Debby remained from us, all might yet have been well; but
                  after having visited awhile among the parish, she returned; and her presence
                  choked the blossoms of my good resolutions. I thought she never forgave the
                  offending epithet I had given her in the moment of passion. It is far from my
                  intention, in delineating peculiarities like<pb n="488-489"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000236"/> hers, to throw any opprobrium on that class of
                  females who, from their isolated and often unprotected situation, are peculiarly
                  susceptible to the shafts of unkindness or ridicule. I have known those, whose
                  influence seemed as diffusive as the sunshine and gentle as the dew; at whose
                  approach the ringlets of childhood would be tossed gaily back, and the wan cheek
                  of the aged lighted up with joy; who had devoted the glow of their youth, and the
                  strength of their prime, to acts of filial piety and love, watching the waning
                  fires of life, as the vestal virgins the flame of the altar. Round such beings as
                  these the beatitudes cluster; and yet, the ban of unfeeling levity is passed upon
                  the maiden sisterhood. But I wander from my path. It is not <emph>her</emph>
                  history I am writing, so much as my own; which, however deficient in incident, is
                  not without its moral power.</p>
               <p>I experienced one source of mortification, which I have not yet mentioned; it may
                  even seem too insignificant to be noticed, and yet it was terribly grating to my
                  aristocratic feelings. Some of our good parishioners were in the habit of
                  lavishing attentions so repugnant to me, that I did not hesitate to refuse them;
                  which I afterwards learned gave great mortification and displeasure. I would
                  willingly accept a basket of fragrant strawberries, or any of the elegant bounties
                  of nature; but when they offered such plebeian gifts as a shoulder of pork or
                  mutton, a sack of grain or potatoes, <emph>I</emph> invariably returned my cold
                  thanks and declined the honour. Is it strange that I should become to them an
                  object of aversion, and that they should draw comparisons, humbling to me, between
                  their idolized minister and his haughty bride?</p>
               <p>My uncle and cousins made me a visit, not long after my rupture with Aunt Debby,
                  which only served to render me more unhappy. My uncle complained so much of my
                  altered appearance, my faded bloom and languid spirits, I saw that it gave
                  exquisite pain to Mr. L——, while my cousins, now in their day of power, amused
                  themselves continually with the oldfashioned walls of the house, the obsolete
                  style of the furniture, and my humdrum mode of existence. Had I possessed one
                  spark of heavenly fire, I should have resented all this as an insult to him whom I
                  had solemnly vowed to love and honour. These oldfashioned walls should have been
                  sacred in my eyes. They were twice hallowed—hallowed by the recollections of
                  departed excellence and the presence of living holiness. Every leaf of the
                  magnificent elms that overshadowed them, should have been held sacred, for the
                  breath of morning and evening prayer had been daily wafted over them, up to the
                  mercy-seat of heaven.</p>
               <p>I returned with my uncle to the metropolis. It is true, he protested that he would
                  not, could not leave me behind—and that change of scene was absolutely necessary
                  to the restoration of my bloom, and Mr. L—— gave his assent with apparent
                  cheerfulness and composure. But I knew—I felt, that his heart bled at my
                  willingness, my wish to be absent from him, so soon after our marriage. He told me
                  to consult my<pb n="490-491" xml:id="VAC6687-00000237"/> own happiness, in the
                  length of my visit, and that he would endeavour to find a joy in solitude, in
                  thinking of mine. "Oh!" said one of my cousins, with a loud laugh, "you can never
                  feel solitary, where Aunt Debby is——"</p>
               <p>Behold me once more 'mid the scenes congenial to my soul—a gay flower, sporting
                  over the waves of fashion, thoughtless of the caverns of death beneath. Again the
                  voice of flattery fell meltingly on my ear; and while listening to the siren, I
                  forgot those mild, admonishing accents, which were always breathing of heaven—or
                  if I remembered them at all, they came to my memory like the grave rebuke of
                  Milton's cherub—severe in their beauty. Yes, I did remember them when I was alone;
                  and there are hours when the gayest will feel desolately alone. I thought of him
                  in his neglected home; him, from whom I was gradually alienating myself for his
                  very perfections, and accusing conscience avenged his rights. Oh! how miserable,
                  how poor we are, when unsupported by our own esteem! when we fear to commune with
                  our own hearts, and doubly tremble to bare them to the all-seeing eye of our
                  Maker! My husband often wrote me most affectionately. He did not urge my return,
                  but said, whenever I felt willing to exchange the pleasures of the metropolis for
                  the seclusion of the hermitage, his arms and his heart were open to receive me. At
                  length I received a letter, which touched those chords that yet vibrated to the
                  tones of nature and feeling. He seldom spoke of himself—but in this, he mentioned
                  having been very ill, though then convalescent. "Your presence, my Mary," said he,
                  "would bring healing on its wings. I fear, greatly fear, I have doomed you to
                  unhappiness, by rashly yielding to the influence of your beauty and winning
                  manners, taking advantage of your simplicity and inexperience, without reflecting
                  how unfitted you were, from natural disposition and early habits, to be a
                  fellow-labourer in so humble a portion of our Master's vineyard. Think not, my
                  beloved wife, I say this in reproach. No! 'tis in sorrow, in repentance, in
                  humiliation of spirit. I have been too selfish. I have not shown sufficient
                  sympathy for the trials and vexations to which, for me, you have been exposed. I
                  have asked to receive too much. I have given back too little. Return then, my
                  Mary; you were created for nobler purposes than the beings who surround you. Let
                  us begin life anew. Let us take each other by the hand as companions for time—but
                  pilgrims for eternity. Be it mine to guard, guide and sustain—yours, to console,
                  to gild and comfort." In a postscript he added:</p>
               <p>"I am better now—a journey will restore me. I will soon be with you, when I trust
                  we will not again be parted."</p>
               <p>My heart was not of rock. It was moved—melted. I should have been less than human,
                  to have been untouched by a letter like this. All my romantic love, but so
                  recently chilled, returned; and I thought of his image as that of an angel's. Ever
                  impulsive, ever actuated by the passion of the moment, I made the most fervent
                  resolutions of amendment, and panted<pb n="492-493" xml:id="VAC6687-00000238"/>
                  for the hour when we should start for, together, this immortal goal! Alas! how
                  wavering were my purposes—how ineffective my holy resolutions!</p>
               <p>There was a numerous congregation gathered on the Sabbath morn, not in the simple
                  village church, but the vaulted walls of a city dome. A stranger ascended the
                  pulpit. Every eye was turned on him and none wandered. He was pallid, as from
                  recent indisposition; but there was a flitting glow on his cheek, the herald of
                  coming inspiration. There was a divine simplicity, a sublime fervour, an
                  abandonment of self, a lifting up of the soul to heaven, an indescribable and
                  spiritual charm pervading his manner, that was acknowledged by the breathless
                  attention of a crowded audience, composed of the wealth and fashion of the
                  metropolis. And I was there, the proudest, the happiest of the throng. That gifted
                  being was my husband. I was indemnified for all past mortifications, and looked
                  forward to bright years of felicity, not in the narrow path we had heretofore
                  travelled, but a wider, more brilliant sphere. My imagination placed him at the
                  head of that admiring congregation; and I saw the lowly flock he had been lately
                  feeding, weeping, unpitied, between the porch and the altar.</p>
               <p>Before we bade farewell to my uncle, I had abundant reason to believe my vision
                  would soon be realized. The church was then without a pastor. No candidate had as
                  yet appeared in whom their opinions or affections were united. They were
                  enthusiastic in their admiration of Mr. L——, and protested against the obscurity
                  of his location. With such hopes gilding the future, I left the metropolis with a
                  cheerfulness and elasticity of spirits, which my husband hailed as a surety for
                  long years of domestic felicity. I would gladly linger here awhile. I fear to go
                  on. You have followed me so far with a kind of complaisant interest, as a poor,
                  vain, weak young creature, whose native defects have been enhanced by education,
                  and who has unfortunately been placed in a sphere she is incapable of adorning.
                  The atmosphere is too pure, too rarified. Removed at once from the valley of sin
                  to the mount of holiness, I breathe with difficulty the celestial air, and pant
                  for more congenial reagions. Must I proceed? Your compassion will turn to
                  detestation: yet I cannot withdraw from the task I have imposed on myself. It is
                  an expiatory one; and oh, may it be received as such!</p>
               <p>It was scarcely more than a week after our return. All had been peace and
                  sunshine: so resolved was I to be all that was lovely and amiable. I even listened
                  with apparent patience to Aunt Debby's interminable hymns, and heard some of her
                  long stories, the seventy-seventh time, without any manifest symptom of vexation.
                  It was about sunset. We sat together in the study, my husband and myself, watching
                  the clouds as they softly rolled towards the sinking sun, to dip their edges in
                  his golden beams. The boughs of the elms waved across the window, giving us
                  glimpses of the beautiful vale beyond, bounded by the blue outline of the distant
                  hills. Whether it was the warm light reflected on his face, or the glow of<pb
                     n="494-495" xml:id="VAC6687-00000239"/> the heart suffusing it, I know not; but
                  I never saw his usually pale features more radiantly lighted up than at that
                  moment. A letter was brought to him. I leaned over his shoulder while he opened
                  it. From the first line I understood its import: it was the realization of my
                  hopes. The offer was there made—more splendid, more liberal than I had dared to
                  anticipate. I did not speak: but with cheeks burning and hands trembling with
                  eagerness and joy, I waited till he had perused it. He still continued silent.
                  Almost indignant at his calmness, I ejaculated his name in an impatient tone; when
                  he raised his eyes from the paper and fixed them on me. I read there the
                  death-blow of my hopes. They emitted no glance of triumph: there was sorrow,
                  regret, humility, and love—but I looked in vain for more. "I am sorry for this,"
                  said he, "for your sake, my dear Mary. It may excite wishes which can never be
                  realized. No! let us be happy in the lowlier sphere, in which an all-wise Being
                  has marked my course. I cannot deviate from it." "Cannot!" repeated I: "say,
                  rather, you will not." I could not articulate more. The possibility of a refusal
                  on his part had never occurred to me. I was thunderstruck. He saw my emotion—and,
                  losing all his composure, rose and crushed the letter in his hand. "I could not if
                  I would, accept this," he cried; "and, were my own wishes to be alone consulted, I
                  would not, were I free to act. But it is not so. I am bound to this place, by a
                  solemn promise, which cannot be broken. Here, in this very house, it was made, by
                  the dying bed of the righteous, who bequeathed the people he loved to
                     <emph>my</emph> charge—<emph>me,</emph> the orphan he had protected and reared.
                  'Never leave them, my son,' said the expiring saint—'never leave the lambs of my
                  flock to be scattered on the mountains.' I pledged my word, surrounded by the
                  solemnities of death: yea, even while his soul was taking its upward flight. It is
                  recorded, and cannot be recalled."</p>
               <p>Did I feel the sacredness of the obligation he revealed? Did I venerate the
                  sanctity of his motives, and admit their authority? No! Totally unprepared for
                  such a bitter disappointment, when I seemed touching the summit of all my wishes,
                  I was maddened—reckless. I upbraided him for having more regard to a dead
                  guardian, who could no longer be affected by his decision, than for a living wife.
                  I threatened to leave him to the obscurity in which he was born, and return to the
                  friends who loved me so much better than himself. Seeing him turn deadly pale at
                  this, and suddenly put his hand on his heart, I thought I had discovered the
                  spring to move his resolution, and determined that I would not let it go. I moved
                  towards the door, thinking it best to leave him a short time to his own
                  reflections, assured that love must be victorious over conscience. He made a
                  motion as if to detain me, as I passed—then again pressed his hand on his heart.
                  That silent motion—never, never can I forget it!</p>
               <p>"Are you resolved on this?" asked he, in a low, very hoarse tone of voice. "Yes,
                  if you persist in your refusal. I leave you to decide." I went into<pb n="496-497"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000240"/> the next room. I heard him walk a few moments, as
                  if agitated and irresolute—then suddenly stop. I then heard a low, suppressed
                  cough, but to this he was always subject, when excited, and it caused no emotion.
                  Yet, after remaining alone for some time, I began to be alarmed at the perfect
                  stillness. A strange feeling of horror came over me. I remembered the deadly
                  paleness of his countenance, and the cold dew gathered fast and thick on my brow.
                  I recollected, too, that he had told me of once having bled at the lungs, and of
                  being admonished to shun every predisposing cause to such a malady. Strange, that
                  after such an entire oblivion of every thing but self, these reflections should
                  have pressed upon me with such power, at that moment. I seemed suddenly gifted
                  with second sight, and feared to move, lest I should see the vision of my
                  conscience embodied. At length, Aunt Debby opened the door, and for the first time
                  rejoicing in her sight, <emph>I</emph> entreated her to go into the library, with
                  an earnestness that appalled her. She did go—and her first sharp scream drew me to
                  her side. There, reclined upon the sofa, motionless, lifeless—his face white as a
                  snow-drift, lay my husband; his neckcloth and vest saturated with the blood that
                  still flowed from his lips. Yes, he lay there—lifeless, dead, dead! The wild
                  shriek of agony and remorse pierced not his unconscious ear. He was dead, and
                     <emph>I</emph> was his murderer. The physician who was summoned, pronounced my
                  doom. From violent agitation of mind, a blood vessel had been broken, and instant
                  death had ensued. Weeks of frenzy, months of despair, succeeded—of black despair.
                  Nothing but an almighty arm thrown around my naked soul, held me back from the
                  brink of suicide. Could I have believed in annihilation—and I wrestled with the
                  powers of reason to convince myself that in the grave, at least, I should find
                  rest. I prayed but for rest—I prayed for oblivion. Night and day the image of that
                  bleeding corse was before me. Night and day a voice was ringing in my ears,
                     "<emph>Thou hast murdered him!</emph>" My sufferings were so fearful to
                  witness, the at first compassionate neighbours deserted my pillow, justifying
                  themselves by the conviction that I merited all that I endured.</p>
               <p>My uncle and aunt came when they first heard the awful tidings, but unable to
                  support my raving distress, left me—after providing every thing for my
                  comfort—with the injunction that as soon as I should be able to be removed, to be
                  carried to their household. And whose kind, unwearied hand smoothed my lonely
                  pillow, and held my aching brow? Who, when wounded reason resumed her empire,
                  applied the balm of Gilead and the oil of tenderness; led me to the feet of the
                  divine Physician, prayed with me and for me, wept with me and over me, nor rested
                  till she saw me clinging to the cross, in lowliness of spirit, with the seal of
                  the children of God in my forehead, and the joy of salvation in my soul? It was
                  Aunt Debby. The harsh condemner of the fashions of this world, the stern reprover
                  of vanity and pride, the uncompromising defender of godliness and truth; she who
                  in my day of prosperity was the cloud, in the night of sorrow was my light and
                  consolation. The<pb n="498-499" xml:id="VAC6687-00000241"/> rough bark was
                  penetrated and the finer wood beneath gave forth its fragrance. Oh! how often, as
                  I have heard her, seated by my bedside, explaining in a voice softened by
                  kindness, the mysteries of holiness, and repeating the promises of mercy, have I
                  wondered, that I, who had turned a deaf ear to the same truths, when urged upon me
                  with all an angel's eloquence, should listen with reverence to accents from which
                  I had heretofore turned in disgust! Yet at times, there seemed a dignity in her
                  tones; her harsh features would light up with an expression of devout ecstasy, and
                  I marvelled at the transforming power of Christianity. Well may I marvel! I would
                  not now, for the diadem of the east, exchange this sequestered hermitage for the
                  halls of fashion—these hallowed shades for the canopies of wealth—or the society
                  of the once despised and hated. Aunt Debby, for the companionship of flatterers. I
                  see nothing but thorns where once roses blushed. The voice of the charmer has lost
                  its power, though "it charm never so wisely." My heart lies buried in the tomb on
                  which the sunlight now solemnly glimmers—my hopes are fixed on those regions from
                  whence those rays depart. Had he only lived to forgive me—to know my penitence and
                  agony—but the last words that ever fell on his ear from my lips, were those of
                  passion and rebellion—the last glance I ever cast on him, was proud and up
                  braiding.</p>
               <p>The sketch is finished—memory overpowers me.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Thanksgiving Day.</head>
               <p>I WAS travelling merrily along, in a snug, green sleigh, wrapped in buffalo skins,
                  rejoicing in the prospect of a comfortable night's rest, in the still village
                  which I saw peeping over the hill I was just ascending. It was a clear, cold,
                  bracing winter's day. The ground was covered with spotless, shining snow, that
                  made the eyes ache from its intense whiteness, and the air had those little,
                  bright, cutting particles of frost, that glance like a razor across the nose and
                  chin.</p>
               <p>"How charmingly I shall sleep to-night," said I to myself, nodding in fancy at the
                  very thought, "when I reach that hospitable looking inn, whose sign-post creaks so
                  invitingly in the wind! How refreshing a hot cup of coffee, and light, smoking
                  muffins will taste, after riding so far in the sharp, hungry air!" Regaling myself
                  with this vision of anticipated comfort, I suffered the reins to hang a little too
                  loosely: my horse, who was probably indulging in <emph>his</emph> reveries of
                  oats, and hay, and a warm crib, made a kind of off-hand, sliding step, and with a
                  most involuntary jump, I vaulted at once into a bed of a very different nature
                  from the one upon which my imagination was dwelling. It was some time before I
                  recovered from the stunning effects of my extemporaneous agility; but when I rose
                  and shook off the snow-flakes from my great-coat, I heard the sound of my horse's
                     bells<pb n="500-501" xml:id="VAC6687-00000242"/> at a respectable distance; and
                  I had to walk speedily, and limpingly too, to the next tavern, before whose door I
                  intended to have made such a triumphant flourish. There, I arrived at the
                  mortifying conviction, that my sleigh was broken, that my horse had run, head
                  first, against the shaft of another sleigh, and wounded himself in such a manner,
                  that I should probably be detained several days on my journey. I felt quite stiff
                  and lame the next day, but my landlady—who was a good little bustling woman,
                  walking about so briskly that the border of her cap flew back and lay flat on her
                  head as she moved—gave me so many warm lotions and doses, that towards evening, I
                  felt as if I had recovered my wonted activity. She advised me not to leave the
                  room that day, "as it would be a thousand pities, if I cotched cold, after such a
                  marciful deliverance." The scene from abroad was too tempting, however, for my
                  philosophy. They may rave about the beauties of a moonlight night in summer—a
                  night of shadows, bloom and flowers; singing birds and singing rills—but it cannot
                  be compared to the one I then gazed upon—it was so dazzlingly bright!—the virgin
                  snow looked so calm and holy in the clear light that mantled it. The first idea it
                  suggested was a solemn one. It lay so cold and still, it reminded me of the
                  winding-sheet of nature, till the almost supernatural radiance that sparkled from
                  its surface, recalled to the imagination those spotless robes of glory, which are
                  described as the future garments of the righteous. I stood with my arms
                  meditatingly folded, absorbed in these reflections tions, till the stars twinkled
                  so kindly, with such sweet, beckoning lustre, I could not resist the temptation of
                  going abroad. I rambled awhile down the street, when, catching the echo of a gay
                  laugh, and an occasional jovial shout, on the cold, still air, I turned in the
                  direction of the sound, and soon found myself near a boisterous, busy little
                  group, who were engaged in the delightful amusement of sliding down hill. I did
                  not wish to disturb their gaiety, and stopping in the shade of a high stone wall,
                  close to the spot, watched them as they stood on the brow of the slope, preparing
                  to make the grand descent. There were girls and boys, without hats, or bonnets, or
                  cloaks—their cheeks looking so rosy, and their eyes so bright, it made your own
                  wink to look at them. About half a dozen little girls were wedged closely together
                  on a hand-sled, the handle of which was turned back and held by one who sat in the
                  middle, in the capacity of charioteersman, and one who sat on the right hand, held
                  a stick, which she occasionally stuck in the snow to pilot them on their way.
                  There was one girl taller and larger than the rest, who seemed to take a kind of
                  superintendence of the band. I never saw such a personification of health, bloom,
                  and rustic beauty. Her hair, which was perfectly black, hung about her shoulders,
                  as if she had just shaken out a confining comb; her face was lighted up with such
                  a living glow of animation, it made one feel a sensation of warmth and comfort to
                  gaze on her; and then her blithe voice rang so musically on the ear, it gave the
                  heart a quicker, gladder<pb n="502-503" xml:id="VAC6687-00000243"/> bound to hear
                  it. Just as they were about to start on their downward career, there came a dismal
                  screeching from a neighbouring farm yard, that jarred most discordantly with the
                  merriment of the scene. "Oh!" said one of the little girls, in a doleful tone,
                  "the poor hens and chickens! What a dreadful, cruel thing it is to kill 'em so for
                  Thanksgiving—just too, as they get nicely to roosting! I won't touch a bit of
                  chicken-pie to-morrow—you see if I do." "Do you hear her!" started half a dozen at
                  once; "she sha'n't have any Thanksgiving, shall she? And don't you pity the
                  pumpkins, and the apples, and cranberries, Mary? And don't you think it hurts them
                  to be cut, and pared, and stemmed!" Here the voices were drowned in peals of
                  superior laughter. "Never mind, little Mary," interrupted the kind, glad accents
                  of the elder girl—"I love you all the better for being pitiful, and so they all
                  do, if they do laugh at you." I gathered from this childish, but moral discourse,
                  that the next day was to be Thanksgiving—that good, old-fashioned New England
                  festival, and was exceedingly pleased at the idea of witnessing the hilarity of
                  the village on so interesting an anniversary. I recollected that I had seen, or
                  rather heard, most marvellous preparations going on at the inn, pounding, and
                  stirring, and rolling, and beating, and chopping, and various other mysterious
                  sounds.</p>
               <p>Now, off they go—faster and faster—the little sled glides like a fairy boat over a
                  moonlit wave: now it shoots like a falling star near the foot of the hill. A shout
                  from above—but, alas! a cry of distress from below! The triumphal vehicle was
                  overturned, and the compassionate little Mary taken up writhing with pain. "Poor,
                  dear Mary!" exclaimed the pretty, black-eyed lassie, bending anxiously over her;
                  "what is the matter?" "Oh, I don't know," answered the poor child; "but it hurts
                     <emph>so</emph> bad!" Grieved at the accident that had checked their innocent
                  glee, I immediately offered my services to carry the little sufferer wherever they
                  should direct, an offer which was accepted with readiness and gratitude. Fearing
                  she had broken a limb. I bore her with great tenderness and care to her father's
                  house, which was indicated by her elder sister, the pretty girl I admired so much.
                  It is unnecessary to dwell on the commotion of the family, upon the sudden
                  entrance of a stranger under such circumstances. Every body knows what a bustle
                  is. Let those who love such scenes, seek for a description elsewhere. I wish to
                  say a few words of the good doctor of the village, who speedily arrived—a man,
                  who, "take him all in all, we ne'er shall look upon his like again." He was
                  dressed in a long, white, tight-bodied great-coat—a broad-brimmed white hat, with
                  a pair of huge saddlebags on his left arm, and a pair of huge spectacles
                  approaching the extremity of a long, thin nose. He walked directly towards the
                  table, without looking to the right or left; took off his hat, laid down his
                  saddlebags, hemmed—then walked straight to the fire, sat down, and looked wisely
                  into it, with his long hands resting on his knees. "Oh, doctor!" said the anxious
                  mother, "do look at the poor child, and see what is the matter<pb n="504-505"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000244"/> ter." "I'll pass my judgment directly," said he,
                  weighing his words as he uttered them. At last, after a great many preliminaries,
                  he "passed his judgment," that the child had dislocated her collar-bone—set it
                  with greater expedition than I expected, resumed his saddlebags and hat, and
                  walked directly out of the house, without looking to the right or left. Surely, if
                  ever mortal man pursued a steady, undeviating course in the line of duty, it was
                  Doctor M. And never was mortal man more venerated for wisdom and skill. It was
                  almost believed he held the issues of life and death in his hands, and his
                  "judgments" were never disputed. It is strange there are so many inveterate
                  talkers in the world, when a few words, slowly uttered, invariably establish a
                  reputation for superior sagacity. Let me do justice to the good doctor before I
                  leave him. They said, when once you penetrated the hard, cocoa-nut shell of his
                  manners, you met the sweet flow of the milk of <emph>human kindness,</emph> warm
                  from the best of human hearts.</p>
               <p>The family were so grateful for my attention, that they invited me to come and
                  partake of a Thanksgiving dinner with them—an invitation I gladly accepted,
                  especially as Lucy, my black-eyed favourite, was the elder daughter of the
                  household, and backed the request with a glance, that flashed as brightly over me
                  as the pine-knot blaze that was glowing in the chimney.</p>
               <p>Thanksgiving morning dawned—clear, dazzling, and cold. The sun came forth like a
                  bridegroom from the east, unconscious of the slaughtered victims, whose heads lay
                  reeking in the poultry-yard, unconscious of his unpitying beams. Thanksgiving day!
                  What "volumes of meaning" in that little phrase! A day when man makes a covenant
                  of gratitude with his Maker for the free bounties of the year; when the fragrant
                  incense of the heart rises up warm and fresh, above earth's cold, wintry mantle,
                  sweeter than the aroma of summer flowers, and mingles with the odours of Paradise!
                  I went that morning to the village church—a plain, modest building, distinguished
                  by a tall, white spire, that arrested the first and last glances of the
                  magnificent eye of the universe. The village pastor—what endearing associations
                  cluster around that name!—stood in the act of prayer, as I entered: I caught the
                  sound of his voice, and it filled me with venerating sensations. It had that deep,
                  full, organ sound, which breathes so eloquently of soul; and as it rose with the
                  fervour of his feelings, and rolled through the arch of the simple, but
                  heaven-dedicated walls, I felt my spirit as irresistibly borne along on these
                  waves of sound, towards the ocean of eternity, as the fallen leaf upon the billowy
                  sea. I never heard such a voice in my life. "How," thought I, gazing in wonder on
                  his evangelical face, pale, but illumined with the glow of devotion,—"how came
                  such a man here?" Towards the close of the prayer, the deep, majestic tones of
                  adoration and praise gradually lowered to the softer accents of humility and love.
                  He sat down; there was a hush, as if the Spirit of God had descended and was
                  brooding over the abysses of the human heart. I wish I were not limited to a<pb
                     n="506-507" xml:id="VAC6687-00000245"/> sketch, that I might dwell long on this
                  meek, richly-gifted apostle of our divine religion. Never before had Christianity
                  seemed to me so lovely and august. His sermon was the most eloquent I ever
                  heard—fraught with glowing images, with earnest, affecting, and energetic
                  exhortations. I felt as if I had been a monster of ingratitude, and I made a vow
                  to myself, to live hereafter a wiser and a better man. I fear you will think I did
                  not fulfil my vow, when I passed the succeeding scenes. Yes, I must descend from
                  the holy mount of prayer and praise, to the simple, heartfelt socialities of a
                  village life. Imagine me, then, seated at a long table, covered with spotless
                  linen, and groaning with unutterable comforts, and around that table three
                  generations gathered. "First the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the
                  ear." There sat the grandfather and grandmother, their brows whitened with the
                  harvest of life, ready to be gathered into the heavenly garner: then the
                  respectable farmer and matron, the heads of the household, in the quietude of
                  conscious competency and domestic happiness; then the children, from my pretty
                  Lucy, down to a little chubby, golden-haired, blue-eyed thing that peeped from her
                  grandfather's knee, like a violet from a snow-bank. The old man raised his feeble
                  hand, and every head was bowed, as, with a palsied, difficult voice, he called
                  down a blessing on the bounteous board. Even the infant on his knee clasped its
                  little hands, and looked reverently in its grandfather's face, as if it were
                  conscious it had something to do with heaven. After a decent pause, the business
                  of gratitude tude commenced. The roasted turkey—the lord of the table; the
                  chickens, roast beef, chicken pie, with its circumvolutions of paste, salient
                  angles, and loop-holes, were first to be demolished, with the accompanying
                  vegetables and relishes, the bright green pickles, garnished with the scarlet
                  barberries. Then came the plum puddings, and mince pies, and apples, and custard,
                  and cranberry-tarts; and pumpkin pudding, and apple custard: and it would have
                  been considered the height of ingratitude to have refused one of these dainties. A
                  triangular piece of each pie was put upon a plate, till they made a perfect wheel
                  of party-coloured spokes. Lucy sat by my side and received my gallant compliments,
                  with a mingled bashfulness and roguery of expression, which was completely
                  bewitching to me. I was what they called a genteel, good-looking young man, and
                  had a tolerably good opinion of my own powers of pleasing. I thought there could
                  be no possible harm in flirting a little with the pretty rustic. I was incited to
                  this by the evident discomposure of a youth, who sat on the opposite side of the
                  table, whose countenance presented the oddest mixture of displeasure, fear, and
                  shame-facedness I ever witnessed. He had really a fine face, but it was so
                  disguised by these different expressions, it had something inexpressibly ludicrous
                  in it. He sat at a distance from the table, with his feet on the rounds of the
                  chair, so that he was obliged to reach forward his head and arms most
                  lengtheningly; and he kept his eyes fixed so ruefully, yet indignantly on Lucy and
                  myself, that he could<pb n="508-509" xml:id="VAC6687-00000246"/> not find the
                  right path from his plate to his mouth. Lucy seemed saucily to enjoy his
                  awkwardness and confusion, and, true to her sex, triumphed in her power. At last,
                  seeing that he had laid down his knife and fork, over his untouched pie, she asked
                  with real interest and kindness of tone,</p>
               <p>"William, why don't you eat? I am afraid you are sick."</p>
               <p>"I haven't got any appetite," said he, huskily.</p>
               <p>"You've lost it very suddenly," said she, archly.</p>
               <p>At this, he cast at me a glance of dim fierceness, so irresistibly comical, I had
                  recourse to a convenient fit of coughing, to hide the rising laugh. Lucy caught
                  the infection, and unable to resist the impulse, laughed outright. The poor fellow
                  started on his feet, set back his chair, with a tremendous noise, snatched up his
                  hat, and marched directly out of the room.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lucy, what have you done!" said her mother reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"Lucy, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!" uttered her rougher father.</p>
               <p>I looked at Lucy. Her face was the colour of crimson, and an expression of alarm
                  struggled with her scarcely conquered mirth. I began to think I had carried
                  matters a little too far, and that Lucy was rather too much of a coquette. I was
                  sorry for the pain I had given his honest heart, and for the confusion into which
                  I had thrown the good people. She was evidently ashamed of having me suppose that
                  he had any right to be displeased, and put up her pretty lip, and said she was
                  sure she did not care: "he was nothing to her—he had no business to look so
                  funny." My thoughts were diverted into a new channel, by a side conversation which
                  was going on by the couch of little Mary, (which was nicely made up in a corner of
                  the room, within full view of the dainties of the day,) between her and a cousin
                  of the same age, upon the comparative merits of the different pies their mothers
                  had made, their superior quality and quantity. At last the dispute became very
                  warm—their tones grew angry, and every little sentence began with "I say."</p>
               <p>What a lesson might the proud wrestlers in the great arena of life take from these
                  Lilliputian disputants! They rested their claims to superiority upon the majority
                  of pies made in their households, and each pie, in their eyes, was of more value
                  and importance than the star of the legion of honour. It may seem a trifling
                  theme; but many a time since that hour, when I have heard the high and mighty, in
                  mind and name, contend for the poor straws of earthly distinction, I have thought
                  of the eager, positive, triumphant assertion, "<emph>my mother made the most
                     pies.</emph>"</p>
               <p>To return to my rustic coquette. As evening approached, her vivacity was rather
                  upon the wane: she cast restless glances towards the door: at the sound of the
                  merry, jingling bells she ran to the windows, and looked earnestly out, as if
                  looking for something, whose coming she watched in vain. "He won't come, Lucy,"
                  whispered her sister to her. "I don't believe he will ever come near you again.
                  You can't go to<pb n="510-511" xml:id="VAC6687-00000247"/> the ball." "I don't
                  care," answered Lucy; but as she turned away, I saw tears gathering in her bright
                  eyes, which belied the indifference of her words. I understood at once the state
                  of the case. This awkward youth was probably a sweetheart of hers, who, when free
                  from the demon spell of jealousy, was very likely a glass of fashion to the
                  village dandies. There was to be a Thanksgiving ball, and he was to have been her
                  partner. In a paroxysm of jealousy he had left her in the lurch; and the prettiest
                  lassie in the country was doomed to the penalty of staying at home, because she
                  could not get her beau!</p>
               <p>This would never do. As I had been the bane, I resolved to act <emph>the
                     part</emph> of the antidote. I managed to introduce the subject of the ball;
                  said there was nothing in the world I should be so much pleased to witness, and if
                  she would allow me the honour of attending her there, I should be extremely happy,
                  &amp;c., &amp;c. Her countenance became radiant with animation. From what bitter
                  mortification I had saved her! What a noble revenge would she inflict on her
                  plebeian swain!</p>
               <p>I have not leisure to tell the hows—the whys—the wherefores, and wherebys—we are
                  in the ball-room, on Thanksgiving eve—a New England ball-room. If a son or
                  daughter of the land of pilgrims should read this sketch, who has ever been so
                  blessed as to witness such a scene, they behold it at this moment in their mind's
                  eye. Scrape go the fiddles—pat go the feet—the girls, all in pure, simple white,
                  with here and there a gay ribbon and fluttering flower, scamper down the dance:
                  the young men, with stiff, starched collars, and shining metal buttons, and heavy
                  heels, foot it briskly after.</p>
               <p>The floor has a noble spring, and those who are sitting around, spectators of the
                  exhilarated actors, feel their feet keeping time involuntarily, and their heads
                  nodding, before they know what they are doing. What would my patrician friends
                  have said to see me cutting the pigeon-wing, and taking the double shuffle with
                  the superfluous animation that I exercised that evening! Yet I would not have been
                  ashamed of my sweet partner, even in the heart of the metropolis. She did look
                  lovely. To be sure, her sleeves were not twice as large as her body—her shoulders
                  were where nature placed them—and, worse than all, she wore round-toed shoes! But
                  her robe was as white as the snow on which the moonbeams shone, and her face as
                  blooming as the red rose that decorated her brow. I was really half in love with
                  her, and I rattled more nonsense in her ear than her unsophisticated imagination
                  ever dreamed of. Her vanity was greatly excited, for I was the
                     <emph>gentleman</emph> of the party, and the young girls looked upon her
                  conquest with envy—that mildew which falls on the sweet blossom of the valley as
                  well as the exotic of the greenhouse. At length the tide of youthful spirits began
                  to ebb: the bounding step softened down into a kind of weary slide: the lights
                  looked dim, and a sleepy cloud floated over the young, starry eyes shining around
                  me. Lucy never opened her lips while I was escorting her home<pb n="512-513"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000248"/> She seemed to be communing with her own conscience,
                  which probably gave her some remorseless twinges and regretful pangs. For my own
                  part, the excitement of the occasion being over, I felt a little sheepish for the
                  part I had taken.</p>
               <p>The next morning, every thing being ready for my departure, I called to bid
                  farewell to Lucy, with the commendable resolution of speaking to her frankly on
                  the subject of her jealous love, and recommending to her reconciliation and
                  forgiveness. I found her with an open letter in her lap, the living carnations of
                  her cheeks all withered and pale, and tears that seemed wrung by agony, streaming
                  from her late glad eyes.</p>
               <p>"What has happened, Lucy?" said I, trembling with indefinite apprehension. She
                  tried to speak, but could not; and then put the letter into my hand. I read it,
                  and wished I had been shot. I will transcribe it as faithfully as my memory
                  allows, and I think I remember every word of it, for it seemed stamped upon my
                  mind as with a red-hot iron.</p>

                              you know that I forgive you the wrong you've done me. Oh, Lucy! if you
                              only knew how it cut me to the heart, when you laughed at and made
                              game of me, before that fine new sweetheart of yours, you never would
                              have done it; for he never can love you as well as I have done; for
                              he's known you but a day as 'twere, and I—we've known each other from
                              children, and I've loved you better than any thing else in the world
                              ever since I knew how. I'm going to sea, to sail on the great waters,
                              and perhaps I may make my grave in them; for I don't feel as if I had
                              any thing to live for now. I always had a kind of longing for the sea;
                              but I hated to leave you behind. It's no matter now. If I thought
                              you'd be sorry, I think I'd be willing to die. Good bye, Lucy,—I hope
                              you'll be happy as long as you live.</p>

               <p>Thus ran poor William's letter. Oh, what mischief had my idle vanity wrought! What
                  would I not have given to have blotted out the record of one thoughtless hour! The
                  angel of consideration had whipped the offending spirit of coquetry from her
                  bosom. The memory of his early love and devotion—his integrity and truth—came back
                  upon her with the fragrance and freshness of the opening spring. Then the thought
                  of the cold, dark waters to which she had driven him—of his finding there an
                  untimely grave—and his injured ghost coming and standing beside her bed at the
                  midnight hour, and crying—"Oh, cruel Lucy!" I read all this in her wobegone face;
                  and penetrated with remorse, I took her hand, and said with a manly feeling, which
                  I think did me honour—"Lucy, I am sorry for you from the bottom of my heart. I am
                  alone to blame. Your William will come back again—I am sure he will—and if he<pb
                     n="514-515" xml:id="VAC6687-00000249"/> does not—by Heaven! I will marry you
                  myself! Yes, I am going a long journey—perhaps I, too, must cross the ocean; but I
                  shall return in two years, if my life is spared; and then, if you are willing, my
                  pretty Lucy, I'll marry you, and cherish you tenderly as long as I live."</p>
               <p>"You are very, very kind," sobbed Lucy, "and I like you very much—but I'd rather
                  have William, after all."</p>
               <p>Oh, simple and unadulterated nature! how eloquent thou art! Art never taught its
                  polished votaries a sentence more beautifully impressive, than this spontaneous
                  expression of truth and sensibility!</p>
               <p>Let us suppose two years and a little more are passed—that spring has covered the
                  hill-side with green, and the valley with bloom. It was this sweet season when I
                  again stopped at the village where I had spent the memorable Thanksgiving day. It
                  was Sunday. Every thing was perfectly still: even my bustling little landlady had
                  gone to meeting without asking a single question. I brushed the dust from my
                  garments, and took the path to the white church, that now contrasted beautifully
                  with the velvet common on which it was built. I entered: again I heard those deep,
                  adoring accents which had once before thrilled through my very soul: again I
                  looked on the benign countenance of the servant of God, still bearing the sacred
                  impress of his celestial embassy. I looked round. My eyes rested upon a pew not
                  far from the pulpit, and they wandered no more. I felt as if a mountain were
                  removed from my heart. Lucy was there, more beautiful than ever: her fair brow
                  turned thoughtfully upwards, and a sweet, subdued expression diffused over her
                  whole sunny face; and William was by her side, in the dignity of manhood, and, no
                  longer under the dominion of a withering passion, looked not unworthy of his
                  blooming bride. As soon as the service was over, I stood in the broad aisle,
                  waiting for them to pass out. My heart throbbed quicker as they approached with
                  that sober, decent pace, which becomes those who are leaving the temple of the
                  Most High. At length she raised her downcast eye, and it fell upon my face: a glow
                  like the morning overspread her own.</p>
               <p>"Oh! sir," said she, after the first heartfelt greeting was over, "I am so happy
                  now! William has come back, you see, and"—"And you are married," added I, taking
                  up her hesitating speech. William blushed, and turned upon her a look of such
                  pride and affection, I almost envied him. I have had many a joyous hour, but never
                  have I felt so exquisitely happy as in the conviction that moment brought me, that
                  the honest, loving hearts my folly had severed, were again united in those holy

               <head>The Stranger at the Banquet.</head>
               <p>'TWAS a festal eve. The lamps sent down their trembling rays, reflected by shining
                  crystal, and wreathing silver, on myriad forms of beauty and grace. The music sent
                  forth the most gladdening strains, and bounding feet kept time to the joyous
                  melody. Evening shades deepened into midnight gloom without, yet still the gay
                  notes were heard, and the unwearied revellers continued their graceful
                  evolutions.</p>
               <p>Just as the clock struck twelve, a stranger entered the banqueting room, and as
                  she passed slowly on unannounced, and unaccompanied by any guide or protector,
                  every eye was turned towards her. "Who can she be?" whispered a young girl to her
                  partner, drawing close to his side.</p>
               <p>He answered not, so intently was he gazing on the figure, which now stood in the
                  centre of the hall, looking calmly and immoveably on those around. Her white robes
                  fell in long, slumberous folds to her feet; her fair shining hair floated back
                  from her face, like fleecy clouds, tinged by the moonbeam's radiance, and the
                  still depths of her azure eyes shone with a mysterious, unfathomable lustre.</p>
               <p>"Why are ye gathered here?" asked she of the young maiden, who shrunk back, as she
                  glided near her, with noiseless step. "What mean these glad strains, and the
                  flowers that decorate your brows?"</p>
               <p>The low, thrilling melody of the stranger's voice echoed to the remotest corners
                  of that spacious hall, and the minstrels paused to listen.</p>
               <p>"'Tis a festal eve," answered the trembling maiden, "and we have met in joy and
                  mirth, to commemorate the era."</p>
               <p>"Why is this night chosen as a scene of festivity?" asked the sweet-voiced
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>"It is Christmas eve," replied the maiden, "the birth-night of our Saviour, and it
                  is our custom to celebrate it with music and dancing."</p>
               <p>"It was once celebrated in ancient days," said the stranger, "with a splendour and
                  beauty that would shame the decorations of these walls. While the shepherds of
                  Chaldea were watching their flocks beneath the starry glories of midnight, they
                  heard strains of more than mortal melody gushing around them—rolling above
                  them—the thrilling of invisible harps, accompanied by celestial voices, all
                  breathing one sweet, triumphant anthem—'Glory to God in the Highest; on Earth
                  peace, and good will to men.' While they listened in adoring wonder, one of the
                  stars of Heaven glided from its throne, and travelling slowly over the depths of
                  ether, held its silver lamps over the manger, where slept the babe of Bethlehem.
                  Then the wise men of the East came with their costly offerings, and laid them down
                  at the feet of the infant Redeemer. And where are your gifts?" continued she,
                  turning her still, shining eyes from one to the other of the listening throng.
                  "What have ye brought this night to lay at your Saviour's feet<pb n="518-519"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000251"/> in commemoration of your gratitude and love? Where
                  is your gold, your frankincense, your myrrh? Where are the gems from the heart's
                  treasury, that ye are ready to sacrifice on the altar of your Lord?"</p>
               <p>The young maiden whom she had first addressed, cast one tearful, earnest glance on
                  her gay companions; then unbinding the roses from her brow, the jewels from her
                  neck, and drawing from her fingers each golden ring, "Where is the altar," she
                  cried, "that I may place my offerings there?"</p>
               <p>"Come with me," said the stranger, "and I will lead you where you can find more
                  precious gifts than these. Gifts that will retain their beauty, when these
                  garlands shall wither, and the diamond and fine gold become dim."</p>
               <p>The maiden took hold of the stranger's hand, and passed through the hall, which
                  she had so lately entered in thoughtless vanity and mirth. Her companions pressed
                  round her and impeded her way. "Oh, stay with us!" they exclaimed, "and follow not
                  the steps of the stranger: your eyes are dim, your cheek is pale, shadows are
                  gathering over your face. She may lead you to the chambers of death."</p>
               <p>"Hinder me not," cried the fair maiden; "I may not slight the voice that summons
                  me. "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
                  evil.'"</p>
               <p>A celestial smile beamed on the face of the stranger as the young girl uttered
                  these words, and they disappeared from the festive hall. Through the long sweeping
                  shadows of midnight they glided on, till they came to a wretched hovel, through
                  whose shattered casements the night gust was moaning, making most melancholy
                  music. By the dim light of a taper, they beheld a pale mother, cradling her wasted
                  infant in her arms, striving to hush its feeble wailings, looking down with hollow
                  eyes on the fearful ravages of famine and disease, then raising them in agony to
                  Heaven, imploring the widow's and the orphan's God to have mercy on her.</p>
               <p>"Lay down your golden offerings here," said the stranger, "and your Saviour will
                  accept the gift. Have ye not read that whosoever presenteth a cup of cold water to
                  one of the least of his disciples, in his name, giveth it unto him?"</p>
               <p>The maiden wept, as she laid her offering in the widow's emaciated hand. Again the
                  beauteous stranger smiled. "The tear of pity," said she, "is the brightest gem
                  thou hast brought."</p>
               <p>She led her forth into the darkness once more, and held such sweet and heavenly
                  discourse that the heart of the maiden melted within her bosom. They came to a
                  dwelling whence strains of solemn music issued, and as the light streamed from the
                  arching windows, it was reflected with ghostly lustre on marble tomb-stones
                  gleaming without.</p>
               <p>"They breathe forth a requiem for the dead," said the stranger, and she entered
                  the gate through willows that wept over the path. The music ceased, and the low,
                  deep voice of prayer ascended through the silence of the night. The maiden knelt
                  on the threshold, for she felt that she was not worthy to<pb n="520-521"
                     xml:id="VAC6687-00000252"/> enter into the temple. She hardly dared to lift her
                  trembling eyes to Heaven; but bending her forehead to the dust and clasping her
                  hands on her breast, she exclaimed, "God be merciful to me a sinner!"</p>
               <p>"Thy Saviour will accept the offering," uttered the stranger in her ear; "the
                  prayer of a broken and contrite spirit, is an incense more precious to Him than
                  all the odours of the East."</p>
               <p>"You shall see me again," said the stranger, when she led the young maiden to her
                  own home, by the light of the dawning day; "you shall see me again, and we will
                  walk together once more, but not among scenes of sorrow and death, for they shall
                  all have fled away. Neither will we walk through the shades of midnight, for
                  'there will be no night there. There will be no moon, nor stars to illumine the
                  place, 'for the glory of God shall lighten it, and the Lamb be the light thereof.'
                  Farewell—I may <unclear>not dwell</unclear> with you, but ye shall come and abide
                  with <unclear>me,</unclear> if ye continue to walk in the path where I have
                     <unclear>guided</unclear> your steps."</p>
               <p>Never more were the steps of <unclear>that</unclear> young maiden seen in the
                  halls of mirth, or the <unclear>paths</unclear> of sin. She went about among the
                  children <unclear>of sorrow</unclear> and want, binding up the wounds of sorrow
                     <unclear>and</unclear> relieving the pangs of want. She hung over
                     <unclear>the</unclear> death bed of the penitent, and breathed words of
                     <unclear>of hope</unclear> into the dull ear of despair. Men looked upon her
                     <unclear>as she</unclear> passed along, in her youthful beauty, as an
                     <unclear>angel visitant</unclear>, and they blessed her in her wanderings.
                     <unclear>Her once</unclear> companions turned aside, shrinking from
                     <unclear>communion</unclear> with one whose eyes now spoke a holier language
                  than that of earth. They felt that she was no longer one of them, and after
                  wondering and speaking of her a little while, she was forgotten by them in the
                  revelries of pleasure.</p>
               <p>At length she was no longer seen by those who watched for her daily ministrations.
                  Her place was vacant in the temple of God. The music of her voice was no more
                  heard in prayer and praise. On a lowly couch in her own darkened room, that young
                  maiden was reclining. Her face was pallid, and her eyes dim, and her mother was
                  weeping over her. Flowers were strewed upon her pillow, whose sweet breath stole
                  lovingly over her faded cheek; and as the curtains of the windows waved softly in
                  the night breeze, the moonbeams glided in and kissed her wan brow. The mother
                  heard no step, but she felt the air part near the couch, and looking up she saw a
                  figure standing in white flowing robes by her daughter's side, with a face of such
                  unearthly sweetness, she trembled as she gazed upon her.</p>
               <p>"Maiden," said she, "I have come once more. I told thee we should meet again, and
                  this is the appointed hour. Does thy spirit welcome my coming?"</p>
               <p>"My soul has thirsted for thee," answered the faint voice of the maiden, "even as
                  the blossom thirsts for the dew of the morning; but I may not follow thee now, for
                  my feeble feet bear me no longer over the threshold of home."</p>
               <p>"Thy feet shall be as the young roe on the mountain," answered the white-robed
                  stranger; "thou shalt<pb n="522-523 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6687-00000253"/>
                  mount on wings as the eagle." Then bending over the couch, and breathing on the
                  cheek of the maiden, its pale hue changed to the whiteness of marble, and the hand
                  which her mother held, turned cold as an icicle. At the same moment the folds of
                  the stranger's robe floated from her shoulders, and wings of resplendent azure
                  softening into gold, fluttered on the gaze. Divine perfumes filled the atmosphere,
                  and a low, sweet melody, like the silvery murmuring of distant waters, echoed
                  through the chamber. Awe-struck and bewildered, the mother turned from the
                  breathless form of her child, to the celestial figure of the stranger, when she
                  saw it gradually fading from her sight, and encircled in its arms there seemed
                  another being of shadowy brightness, with outspread wings and fleecy robes, and
                  soft, glorious eyes fixed steadfastlly on her, till they melted away and were seen
                  no more. Then the mother bowed herself in adoration, as well as submission; for
                  she knew she had looked on one of those angel messengers who are "sent to minister
                  to those who shall be heirs of salvation." She had seen, too, a vision of her
                  daughter's ascending spirit, and she mourned not over the dust she had left
                  behind.</p>

            <head>GREAT INDUCEMENTS FOR 1856!</head>
            <head>NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE UP CLUBS!</head>
            <head>PETERSON'S MAGAZINE</head>
            <p>The best and cheapest in the World for Ladies.</p>
            <p>EDITED BY MRS. ANN S. STEPHENS AND CHARLES J. PETERSON.</p>
            <p>This popular Magazine, already the cheapest and best Monthly of its kind in the
               world, <emph>will be greatly improved for</emph> 1856. It will contain 900 pages of
               double-column reading matter; from twenty to thirty Steel Plates; and <emph>over four
                  hundred</emph> Wood Engravings: which is proportionately more than any periodical,
               of any price, ever yet gave.</p>
            <p>ITS THRILLING ORIGINAL STORIES Are pronounced, by the press, <emph>the best published
                  anywhere.</emph> The editors are Mrs. Ann S. Stephens, author of "The Old
               Homestead," "Fashion and Famine," and Charles J. Peterson, author of "Kate
               Aylesford." "The Valley Farm," etc., etc.; and they are assisted by all the most
               popular female writers of America. New talent is continually being added,
                  <emph>regardless of expense,</emph> so as to keep "Peterson's Magazine"
               unapproachable in merit. Morality and virtue are always inculcated.</p>
            <p>ITS COLORED FASHION PLATES IN ADVANCE. It is the only Magazine whose Fashion Plates
               can be relied on.</p>
            <p>Each Number contains a Fashion Plate, engraved on Steel, colored <foreign
                  xml:lang="FRA">a la mode,</foreign> and of unrivalled beauty. The Paris, London,
               Philadelphia, and New York Fashions are described, at length, each month. Every
               number also contains a dozen or more New Styles, engraved on Wood. Also, a Pattern,
               from which a dress, mantilla, or child's costume, can be cut, without the aid of a
               mantua-maker, so that each number, in this way, will <emph>save a year's
                  subscription.</emph>
            </p>
            <p>Its superb Mezzotints, and other Steel Engravings.</p>
            <p>Its Illustrations excel those of any other Magazine, each number containing a superb
               Steel Engraving, either mezzotint or line, beside the Fashion Plate; and, in
               addition, numerous other Engravings, Wood Cuts, Patterns, &amp;c., &amp;c. The
               Engravings, at the end of the year, <emph>alone</emph> are worth the subscription
               price.</p>
            <p>PATTERNS FOR CROTCHET, NEEDLEWORK, etc., In the greatest profusion, are given in
               every number, with instructions how to work them; also, Patterns in Embroidery,
               Inserting, Broiderie Anglaise, Netting, Lace-making, &amp;c., &amp;c. Also, Patterns
               for Sleeves, Collars, and Chemisettes; Patterns in Bead-work, Hair-work, Shell-work;
               Handkerchief Corners; Names for Making and Initials. Each number contains a Paper
               Flower, with directions how to make it. A piece of new and fashionable Music is also
               published every month. On the whole, it is the <emph>most complete Ladies' Magazine

            <head>ERNEST LINWOOD.</head>
            <head type="sub">BY MRS. CAROLINE LEE HENTZ.</head>
            <p>THE LAST WORK WRITTEN BY HER PRIOR TO HER DEATH.</p>
            <p>Although but a single month has passed since the first copy of this brilliant book
               was issued, yet so great has been the demand for the last and most beautiful work
               from the pen of its lamented authoress, that we are now printing the TWENTIETH
               THOUSAND, with an unabated demand still pressing us. Since the days of the
               Lamplighter, no book has sold so rapidly, or become so universally popular. Col.
               Fuller, of the <title>New York Mirror,</title> in one of the most elegant articles
               ever penned, in regard to authors or their productions, uses the following strong and
               beautiful language:</p>
            <q>
               <p>"ERNEST LINWOOD.</p>
               <lg type="quotation">
                  <l>"'Death darkens his eye, and unplumes his wings,</l>
                  <l>But the sweetest song is the last he sings.'</l>
               </lg>
               <p>"In the volume entitled 'Ernest Linwood,' just issued by Jewett &amp; Co., of
                  Boston, we have the dying song of the elegant and gifted Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz.
                  Mournfully sweet, like the sigh of an Æolian lyre, yet deep and oracular as the
                  voice of many waters, it seems to have been poured forth while her soul floated
                  down to the ocean of Rest. On almost every page, we can trace the shadow of the
                  death-angel, who bore her away when her song was ended. Mysterious gleams from
                  beneath the uplifting vail of Spirit-land startle us as we read. The book is a
                  broadcast farewell—a lingering hand-grasp from one we loved. If we mistake not,
                  its most impressive passages are revelations of the inner life of the
                  writer—wonderfully vivid and absorbing, because wonderfully real. We will not
                  attempt to follow out, in this notice, the thread of an inimitable tale; in so
                  doing, we should only anticipate scenes and events which come, with beautiful
                  linkings and fine effect, before the eye of the reader. We would not rob the book
                  of half its charm. Sweet Gabriella Lynn will tell her own story."</p>
