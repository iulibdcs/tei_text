THE&#xD;
WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
A RAY FROM THE EAST.&#xD;
YOUNG Mr. Edward Wetherel and his more mature friend Mr. Frank&#xD;
Wolverton were on the after promenade deck of the steamer Elm City,&#xD;
bound from New York to New Haven.&#xD;
" Yes, I see her," said Wolverton, looking at the young lady whom Weth-&#xD;
erel was pointing out to him. "Pretty girl. Shines like a star. Wonderful&#xD;
air of innocence. Who is she?"&#xD;
"'I think I shall astonish you, Wolverton," replied Wetherel, obviously tak-&#xD;
ing much pleasure in talking about this young lady. " She is the daughter of&#xD;
a missionary."&#xD;
"Missionary! You do astonish me. One has an idea that such people&#xD;
don't have children, or have little monsters of plainness and grimness. 'A fel-&#xD;
low naturally thinks, you know, that a missionary's daughter would only mak&#xD;
a show in society on the principle that handsome is as handsome does. Whe e&#xD;
does she come fromP"&#xD;
"From the Nestorian country, somewhere in Persia, I fancy. Her father&#xD;
is quite a famous man among his set, I understand. He has done some n6tori-&#xD;
ous wrestling with heathenism, or whatever the religion of -the country may&#xD;
be. ' The celebrated Doctor Bernard.' I heard a white-cravated gentleman call&#xD;
him."&#xD;
He had better leave his missionarying to his daughter," pronounced Wol-&#xD;
verton, gazing steadily at the girl and with a gentler  expression in his eyes&#xD;
than was habitual with them. "I don't believe the celebrated Doctor Bernard&#xD;
could hold a candle to such a young lady in the work of bringing over mishe-&#xD;
lievers. If I were the .chief high priest of the Nestorians, or whatever they&#xD;
call themselves, and that little beauty should ask me to break down my altars&#xD;
and forsake the faith of my ancestors, I should say, Certainly! any little thing&#xD;
of the sort to please you."&#xD;
This talk was both jesting and serious. The two men spoke lightly of the&#xD;
missionary "work," obviously to them a dim and unimportant quixotism; but&#xD;
with regard to the girl they were entirely sincere and respectful. Of the so-&#xD;
lemnity of religious matters they had apparently no more perception than if&#xD;
they had been denizens of some planet to, which no divine revelation, whether&#xD;
natural or verbal, had ever been granted. The worshipfulness of beauty, how-&#xD;
&#xD;

<pb  n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6242-00000004"/>&#xD;
T                    THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
ever, they could see plainly, and they were creditably sensitive, as it appeared,&#xD;
to maidenly purity.&#xD;
Personally these two civilized heathens were themselves worthy of admir-&#xD;
ing consideration. Wolverton, although not much short of forty, was as agree.&#xD;
able to the artistic eye as many much younger men are, his curling black hair&#xD;
being still fresh and glossy, his large brown eyes healthfully clear and resolute,&#xD;
his darkly-pale cheek as firm in look as marble, and his broad, muscular fig-&#xD;
ure fitfor a boat race. Wetherel, who might have been about twenty-five, was&#xD;
tall, flexible, and graceful, with a blonde complexion, waving light hair, intel-&#xD;
ligent gray eyes, and features in the main regular. The defect in his face was&#xD;
a chin too prominent, too domineering, and we might say too virile. Even&#xD;
in a man one would like to see more meekness of temper and persuasibility of'&#xD;
mind than this chin permitted.&#xD;
Both were dressed with a scrupulous neatness and fastidious taste which in-&#xD;
dicated a brahminic position in society. Only the rich and leisurely, only those&#xD;
who have been able to, give their lives to.dandyism, can attain to such fault-&#xD;
lessness of costume. They were in summer suits, and yet they mirrored the&#xD;
fashions. It seemed as if dust would stop short in its flight toward such neat-&#xD;
ness, and as if grime would fall reverentially at its feet without soiling it.&#xD;
Spectators of the workaday class, if of a humble-minded and impressible na-&#xD;
ture, might easily imagine such clothing as exhaling an aroma of daintiness&#xD;
and giving forth a halo of high-breeding. Of a hot summer's day it would&#xD;
have seemed little less than abnormal and monstrous to be so vestured in neat-&#xD;
ness and freshness and triumphal grace as were these lilies of the club and the&#xD;
drawing-room. But the day, although sultry enough on shore to remind one&#xD;
of the air of forges, was breezy and restorative on the deck of the Elm City.&#xD;
The stainless flannel coats and delicate silken scarfs of the two dandies were&#xD;
appropriate to the cleansed and sweetened air which blew over the azure wave-&#xD;
lets of Long Island Sound.&#xD;
"Look at her now," said Wolverton, attracted by some change in the'coun-&#xD;
tenance of the girl whom lie was watching, one of those beautiful changes&#xD;
which come over young and innocent faces, the reflections of a fawn-like enjoy-&#xD;
ment of life. "I never saw such another entangling, attaching face." Then&#xD;
he added, after a long pause as if for a deep sigh, " Never but once! There is&#xD;
something tremendous in the power of a resemblance. I don't mind telling&#xD;
you, youngster-in fact it is a sober sort of pleasure for me to tell you-that I&#xD;
have seen such a face as that once before, and that it was the angelic sight of&#xD;
my life. Death is a scoundrelly robber. If that face had not been carried be-&#xD;
yond my sight, I should have passed my life beneath it, looking up to it. I&#xD;
have been a worse man for being plundered in that way. Well," lie con-&#xD;
cluded with another sigh, "that was seven years ago. I wish we could smoke&#xD;
here."  .&#xD;
The younger man looked at the elder with respectful astonishment. He&#xD;
had discovered a heart where he had little looked to find one. He was like&#xD;
one who, wandering through halls of gayety and watching the feet of dancers,&#xD;
beholds the bloodstain of a bygone tragedy. In the unexpected presence of&#xD;
revelations- of this sorrowful aspect, the eyes of the lightest and hardest are apt&#xD;
to fill with solemn wonder, or at least with pitying curiosity.&#xD;
" You, Wolverton!" said Wetherel, in a tone of pensive amazement. Then&#xD;
he changed the subject, for he had some capacity of delicate sympathy in him&#xD;
or at least lhe, had its counterpart, good-bieeding.&#xD;
&#xD;

TILE WETIHEREL AFFAIR.                       7&#xD;
"Of course we cati smoke on the forward deck," he added. " Do you par-&#xD;
'ticularly care for it?"&#xD;
"No. I would rather look at this girl."&#xD;
"Do you want to talk with her? I know her well enough to take you up."&#xD;
"No. The charm might pass away. - It wouldn't be the same voice.. I&#xD;
prefer to look at her. By the way, where did you meet her?"&#xD;
"On the steamer from England."&#xD;
" Oh, the steamer! Jolly place for courting, an ocean steamer," said Wol-&#xD;
verton, throwing off his rarely-worn seriousness, and appearing once more in&#xD;
the spiritual garb of a veteran of society. " Your romance kills mine. Of&#xD;
course you two became intimate and walked arm in arm by the moonlight, and&#xD;
all that sort of thing. So she is just in the country, just fresh from the mis-&#xD;
sionary harvest, just from the Orient!. How odd and interesting our stupid&#xD;
American life must seem to her! She, is having emotions every minute. I&#xD;
wish to heaven I was young again. The greatest pleasure I know now is to&#xD;
take a child to the theatre and watch its wonder. I shall have to smoke," he&#xD;
added, turning serious once more. "Go and talk to the new soul from Mount&#xD;
Ararat. Show her the tower of Babel."&#xD;
With th6 serious face of a wearied worldling who remembers that he once&#xD;
came near living a' better life than that of egoism, he drew from his pocket&#xD;
the consolation of a cigar-case, and sought the forecastle deck of the steamer.&#xD;
Wetherel, left to himself, wavered hither and thither an instant, and then&#xD;
advanced to the young lady. She did not see him; her eyes wire fixed on the&#xD;
distant blue shore of Connecticut; they were settled,,pensive, nnd almost sad,&#xD;
- as if longing for the far-away home.&#xD;
  "Nestoria?" he asked.&#xD;
What    she replied, looking up at him with inquiry and surprise, while&#xD;
a fairy mob of blushes rushed into her cheeks.&#xD;
" Have I spoken the magic name? " he smiled.&#xD;
"It is my name," she, confessed. "IIow did you know it?"&#xD;
" What! Is your name Nestoria?" he almost exclaimed, so interesting was&#xD;
the discovery. " I did not know it at all, and couldn't have guessed it. I sup.&#xD;
posed you were thinking of your native mountains. So I asked you, Nesto-&#xD;
ria?"&#xD;
"Oh!"   And here the blushes rioted again, fighting in a field of lilies.&#xD;
"So I exposed myself."&#xD;
"Don't you like the name? " he wondered, for he had already decided that&#xD;
it was a chai-ming one.&#xD;
"i I ought. My father likes it; and it is his field. Ie named me after the&#xD;
people among whom he labors., And yet I can't quite like it. People ask me&#xD;
so many questions about it, and exclaim so much about it; such a strange&#xD;
name! atnd oh, what a beautiful name! and isn't it singularP I am so tired of&#xD;
=      hearing about it that I call myself Nettie. Nestoria sounds too grand for a lit-&#xD;
tle bit of a woman. Don't you think so ? It seems like blowing a trumpet before&#xD;
me. I like Nettie best."&#xD;
"I like both," responded the New York dandy and man-about-town. The&#xD;
tender seriousness with which he treaed the subject was certainly curious in a&#xD;
practised beau who had the fame of being a lady-killer. It was also very&#xD;
agreeable; it ridded him of the confident smile and fatuous levity with which&#xD;
r   no was wont to spoil the effect of his compliments; it enabled him to say his&#xD;
pleasant thing with a sincere tone, which made it gracious and effective.&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
It must be understood that he already knew the missionary's daughter well,&#xD;
and liked her much. Eleven days of close companionship on shipboard had&#xD;
made them intimates, and had landed him on that island of norceries where&#xD;
men see women as seraphs. He knew the girl's whole history; he had drawn&#xD;
from her long reminiscences of her secluded, strange life in Erzeroum and the&#xD;
Kurdish mountains; he had heard her tell of turbaned chiefs and veiled beau-&#xD;
ties until it seemed a wonder to him that she wore familiar vestments and,&#xD;
spoke English; he had looked at her through the enchantment of distance, and&#xD;
clothedaher in the mystery of the Orient, and made a poem of her. She was,&#xD;
in many ways, like an inhabitant of some other world to him. Her ideas were&#xD;
as novel and curious as her recollections. She knew almost nothing of the&#xD;
fashionable, worldly existence which was nearly all that he did know. She&#xD;
was as ignorant and innocent as if she had just come out of the Garden of&#xD;
Eden. Even her language was odd to him; it sounded in his ears as did the&#xD;
speech of Christian and Faithful in the ears of the men of "Vanity Fair."; he&#xD;
was at first displeased, then amused, and then charmed when she talked pf&#xD;
" the missionary work," of "Christian labors," of "the conversion of the East."&#xD;
These phrases sounded like cant, but in a little while they sounded like poetry.&#xD;
He likened himself to an angel of darkness who should take a fancy to the so-&#xD;
ciety of a cherub fresh from Paradise.&#xD;
What a fascination, there was in her innocence and simplicity! When he&#xD;
told her that he liked both her names she did not guess why; she looked up at&#xD;
him with a childlike expression that was part surprise and part pleasure. He&#xD;
had never before seen such virginity of soul, and he had the exultation of a&#xD;
navigator who discovers a new island hitherto unvisited by mortals.&#xD;
"Did you ever know any or e called Nettie? " she asked; meaning, did you&#xD;
like her, and so like the name?&#xD;
"I never din," he answered smiling, because he understood the drift of the&#xD;
question, and was charmed with the lack of egotism which it proved.&#xD;
"Then why    - -" she hesitated.&#xD;
"Oh, they are pretty names," he said, feeling that he was on the brink of&#xD;
an abyss, and drawing back from it. He did not dare to say, "I like the names&#xD;
because I like the person who bears them; " for an interior thrill warned him&#xD;
that the confession might have a mighty momentum in it; and he was not yet&#xD;
prepared for a declaration of, love.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
A BEGINNING OF SORROW.&#xD;
" THEY are both pretty names," Wetherel repeated, unable to let the fasci-&#xD;
nating subject alone. "And of the two I think I like Nestoria the best. If I&#xD;
were related to you, I should call you Nestoria."&#xD;
The girl wanted to say, "You may call me so," but after reflecting a mo-&#xD;
ment, it seemed best not. The young man's eyes were be~nt upon her face&#xD;
with an expression of admiration which she did not fully comprehend, but&#xD;
which nevertheless embarrassed her and thwarted her childlike confidence.&#xD;
Of course the most potent spring of the (- may's admiration for Nestoria was&#xD;
her beauty. Her guilelessness of character and her puritanisms of speech'&#xD;
would have appeared to him ridiculous, had she been homely. But he found&#xD;
it impossible to laugh at her, impossible not to -grant her a certain worship&#xD;
when he looked at her.&#xD;
&#xD;
ay  ~     a&#xD;
_ T&#xD;
&#xD;
She was certainly quite handsome, and there were moments when she daz-&#xD;
zled. At first you hardly noticed this little figure, and this infantile blonde&#xD;
face. But presently you could not help remarking how regular the small fea-&#xD;
tures were, how delicate the rose and lily complexion, and how heaven-like&#xD;
the blue eyes. Then came a revelation of golden hair, so luxuriant as to re-&#xD;
mind one of fields of yellow corn, and bright through all its wavings with an&#xD;
inner sunshine. This hair had fascinated Wetherel; one stormy day on the&#xD;
occaii it had burst its bonds and flooded the girl to the waist;. and he never&#xD;
afterwards escaped from the bewildering influence of those radiant tresses. It&#xD;
was from the date of that aureate inundation that .he began to find all Nesto-&#xD;
ria's ways, all her retired, prim ideas, and all her puritanic phrases, no longer&#xD;
displeasing or odd, but charming.&#xD;
All the sense and self-command that he possessed had been needed to keep&#xD;
him from making downright court to the girl on the Cunarder; and indeed,&#xD;
nothing but luck, nothing but accidental interventions of fellow-passengers,&#xD;
had delivered him from the snares set for him by certain moonlights. One&#xD;
might think that the obscurities of evening would have shorn the brilliance&#xD;
from a beauty-of which color formed so great a part. But it was not so; this&#xD;
child could spare the rose, the lily, and the gold; her features were fine enough&#xD;
for that. And the moonlight so idealized her, it made her so like ethereal mar-&#xD;
ble, it gave her such a brightness of better worlds, that she seemed more than&#xD;
human., Like a star she grew in loveliness as evening gathered its magic.&#xD;
veils about her. Wetherel, who was half a pagan in education and almost&#xD;
wholly pagan in soul, used to'think of Venus rising from the sea and of Cyp-&#xD;
rian multitudes bowing in adoration.&#xD;
, Well, he had not proposed to her during the ocean voyage ; but he had&#xD;
shown his interest so plainly that a coquette would have been aware of a con-&#xD;
quest; and even this innocent from Kurdistan had perceived that she was liked.&#xD;
They were well acquainted; when they met on the Elm City it was as two old&#xD;
friends meet; it seemed to each-of them that they had known each other, for-&#xD;
ever. As the boat wound up the picturesque turns of the East River Wetherel&#xD;
had pointed out to Nestoria all the objects of note, delighting in her naive&#xD;
4    pleasure and wonder. Then,.discovering Wolverton, his model and mentor in&#xD;
the ways of worldliness, he had joined him for a moment to show him Nestoria&#xD;
and to enjoy his admiration. And now, Wolverton having gone to his lonely&#xD;
solace of a cigar, he had fluttered back moth-like to his candle.&#xD;
As that luminary made no response to his declared preference for her name&#xD;
of Nestoria, and as he felt that the subject might be perilous to his bachelor&#xD;
freedom if he should pursue it, he looked about the visible cosmos for another.&#xD;
"Ilow perfectly beautiful the sea is to-day," was his commonplace remark,&#xD;
greatly ennobled to him, however, by the feeling which prompted it. Try as&#xD;
he would to evade the dominion of this girl, he could not utter a word which&#xD;
was not pervaded by her. The sea was more to him than its wont, simply be-&#xD;
cause it served as a background to her face and figure, and thus seemed to&#xD;
y     partake of her personality. Everything that he looked upon in her company&#xD;
acquired beauty in his eyes, for the reason that she also beheld it. Within&#xD;
the last fortnight he had discovered a new heaven and a new earth, hitherto&#xD;
unknown to him and even unsuspected. It is pretty clear that, notwithstand-&#xD;
ing some remaining anchor of prudence, his heart was beginning to drift dan-&#xD;
gerously. We can understand now the prompt and serious sympathy which&#xD;
he had accorded to Wolverton's tale of shipwrecked love.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6242-00000006"/>&#xD;
10                   THE WETIHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"It is beautiful," replied Nestoria, her clear blue eyes looking down like&#xD;
two little cloudless heavens upon the indigo wavelets. Then, with a pathetic'&#xD;
expression of sadness, resignation, and awe, slip added, "And wonderful!"&#xD;
She wanted to say, "Terrible!"  The ocean represented to her a majesty&#xD;
and power which were more than earthly; there were moments when it seemed&#xD;
to carry her off, as a little speck, beyond the bounds of time; moments when&#xD;
it was no longer an ocean, but an eternity. A feeling of intense loneliness and&#xD;
a longing remembrance of her only parent, so far away, deepened this senti-&#xD;
ment of solemnity and also touched it with tenderness. Had she known Weth-_&#xD;
erel well enough she would have taken his hand, and held it for a sense of com-&#xD;
panionship. As it was, she turned to a text: " 0 God of-our salvation, who&#xD;
art the confidence of them that are afar off upon the sea; " these words seemed&#xD;
to walk before her upon the waters. It was one of the verses which her father&#xD;
had asked her to learn by heart before he parted with her. Had she been&#xD;
among her familiar friends, the devout missionaries with whom she had passed&#xD;
her youth, she would have repeated it aloud. Even now the sentence seemed&#xD;
to wrestle at her lips; but glancing furtively at Wetherel's face, she said to&#xD;
herself, "IHe might think it very strange; " for gentle and sympathetic as he&#xD;
had been to her, she did not yet feel certain that he .could stare all her ieas;&#xD;
and, indeed, well might she doubt it.&#xD;
Of a sudden she turned her face toward the waters. Wetherel leaned for-&#xD;
ward ever so little, and saw a single tear upon her cheek. .As much moved by&#xD;
it as if it had been the only tear ever shed in the world, he said in a burst of&#xD;
pity, "Y du are very lonely."&#xD;
"Yes' I am," she murmured, still trying to hide her face.&#xD;
The confession hurt him; then he was nothing to her; his presence was no&#xD;
consolation! But of course there was nothing to be .done about it, and while&#xD;
he was still looking blank and feeling uncomfortable and finding nothing to say,&#xD;
the girl unexpectedly recovered her self-possession as women will, and looked&#xD;
up at him with a peculiarly arch, childlike smile, which was characteristic of&#xD;
some of her moods, and which had already delighted him many times.&#xD;
"If it would relieve your mind to call me a baby, you may do so," she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"I don't think you are a baby at all," he protested. " Why, what a great&#xD;
distance you have travelled, and almost alone! "-i&#xD;
"A baby might go as far in a baby-wagon, if its nurse would only push it.&#xD;
I couldn't very well help myself. I was put on a mule, and a screaming&#xD;
mountaineer drove it; and then I was put into a steamer, and other men drove&#xD;
that. Oh, the journey has come easily enough; one day followed another.&#xD;
You are never called on to do on Monday the work that is allotted to Tuesday&#xD;
and Wednesday and Thursday, and so on. And so it will be, I suppose,&#xD;
throughout life and with other things as well as journeys."&#xD;
"You are as brave as a lion," he laughed approvingly, at the same time&#xD;
thinking what a cheerful little wife she would make, and how well she would&#xD;
bear his troubles for him. "But what do you mean to do throughout life?"&#xD;
" And you?" she asked, her arch smile sparkling up once more, like a&#xD;
runny bubble rising to the surface of a fountain.&#xD;
"I? " he repeated somewhat discomfited, for his existence hitherto had&#xD;
been idle and his future was aimless. " Really, I hardly know.".&#xD;
"Then how can I know what I shall do?" she answered more pensively.&#xD;
"Awoman has so little strength that she can hardly have plans; isn'tta sor&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         11&#xD;
And yet, although you will perhaps laugh at me when I tell you of it, I do&#xD;
venture to harbor some aims and aspirations. I want to do what work I can&#xD;
and what good I can."&#xD;
"Oh, don't!" he protested. " People who live to do good are -generally&#xD;
awfully irksome."&#xD;
"I am sorry you think so," she replied, looking him full in the fate with&#xD;
an air of grave surprise and disappointment. " It has not been my experi-&#xD;
ence." Then,-thinking no doubt that her tone had been too monitorial, she&#xD;
threw out a meek olive-branch of a smile and added, "I wish you could meet&#xD;
my father. You would see one man who lives to do good, and who is charm-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"I should feel honored to meet him," bowed Wetherel, anxious to recover&#xD;
lost ground in her esteem. "You must excuse what I said just now. I was&#xD;
thinking perhaps of people who merely talk of living for the benefit of others,&#xD;
and stop-there."&#xD;
"Parrots who say1Pretty Polly, and never do anything pretty," she laughed,&#xD;
_.evidently pleased to hear him right himself.&#xD;
Now this was cheerful conversation, and Mr. Edward Wetherel could not&#xD;
of course help finding it pleasant, and yet his soul was not entirely satisfied&#xD;
with it. lie was more sentimentally content with the girl when. she was sad,&#xD;
because then he could imagine himself as gathering her into his philanthropic&#xD;
bosom and cherishing her with consolation. So he reverted once more to her&#xD;
condition of isolation and loneliness.&#xD;
You have, I am afraid, very few friends in America."&#xD;
Very few," she admitted, with the cheerful little nod of a canary, and in&#xD;
fact with far less of depression than he had longed to see. "But the few are&#xD;
very good. I shall be with sonic of them to-night. I wonder if you ever beard&#xD;
of them-a Mrs. Dinneford and her daughter Alice."&#xD;
"A Mrs. Dinneford and her daughter Alice are my relatives," he answered,&#xD;
surprised rather than gratified.&#xD;
Are.-they?" said Nestoria, obviously delighted., "I was with them often&#xD;
in London. You'know I stopped almost six months in London with an Eng--&#xD;
lish lady-a lady who knew about my father and who is very kind to mission-&#xD;
ary people. Her brother brought me on from Erzeroum; he is a great anti-&#xD;
quarian and made wonderful discoveries in Babylon; but I told you all that&#xD;
on the Arabia. At this lady's house I met Mrs. Dinneford and Alice. Isn't&#xD;
Alice pleasant, and isn't her mother good? They asked me to visit them in&#xD;
Anerica, and when I reached New York I found a letter for me. Oh, you&#xD;
can't imagine how it cheered me., I felt like Paul when he met the brethren&#xD;
at the Three Taverns. They are at Savin Rock, near New Haven."&#xD;
"At the house of a Mr.. Wetherel?" asked the young man coldly.&#xD;
"Yes," she said, her smile dancing out gayly,.like a fairy leaping from a&#xD;
rose. "our name!"&#xD;
Ile pondered a moment, and then observed gravely, "I cannot call on you&#xD;
there."&#xD;
She did not reply; it was clearly a momentous piece of information; and&#xD;
her gaze of inquiry showed even more regret than surprise.&#xD;
"No," he went on, biting his moustache. "Mr. Jabez Wetherel is my un-&#xD;
cle; and I ami sorry, very sorry to say it, but we are not on good terms."-&#xD;
"Ia  orry too," sh1e murmured; what else could such a child say?&#xD;
" Still, I will try to see you, if you permit it," he continued. " I venture to&#xD;
hope that I shall, be able to meet you again somewhere."&#xD;
&#xD;

12                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"I shall be pleased," was her answer. Then she said no more on the sub&#xD;
ject, being not quite'sure that she had not done wrong in saying even so much;&#xD;
for the fact of a family quarrel was a terribly ugly one to her mind, throwing&#xD;
doubtful shadows upon the people who were engaged in it, and rendering her&#xD;
pathway among them intricate.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
A FRIENDLY WELCOME.&#xD;
THE Elm City, although freighted with a possible hero and heroine, reached&#xD;
New Haven without misadventure.&#xD;
As it zigzagged up the shallow harbor Wetherel pointed out to Nestoria the&#xD;
country-seat of his uncle, a low, wide-spreading wooden house, with pillared&#xD;
veranda and pointed gables, nested on a little rocky bluff which rose some&#xD;
thirty feet above the yellow beach. The girl looked at it in silence and with a&#xD;
slight sense of aversion, for which she conscientiously reproved herself. The&#xD;
dwelling did not seem to her heartily hospitable, because this very kind and&#xD;
sweet-mannered young gentleman might not enter it. Notwithstanding her&#xD;
keen sense of loneliness in America, and the pleasure with which she had but&#xD;
lately looked forward to meeting her friends, the dear, good Dinnefords, she&#xD;
would have been not unwilling.to pass the night at a hotel.&#xD;
"It is a long way from the city," she said, with a suppressed sigh which&#xD;
meant, "Perhaps we shall not meet again."&#xD;
" Yes, four miles," he replied. " If you will allow me, I will drive out there&#xD;
with you; that is, if my uncle has not sent a carriage for you."&#xD;
"I expect one," she sighed, again, half hoping that it might not arrive.&#xD;
" Alice tdiegraphed me that she would be on the dock. She would have come&#xD;
to New York for me, only I wouldn't let her. I hate to have people take&#xD;
trouble about me."'&#xD;
"You shouldn't," he declared. "You are worth taking trouble for." .&#xD;
He looked down in admiration at the sweet innocent face which was turned&#xD;
up towards his in wonder at his flattering speech. It was a constant marvel&#xD;
to him that she should not be aware of her own fascinations and'use them to&#xD;
command service. A dandy, a mere worldling, a spoiled child of flattery, he&#xD;
had not a suspicion of the education of humility and self-abnegation which she&#xD;
had received. He had serious-minded relations,-it is true, but he had avoided&#xD;
them as far as possible, and in his aversion given their characters no intelli-&#xD;
gent study, so that he had grown up in a sort of heathenish ignorance of 'the&#xD;
workings and ways of devout souls. He could not have guessed that any one,&#xD;
not even' a piously faithful father, not even a clergyman and missionary, would&#xD;
say daily to such an endearing little beauty as this, " We are dust and ashes;&#xD;
we are worthless worms of the earth; we have no manner of merit of our own;&#xD;
we live from day to day by sufferance; our sole honor is humility, our sole&#xD;
hope is mercy." Even had he divined the fact of such lessons, he could not&#xD;
have, believed that she would take them seriously to heart and learn from them&#xD;
to hold herself in little esteem. That she was not vain or self-consqious he had&#xD;
discovered; but he attributed it'to natural modesty, and gave her all the glory.&#xD;
.The touch of the steamer against the wooden sides of the Belle D~ock brought&#xD;
Alice Dinneford upon the scene, as the rubbing of a lamp or other talisman in&#xD;
the "Arabian Nights" calls in a friendly genii. The moment the gangway&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        13&#xD;
plank was laid, this impulsive young lady bounded across it, rustled vehe-&#xD;
veh mently through the throng of disembarking passengers, and gathered her guest&#xD;
into her cordial arms. -A tall brunette, with flashing eyes and an assured man-&#xD;
ner, she was a striking contrast to the blonde and childlike Nestoria, the two&#xD;
forming.some such a bouquet as a pink and a lily of the valley.&#xD;
In a few minutes the waif from the Kurdish mountains found herself in&#xD;
Jabez Wetherel's ancient rockaway, driving soberly among the rectangles&#xD;
of New Haven. She had not bidden good-by to Edward Wetherel; he had&#xD;
disappeared during the confusion of the landing. It seemed to Nestoria that&#xD;
he must have avoided Alice intentionally, and the suspicion was sad enough to&#xD;
throw a chill over even her meeting with a dear friend. It was so strange&#xD;
and dreadful that cousins should not speak, especially when they were both&#xD;
such good and charming people! During the whole drive Nestoria thought&#xD;
of this ugly avoidance; and it was because of it she did not mention Edward&#xD;
Wetherel's name.&#xD;
"nSo here you are at last! " prattled the lively Alice. "I am so glad to get.&#xD;
hold of you. Why didn't 'ou let me come down to New York after you P&#xD;
You are such a little speck of a thing that you mustn't go wandering alone in&#xD;
this way. You might get lost out of a sail-boat, out of a basket, out of a&#xD;
thimble, and nobody notice it."&#xD;
"I caine across the ocean with only an old lady," said Nestoria. "I know&#xD;
how to cling fast to. somebody or other."&#xD;
'She had hold of Alice's dress at that very moment. It was a charming little&#xD;
- trick of hers, indicative of her ,clinging, confiding nature, thus to lay an infari-&#xD;
tile, tendril-like clasp upon the garments of her friends. On the Elm City there&#xD;
had been a minute when she could hardly refrain from slyly taking the skirt&#xD;
of Edward Wetherel's coat between her thumb and finger in order to enjoy&#xD;
that precious luxury of hers, the sense of attaching herself closely to a protector.&#xD;
'Besides," she added, "my father doesn't like to have me be a charge to&#xD;
people."&#xD;
"A charge to people ! You! " laughed Alice. "Wait till people find fault&#xD;
about it. What Turkish ideas your father has. He has forgotten what a&#xD;
young lady passes for in America. Don't you know that we are the salt of the&#xD;
earth hereP"&#xD;
' Oh, no!" protested Nestoria, who was' accustomed to hear that phrase&#xD;
used in a very solemn sense.&#xD;
The cream of the cream, then," varied Alice, with a glimpse of her friend's&#xD;
sensitiveness as to the perversion of Scriptural language.&#xD;
"It depends upon how we behave," seriously replied Nestoria. She re-&#xD;
membered at the moment a sermon of her father's to his, oriental flock, in&#xD;
which he had said, "Men aid women are precisely equal in the sight of their&#xD;
Creator; they are both of value merely because the cross was uplifted for both;&#xD;
merely because both may equally lay hold of divine mercy."&#xD;
"It depends upon how we look," insisted Alice. "But ,never mind about&#xD;
that now. I must tell you what sort of a life you are to have at Sea Lodge.&#xD;
Sea Lodge is the name'of Uncle Wetherel's villa. He wanted to call it Mount&#xD;
Horeb, or Mount Pisgah, or something of that sort. Oh, lie is such a queer old&#xD;
gentleman, with such old-fashioned antediluvian notions. One would think&#xD;
that he had just come out of the wanderings of the children of Israel, and had&#xD;
got into the world 'of our time by mistake. I beat him on the name of the&#xD;
villa. ,I dated all my letters from Sea Lodge, and I had a signboard put up&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6242-00000008"/>&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
with Sea Lodge on it, and now everybody calls it Sea Lodge, and he can't help&#xD;
himself. He has given in, however; he found the word lodge just a little bit&#xD;
Biblical-a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, you know. And that is just about&#xD;
it, for he does garden it away in a .most extravagant manner, and we do have&#xD;
an abundance of cucumber vines, and the place isn't an enchanted palace, nor&#xD;
a castle of chivalry, nor anything very scrumptious. Now don't bother your&#xD;
head about the word scrumptious; it just means sumptuous, I suppose. You&#xD;
will like Uncle Wetherel; he will exactly suit your tastes. That is, you will&#xD;
like him if you are not afraid of him. Don't be afraid of him. I am not. And&#xD;
yet some people are, he is such an old Plymouth Rock of a man, with eyes&#xD;
which are as set and glassy as a ghost's. He is almost eighty years old and as&#xD;
thin and bony as an umbrella. There is nothing of him but a frame and a&#xD;
black cloth covering. I sometimes feel as if I should like to pick him up and&#xD;
open him with a slap, and shut him up again and put him in the umbrella&#xD;
stand.".&#xD;
"Don't!" begged Nestoria, irresistibly tempted to laugh, but feeling that&#xD;
it was wrong, for Mr. Wetherel was old and good. How .could Alice make&#xD;
such fun of her uncle?S&#xD;
"Well, I won't,". answered the irrepressible Alice. "He shan't be put in&#xD;
the umbrella stand if you don't want it. But he is so queer that one can't help&#xD;
having queer plans and projects for him. Can you imagine what he does when&#xD;
he drives out in his phaeton with mamma or me? Every time he finds little&#xD;
boys swearing he pulls up this old poke of a horse and reproves the little ras-&#xD;
cals; and if they keep on at it, he gets out and chases them with his horsewhip.&#xD;
Of course he can't run, and of course they scud away from him, and then&#xD;
swear worse than ever. All the small wretches around here'know him now,&#xD;
and blaspheme him out of his-phaeton as often as they can. I do believe lie&#xD;
has increased the profanity of the township enormously."&#xD;
"Perhaps it is not a judicious way of dealing with bad boys," admitted&#xD;
Nestoria.S&#xD;
Dealing!" repeated Alice, laughingly catching hold of her friend and&#xD;
shaking her. "You dear little primness! did you learn to talk out of the cat-&#xD;
echismP Oh, you will get along famously with Uncle Wetherel. He will say&#xD;
that you talk the language of Zion. Besides, he is all primed to like you; he&#xD;
is fairly addled about missionary people: the forlorn-hope of godliness, he calls&#xD;
them. Your father is a particular admiration of his. I really believe he puts&#xD;
your father alongside of John Bunyan or Jonathan Edwards."&#xD;
Does he?" murmured Nestoria, with a thrill of filial pride which sent the&#xD;
tears into her eyes. "I wish my father could come home and see the kind&#xD;
people who care for him."'&#xD;
" I wish he could," replied Alice, divining the girl's emotion with that sym-&#xD;
pathy which is so quick in woman, and passing an arm around her waist.&#xD;
" We should spoilt him. Well, so much for Uncle Wetherel. He will like you,&#xD;
and you will like him. As for my mother, you know what she is."&#xD;
" Oh, yes," said Nestoria, with a sigh of satisfaction-the sigh of a contented&#xD;
infant. Now tha a lehad a little lost out of mind the mysterious troubles of&#xD;
Edward Wetherel, it was a pure pleasure to her to think that she would shortly&#xD;
meet the good, cordial Mrs. l)inneford.&#xD;
"And that is all," continued Alice. "Uncle Wetherel is a widower, and&#xD;
has lost all his children. No young people except myself; no beaux and no&#xD;
chance of flirtations; no adventures except driving and seat-bathing. We two :&#xD;
women take care of Uncle Wetherel; that is our life. I wish we could have a&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
picnic, or give a dinner now and then. But we mustn't; it costs money&#xD;
Uncle has a million or so, and he spends less than four thousand a year. It&#xD;
seems to me precious mean  I could spend fifty thousand. But then he gives&#xD;
away fifty thousand."&#xD;
He must be a very noble man," judged Nestoria. "The Turks would re-&#xD;
spect such a man."&#xD;
"A lesson for me, I suppose," laughed Alice. " I won't take it; I won't&#xD;
be advised by the Turks; they don't know as much as I do. But of course&#xD;
you must like him. I want you to, for your own sake. I want you to be con-&#xD;
tented with us. One thing more I must tell you. Don't be scared and get&#xD;
faint at his way of carving and helping. He carves, and gets tired and sits&#xD;
down and rests himself, and then tries it again. Then he shies things at you;&#xD;
he takes a piece of beefsteak on the fork and hits it with his knife, and away&#xD;
it goes; you would think a frog was jumping across the table at'you. But he&#xD;
has done it so often that he always hits his mark. It will land on your plate,&#xD;
and not in your lap. . You won't have to wear a baby-apron."&#xD;
After nearly an hour of this prattle, and of such leisurely journeyingrthat&#xD;
Nestoria once looked at the horse to' see if it were not a cow, the rockaway&#xD;
pulled up in front of a red glimmer showing through shrubbery, and the girl&#xD;
perceived that she was at the gate of her new home.&#xD;
The thought which came into her mind at the instant was a wondering&#xD;
query as to what might be the real, fund bhental character of an old gentle-&#xD;
man who could quarrel with his own nephew, and such a gentle, charming,&#xD;
and seemingly altogether admirable nephew as Edward Wetherel.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE MASTER OF SEA LODGE.&#xD;
AT the gate of Sea Lodge Nestoria was welcomed with little less than&#xD;
boisterous gladness by Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
Y       She was a lady of fifty, above the middle height, and of considerable vol..&#xD;
ume, but giving one an idea of solid brawn rather. than of fat, and with a vig-&#xD;
orous style of action - and elocution which betokened strength, and robust&#xD;
health. Her features were irregular and boldly marked, but they beamed un-&#xD;
mistakably with cheerfulness, good nature, and cordiality, and they disclosed&#xD;
lurking symptoms of what seemed unconscious humor.&#xD;
her dress was flying; her handkerchief was fluttering to the ground behind&#xD;
her; her spectacles were holding on to the bridge of her nose with an air of&#xD;
desperation; one hand dragged along the "Puritan Recorder," which she had&#xD;
been reading to Mr. Wetherel; and altogether she had a flurried, windy air, as&#xD;
S of a person descending in a parachute. She was the image of headlong hospi-&#xD;
tality rushing forth to greet a desired guest. The hilarity of welcome in her&#xD;
wide mouth'was not so much a smile as a broad laugh, the preliminary of a&#xD;
somewhat clamorous explosion of kindliness.&#xD;
. .So glad to see you!" she almost shouted, as she caught Nestoria on' the&#xD;
intricate steps of the old-fashioned vehicle and kissed her to the ground.&#xD;
"You come to 'us like a dove out of the ark. One may almost say that you&#xD;
arrive fronm Mount Ararat. I feel like asking you after the prosperity of Fa-&#xD;
ther Noah and his children. What is your last news from your dear good fatherP&#xD;
We have taken his hand so often through the 'Missionary Herald' that we&#xD;
&#xD;
I'll,&#xD;

16                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
all feel as if we had shared his labors and seen his .face. Come straight in.&#xD;
James will attend to your baggage. Alice, run, tell Cousin Wetherel 1iat it is&#xD;
Miss.Bernard. No, never mind; he must know it. How pleased the old gen-&#xD;
tleman will be to see you under his roof-tree. He has looked forward to your&#xD;
coming as if you were the Queen of Sheba. James, unstrap that trunk and be&#xD;
careful not to drop it, and carry it up stairs immediately, will you? How tired&#xD;
you must be! And how we do come together from the ends of the earth and&#xD;
the islands of the sea! The devious ways of the great deep are lighted up by&#xD;
Providence in a way that is wonderful to our eyes. I was just reading a piece&#xD;
in the 'Puritan Recorder' which put me so in mind of you! Bless me, where&#xD;
is that paper? Cousin Wetherel would have a fit if I lost-it. Oh, here it is in&#xD;
my hand; I thought it was my handkerchief. Alice, do look for my handker-&#xD;
chief. It is somewhere- or other, flying all abroad like-how does the hymn&#xD;
go?   And so here you are at last, arrived upon us out of mysteries, safe&#xD;
through a thousand perils. Walk in and see Cousin Wetherel.; Dear me, there&#xD;
the old gentleman is, coming out to meet you. I don't know whether le looks&#xD;
most like one of the ancient kings- of the order of Melchisedek, or like one&#xD;
risen from the dead."'-z&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford talked, like her daughter, with the utmost volubility. In'&#xD;
her haste and glee sheasked question after question without waiting for-an an-&#xD;
swer, and poured out her feelings, her thoughts, and her news in a commingled&#xD;
and ceaseless torrent. Her conversation was the oddest miscellany of com-&#xD;
monplace observations, of Biblical allusions, of whimsical comparisons, and oc-&#xD;
casionally of striking if not absolute poetic fancies. There is no possibility of&#xD;
adequately describing or reporting it.&#xD;
On the front portico of the house, his hair shining like silver under the light&#xD;
of the hall lamp, stood old Mr. Wetherel. He was a man of medium height,&#xD;
but lie seemed tall because of his exceeding leanness, and perhaps he would&#xD;
have been tall but for the stoop in his narrow shoulders. His alpaca clothing&#xD;
blew about him in the light evening breeze as if it draped a mere skeleton. His&#xD;
face was a singularly narrow one; the high, hard, shining forehead was narrow ;&#xD;
the sunken, dusky temples approached each other; the cheek bones were close&#xD;
together; the jaws had no breadth. ' Viewed in profile, this face reminded one&#xD;
of those caricatures which artists sometimes figure in the convex of a crescent&#xD;
moon. A strangely projecting brow looked down over a thin, straight nose at&#xD;
a strangely projecting chin. The expression. of the countenance was grave-&#xD;
even to austerity,'but sweetened by a benevolence of that enduring sort which&#xD;
springs from sense of duty, and lighted now 'and then (if one studied it long&#xD;
enough) by faint glimmers from a humor which an anxious conscience vainly&#xD;
strove to hide under its bush&amp;amp;. '&#xD;
Mr. Wetherel did not advance to meet Nestoria. It would undoubtedly&#xD;
have been a task of some little difficulty for him to descend the steps. But as&#xD;
his guest reached his po t of audience he put forth a thin, wrinkled, hand,&#xD;
grasped her plump and soft one with a hospitable firmness, and, looking&#xD;
searchingly, steadfastly iiito her face, said in a tremulous, yet clear voice, and&#xD;
with impressive deliberation,  I am glad-and honored--to receive under my&#xD;
roof the daughter of the great-and GOOD-Doctor Bernard-whom Heaven&#xD;
bless! If that light among the dark places of the earth had himself come hith-&#xD;
er, I would have gone forth to meet him, as the brethren of Rome went to&#xD;
meet Paul.- Is he well ?".&#xD;
This singular speech, so unworldly in diction and feeling, was uttered with&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         I-&#xD;
' patriarchal simplicity and sincerity of manner. There was no affectation&#xD;
about it, and not the slightest consciousness of cant. The man had so con-&#xD;
stantly read the Bible, he had so closely identified his sentiments with the faith&#xD;
of the Bible, that whenever he felt strongly his languag- was naturalyBibli-&#xD;
cal. There were times, indeed, when he talked in Scriptural style with an ev-&#xD;
ident sense of humor. But that was only in his gayer moments; in such mo-&#xD;
ments of hilarity as would have led other men to joke outright; and even dur-&#xD;
ing these ebullitions he never smiled.&#xD;
"My father was well when I last heard," replied Nestoria.&#xD;
His work is not yet finished," said .Judge -Wetherel. " We are stayed-&#xD;
those of us who are worth staying-until we have wrought our task.&#xD;
,, g .ome&#xD;
in."&#xD;
le wheeled slowly, not pivoting on his heel, but taking little steps in turn-&#xD;
ing, with an obvious care as to keeping his balance,,and marched by her side&#xD;
into the' house. His gait was much like his utterance ; it was deliberate, mo-&#xD;
notonous, and solemn. Even among the calm people of the East Nestoria had&#xD;
never seen any human being of such gravity and staidness. A ljevirential&#xD;
imagination than hers might have amused itself with the idea that the old gen-&#xD;
tieman vent by clockwork and was wound upto valk, speak, and think j&#xD;
so:   fastad no faster. A circumstance, byf the way which added much to his&#xD;
air of stifrness, was a high, old-fashioned black stock, which completely hid his&#xD;
emaciated neck, and seemed to be the only support of his head. This head he&#xD;
turned rarely to right or left, frequently addressing people wiut looking at&#xD;
them, or bringing himself to face them by slowly wheeling his whole body, as&#xD;
if he were a battalion changing front to o en fire. It was with his eyes set&#xD;
straight before him that he carried on a con ersation with Nestoria as he es-&#xD;
corted her'into his parlor.&#xD;
"Miss Bernard," he continued, in his deliberate monoton  yincing slowly&#xD;
and with frequent halts, like an army under a cautious gen  if I were an&#xD;
Oriental, I suppose I should say to you that this house and a at is in it are&#xD;
yours. A I am  an Occidental and a descendant of the exact-speaking Puri-&#xD;
tasa tanthurer hele      dto utter strictly what I mean, I will simply&#xD;
say that you are weleonm to stay in this house as long as I live."&#xD;
wItrustthat that would mean for a long time," replied Nestoria with hon&#xD;
"Thtt is -speaking like an Oriental,"&#xD;
h ais i  itheastins egravely -emarked Judge Wetherel.&#xD;
SWhat kindness the  easterns, feel they also feel at liberty to butter."&#xD;
I aI so really and deeply obliged to you for your invitation!" added the&#xD;
r- girl." I shall want to stay with you a long while."&#xD;
. -  "With the ,permission of Divine Providence you shall," declared the old&#xD;
man. The child of God's apostle to his ancient church in the Kurdish moun-&#xD;
tains shall be a member of my family as long as she chooses to be."&#xD;
"But I t st not stay here a very great while," said Nestoria. "My father&#xD;
told that Iinust not live an idle life in America. I have studies to com-&#xD;
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might," repeated the&#xD;
JudTe. "But until the hour of labor comes, repose here."&#xD;
pThey had now reached a small and plainly furnished bu profusely lighted&#xD;

and gazed at her intently&#xD;
"Do you look like your father? " he asked, after a pause.&#xD;

[8                   THE WETHpREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"I do not," said Nestoria. " My father says that I look as my mother did&#xD;
at my age."&#xD;
"I wish that you resembled your father," was the response of the Judge,&#xD;
who seemed a little disappointed.&#xD;
"Why, Cousin Wetherel, what do you mean? " burst in Mrs. Dinneford,&#xD;
who had just bustled into the room, having been engaged in' worrying James&#xD;
about the trunk. "Don't you think she looks well enough ? How could any.&#xD;
body want her to be different?"&#xD;
Cousin Wetherel. saw, as clearly as Mrs. Dinneford did, that the damsel, as&#xD;
he would have phrased it,.was comely. But he would sooner have been smit-&#xD;
ten on the mouth than have permitted himself to tell her of the fact. In his&#xD;
belief beauty was a snare, and the consciousness of the possession of it ruin.&#xD;
Without moving his head he turned his eyes upon his relative with an air of&#xD;
reproof and quietly answered, "She is a  - God made her, and it is enough. 1&#xD;
was merely anxious to know somewhat concerning the physica appearance of&#xD;
her ather."&#xD;
"Well, so am I," cheerfully declared Mrs. Dinneford, not in the least&#xD;
abashed or hurt by her reprimand, and in fact too busy with her own thinkints&#xD;
to notice it. " It is a great satisfaction certainly to become acquainted with&#xD;
the outward man and similitude of good people who have been blessed to (10a&#xD;
great work in the world. I should like to know the appearance of Moses ben&#xD;
Samuel and Isaiah. and the rest of the old worthies. They must have been&#xD;
delightful to look upon, each after his fashion. You know what I'upper says,&#xD;
'There is a beauty of the spirit-mind in its perfect flowering.' I quote Tupper&#xD;
Just as much as ever, Miss Bernard. Cousin Wetherel sometimes reproves&#xD;
me for it; 'he says I seem to put Tupper above the Bible; andhoindeed, I dont&#xD;
put him far behind. Tupper is so elevated and philosophical, and such a&#xD;
-painter of character! Just hear this now: 'There is  a beauty of the reason,&#xD;
grandlyindependent of externals; it looketh from the windows of the house,&#xD;
shining in the man triumphant.' Don't you seem to see St. Paul in that? He&#xD;

TElW WETHEREL AFFAIR.                '&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE JUDGE'S MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.&#xD;
III catechism concerning Edward Wetherel did not come hastily. The&#xD;
'J.Told Judge, following up the matter in his own deliberate fashion, as if&#xD;
to give himself time for meditation and prayer over it, (lid not speak of the&#xD;
young man to Nestoria for a day or two. Perhaps his intent was that she&#xD;
should learn to look upon him as a friend before she was summoned to accept&#xD;
him as a mentor. A'dictatorial' soul by nature, and c Paile of being very&#xD;
grimly authoritative under a consciousness of duty, so that he was an absolute&#xD;
terror' to all evil-doers whom circumstances placed under his thumb, he had at&#xD;
the sine time a most mellow streak of considei-ate, old-fashioned courtesy in&#xD;
him, and knew how to be gentleness itself with the gentle.&#xD;
"{ A Christian," he was accustomed to say, "ought to be the most perfect&#xD;
gentleman on earth; " and in his secret heart he could ndt help feeling that this&#xD;
rule was especially binding on Wetherels. All his ancestors, as far back as&#xD;
the (lays of the Mayflower. had been not only Puritans, but Puritans of good&#xD;
social position and of high breeding. In spite of his earnest yearnings after a&#xD;
humble spirit, he was proud of his lescent from such men; and because of&#xD;
this pride he considered .himself bound to emulate their graces and virtues.&#xD;
Furthermore, his judicial mind, partly the gift of nature and partly the result&#xD;
of a long habit of examining both sides of weighty questions, enabled or rather&#xD;
a   forced him to be deliberate, considerate, and delicate even in matters which&#xD;
concerned his strong prejudices.&#xD;
Thus for two days the missionary's daughter had an opportunity to study in&#xD;
perfect peace the ordinaryjlife of this household. -Had she belonged to the&#xD;
class of persons whom Judge Wetherel stigmatized as worldlings (looking&#xD;
upon them as more guilty and pitiable than the outright heathen), she would&#xD;
ha   found that life either dismally irksome or whimsically amusing. When&#xD;
she went to bed she discovered on her dressing table a little congregation of&#xD;
the publications of the American Tract Society, with a Bible officiating as cler-&#xD;
gyian, and a hymn-book as chorister; and a tour of inspection.through the&#xD;
house wouldhave revealed the fact that every other dressing-table, gentle or&#xD;
simple, wias provided with -a similar library; so that, if devotional books have&#xD;
any soporific gift, the Judge's retainers and guests had no excuse for lying&#xD;
awake. Indeed, Edward Wetherel was accustomed to say in his light and fab-&#xD;
ulous manner that he could not lodge' at his uncle's without catching cold, be-&#xD;
cause these composing volumes always caused him to snooze off in his chair&#xD;
and 'pass the night without sufficient covering.&#xD;
At half-past six in the morning, as virtuously brisk and punctual as&#xD;
early bird that catches the worm, a servant mnaid skipped through the house,&#xD;
and, applying her knuckles to every bedroom door, pecked up the- slumberer&#xD;
.within. If Alice or her mother-b~oth dilatory persons, and occasionally averse&#xD;
to duties--proffered any remonstrance against the clamor, this maid, by the&#xD;
Judge's express orders, put her mouth to the keyhole and said in a monoto-&#xD;
&#xD;

20                    THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
nous, official tone, " Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be&#xD;
wise."&#xD;
An hour later, precisely at half-past. seven, the old gentleman entered his&#xD;
parlor, marched with the deliberation and gravity of a procession up to a large&#xD;
Bible which occupied a table by itself, took it deferentially in his meagre arms,&#xD;
seated himself, opened the book upon his knees, wiped his spectacles, and rang&#xD;
:a little bell. This bell, by the way, was of bronze; and when Alice once sub-&#xD;
stituted for it a silver one which she had bought with her own money, her&#xD;
grave relative put it aside and called for the plainer instrument; at the same&#xD;
time remarking, with his characteristic solemn humor, that silver was a noble&#xD;
metal and worthy of the New Jerusalem, but brass was good enough to call&#xD;
sinners together.&#xD;
It was expected thatsat the sound of this bell, all the family, including the&#xD;
domestics, should appear immediately. If one lingered, that one was sent for;&#xD;
but meanwhile the Judge showed no annoyance or even impatience; he waited&#xD;
in solemn silence and with an air of abstracted meditation; his sunken, glassy&#xD;
eyes were never lifted from the sacred page. On the advent of the loiterer he&#xD;
invariably said, " The king's business requires haste," and then proceeded with&#xD;
his service.&#xD;
To save Nestoria from the chance of this reproof, Mrs. Dinneford went to&#xD;
her room on the first morning of her visit. To her great satisfaction she found&#xD;
the girl dressed and i-eady.&#xD;
" How do you do, my dear?" she said, with a kiss. "I hope you slept the&#xD;
sleep of youth and health. You must have been as tired as a little bird when&#xD;
he first tries his wings. Have you looked at this glorious sea this morning?&#xD;
The sun is shining on it like the sun of Austerlitz. It must remind you of&#xD;
your native mountains."&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford always had so much to say, and was moved to say it in such&#xD;
a hurry, that she was frequently not a little vague and dislocated in discourse,&#xD;
leaving her connections of thought to be guessed at. The association, for in-&#xD;
stance, of the Kurdish mountains with Long Island Sound, strikes one as loose.&#xD;
"nut .I am so glad you slept," she ran on. "Young people, and old peo-&#xD;
ple too, for that matter, don't always rest well in ; new place. We human&#xD;
creatures are a little like cats; we get along best in our own garrets. And it is&#xD;
even so in matters of religion; many people can't worship God except in their&#xD;
own church; indeed, it's wonderful how many cat Christians there are. As&#xD;
my excellent and wise friend Tupper says, 'We are frail, and governed by&#xD;
externals.' But I am so glad now you are all ready. I was a little afraid you&#xD;
might have overslept, in spite of those spirit-rappings that worry us up of&#xD;
mornings. You must, know that Cousin Wetherel is very particular about&#xD;
promptness at family prayers; and I just ran up to see that you didn't fail, and&#xD;
made a good impression'upon him the first morning. Well, we'll go down&#xD;
now; there's the prayer bell. It's just like a college or a church, isn't it?&#xD;
Dear me, how much bell-metal has had to do with Christianity. I sometimes&#xD;
wonder how the faith would have been spread if bronze had never been in-&#xD;
vented. . As some Frenchman has said, everything has to be advertised, even&#xD;
religion; and though he may not have said it in the most respectful spirit, nev-&#xD;
ertheless there's some truth in it. The deaf ears of this world have to be as-&#xD;
sailed in all sorts of ways to make them hear; and bell-rimgng is only another&#xD;
kind of crying aloud in the waste places. It is one of the indirect influences&#xD;
that Tupper speaks of;. you know he says, 'Hints shrewdly strown mightily dis-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR..                       21&#xD;
turb the spirit.' Well, we shall find Cousin Wetherel all ready for us, with his&#xD;
Bible on his knees. He won't look at you,{but don't mind that. He never en-&#xD;
t   ters upon the conversation of the day until, as he says, he has invoked Ileav-&#xD;
9ns blessing upon it.. Prayer before speech and thanks before food, is one of&#xD;
his mottoes. There is Alice now. Alice, come and speak to Nestoria while&#xD;
you have a' chance. You see, child, we don't follow Cousin Wetherel's pre-&#xD;
cepts. We talk at all times, in season and out of season, and sometimes, per-&#xD;
haps, without a blessing upon it; or if there is one, it comes by good luck and&#xD;
no merit of ours. Talking seems to be our mission. It's just as natural to us&#xD;
as rattling to a wagon."&#xD;
During this speech Nestoria had several times tried in vain to make answer.&#xD;
She had sought to say that she had slept well, that she had admired the sun-&#xD;
light on the sea, that she had thought of her native mountains, and that she&#xD;
thanked Mrs. Dinneford for calling her. But the fluency of the elder lady per-&#xD;
petually submerged her, and she had not been able to get a whole sentence to&#xD;
the surface.&#xD;
She now exchanged a kiss and a little hurried whispering with Alice; and&#xD;
then they were in the parlor in the solemnizing presence of Judge Wetherel. As&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford had predicted, he did not address his visitor on her entrance,&#xD;
and his glassy eyes remained fixed upon his Bible. The servants, an elderl&#xD;
English coachman, a still more venerable cook of the female gender and Amer-&#xD;
ican stock, and an Irish Protestant chambermaid of thirty, who had all been&#xD;
respectfully waiting the arrival of their betters, now came in and took seats by&#xD;
Rc door. Only when perfect silence and quiet had been 'established did the&#xD;
Judge commence his'devotions. Lifting his eyes for the first time in two min-&#xD;
utes, he turned them slowly from face to face, and uttered in his tremulous&#xD;
monotone the following words:&#xD;
" My Christian friends, unworthy as we all are of such mercy, our Creator&#xD;
has permitted us once more to look upon each other, and to ,join in returning&#xD;
thanks for undeserved blessings. I-shall now read'a portion of this Holy Word&#xD;
which was revealed to us as a guide whereby we might reach a better and hap-&#xD;
pier life. If wisdom seems to be given me, I will endeavor to speak a word or&#xD;
two of interpretation; and if I seem to you to pass any dark places without&#xD;
ptoper note, I pray that you will deliver your miiids thereupon, aid if you can-&#xD;
not shed light at least shed darkness; for the exhibition of darkness may lead&#xD;
to a correction of light."&#xD;
He then read, very slowly, the eleventh chapter of Ihebrews, pausing occ-&#xD;
sionally to utter brief comments, some of the ordinary type of Biblical exege-&#xD;
sis, and others of an originality which bordered on humor. But whatever his&#xD;
thougits might have been, his Countenance remained grave; not even a comic&#xD;
incident could ruffie the icy surface of its solemnity. After le had read of the&#xD;
faith of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, etc., he paused over the inquiry, "And&#xD;
=    what shall I more say?"  Here the elderly cook, who took it that this was a&#xD;
question of Judge Wetherel's own asking,.and that lie was hard bested to an-&#xD;
swer it, came to his relief.&#xD;
"Say?" lie repeated in a prompt, confident treble; "why, say they were&#xD;
good men amt ought to go to heaven."&#xD;
Sarah,' tranquilly remarked the old man, "there is a wisdom which is&#xD;
profl~tab~le " and continued his readiing.&#xD;
Sarah, obtusely conscious of approval, glanced cheerfully at her juniors in&#xD;
domestic travail, and then, curbing her spiritual pride, bent her loose eyes&#xD;
&#xD;

22                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
upon the floor. A sparkle of' amusement danced under Mrs. Dinneford's&#xD;
lashes, and the r.attleheaded Alice barely prevented a smile. Nestoria, educated&#xD;
in habits of the profoundest respect for devotional matters, exhibited not the&#xD;
slightest change of countenance. Nor was she at all diverted when a sportive&#xD;
kitten mounted the Judge's back while he was on his knees, and played with&#xD;
the silver locks which hung over his high coat collar. The old gentleman,&#xD;
too, was equally indifferent to the feline disturbance; he touched upon all his&#xD;
customary "topics " with his customary deliberation.&#xD;
At last the service ended; the Judge rose with effort to his feet; and now&#xD;
he allowed himself to salute his guest.&#xD;
"Miss Bernard," he said, walking composedly up to her and taking one of&#xD;
her hands in both his, "I am rejoiced to see you at my altar and by my hearth.&#xD;
Let me trust that the daughter of that servant of God, Doctor Bernard, will&#xD;
make herself at home in a family which fervently admires ber father.. I will&#xD;
not say this again. I am sure it will not be necessary."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear family prayers once more," said Nestoria. "Of course&#xD;
I have always been accustomed to them. It puts me at home at once."&#xD;
There was no tone of cant about this declaration, nor did the girl utter it to&#xD;
please her company. ,She spoke with the utmost naturalness, and with unpre-&#xD;
meditated sincerity. It had seemed to her while listening to the Judge's peti-&#xD;
tion that she was once more in her childhood's home, and the power of remi-&#xD;
niscence that there is in familiar words and feelings had deeply moved an af-&#xD;
fectionate, lonely heart.&#xD;
Mr. Wetherel showed no sign of emotion in his wrinkled, imperturbable,&#xD;
countenance, but he walked slowly over to Mrs. Dinneford and whispered in&#xD;
her ear, "She will find herself at home in Paradise."&#xD;
The utterance was so sublimely unworldly, and its enthusiasm was such a&#xD;
matter of surprise as coming from the grave Judge, that for a moment Mrs.&#xD;
Dinneford's soul was loftily shaken, and she could have found kindly pleasure&#xD;
in.crying.&#xD;
"Uncle Wetherel, did you feel the cat on your back at prayers?" put in the&#xD;
jovial.Alice. "I would give a sixpence to know what you thought."&#xD;
"I was reminded to pray specially against the temptations of Satan," an-&#xD;
swered the old man. "Not that the cat can be a satanic'incarnation, as our&#xD;
worthy ancestors were suffered to believe. But wanderings of mind in devo-&#xD;
tion, resulting from no matter what cause, are diabolic. We must resist them."&#xD;
Having dropped this insidious reproof, which Alice, by the way, took no&#xD;
profitable note of, he proceeded to breakfast.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
THE CONVERSE OF TWO YOUNG LADIES;. OR, A WISE, AND FOOLISH VIRGIN.&#xD;
AFTER a long grace, uttered in a standing postlire, the Judge fell to his&#xD;
carving.&#xD;
He stood up to this duty also, for in a sitting position he would have been&#xD;
no match for the broiled chicken, and -even with the aid of avoirdupois his&#xD;
trembling hands did their work slowly. Now and then an involuntary grimace&#xD;
indicated his physical weakness, or perhaps betrayed some dolor of old age.&#xD;
Over one tough joint lie paused for some time, meanwhile talking composedly,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL ,AFFAIR.                         23&#xD;
knife and fork in hand. His, subject was'the missionary work in general, and&#xD;
that of Doctor Bernard in particular.&#xD;
"The goings and comings of the truth on this dark earth are wonderful,"&#xD;
lhe bserved. "The revolutions of the light of the soul are like the revolutions&#xD;
of day and night. When our savage ancestors were still worshipping Thor&#xD;
and Odin, the Nestorians had long.since been keepers of the faith. And now&#xD;
we, having received it into our Anglo-Saxon minds from the East, are per-&#xD;
mitted and commissioned to carry it back to the East. But what can you tell&#xD;
me of the Kurds? Are they the descendants of the ancient Carduchians? "&#xD;
"My father thinks so, and I believe every one in the mission does," replie&#xD;
Nestoria, as coniposed as the sublime 0d gentleman himself, and not once&#xD;
glancing at her'empty plate, although very hungry.&#xD;
" So," continued the Judge, "the same ferocious people who annoyed the&#xD;
treatt of the Ten Thousand have in these days impeded the labors of our&#xD;
saints and inassacred their disciples. I am not a man of war, but of -peace,"&#xD;
he-continued, with something like smothered indignation; " yet ani I tempted&#xD;
to wish that the Nestorians had had somewhat of the Greek discipline, and a&#xD;
Christian Xenophon to direct it. However, the Creator knows what is best&#xD;
for his Church, -It becomes us to wait his labor in reverent silence."&#xD;
Having reposed himself during this dialogue, Mr. Wetherel resumed his&#xD;
attack upon the broiled chicken, treating it with some such severe vigor as if it&#xD;
represented- a Kurd, and by dint of much "bearing on" .eventually getting the&#xD;
better of it. Other eccentricities, even more notable than his manner of carv-&#xD;
ing, were forthcoming. Like many elderly persons, he had dropped sdn e of&#xD;
the prmidial courtesies of his prime and returned to the simpler manners of&#xD;
his childhood. le preferred to help his guests directly, rather than tarry for&#xD;
the slow plate-bearing of the waiter girl, who, by the way, was the chamber-&#xD;
maid. Once he accomplished the difficult feat attributed to him by Alice,&#xD;
namely "skippilig1" a bit of chicken across the table from his carving-fork and&#xD;
lodging it dexterously on Mrs. Dinneford's plate. Another performance con- .&#xD;
sisted in taking a slice of bread in his fingers and tossing it over his shoulder&#xD;
into the grate, 'This seenied to be so entirely irrational, unless indeed it were&#xD;
some ki d f ceremonial akin to the pouting out of libations, that Nestoria was&#xD;
s  lost in stonishument.&#xD;
Fri     " C)usin Wetherel!" laughed Mrs. Dinneford. "You forget that there is&#xD;
no-" fire."&#xD;
"Mrs..Dinneford, I stand corrected," replied the Judge with monumental&#xD;
composure. "Ellen, carry that piece of bread into the kitchen and toast it."&#xD;
" Take a fresh slice,?' suggested Mrs. Dinneford. " That isn't fit."&#xD;
It is good enough for an aged sinner who 'can't remember whether it is&#xD;
summer or winter," affirmed the Judge.&#xD;
"Cousin Wetherel prefers to toast his own bread," explained Mrs. Dinne-&#xD;
forgl to Nestoria. "lHe wants to make sure that it shall be burnt to a coal."&#xD;
" At my age a man must how to his stomach," added the old gentleman.&#xD;
"lIe must say lihumbly to that organ, What will your highness please to digest?&#xD;
It is a hard and low master. I serve it while I despise it."&#xD;
" You ought to read Tupper on ' Hidden Uses,' " remarked Mrs. Dinueford,&#xD;
".He has some noble thoughts on the value of things which seem to be of no&#xD;
worth."&#xD;
"Whien I have exhausted Solomon I will turn my attention to Tupper,''&#xD;
answered the Judge with sedate scorn.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6242-00000013"/>&#xD;
24                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"Well, do give Nestoria another bit of chicken," put in Alice. "She has&#xD;
nothing to eat."&#xD;
"Miss Bernard, you must pardon my spectacled purblindness," apologized&#xD;
the descenidant of many Wetherels.  ' "I may say that I see you through a glass&#xD;
darkly."&#xD;
Not only the Judge's ideas and manners, but also his turns of speech, were&#xD;
original. But his obvious sincerity of character, his venerable age, and even&#xD;
his physical feebleness lent a dignity to all his peculiarities, and made him a&#xD;
patriarchal figure. Nestoria was not in the .least disposed to laigh at lhim;&#xD;
she regardedhim with a respect which did her honor; for in truth he was&#xD;
worthy of respect. It must be observed in passing that lie bore, a graver&#xD;
aspect at table than was usual with him. "A meal," he was accustomed to&#xD;
say, "should be looked upon as a species of solemn ceremonial, inasmuch as&#xD;
it is a celebration of a fresh grant of undeserved mercies." Thus when he&#xD;
rose from breakfast it was with a more lightsome, face than he had worn&#xD;
hitherto..&#xD;
ll" Now, Miss Bernard,. a duty is over," he said cheerfully. "How shall we&#xD;
spend the day ?"&#xD;
"I should like to do something for you, sir," replied Nestoria.&#xD;
"I am sincerely obliged to you for the desire," bowed the Judge, with the&#xD;
solemn courtesy of a gentleman of the old'school. "But my .needs in the way&#xD;
of amusement are few. Let me urge you to think of yourself. You can drive.&#xD;
I have but one horse, and Jelmi would not have given a shekel of brass for&#xD;
him, but he answers our purpose. He is usually gracious enough to take out&#xD;
Alice in the morning, and myself with Mrs. Dinneford in the afternoon. Some,&#xD;
day, when it is agreeable to you, you can go with me. I should take it as a&#xD;
pleasure."&#xD;
Of course Nestoria replied that it would also be a pleasure to her; and&#xD;
although the answer was a courtesy, it was not the less uttered in sincerity.&#xD;
Generously sympathetic by nature, and educated in ways of self-abnegation by&#xD;
parents whose life had been a continuous self-sacrifice, she had grown up with&#xD;
a disposition to fill the cup of others rather than her own; so that, however&#xD;
dull a drive with Mr. Wetherel might have seemed to her imagination, she&#xD;
would have'found a sort'of dutiful satisfaction in driving with him across the&#xD;
continent, had he declared for such a -recreation. But, more than that, she&#xD;
really liked the society of elderlypersons, for the reason that she was accus-&#xD;
tomed to it.- Infants had not swarmed into the ark of the Nestorian mission;&#xD;
and of the few who had been vouchsafed to it some had died promptly, and&#xD;
others had been sent in good time to America; while with the native youth&#xD;
of the land she had not been allowed to associate freely, for fear of evil com-&#xD;
munications. Thus nearly all the people whom she had known familiarly&#xD;
during her childhood and girlhood had been many years older than herself,&#xD;
while the gravity of their pursuits and character made them seem  even&#xD;
older than they were. We need not wonder therefore that she should look&#xD;
upon the venerable Judge as a. suitable comrade, and should be able to say&#xD;
to him honestly that. she should like very much to share his phaetonic ad-&#xD;
ventures.     .       .&#xD;
I must admit here'that such an old-minded young lady seems at first sight&#xD;
to be hardly a taking heroine. The ordinary healthful soul may be pardoned&#xD;
for suspecting that she must have been a little hypocrite or an unnatural little&#xD;
prig. But those who knew her ways best and were allowed to see deepest into&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         25&#xD;
her heart did not think her either. There was not a bit of affectation or of any&#xD;
manner of pretence in her demeanor or in her character. She was as natural&#xD;
as a bird; and all you could say against her was that she had been brought up&#xD;
in a cage instead of the wildwood freedom of a nest; and even if you chose to&#xD;
add that it was a pity, you had to concede that she was not to blame. It&#xD;
would have been dreadful, to be shrie, if her convent-like education had crushed&#xD;
out of her those instinctive emotions which form one of the chiefest charms and&#xD;
one of the purest joys of youth; and we must admit that, had that been the&#xD;
case, the girl would not have been attractive. But the events of this story will&#xD;
show that Nestoria was not deficient in feelings, and that she could be led by&#xD;
them to do things which a more worldly-wise young lady might have recoiled&#xD;
from; experience in perils being oftenest the parent of prudence.&#xD;
Returning now to the course of our story, we will state the commonplace,&#xD;
composing fact that Alice and Nestoria dIrove out together, perambulating&#xD;
such a wide extent of sandy coast country that Old Sorrel twice came to a halt&#xD;
in dumb remonstrance.&#xD;
"Get up!" screamed Alice, twitching at the reins. "I declare I believe&#xD;
he is going to1lie down. Such a horse! Uncle ought to have a spanking span,&#xD;
and a fine carriage and a regular coachman. And here lie keeps this old fatty,&#xD;
and James hoes potatoes! If I had a million, wouldn't I make it fly! What&#xD;
a breakfast that was! Did you ever see the like"&#xD;
" A great deal worse," answered Nestoria.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, on missionary ground. But poor breakfasts are quite appro-&#xD;
priate there, just to teach the heathen not to he greedy. Rich people at home&#xD;
should spend their money."&#xD;
JTo teach the missionaries not to be greedy ?" asked Nestoria;&#xD;
Alice laughed. "You are awful clever sometimes," she confessed. "You&#xD;
look so demure, and all of a sudden you say something cunning, and it aston-&#xD;
ishes people. It strikes one as if a rabbit or a chicken had made a joke. How-&#xD;
ever, I wasn't complaining of the quality or quantity of the breakfast; there is&#xD;
enough to eat on uncle's table, and it is generally good enough. I meant the&#xD;
grimness and the queer behaving. I do'so hate grimness and queer behaving.&#xD;
Did you see that chicken wing fly P It couldn't have done better if it had been&#xD;
alive and had all its feathers. I expected to hear'it cackle cut-cut-ca-da-cut.&#xD;
4   I hate such fashions."&#xD;
"Don't you think your uncle is a very good man ?" asked Nestoria, quietly&#xD;
remonstrating against this light-minded and unfair criticism.&#xD;
"Good? ,I guess he is. Too good. Think of his giving awny fifty thou-&#xD;
sand a year to charities and Bible societies and that sort of thing. It puts me&#xD;
out of all patience. .I would like a five hundred dollar dress, and a five hun-&#xD;
dred dollar brooch, and a thousand dollar shawl, and so on. But he gives me&#xD;
nothing unless it isnvow and then some solemn book. le says I have enough&#xD;
.moneyof my own for vanities."&#xD;
And haven't you?" asked the missionary's daughter, glancing at Alice's&#xD;
coral earrings. The glance, we must explain, was not one of austere reproof,&#xD;
nor of greed, or envy, or jealousy. The girl frankly admired the earrings,&#xD;
taking a heartfelt, natu al pleasure in their shapely form and rich color, and&#xD;
simply marvelling that uch luxury could feel discontent.&#xD;
"No," declared Agee. " What girl. ever did have enoughP Well, I&#xD;
mustn't complain ; it is father ungrateful. I suppose uncle means to leave us&#xD;
a gr at deal of money.'&#xD;

26                   THE WETIIEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
" And won't he leave anything to-?"  Nestoria began the sentence eager-&#xD;
ly, but she did not finish it.&#xD;
" To whom? " stared Alice.&#xD;
" I thought he had a nephew," said Nestoria, coloring over her speech, but&#xD;
conscientiously bound to be frank.&#xD;
The garrulous Alice turned discreet in presence of the family skeleton, and&#xD;
merely replied, " So he has-I don't know."&#xD;
"We are lucky," she presently added, unable to repress entirely her con-&#xD;
municaitive nature. " The Judge is not my own uncle; he is only. mamma's&#xD;
first cousin. But he has taken a great fancy to us. It is one of his whimsies.&#xD;
I am sure I don't know why lie should like me, such a piece as I am."&#xD;
Perhaps he trusts you will come to resemble your mother," suggested&#xD;
Nestoria.&#xD;
Thank'you." laughed Alice. "Mother is nice enough, and I don't object&#xD;
to being like her, when the time comes."&#xD;
But -we Must not spend too much space upon the talk of these girls; we&#xD;
must hasten on to the more momentous drive of Nestoria with the Judge. The&#xD;
old man haid proposed the expedition in order that he might he alone with his&#xD;
youthful guest and catechise her as to the extent of her intimacy with his_&#xD;
nephew, and perhaps say a word in season concerning so perilous an acquaint-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
A FRIENDLY WARNING.&#xD;
IT was five o'clock in the afternoon when the Judge and Nestoria set out on&#xD;
their progress through the sandy byways of the shore.&#xD;
The old man drove in a leisurely fashion, according to his octogenari( cus-'&#xD;
torn, talking much to his beast in a remonstrative tone, using the lsl . rely&#xD;
and at regular intervals, as if it were a matter of stated duty, and apply1fg it&#xD;
even' then in a perfunctory, ceremonial, and not altogether sincere manner.&#xD;
Old Sorrel took his own gait; when admonished, he went a little slower, as if&#xD;
to listen; when whipped, he whisked his tail over the spot, under a pretence of&#xD;
brushing off flies; if he came within reach of a thicket, he made a bite at a tuft&#xD;
of leaves, and left off trotting to munch; if he discovered a hill a quarter of a&#xD;
mile ahead of him, he prepared himself for it by falling into a walk; in short,&#xD;
he showed that he was a dilatory, obstinate, and self-seeking old quadruped.&#xD;
"Sorrel is not- event a good eye-servant," remarked the Judge. "le&#xD;
evades his due labor under, my very spectacles."&#xD;
"lHe can go faster," said Nestoria, remembering how Alice.had got the an-&#xD;
cient shirk over the ground.&#xD;
"ie can, but why should lie?" answered Mr. Wetherel. "We shall get&#xD;
home to tea, and he knows it. What is time to an old man like me? Hardly&#xD;
more than to an old horse like him, Time, Miss Bernard, is chiefly of value in&#xD;
our youth, when we still have strength to improve it. ,One of the soirowfulest&#xD;
things of my present age is the thought that my days are now of less worth&#xD;
than they were to my fellow creatures. The Creator is divinely right in re-&#xD;
moving the old to niake place for the young-.,&#xD;
"1i wonder if I shall ever' work," queried Nestoria. " My father," she&#xD;
added, uttering the word in a charming tone of reverence and belie, "my&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR..                        27&#xD;
father warned me that I should be exposed to one great temptation in Amer-&#xD;
ica. He said that you good people at home spoil missionaries' children. You&#xD;
pet them and support them, he said, and so make them shamefully lazy. Now,&#xD;
Mr. Wetherel, are you going to spoil me? Don't you know that I ought to be&#xD;
set at work?"&#xD;
"And what shall we set you at?" inquired the Judge, who was not in the&#xD;
eastinelined to put his shoulder to this duty, and had evei dallied with a tem -&#xD;
tation to-dower the girl out of his own riches.&#xD;
Couldn't I help in a school? I might teach painting, as well as other&#xD;
things. I learned to paint fans from the lady who entertained me in London."&#xD;
Do you never mean to go back to your father? " asked the old man, who&#xD;
considered missionary work the noblest labor possible to mortals.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, when I am tit for it; but my eduic:ition isn't completed, you&#xD;
know; and my character isn't formed-so my father says. Yes, I suppose I&#xD;
shall go back in a few years," she added dreamily, while an unbidden query&#xD;
came into her mind as to whether she would go with a husband, and whether&#xD;
Edward Wetherel      But here she promptly checked her imagination; she&#xD;
must not thmil so seriously of a man who had said so little to her that was se-&#xD;
rious; a man, too, who eight not be as good as she hoped he was; who might&#xD;
even be what she called " an unbeliever."&#xD;
"And in the mean time you desire to study'and also to work," said the&#xD;
Judge with an approving nod. "V9ry good. It niust all he lone, But there&#xD;
is time enough. You must abide under iy roof during the vacations. After&#xD;
that we will see."&#xD;
" You must be sure to see," responded Nestoria, with conscientious u-gency&#xD;
{nd woman's dependence.&#xD;
"You spoke of meeting my nephew Edward," continued the old gentle-&#xD;
man, whose undercurrent of thought had all the time been eddying about that&#xD;
dreadful topic. "hIow caie'you to encounter him?"&#xD;
Mir   Nestoria colored brilliantly; it was even a greater subject to her than to&#xD;
her companion ; that name of Edward was the only one that had ever made&#xD;
her heart beat.e                                                m&#xD;
I iet him on the Atlantic steamer," she answered, just a bit suffocated by&#xD;
,wthe cxpllanmation.&#xD;
yIndeed!" exclaimed the Judge, not a little alarmed, for he knew of the&#xD;
youig man's pleasant ways with women. "Then you have seen much of&#xD;
"eYes," said Nestoria, happy in the recollection, and smiling back at those&#xD;
pleasant hours. "le was very, very kind to me. He took me to walk every&#xD;
nmorningand afternoon in rough weather, and it was always rough, at least&#xD;
a little. I should have been much more lonesome without him."&#xD;
"I trust you saw nothing in his walk and conversation but what you&#xD;
could approve," added the old man in a tone of doubt which did not flatter&#xD;
r Edward.&#xD;
No," answered Nestoria frankly and firmly.  Indeed, she had seen a&#xD;
great deal to approve in the said walk and conversation, Had not the young&#xD;
fellow treated her with perfect politeness, and even with charming considera-&#xD;
tion and delicay? Notwi-hst-n-i-g-&#xD;
y? Nwitstanding this mysterious quarrel with his good un-&#xD;
cle, she found it impossible to believe that ie could be very bad, or so much as&#xD;
bad a little.&#xD;
"Isppose he smokes still?" queried the Judge, in a tone which seemed to&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6242-00000015"/>&#xD;
28                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
declare that smoking leads to drinking,.and drinking to murder, and murder-&#xD;
to the gallows, all three-doubtful statements in our day.&#xD;
"Yes," admitted Nestoria. "But is that wrong? Some of the missiona-&#xD;
ries smoke."&#xD;
That is possible," groaned the venerable Puritan, unwillinglyconceding&#xD;
the stumbling fact, and seeking to excuse it to himself'on the plea of Oriental&#xD;
custom. "But at all events they don't drink ale."  -&#xD;
" There isn't any ale," said Nestoria. "However, I don't suppose they&#xD;
would drink it if there was any. They are all teetotallers, I believe."&#xD;
" I trust so," fervently returned the Judge. Then he thought, in the anti-&#xD;
nicotine corner of his earnest soul, What a pity they should smoke! This re-&#xD;
tiection, however, he did not utter; he would not lead the girl to question the&#xD;
goodness of her father's comrades in pious labors; he had his strenuouspreju-,&#xD;
dices, but at times he could be wisely considerate in spite of them. By the&#xD;
way, it seems appropriate to relate here a story, which illustrates the old man's&#xD;
hatred of tobacco;, a hatred so hearty that it could confound his judicial mind&#xD;
and cause him to pronounce judgment without hearing evidence or argument.&#xD;
In a certain grave convocation there had been a question of passing censure&#xD;
upon clerical smokers; whereupon an erring brother of a scientific turn rose&#xD;
to his feet and attempted to demonstrate that, under given circumstances, of&#xD;
habit and constitution, a cigar or so per day would not be injurious, and conse-&#xD;
quently not immoral; whereupon Judge Wetherel made a reply commencing&#xD;
with these memorable and monumental words, more immovable than a sen-&#xD;
tence of pyramids: "Mr. Moderator-I thank Heaven-that on this subject--&#xD;
my -mind is not open to conviction."&#xD;
But we must return to his catechism of Nestoria concerning Edward; he&#xD;
was anxious to know how she happened to meet the young man on the Elm&#xD;
City.&#xD;
"It was just an accident," she said. "lie was coming up this way to a&#xD;
fishing-place.".&#xD;
" What fishing-place?"&#xD;
" le did not tell me. Are there so many?"&#xD;
The Judge was relieved; then there had been no agreement to meet again;&#xD;
there was to be no correspondence; it was not a flirtation. The dove under&#xD;
his roof, the innocent daughter of the "great and good" Doctor Bernard, had&#xD;
not become entangled in the talons of that unclean bird of prey, his reprobate&#xD;
nephew. Their companionship had been a mere transitory acquaintance, and&#xD;
there was no need of asking any painfully searching questions about it, nor of&#xD;
entering into monitory disclosures of the young man's character. Mr. Weth-&#xD;
erel was glad of it, for, like other wise and decorous men, he hated to talk of&#xD;
the skeleton in his closet; and furthermore, he was conscientious as to bearing&#xD;
needless evil witness, even against the ungodly. As long as there was hope&#xD;
of reforming Edward he had withstood him to his face, as he expressed it. in&#xD;
his Biblical way ; and when all such hope had died out of his heart he, had re-s&#xD;
solved to disinherit him, and that was enough. Ile would not, in addition, as&#xD;
perse his name, unless such accusation were needful for the salvation of others.&#xD;
Nestoria put his reticence to the proof. She was anxious to speak of the&#xD;
quarrel, because she longed to put an end to it. At the bottom of her childlike&#xD;
innocence and simplicity there was, a solid foundation of moral courage, which&#xD;
was made up partly of conscious rectitude of intention and partly of a beauti-&#xD;
ful confidence in the goodness and kindliness of her fellow creatures. It was&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR-                          29&#xD;
not unlike the courage of those untaught birds on the shores of rarely visited&#xD;
islands who valk deliberately up to the feet of marvelling explorers.&#xD;
"He told me," she added in a slightly agitated voice, "why he did not come&#xD;
to see you in passing. He said you were not on terms with each other."&#xD;
In spite of the temptation offered by this statement, the old man remained&#xD;
firm to his abjuration of needless evil speaking.&#xD;
"We have not been able to agree," he said gravely, and with honest sor-&#xD;
rowfulness. "It is verge sad that relatives should take such differing, such di-&#xD;
verging paths in life. But we have not been able to agree., May He who is&#xD;
all-wise and all-pitiful have mercy upon him who is in the wrong, be it Ed-&#xD;
ward or myself!"&#xD;
lie said no more; the door to this subject was evidently shut upon hei She&#xD;
had transmitted the young man's apology for passing his relatives by; it was&#xD;
all that she had a right to do.&#xD;
Thus it came about that Nestori was left to live on in ignorance of the na-&#xD;
ture of this quarrel, and even in uncertainty as to which of the two parties to&#xD;
it was in the wrong. Both of them seemed to her altogether lovely in charac-&#xD;
ter, and incapable of truly meriting the other's condemnation. Educated in a&#xD;
little dovecote of piety, far withdrawn from the great world of fashion and dis-&#xD;
sipation, and unaccustomed to see any bad people except such as wore turbans&#xD;
and carried pistols in their sashes, she knew nothing of wild young men except&#xD;
by insufficient report, and had no, manner of skill in detecting them. -She&#xD;
thought that of course they carried the marks of'their wickedness in their per-&#xD;
sons and faces; that their hands were tremulous, their countenances haggard,&#xD;
and their eyes sunken; that their expressions were hideous with evil passions&#xD;
and with the torments of remorse.&#xD;
Now no such shocking stigmat 4 were visible in Edward Wetherel; his form&#xD;
was vigorous, his skin healthfully clear, his look cultured and gentle. Evil&#xD;
had not set its well-known brand upon him, and therefore in her opinion, he&#xD;
could not be the child of evil. The quarrel was a mystery; perhaps it was&#xD;
about some matter of business, inexplicable' to women; perhaps both Edward&#xD;
and his uncle were in some incomprehensible way right. She could not solve&#xD;
the disagreeable puzzle, and for the present she left it in the hands of Provi-&#xD;
dence, trusting that the day of unravelnient would come.&#xD;
'You will find our life very quiet here,"- said the Judge as they drove&#xD;
homeward.&#xD;
And so she did, at least for a time. There was not another country resi-&#xD;
dence within miles of Sea Lodge. A so-called hotel stood near by, indeed, but&#xD;
its inniates and visitors were mainly persons of the ruder if not lewder sort,'&#xD;
and they no more frequented the Judge's house than Canaanites of old infested&#xD;
the schools of'the prophets. In the neighboring city the family had few-ac-&#xD;
quaintances, and those few rarely drove out to render it visits. Sometimes&#xD;
hack loads of singing or yelling revellers clattered by of nights, inciting Mr.&#xD;
Wetherel to repeat Milton's verse concerning "The noisy sons of Belial, -flown&#xD;
with insolence and Wine." 1 But in general Sea Lodge was a refuge of quiet;&#xD;
hearing no clamor but the thump of waves on the beach, and certainly produc-&#xD;
ing no uproar of its own.&#xD;
Nevertheless, Satan was prowling about, as the Judge frequently-asserted;&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
THE JOYS AND SNARES OF MOONLIGHT.&#xD;
"DID you ever see such a dull place!" demanded the sociable Alice, quite&#xD;
ready, we fear, to let Satan into Sea Lodge rather than bear with itsdulness.&#xD;
"Alice, I am perfectly happy," answered Nestoria. "That is, almost,"&#xD;
she added, recollecting certain absent ones whose presence would have made&#xD;
the happiness perfect. "I find every day too short. I hate to go to sleep."&#xD;
"Well, if you are not joyful on the very smallest provocation,! What in&#xD;
the world are you happy for? Because we never do anything? Because we&#xD;
never see anybody? Because we are shut up in an enchanted castle, with Un-&#xD;
cle Wetherel for a magician?"&#xD;
"But we do do something. I have read half of Robinson's 'Syria' to&#xD;
your uncle. I have written twenty pages to my father. We have driven and&#xD;
sailed and walked. I could look all day at the sea,.it is so beautiful and mys-&#xD;
terious. How can you find it dull! You ought to live in a Nestorian village&#xD;
for a few years. It would teach you what sameness is."&#xD;
"Why, my dear little canary bird, I do believe you are scolding," laughed&#xD;
Alice.&#xD;
"Scolding-? "asked Nestoria&#xD;
"At any rate you lectured. It was borne in upon me that I repine without&#xD;
cause. You certainly lectured."&#xD;
"Did I? I mustn't. I am not fit."&#xD;
"Oh, don't be so humble! And do, please, don't be so reprovingly con-&#xD;
tented. You wouldn't be, perhaps, if you had seen as much of the world as I&#xD;
have, and knew by experience how much livelier places there are in it than&#xD;
Sea Lodge. What I am crazy for is Newport."&#xD;
"What is Newport?" inquired Nestoria.&#xD;
What is Newport? " repeated Alice. "Oh, of course you don't know.&#xD;
Well, Newport is the pri ncipal seaport of-of Mount Pisgah."&#xD;
Nestoria perceived that Aliee was laughing at le:, and a blush of dismay&#xD;
and distress danced into her cheeks, so sensitive can a young p rson be who&#xD;
grows up'in Nestorian hamlets, surrounded by grave, considerate, kindly peo.&#xD;
ple.&#xD;
"Really, you ought to be shown Newport," continued Alice. "If uncle&#xD;
wasn't shamefully mcan  "&#xD;
"Don't!" pleaded Nestoria, forgetting her sense of humiliation in her de-&#xD;
sire to defend the excellent Judge.&#xD;
"I mean if he wasn't dreadfully good and conscientious, and so forth, he&#xD;
would take us there. We should see some living life, and we should pick up&#xD;
beaux. They are a deal finer than cockle shells. They are the most interest-&#xD;
ing of objects by the seaside. And there is.one particular beau of mine whom&#xD;
i should dearly like to meet again for the ,fun of laughing at his oddities.&#xD;
Men are always more entertaining than women; they are so much more un-&#xD;
trammelled, and do so much queerer things, and have so much more charac-&#xD;
ter; but this special man is as diverting as a cage full of monkeys. He is a&#xD;
Pole, so he says, and a count also, so lie says, and I never heard anybody- say&#xD;
to the contrary, and it may 1)e so. But at 'any rate he is a gentleman, and&#xD;
handsome, and pretends to be very learned, arid as polite as a pickpocket, as I&#xD;
hoard somebody put it; and oh, so devoted, such compliments, such nonsense&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         31&#xD;
I could listen to him forever, only it might kill me with laugmng. Count Po-&#xD;
loski. It's quite a distinguished name, isn't it? And he is a great favorite, I&#xD;
can tell you; and the attentions he paid me set more than one other girl on a&#xD;
pincushion; and of course that made the fun all the greater. Oh yes, what&#xD;
with the Count and lots more not so very much wiser, and a few who are re-&#xD;
ally fascinating and irresistible, Newport is a delightful sort of Vanity Fair,&#xD;
and well worth showing to you."&#xD;
Nestoria made. no response. Either Alice's description of the charms of&#xD;
Newport  did not present a temptation to her mind, or she thought it wrong to&#xD;
discourse of such temptations.&#xD;
'This evening we will get u our own Newport," continued Miss Dinnefoid.&#xD;
"We will walk alone and in sil nce on the beach, and view the moonlight."&#xD;
"I wish you would,"answered Nestoria, who honestly thought this simple&#xD;
treat delightful.&#xD;
" You don't mean it! " echoed the worldling of twenty, in mockery. '' Well,&#xD;
reckless as the dissipation may be, we will plunge into. it. But what would&#xD;
your father say?"S/&#xD;
" don't see why he should object,"t wondered the innocent from the dove-&#xD;
cote in Kurdistan.&#xD;
'Nor I either, on second thoughts," laughed Alice. "We may meet a&#xD;
few oysters, but they are deaf and dumb, you know; they won't even make&#xD;
signs to us. And even if they do, I hope we shall be above flirting with mol-&#xD;
lusks "&#xD;
Are they mollusks?" queried Nestoria. " Oh dear, how little I know&#xD;
about this wonderful world that I live in! I must recommence my studies."&#xD;
Let them go at mollusks," advised Alice. ."I am sure I don't know&#xD;
whether they are or not, and don't care. I am sorry I used the horrid word,&#xD;
since it has waked up your worrisome conscience. What do you have such a&#xD;
conscience for? It must be very inconvenient."&#xD;
"Alice, I should be afraid of you if I thought you meant half you say,"&#xD;
gravely observed Nestoria.&#xD;
"Oh, I don't; I don't mean a quarter of it," affirmed Alice. "I mainly&#xD;
mean to talk. When I can't find any human being to listen to me, I talk to&#xD;
the cat; and didn't I get a lecture on the subject one day from Uncle Wetherel!&#xD;
Alice,' said he, ' conversation addressed to a dumb beast must be considered&#xD;
as idle conversation, and as such we shall be called to account for it.' Now&#xD;
ho you believe that the recording angel takes down what I say to a pussy cat?-&#xD;
If so, he must take down what Uncle Wetherel says to Old Sorrel. But I&#xD;
don't believe it. - I don't believe that angels attend to any such small busi-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"Alice, I wish you wouldn't speak of such subjects so-gayly," murmured&#xD;
Nestoria. "You fill ie with astonishment and perplexity."&#xD;
"Poor little. dove!" said Alice. "how could they send you out of the&#xD;
ark? '"&#xD;
As the girls prepared to take their walk 'in the evening Mrs. Dinneford&#xD;
asked where they were going.&#xD;
" Nantucket, Cape Cod, and all along shore," answered her daughter.- " If&#xD;
we don't come hack, inquire at Marblehead."&#xD;
"Don't expose'yourselves too long to the night air." counselled the elder&#xD;
woman, o, lihtsmano eder women, was much given to medical precepts.&#xD;

32                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"The moonlight is healthful, begging your pardon, Mrs.:Dinneford," in-&#xD;
terposed the Judge. "The moonlight is but the reflection of the life-giving&#xD;
sunlight. It is the dampness of the night air which is not healthful."&#xD;
"I was always brought up to believe that it was the moonlight which did&#xD;
the harm," persisted good Mrs. Dinneford, a kind soul not without obstinacy.&#xD;
" When our bringing up is contrary to the truth, we must abjure it, as we&#xD;
would abjure and renounce our original sinfulness," lectured the old gentle-'&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"I have the greatest mind to walk out with you, children,"~said Mrs. Din-&#xD;
neford. 'If you'll wait just a minute till I find my hat and shawl-"&#xD;
"Oh, mamma, don't!" protested Alice. "You know you never will find&#xD;
your hat and shawl. And besides we want to take a romantic walk and fill&#xD;
our tranquil souls with meditation, and if you go with us you will spoil all&#xD;
that by talking-a steady stream and quoting Tupper."&#xD;
Well, go along," laughed the mother. "But do be careful, and if you&#xD;
meet any strangers turn back, for there are too many wild people about here&#xD;
of nights."                '&#xD;
" Without are dogs," quoted the Judge.&#xD;
Sothe two girls went unattended down to the beach and strolled along its&#xD;
enchanted meanderings. The ripples of a brimming tide joyously patted the&#xD;
sands at their feet, and a varying moonlight descended upon them through&#xD;
the shifting mountains of cloudland. The harbor, a sheet of sombre azure&#xD;
chased with sparkling silver, swept out into the broad expanse, here obscure&#xD;
and there effulgent, of the Sound. Miles away a light-house beamed luridly&#xD;
"like a star on eternity's ocean." A single sail, undoubtedly that of a pleasure&#xD;
boat, now gleaming like polished marble and now darkening into a misty&#xD;
ghost, was the only moving object in the exquisite picture. For nearly half&#xD;
an hour the pair wandered; the lively Alice chattering gayly, or throwing&#xD;
pebbles into the water, or whirling on her heel to make marks in the sand;&#xD;
while the quieter Nestoria listened, smiled, and loitered, half lost in waking&#xD;
dreams.&#xD;
"I would like to stay here till morning," murmured the waif from the&#xD;
arid Orient. "This world of waters is something so new to me, and so inex-&#xD;
haustibly wonderful, that it bewitches me."&#xD;
"So would I like to make a night of it, if there were only dancing," an-&#xD;
swered the representative of New York society. "Oh, don't I hate quiet, and&#xD;
don't I love company! I was made to buzz. and hum through life like a fly,&#xD;
always looking for a swarm of other flies. Uncle Wetherel compares me to a&#xD;
hornbug; you know what headlong, noisy things they are, and how they blun-&#xD;
der about; buzz, bang, and down they come on their backs and kick dread-&#xD;
fully; and then up again, to knock their heads against some other corner and&#xD;
get another great fall, like Humpty Dumpty. It's an odious comparison, and&#xD;
I don't assent to it altogether; and yet I must admit that there is something a&#xD;
little like, for I do have a great many adventures, and bounce out of them&#xD;
safely."&#xD;
" That sail boat is coming to land," observed Nestoria. " Ought we not to&#xD;
go back? "&#xD;
"Go back? No. There are sail boats spinning up and down the harbor&#xD;
every evening, just for the sake of spinning up and down and enjoying the&#xD;
mnot'on. You might as well be afraid of gulls. The one lauds as often as the&#xD;
other."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
But it is close under that rocky point' declared Nestoria. " They could&#xD;
disep1bark there without our seeing them."&#xD;
"Oh, boats frequently sail under the bluff and then sweep on into thecove&#xD;
thend Wound they come very near the shore, too; we 'might perhaps hail&#xD;
them. Would you mind hailing them and then running away? There is just&#xD;
a possible small chance that sonme of our New Haven friends mightee in the&#xD;
boat. You won't? Oh, Nestoria, you are a regular drag and drawback to&#xD;
fun, and more prudent and shysthan my mother. You stay here while I climb&#xD;
up the rocks and look over to see who they are. It is only a few rods. Will&#xD;
youp"&#xD;
"Yes,1 conceded Nestoria. "But don't be gone long, and do be prudent."&#xD;
"If they are strangers, I will come directly back," promised Alice. She&#xD;
hufrri aay bn heart  g ecnnoissance, and clambered the little rocky&#xD;
bluff with a beating heart but with, a soul prepared for audacious ventures&#xD;
Reaching the seaside brow of the knoll, she looked down upon the boatures-&#xD;
covered thatit had drawn close up to the shore as if -the men in it  boat&#xD;
land, and was about to slip backhand return to Nestoria, when shepro se&#xD;
self called by nam e.whnseeadder&#xD;
"Who is it?" she asked in a voice of gleeful excitement.&#xD;
"Edward Wetherel; and Count Poloski is withtme."&#xD;
"Oh, Cousin Edward." -erxclaimed Alice. She hesitated -an instant and&#xD;
d, ome up here, Edward. And the Count may come, too."&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
A WRONG-IIEADED HERO.&#xD;
divulge what Edward Wetherel lhad to say to his cousin and&#xD;
ErFOrIE we mulgo ba  a little in his history and see how he had brought&#xD;
about this interview, or rather how he had been led onto it.&#xD;
He had parted from Nestoria on the Elm City, as we remember. without&#xD;
bidding her good-by; and we will add that he had left her thus because when&#xD;
nt to say his last word he found her already in the arms of Alice Dinne-&#xD;
herd;and with the Dinnefords, his lucky rivals in the good-will of his uncle, it&#xD;
was not possible for him to be cordial on instant notice.   .      f&#xD;
Now Edward was a wilful, self-seeking, pleasure-loving youngster. He&#xD;
ow         wa   , and he was greedy after agreeable emotions, and he took&#xD;
disappointments very unkindly. It annoyed him to lose the farewell scene&#xD;
which he had meant to have With Nestoria; to be cheated out of a final pres-&#xD;
suie of her soft hand and an investigating gaze into her blue eyes; to be gagged,&#xD;
as it were, just as lie was aboutto utter some sweet word which should com--&#xD;
pai her not to forest hi. Moreover, the mere sight of Alice was dishearten-&#xD;
ing and vexatious, reminding him as it did of that inconvenient quarrel with&#xD;
the Judge, which had been so hard on his feelings, and which threatened to&#xD;
e ruinous to his nurse. In asbitter modd he took a hack with his friend Wol-&#xD;
erton and drove to the New Haven House, very sadly disposed to call for&#xD;
wine or other mightier drinks ard make what lie called a night of it. They&#xD;
obtained adjoining rooms, and Wetherel presently threw the connecting door&#xD;
open, being much in need of uplifting converse.&#xD;
" Awfully depressing, this living alone in the world and doing nothing," he&#xD;
observed as he "curled and combed his comely head."  "I wonder if every&#xD;
fellow finds it as heavy work as I dodok                        self&#xD;
" I have rounded that point," said Wolverton. "I have broken mthse&#xD;
fairly in to an idle, useless, unfruitful bachelor life. I am serious in these&#xD;
days, but never desperate."&#xD;
"You are confoundedly discouraging, Wolverton," sulked the younger&#xD;
pleasure-seeker. "Is that all a fellow gets by giving himself up to having a&#xD;
goad time?"               'Ic'rta          m"alre      n  edrma&#xD;
"If he gets any more, he is luckier than I am," affirmed treelder man.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIIE WETHIEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
composedlyy but with sincerity. "On the whole I made a mistake in not mar&amp;amp;&#xD;
ring and going to work. That is, so I think. My notion .is that a wife and&#xD;
children keep a man full of work and worry, and so cheer him up by relieving&#xD;
him of himself. It is like putting on a blister to mitigate the rheumatism.&#xD;
Both are bad enough, but the blister is the best."&#xD;
Wetherel, a hopeful young egotist, never quite content in his selfishness,&#xD;
but always looking forward to a day when joy should be unconfined, was dis--&#xD;
mlayed by this unlooked-for confession.&#xD;
I have a great mind to turn a corner, and settle down to business, and&#xD;
perhaps marry," lie said.&#xD;
"Why don't you?" answered Wolverton, who was a kindly-hearted crea-&#xD;
ture enough, never doing mischief except when it was agreeable, and apt to&#xD;
wish well to young men. "And let me advise you. to begin by making up&#xD;
that family quarrel. .Go down to your uncle's villa and fall on his venerable&#xD;
bosom and get hold of the fatted calf. You are just a little bit of an idiot,&#xD;
youngster. - A man who will quarrel with a million ought to have his organs&#xD;
examined. I have had softening of the brain myself occasionally; but I never&#xD;
yet was so far gone as to disagree with a million."&#xD;
"It isn't I who quarrel," asserted Edward; and he was quite blindly seri-&#xD;
ous in so declaring. "It is the old one. He wants to govern me; wants to&#xD;
governme physically, morally, and intellectually; wants to'say what I shall&#xD;
eat, drink, think;and believe;- wants to rule soul, body, inwards, and exti'emi.&#xD;
ties. He is down on everything that a young man naturally prefers. Opposed&#xD;
to lager, opposed to dancing and whist, opposed to reading novels, opposed&#xD;
to fashionable churches and episcopacy, opposed to everything but Plymouth&#xD;
flock puritanism. low can a fellow submit to such prejudices and irrationality&#xD;
and domineering?  Quarrel?   I live my natural life and say my-honest&#xD;
thought; and thereupon he exorcises me as if I were Apollyon. I only ask&#xD;
leave to be human, andl he insists upon my being a ghost. His very way of&#xD;
talking makes his ideas forbidding. One word marches solemnly and grimly&#xD;
after another, like bearers at , a funeral. At the end of every sentence you&#xD;
think he is dead and want to pnt up a gravestone. lIe makes religion disagree-&#xD;
able. I don't hate religion; I am capable of admiring it; in such a shape as&#xD;
Nestoria Bernard I can worship it."&#xD;
It is more or less instructive to hear both sides in a controversy. From&#xD;
Edward's philippic, immoral and unreasonable as it was in the main, we can&#xD;
gather the regrettable fact that the exterior of Judge Wetherel's noble probity&#xD;
and sincere piety had some severe features which repelled instead of enticing,&#xD;
and that, had lie been less exacting and inflexible in the minor matters of his&#xD;
moral law, he might more easily have led souls into his own circle of beliefs&#xD;
and sentiments. It is furthermore worth considering that this same Nestoria,&#xD;
whom the young man was so ready to accept as a model of attractive devout-&#xD;
ness, found no difficulty in appreciating, respecting, and loving the Plymouth&#xD;
Rock puritan. One is tempted to query doubtfully whether two youthful peo-&#xD;
ple, who could look at the same standard character from such diverse stand-&#xD;
points,lwould be likely to join heart with heart for a journey through life, and&#xD;
whether, if they should so join, the result would be happy.&#xD;
Even that unenlightened worldling, Wolverton, a man little given to deep&#xD;
moral philosophizings and spiritual insights, eduld see through his friend's sec-&#xD;
ond-hand respect for religion in the form of a handsome girl, and smile at itsa&#xD;
preposterous magnanimity.&#xD;

.36                 THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"Gracious youngster!" he grinned. "How much you c:an put up with&#xD;
if it's only pleasant enough and pretty enough! Perhaps you could fancy St;&#xD;
Cecilia, now, or the Sistine Madonna. However, I must put something to&#xD;
your credit; there are stupider sinners than you; there are men who wouldn't&#xD;
like the irl at all. Well, how much and how long are you going to woi-&#xD;
ship the Final Good in her shape? I am interested in the child, and should like&#xD;
to knov what is going to be done for her."&#xD;
Wetherel made no reply; his face was agreeably pensive and his eyes&#xD;
softer than usual; he was pondering whether it would be well to fall in love&#xD;
with Nestoria.&#xD;
11Would you want to marry a staid little puritan, with a conscience and all.&#xD;
that sort of thing?" asked Wolverton.&#xD;
"I don't object to piety in a wife," responded the young man, with a liber-&#xD;
ality for which the Christian world surely ought to he grateful. "Indeed, I&#xD;
would rather have it. Do you suppose that I want one of the wild girls that&#xD;
I flirt with and everybody flirts with, and that have got, all the down of inno-&#xD;
cent simplicity rubbed off them, and that know so much too much of pretty&#xD;
much everything?".&#xD;
Well, it isn't nice; but plenty of fellows do marry just that sort; and&#xD;
somehow or other they makeover as good as new. Our American girls are&#xD;
a queer lot; they seem to have an inexhaustible reserve of innocence laid up&#xD;
somewhere; when the first supply is out, they absorb more. However, I like&#xD;
this' little seraph better than the other sort. She is such a replica of the one I&#xD;
knew! Why not keep her in mind? Such a match might bring you around&#xD;
with the Judge. I hate to see you lose that fortune."&#xD;
"I don't know," muttered Wetherel, with the vagueness of a man who is&#xD;
lost in troublous meditation. " It is all a muddle. Life is a confounded mud-&#xD;
tile."1&#xD;
The wilful and impulsive youngster, who had taken his own way so stub-&#xD;
bornly and got himself into difficulties thereby, was not quite certain that he had&#xD;
better do just what he wanted to do in the immediate future. He liked Nes-&#xD;
toria much, and believed that e should easily learn to love her, and found it&#xD;
veriy pleasant to think of marrying her. But there was a great risk in the&#xD;
roseate adventure; there was a chance of dropping from the horns of the&#xD;
matrimonial altarintothe trials of poverty; somewhat as the sacrificial in-&#xD;
fants of the Sidonians rolled out of the arms of. the god into the blazing fur-&#xD;
niace beneath.                                        dh    a   ut&#xD;
Lce feared lest the Judge had already disinherited him; and he was quite&#xD;
sure that le had spent the last penny of his paternal fortune. Indeed, he was&#xD;
in debt; creditors had drivenhim from New York and other creditors from&#xD;
Saratoga; at this very moment he was subsisting on money borrowed from&#xD;
Wolverton. Fifty thousand dollars had danced through the gateways of&#xD;
leasure, and only left him a craving for delights which he could no longer&#xD;
purchase. He had been- one of those thoroughly headstrong and reckless&#xD;
youths who are so common in Europe and so rare in America. Strong emo-&#xD;
tions, thoughtless generosity, and an 'ostentatious love of expense had bank-&#xD;
i'u pted him, In the last four years their malign magic had degraded him from&#xD;
the position of a youth of fair fortune, and made of him that wretched and&#xD;
ridiculous personmage whom slang has christened a " dead beat."&#xD;
luarry? Marry without a profession, without habits of labor, without a&#xD;
dollar to fee the parson ? And suppose his uncle should 'be unrelenting, and&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR37&#xD;
give him nothing, and even decline to recommend him for a position in the.&#xD;
custom-house? He-knew that, froni the staid and severe old man's point of&#xD;
view, he was untrustworthy and unendorsable and little less than abominable.&#xD;
He had disputed rules of conduct and articles of belief which the Judge held&#xD;
to be inexorably binding and -tremendously important. There had been wild&#xD;
orgies in his life in Paris and painful scandals in his life in New York; and a&#xD;
sufficiently accurate report of these excesses had reached the horrified ears of&#xD;
his relative. Finally (and here was another terrible charge against him in the&#xD;
eyes ofa prudent business man), he had beei not only unwise in regard to the&#xD;
concerns of the other world, but reckless in the affairs of this, investing reck-&#xD;
lessly and utterly wasting his substance.&#xD;
For these things he had been sternly reproved, and warned that severe&#xD;
punishinent would follow on continuance in evil, and all to no purpose. lIe&#xD;
had argued with lofty flippancy in defence of his ways, and had irritated his&#xD;
grave and conscientious adviser to the utmost. There had been a quarrel;&#xD;
the uncle had ceased to invite the nephew to his house; then he had sent for&#xD;
his more distant relatives, the Dinnefords; finally it was supposed that he had&#xD;
altered his will. - This last story Edward did not credit, until, having spent or&#xD;
lost his ultimate dollar, he fell into that depression of spirit which poverty&#xD;
brings to those whom it visits for the first time.&#xD;
1ow. lining on borrowed money, he did fear seriously that he had sold his&#xD;
birthright for departed messes of pottage. As he mechanically continued his&#xD;
light labor of personal adornment he meditated on the pit into which he had&#xD;
st'unibled, and on the chances of getting out of it. If he should reform, or&#xD;
pretend reformation; if he should humble himself before the Judge and lead a&#xD;
quiet life; if he should marry this daughter of a missionary, no doubt a pet&#xD;
with the devout master of Sea Lodge, would the riches which had taken wings&#xD;
fly back to him? The "dead beat " was far from certain of it, and no wonder&#xD;
that his fine eyes were gloomy.&#xD;
"'Well, Wolverton, we will see," lie said at last, trying to puff away his&#xD;
sorrows with a sigh. " I have a great mind to turn a corner, I don't like it.&#xD;
Be good, and you will be happy, but you won't have a good time. Now I&#xD;
want a good time. Still, it seems to be advisable to turn a corner ajid try the&#xD;
next street. Only we won't do it this evening. Let's get up some fellows and&#xD;
be jolly."&#xD;
There are no fellows here, I suppose," replied Wolverton. "None of&#xD;
our fellows."&#xD;
I saw the Count in the reading-room as we came tgp stairs."&#xD;
What Count?   here are so many counts! "&#xD;
Poloski, as he calls himself," said Edward, ringing the bell. " I'll have&#xD;
him up."&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
A GENTLEMAN AND SCHOLAR.&#xD;
" POLOSKI!" grumbled Wolverton. "What the deuce is.he here for? Run&#xD;
aground on the bottom of his purse and waiting for.a chance to gamble, I sup-&#xD;
pose. What (10 you want him up for.? I don't believe in him."&#xD;
"There is something in blood," said Edward, remembering, with more than&#xD;
the pride of his uncle, that he was descended from many recorded Wetherels.&#xD;

"I suppose a count must be a gentleman in some one point of his character, if&#xD;
you can only discover what that point is."&#xD;
"I never knew one in this country who could be trusted," asserted Wolver-&#xD;
ton. " They are all dead-beats, looking out for a rich marriage or some other&#xD;
chance to swindle somebody. And to the best of my travelling observation and&#xD;
study, four-fifths of those in Europe are no better. Poloski at any rate is a&#xD;
sucker. He is a sponge incarnate."&#xD;
"You needn't lend him anything. Tell him you have passed over all your&#xD;
flush to me., Come. let's have him in. He is such a confounded blowhard and,&#xD;
monkey that he is amusing."&#xD;
"Send for- him," returned Wolverton, a lazily obliging man, as many idle&#xD;
people are.&#xD;
On the arrival of a waiter to answer the bell, Edward despatched him in&#xD;
search of the distinguished foreigner.&#xD;
" Tall, light-complexioned fellow," he. explained. "Looks a little like me;&#xD;
perhaps a good deal."    .&#xD;
"I wouldn't say that," put in Wolverton when the servant had departed.&#xD;
"It's a resemblance that isn't recommendatory."&#xD;
"I don't brag of it," laughed the young man. "But I have been taken for&#xD;
him, and I know he can wear my clothes. Borrowed a tiptop suit once and&#xD;
never returned it. Fitted him like a glove. Whenever I met himin it, bow-&#xD;
ing and grimacing in his ridiculous style, I felt like saying, 'How are you, you&#xD;
jackanapes of a Wetherel, and what are you cutting up those monkey-shines&#xD;
for?'"&#xD;
Presently the noble guest of America entered the room. He was certainly&#xD;
very like Wetherel; he had the same fair skin and hair, the same resolute blue&#xD;
eyes and prominent chin, the same height and slenderness; furthermore, he&#xD;
appeared to be of about the same age, although he was in reality several years&#xD;
older. The resemblance between the two men did not, however, extend tO&#xD;
expression and mann er. Poloski's expression was against him; it had un-&#xD;
pleasant gleams of furtiveness and dexterity; it suggested a man who lives by&#xD;
his wits; In gesture and style of speaking he was more graceful and animated&#xD;
than the young American, or than Americans- in general. Nor. was it quite&#xD;
just to accuse him of " monkey-shines "; his address, though lively, was hu-&#xD;
man enough, and fairly agreeable. His accent in English was.nearly perfect,&#xD;
which, I believe, is not a wonderful thing in a Pole.&#xD;
"How do, Wolverton? How do, Wetherel?" he said in rapid, cheerful,&#xD;
pleasant tone, at the same time showing his teeth cordially. "So glad to find&#xD;
you here! What a dull place this is, to be sure! 'But I am in luck. I was&#xD;
just thinking how I could pass the evening, and here you are;. the riddle is&#xD;
solved.. Thank you, Wolverton; I never refuse a cigar ;. at least, never yours.&#xD;
Have you taken tea? So have I. We.bnve the evening before us, and it's all&#xD;
serene and the goose hangs high; as you Americans say. I like your slang, so&#xD;
fresh and picturesque, so full of metaphor. All slang is worthy of study; it is&#xD;
the source and life of language; speech would become dead without it. I read&#xD;
an essay. on the slang of the Teutonic tongues before the Royal Society of Ber-&#xD;
lin.. I will show it to you some day."&#xD;
Wetherel gave Wolverton a glance which was as much as to say, "There&#xD;
.he goes again!" To boast of literary and scholarly attainments was one of the&#xD;
habits of the Count. He was continually telling you that he had written this&#xD;
or that elegant or recondite work, and promising to let you see it, only he never&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETEEREI AFFAIR.                   . g&#xD;
brought it. If he borrowed a book or bought one (which he frequently did on&#xD;
trust), he would usually remark, "I take this for the pleasure of studying the&#xD;
nian's style; the subject is familiar to me."              t&#xD;
"What brings you tothe Athens of Connecticut, Count?" asked Wolvertnn,&#xD;
easily repressing what desire he had to examine the essay on the "Slang of&#xD;
the Teutonic Tongues."&#xD;
" A young lady," replied the noble stranger, showing his teeth with a glee&#xD;
which was close upon triumph. " What else could bring me anywhere? '&#xD;
lovely and dashing Miss Alice."&#xD;
"Family name? " inquired Wetherel.&#xD;
"I'beg your pardon," smiled the Count, leaning forward apologetically.&#xD;
"What is her family name?" repeated Wetherel.&#xD;
"IAh, yes; Dinneford."&#xD;
The two Americans exchanged glances, and Alice's second cousin looked&#xD;
slightly indignant.&#xD;
"I hoped for her at Newport, but she did not come," continued Poloski.&#xD;
"So I learned of her whereabouts and followed her to her retreat. Besides, I&#xD;
wanted a quiet seashore place. I propose to sail, fish, and pay court to Miss&#xD;
1)inneford."&#xD;
"Nice plan," observed Wetherel, who had recovered his good humor, see-&#xD;
ing perhaps a chance to make sport of his patrician. "I shouldn't wonde4if&#xD;
you succeeded. You are a Pole, you know, and a long one, and they say the&#xD;
longest poles knock the persimmons."&#xD;
"Is that a slang?" asked Poloski, with the joy of a discoverer. "But I do&#xD;
not perceive the application. What is a persimmon, and what has a Pole to&#xD;
do with it?"&#xD;
" A persimmon is a fruit and a pole is a stick," explained the young Amer-&#xD;
ican, with an indifference which apologized for his poor joke.&#xD;
But the student of slang was delighted. "Oh! I understand," he ex-&#xD;
claimed. "A Pole, yes! The longest poles knock the persimmons. Very&#xD;
good. I shall remember that."&#xD;
" I know where your Dulcinea is staying," continued Wetherel. "If-you&#xD;
want,,I will take you to a quiet boarding-place hi plain sight .of the house&#xD;
where she is."&#xD;
" Will you? " said the gratified Count. " I invite you to lodge there with&#xD;
me. We will make a summer together; that is, we will make an August to-&#xD;
gether."&#xD;
"How are you off for stampsP" prudently inquired the American, not car-&#xD;
ing to furnish the funds for both.&#xD;
"The looker is full of shot," laughed Poloski, slapping a pocket.' "I was&#xD;
in luck at Newport. Poker is for me a propitious pastime, a game of good for-&#xD;
tunes. By the way, do you care to play to-night-just a little?"&#xD;
"No, no," said Wetherel, shaking his head with frank positiveness. "You&#xD;
are too many for nme."&#xD;
"Too many for me," repeated the Count. "Another of' your American&#xD;
slangs; and good-very expressive.;, Too many for me. Very good."&#xD;
"You had better go along with us, Wolverton," added Wetherel. "The&#xD;
place I. mean is on Lighthouse Point. We - can bathe and sail all we like, and&#xD;
there ;is fishing among the Thimble Islands. Come, old fellow ; say you wil.&#xD;
" Yes, say you will," echoed Poloski, catching at the phrase as a new one.&#xD;
" Where there's a will there's a way. Say you will, and then go It."&#xD;
&#xD;

40                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"While you're young," suggested Edward. " You are in the vein, Polos-&#xD;
ki. Tell him to go it while he's young."&#xD;
"Yes, go it while you're young," laughed the Count, enjoying this sort of&#xD;
talk amazingly; for was it not linguistic exercise and getting a mastery over&#xD;
slang?&#xD;
"That will do," said Wolverton. "I don't mind trying it for a few days.?'&#xD;
He did not care to leave his young friend with Poloski, lest there should be&#xD;
poker and the funds which he had loaned should evaporate. At the same time&#xD;
he approved of the selection of Lighthouse Point as a place of sojourn, for the&#xD;
reasons that it was within easy reach of Sea Lodge, and that it was quite nat-&#xD;
ural that Edward should want to be near Nestoria, and that good might come&#xD;
of his being near his uncle.&#xD;
On the following da~y, therefore, this trio drove in a hack to the Point and&#xD;
secured lodgings in the house of one of t ose seaside farmers who combine&#xD;
fishing with agriculture and "summer boars." Remembering that the Count&#xD;
came hither in order to be within flirting re ach of the '"lovely and dashing"&#xD;
Miss Alice, and appreciating with due sympathy his fond dreams of walking&#xD;
daily under her window and gesticulating at it with a sentimental handker-&#xD;
chief, we can imagine the surprise and discontent with which he learned that&#xD;
s   dwelt on the opposite side of the harbor, divided from his palpitations by&#xD;
ee miles of salt water.&#xD;
"I thought you told me it was close by," he remarked with a grin of an-&#xD;
noyance.&#xD;
"In plain sight, I said," returned Wetherel. "Don't you see it?"&#xD;
"Yes, I see it. But what is the use ? I cannot pay court through a tele-&#xD;
scope; and she will not even know that I am here. One might as well be the&#xD;
man in the moon. How am I ever to reach there?"&#xD;
" Leander swam the Hellespont, and I will swim this here," chanted Ed-&#xD;
ward.-&#xD;
" How shockingly you sing," sulked Poloski. "No Americans have ear or&#xD;
voice. And the air is utterly common."&#xD;
At the same time he resolved that if Wetherel ever should enter the lists of&#xD;
poker with him he would show him no mercy.&#xD;
If you don't like swimming, you can sail," continued the American.&#xD;
"Take a boat and go over there by moonlight. No young lady could resist it."&#xD;
" Delightful! " cried the Count, cheering up at once. " Exquisitely roman-&#xD;
tic! My dear Wetherel, you sing charmingly. . When will you go?"&#xD;
Edward reflected for a moment. Should he take this adventurer, this possi-&#xD;
bly vulgar impostor, into the neighborhood of his relatives? Well, yes; there&#xD;
was little likelihood of serious harm.resulting; his cousin was sufficiently ex-&#xD;
perienced in flirtations to be able to take care of herself. Furthermore, why&#xD;
should he be tender of Alice? The Dinnefords had been injurious to his pros-&#xD;
pects in life, as he supposed; and perhaps if they should commit a folly,-if&#xD;
Alice should accept the attentions of this absurd and dubious Count, it might&#xD;
diminish their noxious influence; the strict and practical old Judge might take&#xD;
a disgust to them and turn again to favor his nephew. In allowing these&#xD;
thoughts to rule him he did not see proof that he was a bad fellow; he merely&#xD;
understood in a careless way that he was justifiably vindictive and intelligently&#xD;
politic. How clement we are apt to be in the matter of ehrging meanness or&#xD;
guilt upon ourselves! There is surely some need of an ace sing angel.&#xD;
But in spite of his egoism anid his imperfect percepti n 1f the beautiful and&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                          41&#xD;
good in conduct, he did feel bound, if only out of respect to himself, to give the&#xD;
fount a warning that the proprieties. must be strictly observed, even in paying&#xD;
suit to a young lady who could be fairly described as " dashing."&#xD;
"You must understand, Poloski," he said, " that this Miss Alice is my sec-&#xD;
ond cousin."&#xD;
"You astonish me," bowed the Count. "I incline to your authority.''&#xD;
"1I don't boast any," continued Edward. " Her mother and her uncle claim&#xD;
all there is, I suppose. And besides, I believe that the girl is more than your&#xD;
match, and that you can't fascinate her."&#xD;
" At least permit me to pay her my humble respects," begged Poloski.&#xD;
" We will sail over there," assented Edward. "I have my own reasons for&#xD;
going. And you may walk by the house once and wave your handkerchief."&#xD;
So, one moonlit evening, Wetherel took Poloski in a "sharpy " and pi-&#xD;
loted him to the other shore; and there, as we already know, they came upbn&#xD;
Alice Dinneford, lightheartedly watching for adventures.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
THE FLIRTATIONS OF A PHILOLOGIST.&#xD;
" COME up here," Alice Dinneford had called, when Edward announced him-&#xD;
self and his companion from the boat.&#xD;
Oh, Count Poloski! " she added, with a hearty laugh as the two men&#xD;
clambered the face of the little bluff and reached her side. " Who could have&#xD;
huagined meeting you here! Isn't this romantic! Isn't it bully! " she para-&#xD;
ph'rsed, remembering the, Count's appetite for slang. " Did you sail all the&#xD;
way from Newport? Where do you hail from and where are you bound?'.&#xD;
Like a youthfull veteran in flirtations, as she was, she was not a bit.embar-&#xD;
rassed, much less frightened.&#xD;
"I have hailed from clouds of despair and I am bound in chains of admi-&#xD;
ration," replied Poloski, somewhat elaborately polite and complimentary, as&#xD;
continental Europeans are apt to'be in our judgment.&#xD;
Alice laughed again very merrily, immensely amused with his turn of her&#xD;
inquiry, and amused too with the situation.&#xD;
"I know, I know,".she said. "You are always in chains for every lady&#xD;
you see. I thought you were at Newport, worshipping a hundred of them."&#xD;
"I was at Newport," admitted the Count, with a look which seemed to cast&#xD;
scorn upon the place. "But how could I stay at Newport when Miss Dinne-&#xD;
.ford was not there ? "&#xD;
"Oh, of course you couldn't,", declared Alice with renewed laughter.&#xD;
" Who could P Of course the men are leaving Newport by hundreds because&#xD;
I am not there. Oh, Count, how you gentlemen from Europe do flatter! You&#xD;
tell us simple American girls all the fine things that you used to tell the grand&#xD;
ladies of all the courts. And some of us believe every word you say."&#xD;
She laughed at his compliments, and yet she was gratified by them; she&#xD;
laughed at the man himself, and yet she liked to have him about her; was he&#xD;
not an admirer, and was he not a noble ? While Poloski was fishing in the&#xD;
-depths of his fancy for another scrap of adulation, she turned to her relative&#xD;
with a graver air than she had worn hitherto, and -asked, " Where are you&#xD;
staying, Cousin Edward? "&#xD;
" At Brown's, on the other side of the bay," he said. " The Count and Mr&#xD;

&#xD;
THE-WETIIEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Frank Wolverton are with me. We thought we could amuse ourselves there&#xD;
for a while. How is your mother?"&#xD;
"She is verywell, thank you," the girl replied mechanically. "Always&#xD;
well and in good spirits, you know."&#xD;
And my uncle?" lie added after a pause.&#xD;
"As usual," she said. It was not easy for hei to talk with Edward on that&#xD;
subject. In the first place, it suddenly occurred to her that if the strict and&#xD;
prudent old gentleman should hear of her being out alone with her present&#xD;
company, lie would not take the adventure in an approving spirit. Further-&#xD;
more, she knew of the family' quarrel; and she guessed that there might be a&#xD;
last will and testament of a retributive character; a will, possibly, that would&#xD;
lead Edward some day to denounce her and her mother as unprincipled and&#xD;
grasping intriguers.-&#xD;
"Are you coming to see him? " she faltered.&#xD;
Some day I may venture," lie replied moodily.&#xD;
" Will you!" she exclaimed cheerfully; for she was not selfish, knowing in-&#xD;
deed too little of the value of money to be greedy about it; and she would&#xD;
have been heartily glad o - reconciliation between the young man and the&#xD;
old one, even though it cost ier much filthy lucre. " I wish you would," she&#xD;
added. " Mamma and I w 11 do our best to make the visit pleasant to you."&#xD;
You are a good cou n," said Edward, tal ing her hand and pressing it.&#xD;
This unexpected prais , uttered in such a moving tone of honest thanks,&#xD;
brought a little flash  moisture into the girl's eyes. She was profoundly&#xD;
gratified that her  nerosity of feeling had been understood and appreciated.&#xD;
Light-headed   er as she was, there was a solid foundation of goodness and&#xD;
blindness in her, discoverable to serious souls by dint of happy accident or se-&#xD;
vere delving. Perhaps we may venture to aflirmn that every woman has as&#xD;
many characters as a cat has lives.&#xD;
Her utterance of friendship brought her a reward which she had not desired&#xD;
and for which she was not thankful. Wetherel had intended to give her a lit-&#xD;
tle season of lovely flirtation with Poloski; he had been mean enough and&#xD;
hard enough to decide that she might fall a victim, if she chose, to the fellow's&#xD;
fortune-hunting blandishments; but now his finer feelings and moralities re-&#xD;
covered their power, and he decided to watch over her. Seating himself on a&#xD;
bowlder, with his face toward the shining of the sea, he said, " Go on with your&#xD;
talk about Newport, you two, and don't mind a dull fellow who wants to&#xD;
mope.",&#xD;
"Miss Alice, when you speak of courts, you speak of your own proper&#xD;
sphere," put in the Count, who had at last discovered the compliment for&#xD;
which he had been searching. "I should be most glad to see you in regal cir-&#xD;
cles. I should take high pleasure in introducing you. It would give me the,&#xD;
greatest satisfaction to behold your triumphs over all those ladies that we have&#xD;
to pay our compliments to when we are at home." ,&#xD;
"Oh, don't!" said Alice, who was still thinking of the Wetherel imbroglio,&#xD;
and could not at once recover her frolicsomeness. " You are piling up the&#xD;
agony a little too high, 'as the comic men in the newspapers express it.",&#xD;
"Piling up the agony!" echoed the rejoiced Count., "That is another&#xD;
slang, isn't it? How expressive it is, and diverting! Yes, Miss Dinneford, I&#xD;
will pile up the agony ; I will pile it up as high as the clouds. My heart shall-&#xD;
be crushed under it."&#xD;
Alice could be grave no longer ; she shouted with laughter.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETEREL AFFAIR.                         4&#xD;
"You"mustn't do it," she said. " It would be too painful to contemplate.&#xD;
There wouldn't be a dry eye on earth."&#xD;
"But I must," persisted Poloski enthusiastically. "It is in my nature to&#xD;
do it. And it is in yours to-to  "&#xD;
"To grin and bear it," suggested Alice.&#xD;
"Another slang!" fairly yelled the delighted nobleman and linguist.&#xD;
What a language! It is so rich, so flashing, that it makes me wink.' This&#xD;
English tongue is one vast orientalism. It is one tangled forest of metaphor.&#xD;
I have written a work on the Migrations of Metaphor, which was published in&#xD;
German by order of the Imperial Society of Vienna. I will give you a beau-&#xD;
tiful copy of it, Miss Alice."&#xD;
Donit fail," urged Alice, who did not understand a word of German, and&#xD;
never read anything more solid than a book of travels.&#xD;
After a short silence Poloski added, with a mazed and helpless expression&#xD;
of countenance, " I have forgot what I was wanting to say."&#xD;
You were talking about you great work," suggested the young lady.&#xD;
No, no ; i~t was not that. Ah, I remember. . Your nature. You did not&#xD;
let me conclude. I was going to say it was in your, nature to make men pile&#xD;
up the agony. . And then comes the question, What shall they do? flow&#xD;
shall they be relieved? "&#xD;
" Why, let'them ,go up to the top of their respective agonies and jump off,"&#xD;
laughed the girlish trifier.&#xD;
Capital! ".roared the Count. "It is true; there is no other escape; and&#xD;
now, see me, I shall jump off," he concluded, swinging his arms as if lie were&#xD;
about to.leap into time harbor.&#xD;
"Oh, do stop him," laughed Alice, almost in convulsions., "I 'shall have&#xD;
hysterics in a minute. Count Poloski, you will certainly get a tumble if you&#xD;
are not more careful, and then all the fashionable watering-places will cry&#xD;
their eyes out."&#xD;
At this moment Ed ward asked, " Who is that up the beach, Alice? "&#xD;
Miss Dianeford uttered a little cry. " Dear me! And I have left her alone&#xD;
all this time. . The darling little dove will fly back to Mount Ararat."&#xD;
Is it Miss Bernard? " continued Wetherel, rising and facing toward the&#xD;
dinly seen figure. "I wondered you should- be out without her. But I sup-&#xD;
posed she was dutifully reading the ' Puritan Recorder' to the elder people.'"&#xD;
"And you didn't like to ask about her because you wanted so much to hear.&#xD;
I understand the timorous ways of young gentlemen. But how well you know&#xD;
'her! She does read the ' Puritan Recorder' to the elder people. Isn't she a&#xD;
good, dear little thing? I think her queer name just suits her. Nestoria-&#xD;
isn't it odd-and pretty? "&#xD;
" What is Nestoria?" put in the Count.&#xD;
" A visitor and friend of mine," explained Alice. ." And, oh, such a per-&#xD;
fect little angelic beauty!"&#xD;
"Is she rich?," eagerly queried the noble foreigner.&#xD;
" No," petulantly responded Miss Dinneford, turning cool at once. "What&#xD;
a question to ask about a good, lovely girl!"&#xD;
."It is a pity," persisted Poloski, firm in his own opinion, concerning the&#xD;
desirableness of lucre. "Every beauty deserves to be rich.: A philosopher&#xD;
desires to see completeness. It is a shame to fortune when 'a beauty cannot&#xD;
dress beautifully. What did you say is her queer nameP"&#xD;
"Nestoria."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6242-00000023"/>&#xD;
44.                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"There is a people called Nestorians," commented the omniscient Count.&#xD;
"I wrote an Inquiry into the Origin of the Nestorians. I will give it to you&#xD;
some day."&#xD;
"Where are you going?" called Alice to Wetherel, who was strolling&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"He is going to make an inquiry into the Nestorian future," simpered the&#xD;
gallant Poloski, even more ready than a woman to suspect a courtship.&#xD;
Edward could not resist the temptation of an interview with Nestoria. In-&#xD;
deed, he never even thought of trying to resist it; fighting temptation wa~s not&#xD;
his favorite spiritual warfare; if he could be said to fight at all it was. oh the&#xD;
side of desire. A creature of impulse, he rarely asked himself whether a thing&#xD;
were right or wrong, but simply whether it would be pleasant and easy to do;&#xD;
and if it so seemed, he did it. It was lucky for him that his impulses were in&#xD;
general not such as the world has agreed to consider inhuman, degraded, and&#xD;
dishonorable. ,It was not moral principle and not self-control, it was merely&#xD;
an innate kindliness and that species of moral culture which is called a sense&#xD;
of honor, that had saved him from being a violator of laws and a criminal.&#xD;
He had a sort of conscience, but its main strength lay in self-respect and in&#xD;
respect for the name of Wetherel, and its boundaries of action were neither&#xD;
large nor well defined. He had also profound possibilities of moral and sen-&#xD;
timental energy; but those abysses had never yet been stirred into action by&#xD;
either events or teachings.&#xD;
We see what he was now doing, and how impulsively he set about it.&#xD;
Neither his speaking to Nest ria nor his leaving Alice with the Count was&#xD;
likely to conduce to good, and either might bring about trouble and evil. But&#xD;
he did not reflect upon that; he simply followed his inclination.&#xD;
"I am going to talk to Miss Bernard," he said over his shoulder. "You&#xD;
two can come on at your leisure."&#xD;
The flighty Alice fluttered a moment, seemed to be upon the point of fol-&#xD;
lowing him, and at last, entangled by her love of flirtation and frolic, loitered.&#xD;
" Tell her I will be with her in a minute," she called, and then turned a&#xD;
coquettish smile upon the joyful face of the fortune-hunting Poloski.&#xD;
Thus it happened that Edward Wetherel, striding hastily through the deep,&#xD;
noiseless sand, came unseen and unheard upon Nestoria.&#xD;
CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
A DAUGIITEIt OF ZION AND A SON OF BELIAL.&#xD;
WHEN Edward reached Nestoria she was gazing upon the moonlit sea,&#xD;
lost in a dreamy admiration of its dimpling, sparkling glory, and scarcely con-&#xD;
scious of the protracted absence of her friend.&#xD;
Hearing footsteps close behind her, she took it for granted that Alice had&#xD;
returned, and said, without looking around, "Ah, there you are. Isn't it beau-&#xD;
tiful! "..&#xD;
Wetherel, halting close by her shoulder, gazed down with enthusiastic&#xD;
admiration upon her fair face and golden hair, to which the moonlight com-&#xD;
municated such an unearthly radiance that she seemed more seraphic than&#xD;
human, and responded, meaning her more than the landscape, " Yes, very&#xD;
beautiful!"&#xD;
" Oh!" was the very natural exclamation of the startled girl, a's she sprang&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         45&#xD;
to her feet. Then recognizing him, she added. "Is it you, Mr. Wetherel?&#xD;
You frightened me."&#xD;
"I am sorry," he said, and so he was in a cheerful sort of fashion, his slight&#xD;
regret being mingled with joy at seeing her and a tender yearning to put re-&#xD;
assuring arms about her. " It was excessively awkward in me," he went on,&#xD;
keenly enjoying his apology. "I was so anxious to reach you that I forgot&#xD;
that I might alarm you."&#xD;
Where is Alice?" she asked, doubting whether she ought'to be alone with&#xD;
him, but doubting it, let us observe, through a purely instinctive shyness, and&#xD;
not because she suspected him of being unfit company.&#xD;
"She is there, with a friend of mine. She will be here in a moment."&#xD;
le barely touched the girl's hand, and then dropped it, so fearful was he -of&#xD;
still further disquieting her. Strange what an influence she already had over&#xD;
him! she could transfigure him both in character and manner. In her pres&#xD;
ence he seemed a different young fellow from the one whom we have heard&#xD;
pouring out hisrecklessness and bitterness of spirit in the society of Wolver-&#xD;
ton; and, for the moment at least, he was a very much better fellow than he&#xD;
was capable of being amid unrestraining and evil surroundings. There was&#xD;
something good left in his nature; he could perceive the charm of innocence,&#xD;
if only it wore the guise of beauty; he could, for the sake of the beauty,&#xD;
adore the innocence. He was as gentle and reverent with Nestoria now as if&#xD;
he had never been ungentle and irreverent with other women. Not a senti-&#xD;
ment that was unworthy, and not even a reminiscence. Not a thought of&#xD;
other girls whom he had made weep bitter tears; who had wept at parting&#xD;
with him when they ought to have wept only that they had ever met him;&#xD;
who had wasted on his hitherto ungrateful spirit both affection and pardon. He&#xD;
forgot all the evil of his life, and seemed to himself not merely to be good now,&#xD;
but to have been good always. The prime cause of this transformation, it&#xD;
will be easily guessed, was that he was somewhat in love.&#xD;
" Did you come in that boat? " asked Nestoria. "It seems as if you must&#xD;
have sailed out of the moon. Where did you come from? "&#xD;
"I have been living opposite you for the last two days. Only two miles  4"-&#xD;
from you, and in plain sight. Didn't you guess it?"&#xD;
"How could I?" returned the girl, and the answer really pained him.&#xD;
"Don't you find it very dull hereP" he continued, driven to make conver-&#xD;
sation.&#xD;
"Not a bit, I am happy and amused every moment.' I find your rela-&#xD;
tives delightful-Mrs. Dinneford and Alice and the Judge-I like them all."&#xD;
While he stumbled through some reply she fell into a meditation, not even&#xD;
hearing what he said, her mind.was so occupied. The question which en-&#xD;
gaged her spirit was, Should she allude to the family quarrel and try to end&#xD;
it? It grieved her beyond expression that two such men as Edward Wetherel&#xD;
and his uncle, two men who, in her eyes, were altogether noble and charming,&#xD;
should disagree. She liked them both very much, and she wanted them to&#xD;
like each other, not merely because their reconciliation would enable her to&#xD;
see them both, but also, because it would increase their happiness. Besides,&#xD;
they were relatives, and for relatives to live in enmity, how unnatural and&#xD;
dreadful!&#xD;
If any one has inferred from Nestoria's simple ways and innocent air that&#xD;
she was deficient in moral courage and energy, he has done her injustice.&#xD;
Duty was a mighty force in hersoul, and at its call she could face much. Was&#xD;

46'                 THE WETHEREL AFFAIR&#xD;
it her duty to examine this agreeable young gentleman auocut his misunder-&#xD;
standing with his, good uncle and to urge him to bring it to a-close? That&#xD;
was the whole question, she said to herself; and her liking for him helped her&#xD;
to decide it in the affirmative.&#xD;
"Why haven't you been to visit Judge Wetherel?" she asked with a firm-&#xD;
ness of voice and manner which surprised him.&#xD;
"Don't you remember?" he replied, almost submissively. "We are not on&#xD;
terms."&#xD;
"But why are you not on terms?" she continued, still resolute, though&#xD;
with a propitiatory, pleading smile. "Is it your fault-or his? "&#xD;
"It is not my fault," he burst out. "Look here, Miss Bernard; I will talk&#xD;
with you frankly about this matter. But first, has. lie told you anything against:&#xD;
me? "&#xD;
"No," said Nestoria. "Nor any one."&#xD;
" Then I mustn't talk harshly," he went on more tranquilly. "But still I&#xD;
will be as frank as I must. I want you to think charitably of me. The whole&#xD;
thing, then, is this: Am I to be governed? I don't quarrel with him, but he&#xD;
with me. Why? He wants to rule me, and I don't want to be ruled. He&#xD;
wants to humiliate me, and I won't -be humiliated. We both have our ideas.&#xD;
I leave him to enjoy his; why can't he leave me ii peace with mine? But lie&#xD;
can't. I must do and think and talk precisely as lie learned to do and think&#xD;
and talk three-quarters of a century ago. The older a man is, the more unfit&#xD;
he is to hold absolute rule over the young, because his notions are necessarily&#xD;
different from theirs, while not necessarily better. Suppose Adam were alive&#xD;
now and wanted all his progeny to obey him. Can't you see that his ideas&#xD;
might be unsuitable for the men of our day? What a time we should probably&#xD;
have with the old gentleman, to be sure, and how grimly lie would glare at us&#xD;
through his spectacles, and how he would wave us off his premises! Well, my&#xD;
uncle is not so very unlike what Adam might be. He has fearfully old-fash-&#xD;
ioned whims, and he is tremendously stiff in them. I have been driven, out of&#xD;
mere honesty and self-respect, to rebel. I am carrying on my war of independ-&#xD;
ence. You have heard of our revolutionary sires, and how they fought seven&#xD;
years for an abstraction, as the great Daniel phrased it. I don't mean the&#xD;
prophet, but the expounder.",&#xD;
So he went on for some minutes. He had thought so much of this quarrel .&#xD;
and argued its merits over to himself so often that his mind was brimming full&#xD;
of it. ie could talk about it as abundantly as an enthusiast -can declaim about&#xD;
his pet whimwham: a woman's -rights champion, for instance, about female&#xD;
suffrage, or a communist about a new division of property. He was in earnest,&#xD;
and indeed lie .was at heart very bitter, notwithstanding his jocosities about&#xD;
Adam and our revolutionary fathers.. This tone of jesting was assumed partly&#xD;
to keep down his painful irritability, and partly to hide it from Nestoria. He&#xD;
wanted to convince the girl, not only that he was right in the quarrel, but also&#xD;
that he was a good-tempered, pleasant fellow. Being very much taken with&#xD;
her, and for the moment at least not a little in love with her (she looked so&#xD;
unusually beautiful just then in the moonlight), he could not bear to have her&#xD;
think ill of him in any fashion whatever.&#xD;
Of course his defence of himself was mainly special pleading, and quite an&#xD;
unfair representation of his uncle's case against him. Did he-know it?. 'We&#xD;
must be so honestly severe with him,, we must so far expose the intellectual&#xD;
weakness which had grown out of his moral one-sidedness, as 'to declare that&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         47&#xD;
he was by no means fully aware of it. His dissipation did not seem to him&#xD;
wickedness; it was merely, as he tenderly put it to himself, "sowing' his wild&#xD;
oats "; it Was what one ought to expect of a young man, and rather admire in&#xD;
him than otherwise. Even the exalting and purifying presence of Nestoria's&#xD;
innocence could not so far lift him above his usual level as to enable him to&#xD;
see that his life had been notably blameworthy. In short, very unluckily for,&#xD;
his soul and 'his fortunes, he could neither condemn himself harshly, nor for-&#xD;
give the Judge for condemning him.&#xD;
Nestoria was much perplexed and a little troubled. She did not feel pleased&#xD;
with some remarks that this admirable young man had dropped. Wihn the&#xD;
reverent sensitiveness of a youthful soul which has received a purely religious&#xD;
education, she did not like to hear even the great Daniel Webster linked&#xD;
jocosely ,with that sacred Daniel who would not worship the gods of Babylon,&#xD;
while the story of Adam seemed to her the story of a great moral tragedy, al-&#xD;
together 'too solemn to be alluded to lighitl'. Furthermore, how could her&#xD;
judicious and vencrable and pious friend, the Judge, be- altogether wrong in&#xD;
this mrafter? It was extremely painful to her that Edward should speak of&#xD;
that good man as he had, charging him with holding ideas that were current&#xD;
before the flood, and hinting at his glaring at unconvinced people through his&#xD;
spectacles, and waving them irrationally off his premises. What if beliefs were&#xD;
antediluvian, so long as they were-sensible and holy and fruitful of good works?&#xD;
Enoch no doubt held antiiluvian notions, and yet he was judged worthy of&#xD;
translation.&#xD;
hIowever, Nestoria did not feel able to, take up an argument with this won-&#xD;
derful Edward Wetherel, as indeed it was not in her habits or disposition to&#xD;
argue, not even with herself. Her usual mental process in matters open to&#xD;
discussion *as to choose the right' with the lucid instinct of a pure, conscien-&#xD;
tious- nature, and to simply say with the utmost gentleness, Why not do it?&#xD;
It is a wonderfully effective mode of discussion, when one is gifted for it, and&#xD;
frequently dulls the edge of the keenest hair-splitting.&#xD;
i" He is much older than you," she sighed, after remaining some time in&#xD;
thought. " Couldn't you put up with something on that account? "&#xD;
"Perhaps so," mumbled Edward, feeling that his allocution had all been&#xD;
for naught. Then, his eyes still settled with steadfast admiration on her beam-&#xD;
ing face, he added, "I would much rather put up with something on your ac-&#xD;
count."&#xD;
"Will you come to the house soon and try to'see him?" she pleaded, so&#xD;
eager in her work of reconciliation that she did not notice his flattery.&#xD;
" Yes," he assented. "Yes, I will. Only, if you discover me coming, you&#xD;
must ask him to see me."&#xD;
"I will be on the lookout for you," she promised. " Oh, I am not a bit.&#xD;
afraid to ask him. He is so good, and it will be such a right thing to do! Be&#xD;
sureyou come."&#xD;
"Yes, yes," he repeated eagerly. more delighted with the interest that-she&#xD;
took in his affairs than with the prospect of reconciliation with his uncle, and -&#xD;
so emboldened by that interest'that he seized her hand and tried to kiss it,&#xD;
But the kiss went wild, for Nestoria snatched her fingers away, saying, " You&#xD;
mustn't."&#xD;
It was enough ; that gentle "mustn't " quelled him; it was mightier than a&#xD;
box on the ear from some girls.&#xD;
"It is an Oriental custom," she added, fearful that she had seemed un-&#xD;
&#xD;

friendly. " But I don't like it. It is the salute of an inferior to a superior, and&#xD;
it seems to me degrading to humanity."&#xD;
He would have liked a kiss of a more equal and exalted order, but he knew&#xD;
the girl too well and respected her too tenderly to ask it.&#xD;
At this moment Alice reached them on a little rustling run, calling breath-&#xD;
lessly, "Come, Nettie, we must go.  We shall miss prayers. Good-night,&#xD;
Cousin Edward. Come again."&#xD;
"Good-night, Mr. Wetherel," added Nestoria, and the two girls hurried&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"I will try it," muttered Edward to himself. "I'll see if the old gentleman&#xD;
has a soft spot in him, confound him!"&#xD;
It is sadly wonderful to observe how heartily relatives can dislike each  .&#xD;
.other, if their characters and tastes are in distinct opposition, and especially if&#xD;
they are a drag on each other's pleasures.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
WARNINGS WASTED.&#xD;
IT OW do you like Edward? " asked Alice.Dinneford on the mon&#xD;
after the adventure by moonlight&#xD;
I like him very much," replied Nestoria, with her characteristic frank&#xD;
nd simplicity, a childlike smile of pleasure r   to her lips at the. so&#xD;
of the name, and her eyes lighting up with eagerness to heir more of&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
Alice looked at her friend in amazement; such straightforwardness&#xD;
rt     young lady on such a topic surprised and puzzled'her; she could not ju&#xD;
;   from it whether Nestoria liked Edward a great deal or only a little.&#xD;
"What is the matter?" asked the missionary's daughter, whileablusl&#xD;
gathering embarrassment mounted into her cheeks and burned away there&#xD;
a conflagration, until her very ears tingled. "Have I said anything very&#xD;
gular?"&#xD;
I never saw such another girl," said Alice. "Do you really mean&#xD;
you think very highly of Edward?"&#xD;
Ile has been so kind and polite to- me!" apologized Nestoria, the hi&#xD;
meanwhile blazing in a manner to put one in mind of invaders ravaging (&#xD;
fair country with fire. "lHow can I help being grateful to him?"&#xD;
Miss Dinneford became uneasy; it occurred to her that she had done wr&#xD;
in leaving this artless child alone with her engaging but untoward relative&#xD;
was much as if she had abandoned Parley the Porter to the wiles of that c&#xD;
teous desperado, Mr. Flattery. In her own womanish, indirect way she&#xD;
about neutralizing whatever mischief might have resulted from Edward's&#xD;
cinations, by suggesting another admirer.&#xD;
This youngster is pleasant enough," she observed quietly. "But I h&#xD;
another cousin who would suit you a great deal better. It is Cousin Wal&#xD;
Ile isn't wonderfully handsome, perhaps, but he is wonderfully good."&#xD;
"And isn't Mr. Wetherel goodP" asked Nestoria, startled by such a cr&#xD;
suspicion that she could not conceal her concern, nor even think of conc&#xD;
ing it.&#xD;
" Oh, Edward is well enough," hastily answered Alice, who had a natu&#xD;
and generous repugnance to speaking ill of her relative, and in fact did&#xD;

50                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
think at all harshly of him because of his wild ways. " He is as good, I dare&#xD;
say, as young men average. What I mean is that he isn't of your sort."&#xD;
" Alice, tell me the truth!" exclaimed Nestoria, losing her self-possession&#xD;
in her anxiety. "Is Mr. Wetherel a bad man?"&#xD;
"I didn't say so," cried Alice, thoroughly discomposed. "Why,(wvhat non-&#xD;
sense! Didn't I tell you," she added, driven 'by erring good-nature into a fib,&#xD;
" didn't I just tell you that he is well enough? Only this other once is iso aw-&#xD;
fully good," she hurried on, seeking to slip away from the subject of the t some-&#xD;
what dubious Edward. "lie, I mean Cousin Walter, is fit to be a mis iona-y.&#xD;
I never hear him talk without thinking of St. Paul, or some such good little&#xD;
man. We expect him here very soon, and you will be delighted with hin, or&#xD;
I don't know your tastes. Another relative, a Cousin John, is coming with&#xD;
him; and that is all the cousins there are of us; big box, little box, band-box,&#xD;
and bundle; just-four cousins. Cousin John is the big box, for he is large and&#xD;
lumbering and noisy. Walter is the little box; oh, he is too little for any-&#xD;
thing; he is about your size. Edward is the band-box; and I must pass for&#xD;
the bundle. All women are bundles, just good to be handed about and to be&#xD;
in the way. And don't we make a fuss over each other when we get together !&#xD;
You would suppose there were no other people in the world than Dinnefords&#xD;
and Wetherels and their relatives. It is just like Noah's family coming out of&#xD;
the ark, with everybody else drowned and got rid of and out of mind. I hope&#xD;
you will put up with us. You must like Walter in spite of his littleness, and&#xD;
John Bowlder, too, in spite of his bigness."&#xD;
Alice could prattle like a running brook, and she did her talkative best on&#xD;
this occasion, struggling to get away from that ugly topic of Edward's charac-&#xD;
ter, and struggling with success.&#xD;
The bell rang for prayers; they rustled down stairs in obedience to it; then&#xD;
followed the quiet routine of a Sea Lodge day; the customary talk with the&#xD;
Judge about Nestorian missions, and other such godly matters; the (rives after&#xD;
old Sorrel, the readings and the walkings. Meantime Nestoria had Edward's&#xD;
promise -constantly in mind, and kept an anxious lookout for his expected call.&#xD;
Not, '1ivever, until the afternoon of the next day, as she wasreading the&#xD;
"Puritan Recorder" or some similar edifying publication to the Judge in his&#xD;
study, did she behold the young man entering the front gate of the grounds, a&#xD;
desired and yet alarming visitant. Her heart gave a great leap of unexpected&#xD;
terror; she looked at the Judge as a forlorn hope looks at the death-dealing&#xD;
rampart which it must storm; and then, repeating to herself her watchword&#xD;
of " duty," she set on gallantly. Laying down her journal she walked firmly&#xD;
up to the old man, met his inquiring gaze with a pleading smile, and said,&#xD;
"Your nephew is coming."&#xD;
"Edward!" murmured the Judge, getting on his feet in his slow way,&#xD;
much as a cautious man, fearful of falling, gets on a horse, and deliberately&#xD;
bringing his spectacles to bear upon the astonishing apparition.&#xD;
" Won't you see him?" begged Nestoria. "I think he wishes a reconcili-&#xD;
ation. I want you to see him."&#xD;
The Judge stared at her; then his glassy eyes settled on vacancy, as was&#xD;
his manner when in earnest thought;. at last he said solemnly, "We are&#xD;
taught out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. Yes, I will see him."&#xD;
Nestoria had one of those impulses which sometimes perform moral mira-&#xD;
cles. Putting "up her hands with spasmodic eagerness, she drew Mr. Wether-&#xD;
el's hoary head down to her and kissed his wrinkled cheek. The old gentle-.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.'.51&#xD;
man was helpless in her soft grasp; his caput was no more under his control&#xD;
than if it had been in a charger, borne before the daughter of Herodias; his&#xD;
venerable neck bent as easily as male necks generally do when lovely womar,&#xD;
pulls at them. Perhaps it was the first kiss that he had received in many&#xD;
years, for his austere deportment did not tempt to such familiarities, just as&#xD;
his serious spirit did not crave them. But he was evidently gratified by this&#xD;
touch of affectionate emotion; he looked very kindly after the girlas she hur-&#xD;
ried out of the study. It is pretty certain, too, that he did not compreheiid all&#xD;
the motives which had prompted the kiss; for after Nestoria had left him he&#xD;
murmured with grave simplicity, "The intercession of the righteous availeth&#xD;
much."&#xD;
With this promise of peace on his thin, and one might almost say trenchant&#xD;
lips, he hurried his heavy, squeaking boots to the front door of the house, and&#xD;
opened it to the prodigal nephew.&#xD;
"How do you do, uncle?" said the surprised young man; to which the&#xD;
Judge answered with solemn though courteous brevity, "Come in."&#xD;
When both were in the study, the senior closed the door, motioned his&#xD;
nephew to a cimir, seated himself with his 'usual rheumatic deliberation, and&#xD;
.observed, perhaps too much in the tone of a father confessor, or of a physician&#xD;
who is called. to prescribe in a difficult case, " You wished to converse with&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you for granting me an interview," bowed&#xD;
Edward. Then he paused, much perplexed and already a little indignant; for,&#xD;
in the first place, he did not know how gracefully to begin his act of submis-&#xD;
sion; in the second place, it seemed to him that his potent relative was cruelly&#xD;
formal.&#xD;
"If our meeting should bear any acceptable fruit," responded the Judge,&#xD;
"I will express myself as under obligations to you."&#xD;
It was not a cordial speech, and it was stifify uttered ; but the old man felt&#xD;
that he had before him a great criminal.&#xD;
" We parted on ill terms," said the youngster, making a violent effort to&#xD;
descend into the valley of humiliation. " I am sorry for it."&#xD;
"So am I," answered the Judge. "I am not willingly on ill terms with&#xD;
any human being, and much less with my own flesh and blood. You are the&#xD;
son of my dearest and brightest brother-the last brother that was spared to&#xD;
me    "&#xD;
He suddenly came to a pause. If the youngster could have believed his&#xD;
eyes, if lie could have had faith in the tenderness and affection of an old man,&#xD;
he might have been aware of a pathetic moisture behind those spectacles. The&#xD;
aged, especially such as have been left nearly alone in the world, are some-&#xD;
times piteously shaken by the remembrance of a bereavement.&#xD;
"You are Henry's son," continued the Judge, mastering his always tremu-&#xD;
lous voice. "I had accepted you in the place of all my own children whom&#xD;
God took to himself long ago. You are the last Wetherel of our stock. I&#xD;
do not think I am wrong in prizing the name of Wetherel. It represents to&#xD;
my mind so many pious men and women who have led worthy, devout lives&#xD;
on this favored New England soil, and have been translated from it to' Para-&#xD;
dise! I must and do venerate and love the name. I desire to see it continued&#xD;
in Prosperity if it can also be continued irn godliness.. And you are the last&#xD;
Wetherel! How can I willingly be on ill terms with you?"&#xD;
The young man bowed silently and with a seriousness which showed emo.-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6242-00000027"/>&#xD;
52                    THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
Lion. He too, we know, was proud of the name, and his uncle's feeling on the&#xD;
subject mcved him.&#xD;
"But I cannot love 'sin nor abet sinners," continued the old man. "If I&#xD;
am guided by any one motive in life, it is, I humbly trust, a sense. of duty.&#xD;
That motive I must obey, whatever my natural desires may be, whatever my&#xD;
earthly affections may urge. It will not let me hold fast to hands' which&#xD;
are full of wickedness, nor rejoice in feet which run in the ways of the&#xD;
scorner.'&#xD;
"You put it very strongly, sir." said the nephew, his Wetherel temnper and&#xD;
stubbornness rising. "I have lived the life of a young man. That is all."&#xD;
How can you abuse language thus? " demanded the Ju lge.  'Have you&#xD;
lived the life of that young man whom Jesus loved? Is the life of a young man&#xD;
necessarily a scandal to all pure men and pure women ? I must be plain with&#xD;
you, Edward, as I have always been. You have lived the life which leads to&#xD;
eternal death. You have banded yourself with the impure and with mnockers.&#xD;
Your chosen comrades have been the noisy sons of Belial. I will not speak,&#xD;
for very shame and pity, of your own deeds and words. You know well what&#xD;
they have been, and that they must fill me with horror."&#xD;
Edward was by this time angry and disgusted; he could not see that hehad&#xD;
neen such a wretch as his uncle painted him; and the portrait, as held up to&#xD;
his eyes, seemed the work of irrational prejudice and hostility. He was&#xD;
tempted to speak out in bitter wrath, and with difficulty controlled the unwise&#xD;
Impulse.&#xD;
"I came here to ask a reconciliation," he said. sullenly. "I see little pros-,&#xD;
pect of obtaining it."&#xD;
"You see it, then, in your own heart," declared the persuaded Judge, con-&#xD;
scious of rectitude. 'In mine, if you had that sight which looks into hearts,&#xD;
you would discover earnqt yearning for kindliness. I ask for bit one conces-&#xD;
sion-repentance of evil."&#xD;
"You want reformation, I suppose," muttered Edward,i&#xD;
"Yes, repentance and its fruits. I would not believe in the soundness and&#xD;
durability of reformation unless I could also see wise and devout sorrow for&#xD;
the past. Where there is no root there can be no worthy fruit."&#xD;
The young man hesitated, querying what he should say. le could not feel&#xD;
that he repented of his life of gayety, which had been to him while his money&#xD;
lasted a life of real pleasure, so strong were his physical powers of enjoyment&#xD;
and so keen his social instincts. But should he not, rather than lose all chance&#xD;
of succeeling to his uncle's estate, endeavor to counterfeit a penitential spirit?&#xD;
For a little time the two men remained silent, the younger fluctuating be-&#xD;
tween passion and the dictates of policy, and the elder praying in soul for that&#xD;
other soul.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
AN hIEIR-AT-LAW DISINHERITED.&#xD;
AFTER a minute' of meditation, which was as- terrible to bear as a night-&#xD;
mare, Edward rose,.witli a sense of great physical labor, to his feet, uplifting,&#xD;
indeed, a fearfully heavy load, the burden of his fate.          ~.&#xD;
Proud, frank, and in a certain sense noble-hearted, his inmost soul rejected&#xD;
the prostration of hypocrisy. Moreover, the hopefulness of youth, that joyous&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         53&#xD;
confidence of springtime blood which so incessantly prophesies smooth things.&#xD;
came like a proclamation of good auguries to his support, and heartened him&#xD;
to face his destiny. Finally, he was stubborn and pugnacious; like a true&#xD;
I etherel, he could not bear to be beaten.&#xD;
"I will not be a humbug," he declared, looking his uncle steadily in the&#xD;
face. "When I do repent of my life I will frankly tell you of it. But at&#xD;
present I do not see that it has been a disgraceful one.. I will merely'promise.&#xD;
this: I will take up a profession and study it hard; I will also reform my&#xD;
expenses.".&#xD;
The mere sound of his own voice was convincing to him, and by the time&#xD;
he had finished his speech he thought that he had made a great concession&#xD;
But the Judge could not thus look upon the matter ; he was aware of nothing&#xD;
but a burst of pride, perverseness, and wickedness.&#xD;
It is enough," lie answered, his voice even more tremulous with grief and&#xD;
indignation than with age. "It only remains for me to tell you what I must&#xD;
now do. I love my own name. I could wish to see the name of Wetherel&#xD;
written on the gates of prosperity. But when that name is blazoned in the&#xD;
haunts of sin Iwill not enrich it. The wealth of which God has made me&#xD;
steward shall not pave the broad way which leads to death. My estate will be&#xD;
parted among objects of benevolence and between my three worthy'relatives,&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford, Alice Dinneford, and Walter Lehming. You will owe me no&#xD;
thanks, and you need offer me no service."&#xD;
Brave as Edward was, and enduring as lie strove to be, he turned pale. He&#xD;
had partially expected this threat and had tried to brace himself against it;&#xD;
but no man can be fully prepared for the complete shock of ruin, and for ni&#xD;
instant this perverse youngster tottered. low could lie ever study his pro-&#xD;
posed profession without money? All at once, moreover, it struck him that&#xD;
he had lost Nestoria; that even if -he were able to meet with her again, he&#xD;
could not marry her. le looked at the old man with a feeble hope that he&#xD;
might not be fully in earnest; but one moment's study of that confirmed counte-&#xD;
nance and those settled eyes dispelled the misty doubt.&#xD;
"These hands," he declared, throwing them'out violently, '' shall support&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"It will be well for you," replied the Judge, learning for the first time, but&#xD;
without surprise, that the young man's property was gone. "In honest labor&#xD;
you may find renovation."&#xD;
Good morning, sir," added Edward, his voice almost choked with pas-&#xD;
sion. But as lie walked away he remembered Nestoria, and thought that lie&#xD;
might like to see her again, even under these wretched circumstances, and&#xD;
perhaps all the more because of them.&#xD;
"'Am I to understand that you turn me out of your house? " lie asked,&#xD;
pausing at the door.&#xD;
God forbid," replied the Judge. "' This house is open to every human&#xD;
creature. , I would not assume to bar entrance to it to any one, not even though&#xD;
no were my enemy. You are welcome at all times, for every decorous pur-&#xD;
pose."&#xD;
Edward already repented of his defiance, not because it had been wrong,&#xD;
but because it had brought calamity. For an instant he was half disposed to&#xD;
apologize for it and to try to bring about a .parting on kindlier terms. But hie&#xD;
-did not give way to this impulse for the reason that, as he believed, the attempt&#xD;
would degrade him, and would also be fruitless, li e cast an angry, sidelong&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
glance at his uncle, muttered to himself, "The stubborn, prejudiced old fool!"&#xD;
bowed in silence, and departed.&#xD;
At the gate he turned and looked the house all over in a state of mind tc&#xD;
lay his malediction upon it; but suddenly the whole building became illumi-&#xD;
nated with amiability to him;-he had caught a glimpse of Nestoria at her&#xD;
window.&#xD;
"The blessed damozel leaned out," he murmured. " )ear little golden-&#xD;
haired innocent! Was she watching me? Had she interceded for me? Do I&#xD;
owe her what little mercy was shown me by that old tyrant? I wish I could&#xD;
have seen her while I was talking-I should have been more prudent, wiser.&#xD;
Ah!" and he drew a deep sigh, "if religion were always like her! Ten thou-&#xD;
sand uncle Jabezes could not convert me. But she might-and may."&#xD;
Then he resolved anew that, as soon as the vacations ended, he would&#xD;
commence the study of medicine, and that he would study it furiously. For&#xD;
her sake, he declared in his exaltation, he would labor terribly ; he would en-&#xD;
dure, lie would vanquish, he would make for himself name and fortune; and&#xD;
then he would lay his heart and all that lie had at her feet. In his present&#xD;
condition of penury and friendlessness she seemed almost too high a match&#xD;
for him, and he began to long for her with fear, as men do for the difficult of&#xD;
attainment. Indeed, before he reached his own side of the bay, he had nearly&#xD;
.resolved to propose to her on the first opportunity,lest some other should step&#xD;
in and secure the precious prize. . That he might be unworthy of her accept-&#xD;
ance did not occur to him distinctly, if at all. He would make himselworthy;&#xD;
to please her lhe would do what he would 'not to please his uncle; lie Would&#xD;
rule his life for love as he would not rule it for fear.&#xD;
Meantime Nestoria was most anxious to know the result of the interview ;&#xD;
but although she got back to the Judge as soon as possible, she learned noth-&#xD;
ing. She longed to catechise lhim, but could not muster courage to do it.&#xD;
Duty had helped her to speak a word in favor of peace, but duty woull not&#xD;
hack her up in inquiring whether peace had been made. Furthermore, com-&#xD;
pared with this old gentleman she was a child, and taken in connection with&#xD;
his nephew shewas a young lady; and both as a child and a young lady she&#xD;
was under bonds to be fastidiously modest and to withhold herself from prying&#xD;
into their secrets.&#xD;
The Judge might have told her something of the matterhad it gone well;&#xD;
but it had turned into such an ugly and seemingly permanent skeleton that he&#xD;
did not wish to discourse of it to any one; and he had already acquired such&#xD;
a high opinion of this devout daughter of the "great and good Doctor Ber-&#xD;
nard" that he did not suspect her of being specially interested in his scape-&#xD;
grace nephew. Once, indeed, happening to note that she was gazing at him&#xD;
intently, he remembered how she had asked him to further a reconciliation;&#xD;
but with a blindness as to the inner character and motives of young ladies for&#xD;
which we can hardly forgive him, he only said to himself, " Benevolent nature!&#xD;
She must be her father over again. No, it is not nature; it is grace."&#xD;
Meantime the thought of the perverse Edward troubled his soul, and weighed&#xD;
down his prominent, sharp chin into his high stock, and filled his glassy eyes&#xD;
with stagnant speculation. It was observed by the family that he was much&#xD;
occupied during the rest of the day with business papers,-and that, he seemed&#xD;
to be drawing up some important document Next morning two gentlemen,&#xD;
known to be a lawyer and a banker, arrived in a buggy from New Haven, and&#xD;
were closeted with him for some minutes in his study. After their departure&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        55&#xD;
he summoned Mrs. Dinneford into the same minute apartment and showed her&#xD;
a long paper of a legal mien terminating in seals and signatures.&#xD;
"Cousin. Dorothy," he said, addressing her exceptionally by her christened&#xD;
name,, for usually he called her Mrs. Dinneford-" Cousin Dorothy, this is&#xD;
my will."&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford flushed and trembled; could not help hoping that she or&#xD;
Alice might get something; tried to feel ashamed of herself, and was deco-&#xD;
rously silent.&#xD;
"1 have parted my raiment of lucre into four portions," he continued tran-&#xD;
quilly. " One will go to religious and charitable institutions; one will go to&#xD;
yourself, my good and judicious cousin; one will go to Alice on her marriage,&#xD;
or at her twenty-fifth year; one will go to Walter Lehming."&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford had quivered from head to foot with a sort of painful joy&#xD;
when fortune began to pour its showers of gold 'in her direction; but as the&#xD;
old gentleman continued his statement she gradually lost her expression of&#xD;
pardonable satisfaction, and by the time he had finished her eyes were full&#xD;
of trouble.&#xD;
" And Edwcrd?" she asked with an unselfishness which was worshipful.&#xD;
Edward," returned the Judge slowly, his vitreous gaze fixed sadly on&#xD;
vacuity-" Edward will have nothing."&#xD;
"Oh, Cousin Wetherel! " exclaimed Mrs. Dinneford, in honest, beautiful&#xD;
distress.&#xD;
"My conscience will not let me do otherwise," declared the old gentleman,&#xD;
still staring straight before him into emptiness, as if determined not to see her&#xD;
imploring face.&#xD;
" Don't you love your nephew at all?" pleaded the excellent lady, with&#xD;
tears in her voice.&#xD;
"Money is the root of all evil," answered the Judge, so far disturbed that&#xD;
he sought to evade the query.&#xD;
" Yes, it is the root of all evil, but it may be a blessing in disguise," argued&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford, who sometimes had a quick-witted though half unconscious&#xD;
cleverness of speech. " What harm has it done you, Cousin Wetherel, or done&#xD;
through you? Providence has intrusted you with a great deal of it, and I am&#xD;
sure you would be puzzled to say how you have been the worse for the gift, or&#xD;
how your fellow creatures have suffered because of it."&#xD;
'"I have been helped, I have been restrained, I have been guided," said the&#xD;
old, man, looking upward in solemn gratitude. "Bat to those who cast oft&#xD;
grace money is always a root of evil. Money, more perhaps than any other&#xD;
thing else, has ruined Edward. Because lie came to his majority with fifty&#xD;
thousand dollars in his hands, he has never worked, he has been a spendthrift,&#xD;
and he has fallen into the pitfalls of vice."&#xD;
: "I hope that Edward has not spent all his fortune," murmured Mrs. Dinne-&#xD;
ford, ready to cry.&#xD;
"I believe that he has, and I trust that he has," returned .the Judge.&#xD;
"Nothing will save him from destruction but a life of enforced labor."&#xD;
"Oh, Cousin Wetherel!" groaned the good woman'again. ," And heex.'&#xD;
1iected to live so differently! Do give him-you know Alice and I have some-&#xD;
thing .of our own-do give him my share."&#xD;
"No!" said the millionaire, almost angrily. Unworldly as he was, or&#xD;
sought to be, he 'did not like to have his estate despised; and forrlt-moment he&#xD;
was inclined to take his kinswoman's generous proposition as a personal affront.&#xD;
&#xD;

56                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
In the next breath he admitted to himself that this feeling was wrong, and&#xD;
added in a gentle voice, " My dear Cousin Dorothy, you honor our family.&#xD;
But you must not urge me to give your dues to one who dishonors it."&#xD;
"This will make such trouble! " Mrs. Dinneford sighed. "I can't help&#xD;
quoting what Tupper says, severe as you may think it: 'There is no greater&#xD;
evil among men than a testament framed with injustice.'. And I agree  "&#xD;
"I deny the injustice," interrupted the Judge with a quickness of speech&#xD;
which was quite unusual with him, and which showed extreme irritation. "Is&#xD;
there any justice in giving God's benefits to the perversely ungodly?"&#xD;
"It will make such trouble! " repeated Mrs. Dinneford, falling back upon the&#xD;
personal argument. "Edward will certainly feel that we-Alice and I-have&#xD;
wronged him. He will suspect us of being selfish, mean, managing people."&#xD;
"I have stated in the will," explained the inexorable testator, "I have&#xD;
stated distinctly, that it was prepared without your knowledge or consent. I&#xD;
have also stated, with as much consideration as possible, my reasons for disin-&#xD;
heriting my nephew.- Now let me beg of you not to argue.with me further.&#xD;
I am very tired and must lie down."&#xD;
And, indeed, the old man looked not a little shaken, as if disinheriting his&#xD;
nearest relative and the only other extant Wetherel had been a great hardship&#xD;
to him, and had drawn largely upon the currents of life which still trickled in&#xD;
his timeworn organism.S&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
A WOOING PROPHETIC OF TROUBLE.&#xD;
Tim disinheritance 'of Edward and all those sorry doings of his which had&#xD;
led to it were kept secret from Nestoria; even the communicative Alice being&#xD;
erase to talking of the black sheep of the family, and of the tremendous pun-&#xD;
ishment which had overtaken his swartness..&#xD;
But while discretion is a virtue, it is not invariably a blessing to all whom&#xD;
it concerns; and things would have gone more comfortably and prosperously&#xD;
with the missionary's daughter had her friends been less reticent. Left in&#xD;
ignorance of the young plan's real character, she continued to judge him&#xD;
mainly by his courtesy and amiability to herself; to look upon his misunder-&#xD;
standing with his uncle as his misfortune, rather than the result of his faults;&#xD;
and to think of him all the more kindly because of that mysterious calamity.&#xD;
Yes, the quarrel gave him an additional attraction in her eyes; it enlisted for&#xD;
him the unworldly purity and unworn fervor of her sympathy; it drew on'&#xD;
that passion of pity which in woman's heart is so- near the fountains of affec-&#xD;
tion. She prayed by herself that this great trial might be made to end well&#xD;
for him, leading him on to be better in this life and happy in the next.&#xD;
And, naturally enough, the more she prayed for him, the purer and nobler he&#xD;
seemed to her, and the worthier of her liking.&#xD;
It was just after one of these entangling orisons in behalf of the young man&#xD;
that she met him again. Edward could not long, stay away from the house in&#xD;
which he had been arraigned, condemned, and sentenced. It seemed to have&#xD;
some such sad and angry attraction for him as the scene of a murder is said&#xD;
to have for the ghost of the murdered one. In his vindictive desperation he&#xD;
3raved to revisit Sea Lodge, there to scowl defiance at his calamity and the&#xD;
mian who'had inflicted it.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                          57&#xD;
" I will face my uncle down," he said to himself. "I will show him that&#xD;
I care not one straw for his money; that I can bear all he can lay upon me&#xD;
without iinching."&#xD;
But another sentiment, even stronger perhaps than wrath, drew him to the&#xD;
spot. lIe longed greatly to see. Nestoria; for since his outlawry by his own&#xD;
blood, he had thought of her more than ever; he had set her up in this allur-&#xD;
ing light, that she was the only friend he had left on earth; and lie looked&#xD;
forward to an interview with her- as a support and consolation. Not that he&#xD;
might make love to her, and much less ask for her in marriage. No, no; lie&#xD;
was too poor now to offer himself even to a chambermaid; and he said.to him-&#xD;
self over and over again that this dear little beauty deserved -all the tender-&#xD;
nesses of fortune.&#xD;
Such at least was his general feeling, the judgment of his moments of high-&#xD;
est wisdom. But there were other times when the hopefulness of youth and&#xD;
the stirring of the blood demanded, " Why not?" This simple, unworldly,&#xD;
unselfish child would surely have the nobility to love him in spite of penury,&#xD;
and the faith to wait for him until he could acquire the means to support her.&#xD;
With a seraph to labor for, he would labor better than for himself alone, and&#xD;
)scale the summit of success more quickly. " Perhaps," he murmured to him-&#xD;
self in these euchanted moments, " perhaps it would be well for us both."&#xD;
Only three days after the quarrel, this wild-headed and liot-lhearted youth&#xD;
stalked haughtily into the castle of that grim enchanter, one vave of whose&#xD;
wand had stripped him of his golden expectations and left him clothed in in-&#xD;
solvency. Ile was ready to do instant battle, no doubt of someunwise and&#xD;
calimitous sort, the iiioient he should meet his enemy. But he had scarcely&#xD;
entered the plainly-furnished parlor ere the Luciferian wrath and defiance&#xD;
faded from his brow. He beheld the innocent veet face and radiant golden&#xD;
hair of Nestoria.&#xD;
The girl smiled brightly; she had, by the way, a habit of welcoming her&#xD;
friends by merely smiling; it was one of her unconscious fascinations,&#xD;
You are a burst of sunshine," he said. " You light up the whole of this&#xD;
'doleful house."&#xD;
"I amil glad you have come," she replied, apparently accepting his com-&#xD;
plinent as a mere expression of friendship, and perhaps so accepting it be-&#xD;
cause she was accustomed to the superlatives of the East. " I saw your boat&#xD;
in the harbor, dodging about like one of the sea-birds, and wondered if it&#xD;
would stop here. Take this great chair," she added, dragging it toward him&#xD;
in a helpful way which was common with her. "You will have nobody but&#xD;
me to talk with. Mrs. Dinneford has gone to town to do the marketing, and&#xD;
Alice is driving with the Judge."&#xD;
"I am gi aid they are out," smiled Edward, pleased to be alone with-her,&#xD;
and forgetti hg his enemy.&#xD;
Nestoria glanced at him with a troubled air, innocently won ering why he&#xD;
was glad, and whether she might ask why. Affectionately anxious about him,&#xD;
and unable to suppose that a man would lightly express himself pleased to be&#xD;
ril of his relations, she suspected that the quarrel between uncle and nephew&#xD;
had fared from bad to worse. Her childlike face, hs iheapable of concealments.&#xD;
as the physiognomy of perfect innocence always is, revealed the discomfort of&#xD;
her thoughts.&#xD;
" What makes you look so sad?'" he asked. "Because I don't care to&#xD;
have my relations always 'in my lapP"&#xD;
&#xD;

58                  THE WETHEREL: AFFAIR.&#xD;
"It isn't that," she said. "Though that seems to me so-strange! I don't&#xD;
know that.I ought to tell you what I was worrying about. I And yet-I will--&#xD;
I must. You needn't answer my question if it is an improper one."I&#xD;
"What is it?" he inquired, as she again hesitated. " Is it about the diffi-&#xD;
culty with my uncle?"&#xD;
"Yes," whispered Nestoria, so terrible was the subject to her, and so&#xD;
breathless her interest in it.'                          .&#xD;
" We are on speaking terms now, but I am to have none of his property,"&#xD;
he stated dryly and plainly, feeling that such a tale of calamity and injustice&#xD;
required no garnish of rhetoric or elocution.&#xD;
"Oh!'" exclaimed Nestoria, looking entirely relieved and even happy, it&#xD;
was so much better than she had feared.&#xD;
"You seem pleased;" he commented with a sort of peevish surprise, closely&#xD;
bordering on vexation.I&#xD;
"I am pleased because you are on speaking terms," was hbr answer. "I&#xD;
could not bear to have two such kind friends of mine hold apart from each&#xD;
other."&#xD;
You must not misunderstand me;" he went on with creditable frankness.&#xD;
"We are not on genial speaking terms. Not much geniality in my uncle&#xD;
when people don't agree with him. I think he is hard, and he means to be&#xD;
hard."&#xD;
"lDoes lie?" sighed Nestoria. "I don't see how it can be so, he seems&#xD;
so just. But you know far more of this matter than I do. I know almost&#xD;
nothing. At any rate, if you see each other often, perhaps the trouble will&#xD;
wear away."&#xD;
"Little chance of it," lie muttered. "And meanwhile I haven't a cent in&#xD;
the world."&#xD;
He made this confession in such a drooping, desperate tone, that the girl&#xD;
could not but perceive that here was a great misfortune, at least in his&#xD;
opinion.&#xD;
"I am so sorry!" she said heartily, at the same time looking at him with&#xD;
profound pity, though wondering how he could be thus depressed by mere pov-&#xD;
erty. Then her face brightened, partly with her natural cheerfulness, and&#xD;
partly with a desire to console him, and she added spilling, " Well, we have&#xD;
the same destiny. We must both work for a living. I am going to teach&#xD;
school and paint fans."&#xD;
" And so will I work!" exclaimed Edward, thoroughly ashamed of his&#xD;
cowardice and sense of helplessness. He sprang to his feet and walked the&#xD;
room with a resolute step, repeating, "Yes, I will work. I'll work like a&#xD;
Trojan."&#xD;
Nestoria gazed at him with admiration, fully believing in his manliness&#xD;
and feeling a humble awe of it. Of a sudden he became in her eyes some-&#xD;
thing more than charming; he rose in one instant to be noble, heroic, and&#xD;
worshipful; and in that instant she loved him. Gentleness is fascinating to a&#xD;
woman, but strength is subduing. Nestoria had seen ,Edward courteous, and&#xD;
she had given him her earnest friendship; now she saw him, as she thought,.&#xD;
virile and mighty, and with a single throb she gave him her heart.&#xD;
Hie did indeed look noble, for the loftiness of worthy resolve was in his air,&#xD;
and the beautiful confidence of young and healthy manhood in his face, It&#xD;
seemed to himu at the moment that- he would indeed labor terribly, that he&#xD;
would deserve a success which should command the respect of his fellow&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                          -59&#xD;
creatures, and that he would (most bewitching thought of all) rise superior to&#xD;
that enemy, his uncle.&#xD;
Presently he glanced at Nestoria, and the instant his eyes met hers he was&#xD;
fascinated, for in their sincere azure he beheld her heart. The undisguisable&#xD;
sympathy and affection of that innocent gaze threw down all the battlements&#xD;
of his prudence as easily as the sunlight eats up the minutest drop of dew.&#xD;
The dandy, the practised beau, the worldling who supposed himself to be su-&#xD;
perbly selfish, the man-about-town who trusted that he was hardened, became&#xD;
in one breath 'i reckless lover.&#xD;
"My dear little friend, how good you are! " he said, walking straight up to&#xD;
her, and bending over her with brooding tenderness. " You do really care for&#xD;
my welfare."&#xD;
Nestoria co 1l not reply ; her heart was all at once full of terror; her voice&#xD;
was suffocated hj pulsations. She rose to her feet with difficulty, feeling that&#xD;
she ought to run away, but unable to go.&#xD;
'-lMy dear, dear child, I must love.you,"lhe went on, impelled by that head-&#xD;
long eagerness of his which made him always do what he wanted to do, re-&#xD;
gardless of consequences. " Will you let me? I am unworthy of it. But do&#xD;
let me. Do let mse hope that some day you will love me in return."&#xD;
By this time he had taken her hand, and we are compelled to confess that&#xD;
Nestoria was not wise enough .to withdraw it,. and indeed did not think of&#xD;
withdrawing it. She had lost all control of her destiny, and although she was&#xD;
crying a little, it was with happiness.&#xD;
"Oh! what are you crying for P" be asked, prodigiously troubled by the&#xD;
sight of a tear on. her cheek, for the tenderness of deep affection- possessed&#xD;
him. " Am I vexing you-paining you P?"&#xD;
She looked up in his face with such an expression of content and joy that&#xD;
lhe could not possibly mistake her feelings.&#xD;
"You surprise me so !" she whispered. "I didn't expect this. I didn't&#xD;
know&#xD;
" Then you will promise to wait for me P " he urged, eager for a complete&#xD;
answer, an unmistakable word.&#xD;
"But, Edward," she said, hesitating, "I want to ask you one question."&#xD;
What is it, Nestoria P "&#xD;
She put her mouth close to his ear and Whispered her query so low that he&#xD;
could scarcely hear it. The shy, yet anxious and solemn interrogatory was,&#xD;
whether he were a member of the church of Christ.&#xD;
He stared at her. A grave look come over his face. At last he said, "I&#xD;
am."&#xD;
" Oh ! " she sighed, relieved from a great terror. " I will wait all my life&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
We will describe this interview no further ; indeed, it only lasted a minute&#xD;
longer. Glancing accidentally out of a Wvindow, Edward saw Judge Wetherel&#xD;
drive up to the gate, too late to prevent a scene which, as we can easily un-&#xD;
derstand, might well be the first act in the drama of trouble,&#xD;
I'here is my uncle," he said, releasing Nestoria's hand. "I must tell&#xD;
him this at once."&#xD;
In his heart lie added, with spine anxiety as well as with some triumph,&#xD;
" How will he take it ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

60             THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
JUDGE WETHEREL, DISSENTS.&#xD;
JUDGE W ETIEREL entered the parlor in his usual deliberate, fashion, walk'&#xD;
ing with-some such sluggishness as if his boots were weightier than himself, of&#xD;
as if he were one of those sufferers whom.Dante saw toiling'through the Infer&#xD;
no in garments of lead.&#xD;
So imperfect was his eyesight, that he did not at first recognize his nephew&#xD;
and Nestoria as they stood up before him side by side, the girl tenderly pale&#xD;
and swaying like a lily on its stalk, while the young man, though flushed even&#xD;
to dizziness, was resolute and almost defiant. But the moment lie discerned&#xD;
who they were, lie seemed to divine that something unusual had happened,&#xD;
and coming to a halt lie gazed at them silently and fixedly. Behind him ap-&#xD;
peared Alice, equally speechless and curious, a little disturbed, too, at the sight&#xD;
of Edward, for she instantly remembered the will which enriched her to his&#xD;
impoverishment. In the midst of this crisis of suspense, Mrs. Dinneford alsc&#xD;
entered the room, cheerfully fresh and brisk from her errands in the city, but&#xD;
struck suddenly dumb by the tableau before her.&#xD;
Uncle, 1 have something to tell you," spoke out Edward, surely a young&#xD;
man of some moral stamina, whether for good or evil. " I have offered my-&#xD;
self to Miss Bernard, and she has accepted me."&#xD;
Judge Wetherel seemed to be stunned; for many seconds he preserved a&#xD;
perfect silence, staring glassily into vacancy; at last' he slowly enunciated, in&#xD;
a voice more than usually thin and ghostly, " What-does-this-mean?"&#xD;
Presently lie resumed, his sunken face blank with sorrowful amazement,&#xD;
"Is the eye of innocence really so blind?"&#xD;
After another pause he added, "I have neglected my duty. I must neglect&#xD;
it no longer."&#xD;
A wave of his sallow, shrivelled hand dismissed Mrs. Dinneford and Alice&#xD;
from the parlor. They did not want to go; their womanly hearts were eager&#xD;
to stay and help fight the battle of the two lovers; but that hand was as au-&#xD;
thoritative as the flauing sword which guarded the gate of Eden. Consider-&#xD;
ing the amiable though perhaps misjudging kindliiess of the feelings by which&#xD;
they were moved, we must pardon them for lingering in-the neighboring hall&#xD;
and tampering-with the fidelity of the keyhole.&#xD;
The Judge turned his eyes upon the Adam and Eve whom lie was about to&#xD;
expel from the paradise into which they had just stolen. Some men in his po-&#xD;
sition would have faltered, out of mere unreasoning pity and sympathy; or&#xD;
would have decided feebly that it was too late now to interfere, and that things&#xD;
must take their course.' But this man had abundance of iron in his clay ; he&#xD;
was braced up on the one hand by his solemn sense of duty, and on the other&#xD;
oy his long experience in laying the penalties of the law upon his fellow crea-&#xD;
tures; and between such an Aaron and such a Hur lie had no inclination and&#xD;
even no power to falter. He did not see before him two loving souls who&#xD;
would be wretched if they weredivided; he only saw a bewildered victim who&#xD;
must be saved, and a godless tempter who must be exorcised.&#xD;
"Edward, you. have abused iy hospitality," lie began in the impressive&#xD;
tone of one who knows that he is pronouncing just sentence. "You have vio-&#xD;
lated the sanctuary of my house. Because I have permitted you-to come hither&#xD;
in the hope that it might somehow result in your own .ood, you have come to&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                          61&#xD;
work mischief for others. A mere worldling, a man who has no part nor lot&#xD;
with the righteous, you are not worthy to be the companion of this innocent in-&#xD;
fant. Instead of being a comfort and a guide to her, you would be a thorn and&#xD;
a stimnlblingr-block.&#xD;
We can imagine the amazement and horror with which Nestoria listened&#xD;
to tliig speech. IHaving learned to believe in Judge.Wetherel, having accepted&#xD;
his caracter as perfect and his motives as pure and'his opinions as wise, she&#xD;
was disposed to receive all his words as infallible revelations; so that her first&#xD;
impulse now, as she watched his persuaded face and listened to -his solemn&#xD;
voice, was to credit every syllable of his accusation. She turned such a stare&#xD;
upon Edward.as if she had heard him convicted of murder or of atheism. But&#xD;
then came a revulsion ; this man, too, she had been brought to regard as alto-&#xD;
i ether lovely and of good report; the illusions of a love which was all inno-&#xD;
cence had clothed him in her eyes with innocence. Tn "an instant her confi-&#xD;
dence leaped toward hin again, Atnd she deemed that he was judged harshly&#xD;
if not wrongfully. These vacillations of belief and of feeling were too much&#xD;
for her strength; and with a dizzy consciousness that she had turned very&#xD;
white, she'sat down.&#xD;
Edward, meanwhile, was in a state of simple fury, no doubt justifiable&#xD;
enough in hisopinion, though lie did not stop to analyze it.&#xD;
" 1 oppose it gives you pleasure to cause all this misery," he said, looking&#xD;
straight in his uncle's face.&#xD;
"it gives me unspeakable grief," replied the Judge, his eyes fixed upon Nes-&#xD;
toria. "'Ihis is the very wretchieglest moment that you have ever caused me."&#xD;
his Voice shook a good deal here, and he paused until he could reiistablish it.&#xD;
E(lward," he resumed, " I cannot talk to you, nor in your presence. I&#xD;
must beg you to leave."&#xD;
The young man did not stir; he simply gazed at Nestoria.&#xD;
"I must insist upon your leaving me," continued the old gentleman in a&#xD;
louder tone. " This lady is my guest, and in a manner my ward. This is,&#xD;
my house, sir. I know my legal, rights. Will you recognize them or not ?"&#xD;
4 Yes," answered Edward, choking with rage. "I came here with your&#xD;
permission, but I will go at your order. Understand this, however, that I am&#xD;
betrothed to this lady, and that I have a right to meet her otherwheres. Nes-&#xD;
toria, I must go now," he added; turning to the girl. "But I will see you&#xD;
again. .I will write. Don't be my enemy. Can't you answer me?"&#xD;
If we have given the impression hitherto that Nestoria was deficient in&#xD;
moral and intellectual force, we have done her injustice. Little as she was,&#xD;
and childlike in appearance, and ignorant of what people call the world, she&#xD;
had, perhaps, more character than most girls of her age, and under the spur of&#xD;
necessity could summon up notable self-possession and bravery. Notwith-&#xD;
standing her present great fright aid unprecedented trouble, she found now&#xD;
just the right word to impose upon these two exasperated men, and to bring&#xD;
this woful scene to a close.&#xD;
" All this must go before my father, Edward," she said with quiet firmness,&#xD;
though she seemed to herself to be speaking out of some horrible, hopeless&#xD;
abyss. " Of course, you knew all the while that he must decide."&#xD;
"Yes, he must decide," conceded Judge Wetherel, always and instantly&#xD;
subordmnate to authorities which the lawv recognizes.&#xD;
"1 must ask you to wait, Edward," she continued. -" Can't you wait for&#xD;
me? I. was willing and am willing to wait for you."&#xD;

62                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
The young man took her hand and bowed over it with the humble worship&#xD;
of a lover who has no present chance to boast great things of himself, and who&#xD;
discovers in the object of his affection moral qualities which can make his hap-&#xD;
piness. For the first time this charming child appeared to him not merely&#xD;
beautiful, but also august. It was for her sake alone that he turned to his un-&#xD;
cle before he left the room and uttered some civil words of farewell.&#xD;
"Good-morning, sir," ceremoniously replied the old gentleman. le had&#xD;
meant to say that for the present there must be no writing between them; but&#xD;
in the worry and hurry of the ugly occasion he entirely forgot that bit of duty.,&#xD;
His physical weakness asserted itself as soon as Edward had departed, and he&#xD;
sat down suddenly with an air of utter exhaustion, tremulous decadence, and&#xD;
pallid decay, so that a person of vivid fancy might almost have looked to see&#xD;
him collapse and crumble into dust.&#xD;
Nestoria brought him a glass-of water, and he swallowed with shaking ea-&#xD;
gerness, as a drunkard would have gulped brandy..&#xD;
"Olh, how I have troubled you!" whispered this unselfish child.&#xD;
"My dear, what will your father say to this?" was his answer. "What&#xD;
will Doctor Bernard think of me?2 " .    .&#xD;
"Is not Edward a member of the church?" asked Nestoria.&#xD;
The Jidge stared at her without responding; the question seemed to per-&#xD;
plex and silence him.&#xD;
"le told me so," she added, trembling with anxiety.&#xD;
"I believe he is," at last answered the Judge, and fell back into speechless-&#xD;
ness..&#xD;
Let us inquire for ourselves what the young man had meant and how much&#xD;
he had meant when he made this statement to the girl. le had told the sim-&#xD;
ple truth; it was a fact that lie had passed through the ceremony of confirma-&#xD;
tion at an early age; he could still remember with a smile.his sensations of&#xD;
awe under the pressure of episcopal hands. But that was all, for the scene&#xD;
had exercised no influence over his life, and lie had always considered it a&#xD;
mere form.&#xD;
At the same time he did not mean.to deceive Nestoria. Mach as he liked&#xD;
her, and much as he had sought to divine her nature, he did not really under-&#xD;
stand her. The urgency of her devotional sentiments was as far beyond his&#xD;
perceptions as if he had been a monkey; and indeed he could not have&#xD;
imagined, without assistance, that any girl would accept or decline marriage&#xD;
because of religious scruples. In short, church rnemb/ership was to him a sim-&#xD;
ple decorum,. a matter of etiquette and deportment aid breeding, which some&#xD;
people thought urgent and others not. Ruled by these ideas, he had stared in&#xD;
surprise at Nestoria's unexpected query, and had answered it with straightfor-&#xD;
wvard, simple directness, confining himself to the bare fact of the case. We&#xD;
must add in his favor that at the same time he felt an impulse, perhaps tran-&#xD;
itory enough in its character, to become more worthy of his decorous profes-&#xD;
ion than lie had been, and at all events more worthy of this angelic catechist.&#xD;
Let us return now to the interview between the Judge and Nestoria. The&#xD;
old man was singularly perplexed; as was natural, lie did not like to blacken&#xD;
the name of one who was both a representative of his family, and even in some&#xD;
outward manner of his faith; and between his conscientious tenderness and his&#xD;
conscientious severity he vacillated long.&#xD;
" Did you question him concerning this matterr" he finally asked.&#xD;
"Yes," said Nestoria.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR..                        63&#xD;
"It was well," bowed the Judge. "Did he tell you any more than the sim-&#xD;
ple fact? Did lie claim to be worthy of his high title?"&#xD;
"No," said Nestoria. "Are we any of us worthy?"&#xD;
"None of 'us," answered the old man. "But there are some who seek to&#xD;
be so, and others who seek not. I fear-yes, I will honestly say that I believe&#xD;
that Edward is of these last."&#xD;
Nestoria's eyes filled with tears, and she laid her head suddenly on a table&#xD;
hiding her face .with her hands.&#xD;
"Are you sure that he will not change?" she presently asked, without&#xD;
looking up.&#xD;
"The mercy of God is especially for the chief of sinners," responded the&#xD;
Judge, his self-command giving way at last, and his voice breaking into a sob.&#xD;
"My child, we will both of us pray and labor'for this man," he resumed after&#xD;
a struggle. ".Peradventure Heaven will hear us. These chastisements, and&#xD;
this new desire of his may work for his good. We will not despair of him. I&#xD;
have despaired, but a vision seems to tell me now that I was wrong, and&#xD;
that I must let, patience and hope have their perfect work. As for what con,.&#xD;
-cerns you, we will leave all with your father. We must wait. It is every way&#xD;
a necessity. Edward has no property and no profession. He must find some&#xD;
means of existence before he can take one step forward."&#xD;
"So he told me," said Nestoria, glad that she could show forth Edward's&#xD;
veracity and frankness.&#xD;
"Perhaps I have done him injustice," muttered the old man. He said it to&#xD;
himself, but the-gentle doubt was not lost upon the girl, and she left the room&#xD;
almost happy, so cheering and deluding is love.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
A COUNT'S PIIILOSOPHIZINGS.&#xD;
- W   HO among us, that remembers distinctly his or her salad days, dare&#xD;
affirm that yopth is wise enough for its needs?&#xD;
The youthfulness of Edward Wetherel was certainly not ballasted with&#xD;
sufficing wisdom. A patient escaped -from a lunatic asylum could iardlytdo&#xD;
worse than waste all his money, spurn an easy chance of obtaining a gratui-&#xD;
tous million, and then offer himself to a girl without a penny. So much, we&#xD;
may monitorially add in passing, for indulging a headstrong will and a greedy&#xD;
taste for pleasures. Excellent characteristics are the impulses, when intelli-&#xD;
gently directed-capable of making a man nobly virile in himself and a bene-&#xD;
factor of his fellows;- but, while praiseworthily useful as servants, ruinous as&#xD;
masters.&#xD;
Notwithstanding all his obvious blunders and the calamities which had so,&#xD;
frankly .issued out of them, Edward still could not learn to put a bridle upon&#xD;
his impetuous and obstinate disposition. He left his uncle's house as pugna-&#xD;
cious, as determined to have his own will, and as eager to gratify his emotions,&#xD;
as if he had always been the luckiest of mortals. As he put back across the&#xD;
harbor to his lodging jlace, he kept all sail up indefiance of a stiff breeze and&#xD;
heavy sea, taking a desperate satisfaction in running the risk of drowning. 'le&#xD;
plunge of his light boat into the curling heads of foam gratified him; it seemed&#xD;
to hin as if lie were striking opponents and enemies in the face. Landing in&#xD;
a half-soaked condition, he joined his two fellow-lodgers in a smoke, and re"&#xD;
fused to change his clothes.&#xD;
"Byronic," scoffed Wolverton, with kindly intentions. "You will out-&#xD;
grow that sort of thing some of these days."&#xD;
"I believe that I am a real man enough, as far as I go," answered Ed-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
"wThat is very true," admitted Wolverton, who liked the youngster, and&#xD;
thought him on the whole a superior fellow. "I don't mean that you habitu-&#xD;
ally exult in sorrow, and 'don't charge you at all with putting on a fancy-ball&#xD;
melancholy. But, for all your sincerity, you had better dry yourself. Rheu-&#xD;
matisn doesn't help matters."&#xD;
" Oh, let me alone awhile,'*.sulked Edward.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                          65&#xD;
'We must not laugh at the world-sorrow," put in the Count, who had&#xD;
Ibeard the above conversation with disapproval, both as a philosopher and as a&#xD;
literary critic. " You practical Anglo-Saxons delight to laugh at it; you call&#xD;
great Byron humbug because he felt it and sang it. But you are wrong. The&#xD;
world-sorrow is a true and beautiful emotion. I cannot boast of it; but I re-&#xD;
spect it. The illimitable .Shakespeare divined and described it. The inclan-&#xD;
clioly of Hamlet comes not altogether from his troubles; it is partly world-&#xD;
sorrow. When we behold that great drama from this one of its many sides,&#xD;
we see thatHamlet was .in part a prophecy of Rousseau and Byron. There is&#xD;
nothing great in the sentimental cosmos that the illimitable Shakespeare has&#xD;
not-foretold or recounted. He knew the past and the future, the fact and the&#xD;
possibility of the man-soul; and he, the all-enfolding, the highest known in-&#xD;
tellect, speaks not contemptuously of the world-sorrow."&#xD;
The Count was neither talking to show off his erudition, nor to hear the&#xD;
sound of his own voice. He had'risen to his feet to make his remarks, and he&#xD;
uttered them in a manner' of unmistakable earnestness, gesturing the while&#xD;
with his lighted cigar, and glancing from face to face of his auditors. Mean-&#xD;
lime the two A iericans stared at him with what they considered a suitable&#xD;
mixture, of candid contempt and wonder.&#xD;
"Poloski, you puzzle me," said Wolverton frankly. "You are a fdneur&#xD;
like 1 yself, and yet you are a philosopher and a linguist. I don't see how&#xD;
you iix such opposite fancies."&#xD;
T ie Count's lip curled slightly, and, notwithstanding his habitual civility,&#xD;
he hi d an air for one moment of despising his companions.&#xD;
" Why should not afaneur be also a great man?" he asked. " Csar was&#xD;
a dandy. You Americans are not many-si'ed enough. It is not that you&#xD;
have not brains individually.  It is tle defect of your intellectual atmos-&#xD;
phere. There is in it no variety of culture. It is not so in Europe. Look at&#xD;
me-what you call a dandy--I know seven languages, and have written&#xD;
brochures on them all, and now I am preparing a great work on the Origins&#xD;
of Spechc"&amp;amp;&#xD;
"Honest?" asked Wetherel, looking up from his brooding, and thinking in&#xD;
a practical way that if he knew as much as Poloski, he too would write a great&#xD;
work and make money (as learned, men always do), and so have funds to mar-&#xD;
ry on.y                                        n       e      t&#xD;
"Honest!" repeated the Count in high dudgeon."Have you thought me&#xD;
a humbug? I could show you all my brochures, only for ny misfortunes. A&#xD;
robber of a hotel-keeper seized my baggage and sold it to pay his rascally lit-&#xD;
tle bill. All my writings were lost!" he sighed with indisputable grief.ally&#xD;
Origins of Speech is only begun, But I will show you soie day-I will show&#xD;
you!"&#xD;
Can ve 'believe the Count? Yes, we must in some measure credit his&#xD;
statements; lie was really a linguist, and, to a certain extent, a scholar. A&#xD;
native of Posen (it is supposed), Polish and German were mother tongues to&#xD;
him, and lie ais acquired more or less knowledge of several other languages.&#xD;
As to thle various queer essays of whIich lie bostdwehae ngortcon&#xD;
cerning them but his own; and as to his havingreadwthen before royal and&#xD;
imperial societies, respectful doubt is at least permissible. His work, ho w-&#xD;
ever, on the Origins of Speech was not a myth; and fragments of it did event-&#xD;
nally astonish and delude superficial pundits.&#xD;
"Well, you are too deep for us," confessed Wolverton, with .lazy modesty~&#xD;
&#xD;

66                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"I can't discuss philology with you. And here is Wetherel going uncom-&#xD;
forted:."&#xD;
Let him study the*'science .of language, and he will be comforted," de&#xD;
cared the Count. " What is the matter with Wetberel?"&#xD;
"I am the victim of rich relatives," said Edward, with a bitter attempt a:&#xD;
defiant gayety. "My uncle has robbed me of his fortune."&#xD;
"Is he rich, your'uncle?" asked Poloski, deeply interested, as he always-&#xD;
was at the mention of wealth.&#xD;
"Worth a million," sulkily responded Edward, remembering that he would&#xD;
have none of it.&#xD;
"What!" exclaimed the Count. "And lives in that' little house? He&#xD;
should have a castle. Of course he is not imprudent enough to keep much&#xD;
money in that coop."&#xD;
"Rolls in a bin of it every night," asserted Edward. "Don't you wish he&#xD;
played poker?"&#xD;
"1Why have you not taken me there again? " asked Poloski. "I wanted&#xD;
once more-with your permission-to see the charming Miss Alice."&#xD;
"I have piloted you over twice, my Leander."&#xD;
" True. I am under infinite obligations. But the second time we found&#xD;
not the young ladies, and you would not introduce me to the house."&#xD;
"6Never mind, Count. No disrespect intended. I have scarcely been al-&#xD;
lowed to introduce myself."'&#xD;
" And have you been really disinherited? "&#xD;
"Yes," laughed Edward, with what joy in the merriment we can imagine.&#xD;
"The monster!" said the Count. "It is a case far worse than world-sor-&#xD;
brow."&#xD;
After remaining for some time in meditation, he added, " Then you will&#xD;
not go there more?"&#xD;
"No," returned/Edward.h&#xD;
That very day the noble Poloski took his departure, explaining that he had&#xD;
urgent afitirs in New York.&#xD;
" You won't play with him," suggested Edward to Wolverton; " and he&#xD;
takes it for granted that I haven't much more to lose."&#xD;
" I don't think that is the whole of it," returned Wolverton. " The dead-&#xD;
beat was after your cousin Alice; but of course, if you are not going over&#xD;
there, he has lost his chance of getting a footing in the family; and he isn't&#xD;
the fellow to waste his time in sighing across a harbor. We shall hear of him&#xD;
courting some other girl's bank account. I'm glad he's gone. Hadn't we&#xD;
better go too?"&#xD;
I will go on to New Haven with you," said Wetherel.&#xD;
"Why not to Newport?" ,&#xD;
" I can't afford it. I must save my money-or rather your money. Can't&#xD;
make you understand that I am dished and must study a profession?" he&#xD;
added irritably. " I'll go to New Haven and pick out my boarding-house&#xD;
there and get used to it. I must be a sawbones. It is the only business that&#xD;
I take the least fancy to. And I may as-well study in New Haven as any-&#xD;
where else."&#xD;
"Better," added-Wolverton. "You will be near your uncle, and huk may&#xD;
bring the old man around, if he sees you now and then. New Havent i just&#xD;
the place for you," he declared, viewing Wetherel's gloomy prospects cee&#xD;
fully, as the kindest of us are apt to view the burdens of our fellows. "el&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        67&#xD;
suppose we quit here on Saturday. I'll stop over with you a cay or two in&#xD;
New Haven, and see you settled. Any money that you want, you know, just&#xD;
call on me. I can't help thinking that this affair will come around all right&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
"yPerhaps so," grumbled Edward. "I can't feel so confident as you can.&#xD;
Perhaps because the troubles are mine, instead of yours. However, I'm greatly&#xD;
oblged to you. We will start when you say."&#xD;
Thus it was that the young man came to be still in the neighborhood of&#xD;
Sea Lodge when the bloody footstep of the " Wetherel Mystery ' appeared on&#xD;
its threshold.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
ANOTHER LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT.&#xD;
THE Wetherel household, habitually in a state of 'twilight seriousness had&#xD;
descended into a still lower and more darkling atmosphere, as if the shadow&#xD;
of the oncoming tragedy were already stealing over it.&#xD;
Every member of the family was occupied with sorrowful meditations and&#xD;
exercises concerning the luckless drama of Nestoria and Edward. The girl&#xD;
herself was of course in a state of worry about her lover; sometimes believing&#xD;
that he was good, and even very good, and at all events too good for0her ;&#xD;
sometimes fearing lest she should discover him to be one of those with whom&#xD;
conscientious spirits must not hold companionship. She made no public moan,&#xD;
indeed, being too modest to parade her griefs and too self-sustaining to lay&#xD;
them on the shoulders of others; but her cheek had 'faded a little, and her eyes&#xD;
had lost somewhat of their lucid brightness, so that her watchful friends knew&#xD;
that she wept in secret. Mrs. Dinneford and" Alice sorrowed for her, though&#xD;
not without hope, for they were women of the good old womanly sort, who held&#xD;
in the main that a love affair must have a blessed ending. The Judge appeared&#xD;
outwardly more shaken than anybody else; his habitual solemnity had degen-&#xD;
erated into an absent-minded anxiety, his face unusually wan and his step for-&#xD;
bodingly feeble.&#xD;
"Uncle is more than half sick," observed Alice to her another. " And I&#xD;
am glad of it. He is-.too hard to put up with."&#xD;
" Hush, my child," returned Mrs. Dinneford. "Cousin Wetherel looks at&#xD;
everything through his sense of duty. Edward has certainly been a wild boy;&#xD;
and I dare say he might make a very bad use of the property, if he should get&#xD;
it; and I sometimes must think of him in Tuppei's wonderful words, 'Behold&#xD;
the simple did sow and hath reaped the right harvest of folly'; and as for&#xD;
his marrying Nestoria, he might make her dreadfully unhappy, you know&#xD;
though I'm sure I hope not; and finally, how in the world could he  ossibl&#xD;
support her? Why, the poor child might have to go to teaching school and&#xD;
painting her fans to keep him out of the poorhouse. Dear me, when I think&#xD;
of it all I feel that we ought to be angry with Edward instead of with Cousin&#xD;
Wetherel, though nature. inclines the other way. Young men are so attrac-&#xD;
tive!"&#xD;
" It is a horrid muddle," fretted Alice. "Why wasn't Nestoria warned?"&#xD;
she added, quite forgetting her own responsibility in the matter. " Here you&#xD;
kew you venerable people, that Edward was a flibbertigibbet, and never told&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6242-00000035"/>&#xD;
68                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"Who could have guessed how things were going?" groaned the elder&#xD;
woman. "The ways of Providence are dreadfully mysterious; too much so&#xD;
for' some of us poor mortals. I sometimes think they were laid out without&#xD;
the least regard to us. We are left to look out for ourselves just as much as&#xD;
if we were rats and puppies, with a lot of Chinamen going to and fro to make&#xD;
pies of us. If we can keep out of the way, very good; and if we can't, we are&#xD;
devoured, and that's the end of it."&#xD;
" Don't bring Providence into the squabble," protested Alice. "The whole&#xD;
fault of the present muss lies with Uncle Wetherel. He could clear 'up mat-&#xD;
ters if he wanted to. He ought to settle a hundred thousand dollars on them,&#xD;
and tie up the money so that Edward couldn't spend it, and let them be mar-&#xD;
ried. They would get along as well as half the people. Somebody says that&#xD;
reformed rakes make the best husbands."&#xD;
" Perhaps so-if they ever do reform."&#xD;
And Mrs. Dinneford shook her head seriously, for Alice was a little too,&#xD;
much given to favoring rakes.&#xD;
During two days the only complaint which Nestoria uttered concerning&#xD;
her troubles was a confession that Sea Lodge had become a sad place to her.&#xD;
"I cannot stay here much longer," she sighed. " I love you all, but I&#xD;
must go."&#xD;
"Oh, no!" implored Mrs. Dinneford. "Not yet awhile. Stay with us&#xD;
till the vacations are over. There is no- sense in your going till you have got&#xD;
a place."&#xD;
And Alice added, with the headlong fervor of youthful friendship, ' There&#xD;
is no sense in your going ever."&#xD;
".Do help me then to find a place," was Nestoria's piteous answer.'&#xD;
Let us inquire a little more, minutely than we have hitherto done into this&#xD;
extravagant mystery of the affection of a pure and conscientious soul for one&#xD;
whom Judge Wetherel numbered not unfairly among the sons of Belial. Se-&#xD;
rious people will be ready to affirm that a thoroughly good girl cannot trust&#xD;
and admire and love a bad man. In a general way this is true; the saintly&#xD;
do not incline toward the openly corrupt; they instinctively dislike and avoid&#xD;
them. But we must remember that when the wolves put on sheep's clothing,&#xD;
they often enter the fold without difficulty and are well received among the&#xD;
flock. Now, as far as Nestoria had seen or could perceive, Edward Wetherel&#xD;
was vestured in the very purest and whitest of lambs' wool, such as might&#xD;
have served for the covering of a prophet or high priest. As gentle and cour-&#xD;
teous as any missionary, and in her hearing as becoming in conversation, she&#xD;
classed him with the worthy souls among whom she had been educated, and&#xD;
could not possibly think of him as on a par with the heathen. The 'mere fact&#xD;
that he wore European clothing was a certificate of good character in the eyes&#xD;
of a child who had rarely seen a wicked man without a turban, loose robes,&#xD;
and a shawl full of firearms.&#xD;
It might seem that she had received warnings and hints enough concern-&#xD;
ing Edward to make her comprehend clearly that he was a scapegrace. But&#xD;
innocence isvery dull in the matter of understanding insinuations as to evil.&#xD;
It has sometimes occurred to me that the angels who abide permanently in&#xD;
heaven must be exceedingly incredulous and hard to instruct concerning. the&#xD;
wickedness, of our planet. Difficult as the thing is to accept, we must be con-&#xD;
tented to receive it as a fact (and it seems to me a fact of great beauty and&#xD;
pathos) that Nestoria had not comprehended much of what the Judge had said&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         69&#xD;
to her against his nephew. The two men had disagreed, and that certainly&#xD;
was a very lamentable business; but which was darkly to blame she could not&#xD;
tell, and she charitably, sweetly hoped, neither..&#xD;
Well, what must she' do? Of course she must eventually leave all with&#xD;
her father, that entirely wise and good being, that representative to her of Deity.&#xD;
But meantime was she to hear and see nothing of Edward? It was improba-&#xD;
ble that he would come again to his uncle's house; and after bearing his ab-&#xD;
sence for a day or two, she could not help writing to him.&#xD;
" My dear, dear friend," she began, "what shall I say to you? We must&#xD;
wait, and you must have patience; can't you? I hope and believe that you&#xD;
trust me, notwithstanding that you cannot see me. You may confide in me&#xD;
thoroughly. I have thought this matter all over, and, my dear, dear friend, I&#xD;
have prayed over it, and it seems to me that I have received some light upon&#xD;
it. When I remember how we were allowed to meet, and to learn to believe&#xD;
in each other, until it was too late to disbelieve, it seems to me that we were&#xD;
led by a mighty hand, a hand reaching from'the.other world. I think so with&#xD;
frequent trembling, and yet with prevailing cheerfulness. And so I shall keep&#xD;
my promise to.you, in spite of your good uncle's warning. My dear, dear&#xD;
friend, the friend that has come nearest to my heart of any on earth, if you&#xD;
have not been always a good man heretofore, you must be a good man hencefor-&#xD;
ward for my sake, as well as for far greater motives. I wilLnot write any more,&#xD;
for perhaps I ought not., But I could not help writing this. What I have to&#xD;
ask you, then, is to have patience until we can hear from my father. Is it too&#xD;
much?&#xD;
"Yours always,&#xD;
. ' "NESTOMA."&#xD;
This letter she showed to Mrs. Dinneford, who read it with moist eyes&#xD;
-and sent it.&#xD;
"If the Lord," said the good lady to herself, "if the Lord doesn't take care&#xD;
of that child, I don't know whom 4he will take care of. And if Edward doesn't&#xD;
turn a sharp corner now and make a decent man of himself, lie ought to be-&#xD;
hung! I wish I could lock him up. We put dumb creatures into yokes and&#xD;
pokes when they are unruly. Edward is just as fit to. run about alone as a&#xD;
truant goose or a hooking cow. And here I can't blow a warning trumpet&#xD;
against him in this poor child's ear, for fear of worrying her. I never had&#xD;
anybody take such, a hold of my feelings. . Well, there is one comfort in it,&#xD;
she may have got the same hold of Edward."&#xD;
I suspect that most of us ait like Mrs. Dinneford in finding it difficult to&#xD;
deal faithfully with pretty and agreeable, persons. Indeed, it'strikes one as a&#xD;
general reflection of much weight, that Providence has been kind to the human&#xD;
race in making many plain women. If all the representatives of that exacting&#xD;
sex were beautiful and captivating, men would hardly ever be masters of their&#xD;
own minds and actions; they would be constantly on the go to please some&#xD;
irresistible charmer, and ,they would have neither thought nor time for the&#xD;
virile labors of life, so that politics, business, and possibly civilization alto-&#xD;

leaves.&#xD;
Judge Wetherel himself, that incarnate case of conscience, who was ac-&#xD;
customed to denounce beauty as a (delusion and a snare, was spiritually be-&#xD;
numbed to an amazinig extent by Nestorid's graces. It was mainly because&#xD;
her sweet smile and golden hair reminded him of seraphs that lie could not&#xD;

warn her frankly that she had thrown her pearls of affection 'before the un-&#xD;
clean, and command her strenuously to withdraw the precious offering. At&#xD;
last it was borne in upon him that, if his nephew was to be this child's detri-&#xD;
ment, he ought to be her salvation, at least in a worldly sense; and thus he&#xD;
came to conceive the idea of leaving her fifty thousand dollars or so, the said&#xD;
legacy to be secured to her, by a trusteeship, so that her husband might not&#xD;
waste it.&#xD;
This generous plan he in fact decided upon. During the evening he com-&#xD;
menced drawing up a new will. He was so eager about it that instead of&#xD;
going to bed at nine o'clock, according to his prudent custom, he sat in his&#xD;
study until. long afterward, slowly tracing out his good deed in his large, for-&#xD;
mal, conscientious handwriting. At half past ten he was still busy, for both&#xD;
mind and hand were somewhat stiffened by age, and he could only work&#xD;
slowly. One by one the others retired, leaving him alone with his benevo-&#xD;
lence.&#xD;
" Cousin Wetherel, take care of your eyes," said Mrs. Dinneford, entering&#xD;
the study to bid him good-night. "You can't labor as you could once."&#xD;
"Do not interrupt me," replied the old man. "I must do with my might&#xD;
what my hand findeth to do. The night cometh when no man can work."&#xD;
"But the morning cometh also," observed Mrs. Dinneford, who was ac,&#xD;
customed to talk with her relative in his town Biblical way.&#xD;
"We know not the plans of Providence," said the Judge. "I have always&#xD;
endeavored to labor as if each day were to be my last. Suffer me to go on.".&#xD;
"You are altering your will! " exclaimed the good lady, her large blue&#xD;
eyes. opening so wide with delight that her spectacles were a very close fit.&#xD;
"Cousin Wetherel, I am rejoiced. I do hope poor Edward is to have some-&#xD;
thing to keep him off the town."&#xD;
"-A pretty reason for giving a man wealth because he is of the almshouse&#xD;
sort!" grumbled the old gentleman, a shrewd economist and financier, be it&#xD;
observed, and necessarily somewhat scornful of those who were not. "Cousin&#xD;
Dinneford," he added, in a humorously pettish tone, "if you cannot sleep with-&#xD;
out learning what I am doing, be it known to you that I am bequeathing a&#xD;
support to this damsel who has found her sojourn under my roof such a pitfall&#xD;
to her feet."&#xD;
"Nestoria!" fairly laughed Mrs. Dinneford. " Cousin Wetherel, the Lord&#xD;
speed you! I won't delay you another minute., Do finish it and sign it."&#xD;
"There must be witnesses," answered the Judge. "And we have none&#xD;
here of a proper status. To-morrow, if Providence permit, all shall be done&#xD;
in order and with punctuality.",            -&#xD;
"iWell, to-morrow," smiled' Mrs. Dinneford. " Good-night, Cousin Weth-&#xD;
erel."&#xD;
She nastened up stairs, looked in upon Alice to tell her the good news,&#xD;
found the girl asleep, and went to her own room.&#xD;
The house fell silent. Only in the Judge's study, situated, we must re-&#xD;
member, upon the ground floor, was there a light burning. After a time this&#xD;
too disappeared; the mystery of a night without moon or stars settled upon&#xD;
the dwelling; there was a darkness such as they love whose deeds are evil.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.           71&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE MURDER.&#xD;
No sound had disturbed any sleeper in Sea Lodge with the revelation or&#xD;
with so much as the suggestion of a tragedy.&#xD;
And yet a stroke of deadly violence, as cruel and conclusive as the crunch&#xD;
of a headsmau's axe, had fallen; and in one of the rooms of this summer pleas-&#xD;
ure-house a corpse watched with wide-open, glassy eyes for the morning.&#xD;
During all the latter hours of the night it stared into the darkness, utterly un-&#xD;
known and unsuspected to the living who were so near it, so that it seemed to&#xD;
be lying in wait to surprise and shock and terrify them, and this too although&#xD;
it wore the guise of one who had loved them. From certain points of view&#xD;
there is something vampire-like, something uncomfortably hostile and fero-&#xD;
cious, in a dead body. To the living, so far at least as concerns their con-&#xD;
tinuance in physical life, it is a menace and a prophet of evil.&#xD;
The victim  was not Mrs. Dinneford; she had slept ,that slumber from&#xD;
which we wake. But some oppressive thing in the air of the house, some sub,&#xD;
tle influence which was unfriendly to prolonged repose, aroused her at an un-&#xD;
usually early hour; and unable to close her eyes again, she got up and dressed&#xD;
herself hastily, meaning to go out and breathe the refreshment of dawn,&#xD;
First, however, she peeped into her daughter's room, as was her motherly&#xD;
custom of mornings, to see if the girl .slept well. Next, the doors of the&#xD;
sleeping apartments being all open on account of the summer heat, she went&#xD;
Softly to take a like kindly glance at Nestoria.&#xD;
To her astonishment she found the room of the guest empty and the bed&#xD;
undisturbed. Alarmed at once (tender-hearted women are so easily anxious),&#xD;
she hurried to a window, peered out in all directions, and called, first gently&#xD;
and then louder, "Nestoria!"&#xD;
No answer came from within or without; and Mrs. Dinneford, throbbing&#xD;
with agitation, ran down stairs to continue her search; fearful goblins of sus-&#xD;
picion meanwhile following her fast with such queries as,- Sickness? Insanity ?&#xD;
Edward? Had the dear child been taken suddenly and dangerously ill ? Had&#xD;
her perplexities unsettled her mind and sent, her out wandering? . Had the&#xD;
headlong and ill-starred Edward so far abused her inexperience and innocence&#xD;
as to draw her into an elopement? Mrs. Dinneford could think of no other&#xD;
explanations for this extraordinary disappearance.&#xD;
On reaching the lower floor of the still quiet and silent cottage, it occurred&#xD;
to her that she would do well to awaken the Judge and inform him of what&#xD;
had happened. But in passing through the parlor on the way to his bedroom&#xD;
she chanced to look into the study, and there, to her amazement, she beheld&#xD;
her venerable kinsman seated in his office chair. His back was toward her,&#xD;
his body leaning forward, his arms and head resting upon his writing-table,&#xD;
his silver hair hanging loosely about his face, and his whole attitude that of&#xD;
'deep slumber,&#xD;
" Why, Cousin Wetherel!" exclaimed, or rather screamed Mrs. Dinneford,&#xD;
" Have you been here all night?"&#xD;
The Judge did not stir; his sleep was awfully, alarmingly profound; and&#xD;
of a sudden the wondering woman became tremulous with fright. Was it a&#xD;
fainting fit, or was it apoplexy? Forgetting all about Nestoria, she advanced&#xD;
hastily to the old man and laid her hand upon his shoulder. In the next in--&#xD;
dtant she snatched it away and shrieked withm all her strength, " Murder! "&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6242-00000037"/>&#xD;
72                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
The terrible cry awakened or startled all tle members of the family,&#xD;
and brought them one by one into the room, flurried, amazed, and staring.&#xD;
The first living person of whom Mrs. Dinneford became aware was the&#xD;
gardener, a quiet, silent, and somewhat stolid man, of the lowly-born Eng-&#xD;
lish type.&#xD;
"Oh, James, he has been killed! see the blood!" hurriedly and mechan-&#xD;
ically gasped the horror-stricken woman.&#xD;
James advanced to the unmoving body, surveyed with profound ,solemnity&#xD;
a large crimson, clotted pool on the writing-table, passed an unflinching horny&#xD;
hand over a white, cold face, and touched with one finger a gash in the hoary&#xD;
crown. There wns no question about the remorseless completeness- of the&#xD;
sanguinary work. The severe and somewhat sunless, but conscientious, benev-&#xD;
olent, and on the whole beautiful life had ended; and the sincere spirit of the&#xD;
old man, purified through worthy work and worthier aspirations, had risen by&#xD;
mortal violence to divine mercy.&#xD;
Having completed his rude diagnosis, James fell back with some brief and&#xD;
simple remark, the exact phraseology of which Mrs. Dinneford did notnote at&#xD;
the time, merely gathering that the Judge was quite dead.&#xD;
Now caine the cook, the chambermaid, and lastly Alice. There were four,&#xD;
frightened, weeping, and more or less hysterical women together, supported&#xD;
by only one ignorant, lumpish, and every way inadequate man. Under the&#xD;
spur of necessity Mrs. Dinneford suppressed her own faintings of spirit, and&#xD;
gave such directions as were given. She sent the chambermaid to surnmon&#xD;
the nearest neighbors, and the gardener to search the earth around the house&#xD;
for strange foot-tracks. When the cook proposed to remove the Judge to his&#xD;
bedroom, "and lay him out decently before he stiffened," she called to minda&#xD;
in a vague way that there mnst be legal examinations, and ordered with ex.&#xD;
cited sharpness, "Don't touch him, and don't touch anything.'.?&#xD;
Meantime she was endeavoring to comfort and tranquillize her daughter.&#xD;
Alice was almost irrational with fright and horror; her jaws.quivered so that&#xD;
she could not articulate with distinctness,' yet she talked incessantly. She&#xD;
asked a hundred questions, and asked them over and over again. "Oh,&#xD;
mother, did he breathe? " she chattered. "Oh, didn't he breathe just once?&#xD;
Was he all gone when you came in? Don't you suppose he knew you were&#xD;
there when you touched him? Don't you suppose lie was just a little con-&#xD;
scious? Oh, so sudden! it's worse than the blood, isn't it, mother? Do you&#xD;
think he saw them when they struck him? Do you think he knew they were&#xD;
going to kill him? I hope he .didn't know it and didn't see them-don't you,&#xD;
mother? Oh, I would give worlds if he could have told you something about&#xD;
it., Wasn't it dreadful for him to be alone so! Do you think he was conscious,&#xD;
of it? If he died after they left him, do you think he knew lie was alone? Do&#xD;
tell me something about it. Don't you think anything I"'&#xD;
Terrible mystery of sudden death! The girl was wild to lift its .immov-&#xD;
able curtain, and look upon every feature of the tremendous tragedy within.&#xD;
Death in all its forms, every fashion and incident of death, had an awful fas-&#xD;
cination for her. It was a characteristic of the Wetherel stock, derived per-&#xD;
haps from centuries of serious ancestors who .had felt called to reflect much&#xD;
upon matters beyond the grave, or possibly springing from some still more&#xD;
remote spiritual source of feeling which had swept the breed into puritanism.&#xD;
N~o Wetherel, however light-minded in youth, had ever come to middle age'&#xD;
without gravely pondering the trial of death, andl preparing himself for it by&#xD;
&#xD;
THE.WETHERFL AFFAIR.-73&#xD;
one system of faith or another. And Alice, through her mother, belonged to&#xD;
this-fundamentally earnest-minded race.&#xD;
"'Where is Nestoria? " she presently asked.  "Why doesn't she come&#xD;
here? I will go and tell her."&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford caught her daughter by the hand, and held her fast. For&#xD;
the first time since she'had become aware of the murder she remembered Nes-&#xD;
toria's disappearance; and she feared for Alice's reason, in case some second&#xD;
tragedy should add its horrors to the one before her.&#xD;
"What is the matter?" gibbered the shrinking girl, looking about her with&#xD;
eager eyes. " Did you think you saw them?"&#xD;
" I want you to stay with me,");said the mother. " We will tell Nestoria&#xD;
by and by."&#xD;
Neighbors soon arrived, men and women and children, all of course in a&#xD;
buzz of wonder, curiosity, and horror. They were strangers to the family, for&#xD;
the excellent old Judge had been somewhat patrician in his social ways, and&#xD;
had not sought to consort with the plain farmers and fishermen of the vicinity.&#xD;
But the presence of a mortal tragedy necessarily broke down reserve, and en-&#xD;
abled human sympathy to speak its fitting word and do its helpful deed, so fai&#xD;
is words or deeds could be fitting oi- helpful in such an hour of agitation. . A&#xD;
tlorid, stoutly built man, in a cotton-velvet sack-coat and soiled trigusers of&#xD;
brown linen, who proved to be the keeper of a small amid noisy " hotel " near&#xD;
by, presently made himself prominent in the babbling confusion, assumed a&#xD;
leadership over it, and reduced it to order. His first act of authority was to&#xD;
turn the crowd out of the study and post a sentinel at the door.&#xD;
'Next, turning to Mrs. Dinneford, lie asked, "Is there any property gone?&#xD;
I see the old gentleman's safe is open. You'd better look about and see if&#xD;
anything is missing, and make a note of it."&#xD;
So there was a hasty, flurried examination. No money was found in the&#xD;
safe, although the Judge always kept a few hundred dollars on hand.&#xD;
4 Burglars," remarked the tavern-keeper, whose name, by the way, was&#xD;
Mr. John Sweet. " Looks decidedly burglarish. Anything else gone?"&#xD;
"I can't see his will," murmured Mrs. Dinneford, her hands fluttering&#xD;
over the papers on the blood-stained table, without touching them. "He had&#xD;
two wills here, an old one that was signed, and a new one that he was writing.&#xD;
They are gone, they are both gone."&#xD;
It was a fresh shock, but it would be hard to say whether she were fairly&#xD;
conscious of it or iot, her feelings were in such a turmoil. That a rich legacy&#xD;
might have been lost to her, and that the Wtherel estate might now fall en-&#xD;
tire into the hands of Edward-so much she comprehended in a vague way,&#xD;
without i distinct sense of calamity.&#xD;
" Burglars-yes," repeated the taverner slowly and after sound reflection.&#xD;
" And old uns and bold uns, that's used to takin' risks and knows what risks to&#xD;
take. If I hadn't been a p'lece officer, I wouldn't 'a known what they did&#xD;
that for. The parties concerned 'll have to buy that paper. They'll git let-&#xD;
ters about it. Them fellers pocketed that paper so as to sell it to the heirs.&#xD;
It's a mighty highflown trick, and I shouldn't wonder if it boosted 'em-&#xD;
though law is uncertain, that's a fact. ' And I've known fellers git ofif-I've&#xD;
known-gracious!"&#xD;
.Mrs. Dinneford dimly understood, but made no comments.&#xD;
" Who did the estate go to, by the way ?" was the next question of Mr.&#xD;
Sweet, delivered in an easy, abstracted manner, as if it were of no conse-&#xD;
quence.&#xD;

74                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
In her confusion of mind the good lady promptly stated that the property&#xD;
was to be divided between herself, her daughter, Walter Lehming, and cer-&#xD;
tain benevolent institutions.&#xD;
" And wasn't the nephew to have anything? " asked the taverner, so sur-&#xD;
prised that he showed eagerness. "I seen his nephew t'other day, out on the&#xD;
fishin' grounds," lie immediately added. " That's all. He don't owe me any-&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"No, he was not an heir," sighed Mrs. Dinneford. She was about to add&#xD;
that there had been family troubles, but of a sudden it occurred to her that&#xD;
she was telling more than necessity required, and, still searching with her&#xD;
eyes for the vanished documents, she fell silent.&#xD;
The ancient hunter of criminals made no further remark for perhaps half a&#xD;
minute. He was unquestionably meditating, though lie strove to conceal his&#xD;
thoughtfulness'by looking intently at tie body of the murdered man, his hands&#xD;
meanwhile clasped behind him in a reverent and funeral attitude. After a&#xD;
time there came into his dull and slightly bloodshot brown eye a sparkle which&#xD;
showed that his reflections had culminated in some definite and confident con.&#xD;
delusion; and then he fell to studying Mrs. D iiinneford, searching her face all&#xD;
over with unfaltering attention, and slightly working his mouth at her as if he&#xD;
were trying to mould her' into the sort of person that lie desired. At last,&#xD;
touching her on the arm in a way meant -to be respectful, he observed in a&#xD;
whisper, "I say!"&#xD;
What? " she started, turning sudclenly upon him, with a confused expec-&#xD;
tation that lie was about to point to the murderer.&#xD;
Don't say anything about that, you understand," he continued, almost in-&#xD;
audibly. "I mean about the nephew not having anything. Don't tell any-&#xD;
body but the authorities."&#xD;
With'the consciousness of receiving a terrible inward shock, Mrs. Dinne-&#xD;
ford divined that this man suspected Edward Wetherel of the murder.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
A IIEEOINE VANISHED&#xD;
THE supposition that Edward could have committed this horrible crime&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford instantaneously rejected with all the strength of her kindly na'&#xD;
ture, not seeking to argue upon it in any manner, even to herself, and not re-&#xD;
plying a word to Mr. Sweet, but simply shaking her head in strenuous nega-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Oh, I dare say it was burglars," nodded the ex-policeman, preferring that&#xD;
she should so believe and so persuade others, inasmuch as that would leave the&#xD;
field clearer to his own researches, which, as he trusted, would be gainful in&#xD;
lucre. "I only wanted.to warn you not to say anything that might make&#xD;
trouble for decent folks. Anybody can see what burglars might expect to get&#xD;
out of that paper. Ransom money; that's the idea."&#xD;
At this moment Alice, who had gone up stairs to finish her dressing, came&#xD;
rushing down with a cry of, "Mother, where is Nestoria? She didn't sleep in&#xD;
her rooni."&#xD;
"Girl missing?" eagerly demanded Mr. Sweet. "Servant girl? No!&#xD;
What, not the young ]adyP Well, here's a start."&#xD;
"She was a dear, sweet friend of ours," answered Mrs. Dinneford, hardly&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        75&#xD;
able in her agitation to keep herself from screaming. . "Ican't imagine what&#xD;
has become of her. We must look for her at once."&#xD;
" That's so," was the positive and energetic opinion of Mr. Sweet. "Little&#xD;
golden-haired young lady, ain't it? I'll set a gang a-going right away."&#xD;
He was fully in his element now; here was an opportunity to use his by-&#xD;
gone experience and show his special ability; and he began upon his task with&#xD;
something like the gleeful eagerness of a hound starting out on a hunt; indeed,&#xD;
he might be described as frisking and gambolling, at least in spirit. It was&#xD;
not humanity which made him so alert, for the unsympathetic fact was that he&#xD;
did not care a sixpence about the safety of the missing girl, his sole motive of&#xD;
action being his acquired instinct for pointing and tracking. With harassing&#xD;
and almost abominable cheerfulness he organized a searching party of men&#xD;
and boys, formed it in an extended loose line after the fashion of skirmishers,&#xD;
and caused it to beat through every wood and thicket in the vicinity. Mean-&#xD;
time he himself trotted rapidly along the shore, looking behind every rock and&#xD;
bush and tuft of reeds, examining the sand of the beach for footprints, and&#xD;
scanning the surface of the harbor for floating objects. A careful search of an&#xD;
hour or so only revealed the fact that Nestoria was not in the neighborhood.&#xD;
But Mr. Sweet was not yet at his wit's end. Bouncing into a "sharpy,"&#xD;
he skimmed across the bay to Lighthouse Point, landed near the house where&#xD;
Edward and his friends had lodged, lurked about it until he discovered Mr.&#xD;
Brown alone, and inquired whether young Wetherel wanted to go a-fishing.&#xD;
Mr. Brown, who was a small, knurly, grizzled man of fifty, with wrinkles&#xD;
of chronic discontent about his mouth and nose, replied in an aggrieved, dis-&#xD;
obliging tone, "He don't live here."&#xD;
" Why, yes he does," insisted Sweet. "You've got three boarders, hain't&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
"No, I hain't," was the unsocial, surly answer of Brown, meanwhile sur-&#xD;
veying his visitor 'offensively.&#xD;
" Well, I'll be blowed if you hain't had three," retorted Sweet, with some&#xD;
excitement. "What's the matter? Have they quit without settlin'?"&#xD;
Having aired his temper enough to sweeten it a little, Mr. Brown now&#xD;
gave what information he had to give, tossing it surlily at Sweet over his&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
"Yes, they've quit. I expected 'em to stay a month, and they only stayed&#xD;
a week."&#xD;
"Oh, that's the row, is it?" observed the ex-policeman. "I don't call that&#xD;
handsome."&#xD;
" The foreigner went three days ago, and the others the next day," con-&#xD;
tinued Brown. "Did they owe you anything?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Sweet, which was a fib; but he was anxious to conceal the&#xD;
true motives of his early voyage; and he actually put back to his own side of&#xD;
the harbor without telling Brown the news.&#xD;
On reaching Sea Lodge he drew the chambermaid on one side and whis-&#xD;
pered to her in a confidential, manner, "So the young lady eloped with the rich&#xD;
nephew, did she?"&#xD;
" Deary me!" exclaimed the -amazed woman. " Did she? Well, they&#xD;
was engaged, that's a fact. Well, if that isn't most awful! And his poor un&#xD;
ele dead in the house!"&#xD;
"Yes, shocking coincidence, wasn't it?" mumbled Sweet, and withdrew&#xD;
himself from her to meditate. He saw it all now: the young man and young&#xD;
&#xD;

76                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
woman had run away together; but first one or other of them had stolen. the&#xD;
will and killed the old gentleman.&#xD;
"But what bloody nonsense!" said Mr. Sweet to himself. " They've made&#xD;
the whole thin' as plain as a pikestaff. I don't believe a million can git him&#xD;
off. There'll be a big reward, sure, and I shall have a good chance for it," was&#xD;
his concluding reflection.&#xD;
Having formed his theory of the tragedy, the ex-policeman commenced&#xD;
looking for evidence to support it. The facts were scanty: there was the man-&#xD;
gled body of the victim, and that was pretty much all; so that Mr. Sweet once&#xD;
remarked to himself, "If it wasn't for the corpse, I'd be ready to swear there&#xD;
hadn't been any murder."&#xD;
Not a strange footprint had been discovered around the house, and not an&#xD;
article indicative of the assassin had been left in it. The fatal blow had been&#xD;
dealt with a small hatchet, but this primitive weapon belonged on the prein-&#xD;
ises, and had been 'seen the evening before in the Judge's study, he having,&#xD;
made use of it, in his self-helpful way, to nail Up a bookshelf. The manner in&#xD;
which the assault had been executed was necessarily a matter of loose and va-&#xD;
riable guesswork. Mr. Sweet's prevailing opinion was that the old man had&#xD;
fallen asleep in his chair; that the criminal had crept up behind him and at.&#xD;
tempted to seize money or papers from off the table; that the slumberer had&#xD;
awakened and instinctively seized the intruder, and that then the blow had&#xD;
been delivered.&#xD;
"And no regular hand would 'a hit such a lick-as that," reasoned Mr&#xD;
Sweet. "A regular hand don't draw blood when he can help it. A regular&#xD;
band would 'a choked the old man a little, or stunned him with the hammer&#xD;
end of the hatchet, and taken the money and vanosed. It was a greenhorn&#xD;
that did this job, and it was a greenhorn that the old man knew, so that he had&#xD;
to kill or ne shown up. - Then there's the will gone; that's a note of the first&#xD;
importance; that points, that does. I did think for a minute that -professionals&#xD;
might 'a taken it to bleed the heirs; but, come to consider it, that game would&#xD;
be too almighty risky; professionals wouldn't try it on. The business was&#xD;
done by some man that wanted to destroy the will and keep the old gentleman&#xD;
from making another. And who's the man? The nephew! That's the way I&#xD;
see it."&#xD;
It must be understood that we are- following up Mr. Sweet's cogitations&#xD;
thus closely because he represents the current popular opinion of the moment.&#xD;
While he supposed that he was alone in suspecting Edward Wetherel of the&#xD;
crime, his opinion had already become public property. Nor was the suppo-&#xD;
sition dispelled when the young man appeared at Sea Lodge during the day,,&#xD;
and hurried at once to view the body. Grim eyes watched him with boding&#xD;
curiosity, and noted with a terrible sort of satisfaction that he was singularly&#xD;
pallid and tremulous, and that after one brief, speechless gaze at his mangled&#xD;
relative, he recoiled with a shudder and hastily left the room. The only re-&#xD;
sult of his appearance on the spot was that Mr. Sweet was obliged to abandon&#xD;
one of his suppositions.&#xD;
"Of course he wouldn't quit," argued that gentleman to himself. "I did&#xD;
think for a while that he and the girl might 'a cut off together. But that would&#xD;
'a made things altogether too plin and easy. He hangs around and plays the&#xD;
innocent game. Of course he would. But it won't save him. He shows his&#xD;
guilt in his face, and he's a goner, sure."&#xD;
One incomprehensible circumstance, however, kept Mr. Sweet on the seo-&#xD;
saw of perplexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                          77&#xD;
"Where's the girl? " he repeatedly queried. " That's what gits me. Did&#xD;
she do it? She's from foreign parts, I understand, and probably didn't have&#xD;
much of a bringing' up. Sposin' now the feller got the girl into the job, how&#xD;
would that work? The old man is asleep, and the girl begins to fumble round&#xD;
for the will. and the old man wakes up and grabs her, and she gits scared and&#xD;
hits him. But then what was the use of startin' out to steal the will unless she&#xD;
meant to finish him and stop his akin' another? And would a girl like that&#xD;
be able to screw her courage up to such a bustin' old job? I guess not. It was&#xD;
the feller that did it, I'll bet my pile on it."&#xD;
But Mr. Sweet was destined to go through many changes in, his opinions&#xD;
concerning the tragedy. During the day he learned from indisputable wit-&#xD;
nesses that Edward Wetherel had passed the whole of the previous night in&#xD;
New Haven, keeping up till near morning a farewell "spree" of a boisterous&#xD;
nature with his friend Wolverton.&#xD;
It was the girl that did it," declared the ex-policeman on learning these&#xD;
facts. "She did it, but she did it in the nephew's interest, and verylikely at&#xD;
his request. She did it, and she meant to do'it, and then she cut and run. We&#xD;
never shall git to the bottom of this case till we find that girl."&#xD;
Mr. Sweet, however, had scarcely installed himself comfortably in this con-&#xD;
clusion, when he was ousted from it by a new discovery. He found a certain&#xD;
Tom Higgs, the keeper of a little oyster shop on the New Haven road, who&#xD;
was ready to swear that during the evening of the murder he had seen a man&#xD;
of young Wetherel's. appearance pass his lair in the direction of Sea Lodge.&#xD;
Flatly contradicted as this story was by the New Haven alibi, the ex-police-&#xD;
man could not help hailing it with vague credence, and thus dropped back&#xD;
once More into a suspicion of Edward. In this undecided state we must for'&#xD;
the present leave him, merely adding that the public, mind was quite as much&#xD;
bewildered as his, and that the coroner's jury found a verdict of murder by the&#xD;
'hand of some person unknown, so that the Wetherel tragedy might be said to&#xD;
have already taken on the shape of a mystery.&#xD;
Let us now return to Edward Wethercl. After that brief glance of his at&#xD;
the murdered Judge, he had hastened up stairs to visit Mrs. Dinneford and&#xD;
Alice. They were in a room by themselves; the mother, prostrated by that&#xD;
reaction which follows violent excitement, was in tears; the daughter, her face&#xD;
swollen with crying, was talking garrulously, still putting piteous questions&#xD;
about the death scene. At sight of the grief and agitation of the two wonen&#xD;
the young fellow's nerves gave way, and, throwing himself upon a sofa and&#xD;
hiding his face, he sobbed violently.&#xD;
Isn't it horrible, Edward?" gasped Alice. "6Oh, wasn't it horrible for&#xD;
him to die so!"&#xD;
"Oh, horrible, horrible, horrible!" he repeated in a shuddering tone.&#xD;
His emotion was so violent, and to Mrs. Dinneford its violence was so un-&#xD;
expected, that she looked at him with surprise and alarm. Could it be that&#xD;
the hotel-keeper was right, and that Edward was in some way guilty of his&#xD;
uncle's blood, and that this perturbation was remorse? For a few seconds&#xD;
the frightful suggestion was so mighty that she fought helplessly against it, as&#xD;
a sleeper struggles with a nightmare. But the next utterance of the young fel-&#xD;
low turned her kindly and charitable soul from suspicion to hope.&#xD;
"I seemed to see it all at once," said he. " All at once I saw just what a&#xD;
brute and fool I had been."&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford lifted her eyes to heaven; here was a little comfort amid&#xD;
S'a trouble; perhaps Edward would be better than lie had been.&#xD;

78                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"And poor Nestoria!" Alice babbled on. "Poor little Nestoria! What&#xD;
has become of her? What do you think, Edward?"&#xD;
" Why, what kas become of her ?" demanded the young man, springing to&#xD;
his feet. "Nobody has told me anything. What has happened?"&#xD;
Then came the story of the strange disappearance of the girl, and the fruit&#xD;
less search for her..&#xD;
" [ must go and look for her," said Edward, and hurried out of the room&#xD;
with % facr almost too pale to belong to a living man.&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.            79&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
FRIENDS AND COMFORTERS.&#xD;
SCARCELY had Edward left the Dinnefords when'there arrived two other&#xD;
visitors, the relatives who had been for some time expected as guests-&#xD;
Mr. John Bowider and Mr. Walter Lehming.&#xD;
Mr. Bowlder was a man of headlong demeanor and plunging gait. He en-&#xD;
tered the room crown foremost, and With great vehemence, somewhat as if he&#xD;
were a ram or he-goat who had butted down the door, and was about to inflict&#xD;
the same violence upon the window sash, and go flying into the garden. He&#xD;
was big and heavily moulded, and a loose suit of ready-made clothing made&#xD;
him appear even larger than he was, so that he had the roly-poly look of a fat&#xD;
Newfouqdland puppy. His head was monstrous, or at least it seemed to be&#xD;
monstrous, it was so magnified by a vast shock of hair and a bushy beard, both&#xD;
as white as if he were eighty years old, although he could not have been above&#xD;
fifty. His face was so pink and fresh that it put one in mind of a healthy in-&#xD;
fant; and his large blue eyes had a benevolent, dreamy tenderness which was&#xD;
very beautiful. le made a stamping, jolting rush at the ladies, shook them&#xD;
both at once by the hand with exhilarating energy, and gushed a stream  of&#xD;
friendly incoherence.&#xD;
"I have just seen Edward," he opened abruptly, without any prelude of&#xD;
salutations. "Cheer up about your little friend who has vanished into the un-&#xD;
known. He has found a suggestion of her. Delicate omens traced in air.&#xD;
There is a boat gone, and she must have taken it. Edward is off in search of&#xD;
her. Thought will dissolve the universe and find her at the bottom of it. As&#xD;
for the Judge, dear me, dear me! What.can I say to comfort you?, The red&#xD;
slayer has been here. But then when he thinks he slays he errs. Our noble&#xD;
old friend lives on in the heaven of the good. Well, here is Lehming. Leh-&#xD;
ming, I got in your way, my good fellow. Come forward and speak your di-&#xD;
vine consolations. The voice of the heart is the voice of the gods."&#xD;
Walter Lehming was at least as peculiar in appearance as John Bowlder.&#xD;
In age he might have been twenty-eight, but-he looked nearer forty. He was&#xD;
very short, hardly more than five feet in height, and by many persons would&#xD;
have been called a dwarf. Nor was this insignificant figure well proportioned,&#xD;
:or his brevity of stature lay mainly in his legs, his body being of nearly the&#xD;
natural size. His chest, indeed, was of unusual 'girth, and there was a more&#xD;
than ordinary fulness between the shoulders, so that at first glance he gave&#xD;
one an impression of rickets. As with.most men of inferior height, his head&#xD;
was disproportionately large; and it seemed all the larger because of its lux-&#xD;
uriant covering of straight, matted brown hair. His face was long, marked&#xD;
by prominent cheek-bones and a heavy chin, and of a reddened, sallow com-&#xD;
plexion, not unlike the tint of a Madeira nut. This plain countenance, at first&#xD;
view so unprepossessing and almost repulsive, was' lighted up by a cheerful&#xD;
and amiable expression, which in" the end rendered it agreeable. ' The large&#xD;
gray eyes were patient, meditative, intelligent, and kind; the coarsely modelled&#xD;
mouth had a smile of little less than divine sweetness. When he spoke, more-&#xD;
&#xD;

80                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
over, his low voice at once charmed the ear and touched the soul, so musical&#xD;
was it, so cultured, and so sympathetic.&#xD;
" My dear aunt!" he said, gently taking Mrs. Dinneford's hand and looking&#xD;
her in the face with a composed pity which told of a heart that had learned to&#xD;
be tranquil under sorrows. "I wish that I could have been here to support you&#xD;
under the first burst of this calamity. How much you must have suffered!"&#xD;
Tears sprang into the impulsive, soft-hearted woman's eyes, and bending&#xD;
down toward Lehming, as one bends to a child, she kissed his withered cheek.'&#xD;
It was affecting to see the humble gratitude which lighted up the young man's&#xD;
old face in response to this salutation. Since the death of his mother very few&#xD;
tokens of affection had come his way, and even the embrace of an elderly rel-&#xD;
ative was to him a great and unexpected compliment.&#xD;
We must explain, in passing, that neither of these two men pertained in&#xD;
any manner to the Wetherel stock. John Bowlder was a cousin of the de-&#xD;
ceased Mr. Dinneford, and Walter Lehming was the son of that gentleman's&#xD;
sister, so that he was only a nephew to Mrs. Dinneford by marriage.&#xD;
"And here is Alice," said the shaken woman, fighting with sobs for her&#xD;
voice, but smiling cordially at the same time, so irrepressible was her kindness&#xD;
and cheerfulness. "You must kiss her too, Walter. We must cling together&#xD;
now, like brethren in one-tent. Alice and I will want all the friendship you&#xD;
can give, for our oldest and best friend is'gone from us, and has left us very&#xD;
solitary. It seems to me sometimes as if the angel of mercy stoppeth not to&#xD;
comfort, but passeth by on the other side. - These l ereavements and tragedies&#xD;
do shake one's faith. We have had an awful revelation of the wickedness that&#xD;
can exist in the world. To think that any human being should want to kill&#xD;
our dear, good, beneficent old friend, whose life was one long labor of love for&#xD;
his fellow creatures! He thought so much of you, Walter! He was set upon&#xD;
leaving a portion of his property to you because, he said, you were his rela-&#xD;
tive in the Lord if not in the flesh, and he knew you would be guided to dis-&#xD;
pense it for good. But, oh dear, what am I talking about! I ought not, per-&#xD;
haps, to have told you of that, for crime hbas spread its awful mystery and en-&#xD;
tanglements over this whole matter, and we don't yet rightly know what shall&#xD;
be.. It almost seems as if Providence had taken counsel this time to bring the-&#xD;
plans {of the godly to naught. The will has disappeared,'and of course if it&#xD;
isn't found you will have nothing, Walter."&#xD;
"]Don't speak of it," replied Lehming with perfect composure and the&#xD;
smile of a seraph. "But is the will really gone P" he quickly added, as if a&#xD;
new thought had occurred to him which made the subject important. "And&#xD;
you, then?"&#xD;
"Oh, never mind that row," sighed Mrs. Dinneford. "Alice and I have&#xD;
enough to make us comfortable. We will talk of that by and by, and I shall&#xD;
want your advice about investments at a proper time. I didn't mean to men-&#xD;
tion the will, but my mind does run on so when it gets started, and seeing you&#xD;
quite upset me for a minute. Cousin Wetherel thought so much of you. And&#xD;
now Edward will have the whole of it, and go no one knows whither. But&#xD;
perhaps he will mend, now or later. You know Tupper says, 'Let a spend-&#xD;
thrift grow to be old, he will set his heart on saving.' And if he had nothing&#xD;
he might be tempted to more and greater follies, for poverty shall make a man&#xD;
desperate and hurry him ruthless into crime. I don't mean to prophesy hard -&#xD;
things of Edward, nor to bring him to the bar of my poor judgment. He camue&#xD;
Lo see us just now, and behaved most beautifully."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"It is a pleasure and a duty to hope for the best," said Lehming. " The&#xD;
weight of great responsibility often makes young men suddenly wise. He is&#xD;
intelligent, you know, and good-hearted."&#xD;
"lie has just rushed off after that missing girl in the noblest manner," put&#xD;
in John Bowlder, his great blue eyes twice as large as life with excitement.&#xD;
He I1ent on his mission like a spiritual activity. 1 ought to have borne him&#xD;
company. That girl must be found."&#xD;
" Why ! did you know her? " asked Alice.&#xD;
'Never saw her in my life," declared John Bowlder, "Never heard of&#xD;
her till ten minutes ago. But what does that matter? The divine soul j1&#xD;
promptly receptive to misfortune. Unhappiness always dazzles me. All men&#xD;
and women who are clothed in it take to me a nobler form. Don't understand&#xD;
me as getting on the housetops to boast. But, as Emerson says, why should&#xD;
we make it a point to disparage with our false modesty that man we are? If&#xD;
I am not helpful, I am heartful,"&#xD;
"Cousin John, you run over with Emerson as I do with Tapper," said Mrs&#xD;
Dinneford, laughing out of the midst'of her sorrows, for her humors were won-&#xD;
derfully variable, chasing each other to and fro like kittens.&#xD;
It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to explain that ruddy, headlong John Bowl-&#xD;
der sought to be a philosopher, and that his favorite tap in philosophy was the&#xD;
one commonly called transcendental. He worshipped Emerson, admired Tho-&#xD;
reau, andl read much in Walt Whitman. Years before this, carried away by&#xD;
the story of "Walden," asp many a boy has been by that of "Robinson Cru.&#xD;
soe," lie rushed into the foidsts of Maine, built ,a hermitage there, and com-&#xD;
muned obstinately with unsympathizing nature, until a party of surveyors.&#xD;
found him bedridden with rheumatism and starving, and sent him back to the&#xD;
degrading comforts of civilization.&#xD;
"What is the next thing to be done? " gently inquired the unassuming Leh-&#xD;
ming. '" I am ready to'take all your labors off your hands as far as possible."&#xD;
"The next thing! " groaned Mrs. Dinneford. "It seems as if everything&#xD;
came next. The whole future is such a struggling medley, or at least my poor&#xD;
mind is! But here is a matter that needs counsel immediately. Here is a let-&#xD;
ter to Nestoria; it came this noon, and it must be from her father; just see the&#xD;
foreign postmarks. What shall be done with it? Shall I open it? "&#xD;
" Under the circumstances we are justified in opening it," decided Lehming&#xD;
after brief reflection. "There may be something in it which will indicate&#xD;
whither she would be likely to go, My supposition of course is that she wite&#xD;
nessed the tragedy, and was frightened away by it. This letter may mention&#xD;
friends of hers with whom she might be led to take refuge. Yes, it is our duty&#xD;
to open it."&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford broke the seal, skimmed hastily through the epistle, and&#xD;
uttered a cry of poignant distress.&#xD;
"Her father is dead," she cried. " This is from one of his brother mission-&#xD;
aries. The poor thing hasn't a home in the whole world. Oh, why doesn't&#xD;
she come back to us?"&#xD;
" This is terrible," sighed Lehming, his sallow face beautiful with compas-&#xD;
sion; while John Bowider suddenly thrust his hands into his white beard and&#xD;
did violence to it.w                                      i&#xD;
" We must labor now by day and, night to find her," sobbed  r. Dinne.&#xD;
fohe.&#xD;

this calamity like firemen into. a burning house. But cheer up, my human&#xD;
friends. Labor done with a will is sure to conquer. The will is in itself a&#xD;
guide. As Emerson says, ' A breath of will blows eternally through the uni-&#xD;
verse in the direction of the right and necessary.' . I shall take a boat and go&#xD;
over this whole harbor."&#xD;
" Cousin'John, you may go under it," observed Mrs. Dinneford. " Can you&#xD;
row?"n&#xD;
" I can learn," declared John Bowlder.&#xD;
"But the wind was strong last night, and if she got, into a boat it must have&#xD;
blown her out into the Sound, and the Sound here is twenty miles wide."&#xD;
"I shall remember that," said John Bowlder.&#xD;
And take a boat he did; and upset himself three rods from high-water mark,&#xD;
wading ashore through the shallows with undiminished spirit, but finding him-&#xD;
self obliged to go to bed until his clothes could be dried; for as usual he had&#xD;
lost his valise in his late journeyings, and neither the Judge's garnernts nor&#xD;
Lehming's were big enough for him. Getting tired presently of retirement,&#xD;
he wrapped a coverlet about him and sat by his window, discoursing to the cu-&#xD;
rious idlers who wandered about the grounds, and exhorting them in mystical'&#xD;
proverbial sentences to be helpful.&#xD;
"Your goodness must have some edge to it, else it is none," he lectured to&#xD;
a knot of boys who gathered to stare at him. "Go out and do your bidden&#xD;
work, if you do it alone. Shun father and brother, if your good genius calls&#xD;
you, and they hear it not. But be sure you know how to row before you leap&#xD;
into your shallop. Columbus himself needed a planet to shape his course upon.&#xD;
The brightest of all pole stars in our heaven is experience. At the same time&#xD;
we must not follow the old wife's rule of refusing to go into the water until&#xD;
we can swim. Indeed, courage is the especial duty of youth., The young are&#xD;
apostles. To them the superhuman voice incessantly commands, Go ye forth.&#xD;
I am not speaking now of stealing apples nor of robbing birds' nests, but of&#xD;
conferring benefits and straining the hiher activities. The soul walks with&#xD;
bended neck in cellars, but loftily and usefully above ground."&#xD;
"Benny, come here," yelled one urchin to another, more distant, with&#xD;
whom he was in friendly relations. "Here's a bully old crazy man, an' he's a&#xD;
;oin' it like everything. I guesshe's the murderer. Come an' look at him."&#xD;
Somewhat disconcerted by this misconception, Mr. Bowlder returnee. to his&#xD;
bed until his flannel suit should be dried, leaving the disentanglement of the&#xD;
Wetherel mystery to others, at least for the present.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
THE ACCUSED MAN.&#xD;
EDWARD WETHEREL, an excellent boatman and not liable to do his navi-&#xD;
gation keel uppermost, was no more successful than John Bowlder in discov-&#xD;
ering the missing "sharpy," which, as some surmised, had carried Nestoria&#xD;
away.&#xD;
It was after nightfall when the young mni n returned to. Sea Lodge. He&#xD;
was tired, gloomy, and dispirited, and, although he spent an hour or so with&#xD;
his relatives, he said very little to them and hardly seemed to hear their con-&#xD;
versation. Any one who had studied him under the suspicion that he might&#xD;
be the murderer, would have been puzzldh bled -to find proofs of either innocence&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         83&#xD;
or guilt in his brooding, sorrowful face and absent-minded demeanor. One&#xD;
thing, however, seemed obvious and positive enough; and that was, that he&#xD;
knew 'nothing of the whereabouts or fate of Nestoria. He spoke of her in a&#xD;
tone of perplexity, anxiety, and distress, which could not be simulated.&#xD;
"I must go back to the.city," he said at last. "I propose to engage a tng-&#xD;
boat to take me out on another search at daybreak. When I pa  e will&#xD;
you join me, Lehming? I want some one to keep me company."&#xD;
".I will go with you," promised Lehming, looking gently into the wofu!&#xD;
eyes which were asking this favor of him. 'Blow your steamwhistl eoppo&#xD;
site the house, and I will put out to you in a small boat."&#xD;
So, early the next morning, amid the tender redness of a summer dawn,&#xD;
the two young men set off on their expedition, steaming out into the calm,&#xD;
gleaming expanse of the Sound.     p    osemgutiothca,&#xD;
"I hope you slept last night," said Lehming, 'studying with surprise and&#xD;
pity his companion's pallid face.&#xD;
"I~yent through a few nightmaresn replied Wetherel. "This is a horri-&#xD;
ble; crushing affair. I wonder if I shall come out of it sane."&#xD;
"I see that you are greatly oppressed by it," murmured Lehiming, turning&#xD;
away his eyes from a desperation which pained him, it seem&#xD;
to comfort it. " One thing is certain. Youminusm, it  seed so impossible&#xD;
quickly as possible, and you must obtain sleep       st ayscost."&#xD;
"The tragedy of my uncle's death would alone have shocked me enoust."&#xD;
continued Edward. " We did not agree, and he hadv sc   m   ;  eah&#xD;
rubs out so many things! When I heard of him as murdered, I forgot that&#xD;
we had ever been hostile; no, I remembered it!" he added with a piteous&#xD;
accent of remorse. " I would have given yars of life for one moment in&#xD;
which to make my peace with him. That other world into which men i&#xD;
so suddenly! It takes the color out of this one."&#xD;
"4You are like your family," said Lelmingmeditatively. "All the  -&#xD;
erels whom I have known have been impressionable totespc     o   eth&#xD;
It is a desirable sensibility; it is fruitful of good."c&#xD;
"Do you think so?" asked Edward, in the tone of a man who -udges evil&#xD;
of himself, and has little hope of becoming worthier.  I don'tJ know. I ad-&#xD;
mit the sensibility in my own case. But it only fills me with gloom."&#xD;
"But I was about to tell you something horrible," he wrgesuom .&#xD;
with a great effort. "Do you know that I am accused of t  urdesently,&#xD;
lieve that I never shall smile again, and I don't know why I should live."&#xD;
The cheering smile which Lehnling had struggled to wear hitherto disp-&#xD;
peared; it fell under this tremendous announcement, as a man falls under the&#xD;
blow of an assassin. The compassion which beamed in his large gray eyes&#xD;
was still angelic, but it seemed the pity of a seraph: for a totally lost spirit&#xD;
rather than for one whose sorrow is not without hope.  He must, however,&#xD;
make some answer; and what should it heF A weaker man, overcome by the&#xD;
sight of distress, might have counterfeited ignorance of the frightful suspicion&#xD;
which Edward had mentioned, and denied that itcould be harbored' by any&#xD;
ne But this dwarfish and nisshapen creature was an incarnation of con-&#xD;
science and, intelligence; he had neither the hypocrisy north  olly ona-&#xD;
such a situation as this otherwise than with sincriy nor the folly totrea&#xD;

charitable and disposed to believe the best. Little by little this accusation, or&#xD;
rather this sufspicion, will die."&#xD;
" Do you believe me guilty? " gasped Edward, his face turning ashy, not-&#xD;
withstanding the cheering words to which he had listened.&#xD;
" I do not," answered Lehming solemnly. "This charge had already been&#xD;
made in my hearing. I had considered it, and rejected it."&#xD;
The tall, vigorous young man grasped the hand of the deformed one and&#xD;
clung to it for minutes in silence.&#xD;
" It is time to turn over a new leaf in my book," he said when he had suf&#xD;
ficiently recovered his self-possession to speak. " I have had a commentary&#xD;
on my life which I did not expect. I am face to face with the fact that men&#xD;
consider my character bad enough to justify them in suspecting me of the&#xD;
greatest of crimes. It is time to turn a new leaf, if I know how to turnit."&#xD;
" The knowledge of such things springs from the desire to do them," ob-&#xD;
served Lehming.&#xD;
"You see, I have gained so much by this tragedy!" continued Edward,&#xD;
his mind reverting to the' accusation against him. '"I was to have nothing;&#xD;
and now, if that will is not recovered, I have everything."&#xD;
"I know," gently murmured Lehming, without a tremor of disappoint-&#xD;
ment in his voice. "You are the heir at law. Events have determined that&#xD;
the inheritance shall take its natural course."&#xD;
"You shall see what course the inheritance will take," exclaimed Wetherel&#xD;
excitedly.&#xD;
"Wait! " interposed Lehming promptly, and almost in a tone of command.&#xD;
"You are feverish now. Make no resolutions until you have.recovered your&#xD;
usual health and. mental vigor. Months hence, after the estate has been set-&#xD;
tled, it will be time to -discuss this question. Meantime your first and most&#xD;
pressing duty is to. discover this missing young lady. May I venture to tell&#xD;
you what I think of her case?"&#xD;
" Do you suspect her ?2" demanded Edward, with sudden anger. "Oh, I&#xD;
beg your pardon," he added, in response to Lehniing's gesture of energetic&#xD;
negation. " But that is another of the scoundrelly tales that these gossips are&#xD;
spreading. They say that, because she was betrothed to me, she took the will&#xD;
and struck the blow. It is the wickedest and maddest and most idiotic slander&#xD;
that ever malice and stupidity inv ted. .A crime! She couldn't conceive&#xD;
the thought of a crime. There never was such innocence. Oh,, I must clear&#xD;
her, as well as myself. It must be my life's labor to open up this mystery and .&#xD;
discover the real criminal. I shall have to keep a little of the money for that&#xD;
purpose, Lehming."&#xD;
" You must not talk any more now about the money," said Walter. " Put&#xD;
that matter resolutely py until you have had time for cool reflection. Let us&#xD;
now speak of Miss Berriard. I must tell you frankly that I have my fears for&#xD;
her. I fear that she saw the tragedy; that the horror of the spectacle drove-&#xD;
her half frantic; that she fled from the house and leaped into the missing&#xD;
boat; and that then she was driven out to sea. The sad question is whether&#xD;
accident enabled her to survive the stormy night."&#xD;
Edward made no reply further than to lean upon the bulwark and hide his&#xD;
face in his hands.&#xD;
Except the above conversation, important as showing Wetherel's condi-&#xD;
tion of spirit, nothing worthy of record occurred during this voyage. After&#xD;
zigzagging the Sound in all directions, and making fruitless inquiries at var&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        85&#xD;
ous points of the Long Island shore, the young men returned at evening to re-&#xD;
port their failure to the mourners at Sea Lodge.&#xD;
" What do you think of Edward ?" anxiously inquired Mrs. Dinneford of&#xD;
Jehming, when she found herself alone with him.&#xD;
" I think well of him," he replied. " There has been a wonderful change&#xD;
in his modes of judging and feeling. lie seems as conscientious and unselfish&#xD;
as an angel could demand of a mortal. The only question is whether the im-&#xD;
pression will hold after the stamp is withdrawn; I mean the pressure of this&#xD;
tragedy and this sorrow. Wealth and beauty are great' tempations. I can&#xD;
imagine their power, although I have never been exposed to it."&#xD;
" My poor, good Walter, you haven't had half a chance," replied Mrs. Din-&#xD;
neford,.coloring with compassionate admiration.&#xD;
"I never had but one compliment," he smiled. " When I was a little boy&#xD;
I went to visit my grandmother. The scene is before me now. I sat in one&#xD;
corner of the fireplace, reading 'Robinson Crusoe.' My grandmother, who was&#xD;
talking with another venerable lady, surveyed me now and then over her&#xD;
spectacles. At last the good old creature remarked, in her tremulous, sym-&#xD;
pathetic voice, ' I don't think Walter is quite so humpbacked as he used to be.'&#xD;
That," concluded Lehming, with a cheerful and yet most pathetic humor, "that&#xD;
is the only compliment that I ever had concerning my personal appearance."&#xD;
It was too bad! "laughed Mrs. Dinneford while the tears rushed into her&#xD;
eyes. Then leaning suddenly toward the young man, she laid a motherly,&#xD;
loving hand on his misshapen shoulder, and added, " Walter, you are as hand-&#xD;
some as an angel. You have a beauty that all. tl)e rolling years of 'eternity&#xD;
won't fade. There is your second compliment."&#xD;
'" It is enough to ruin a St. Paul," smiled' Walter, shaking his big head.&#xD;
" Well, let us talk of graver matters, if anything can be graver than I am.&#xD;
It is understood, is it not,' that we acquit Edward of all suspicion of com-&#xD;
plicity in this crime?"&#xD;
"We do-all of us," declared Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
"The world does not," said'Lehming. "And we must support him against&#xD;
the world.,.- No man, oppressed by widespread suspicion and without friends&#xD;
to uphold and cheer him, can easily come to good."&#xD;
"The world is an ill-natured idiot," pronouncedMrs. Dinneford indignantly.&#xD;
"As Tupper says, ' Rashly nor ofttinies truly doth man pass sentence on his&#xD;
brother.' And, in another place, 'Then man's verdict cometh, murderer with&#xD;
forethought malice; and his name is an execration, his guilt is too black for&#xD;
devils; but to the righteous judge seemeth he the suffering victim. Tupper&#xD;
is really wonderful; he is pat to every subject."&#xD;
" Tupper is better than the critics have been willing to adi lt," concedea&#xD;
vho charitable Lehming.    -&#xD;
"But do you think Edward should have all this money?' queried the&#xD;
ady, who, it must be remembered, had a daughter to care for.&#xD;
" The law must take its course."&#xD;
" But do you think he ought to keep it, under the circumstances, knowing&#xD;
his uncle's wishes?"&#xD;
" We can say nothing."&#xD;
." No," sighed' Mrs. Dinneford. " Well, Alice and I are not poor; we can&#xD;
do as we have done. But you-I do wish that you could have something."&#xD;
" As long as there are schools to keep, I trust that I shall nut suffer," said&#xD;
Lehming with his heavenly smile. " Let me revert to my subject,. For Ed-&#xD;

ward's sake, and for the sake of our own dignity and our purity of soul, we&#xD;
must be his firm friends. Is it agreed? "&#xD;
"Yes," affirmed the good lady. "We are all agreed on that point-you&#xD;
and I and John Bowlder and Alice-the whole family. Of this thing Edward&#xD;
is as innocent as.a lamb, and we will bear him our testimony and give him&#xD;
our countenance."&#xD;
But in the world outside of this unselfish and charitable circle opinion was&#xD;
generally less favorable to the young man.- The large rewards which he of-&#xD;
fered for the discovery of the assassin, the uncertain verdict of the coroner's&#xD;
jury, and the complete bewilderment of the officers of justice, were all insuffi-&#xD;
cient to .relieve hin of suspicion. Many persons believed that he personally&#xD;
stole the will and struck the blow; others held that he had incited this miss-&#xD;
ing and mysterious young woman from over sea to commit the double crime;&#xD;
others suspended their decision, as they phrased it, and allowed him, not the&#xD;
benefit, but the injury of the doubt.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
THE TRAGEDY A MYSTERY.&#xD;
LEHMING had a sweet tenacity of. kindliness which would not let him for-&#xD;
get his resolution to stand by Edward Wetherel, nor neglect any opportunity&#xD;
of putting his friendly purposes into practice.&#xD;
"We must have that young man with us," he said to Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
"His excitement is too great to permit him to bear continuous fatigue and&#xD;
watching. All labor is wearing to a man who is unaccustomed to it, and&#xD;
when the motive of labor is anxiety or grief, the candle is lighted at both ends.&#xD;
I know that he does not sleep. After a day spent in searches and inquiries&#xD;
and hopes deferred, he passes the night in struggling with nightmares of mur-&#xD;
ders and kidnappings, or in feverish waiting for the dawn. He will drive&#xD;
himself mad, unless he is stopped on the road by a fever, or unless we take&#xD;
charge of him. The work that he is doing can all be done by others-by the&#xD;
authorities and the police. There is, no need of his attending to it with such&#xD;
wasting and wearing vehemence., I wish you would insist with him upon his&#xD;
joining us."&#xD;
"Certainly!!" answered Mrs. Dinneford with, energy. "Dear me, why&#xD;
didn't I think of it? We can make room foi- him here easily enough; and it's&#xD;
his own house, too, for that matter. What did I let him go back- to the city&#xD;
for, as if he were not one of us? Well, I suppose I know why; and I may as&#xD;
well make my confession. The wretched truth is, Walter, that I did harbor a&#xD;
small wicked doubt about him, though the very idea is monstrous and a temp-&#xD;
tation of Moloch. How fearfully we are given to uncharity and backbiting,&#xD;
even in the secret depths of our souls! And I couldn't help saying to myself,&#xD;
too, that, if he was in the least responsible for the dreadful things that have&#xD;
come to pass among us, he would-be so uncomfortable here, with poor Cousin&#xD;
Wetherel lying (lead and poor little Nestoria gone, and the shadow or their&#xD;
calamity sitting in every room of the house. It is odd and foolish enough to&#xD;
tell, but it was partly pity that moved .me to let him go. I should hate to&#xD;
make Satan himself uncomfortablie, if I was acquainted with him and had to  =~&#xD;
watch his countenance. But Edward is not guilty, and I must get all these&#xD;
temptations of uncharitable doubt out of my heart; and, as you say, we must -&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         87&#xD;
have him with us, and watch over him body and soul. And so, Walter, I do&#xD;
wish you would drive up to New Haven and bring'hiin down to us bag and&#xD;
baggage, as fast as old Sorrel can hobble."&#xD;
Lehming went on his mission of mercy, and performed it with success. Ed-&#xD;
ward joined his relatives, and remained with them during their brief further&#xD;
stay at Sea Lodge, and accompanied them in their mortuary journey to the&#xD;
Judge's final home. The funeral took place in Brooklyn, wherg the old man&#xD;
had resided during rather more than the last half century, and where he had&#xD;
quietly grown, with the rise of landed estate, from modest beginnings to great&#xD;
opulence. We will not describe it further than to say that it was one of those&#xD;
events which interest a city, and that as a spectacle it was notable for solem-&#xD;
nity and multitudes.&#xD;
The family union did not break up immediately, Mrs. Dinneford lived on&#xD;
in the Brooklyn house, and the three men remained for a little time with her,&#xD;
giving what blitheness they could to the bereaved abode. This was not much;&#xD;
they were all more or less haunted and sobered by the tragedy; and it had&#xD;
followed them from Sea Lodge like a ghost, or like the lingering of a fever.&#xD;
If they could have ruled their souls, if they had been persons of hardened&#xD;
sensibilities and lumpish or seared imaginations, they might have laid&#xD;
the matter aside in confidence that it would give them no imminent trou-&#xD;
ble, or none of practical import. The Wetherel Mystery had ,really fallen&#xD;
into blind lethargy, and for some time to come was to have no life but that&#xD;
of spreading in stagnant, inscrutable pools, or rather of creeping in torpid&#xD;
cohcealient like, a river lost under "trembling prairies."  But it was very&#xD;
natural that this fact should not seem possible to the people who were inti-&#xD;
mately connected with the tragedy, and that they should still look from hour&#xD;
to hour to see it emerge in startling fashion from its obscurities.&#xD;
Edward Wetherel especially seemed to be in constant expectation of find-&#xD;
ing some trace either of the murderer or of Nestoria. . He was apparently busy&#xD;
from morning, till night in devising or setting in action some new method of&#xD;
search. He haunted the police offices of Brooklyn and New York, and made&#xD;
several journeys in search of intelligence to New Haven. In view of the pe-&#xD;
culiar responsibility under which lie lay, it was probably well for him that his&#xD;
character drove him into these labors. The horrors of any exceptional and&#xD;
frightful situation, as, for instance, a battle, a shipwreck, or a conflagration, are&#xD;
alleviated by a demand for activity. The troops who may and must charge,&#xD;
or otherwise exert themselves, suffer less in mind than those who are obliged&#xD;
to lie still under fire. This young man was too hard worked to drift into a&#xD;
melancholy, or to hearken to those vices which allure sorrow with a promise&#xD;
of cheer. In the physical fatigues of every day lie found an opiate which, to&#xD;
his own amazement and almost indignation, brought him healthful sleep.&#xD;
"He is able to bear his great'load," said the rejoiced Lehming to Mrs&#xD;
Dinneford. "Not only is he bearing it, but he is drawing strength from it;&#xD;
he is already a greater and better man than he was a month since. In order&#xD;
to do him full justice, we must consider what temptations :he is resisting. A'&#xD;
thoroughly hardened and worldly. spirit would find his situation quite endura-&#xD;
ble, and would settle down under it into an egoistic tranquillity. Suspected&#xD;
men, if they are able and prosperous, easily live down suspicion. All that Ed-&#xD;
ward has to do, in order to win the world's respect and even its admiration,&#xD;
is to keep his uncle's estate, heap it up into millions, and become a powerful&#xD;
capitalist, able to help or hinder others. Hospitality and generosity would&#xD;

88                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
give him popularity 'and surround him with sycophants. There, too, i§ pleas-&#xD;
ure; he might enjoy it to the full, as of old; he might divert himself Nith in-&#xD;
cessant gayeties. But we see nothing in him of either Midas or Sardanapalus.'&#xD;
A new nature has appeared; a new soul has been born. Not a new one,&#xD;
either; it is the grave, earnest soul of the Wetherels; it is the resurrection of&#xD;
his Puritan ancestors. While he had nothing in his life to give him pause, he&#xD;
rushed on in the natural ways of untrammelled youth, too exuberant and fortu-&#xD;
nate for self-control. But a great spiritual paroxysm has brought the founda-&#xD;
tion granite to the surface. The moment he was driven to feel and reflect, he&#xD;
became the traditionary Wetherel. My hope is, yes, and my confident trust&#xD;
also, that his future life will pe one of duty."&#xD;
"I do fervently join with you in that hope and trust," replied Mrs. Dinne-&#xD;
ford. "And I must quote Tupper. Don't you remember that passage about .&#xD;
the, generous heart, lit by unhallowed fire? And then he goes on; 'Yet I&#xD;
waited a little year, and the mercy thou hadst forgotten hath purged that&#xD;
coble spirit, washing it in waters of repentance.' I can't help looking for&#xD;
speech to Tupper. He says just what plain people think, better than they can&#xD;
Say it for themselves."&#xD;
"1We must reckon conscience a constitutional trait," put in oracular John&#xD;
Bowlder, struck by Lehming's ethnological explanation of the change in Ed-&#xD;
ward's character, and continuing the subject with a pleasing sense of origi-&#xD;
nality. " The Germanic 'races, who discovered truth-telling, practise it as no&#xD;
other breed does. I would not be sure that a Wetherel of ancient days, as&#xD;
long ago perhaps as the reign of Odin, did not discover the sense of duty.&#xD;
Edward retains that kind of pulse. He will be a good man."&#xD;
"Cousin Bowlder, you are little better than one of the heathen," smiled&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford. "You might as well trace up godliness to the giants before&#xD;
the flood, and not stop for it in the times of Balder bold, whom Gray tells us'.&#xD;
about; and a very pretty poem it is, too, though not equal to his 'Elegy' by a&#xD;
great deal."!&#xD;
"Nature and grace combine to evolve character," observed Lehming.&#xD;
" They are both forces under the command of the same great Creator of char-&#xD;
acter."&#xD;
" There is another thing which I reverence in Edward," continued the mys-&#xD;
tical Bowlder, too indifferent to orthodox criticism to defend himself against&#xD;
it. "It is his health. He is not one of those who have, cold feet and torpid&#xD;
digestions. He ,can run and think all day. ' I consider myself burly, but he&#xD;
canters me blind. Such a man, a man with sense of duty for a boiler and with&#xD;
driving wheels that never burst, will achieve;results. We shall yet brag of Ed-&#xD;
ward!"&#xD;
In partial correction of these kindly judgments and vaticinations, we must&#xD;
observe that Edward's spiritual spread of wing was not as yet a notably broad&#xD;
one, nor such as promised to indifferent -beholders any wondrous loftiness of&#xD;
flight. To the common eye he was simply a decent, serious, fairly able and&#xD;
hard-working young man. He evidently had a purpose in life; but it was&#xD;
directly and narrowly connected with the event which had roused him out of&#xD;
his epicurean egotism; it was a simple determination 'to clear himself of the&#xD;
suspicion which had fallen upon him, and to find the missing Nestoria. At&#xD;
the same time he exhibited ordinary foresight with regard to the possibilities&#xD;
of his own future. Remembering that the lost will might be recovered, and&#xD;
that in such case he might be obliged, or feel obliged, to support himself, he&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR                          89&#xD;
commenced the study of medicine and prosecuted it with energy. Further-&#xD;
niore, lie labored daily at the complicated task of settling the estate, and thus&#xD;
familiarized himself with the mystery of investments and the details of busi&#xD;
ness. This job, by the way, supported. him; he paid all his expenses, per&#xD;
sonal and extraordinary, out of his administrator's fees; not a dollar of th&#xD;
principal would he as yet apply to his own purposes.&#xD;
This estate, this million which had not been meant for him, weighed upon&#xD;
his mind. As things stood, the whole of it was his; but under the circum-&#xD;
stances he could not allow himself to claim his entire legal right; and there&#xD;
was the perplexing question how the property should be divided. ' As time&#xD;
went on, the matter became urgent, and at last he was driven tQ a decision.&#xD;
One evening he called the family together-Mrs. Dinneford, and Alice, and&#xD;
Lehminig, and John Bowlder-and with some embarrassment opened his&#xD;
burden.&#xD;
"I want to consult you about an affair which concerns four of us very seri-&#xD;
ously," he said. "I wish it concerned you too, Mr. Bowlder. It is this estate.&#xD;
You know of course that I have taken out letters of administration, and that I&#xD;
have been acting under them. I thought it' the best way. I wanted the mat-&#xD;
ter entirely in my own hands, so that I could settle it as might seem to me&#xD;
right."&#xD;
" Has the Judge come to life again ! " thought John Bowlder, while Edward&#xD;
paused to consider his next words. "how the boy-shoulders his responsibility,&#xD;
and stays himselfon his conscience! Business and duty are matters of inher-&#xD;
itance, as much in the blood as certain diseases."&#xD;
 "It has not. been an easy question to handle," resumed the young man.&#xD;
"But I have reached a conclusion. You shall hear. I am not the intended,&#xD;
heir. My conscience will not let me lay hands on this wealth-which the law&#xD;
offers me.' You three-Mrs. Dinneford, Alice, and Lehmhng-you must take&#xD;
it and keep it, at the sole charge of fulfilling the bequests."&#xD;
"Not while I.live, Edward!" shouted John Bowlder, springing to his feet&#xD;
and plunging about the room like a happy rhinoceros./ "I'll murder them all&#xD;
three, if they do. We will have 'no such greediness and griping in this house,&#xD;
so long as I can procure instruments of death. The gods have righted injus-&#xD;
tice. Let it stay righted in the name of the gods. Keep your pelf or give it&#xD;
out of your own hand to the needy or worthy, but don't whimper that it isn't&#xD;
yours and drop it like a scared child. Mrs. Dinneford, what do you say to&#xD;
this ascetic, sitting upon his pillar? He is a man, isnit he, with a heart too bir&#xD;
for his head? What word have you for such a soul as that?"&#xD;
" But it's out of the question, Edward," cried' Mrs. Dinneford, so moved by&#xD;
the young fellow's proffer that she did not hear Bowlder's sentimental uproar,&#xD;
or notice the whimsical generosity with which he refused money that had&#xD;
been offered to other people. "'We can't accept your gift. None of us con-&#xD;
sented 'to that will of Cousin Wetherel's. We "-and she faltered at the foot&#xD;
of a great and difficult steep of heroism-" we claim nothing. It is all yours.&#xD;
Do with it as seemeth to you good."&#xD;
"Certainly," added Walter Lehming, with a composure which was more&#xD;
decisive than any clamor could be.&#xD;
" I expected as much," said Edward, drawing a sigh of relief. " And yet&#xD;
I would have surrendered- all, if you had accepted. 'Well, now I must act.&#xD;
Jon  owd ei' is ghite right in saying that I must give this pelf out of my own&#xD;
-hand, and not wait for others to take it. I shall divide the estate according to&#xD;

the will, with one exception. Mrs. Dinneford and Alice and Lehming will&#xD;
each receive what my uncle allotted to them. If .I do not owe this to you&#xD;
three, I owe it to him. The remainder-that portion which was devised to&#xD;
charities-I shall' keep.  I have my own purposes of justice and benev-&#xD;
olence."&#xD;
"' This is aidistressing subject," observed Lehming. "I answer for myself&#xD;
alone. I refuse."&#xD;
"You will be powerless," said the inexorable Edward. "Your portion&#xD;
will be trusteed to you. Why do you wish to embarrass me?"&#xD;
" Another time," persisted Lehming, rising and walking to the door. "We&#xD;
will discuss this again, when we are calmer. 1 am too much agitated now,&#xD;
and so are you. . But let me tell you that, while I cannot-submit to you, I rev-&#xD;
erence you."&#xD;
"Edward," said Alice. taking her cousin's arm, " I would fall in love with&#xD;
you if you wanted it. What else can a girl do?"&#xD;
Meantime Mrs. Dinneford and John Bowlder had each seized a hand of&#xD;
the young fellow.&#xD;
Tears of gratitude and happiness stood in his eyes; these people, at least,&#xD;
did not believe him a criminal.&#xD;
But we must turn aside from- Edward Wetherel for a little while to see&#xD;
what had been the fate of Nestoria Bernard.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
THE FLIGHT OF NESTOiIA.&#xD;
ON the:night in which Judge Wetherel, with murder stealthily watching&#xD;
hin from outer darkness, sat up to rewrite his will for the benefit of Nestoria&#xD;
Bernard, the girl herself sat up in her own room, unable to sleep.&#xD;
She was thinking of Edward; of the warnings which she had received that&#xD;
he was unworthy of her; of the vague, incomplete, and yet gladdening retrac-&#xD;
tions which had followed on those warnings; of his beauty and graciousness&#xD;
and irresistible tendernesses and lovable lovingness; of the decision which&#xD;
must come to her concerning him from her father; of the undecipherable ob-&#xD;
scurity of life beyond that; then again of Edward, always of Edward.&#xD;
Amid so many meditations, of a character so sweetly or sorrowfully potent&#xD;
for disturbance, how could she sleep, or even prepare herself for sleep? Fur-&#xD;
thermore, there was something in the air of the night, a breath.of miasma per-&#xD;
haps from the marshes that stretched away along the westering coast, which&#xD;
filled her nerves with tremors of unrest. Still dressed, she kept vigil for an&#xD;
hour or two (llow long she could not afterward remember) in a state of mind&#xD;
which she tried to order into thought, but which persisted in remaining revery.&#xD;
All manner of spiritual wanderings, a nomadic host of recollections, plans,&#xD;
hopes, and fancies, came to her in confused succession, pushing one another&#xD;
aside with eager impatience, like the hasty, transitory phantasms of dreams.&#xD;
Things that belonged to the past and things that urgently claimed the future&#xD;
plucked at her for a moment's consideration and vanished. It was one of those&#xD;
hours in which the soul resembles a sea gf little waves, devoid of drift or pow-&#xD;
er, tossing with wearisome monotony and breaking without result.&#xD;
.Of a sudden she perceived that her purse, containing all her little wealth.&#xD;
a hundred dollars or thereabouts, was not in her pocket. Poor as she was.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
and far away from the father who was her only source of supply, this disap-&#xD;
pearance was a matter of rousing importance. Wondering at her own care-&#xD;
lessness, she started up with a beating heart and commenced a search for the&#xD;
lost valuable. It was nowhere in the room; but presently it occurred to her&#xD;
that during the early evening she had bought a cheap little painted basket from&#xD;
a wandering Indian, who had made her think of Sassacus and King Philip;&#xD;
and then she remembered that she' had last seen her treasure in the parlor.&#xD;
She trusted tremblingly that it was there yet, and, lighting a candle, she went&#xD;
down stairs to look for it, treading softly so as not to disturb the slumbering&#xD;
household. Under a cushion of the sofa, just where she had mechanically&#xD;
placed it for temporary safety, she found the purse.&#xD;
With a childlike sense of having escaped a great peril, and with a piteous&#xD;
unconsciousness of the real and horrible jeopardy of life which lurked within&#xD;
a few yards of her,'she joyfully thrust the treasure into the waist of her dress,&#xD;
and turned to leave the room. But the quick movement extinguished her can-&#xD;
die; she was obliged to halt where' she was until her eyes could become ac-&#xD;
customed to the sudden imposition, of darkness; ,and now she made a discovery&#xD;
which only this obscurity could have enabled her ,to make. A single frail&#xD;
beam of light came to her tenderly, like some delicate angel warning her of&#xD;
danger. In her surprise she nearly uttered an exclamation; and had she done&#xD;
so, she might have arrested the step of imminent homicide, as also she might&#xD;
have brought its alarmed violence upon herself. Being a brave girl, with the&#xD;
steady nerves of health, she remained silent, and calmly studied the apparition,&#xD;
discovering almost immediately that it came from the keyhole of the study&#xD;
door. So unfamiliar was she with the thought of crime, that, notwithstanding&#xD;
the lateness of the hour, not a suspicion of murder or burglarycrossed her.&#xD;
She took it for granted that Judge Wetherel had been kept up, by pressure of&#xD;
urgent business; and, saying to herself that she would surprise him with a see.&#xD;
ond "good-night," she glided toward the. study. On reaching the 'door, how-&#xD;
ever, the idea came to her that her venerable friend might not' like to be dis-&#xD;
turbed in his work, and she paused.&#xD;
11er hand was still upon the knob, when she heard within an indistinct ut-&#xD;
tdrance in.a tone which she did not fully recognize; her first instantaneous&#xD;
idea being that it could not be the voice of the Judge, and her next that he was&#xD;
suffering with illness. We may suppose that the sound was the old man's in-&#xD;
stinctive and inarticulate exclamation of surprise and alarm on awakening&#xD;
from his nap in his chair to find an intruder at his elbow. Next, and almost&#xD;
in the sadme breath, came the noise of a scuffle. Frightened at once, and yet&#xD;
eager to know what was passing, Nestoria gently turned the knob, pushed the&#xD;
door ajar, and looked into the room.&#xD;
What she saw was a blow, a gray head sinking under it, and a murderer&#xD;
bending over his victim. In the next instant all was darkness, at least to this&#xD;
horrified spectator. Either the study lamp was at that moment extinguished,&#xD;
or Nestoria temporarily lost the use eve4 of her physical sense,. She believed&#xD;
that she had screamed with all her strength, but the probability is that she did&#xD;
not give forth a sound, for it is certain that no one in the house heard a cry,&#xD;
and that the assassin quietly finished his purloinings. Although the girl could&#xD;
not afterward remember that she had fainted, there must have been) a brief&#xD;
period of unconsciousness, or of stupor approaching to it. We know that un-&#xD;
der overwhelming oppi-ession of fright or horror, conditions of spirit occur&#xD;
-which may fairly be called waking nightmares. Men suddenly attacked by&#xD;

92                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
wild beasts or by Indians have been seen to stand paralyzed, staring at the&#xD;
approaching death without striving to repel it or even uttering an exclama-&#xD;
,ion, as if in a state of catalepsy or bereft of reason.&#xD;
But it was not merely the sight of a shocking crime and the proximity of a&#xD;
mortal peril which had thus stunned Nestoria. 'Dreadful as these things were&#xD;
to innocence and defencelessness, they were surpassed in outrage by a grisly&#xD;
revelation. She had recognized, beyond the possibility.of questioning, the face&#xD;
of the assassin; she had seen it as the countenance of the man who but a mo-&#xD;
ment before had possessed her heart; she had not a doubt that the deathblow&#xD;
had been dealt by the-hand of Edward Wetherel. No wonder that she stood,&#xD;
or it may be lay, beside this tragedy, palsied, speechless, and taking no more&#xD;
part in the scene than if she had been a ghost; no wonder that for a few see-&#xD;
onds, or perhaps for several minutes, she was as powerless as the very spirit&#xD;
of the murdered man, as inaudible and 'unprotesting.&#xD;
But presently an instinct came to life in her. It was a sentiment of shud.&#xD;
dering, of aversion, of recoil. She became aware that she was in darkness,&#xD;
and that through that darkness the murderer was approaching. -It was not&#xD;
fear of death which led her to retreat before him, but a sense that she could&#xD;
not bear to be near him, and that it would kill her to have him speak to her,&#xD;
in her stupefied horror, or, as we might fairly call it, her insanity, she was&#xD;
only conscious of a desire to avoid recognition. This man, whom she bud&#xD;
lately loved, and -whom she- had just seen performing the work of a demon,&#xD;
how could she possibly address a word to him, or hear him call her by name?&#xD;
Dazed, almost senseless, and conscious mainly of loathing, she' retreated me-&#xD;
chanically before the steps which stealthily picked their way through the ob-&#xD;
scurity, as Christiana, if left alone in the Dark Valley, might have shrunk&#xD;
back before the audible oncoming of Apollyon.&#xD;
Presently she -reached a door, and felt that it was open. She opened it&#xD;
wider, passed noiselessly through it, and found herself in the outer air. A few&#xD;
stars glimmered faintly between driving clouds, andl a wild,,sultry wind shook&#xD;
all the ghostly branches of the trees. Of a sudden her physical strength re-&#xD;
turned to her, and she fled. at full speed, without reflecting whither, her only&#xD;
thought being to avoid the fallen angel who haunted her steps, and to escape&#xD;
the task of saying to him, I know you for a devil! With just the intelligence&#xD;
of a scared animal, she followed a path which she had often traversed both by&#xD;
daylight and moonlight, descended a steep slope of the little bluff on which the&#xD;
house stood, and reached the shore. The sombre, indistinct, limitless sea was&#xD;
at her feet; its enormous mystery attracted her as it has attracted many other&#xD;
wretched hearts; it'seemed to her as if it offered a refuge. - On the land she&#xD;
had met shipwreck, and she looked for mercy to the waters. A boat was at&#xD;
hand; she must wade knee-deep in order to reach it; but in another minute&#xD;
she had climbed or fallen into it;. then the moorings were unlashed, and she&#xD;
was adrift.&#xD;
Nestoria had now evaded the awful interview, the fear of which had driven&#xD;
her abroad; and, no longer upheld and impelled by the strength of terror, she.&#xD;
lost her consciousness; this time, there can be no doubt, she really fainted.&#xD;
No pursuer came; no one was at hand either to destroy or save; and in a few&#xD;
minutes the senseless girl was far from shore. The gale, it must be said, did&#xD;
not threaten her 'safety immediately, for it blew off the land, and where she&#xD;
now was raised no sea. The hboat in which she lay was one of those large&#xD;
skiffs which are known' in the neighborhood of New Haven as "sharpies," and&#xD;
&#xD;
THZ WETHEREL AFFAIR.                           93&#xD;
which are. navigated by means of one or two slender triangular sails, and&#xD;
guided either by an oar in the stern or by a rddder. As the "sharpyI"is flat-&#xD;
bottomed, and only draws a few inches of water, it is a fast craft in a light&#xD;
breeze, but risky in a heavy one.&#xD;
Nestoria's boat carried her out into the harbor and toward the menacing&#xD;
expanse of Long Island Sound. It kept head on, for the single mast was set&#xD;
well forward, and the imperfectly lashed sail, blowing out in a bellying pock-&#xD;
et, afforded a sufficient hold to the wind. There was a false, transitory pros-&#xD;
perity in the opening of this strange voyage, as there often is in the outset of&#xD;
flights which seek destruction. With just such fatal smoothness are captives&#xD;
in old poesy borne away by malignant magicians to imprisonment on undis-&#xD;
coverable islands or in the caves of ocean. The home which murder had pol-&#xD;
lute , the darkened room where a dear friend's reverend hair drooped into his&#xD;
own blood, the clandestine face of that flying Cain from whom this unconscious&#xD;
wanderer was escaping, the loved ones who would have sought to succor had&#xD;
they known how.succor was needed, were easily and speedily left behind. The.&#xD;
boat and its burden fluttered out afar from rescue upon a stormy sea.&#xD;
At last there was an awakening. Life, which sometimes seems a monster&#xD;
far'more pitiless than death, dragged the girl back to suffering. At .first she&#xD;
did not know where she was, nor remember what had happened to her. She&#xD;
was aware only of darkness, of solitude and abandonment, of an uneasy and&#xD;
alarming movement, of a sense of utter helplessness. Of a sudden the past&#xD;
struck her like a blow, and for a, few moments she covered her face from it&#xD;
with her hands, unobservant or careless of the frightful present. Then the in-&#xD;
creasing and rapidly recurring roar of the surges, and the jerking, plunging&#xD;
action of the boat as it entered the wilder waters beyond ,the bar, called her to&#xD;
a sense of her strange situation. The storm of shocking recollections in her&#xD;
soul subsided a little as the storm of relentless nature around her became more&#xD;
audible, agitating, and menacing. Still amazed, even in.the midst of her af-&#xD;
fright, she sat up and looked about her.&#xD;
She could see little. The rare and feeble stars, which seemed to swim like&#xD;
wrecked sailors amid billowy clouds, had scant power'of revelation. Around&#xD;
her was tempestuous blackness, stretching away on every hand into infinity.&#xD;
Even the snowy crests of the waves were only visible in a dim, spectral way,&#xD;
and for a brief distance. The boat she could perceive, and the white ghost&#xD;
of the struggli ig sail flying.before her like a lost spirit, a guide ominous of a&#xD;
grave. Holding by the handle of the leaping rudder, which had struck her&#xD;
arm with a sort of spasmodic monition, as if urging her to seize it and exert&#xD;
its spell, she turned and gazed, half-blinded, into the face of the gale. .On her&#xD;
left, but far behind her, she distinguished the red gleam of the lighthouse, now&#xD;
darkening 'and now brightening as if signalling her to return. She knew at&#xD;
last where she was, and comprehended what had- befallen.&#xD;
Inthis uttermost strait of sorrow and peril, flying from a paradise because&#xD;
she had seen it changed into a hell, shrinking from sudden death and yet&#xD;
.scarcely desiring rescue, Nestoria bowed her head to pray.&#xD;
It was the prayer of the shipwrecked, a petition which the remorseless sea&#xD;
has so often mocked, changing it into a shriek of despair. A tumult of fight..&#xD;
ing waves reeled into the boat, and in another moment the girl was struggling&#xD;
for life.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
A SALVATION FROM THE SEA.&#xD;
T HE love of life, that instinct which seems to strengthen just in proportion&#xD;
as invading death cuts intelligence down to the bare root of sensation,&#xD;
enabled and forced Nestoria to hold fast to the wreck of her scallop, and to&#xD;
struggle to keep her head above the waters.&#xD;
Whether dissolution were not more tolerable than existence, whether it&#xD;
would not be well to drop out of a world which had suddenly been changed&#xD;
for her into a place of torment, she did not for an instant consider. Amil&#xD;
tossings, buffetings, whirlings, and suflocaions,. she labored with her whole&#xD;
surviving strength to climb out of the abyss which howled and sucked beneath&#xD;
her, slowly fighting her way to the uncertain asylum of the inverted hulk, and&#xD;
clinging there with a sort of unintelligent tenacity, like a thing of inanimate&#xD;
nature. The slit in the keel for the centre-board offered a hold to her fingers,&#xD;
and by means of this she stayed herself against the pushings of the billows.&#xD;
A long time she remained thus; far longer than she had thought possible.&#xD;
After nature has done all it seemingly can, necessity endows it with force to&#xD;
do more. The power of the dying to resist death exceeds every energy known&#xD;
to ordinary life, and borders closely upon miracle.&#xD;
Presently a light came over the sea; heir first wild impression was that&#xD;
help must be at hand; but it was only the distant, alien rising- of the moon.&#xD;
We can picture her now to our eyesight, as well as to our sensibilities. We&#xD;
have a vision of one who, though beaten and worn and sorrowful and des-&#xD;
perate, was rarely and ono might say shiningly beautiful. Her long golden&#xD;
hair, flung loose by the wind and the waves, blew out in tremulous glistening&#xD;
streatners, like quivering strands torn from the northern lights. Her face was&#xD;
as white as marble, but its delicate finish of fekhture wits all ,the more obvious&#xD;
because of this Pentelican coloring, and its mute resignation was more touch-&#xD;
ing than the agitated despair of the daughters of Niobe. The moon took pity&#xD;
on her, and lighted her up with exceeding tenderness, and showed her forth&#xD;
as an unequalled sacrifice. In all the earth there was not perhaps at that mo-&#xD;
ment another victim of disaster so fair to look upon and so fashioned to.com-&#xD;
mand compassion. Both in beauty and in pathos she may have been for a tine&#xD;
without a rival.&#xD;
Her thoughts meanwhile were on far other things than her own merits and&#xD;
admirableness. Half confounded as she was by the outrages of the sea and by&#xD;
her weakness, she was striving to prepare herself for entrance into that other&#xD;
world which seemed so near; she was groping in the dark gateway of illimit-&#xD;
able mysteries for unearthly hands which should guide her out of all tempests&#xD;
into the great peace of eternal mercy. The past had fallen away from her;&#xD;
even the.calamity which.had driven her out vagrant appeared unsubstantial&#xD;
and long since bygomie; she had almost forgotten that she had lived and loved&#xD;
to her disappointment and her hurt.. The future only was real and urgent to&#xD;
her. Her lips moved, not in reminiscence nor in complaint, -but in petition.&#xD;
" 0 God of our salvation, who art the confidence of them  that are upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         95&#xD;
sea, receive me!" she pleaded, as only the shipwrecked-who are at their last&#xD;
breath are gifted to plead. Other such words thronged mercifully to her;&#xD;
they seemed to lift her like angels, in glorious, shining arms-; they bore her&#xD;
lovingly through the waters which run between two worlds. The faith of&#xD;
her whole innocent life, the faith which had been taught her from infancy by&#xD;
the lips of her father, was now a mighty reality to her, and the only reality.&#xD;
All the rest of existence had become as a vision from which one awakens.&#xD;
But mortality had not yet lost its hold upon this waif of disaster. WA&#xD;
have not ventured an absurdity in describing her as eye-witnesses, for human&#xD;
vision did find her out and human help reached her. In her extremity, just&#xD;
as her numbed fingers were losing their hold, and while the fantastic lights&#xD;
and music and tintinnabulations of the strange city of the drowning were al-&#xD;
ready bewildering her senses, Nestoria became aware of the approach of&#xD;
some dark rolling bulk, out of which presently issued voices and a plashing&#xD;
of oars, all ending in rescue. She was lifted up the side of a vessel, and car-&#xD;
ried into a dimly-lighted cabin, and wrapped closely in blankets, and laid away.&#xD;
Next some stinging and heating liquid, the taste of which struck her as strange&#xD;
and disagreeable, was given her to drink, After that she lay quiet, though&#xD;
with a troublous sense of oscillation among billows, while her mind sank&#xD;
through shoals of reveries which grew more and more like dreams, until pres-&#xD;
ently she was conscious of nothing.&#xD;
It was not the insensibility of a swoon, but of hard, immovable, vice-like&#xD;
sleep. She lay thus for hours, and when she awoke the sun was shining&#xD;
through the. stern windows of the cabin, showing that the horrible night, a&#xD;
night which seemed years in duration, had at last ended. She was still wet,&#xD;
but she had no feeling of chillness, for the blankets and the summer heat&#xD;
made a warmth all about her, and slumber had revived the currents of youth&#xD;
in her veins. Raising herself with difliculty on one elbow, she looked about&#xD;
her with a dreamy, torpid gaze, like that of an awakening infant.&#xD;
A short and squarely built negro, slouchingly clad in garments much too&#xD;
big for him, and exhibiting that lowly and undeveloped physiognomy which&#xD;
almost surely indicates a southern black, rolled out of some unperceived lair&#xD;
and shambled toward her.&#xD;
" How is you, miss?"~he asked with a grin and chuckle which might have&#xD;
been supposed to express unrestrainable hilarity, but which lie simply meant&#xD;
to be reassuring.S-&#xD;
I am well," replied Nestoria, with that languor and vacancy which we&#xD;
sometimes see in persons who have been very ill.&#xD;
" Sorry we could'n keer furyou no better,",-he continued, rolling his eyes&#xD;
around the rudely furnished cabin in an apoloetical way. "Ain't fixed up&#xD;
for ladies. Did'n have no. dry clos' fur you, 'cause the' ain't no women folks&#xD;
aboard. Jes' done you up in them blankets, an' give you a horn o' whiskey,&#xD;
an' sont you to sleep. Done theibes' we could fur you, miss."&#xD;
All this was said with such spasmodic wriggling and luminous grinning as&#xD;
if the peril and escape had been the broadest joke possible.&#xD;
"Iam very much obliged to you," murmured Nestoria.     ,&#xD;
"You's welkim, nriss. Got blown off sio', did'n youP Was the res'.of&#xD;
'em drowned? "&#xD;
'The girl shook her head. She c~uld not enter upon the story of the hideous&#xD;
night. " Where are you taking me to?" she presently inquired, not without&#xD;
a hope that it might be to distant eastern lands.&#xD;
&#xD;

96                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"To New Yawk," said the negro. "We's done got thar now, I guess.&#xD;
Don' ye hear 'em roundin' to? Capm is' gwine ter drop you.in New Yawk,&#xD;
'cause this schooner is boun' souf, to-to some other place-don' know 'zactly&#xD;
whar she's boun."&#xD;
"Can I-pay you for saving meP" Nestoria timidly queried.&#xD;
The man hesitated; he quaked and wriggled from head to foot; in his phys-&#xD;
ical way he was resisting temptation.&#xD;
"4No, I reckon not," he at last responded, chuckling with unusual vehe-&#xD;
mence. "We may want savin' ourselves some stormy night. , You keep your&#xD;
money to git back whar you b'longs."&#xD;
" God reward you!" she whispered; and he reverently answered, " Amen!"&#xD;
By this time the schooner had lain to; and in a few minutes more Nestoria&#xD;
was placed in a small boat and landed on a gray, dingy, deserted dock; hav-&#xD;
ing actually-seen but the steward and three sailors of the somewhat mysterious&#xD;
craft to which she owed her life. One is tempted to suppose a smuggler; and&#xD;
indeed there was a story current about that time of casks of mei'chandise be-&#xD;
ing discovered in the Sound by traders who were singularly prepared for such&#xD;
a speculation in salvage; but, remembering what a moderate and rational&#xD;
tariff we are blessed with, the smuggling hypothesis is obviously untenable.&#xD;
Let us abandon useless suppositions and return to Nestoria.&#xD;
She remained for some minutes upon the dock, not knowing where in the&#xD;
wide world to go. To her the great city which lay beside her was as&#xD;
much a trackless wilderness as her native mountains of Kurdistan would have&#xD;
been to a Neiv Yorker. Upon only one, thing had she come to a resolution,&#xD;
and that was that she would never return to Sea Lodge. .Sitting down 'where&#xD;
the sun could shine upon her still damp clothing, she buried her face in her&#xD;
hands, and pondered long upon her horrible past and perplexing future. It&#xD;
was still very early ; business had not awakened, and the wharves and streets&#xD;
were silent; there was no one at hand to watch or disturb her.&#xD;
Would her situation overwhelm her, or would her character master the&#xD;
situation? The result proved that she had individuality enough to order&#xD;
events, instead of weakly submitting to them. She meditated with that seem-&#xD;
ingly unnatural calmness and that lucidity which fundamentally strong spirits&#xD;
discover in themselves under the pressure of disaster and despair. With an&#xD;
ease which at any other time would have surprised and alarmed her, she dis-&#xD;
posed of some mighty moral questions and decided upon her future course.&#xD;
When she at last rose to her feet and set forward alone into the unfamiliar'&#xD;
mazes of New York, her steps might be uncertain, but not her mind. She had&#xD;
resolved to find a hiding-place, and to remain concealed in it until she could&#xD;
return to her father. She had said to herself that she would not bear witness&#xD;
against Edward Wetherel; that it might be the duty of others so to do, but&#xD;
that it could not be her duty; that she would never tell what she had seen,&#xD;
never, never!&#xD;
She wondered at herself for coming to such a determination, and once or&#xD;
twice the thought struck her that she must be insane, but for all that she did&#xD;
not waver. We will not pause to offer an apology for her which she did not&#xD;
offer for herself, nor enter upon the difficult query as to whether her decision&#xD;
were right or wrong. We propose simply to tell her story as it happened.&#xD;
She could not bear witness against the man whom she had loved; she could&#xD;
not aid in bringing him to death; she could not, and there was an end of it.&#xD;
The resolution was little more than instinctive, or at the highest it sprang from&#xD;
&#xD;
TIHE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
a root  pure emotion, but it was none the less inexorable. For once all her&#xD;
education of conscience, all her innate and acquired sense of duty, fell pros-&#xD;
trate before a sentiment.&#xD;
Her life henceforward was to be a woful and perhaps a criminal problem,&#xD;
She did not think of that, but, drawing her thickgreen-veil over her face&#xD;
walked on in a quiet, business-like way, looking on every side for her desired&#xD;
hiding-place. It is stupefying to ponder upon such single-mindedn ss and sim-&#xD;
plicity. It is niuch as if one were asked in good earnest to watel the adven-&#xD;
tures of Jack the Giant Killer, or some other miute defier of monstrous po-&#xD;
tencies. Here was a child qf nineteen, ignorant of the world in almost every&#xD;
nanner of ignorance, and so topographically uninformed as to be at this very&#xD;
moment'losing her way in Fulton Market, who yet proposed to baffle the New&#xD;
York police, the vast inquisition'of public sentiment, and the Nemesis of ideal&#xD;
justice. . It would not be easy to imagine a greater disproportion in contend-&#xD;
ing forces. One is reminded of a water insect setting out to tread the rush-&#xD;
ings of Niagara. And yet it may be that water insects do skip over the thun-&#xD;
derops cataract in safety.&#xD;
Longbefore the girl found the asylum of which she was in search she be-&#xD;
came languid with fatigue and hunger. She had no desire to eat, but she felt&#xD;
that she must tale some food or drop in the streets, and.it seemed to her that&#xD;
she could sip a dup of coffee. She looked timidly into the doors of various&#xD;
eating shops, but the masculine stares which saluted her drove her onward.&#xD;
Nowhere could she find a refectory frequented by her own sex; it was as if&#xD;
the world had decided that women must not eat in public; as if even in Amer-&#xD;
ica the idea of the harem were dominant. The terrible isolation of the wom-&#xD;
an who has no home attended her feet and oppressed 'her soul. ' Lonely, sad,&#xD;
and geary, she wandered for two hours, slipping on the damp and foul pave-&#xD;
ments, winding- throug-h masses of merchandise which lmee h  ieak&#xD;
and jostled by an ever-increasing crowd of hurrying men. All this time she&#xD;
was endeavoring to get into sonie other quarter of the city. Wherever she&#xD;
was, it appeared to her as if any place would be more friendly and more suit-.&#xD;
able for her purposes than the one in which she happened to be.&#xD;
'At last she came to a great, rambling, sombre, sloppy market, encuin-&#xD;
bered with a monstrous traffic in edibles, and overrunning with purchasers&#xD;
and wayfarers. To her utter dismay she presently discovered that this was&#xD;
the same market which had perplexed her footsteps in the very beginning of&#xD;
her pilgrimage. For two hours she had feebly toiled away from it, and here-&#xD;
she was once more in its undesired medley and uproar. But at least it offered&#xD;
her food; various stalls and shops sent forth an aroma of oysters and coffee; and&#xD;
in some of them there were women satisfying their morning hunger. She.&#xD;
stole into one of these homely lairs, seated herself on a wooden stool with&#xD;
out a back, and leaned her aching head against the grimy wall.&#xD;
A"Stew?" asked a sweaty.attendant in a foul apron and rumpled paper&#xD;
cap.PP&#xD;
Nestoria nodded, and added in a whisper, "Coffee."&#xD;
The food came, and she was making an attempt to eat, when a showy,&#xD;
Well-dressed young woman, bearing in her hand a copy of the " New York&#xD;
Spasmodic," entered with a peculiarly brisk, and Assured air, and seateddler-&#xD;
self at the same table with the salutation, "I am so glad to see you here!"&#xD;
Fancying that she was recognized, Nestoria stared in terror at the intruder&#xD;
ready to spring up and run away.er&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
ROMANCE IN FACE OF REALITY.&#xD;
ONE glance at the young woman who had so abruptly and cheerfully ad-&#xD;
dressed her.convinced Nestoria that she was an entire stranger.&#xD;
-The new arrival was stylish, and even rather boldly showy ; and yet she&#xD;
was not unpleasing in either person or demeanor. She was slightly above the&#xD;
middle height of her sex, and seemed all the taller because she was slender&#xD;
almost to leanness; but she was noticeably easy and willowy in her movements.&#xD;
and, one might concede, graceful. Her dark-red hair was abundant and taste-&#xD;
fully arranged; her tawny-hazel eyes were bright, and her complexion daz-&#xD;
zlingly fair; her features were regular enough, and her teeth were of spark-&#xD;
ling whiteness. Notwithstanding her brusque, confident address, and a cer-&#xD;
tain twinkle of affectation and sentimentality which perked about the corners&#xD;
of her flexible mouth, her appearance was on the whole so much in her favor&#xD;
that it would have been difficult to decide at first glance whether she were or&#xD;
were not a person of good society and of culture. In age she might have been&#xD;
anywhere from twenty to twenty-three.&#xD;
" I never was here before," said Nestoria, after one startled glance at this&#xD;
sociable apparition.&#xD;
"You needn't be ashamed of being here," replied the other with a prompt&#xD;
)tartness,which, slight, as it was, militated against her claims to high breeding.&#xD;
She had noticed the girl's involuntary recoil as if to fly, and had attributed it&#xD;
to mortified vanity at being caught- in a Fulton Market oyster-shop, and had&#xD;
felt offended thereby. "I often take my morning refreshment in this place,"&#xD;
she continued, in a curiously stilted tone which was intended to be dignified and&#xD;
impressive. "The people who eat here are just as nobly-natured as the min-&#xD;
ions of wealth who tread the high-piled velvety carpets of Delmonico's. Pat-&#xD;
rick, bring me a stew and coffee."&#xD;
"I am not ashamed to eat here," replied Nestoria, coloring under a re-&#xD;
proof which seemed to her harshly hostile. Then, feeling keenly that she was&#xD;
hopelessly wretched and doubting whether she were not darkly criminal, she&#xD;
addedin a mournful whisper,- speaking to herself rather than to this stranger,&#xD;
" Any place on earth is good enough for, me."-&#xD;
The other had already opened her copy of ithe "Spasmodic " and settled&#xD;
herself to read the harrowing tale of "Angela's Revenge; " but on hearing&#xD;
this utterance of an undisguisable despair, she looked up in wonder and with&#xD;
an expression of honest though sentimental interest.&#xD;
"And have you seen better days?" she asked in her effected, melodrama-&#xD;
tic monotone, whimsical enough surely, but not devoid of sincerity.&#xD;
Nestoria made no answer, but she thought.of a lost home and a lost love,&#xD;
and the tears brimmed her eyes.&#xD;
"Poo-o-or cheild!" murmured the subscriber to the "Spasmodic."  "has&#xD;
the da-a-ark hand of misfortune been so insupportably heavy on thee?"&#xD;
She mouthed her words like an actress in a fourth-rate theatre. She was&#xD;
little less than ludicrous, and yet she meant to be truly sympathetic, and was -&#xD;
doing her best to console.&#xD;
The homeless one still made no reply; her whole soul was busied in striv-&#xD;
ing to quell her emotion; she was obliged to fight hard to repress sobs-and&#xD;
convulsive twitchings.&#xD;
" Poo-o-or, poo-o-er distressed spirit! " continued the stranger, stretching a .&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
98&#xD;
&#xD;
hand across the table and laying it on a quivering shoulder. "Canst tnou&#xD;
not tell me thy sorrow?'&#xD;
"I have nothing to tell," replied Nestoria, crushing more emotions in one&#xD;
breath than the other had known in her whole life.&#xD;
" Let us swear to respect each other's secrets," exclaimed the sympathizer,&#xD;
with an enthusiasm which was strongly tinctured with romantic joy. "You&#xD;
have a secret of deep and dark misfortune, and you shall not divulge it even&#xD;
to me, nor will I ask it. I also have my burden of woe. But let silence en-&#xD;
fold it. Why don't you eat your stew? "&#xD;
"I will," said Nestoria, and made a resolute' attempt so to do, not from&#xD;
hunger, but to beat off faintness.&#xD;
The stranger meanwhile devoured crackers, oysters, and chopped cabbage&#xD;
with appetite, having no doubt found them by experience to be very support-&#xD;
ing under burdens of woe.&#xD;
"Shall I meet you here again?" she presently inquired.&#xD;
"I don't know," replied Nestoria. " I don't know where I shall live."&#xD;
"No home, no labor, no object in life, no anchor of duty, no star of hope&#xD;
in the future? " sighingly queried the other.&#xD;
,  "I want a home," said the friendless girl, looking up with a glimmer of&#xD;
hope in her piteous eyes. "Can you show me a place where I can live and&#xD;
work by myself? A cheap place ? "&#xD;
"Let us be frank with each other," exclaimed the tawny-eyed one, throw-&#xD;
ing out her hand in a manner which she conceived to be gracefully expressive&#xD;
or noble and generous emotion. "My name is liogen Eleonore Jones. What&#xD;
is yours? "&#xD;
" I wish you would be satisfied with calling me Nettie," answered Nestoria,&#xD;
after hunting through her mind for a false name, and deciding that she could&#xD;
not assume one.&#xD;
"I will," promised Miss Jones with delight. " Then you really, really&#xD;
have a secret! How fascinating and. how pathetic! You shall never lack a&#xD;
friend while I live, and never, never will I ask your family name, nor inter-&#xD;
rogate you of your sorrow. You want to abide and labor alone. What can&#xD;
you do? Can you teach school? Oh, no,. never! Then you would be seen&#xD;
and known: you would be the cynosure of the insolent, prying public eye ;&#xD;
you can't teach."&#xD;
"I can paint fans," suggested Nestoria despairingly, for just then that in-&#xD;
dustry seemed a feeble resource.&#xD;
"Paint fans," repeated Miss Jones. "But can you sell them after you&#xD;
have painted them?" she added with a practical sense which did not seem to&#xD;
be foreign to her real character, notwithstanding her melodramatic tones and&#xD;
phrases. "Well, if you can't, I can, or at least I will. I .will hawk them from&#xD;
mart to mart, and bring you the proceeds of your rmsthetic travail. Come&#xD;
with me, There is a chamber vacant nextto mine. You shall abide in it,&#xD;
and I will beyour lone sentinel. Have you any money?"&#xD;
" I have eighty dollars," replied the confiding Nestoria,&#xD;
"It will last a while," said Miss Jones after a moment of business-like re-&#xD;
flection, during which she cast up some small computation in her head. "And&#xD;
meantime we will beat the airs of fortune with your exquisite painted fans.&#xD;
What are you doing?"&#xD;
" I am going to pay for my breakfast," explained Nestoria, fumbling for&#xD;
her purse.&#xD;

".I thought perhaps you were drawing a poniard," observed Imogen Eleo-&#xD;
nore Jones, with a slight air of disappointment. f I was about to hold your&#xD;
hand, and exhort you to hope on, hope ever. But don't pay. Put up your lit-&#xD;
tle treasure. Let me defray the expenses of this fortunate interview. I have&#xD;
a salary of nine hundred dollars for teaching, and I have five hundred or so&#xD;
in bank, the savings of three long years. I insist upon paying for both."&#xD;
Nestoria submitted; a salary of nine hundred dollars seemed immense to&#xD;
her; if she had possessed it, she would have undertaken to relieve the poor of&#xD;
an entire city.&#xD;
"Now let us buy some fruit," continued Miss Jones, when she had wiped&#xD;
out the two modest accounts. '"This is my matutinal marketing, as well as,&#xD;
my matutinal walk. I come hither to purchase peaches for my noon collation,&#xD;
because they are cheaper here than on the stalls up town. I take a light&#xD;
breakfast; then I take a light lunch of fruit and rolls; then I try every day to&#xD;
afford one good meal, my dinner. One has to economize, you know, on the&#xD;
salary of an instructor," she explained with a courage for which we must&#xD;
honor her, so humiliating is that word " economy " to many people of narrow&#xD;
incomes. "Now don't you buy anything for yourself," she insisted. " I will&#xD;
market for two to-day. All I want is that you should carry your own paper&#xD;
of peaches, like a true, high-minded woman, who is conscious of her own&#xD;
dignity."&#xD;
"I will carry both the parcels," offered Nestoria, putting out her little&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
" No, you shan't carry mine," declared Miss Jones. "And you shan't&#xD;
carry yours either," she added, while the tears of sympathy sprang into her&#xD;
eyes. " You look so pale and weak I won't let you. Have you any bag-&#xD;
gage? "&#xD;
" I have lost everything," replied Nestoria.-               -&#xD;
"Lost everything! And :your dress is damp too!" exclaimed Imogen&#xD;
Elconore. "Why, you are wet clean through!" Then in a really awe-stricken&#xD;
whisper, "Did you try to drown yourself? "&#xD;
Nestoria pressed her veil over her mouth with a shaking hand, and made&#xD;
no reply.&#xD;
"1 wish I could kiss you," whispered Miss Jones, imperfectly suppressing&#xD;
a soh. " I wish all these people were not here staring. I want to kiss you."&#xD;
After wavering to and fro a moment in her willowy way, she suddenly&#xD;
bent forward and placed a kiss on the green barge which covered Nestoria's&#xD;
forehead.  In response a low, suffocated murmur came through the veil,&#xD;
" Thank you."&#xD;
" Now let us go," said Imogen Eleonore, taking her protegee gently by&#xD;
the arm. " We will take the street-cars. I generally walk up, for the exer-&#xD;
cise; but we will ride to-day."&#xD;
By the time they were seated in a car this odd young woman had recov-&#xD;
ered her composure, and with it some of her stilted fashions of thought and&#xD;
utterance.S&#xD;
"Do you know why I thought you were drawing a poniard from your&#xD;
bosom?" she asked in a sepulchral murmur. "See here. I was perusing it&#xD;
as I came down to the market."&#xD;
Unfolding~ber copy of the "Spasmodic," she took out of it another fe'ar-&#xD;
fully and wonderfully illustrated production, a specimen half-sheet of the&#xD;
" Weekly Turtle Dove," and read in her melodramatic fashion the following&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR..                        101&#xD;
elegant extract: "'Allyne Castleton left the room, but returned again to look&#xD;
upon the sleeping object of his dreams, who had been that night so strangely&#xD;
restored to him, when he mourned her as sleeping beneath 1he fragrant roses&#xD;
of a hillside burial-place in sunny Naples. The soft, rich, velvet-piled carpets&#xD;
gave back no sound of his footsteps as he returned to his chamber-door, and&#xD;
lie saw with horror his beautiful cousin Isabel, bending over his loved Angela,&#xD;
draw a gleaming dagger of exquisite workmanship from her bosom and lift&#xD;
her hand as if she would bury it to the hilt in the slumber-soothed bosom.&#xD;
The rest of this story will be found in '- well,:that's all," said Imogen Eleonore.&#xD;
lBut that was the passage which filled my mind when I started so at behold-&#xD;
ing you put your hand into your neck. I expected as much as could be to see&#xD;
you produce a two-edged dagger with a handle of wrought and jewelled&#xD;
ivory."&#xD;
Nestoria's only response to this talk was a slight recoil from the "Weekly&#xD;
Turtle Dove."  The story of an attempt to "murder sleep" brought back to&#xD;
her the horrible tragedy of the previous night. In spite of her efforts at self-&#xD;
oitrol, she trembled as if she were in the chill fit of a fever.&#xD;
Imogen Jones drew a sigh of mingled compassion and satisfaction.- She&#xD;
had not a doubt that her companion carried hid in her bosom a " gleaming&#xD;
dagger of exquisite workmanship," wherewith to cut short surcease of sorrow,&#xD;
should it prove too burdensome. Such wretchedness enchanted her muelo-&#xD;
dramatic imagination, and she actually envied Nestoria the distinction of pos-&#xD;
sessing it.&#xD;
Poo-o-or thing! " she whispered. " Thou art indeed heavy laden. But&#xD;
fear not and fail not. .I will guard thy secret and companion thee. None&#xD;
shall find thee out, nor harm thee. We will walk the ways of life unseen to-&#xD;
gether. But, oh, what a light the works of genius cast ulpon this mystery of&#xD;
existence! Had it not been for my familiarity with the ohefdoeevers of fiction,&#xD;
I should not have been able to at once divine your woes and put forth toward;&#xD;
them the tendrils of my sympathy. I read every story I can find. I have&#xD;
piles and piles of the ' Spasmodic ' and the ' Turtle Dove.' They will help&#xD;
you wfiile away the long, long hours of your mysterious seclusion."&#xD;
After what seemed to Nestoria a prodigious journey through a labyrinth of&#xD;
streets and turnings, Miss Jones imperiously shook her parasol at the con-&#xD;
ductor, and stopped the car.&#xD;
"We are now near my abode," she whispered mysteriously. "Let us&#xD;
alight."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
ANY PORT -N A STORM.&#xD;
TIHE two young women alighted below Canal street, in one of those quiet&#xD;
quarters of the east side of the city which have been forsaken by whiatevei- gran-&#xD;
dleur they once possessed, where dingy and dirty and unlovely tenement houses&#xD;
mingle with sombre and unpleasantly odorous storehouses, where fashionable&#xD;
ladies never go, and suppose that no one else lives.&#xD;
Turning into a narrow street, bordered by sloppy gutters and piles of, gar-&#xD;
bage, and walking for some distance under the mildewing shadow of tall, un-&#xD;
shapely, hard-visaged, discolored edifices, they halted before a plain, dolefully&#xD;
plain doorway, a mere rectangular opening in am ungarnished front of cold&#xD;
gi-ay stone.&#xD;
&#xD;

102                 THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"I have lodgings here," said Miss Imogen, with an air which seemed to&#xD;
explain that it was only a temporary arrangement, and she should soon move&#xD;
into a castle. -"I am sorry, on your account, that they are in the fourth story.&#xD;
But the air and light are so much better up there! Hold on to my arm as hard&#xD;
as you want to."&#xD;
Up they went, clinging to dirty banisters, avoiding the flaky whitewash of&#xD;
neglected walls, and creaking along the bare floors of musty, not to say rancid&#xD;
passages. At last, breathless and tottering, Nestoria was ushered into a small&#xD;
furnished room, the combined parlor and bedchamber of Imogen Eleonore. It&#xD;
was not sumptuous, but it was less comfortless and forbidding than the ap-&#xD;
proach to it had promised, for there was a carpet, a fresh and clean bed, and a&#xD;
small array of other decent chattels.&#xD;
"Now, the first chore is to dry you," said Miss Jones, who was as simple&#xD;
and practical in some moments as she was stilted and .sentimental in others..&#xD;
' You'll have to go to bed till your clothes are dried, for in mine you'd look&#xD;
like a baby in a long gown. You iix yourself the best you can for repose while&#xD;
I light my gas-stove and make a dish of tea for you. I feel as thoughI was&#xD;
ministering to some survivor of a shipwreck. There is a beautiful passage in&#xD;
a story that I want you to read: something about how he lifted in his arms&#xD;
a white, white form, with a beautiful dead face and sweeping yellow hair, drip-&#xD;
ping, dripping ever, with the green seaweed tangled in its golden depths- '&#xD;
Well, I won't tell any more," she added, seeing that Nestoria was stopping her&#xD;
ears. " I mustn't spoil it for you."&#xD;
There was a busy silence of a few minutes, during which the one girl pre-&#xD;
pared her "dish of tea," while the other nestled into her resting-place.&#xD;
"So you have retired, have you?" resumed Imogen Eleonore, turning to&#xD;
survey her guest. "What lovely hair you have-sweeping yellow hair-golden&#xD;
depths!" she went on, staring with admiration at Nestoria's abundant sunny&#xD;
tresses. "Truly the stranger within my gates is worthy of the hospitality of&#xD;
a castle. I wish I could treat you in a castle-like fashion, and wave my hand&#xD;
toward some vast hall full of servitors, and say, What ho, without there! more&#xD;
wine, page! But it must be tea or nothing to-day. Here it is on this little ta-&#xD;
ble, and here's your lunch, and there are the periodicals-the ' Weekly Turtle&#xD;
Dove' and ' Spasmodic '-all the back numbers for six months. I'll he back at&#xD;
three, and then we'll consider about dinner, and lay our plans for the future-&#xD;
You'll have to lock the door after me, and you must only open when I tap&#xD;
three times, twice quickly, and then once. Fear naught; your secret is safe.&#xD;
Adeu and o revore."&#xD;
And with a wave of her hand, which she had caught from a sensational&#xD;
woodcut, the kindly, eccentric Imogen Eleonore departed. She went forth&#xD;
into a world of temptation, and she overcame it. She met people who would&#xD;
have beencharmed to hear the story of her problematic guest, and she told&#xD;
them nothing. The mystery was to her a fountain of exquisite happiness and&#xD;
glory, too precious to be shared with such commonplace souls as all her friends&#xD;
now seemed to her. During the hundrum hours of her school-teaching, she&#xD;
had this nectar served in the most gorgeous halls of her imagination, and held&#xD;
incessant revelry over it. It was refreshment for . the immortals, ennobling&#xD;
and aggrandizing her entire nature, and enabling her to look down upon her&#xD;
fellow "instructors," and even upon the principal. At last she had a mnger&#xD;
in a romance, a real and thrilling and abysmal romance, an adventure which&#xD;
was not one bit like common life, an enigma as sombre and ghostly as any of&#xD;
the gooseflesh marvels of the " Spasmodic "&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR,          .o10&#xD;
The matter gave her much thought as well as much gladness. What could&#xD;
be the spring, the awful motive force, the dark and deep first cause of this&#xD;
mystery? A false lover? A flinty-hearted father?  An unintended crime f&#xD;
Aspirations too great for humanity? This strange, plaintive girl, who had&#xD;
Made her apparition in Fulton Market as damp and as long-haired as a mer-&#xD;
maid, had she escaped from the pirates who, as is well known to readers of&#xD;
weekly literature, haunt the waters of New York bay, or had she simply come&#xD;
forth froil an .unavailing attempt at:suicide? Well, whateve' the precise real-&#xD;
istic bottom of the business might be, it was on the surface a solemn, tremen-&#xD;
dous, fascinating, luxurious mystery. As Imogen Eleonore went about hers&#xD;
aritiluetical and geographical tuitions that morning, she constantly murmured&#xD;
in the recesses of her soul, " Oh, enigma! enigma! "  Keep the secret? Yes, by&#xD;
all that was romantic and sentimental; by all those tender heroines who ha&#xD;
pined away in the pages of the "Turtle Dove," and. those queenly ones wh&#xD;
had died at the feet of the ensanguined columns of the "Spasmodic;" by all&#xD;
the tears and pantings and long-drawn screams that she had read of as "to be&#xD;
continued in our next."  The very extravagances of this fantastic schoolma'am&#xD;
made her one of the securest confidantes and most zealous protectors which all&#xD;
our motley humanity could have furnished for Nestoria.&#xD;
Her educational duties performed, Miss Jones hurried homeward with&#xD;
breathless speed, and found her protege dressed.&#xD;
"I am so relieved!" she gasped. "I had a fearful presentiment that you&#xD;
had flown. Are your garments dry? Well, now, let us discourse the thrilling&#xD;
future. An idea struck me as I wended my way homeward, by which we can&#xD;
save filthy lucre. Instead of taking a room for yourself, why not share mine?"&#xD;
-- Oh, thank you," answered Nestoria. "I could not bear, not yet a while,&#xD;
to live alone."&#xD;
" Poo-r, poor cheild!" murmured Imogen Eleonore. "Solitude and dark-&#xD;
ness would addto tie/horror of thy obscure, unshared. sorrow."&#xD;
"Do not speak of it, I beg of you," implored Nestoria, her face quite pale.&#xD;
"Never, nevermore!" promised Miss Jones in her most exalted manner.&#xD;
"Never again shall that drear topic pass the sealed portal of my lips. The&#xD;
past no more! Henceforward we will live for the future. Well, now about&#xD;
dinner ?'" she continued, relapsing into her earthly tone.&#xD;
Dinner they obtained in a cheap little restaurant, one of many in New York&#xD;
which are unknown to fame, and which deserve to remain so. It was a shop&#xD;
or "saloon " of moderate dimensions, the front crowded with tables and chairs&#xD;
which in diminutiveness and fragility resembled insects, and the rear cut up&#xD;
into narrow alcoves, where the very atmosphere seemed Qleaginous and nour-&#xD;
ishing. On -their arrival they found most of the tables already occupied by&#xD;
people who were evidently of the class which must glance at the cost of a dish&#xD;
before ordering it. There were gentlemen, for instance, who were clerks or&#xD;
mechanics, and ladies who were school-teachers,-or milliners, or otherwise in-&#xD;
dustrial. They 'talked little, as is the time-saving fashion of Americans in&#xD;
feeding, and appeal ed to find their chief social enjoyment in looking at each&#xD;
other in a dumb, unobtrusive way, like so many sheep or other ruminating an-&#xD;
imals at pasture. Through these tranquil revellers, as silent as the'old fellows&#xD;
whom Rip Van Winkle encountered among the Catskills, Miss Jones made her&#xD;
way withl all air of secrecy which was equivalent to wearing an iron mask,&#xD;
pursing her thin lips witil lofty firmness, and glancing neither to right nor left.&#xD;
Nestoria, heCr face hidden by a green veil, and every nerve trembling with fear&#xD;

1O4                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
:f discovery, followed close. They dined in one of the nutritive alcoves, keep.&#xD;
ing the ragged curtains drawn upon the world. The waiter suspected nothing&#xD;
illegal; at least he brought no policeman. The prandial problem was solved&#xD;
for that day, and for many days succeeding.&#xD;
On the way homeward they bought a few fans, colors, and brushes, such as&#xD;
Nestoria needed to commence her small industry; and all the evening she&#xD;
painted, while Imogen Eleonore watched her in admiration, or read tremen-&#xD;
dous serials to her out of the "Spasmodic."&#xD;
" Why, it's beyu-ti-ful!" exclaimed this easily-moved young woman,&#xD;
when a partially finished fan was spread before her, splendid with a bordering&#xD;
of roses and lilies. "What a lovely pattern of gorgeous hues and labyrinthine'&#xD;
verdure! It reminds me of enchanted gardens of delights, too fair--far too fair&#xD;
-for earth. You must teach me how to do this sort of work."&#xD;
"I will show you all I know," said Nestoria.&#xD;
" Not so!" resolutely answered Miss Jones, after a moment of severe re-&#xD;
flection. " I have my own sphere, and I will not intrude upon. yours."&#xD;
It had occurred to her that if she once began to paint fans, her genius&#xD;
would impel her to paint them as no other woman ever did or could,&#xD;
and so she should drive her little guest out of the market. That, of course,&#xD;
she might never, never do; and she must resist the very beginnings of&#xD;
temptation.S&#xD;
"Farewell, art!" she continued, waving her magnanimous right hand.,&#xD;
Farewell the bright sunlights and rich clouds of the aesthetic! Hail, geogra-&#xD;
phy and arithmetic! To your austere mysteries I dedicate my powers."&#xD;
What did Nestoria, what euld the entirely artless, sincere Nestoria&#xD;
think of this whimsical companionP She marvelled at her; she was as much&#xD;
perplexed by Miss Imogen Eleonore as a lamb might be by a monkey or a&#xD;
chicken by a parrot; but, while she found her passing strange, she did not find&#xD;
her ridiculous. It was not in the child's serious and kind nature to discover&#xD;
absurdity in that mysterious medley which she had been taught to call "poor&#xD;
humanity," nor to make of any fellow in the solemn pilgrimage of life an ob-&#xD;
ject of lightminded mirth. Furthermore, she was profoundly grateful to this.&#xD;
good Samaritan in calico who had given her shelter  sympathy; and had&#xD;
she been capable of detecting aught ludicrous in her wa , she would not have&#xD;
laughed at it; she would as soon have made sport of the bald head of Elijah.&#xD;
No such thoughtless or disrespectful young person was she as were those two&#xD;
and forty who were torn by.the bears.&#xD;
The two girls were now fairly launched on a hermit-like existence, such as&#xD;
Nestoria's position demanded. Amid the busy and incurious million of New&#xD;
York they led the life of the proverbial needle in the haymow. , Early every&#xD;
morning they took a long walk in the unfrequented down-town streets, break-&#xD;
fasting in Fulton Market or some similar resort of slender purses, and bring-&#xD;
ing home their modest lunches. Then Imogen went off to "instruct," and&#xD;
Nestoria sat down to her painting. Afterward came a dinner in some roman-&#xD;
tic alcove; then another promenade in the friendly gloom of twilight; then&#xD;
what Miss Jones styled "a soiree of art and literature." It was a monotonous&#xD;
life, but it was mysterious, and, in the schoolma'am's opinion, delightful.&#xD;
There was no danger of disturbance and discovery because of visitors.. Imo-&#xD;
gen Eleonore, like many assiduous readers of ficion, was disposed to seclu-&#xD;
sion; she had not been in the habit, as she frequently said, of mingling with&#xD;
the common herd of mankind; she had found the elevating society of heroes&#xD;
&#xD;
THE. WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         105&#xD;
and heroines abundantly sufficient for her; she had loved to walk alone in the&#xD;
halls of fancy and the enchanted gardens of revery.&#xD;
Fans, a flowery half-dozen of them, were painted in a week or so, and Miss&#xD;
Jones put them under her waterprbof and "hawked them from mart to mart,"&#xD;
as she had valiantly promised. It was new business to her, and she might&#xD;
have scorned it as very low business, only that it was ennobled to her mind by&#xD;
a mystery. Was she not befriending the heroine of some dark and doubtless&#xD;
thrilling tragedy? Uplifted by this thought, she entered a "fancy store" with&#xD;
the air of a duchess in disguise, and fairly cowed the dealer into giving her&#xD;
merchandise a respectful consideration. Still, he did not want to buy; it was&#xD;
a "line of goods," he said, that he had never seen before; nor -did he believe&#xD;
such an article would be called for. But just'then two customers, a dark-eyed&#xD;
and showy young lady of twenty, and a tall, handsome, blonde dandy of nearer&#xD;
thirty, entered the shop. They were talking earnestly, and otherwise had an-&#xD;
air of being interested in each other, so that Imogen Eleonore immediately&#xD;
speculated in her mind as to'whether they were lovers. I believe it may be&#xD;
state(l, by the way, that a woman scarcely ever sees two young people together&#xD;
without trying to forum sone idea as to their heart affairs.&#xD;
" What beautiful fans! " exclaimed the lady. "Oh, Count Poloski, just&#xD;
look at them. ~Are those for sale? "&#xD;
"I was just taking the lot, Miss Dinneford," bowed and smiled the dealer.&#xD;
"Finish your bargain and then let me have one," said Alice, little guessing&#xD;
whose handiwork it was that she coveted.&#xD;
So, the Count and Alice withdrawing a little, the fans were bought at a dol-&#xD;
lar and a half apiece, to be resold at three dollars.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
IN THE DEPTHS.&#xD;
Miss IMOGEN ELEONORE JONES;) rried back joyfully and vaingloriously to&#xD;
Nestoria with the proceeds of her traffic.&#xD;
" Behold the dawn f fortune! " he exclaimed, holding the bank-bills ex-&#xD;
ultingly aloft, and othi'wise making an impressive tableau'of herself, such as&#xD;
one heroine should present in addressing another, especially when the first&#xD;
heroine is the protector of the second.&#xD;
Nestoria counted the money -in amazement, and was thankful and for a&#xD;
nonment happy over it, seeing in her earnings a promise of other prosperities,&#xD;
and, above all, of escape. " Oh, I will work night and day, night and day,"&#xD;
she murmured, meanwhile trying to compute in her excited brain how long it&#xD;
would be before she would have enough to take her to her distant home.&#xD;
" How well you have, done my errand!" was her next thought. " I am 'so&#xD;
(dply obliged to you!&#xD;
4Not so," protested Miss Jones, striving, though in vain, to bear her mer-&#xD;
cantile honors meekly. " It was the beauty of your fans which gave me suc-&#xD;
ces3. A young lady who was in the shop pronounced them exquisite, and&#xD;
purchased one immediately. I think the name of your first patron is worthy&#xD;
of being entered upon the tablets of your memory. It was a Miss Dinneford,&#xD;
and her first name is Alisce, for I heard a gentleman call her so who was with&#xD;
her, and I think he xvas an admirer."&#xD;
A haunting ghost, thie terror of discovery, suddenly slid close up to Nes-&#xD;

106                 THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
toria, followed cy all those other menacing phantoms which belonged in its&#xD;
train. She heard the feet of pursuers, and saw herself haled into halls of justice,&#xD;
and there either denounced. as a bloodstained criminal, or forced to bear deadly&#xD;
evidence against Edward Wetherel.&#xD;
)id you tell her anything about me?," she asked in a faint, eager voice.&#xD;
You do not yet know me," replied Miss Jones, almost offended. "Never&#xD;
for one instant have I forgotten my vow to hide your solemn secret. Some&#xD;
day you will do me justice."&#xD;
"I hope I have not pained you," pleaded Nestoria, fearful of losing her&#xD;
only friend. " I am too much occupied with myself. And yet, if you knew--"&#xD;
She stopped. Her calamity was of such a nature that she could not ask for&#xD;
sympathy under it. She must hide her face from all human beings but one,&#xD;
and from that one she must hide her soul. Oppressed with a sense of utter&#xD;
isolation and abandonment, it seemed to her as if she were an ordained and&#xD;
sealed outcast, a second Cain.  An actual assassin could hardly have felt&#xD;
keener terror and remorse than did this innocent girl who had never even,&#xD;
wished harm to one of her fellow creatures. Of all the ugly features of sin,&#xD;
perhaps the ugliest is this, that it often causes the guiltless to'suffer with the&#xD;
guilty, and sometimes in place of the guilty. Every evil act has its possible&#xD;
rebounds which may strike down those who least deserve punishment.&#xD;
For a few moments it seemed to Nestoria that she could not endure this un-&#xD;
shared torment; and she was nearly driven to making a confidante of her&#xD;
chance inim :ate, and telling the whole story of the Wetherel tragedy. But&#xD;
the thought of exposing Edward, the thought of bringing the man whom she&#xD;
had loved to a shameful death, the thought of being obliged to look upon him&#xD;
while she should utter her dandling testimony-these frightful possibilities&#xD;
struck her dumb. In no manner, neither through confession nor complaint,&#xD;
must she relieve herself ever so little of the burden which had been laid upon&#xD;
her by one who owed her all the happiness in his gift. Under this burden she&#xD;
had tottered a little; but in a minute or so she was steady again; she turned&#xD;
quietly and silently to her painting. It was a prodigious exhibition of tena-&#xD;
city, of magnaniiity, and, perhaps we may venture to add, of heroism. A few&#xD;
days earlier in her life she would not have believed herself possessed of such&#xD;
endurance. 11er character was one of those which ar&amp;amp;"capable of almost in-&#xD;
definite development under adversity, suffering, and combat.&#xD;
It is a proof of her practical ability, as well perhaps as of her ignorance of&#xD;
the great, perplexing world in which she had lost herself, that she had one&#xD;
simple plan of action and never swerved from it. To keep concealed until&#xD;
she could earn money enough to take her back to her father, had been her&#xD;
first purpose, and she conceived no other. . She had the singleness of intent&#xD;
which marks a child, or a dog, or a cat, who, having got into trouble abroad,&#xD;
thinks only of making homeward. There were no wild hopes that some wan-&#xD;
dering fairy of a chance would favor her; there were no dreamings that she&#xD;
would some day find an unexpected friend able and willing to rescue. She&#xD;
had her single, fixed scheme of escape, to be carried out by herself;- and she&#xD;
elun g to it as firmly as in her shipwreck she had clung to the tossing boat.&#xD;
As soon as she had sold a second batch of fans she took a-room by herself.&#xD;
S oney.was indescribably precious, but the chance of thickening her conceal-&#xD;
ment- was more so, and she hind recovered from her first terror of solitude-.&#xD;
-    Indeed, one cogent reason why she wished to live alone was her need of se&#xD;
elusion for meditation and devotion. She had a conflict to maintain, not only&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                          107&#xD;
with fears of discovery and with a sense of outlawry, but also with her sleep&#xD;
less, scrupulous, and hostile. conscience. An unappeasable and menacing&#xD;
voice continually charged her with' guiltiness for hiding the guilty from jus7&#xD;
tice. She had not obeyed her sense of duty, but had hearkened to the plead-&#xD;
ings of her natural heart, a counsellor which she knew to be deceitful and&#xD;
desperately wicked. In this matter she had done evilly from the beginning;&#xD;
and, what was far more dreadful, she persisted in her unrighteousness. That&#xD;
imperious inward voice, a monitor which was the more dreadful because hith-&#xD;
erto she had always striven to obey it, called upon her to repent of her iniquity&#xD;
of silence, and to turn from it.or perish. But such a turning, to be honest and&#xD;
thorough and salvatory, signified nothing less than the denouncing of Edward&#xD;
Wetherel.&#xD;
This was a cross of such exceptional weight, and sharp with such a pro-&#xD;
mise of lifelong wretchedness, that she could not take it up. Scourged by her&#xD;
conscience, she approached it again and again, only to reject it passionately or&#xD;
to seek some way of evading it. Then a new proclamation of guilt resounded,&#xD;
and she heard herself judged as one of the hardened impenitent. All the&#xD;
sources in which she had hitherto found comfortable guidance and hope were&#xD;
now turned into springs of condemnation and threatening. One of her first&#xD;
purchases after reaching her asylum had been a Bible; and hour by hour she&#xD;
turned over its leaves in search of some word which Would justify her in her&#xD;
resolution of secrecy; but she found no text to which she could cling for more&#xD;
than a minute at a time. Shining promises came toward her in garments of&#xD;
peace, but once close at hand changed into accusing angels. She was like a&#xD;
person who.attempts to cross a river on an ice-float, and who must continually&#xD;
leap from one sinking, shivering fragment to another. At one time she sought&#xD;
to uphold herself by persistently repeating that broadest of forgiving utter-&#xD;
anees--that pardon which demands not even repentance for the past, but only&#xD;
reformation for the future: "Neither do I condemn thee; go, and sin no more."&#xD;
But this refuge, like all the others, grew thin, crackled under her feet, and&#xD;
vanished, leaving her in deep waters.&#xD;
The past-that brief, happy past of loving-became as dreadful as the pres-&#xD;
ent, and only less dreadful than the future. It seemed to be shown to her&#xD;
that her calamity was a retribution for giving her heart to a man who had not&#xD;
given his heart to righteousness.  le had been taught to believe in a spec..-&#xD;
providence; to' believe that the Ceator watches over every act of every one&#xD;
of his creatures; to believe that he incessantly chastens the good and punishes&#xD;
the wicked. It was clear enough to her that her ways had been followed up&#xD;
by Omniscience, and that she was suffering a castigation either of mercy or&#xD;
of judgment. Which? How could it be mercy while she continued in her&#xD;
sin? She must altogether give up that unholy affection, and she must repent of&#xD;
having ever indulged in it. Here, as it seemed to her, she found duty somewhat&#xD;
easier, at least for a time. She affirmed that she did not love Edward Wetherel&#xD;
now; that she could not possibly love a man who was a murderer; that the&#xD;
mere thought of such a love filled her with horror. As to the past, too, she pro-&#xD;
fessed repentance, prostrating herself in humiliation because of it, and con-&#xD;
fessing that her chastisement had been merited. For a day or two she had a&#xD;
comforting sense that on this point she had cleared her conscience. But then,&#xD;
like a spectre rising out of a grave, appeared this horrible accusation: " lle-&#xD;
cause you hide this man's guilt and shiel4l him from justice, therefore it must&#xD;
be that you still love him; in some secret and evil recess of your heart there&#xD;
is still an unholy remnant of affection."&#xD;

108                  'HE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"No, no, no! " she protested in agony; and thereupon a pitiless voice an-&#xD;
swered: " Expose him; surrender him to the gallows."  Nothing would an-&#xD;
swer except that she should come out before the world and denounce Edward&#xD;
Wetherel as a murderer. Her conscience demanded it; her innate sense of&#xD;
the claims of human justice demanded it; every near or distant sound of the&#xD;
great city around her seemed to require it;, the ghost of Judge Wetherel arose&#xD;
before her mind and added its grisly urgency.&#xD;
There were times when every passer-by who glanced at the house had in&#xD;
her eyes the air of saying to himself "Here is a place where blood is hidden."&#xD;
There were other times when she saw before her the awfal bar of the Final&#xD;
Judgment, and heard an unearthly voice inquire: " When thou art come&#xD;
hither, wilt thou still be silent?"  There was no end to this beating of remorse-&#xD;
less behests; it was a fiery tempest which never ceased and seldoni lulled.&#xD;
She was almost continually blown up and down gloomy abysses, like the un-&#xD;
resting spirits whom Dante saw in the second circle of the Inferno, among&#xD;
whom was that Francesca who gave all fir -love. If any passage of those&#xD;
Scriptures, to which she vainly looked for comfort, came to her oftener than&#xD;
any other, it was the declaration, 'There is no peace for the wicked."&#xD;
At times it appeared to her that she could not possibly bear' her burden&#xD;
longer unassisted; that, since it would not cot-ie off at the foot of the cross,&#xD;
she must absolutely appeal to human help.~She wrote to her father, not&#xD;
knowing that he was dead, not knowing that this last refuge had been closed&#xD;
to her. She wrote out the whole story of that tragedy which had murdered her&#xD;
venerable friend and her own girlish peace. She filled pages on pages with the&#xD;
hideous narrative, and then readt them to herself as well as she could for weep-,&#xD;
ing. No other eye ever beheld the letter; she could not bring herself to mail&#xD;
it. Nor did she dare keep it long, for the thought came to her that justice.&#xD;
might discover it, and she burnt it to the last shred.&#xD;
Then she wrote another letter saying nothing of her gloomy situation,&#xD;
nothing of her whereabouts. What a struggle it was to chat of comumonplaces&#xD;
when her whole mind was full of calamity and horror! She merely intimated&#xD;
that she did not find America agreeable, and that she might yet be led to ask&#xD;
leave to return home. She added that she was with a friend; and with that&#xD;
vague statement she closed. This wretched epistle she sent, praying to be&#xD;
forgiven for its prevarication-, or rather its suppressions of the truth, but find-&#xD;
ing no justification for them even in necessity, so scrupulous was her sore con-&#xD;
science.&#xD;
. Meantime she. labored without ceasing, for her trouble of mind made her&#xD;
all the more eager to earn money enough to fly with, and furthermore her&#xD;
work was enough of a distraction to be somewhat of a consolation. In the&#xD;
artistic anxiety of touching a rose with its healthfullest flush or a lily with its&#xD;
saintliest purity, she could forget by moments that her soul was sick wit sor-&#xD;
row and stained with sin. Oh, the comfort that innumerable hosts of fearing&#xD;
and mourning ones have found in enforced industry! If the fallen inhabitant&#xD;
of Eden had not been condemned to live by the sweat of his brow, his chastise-&#xD;
ment would not have been diminished, but exaggerated.&#xD;
It was also a blessing to Nestoria, a blessing in the guise of a cruelty, that&#xD;
she was forced to hide her griefs. There is less good in confession, and more&#xD;
good in silent self-control, than is generally supposed. The first is often a&#xD;
weakening habit. atnd the second an invigorating effort. The girl's heart&#xD;
almost burst in her struggle to appear tranquil under the eyes of her fellow&#xD;

lodger; but through this solitary and - painful wrestle she was slowly forming&#xD;
the solid moral fibre which constitutes character.&#xD;
She had been rather more than a fortnight in her seclusion, her hands busy&#xD;
with their graceful industry and her soul with its terrible combats, when an&#xD;
incident occurred which was of far more moment than she could then suspect.&#xD;
Closely veiled, she was returning froip a walk in search of painting materials,&#xD;
when she met in the passage which led to her room a stranger of peculiar ap-&#xD;
pearance, a man of little-more than dwarfish stature, with a reniarkably large&#xD;
head and plain features. Fearful of every one, her first impulse was to avoid&#xD;
him and take refuge in her own apartment.&#xD;
But in this homely face and even in the carriage of this insignificant figure&#xD;
there was an influence which would not let her turn her back curtly. The&#xD;
stranger's expression was one of touching humility and resignation, and also&#xD;
of that benevolence which noble natures evolve out of suffering.' The smile&#xD;
which lighted up the coarse mouth had such a sweetness as one might attrib-&#xD;
ute to the smile of a pitying seraph. With the quick insight of a sensibility&#xD;
which has pondered over calamities, Nestoria divined the man of sorrowVs who&#xD;
has learned to pity the griefs of others. Eager for sympathy and help, she&#xD;
felt an instantaneous impulse to trust this man, and to wish that she knew&#xD;
him. Thus when he took off his hat and approached her, she did not seek to&#xD;
avoid him.&#xD;
I .beg your pardon, miss," he said in a voice as tender and appealing as&#xD;
his smile. "But may I presume to inquire of you as to an old acquaintance&#xD;
of mine ? Does Miss Imogen Jones still live here?"&#xD;
She does," replied Nestoria. "But-she will not be in for some hours. Can&#xD;
I deliver a message to her for you?"&#xD;
"I thank you," bowed the visitor. "Be pleased to say that Mr. Walter&#xD;
Lehiming called on her, and that he proposes to take his old rooms in the&#xD;
building. I regret that I have no card, and must trouble you to remember&#xD;
the name. If you should forget it, you can describe my appearance to her,&#xD;
and she will know who came."&#xD;
This allusion to the oddity, and in plain terms the deformity of his figure&#xD;
was so simple and humble and uncomplaining that it completely captivated&#xD;
Nestoria's sympathy.&#xD;
"I shall not forget the name,'" she said in a tone of respect; and here we&#xD;
must call distinctly to mind the fact that she had never heard it before: for&#xD;
Alice Dinneford had only mentioned Lehming as " Cousin Walter."&#xD;
He bowed his thanks and departed, moving away in .an unobtrusive and&#xD;
and noiseless fashion, such as one may remark in the deformed who are&#xD;
meekly conscious of their deformity.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
PERILOUS ACQUAINTANCES.&#xD;
W HEN Imogen Eleonore returned home and was informed of the visit&#xD;
which had been paid her, her vanity was so much gratified thereby&#xD;
that she made an upright grand piano of herself and executed one of her most&#xD;
thrilling solos.&#xD;
"My soul is rejoiced to hear that he purposes to come here," she discourseL&#xD;
standing up loftily and elocutionizing in a way that was really dreadful.&#xD;
"Walter Lehming is a dwarf in stature, but he is a towering giant im genius,&#xD;
and a sweet cherub in heart. Only he of all tle millions of earth have I&#xD;
found gifted and empowered to soothe the keen blackness of ny soul in its&#xD;
hours of solitary sorrow, and to teach me the sublime lesson of iuproving my&#xD;
mind and elevating my morale by practice in English composition. To him&#xD;
I owe it that days which would otherwise have been dour and drear were&#xD;
transformned'into glowings of beatifie sunshine. To iim, much movie than to my&#xD;
own diffident merits, do I owe my station as an instructor. I rejoice that he&#xD;
is to be of us."&#xD;
" Can I see him sometimesP" asked Nestoria with a timorous and piteous&#xD;
wistfulness. "I thought he seemed very good, and I thought I should like to&#xD;
hear him talk."&#xD;
"Intercourse with him would cheer, entrance, and elevate you,' affirmed&#xD;
Imogen Eleonore, conscious that she herself had acquired eminence of feeling&#xD;
and intellect. " My poor, lonely little Nettie, thou shalt know this noble man,&#xD;
and he shall be thy friend."&#xD;
"Will it be safe?" queried Nestoria, pondering over her terrible secret.&#xD;
Walter Lehning may be trusted," replied the schoohnistress. " If he&#xD;
knew all, 1he would tell naught. The mysteries of angels and demons might&#xD;
be confided to his great heart, and there they would eternally remain, wrapt&#xD;
in pity and silence."&#xD;
From all this grandiose babble, the oddity and absurdity of which she did&#xD;
not very plainly note, Nestoria gathered that it would' be safe fbr her to meet&#xD;
her friend's friend, and that she might find in him a comfortable companion.&#xD;
It was very depressing to be so much alone as she was, and to have no more&#xD;
uplifting converse than that of a " constant reader" of the " Spasmodic."&#xD;
While she did not scorn her fellow-lodger, and had begun to regard her with&#xD;
the affection which in meek spirits springs from, a sense of obligation, she did&#xD;
find her somewhat limited in mind an('vapid in discourse. They two stood to&#xD;
each other in the relation of a superior and an inferior, the former unconscious&#xD;
.of her superiority, and the latter of her inferiority. Thus there was content,&#xD;
but not the highest content; and Nestoria craved betterment, provided it could&#xD;
be had without peril.&#xD;
In a few days Lehming moved ihto the tenement-house, bringing with him&#xD;
the transcendental John Bowider. It must be understood that the Wetherel&#xD;
estate was still far from being settled, and that Lehming had as yet positively&#xD;
refused to receive any advances from it. The Dinneford ladies, oppressed&#xD;
&#xD;
;,&#xD;
x.&#xD;
&#xD;
by the sombreness of the Judge's old house in Brooklyn,. and incessantly&#xD;
haunted there by its associations with their murdered kinsman, had abandoned&#xD;
it and rented a modest dwelling in New York. Bowlder and Lelhming had&#xD;
not accompanied them: it did not seem best to them that two men should&#xD;
abide with two women,. though invited; and thus they had been led to estab-&#xD;
lish themselves in lodgings. They took three rooms on the same floor with&#xD;
Iiogen and Nestoria, thus completing the occupation of the passage. These&#xD;
plain and even mean apartments they fitted up in plain fashion, as became&#xD;
men of small incomes. One was Lehming's bedroom, another was devoted to&#xD;
the transcendental dreanmings of John Bowlder, and the third was a parlor and&#xD;
study.&#xD;
"This door must be always open," said Lehming after he had put the&#xD;
study in order, lined its dingy walls with his coarse book-shelves and strewn&#xD;
the green baize of its centre-table with periodicals. "This must be the read-&#xD;
ing-room of all our fellow-lodgers."&#xD;
You are right, Walter," agreed John Bowlder in his hearty, sonorous&#xD;
way. "There must be no nionopoly of culture. What store of knowledge&#xD;
we have is not ours only, but our friends' also. I think little of books. Man is&#xD;
a god; he is greater than his works; he is worthier of my study. But the&#xD;
written volume ballasts and impels the mind which has not yet learned to&#xD;
steer its own course. Your thought is an inspiration of beneficence."&#xD;
".The room is admirably fitted for the purpose," continued Lehming, ris-&#xD;
ing on the toes of his pygmy shoes and looking about .hini with satisfaction.&#xD;
It could not have been better planned for it. If it opened into my bedroom,&#xD;
it would have an air of privacy, and could hardly be made hospitable. But&#xD;
its only entrance is from the public passage, by which all the world may&#xD;
,come. We will make all the world welcome."&#xD;
"I could wish you would accept of opulence, Walter," said John Bowlder,&#xD;
honestly admiring his deformed friend. "The world would profit by it.&#xD;
Each man has his vocation, and the talent is the call to it. Yours is philan-&#xD;
thropy, as mine is insight."&#xD;
Lehming took no notice of the allusion to the fortune which awaited his&#xD;
beck.&#xD;
"I want the aid of your insight," he smiled. "There are two young ladies&#xD;
on this floor who must, be tamed to enter.this room and use whatever they find in&#xD;
it. I want you to help me bait them with hospitality."&#xD;
" We will call on them and entreat them," declared Bowlder. "We will&#xD;
bring them in hither by the. hand, as you lead, homeless children into your&#xD;
Sunday-school. Let us go to them at once. The man is no man'who waits&#xD;
to do anything, though it be no more than the boiling of an egg, a single min-&#xD;
utle after it can be (lone. The punctual, prompt soul is tihe able soul-what&#xD;
foolish people call the man of talent. But the wise' know him merely as one&#xD;
Who dawdles not,"&#xD;
Then he began to improvise, in a queeor singing way that he had, not spe-&#xD;
cially wonderful for melody, chanting the following wondrous rune:&#xD;
Dawdler, dawdler, dawdle not;&#xD;
Hear the bubbling of thme pot;&#xD;
Stir it while the fire is good;&#xD;
So your mess shall turn to food."&#xD;
John Bowlder had made bales and bales of such verses, which in his mo-.&#xD;
mnents of presumption he tried to hope'were equal to those of Emerson, or at&#xD;

112                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
least conceived in their spirit. Like many men who long to be original, he&#xD;
was instinctively and even to. a certain extent consciously an imitator, and&#xD;
was generally doing his whimsical best to reflect the peculiarities of some ad-&#xD;
mired model, with such fantastic and farcical results as you mpy behold in a&#xD;
"crazy " looking-glass.&#xD;
As his unbroken bass voice gambolled through his "rune," so his clumsy&#xD;
bulk rolled and rumbled along the. passage. Ahead of it glided the little fig-&#xD;
ure of Lehming, like a stunted pony drawing a large wagon. It was very&#xD;
much thus that they went through life: the dwarf guided, while the giant did&#xD;
the bellowing.&#xD;
It must be understood that Miss Jones had so arranged her own room as&#xD;
to be able on a pinch to receive visitors in it. She had divided it into two&#xD;
compartments by means of a lofty though fragile rampart of paper screen,&#xD;
which completely environed her bed and washstand with its gaudy represen-&#xD;
tation of scarlet ships on a blue-vitriol ocean, so that nothing could well be&#xD;
more seemly and genteel at the price. Thus she was in a state of decorous&#xD;
preparation for the two gentlemen, and could admit them without going&#xD;
through any preliminary housewifery. Indeed, she was waiting for then, and&#xD;
opened at the first tap of Lehming's knuckles, so that John Bowlder, who was&#xD;
just about applying his battering-ram of a fist to the door, missed his mark&#xD;
and nearly gave the schoolpa'am a facer, immediately stumbling into the room&#xD;
in his usual headlong fashion. However, he lurched to before he had run&#xD;
down the ships on the paper screen, and was tugged without accident into a&#xD;
proper state of introduction to his hostess.&#xD;
"Miss Jones, this is-Mr. John Bowlder," said Lehming in his simple, well-&#xD;
bred way. "lHe is an old friend of mine, and wishes to be a friend of yours."&#xD;
"I welcome you, Mr. Bowlder, to my humble cot," responded Imogen&#xD;
Eleonore in her most unhuman, grand-piano manner. " In the inane wjlder-&#xD;
ess of brick and mortar which billows and throbs around us there are many,&#xD;
many abodes far more palatial thap this, but none, surely none, in which you&#xD;
would be received with a simpler, more earnest, more heartfelt cordiality."&#xD;
The effect of this speech whs somewhat like that of the opening of the&#xD;
seventh seal; there was a silence of perplexity.and amazement, though not&#xD;
for the space of half an hour. Imogen Eleonore had keyed herself up to such&#xD;
a lofty pitch, and had uttered her greeting in such an unnatural and absolutely&#xD;
untenable tone, that for a moment she could not say a word further, and mere-&#xD;
ly stood panting. John Bowlder, reduced to stark plainness and lucidity by&#xD;
an affectation which overtopped his own, simply mumbled, "Miss Jones, I&#xD;
thank yoi."  He was much in the condition of a rooster who should find him-&#xD;
self outcrowed by a hen. He could not transcendentalize in the presence of&#xD;
such a transcendent young woman. Meekly accepting a hard-bottomed chair,&#xD;
he stared with the utmost circumference of his great blue. eyes at Imogen,&#xD;
postponing 'discourse until he could make up his mind how to take her. Never&#xD;
before, since he becanle a philosopher, had he found so little good in "in-&#xD;
sight."  For a short period it seemed to him as if neither he nor any one else&#xD;
would ever speak.again.'&#xD;
The sensible and kindly little Lehming came to the rescue of these two&#xD;
great spirits, He saw the need of pouring the oil of mediocrity upon the bil-&#xD;
lows of sublimity, and reducing the conversation to a navigable level for hu.-&#xD;
man possibilities. -In his silvery, placid way he remarked, " What a cosy old&#xD;
rocking-chair this is! It reminds me of my grandmother's."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         113&#xD;
But Imogen Eleonore's surging nature was not to be calmed at once., She&#xD;
was laboring under a sense of duty to herself,- and to the sacred rites of hos-&#xD;
pitality. It was necessary to present her young lady friend to the two gentle-&#xD;
men in a manner suitable to the heroine of a mystery. Walking to the door&#xD;
of Nestoria's room with a gait like that of a stage duchess retiring through an&#xD;
upper entrance," she tapped, opened, and said in what she supposed to be a&#xD;
thrilling murmur, " Nettie, my dear, come forth."&#xD;
The answer to this ridiculous.summons was a piteous apparition. After&#xD;
something like a burial, of weeks in duration, Nestoria came 'forth, unveiled&#xD;
and pallid, to meet her fellow mortals. At sight of her Lehming and Bowlder&#xD;
rose to their feet and bowed, with some such feeling as if they were saluting&#xD;
an infant who lidnot belong to this world-an infa nt who had already become&#xD;
a seraph. She was quite small, it will be remembered, and the stress of&#xD;
grinding trouble and anxiety had worn her thin, so that she looked even more&#xD;
tiny and childlike than her wont. Her bright natural color had faded under&#xD;
the shadows of sorrow and confinement; and the terror of discovery which&#xD;
crisped hr heart at this moment gave her a whiteness like marble. In con-&#xD;
trast to this pallor her lucid blue eyes were startling, and her luxuriant golden&#xD;
hair seemed twisted of living sunlight.&#xD;
As for her exp:ession, it was simply wonderful and indescribable. There&#xD;
could not easily be a more touching sadness, a more plaintive demand for&#xD;
sympathy, on the human countenance. In spite of struggles for resignation,&#xD;
in spite of a present effort to put on a mask of unconcern, and perhaps all the&#xD;
more because of the pinching constraint of that effort, she had a look which&#xD;
rivalled the calm despair of the Cenci. * To Lehming and Bowlder, both sen-&#xD;
sitive and sincerely Compassionate spirits, she appeared to advance under a&#xD;
cross and wearing a crown of thorns.&#xD;
Even Miss Jones was impressed by this spectacle of timidity and suffering.&#xD;
For a few seconds she gazed at it in, silence, forgetful of her mouthing elocu-&#xD;
tion and fustian rhetoric, and honestly fearful lest the girl should faint away.&#xD;
But she had a difficult duty to perform: it was nothing less than to present in&#xD;
fitting terms a young lady whose full name she did not know; and, making&#xD;
one of those efforts under which both feelings and circumstances must bend,&#xD;
she addressed herself to the unparalleled ceremony. With a prompt ingenu-&#xD;
ity for which she ever after admired herself, she called to mind the spot where&#xD;
she had' first met her mysterious fellow-lodger, and evolved therefrom a pa-&#xD;
tronym ic for her.&#xD;
"Miss Nettie Fulton,' she bowed in her greatest manner. "Nettie, my&#xD;
dear, let me introduce you to my old friend, Mr. Lehming, and my new friend,&#xD;
Mr. Bo wldler."&#xD;
For an instant she could say no more. The highest triumphs of genius are&#xD;
not gained without an exhaustive struggle. Once more we behold Miss&#xD;
Jones beaten by herself, and reduced to an agreeable silence.&#xD;
There was such a din of shy, timorous blood in Nestoria's ears that she&#xD;
did not notice the new name which had been given her, and so was not dis-&#xD;
composed by it.. She heard only a jumble of words which she knew to be a&#xD;
form of introduction, and in obedience to it she bowed mechanically, but with-&#xD;
out speaking. She was in a strange confusion of spirit. So powvrfully had&#xD;
her~ late seclusion impressed her, that it seemed to .her as if she were now for&#xD;
the first time entering human society. Moreover, there was tme terrible pos-&#xD;
sibility that these men might guess her identity and surrender her to justice.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6242-00000058"/>&#xD;
Nevertheless, she could not help seeking their companionship, as a shipwrecked&#xD;
pirate might draw toward navigators who should land upon his islet, though&#xD;
fearful that they had come for his capture and punishment.&#xD;
Lehiming and Bowlder were also unusually bewildered. They were daz-&#xD;
zled by the girl's beauty, and touched by her plaintive expression of sorrow,&#xD;
and attracted by her air of infantile helplessness. They had a longing to&#xD;
gather her into protecting and comforting arms, as one picks up and pets ant&#xD;
unknown chipd who has fallen into trouble. Thus for a few seconds there&#xD;
was silence, all three gazing at Nestoria.&#xD;
This dumb inspection frightened the girl: of a sudden it seemed to her,&#xD;
that these men had seen her before; and she quivered with a mad impulse to&#xD;
rush back into her room and lock the door.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
FINE TALK AND UGLY 'NEWS.&#xD;
NESTORIA was saved from a flight which might have led Lehming, and even&#xD;
the transcendentally unpractical Bowlder, to suspect something strange in her&#xD;
history.&#xD;
Miss Jones saved her ; not-that she meant salvation; not that she perceived&#xD;
the advent of a crisis which required interference; on the contrary, she was&#xD;
thinking solely of herself, what she must do and how she must appear; her&#xD;
soul, as was too often the case with it, was intent upon her own aggrandize-&#xD;
ment in the eyes of her fellow creatures.&#xD;
" Have the kindness to be seated, Nettie, and you also, gentlemen," she&#xD;
said, waving her hand majestically toward chairs, and talking with her front&#xD;
teeth, as we must do when we wish to inspire respect. "I regret,'fot your&#xD;
sakes, that my accoimodations- are not more palatial. But such as I have&#xD;
that I give, and most freely."_&#xD;
" Monarchs could demand no more," answered John Bowlder, who had by&#xD;
this time recovered from his trance, and saw an opening for philosophy. "A'&#xD;
true monarch, a: natural kingly soul, would desire no more. The angels who&#xD;
visited Abraham found no fault with his tent. Damask curtains and velvet&#xD;
sofas are merely adventitious circumstances, which may or may not attend hos-&#xD;
pitality. We think too lowly of our impulses and too highly of our material&#xD;
surroundings. Man is the oak and wealth the vine; and it is well if the vine'&#xD;
do not strangle the oak; it is well if we cultivate the tree rather than the par-&#xD;
asite. And when I say man, Miss Jones, I mean woman as well."&#xD;
This sort of talk was rather deep water for Inmogen Eleonore. She was at&#xD;
home in the spasmodic tempests of romance, but her first glimpse of the ob-&#xD;
scure ocean of transcendentalism daunted her. Her vanity and pluck, how-&#xD;
ever, rebelled against the idea of being silenced. As the reader may already&#xD;
have suspected, she prided herself on being what-she called a "conversation-&#xD;
ist," and held it a shame to let dumbness prevail in her society. She was al-&#xD;
ways looking for opportunities to shine, and, although her shining was 's the&#xD;
shining of a nipnkey who has daubed himself with molasses, being rather lu-&#xD;
dicrous and inconvenient than illuminating, nevertheless she was not in the&#xD;
least aware of this discouraging fact, and so did her best to scintillate on all oc-&#xD;
cAl11as, how little we understand the opacities of life!" she said with a&#xD;

"How much we are captivated by the palatial brown-stone fronts, nor divine&#xD;
the meanness of the ignoble souls which they shelter, and which perchance are&#xD;
more miserable on Turkish carpets than they would be on sanded floors!"&#xD;
Like many people of small means, who would dearly love to wallow in lux-&#xD;
ury, Miss Jones was much given to imputing unrighteousness to the rich, and&#xD;
t'usting that they have atsbottom a hard time of it.&#xD;
"The finest linen, the soft frills of lace embroidery, and the costliest Majo-&#xD;
lica needlework, are often naught but veils for vice and misery," she went-on&#xD;
cheerfully and magnanimously. "As you observe, Mr. Bowlder, we must not&#xD;

" Don t let us be too hard on the rich," smiled thle kindly pygmy "The&#xD;

now, ought we to blame people for their surrioundiing's? Let us judge the me&#xD;

ing s, and even to grant them some admiration."&#xD;
"bCertainly," bowed imogen Eleonore, disposed to assent to these opinions&#xD;
because they had been imputed to her.&#xD;
And now let us make a little journey," continued Lehming, rising. "I&#xD;
want to show you sometling which I think will give you a pleasure. Miss&#xD;
adrttie," he dded, turning; to Nestoria, and addressing her as le would have&#xD;
addressed a child, so youthful was her appearance-" Miss Nettie, will you&#xD;
walk with nie? You and I are so nearly of a size that we shall not overshad-&#xD;
each other.Wwil-let-those-two loftier people follow us. The brownies&#xD;
and fairies preceded the human beings in the procession of existence. Poor&#xD;
little extinct fairies and brownies! You and I are almost the last of those&#xD;
races."tos&#xD;
sThey marched two and two through the passage to the door of Lehming's&#xD;
study.&#xD;
"Enter my palace," he said. " This is my hall of glamour and enchant-&#xD;
ment. here are treasures of gladness, my dear Miss Jones, whicb brown-&#xD;
stone palaces cannot surpass. This is our common reading-room, and the&#xD;
reading-room of all in this house. You two ladies must come here whenever&#xD;
you wish, and carry away whatever you like. A daily paper and two literary&#xD;
weeklies and half a dozen magazines and four hundred books will keep us all&#xD;
in luxury."&#xD;
Oh,  1 am so grateful to you, sir!" exclaimed Nestoria. Her pale cheeks&#xD;
flushed with pleasure, and the flushin caused a sudden, surprising increase in&#xD;
her beauty, not unlike what we see in the light of certain stars, which one mo-&#xD;
ment are dim and the next luminous.&#xD;
"You are fond of reading," said Lehming, delighted with her satisfaction.&#xD;
"Very," replied the girl, her eyes wandering greedily along the book-&#xD;
seves.&#xD;
"You surprise me, Nettie," observed Miss Jones, "You hardly ever look&#xD;
at the Stacks and stacks of literature in my room."&#xD;
"Te 'Spasmodic ' and the ' Turtle Dove!' " smiled Lehming. "I decline&#xD;

&#xD;
to blame her. My dear Miss Jones, there are better things than the ' Spas-&#xD;
modic ' and the 'Turtle Dove,' and it is time that we give our attention to&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"I thought you approved of fiction," stammered Imogen Eleonore, a sensi&#xD;
tive plant by reason of much vanity, and disposed to accept exhortation as re-&#xD;
proof.&#xD;
'-Here are Dickens and Hawthorne and Trollope and Charles Reade," con-&#xD;
tinued Lehming. "They tell better stories than you will find in our New&#xD;
York weeklies."&#xD;
" I have read 'Foul Play,'" said Miss Jones, glancing at the title of that&#xD;
work. "It was in a ten-cent pamphlet, the same as a 'lDime Novel.' That is&#xD;
by Charles Reade, I see. Did he ever write anything else?"&#xD;
Even Lehming, accustomed as he was to the humbler society of New York,&#xD;
marvelled at such amazing ignorance in a veteran devourer of romance. Here&#xD;
was a young woman wvho read almost nothing but novels, and who yet scarce-&#xD;
ly knew the name of Charles Reade, while IIawthorne and Trollope were evi-&#xD;
(lently as strange to her as Berosus and Sanchoniathon. To a person of re-&#xD;
fined taste the lack of literary culture among the great mass, the overwhelm-&#xD;
ing majority, of the so-called reading public is all but incredible. The million,&#xD;
or perhaps one might truthfully say the millions, who find their sentimental&#xD;
recreation in such papers a  the'sanguinary "spasmodic" or the amatory&#xD;
Turtle Dove," are as unaware of the real masters of dramatic and literary&#xD;
prt as they are of the celebrities of metaphysics or philology. They do not&#xD;
now their works at all, and if they knew them they would not like them.. A&#xD;
sensational weekly which should attempt to entertain its subscribers with the&#xD;
hovels of Ilawthorne or George Eliot, would probably come to an early de-&#xD;
cease. The true secret of gaining the favor of this immensely numerous class&#xD;
of readers is to furnish theni with, matter just a little better than they could&#xD;
Write themselves.&#xD;
You may trust Reade," said Lehming, who was anxious to raise Miss&#xD;
Jones's standard of taste. ;  lHe will always give you a well-ordered plot and an&#xD;
interesting sequence of incidents. Some of his characters, too, aire sketched&#xD;
vigorously, and have the broad traits of human nature recognizable every-&#xD;
where. 1 should think a Chinaman might be interested in Reade. Try him&#xD;
by all means ; then we will go higher."&#xD;
Imogen Eleonore, meanwhile, was reconnoitring the pages of " Griffith&#xD;
Gaunt" with a questioning and skittish eye, ready td start back if she should&#xD;
discover anything grave or tedious..&#xD;
"Here is what seems to speak to my soul," she at last said, though with&#xD;
some hesitation, as though the speech were indistinct or the soul.hard of hear-&#xD;
ing. "There is a tremulous strain of woe in this tale which I think will suit&#xD;
me, she added, putting the book under her arm, and turning to the more al-&#xD;
luring matter of a pictorial weekly.,&#xD;
Meantime Nestoria had taken a small, plain volume from the shelves, and&#xD;
had plunged her face into it with the eager air of one violently athirst, who sa-&#xD;
tiates himself from a fountain.&#xD;
"May I ask what you have there, Miss Nettie?" inquired Lehming, ap-&#xD;
* - roaching her in his'gentle, gliding, nurselike way.   -&#xD;
She held up that eloquent confession of a devout soul, written in the sim-&#xD;
\ plest, purest, most iiomatic English-a hook which great literary ability could&#xD;
* not imitate either in feeling or style-John Bunyan's " Grace 'Abounding."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.,                        117&#xD;
"It is a masterpiece," he said reverently, after glancing at her with sur-&#xD;
prise. " It equals Herodotus in childlike grace, and it surpasses him in sub-&#xD;
limity and pathos. There are passages in it which have made me turn to the&#xD;
epistles of Paul, to see which is the greater saint and the greater writer. Will&#xD;
you allow me to give it to you?"&#xD;
"I thank you," replied the girl, while a flush of gratitude .colored her ei-&#xD;
tire face, there was such abundance and fervor in it.&#xD;
"She feels the need of abounding grace and mercy," thought Lehming to&#xD;
himself. "I am'in the solemn and awful presence of a profoundly troubled&#xD;
soul."&#xD;
They looked at each other in serious silence, regardless of John Bowlder&#xD;
and Imogen-Eleonore, who were holding some nondescript babble at the other&#xD;
end of the room.&#xD;
" You are more kind than I know how to tell-you,"i continued Nestoria.&#xD;
"If I could tell you how much your kindness touches me, you would be aston-&#xD;
ished.&#xD;
"My dear child, you alarmi me-" sighed Lehming. "I fear that I am not&#xD;
so worthy and wise a friend as you need."&#xD;
Nestoria was on the point of answering, "You are no doubt far better than&#xD;
I deserve; " but she did not dare come so near to a confession of her haunting&#xD;
horror; she remained silent.&#xD;
"Ilave you ino relatives, no intimates? " Lehming presently inquired.&#xD;
I am quite alone," she responded, after a moment of natural hesitation.&#xD;
Could you trust me to find you some acquaintances, such as I should judge&#xD;
suitable? "&#xD;
She shook her head. "No, no. I have no time for society. I must work&#xD;
all the while. It will be all I need if I see you and your cheerful, pleasant&#xD;
friend. I like him, he has such kind eyes."&#xD;
It shall be as you wish," bowed Lehming. " You shall see us every day,&#xD;
andl no one else. I trust that you will comie to this room freely and iake use&#xD;
of everything in it precisely as if it were your own."&#xD;
"I thank you," said Nestoria. "I will come now and then-perhaps every&#xD;
day."&#xD;
And with this understanding the interview ended, the two young women&#xD;
returning to their own rooms.&#xD;
'Those men seem very, very good," observed: Nestoria to Imogen, when&#xD;
they were alone. " I don't believe that either of thein could commit a crime."&#xD;
What stra-nge speeches you do make! " stared Miss Jones, absolutely&#xD;
envious of an .eccentricity of thought or sentiment wvhich she felt herself inea-&#xD;
pable of rivalling. " Who that one really knows, who of all the feeble beings&#xD;
tlhiat one is daily obliged to herd with, is capable of the sublimity of crime?&#xD;
If I knew a man who dared be a wretch," she continued, rolling nimoc k-heroic'&#xD;
eyes, "I could wor-ship him. Grandeur of soul, whether for good or evil, is&#xD;
what I seek through the feeble-oh how feeble !-inanities of corxmnonplace&#xD;
life."&#xD;
One is tempted to make along pause over the contrast presented by these&#xD;
twp young women; the one forever strutting in simulated gloom andl 'real sat-&#xD;
isfaction through some sham tragedy of thme fancy; the other speechles's and al-&#xD;
most crushed under that panth erishm thing Which a real romance almost always&#xD;
is. But there is no need of philosophizing;r the situation is visible at the first&#xD;
glance.&#xD;

118                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
",You must not speak in that way," replied Nestoria quietly, though with&#xD;
an inward shudder. " God may some day take you at your word and grant&#xD;
your desire. You would be very wretched."&#xD;
Secretly awed by the solemnity of this warning, Imogen Eleonore gave one&#xD;
stare at her unfathomable companion, and then turned for cheering diversion&#xD;
to the evening newspaper. As usual she read first the marriages and then the&#xD;
obituaries.&#xD;
"Nobody is dead that I know," she sighed. " And only one person who&#xD;
seems to be of any note. The paper calls'him the celebrated missionary, Doc-&#xD;
tor Bernard. Died at Erzeroum, August 5th. What a dolefully dull sheet!&#xD;
Do you want to look at it?"&#xD;
Nestoria mechanically took the journal, rose from her chair with a great ef-&#xD;
fort, walked unsteadily into her own room, and closed the door behind her.&#xD;
"What a queer piece!" thought Miss Jones. "She has such starts and&#xD;
ways that sometimes she puts me out of all patience. Let her go and freak it&#xD;
out alone."&#xD;
But half an hour later she thought she heard sobbing in Nestoria's room,&#xD;
and, forgetting her petulance, she went to see about it. The orphaned girl lay&#xD;
on her bed, tossing and twitching spasmodically, her eyes dry and feverish and&#xD;
her face flushed.&#xD;
"You are ill, Nettie," said Imogen. "Why didn't you call me? I must&#xD;
go and get it doctor."&#xD;
"No, no! " gasped Nestoria, starting up on her elbow and putting out one&#xD;
hand in earnest protest.&#xD;
"But you need one," urged Miss Jones. "I am afraid you are going to be&#xD;
real sick."  _-&#xD;
"Oh, let me be sick!" pleaded Nestoria, tired of life and longing to die.&#xD;
"I beg of you not to call any one."&#xD;
Daunted by such despair, and overcome by its imperious tone of urgency,&#xD;
Imogen Eleonore sat down.&#xD;
But an hour later she slyly slipped out, hurried to the reading-room, found&#xD;
Lehming there writing, and whispered, " My lttle friend is dreadfully ill."&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
WHITHER, 0 WHITHER?&#xD;
" AND she won't have a doctor!" continued Imogen Eleonore with mingled'&#xD;
pity and horror, as if here were a piece of either madness or blasphemy.&#xD;
The sympathetic Lelining sprang to his feet, ready to scour the entire city&#xD;
for help. But he was not one of those headlong good souls who trample&#xD;
blindly into a case of distress and save looking-glasses by pitching them out&#xD;
of a window. Even while he threw down his pen and rose from his table he&#xD;
had a gleam of that meditative, considerate wisdom which was one of his fin-&#xD;
est intellectual traits, and which frequently enabled him to make his deeds as&#xD;
gracious as his purposes. Little as he had consorted with women in society,&#xD;
he had noted the impulsive promptness with which they turn in trouble to a&#xD;
healer or consoler, whether in the guise of physician, or clergyman, or confi-&#xD;
dant. The fact that this girl should in her illness refuse to see a doctor struck&#xD;
hiim as very singular and very significant. Either she was a person of rare&#xD;
courage, or she was in strange circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.          '             119&#xD;
. WW will not call any one, unless it proves necessary," he said. "Perhaps&#xD;
this is duly a sickness of the mind," he added, remembering the plaintive mys-&#xD;
tery which he had detected in Nestoria's face and demeanor. " Will' you&#xD;
please ask if I may come in with you and see her for just one moment?&#xD;
Imogen Eleonore hurried away much comforted; she had laid her burden&#xD;
of responsibility and alarm on the 'shoulders of 'another; and, like most of her&#xD;
sex, or, perhaps I should say, like most of both sexes, she found the act cheer-&#xD;
ing. But she did not return for many minutes, and Lehning said to himself,&#xD;
"I shall not be received."&#xD;
So it proved. Nestoria would see no one, neither physician nor confessor.&#xD;
She bore this new and terrible affliction as she had borne all those other terri-&#xD;
ble ones which preceded it-alone. And she did really bear it; that is, she&#xD;
did not sink under it. Already she was like an otter, or other hunted beast,&#xD;
torn at by many hounds; one more snarling and mangling enemy made no&#xD;
difference, or seemed to make none. Indeed, the multitude of tormentors&#xD;
rather helped her to endure the suffering which each one inflicted; they'&#xD;
crowded each other away from their victim, and the poison of one bite neu-&#xD;
tralized that of another. It is marvellous, but it is nevertheless a fact, that&#xD;
brave souls can withstand a host of afflictions, almost as easily as one. It is&#xD;
brooding over a single calamity which brings on prostration and stupor, and&#xD;
which kills. Many blows at 'once, falling from all sides, keep the mind in ac-&#xD;
tivity. We are roused by a sense of injustice; we are exhilarated as by a&#xD;
physical conflict; and from the passion of battle we gather life.&#xD;
It is true that most persons might have been crushed by what Nestoria en-&#xD;
dared at this time. But she had a vigor of constitution, 'both physical and&#xD;
anoral, which.kept her out of sickness and out of despair. There could hardly&#xD;
be a more healthy creature than this small and seemingly delicate young&#xD;
woman. And health, the mere well-being of the body, is the spring of almost&#xD;
all human strength. With few exceptions the' men who have (lone great&#xD;
things in this world have been distinguished by enormous vitality, while many&#xD;
of 'them have been remarkable for muscular power. Plato was a boxer; By-&#xD;
rou was an athlete and could swim eight miles; Washington, Scott, and&#xD;
Wordsworth had muscles of iron; Lincoln could lift a thousand pounds. We&#xD;
do not mean to insinuate that Nestoria xyah intellectually great like these men,&#xD;
but only that she had somewhat of their moral vigor, and that it sprang from&#xD;
the same cause, health.&#xD;
We must pass over a (lay or two in the girl's history. It is impossible to&#xD;
describe adequately the.suflerings of a bereaved soul while its loss is fresh&#xD;
upon it; you might as well try to paint in mere words the agonies of victims&#xD;
in Dominican chambers of torture. Showy the rack and the. thumbscrews and&#xD;
the lacerating knives of the deadly " virgin," and leave the conception of&#xD;
what these-things can inflict to the imagination of the spectator.&#xD;
A day passed like a car of Juggernaut over Nestoria; a day which to her&#xD;
fellow lodgers seemed; sickness, but which was merely anguish; a drama in&#xD;
which the mightiest and cruellest feelings that can 'find room in the human&#xD;
heart were the actors; a battle worthy of having angels and demons for com-&#xD;
batants, if indeed such were not actually present. At the .end of that twenty-&#xD;
four hours she still retaied life, reason, and even physical strength.  She&#xD;
camne out upon her little world of three persons, much the same that they had.&#xD;
previouslyT known her. Imogen Eleonore, returning- from a hasty twilight&#xD;
shopping excursion, peeped into the sick-room to see how her patient fared,&#xD;
and found her painting.&#xD;

120                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"I am so glad you have got well!" she exclaimed, moved by such honest&#xD;
feeling that she spoke siipply..&#xD;
"I have not been sick," replied Nestoria, looking up with the patient smile&#xD;
of one who has truly learned to endure.'&#xD;
"Not been sick! " stared Miss Jones. "Why, you've been looking dreaid-&#xD;
fully-just like a ghost."&#xD;
"Yes, I have had a bad play, it is true. What I meant was that I have had&#xD;
no serious illness. I am not accustomed to call myself sick so long as I can&#xD;
get up when I wish to."S&#xD;
" Well, you are a strange piece'!" continued Imogen, still marvelling at&#xD;
this sudden recovery, which struckher as something like a resuscitation. "I&#xD;
wonder if you are made like other people. Do let me feel of you. Why, your&#xD;
cheek is as hard as marble. I never felt such solid flesh. How strong you&#xD;
must be! Are you as hard as that all over?"&#xD;
"My father has often remarked how firm my flesh was," replied Nestoria.&#xD;
She stopped; she had inadvertently mentioned her father; at times his&#xD;
death seized unreal to her. But the moment she recalled the fact, speech on&#xD;
any subject became an impossibility, at least for a time.&#xD;
"have you a father? " asked Imogen Eleonore, in that melodramatic voice&#xD;
which she put on as a garment whenever she made her entry upon what seemed&#xD;
to her a great subject,&#xD;
Nestoria shook her head and tried to go on painting; but the blundering&#xD;
shock of this inquiry was too much for her; she dropped her brush, covered&#xD;
her face with her hands, and burst into tears. They vere the first tears which&#xD;
she had shed upon her bereavement, ahd they came rather as a rain of mercy&#xD;
than as a storm of castigation.  . ,                    .&#xD;
Long dead?" queried Miss Jones, trusting that curiosity might seem to be&#xD;
sympathy, and indeed conscious of a cordial sympathy beneath an equally fer-&#xD;
vid curiosity. But Nestoria, deafened by the tempest of her own sobbing, was&#xD;
spared from hearing the loutish question.'&#xD;
Imogen Eleanore, who, in spite of her relish for ghoulish literature, was&#xD;
really a human being, presently'became ashamed of herself and then piti-&#xD;
ful. She was not accustomed to witness strong emotions, except through the&#xD;
dingy veil of letter-press and woodcuts; and she recoiled from this violent&#xD;
paroxysm of grief as she would have flinched from the actual presence of&#xD;
wounds and blood.&#xD;
"I am'awfully sorry!" she apologized. "I was not aware of the plaintive&#xD;
abyss of the unknown from which my careless foot extorted this cry of soul&#xD;
agony. It was not that my heart was lacking in the tendrils of tenderness,&#xD;
but only that I have had no such sad, sorrowful, solemn experience. I never&#xD;
lost a payrent."&#xD;
To this simple and egotistic girl it seemed as if no grief could resist such&#xD;
soothing, or. fail to be charmed by such excases. But the soul before her was&#xD;
in truly deep waters; and, dim as 1mogen'u spiritual eyesight was, she pres-&#xD;
ently became troublously aware of the fact; she seemed to discern a spirit&#xD;
tottering, and sinking amid raging, obscure billows. Nestoria's spasm of sob-&#xD;
bing was so fierce and persistent that it fairly teiiied the inadequate com-&#xD;
forter.                                    -     -    -.&#xD;
."For pity's sake don't cry that wany," she implored. "You'll strain your--&#xD;
self and burst a blood-vessel. Why, your face is all crimson. .Oh, doit be so&#xD;
unhappy! You make me cry, and scare me."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Slender as was this stream of consolation, and turbid too with the common&#xD;
clay of the nature . rhich yielded it, nevertheless .it had force and subtlety&#xD;
enough to reach the bereaved heart.' It was received there with gratitude:&#xD;
extreme anguish is not exacting nor fastidious: Dives in his torments asked&#xD;
for but a single drop of water.&#xD;
Nestoria withdrew one hand from her face, let it glide slowly down Imo-&#xD;
gen's extended arm, and took an infantile hold on the skirt of her dress. The&#xD;
gesture, as we remember, was characteristic of her; it was her favorite man-&#xD;
ner of claiming sympathy and support. Imogen thought very strange of it,&#xD;
and said to herself that this was surely the oddest girl that she had ever met;&#xD;
but within the. last minute or so she had caught a grace of delicacy which&#xD;
enabled her to resist all blundering temptations to speech; the one wise, gen-&#xD;
tle thing which she did was to lay her hand upon the tremulous hand which&#xD;
clung to her. The two girls sat thus, fingers intertwined with fingers, while&#xD;
the tempest of sobs slowly died away, like waves lapsing to rest.&#xD;
"It is over," said Nestoria at last, forcing such a plaintive smile as a re-&#xD;
signed ghost might wear on returning to its grave. -"How patient and kind&#xD;
you are! I shall always love you."&#xD;
It was the last violent throe of grief which Imogen ever witnessed in her&#xD;
friend. Ienceforwaid Nestoria was able to draw a veil of obscuring tran-&#xD;
quillity over her filial sorrow, as well as over her perplexities and terrors.&#xD;
Secrecy at every point was an absolute necessity; she must not even mourn&#xD;
visibly and audibly for her father. If ever the tears came into her eyes at the&#xD;
thought of his burial afar off in a spot unknown to her, she drove the piteous,&#xD;
pleading drops back to their lair, as ene.nies who might betray and ruin her.&#xD;
If a sob burst up from her deserted heart, she made cruel haste to smother it&#xD;
before some accusing voice should respond, " Are you not she whom justice&#xD;
seeks? "&#xD;
Hardly dared she go deeply veiled to purchase such religious periodicals as&#xD;
she supposed might contain notices of her father's life and the manner of his&#xD;
death; and when she had obtained them, she read them in watchful solitude&#xD;
and then hid them under her mattress, as if they were proofs of crime. The&#xD;
four or five obituaries and eulogies which came to her hand were of course in-&#xD;
finitely precious to her ; and she longed to cut them out and keep them always&#xD;
near her heart and ready for her eye. But that would not do, for, if they were&#xD;
discovered in her possession, they might suggest her identity. Her grief was&#xD;
held in check by her constant dread of discovery and of the results which dis-&#xD;
covery would surely bring in its train. She was like a child shut up in a dark&#xD;
room, who dares not sob for fear of being overheard by sonicmonster.&#xD;
Meantime what should she do? The angel of death had changed the'face&#xD;
of the world to her; he had swept clean out of life her only imaginable refuge.&#xD;
Her situation was that of a wanderer in deserts who hears that the oasis to-&#xD;
wards which he was faintly struggling has been overwhelmed by sandstorms,&#xD;
its sheltering palhs uprooted and its wells choked.  During weeks, which&#xD;
flowed with the scorching. slowness of melted lead, Nestoria had been sup-&#xD;
ported by the hope of reaching her father, and casting at his feet that horrible&#xD;
secret, so like to a mangled and blood-dripping corpse which a demoniacal&#xD;
destiny'had fastened upon her. Now there was no one in all the earth to re-&#xD;
lieve her of her grisly load,; she must bear it alone until she should be able to&#xD;
lay it beside her* in her grave. There were times when the whole of this wea-&#xD;
ryinig pilgrimage seemed to open before her, the vastness of the inhospitable&#xD;

outlook drinking up all her strength and courage, as the Sahara absorbs a riv-&#xD;
ulet at the beginning of its course.&#xD;
But she must not faint; she must struggle to shape her future so that it&#xD;
should be bearable; especially must she discover and attain to some place of&#xD;
hiding. With a travail of spirit which was so imn ease and various that we&#xD;
may speak'of it as her labors of Hercules, she ransacked the whole world for&#xD;
an asylumi. Where was the spot which could give security to a- friendless&#xD;
girl, whose terrible treasure, eagerly sought for by whole communities, was&#xD;
the secret of a murder ?&#xD;
Little by little she settled upon the resolution that as soon as she had money&#xD;
enough for the vojage, she would fly to some barbarous island of the Pacific&#xD;
ocean, there to end in obscurity her outcast life.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
&#xD;
A SAD FAIRY AND A COMFORTING BROWNIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THIS thought of a flight to the unknown and almost unknaginable coral&#xD;
solitudes of the Pacific took a strong hold on Nestoria's imagination.&#xD;
It helped her bear onward her heavy days, and at night it sometimes lulled&#xD;
her to sleep. As she bent over her painting she had reveries of floating over&#xD;
long, smooth billows, under the white, tranquil wings Of sailing seabirds, to-&#xD;
ward inlets alive with canoes and shores waving with palms. The same pic-&#xD;
tures came to her in dreams; she was among wild peoples, but free from per-&#xD;
plexities and terrors; she lived the life -of a savage, but she was at peace. So&#xD;
happy was she in these visions that more than once she shed a few tears on&#xD;
awaking. As is often the case with the quietly wretched, the sorrowful who&#xD;
see .no immediate escape in effort, she slept much. In sleep she forgot her&#xD;
alarms, griefs, remorse; in sleep there was a temporary trace to her warfare;&#xD;
she could lay down her arms when she lost her senses. , We see a spirit which,&#xD;
though able to bear much, felt great weariness. Her reveries, and the eager-&#xD;
ness with which she hailed them, proved how enfeebled was her mind. or rather&#xD;
how tired. The soul which is faint with hard and long rowing, lands willing-&#xD;
ly on this Lotos island of revery.                                )&#xD;
Much, however, as the girl's thoughts partook of the nature of day-dreams,&#xD;
she was serious in her purpose of seeking refuge in the Pacific. She really&#xD;
meant to get to the Marquesas, or some other more unfrequented archipelago,&#xD;
and bury all her future years in its rank savagery. Perhaps she would be a&#xD;
missionary; perhaps spend her life in proclaiming the true God to heathens;&#xD;
it would be a fitting work for one who had been such a criminal; itvould be&#xD;
a Pauline repentance. For she still believed that she acted very wickedly in.&#xD;
refusing to expose the guilt of Edward Wetherel,. and longed to do some wor-&#xD;
thy work and bear some self-inflicted penalty, which might make partial&#xD;
amends for her sin, even though justification and 'forgiveness were unattaina-&#xD;
ble. Yes, a missionary life in the Pacific, suflring enormous hardships, in-,&#xD;
curring daily peril of death, and perhaps putting on the crown of martyrdom,&#xD;
was the career toward which she must strive. ' But before she could take flight&#xD;
she must have wings; an'd she labored incessantly to fabricate them, adding&#xD;
dollar to dollar. .&#xD;
Meantime she could not dispense entirely with human fellowship. A trou-&#xD;
bled woman instinctively looks for help to a man; and now that Nettie no&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
longer saw her father walking the stormy sea of life, she felt a need of some&#xD;
other virile saviour; before she was well aware of it she was stretching out the&#xD;
arms of her soul toward Lehming. It was very natural. There was as it&#xD;
were an-aureole of sweetness and light-the sweetness of rich sympathy and&#xD;
the light of a clear intelligence-around the niisshapen head of this good pyg-&#xD;
my, easily visible to eyes seeking a deliverer. She had sagacity enough to feel&#xD;
(rather than to formally argue out) his superiority.in real moral muscle over&#xD;
John Bowlder, burly as this last might seem to a superficial glance. Every&#xD;
day she sought more and more the society of Lehming, and found more sup-&#xD;
port and pleasure in it.&#xD;
As for him, he was eager to give her all the aid and counsel and pity that&#xD;
she would ask, for,-or could be brought to accept. No other human being, not&#xD;
even Edward Wetherel, under the blight of an imputed crime, had ever inter-&#xD;
ested him so deeply as did this lonely, patient-eyed girl. When a man's heart&#xD;
is naturally sweet, every intellectual force that he possesses tends to increase&#xD;
its sweetness. Lehining was all the more benevolent because he had a strong&#xD;
imagination and unusual powers; of reflection. It seemed to him that he had.&#xD;
found a soul shipwrecked on the reefs of some unknown sorrow, and he longed,&#xD;
incessantly to nurse it to health and give it deliverance. He was too delicate&#xD;
to intrude into Nettie's mystery by questions; but he accorded to her such&#xD;
watching and attentions as affection grants to an invalid. There was an inex-&#xD;
haustible willingness to listen to her in the rare hours when she chose to talk;&#xD;
there was a copious outpouring of instruction and amusement from his stores&#xD;
of knowledge; there were daily offerings of flowers and fruit. He knew the&#xD;
preciousness of little marks of regard, because he had rarely received them and&#xD;
had suffered from the lack of them.&#xD;
His demeanor toward her had somewhat of the subtle perfume of court-&#xD;
ship. He was far indeed from meaning it as such, for he had not the slightest&#xD;
hope of winning the girl's heart,"and desired only to give forth his own wealth&#xD;
of emotion. Never forgetting his deformity of body and feature, and alto-&#xD;
gether unconscious of his attractive beauty of soul, he was humility itself.&#xD;
The idea of wooing and winning a handsome young woman would have seemed&#xD;
to him nothing better than frenzy. Nevertheless, as time went on, he swung&#xD;
insensibly nearer to this frenzy, approaching it by unconscious circlings, as a&#xD;
boat nears.the Maelstrom. There was to come a period in his life when he'&#xD;
would like a woman precisely as other men like women. He was destined to&#xD;
fall in love with Nestoria, and toward that fate he was even now drifting.&#xD;
Not a day passed without a meeting between them. As we have said, the&#xD;
door of Lehming's library was always open to all the inhabitants of the tene-&#xD;
mieit-house. But the lodgers in the lower floors did not care to enter it; they&#xD;
were of that hurried class who write upon the doors of their offices, " Gone to&#xD;
dinner-back in ten minutes "; they were so dragged about by the almighty&#xD;
dollar that they had no time or no taste for reading. Nestoria soon discovered&#xD;
that she vas not liable to meet any one in the library besides its owner and&#xD;
John Bo Ider and Imogen Eleonore; and thus she fell into a habit of visiting&#xD;
it every evening, when darkness forbade her to walk and her hand was&#xD;
cramped with painting. Lehming was almost always there, sometimes ab-&#xD;
sorbed in a book, but more often writing. There was an exchange of smiles&#xD;
-two of the sweetest and most pathetic smiles ever seen; then Nestoria se-&#xD;
lectecl her volume or magazine, and seated herself by the long centre-table;&#xD;
after that there might be half an hour without a sound except. the turning of&#xD;
leaves or the scratching of a pen.&#xD;
&#xD;

YIi&#xD;
&#xD;
124&#xD;
&#xD;
'THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
The very silence of Lehming was an aroma from his exquisite delicacy.&#xD;
He feared that if he talked much to his guest he would have an air of demand-&#xD;
ing amusement from her, and so render his hospitality less free. Moreover,&#xD;
he found it necessaryto resist the first encroachments of a compassionate cu-&#xD;
riosity which perpetually tempted him to put such questions to her concerning&#xD;
her history as she might perhaps not desire to answer. Consequently .he laid&#xD;
down for himself the rule that he must never put aside his pen until she had&#xD;
first put aside her book. Is it not touching and'indeed downright piteous to&#xD;
find such considerateness and self-control in one at whose feet life had laid so&#xD;
few favors and pleasures? But it is in just such humble vessels that we might&#xD;
expect to-discover these rare graces. We must stoop to'figures weighed down&#xD;
by crosses, and look under-the acute shadows of crowns of thorns, if we would&#xD;
behold the brows which wear the brightest halos.&#xD;
Sometimes, however, there were long conimunings between these two chil-&#xD;
dren of sorrow. Their talk frequently concerned literature, for Lehming was&#xD;
a contributor to various periodicals, and furthermore he had the project of a-&#xD;
book on his mind, and he loved to discuss the art in which lie was a student.&#xD;
One of these dialogues we may find it 'worth while to listen to, because, al-&#xD;
though it began upon the most commonplace circumstances of a life of author-&#xD;
ship, it eventually wound and crept on until it touched the borders of Nesto-&#xD;
ria's woful secret.&#xD;
"Is making stories very profitable? " inquired the girl, wondering whether&#xD;
she could write and thus earn money wherewith to fly to undiscoverable&#xD;
islands.&#xD;
"It brings in something," replied Lehming, entering eagerly upon a sub-&#xD;
ject which profoundly interested him. "In the monthlies, weeklies, and dai-&#xD;
lies there is a fair market for tales and articles. A mugazinist with talent,&#xD;
who works hard and gives all his time to his work, can average twelve or per-&#xD;
haps fifteen hundred dollars a year. In other words, he can earn something&#xD;
more than a common carpenter, and a good deal less than an expert machin-&#xD;
ist. But whea you have made that modest statement, you have summed up&#xD;
nearly the whole of a writer's chance for income.  The profit on a book,&#xD;
speaking in a general way, would not suppd.i-tlu infant. People say that the&#xD;
periodical has killed the volume; but while this is true in a measure, it is not&#xD;
all the trouble; it is mainly the foreign reprint which kills the American work.&#xD;
Are you aware that any one of our publishers can seize upon any European&#xD;
book without paying the author a penny? Such is the dishonest fact; now&#xD;
look at the discouraging result. The American volume (let us suppose it is&#xD;
Leimning's) is necessarily loaded with a royalty payable to the writer ; this roy-&#xD;
alty is only the pittance of ten per cent. in most cases, but it raises the price&#xD;
of the work by that amount; if without it the price would be ninety cents, for&#xD;
instance, it must now be sold at a dollar. Well, what sort of competition is&#xD;
this dollar book exposed to? The competition of Dickens, Reade, Thackeray,&#xD;
and all the athletes of foreign literature-all selling ten per cent. cheaper. Ten&#xD;
per cent.? I should conic nearer the mark in saying twenty-five per cent., fifty&#xD;
per cent. Our 'publisher only selects for reprints the best of European works,&#xD;
such as have already succeeded in their own country-such as are sure to suc-&#xD;
ceed here. He is so certain of purchasers that he can afford to be cheap, and&#xD;
also to advertise liberally. ie is so certain of competition if he demands a&#xD;
high price, that he must be cheap. You will find Dickens and Reade and many&#xD;
others on our book counters at fifty and thirty cents a volume. Now, what does&#xD;
the purchaser do? Do you imagine that he will buy Lehming at a dollar when&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
125&#xD;
&#xD;
lie can get Lehming's master at half a dollar? He makes the bargain that will&#xD;
give hin the most for his money, and in so doing he helps to kill American&#xD;
literature. It is the only business in our country in which the producer is&#xD;
completely sacrificed- to the consumer. The result is that we have no litera-&#xD;
ture; we have only a dozen or so of professed authors; and that dozen write&#xD;
mainly for the monthlies and weeklies, The American book is growing rarer&#xD;
year by year, and will soon be as extinct as the dodo. Men will not continue&#xD;
a labor which brings them only neglect and starvation"&#xD;
"But a few write," said Nestoria. "You write."&#xD;
"A few will always write," answered Lehming. " Every year five or six&#xD;
tyros step forward and awkwardly renew a useless struggle. But the circum-&#xD;
stances of the case are inexorable; they wear out the most hopeful and the&#xD;
ablest spirits. We shall never have practised and skilful authors until we- es-&#xD;
tablish such an international copyright as will enable the native work to enter&#xD;
th0 market on equal terms with the foreign reprint. This competition of theft,&#xD;
moreover, is not the only trouble. Literature in our country is shackled with&#xD;
imposts and with customs duties. Paper, types, type metal, the materials for&#xD;
binding, everything which goes to the making of a book, bears a load of taxa-&#xD;
tion for the benefit of some manufacturer. Our publishers themselves are so&#xD;
burdened th at they are unable to hold our own market, and are steadily be-&#xD;
coming nere distributors for English publications. It seems as if our legisla-&#xD;
tors had sworn that, whatever else they left undone. they would root out Amer-&#xD;
ican literature."&#xD;
"I don't fully understand, but it seems very discouraging," sighed Nesto-&#xD;
ria. " I was wondering whether I could write; but I will make you a present&#xD;
of ny subject."  Then, after a moment of pondering, she went on hastily, as&#xD;
if imj elled to speak, " I had a strange idea in my mind. It was that a girl&#xD;
should like some one, and like him very,overy much, only to find that he was&#xD;
utterly wicked. Then what? ' Should she merely abandon him? . Or should&#xD;
she denounce him to punishment? I don't know. I can't see how it should&#xD;
end."&#xD;
"She should both abandon and denounce him," answered Lehminig with the&#xD;
facile promptness of poetical justice.&#xD;
Nestoria recoiled from him a little, pressed her hands together, and turned&#xD;
slightly pale.&#xD;
"Stop," added the young man meditatively. "You have proposed a diffi-&#xD;
cult problem. We must not judge even fictitious personages with haste ajid&#xD;
indifference. -If we do not owe a duty to their shadowy existences, we owe&#xD;
one to our own mental and moral nature. I must have tinie to consider your&#xD;
riddle."&#xD;
Nothing more was said on the subject; indeed, Nestoria -was frightened at&#xD;
'having said so much; but Lehming. brooded over her suggestion frequently.&#xD;
Of course he asked himself whether the girl had alludpd to the sorrow which&#xD;
looked out of 'her plaintive eyes; and of course the query, although unanswer-&#xD;
able, made her all the more attractive to his sensitive and compassionate spirit.&#xD;
Other conversations, and other vague, timid hints of suffering, quickened his&#xD;
sympathy. Even if there wvere no mystery of great trouble iii this child's life,&#xD;
he felt certain that she wasilonely and almost friendless, and he longed to sur-&#xD;
round her with consolation. Not yet, not even in the rare vagaries which he&#xD;
permitted to his imagination, did he purpose to offer her a heart in lal..ce of&#xD;
the one which, as he sometimes suspected, she had found cori'upt and cast&#xD;
away with noble loathing. liHe was too meek to believe that his affection could&#xD;

be worthy of complete acceptance, even at hands which pleaded for affection&#xD;
as a charity; and to ask any woman whatever to receive him as a husband&#xD;
would, it seemed to him, be altogether unnatural and monstrous, and shame-&#xD;
fully absurd.&#xD;
But he was slipping toward Nestoria; he was becoming every day less and&#xD;
less the ruler of his thoughts and feelings; there was no telling how his moth-&#xD;
like circlings might end. Eyes which in this matter were keener than his,&#xD;
though duller by far in almost all things else, watched him' with a pet-lanit&#xD;
disapproval, judging him to be very near the flame of love.&#xD;
"It will be real shabby if Mr. Lehming tries to marry that poor little chit,"&#xD;
said Imogen Eleonore to herself more than once. "Mr. Lehming ought to&#xD;
know that he isn't a proper person ,to have a pretty girl. He may be very&#xD;
good and have a first-rate education, but he's a little jolter-headed hunchback,&#xD;
and not a fit match at all for my Nettie.- If he wasn't a prominent instructor,&#xD;
I'd give him a piece of my mind about it."&#xD;
Miss Jones, we perceive, put the matter in order before her mind in plain,&#xD;
straightforward terms, not encumbering it with the retinue of bombastic&#xD;
phrases which she favored when in society. We may infer that she really and&#xD;
honestly feared lest the incongruous wooing of which she discoursed might&#xD;
come about.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
REMINISCENCES AND SUSPICIONS.&#xD;
IG, burly, and boisterous John Bowlder was scarcely less bewitched&#xD;
about Nestoria than the little and gentle Lehming.&#xD;
This transcendent sogl, this comet of the subjective universe, actually be-&#xD;
came somewhat realistle and business-like in his desire to befriend the lonely&#xD;
child. Divining by a prodigious effort of "insight" that she needed money&#xD;
as well as sympathy, he used up what he picturesquely called " the slack of&#xD;
his income " in buying her fans, as presents for his other pets; the said other&#xD;
pets, by the way, being not young ladies, but little ragged girls who went to&#xD;
Lehmning's Sunday-school, and who had no spare funds to expend on gew-&#xD;
gaws: "humble butterflies," as the philosopher phrased it, "who need some&#xD;
glorifying to fit them for life's sunshine."&#xD;
When Bo wider could no longer purchase, he appointed himself the artist's&#xD;
drmnmer or commercial traveller, and hawked her delicate merchandise from&#xD;
shop to shop with a pride which ennobled peddling. Such an outlandish pil-&#xD;
grim has seldom been seen in the marts of our American Vanity Fair. The&#xD;
shopmnen of Broadway and Canal street were dumbfounded by his other-world&#xD;
countenance, manners, and dialect.&#xD;
"Fans, my worthy friend, fans!" he would say, patting a dealer conde-&#xD;
scendingly on the shoulder. "Look at them! Not merely instruments to stir&#xD;
the lazy wind and cool the languid brow, but visions to steal through the win-&#xD;
dows of the .eye and transport the longing soul. In judging the market value&#xD;
of such a thing, you must look 'beneath the use and penetrate to the grace.&#xD;
Beauty has an aureole which decorates related objects. See here," spreading&#xD;
a fan, and fluttering it about his great rosy face and bushy, grizzly beard, "I&#xD;
am a finer creature than I was a moment ago. This little painting of birds&#xD;
and flowers lends me somewhat of its own aesthetic nature. I am a hand-&#xD;
somuer man because I have a handsome fan. There is loveliness,. purchasable&#xD;
at twenty dimes! What woman who should come to your counter could re-&#xD;
sist such a bargain? With glory like that to sell,-people will not only buy of&#xD;
you, but go away feeling enriched, and so return to buy again.' Take them,&#xD;
iny human friend take the lot and prosper. You can have the six infinite&#xD;
wonders for nine poor, finite 'dollars."&#xD;
The bargain consummated, he would eagerly butt his way homeward&#xD;
through the crowded streets, rush into Nestoria's presence with such vehe&amp;amp;&#xD;
mence as to make. little breezes all around him, toss the results of his peddling&#xD;
into her lap, and wave his big red hand in deprecation of thanks.  .&#xD;
Thus these three persons met and communed daily with tranquil counte-&#xD;
nances, when recognition would have made them stare at each other like&#xD;
startled ghosts. Bowlder and Lehming, both anxious to discover Nestoria&#xD;
Bernard and to unveil the Wetherel mystery, helped her in earning means to&#xD;
fly with it to the ends of the earth. It may seem incredible that they should&#xD;
be her companions for weeks without causing her to suspect their intimate ac-,&#xD;
quaintance with the tragedy which had driven her into hiding. But they were&#xD;
strange men, living mainly in a condition of isolation, and little, addicted to&#xD;
the gossip which forms so large a part of ordinary human converse.&#xD;

128                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
" Relatives are less to me than my own shadow," John Bowlder was accus-&#xD;
tomed to boast, with some exaggeration. "My shadow is in a measure the&#xD;
image of myself; but my cousin or brother may be discordant or antagonis-.&#xD;
wic. My true blood-connections are the people who share my thoughts and&#xD;
heart-beats, though they abide at the antipodes and catch rats and puppies for&#xD;
pies. Buddha is perhaps my father, and Confucius my uncle, and Ah Sin my&#xD;
brother."&#xD;
Acting in accordance with these whimwhams, as far as his really strong&#xD;
natural affections would let him, the ideological Bowlder prided himself on&#xD;
treating the every-day, essential afihirs of his life, with sovereign contempt,&#xD;
eschewing discourse concerning the people whom he knew and the things&#xD;
which he did, and talking mainly of matters that he was not acquainted with.&#xD;
Up to a certain point Lehming was very like him in this peculiarity of imper-&#xD;
sonal conversation. Their speech with each other was usually subjective,&#xD;
rather than objective. The one brimmed' over with literature, and the other&#xD;
spurted hogsheads of philosophy, but neither gave out much chitchat. Thus&#xD;
it happened that they never mentioned in Nestoria's presence the names of&#xD;
Dinneford and Wetherel. The murder they were the less likely to speak of,&#xD;
because it had already taken on the character of a mystery, fatiguingly incom-&#xD;
prehensible even to policemen. Edward Wetherel, too, we may as well state&#xD;
here, was the less present to their minds. for the reason that he was absent in&#xD;
body. In search of some reported trace of bloodstained feet, flying from the&#xD;
scene of his uncle's assassination, the young man had undertaken a detective&#xD;
journey to New Orleans, much to the disgust of such persons as held him to&#xD;
be the homicide.&#xD;
But the complications of this plot presently thickened into peril of revela-&#xD;
tions. Long before Nestoria had saved money enough to set out for the Canni-&#xD;
bal Islands, Edward Wetherel returned to New York. Lehming heard of it,&#xD;
and, mindful of his promise to stand by the suspected youth, resolved to go at&#xD;
once and see him. Not finding him at his lodgings, he pushed on to the Din-&#xD;
neford dwelling, and made a call there. Mrs. Dinneford, sitting spectacled&#xD;
over Headley's " Women of the Bible," beamed forth delight at sight of his&#xD;
trivial figure, and bustled forward to greet him with capstrings a-flying.&#xD;
"Why, Walter, ho Tv long you have been from us!" she cried in her hearty&#xD;
and little less than boisterous way. "I began to believe that you had fled to&#xD;
the desert and turned anchorite, like poor St. Simeon Stylites on his pillar, or&#xD;
like the old person in the *'Book of Nonsense,' who ran up a palm when the&#xD;
weather was calm, and surveyed all the ruins of Phite. It is more than a&#xD;
fortnight since you have visited our tabernacle. And we expected that you&#xD;
would give us the light of your countenance every evening! "&#xD;
"I ought to be ashamed of myself, and am," said Lehming. "But I have been&#xD;
amused, and been at work. Ah, what a blessing work is! It is the real sugar-&#xD;
coating of the pill of life. I have just finished a story which would not let me&#xD;
go until I had done my best by it. Moreover, I have some interesting fellow-&#xD;
lodgers, two young people who are developing under my eye, like buds turn-&#xD;
ing to flowers. It is fascinating business to watch the growth of souls. It is,&#xD;
you know, my business. I am a school-teacher by nature and habit. It is my&#xD;
daily occupation, and I love it. I am really more delighted with the toddling&#xD;
of a youthful spirit from weakness toward strength than with the sublime&#xD;
march of a mind which has reached its full powei'. I humbly venture to be-.&#xD;
lieve that I can understand a little the pleasure which Deity takes in survey..&#xD;
ing the evolution and glorious unfolding of his creation."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         129&#xD;
" Ah, Walter, you should have beena preacher instead of a schoolmaster,"&#xD;
replied Mrs. Dinneford. "I don't know how you kept out of the ministry.&#xD;
If ever a man that I know was called to wear the ephod and attend on the&#xD;
tabernacle, you are the man."&#xD;
"I did think of it and desire it," said Walter gravely. "You remember&#xD;
that I went so far as to take orders." Then he added with a smile, "But how&#xD;
awkward it would have been to be obliged to carry about a cricket to stand&#xD;
one Do you recollect a story about a little minister who made his audience&#xD;
giggle by just lifting his nose over the pulpit cushion and saying in a piping&#xD;
voice, 'It is I, be not afraid '? That story, more than anything else perhaps,&#xD;
rooted up my vain ambition to be a clergyman."&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford laughed heartily: The anecdote bore hard upon her pygmy&#xD;
favorite, but she knew that he would not be hurt by her merriment. More-&#xD;
over, she was one of those excitably jovial persons who do not find it easy to&#xD;
rule their sense of humor. She was a zealous church-goer; when she heard&#xD;
the bells ring, she rushed out like a fireman at t e sound of the fire-alarm;&#xD;
and on reaching the scene of combustion, she did) her duty as a hearer with&#xD;
heartfelt fervor; yet she had more than, once "laughed in meeting."&#xD;
"But I must tell you of my fellow-lodgers," continued Lehming. " There&#xD;
are two of them who honor me daily with their society, both young ladies, if&#xD;
I may apply the term to poor people-and to one of them I must apply it.&#xD;
She is interesting; she is fascinating. The other is a schoolmistress, an old&#xD;
acquaintance of mine, an untaught, uncultured soul, and rather a barren one.&#xD;
But the little lady is very different. I don't yet know what to make of her.&#xD;
She is a mystery and a waif. I wish you could see her."&#xD;
"I wish I could," said Mrs. Dinneford sympathetically. Then her mind&#xD;
was caught by that word "mystery," and she flew away on the weird wings&#xD;
of it. . She was a butterfly in discourse, driven about by the chance breezes of&#xD;
association, and capable of fluttering over a dozen topics in a minute.&#xD;
" And what a mystery that tragedy of poor dear Cousin, Wetherel has' be-&#xD;
come !," she copinued. " Was there ever anything so huge and hideous of&#xD;
mien which so swiftly and completely descended into the shadows! It seems&#xD;
as if the Adversary himself, the great dragon of the Apocalypse, had come out&#xD;
before us in 'all his most monstrous ugliness, so big and vast as to straddle&#xD;
quite across the way of our lives, onlyto disappear in the twinkling of an eye.&#xD;
One is tempted to imagine that he was permitted to show us his miraculous&#xD;
power in revealings and vanishings. There we were in our little nest at Sea&#xD;
Lodge, as unsuspecting of harm as children at play, when suddenly the awful&#xD;
talons were in the midst of us, and one of our cii'cle was stricken and lacer-&#xD;
ated unto death, and we neither heard the flutter of the wings nor saw the&#xD;
blow. - Moloch, the bloody king, was gone as quickly as he had come. One&#xD;
would say that he had authority over nature, and could march with a cloud.&#xD;
behind him, 'and cause earth to open under his feet. I never had anything so&#xD;
tax and terrify my imagination. I am ready to believe in the physical influ-&#xD;
ences of the Lords of Hell, as Tennyson calls them, and a noble sounding name&#xD;
it is, to be sure, and shows him to be a great poet. Do you remeniber how&#xD;
the magicians of Egypt wrought with their enchantments, and how Elymas the&#xD;
sorcerer was full of all malice and subtlety of the devil, and how Satan con-&#xD;
tended with Michael for the body of Moses? It seems to me- sometimes that&#xD;
We had cause for thankfulness in that the remain of our dear old friend and&#xD;
relative were spared us for sepulture. But Sin and Death left their victim;&#xD;

.yeonly took away their instrument. The iniquity of the righteous cannot&#xD;
hid; but the iniquity of the wicked is covered. I cannot get over it.. My&#xD;
1 is in a perpetual astonishment. I have had to fly of late to the Bible for&#xD;
utterances big enough to relieve my spirit. My favorite Tupper has~lost his&#xD;
power of charming. I find him as finite as myself."&#xD;
Lehming looked at Mrs. Dinneford with surprise and almost with rever-&#xD;
ence. The under-abyss of sentiment and imagination in this variable, this.&#xD;
sometimes commonplace woman, had flamed up as it were through her incon-&#xD;
sequences of thought and oddities of diction, rendering her for the moment lit-&#xD;
tle less than sublime.&#xD;
"Happy is the soul which knows the Scriptures'!" he said. "It can always&#xD;
find fitting words for its mightiest impressions. There are occasional events&#xD;
in' life which make  even Shakespeare seem as limited as Tupper. But the&#xD;
School of the Prophets had an inspiration lofty enough to mate the highest spir-&#xD;
itual needs of man."&#xD;
"Ah, yes,"' murmured Mrs. Dinneford, with an intonation of gratitude.&#xD;
Then a sudden gleam of humor danced out upon 'her puritanie face, much&#xD;
as if a Greek faun should appear capering upon Plymouth Rock.&#xD;
"A poor, bewildered policeman came to me yesterday," she resumed, to&#xD;
ask some further questions about the Wetherel affair, as he called it. The&#xD;
helpless man looked utterly disconsolate over his lack of success in discover-&#xD;
ing even a trail of the serpent. He said he had been working at this mill-&#xD;
stone for a month without finding a hole in it. I did want to take up my Bi-&#xD;
ble and read him a chapter to comfort him. But a false shame caught hold of"&#xD;
my garments of worldliness and held me back. All I could -muster the spirit&#xD;
to do was to quote a text or so."&#xD;
"I dare say you confounded him," smiled Lehming. " I doubt whether&#xD;
many New York policemen understand the speech of Zion."&#xD;
Ah, the speech of Zion!" repeated Mrs. Dinneford with a sort of spiritual&#xD;
smacking of the lips. "What a power and two-edged sharpness there is in&#xD;
that language, meaning thereby the plain words of the Scriptures without note&#xD;
or comment. Did you ever hear how' poor Cousin Wetherel hewed a Perfec-&#xD;
tionist in pieces before the Lord with a single text? It was at a prayer-meet-&#xD;
ing in West Haven last summer. This Perfectionist got the floor, and ex-&#xD;
horted with wonderful glibness and zea~l, and fairly seemed to have the uni-&#xD;
verse his own way for a while, so that one almost looked for the host of heaven to&#xD;
bow down and reverence him. The poor deluded creature had not committed&#xD;
sin for a week, he said, and he was hot with us all to go and do likewise.&#xD;
When he sat down Cousin Wetherel arose-and a grand, kingly, saintly spec-&#xD;
tacle he was, to be sure, with his white hair and persuaded countenance, and,&#xD;
his settled eyes piercing through all the nonsense of earth unto the heavenly&#xD;
realities. It was an apparition. The West Haven brethren stared as if they&#xD;
expected a revelation. I thought of that regicide judge who used to appear to&#xD;
our Now England fathers now and then, when they were in great straits, and&#xD;
work out some deliverance, or impart some counsel. He uttered just this one&#xD;
sentence: 'If we say that' we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and&#xD;
trtith is not in us;' then he sat down. It was awful. It seemed as ith&#xD;
longest-lived of the apostles had himself revisited earth to remind us of his&#xD;
own text. There was an end of perfectionism for that evening.".   fu-&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford had related this anecdote with as much gusto and cheerfii&#xD;
ness as if Cousin Wetherel were still in the land of the livig. Although he&#xD;

REAPPEARANCE OF THE FLIRTING PHILOLOGIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
FOR a moment Lehming was on the verge of saying to Mrs. Dinneford&#xD;
that he thought he had found Nestoria Bernard.&#xD;
But just then Alice Dinneford entered, fluttering and rustling and babbling&#xD;
in her usual lively way, like all the breezes and brooks of springtime. This&#xD;
young lady, as we perhaps remember, was sufficiently clever, and mere than&#xD;
sufficiently talkative, to be quite diverting, or at least occupying; no matter&#xD;
how fallen and withered conversation ,might be, she could arouse it and.send&#xD;
it flying and fill the air with it, like a gamesome urchin kicking up a bed of&#xD;
autumn leaves.&#xD;

was murdered, and although she sincerely reverenced and lamented him, his&#xD;
eccentricities had not lost their power of amusing her, and she could laugh as&#xD;
well as weep over his tombstone.&#xD;
" But .didn't I interrupt you a while ago, Walter?" she inquired, after&#xD;
catching her breath. "It seems to me that you were saying something  hic&#xD;
I broke into like a wolf into a fold. I am always blowing out other people's&#xD;
luminaries. Alice says I am as troublesome in a general conversation as a&#xD;
hornbug among lighted candles, flying now into this one and now into that,&#xD;
and extinguishing the whole batch."&#xD;
"I think I was speaking of my fellow-lodgers," replied Walter. "But I&#xD;
had pretty much finished with them."&#xD;
"One of them was a young lady, wasn't sheP" pursued Mrs. Dinneford&#xD;
"And she interested you? I don't wonder. Young ladies are such pretty&#xD;
things! Woman as I am, I can feel their charm. Every now and then I meet&#xD;
a girl inthe street whom'I want to take home and adopt. And when they are&#xD;
alone in. life, as I think you said this poor thing is, they pull at one's ery&#xD;
heartstrings.  They are so utterly helpless amidst the great rushing and&#xD;
strivings of this tumultuous, selfish world! A pretty girl without home er&#xD;
parents is scarcely better off than a bnby left on a doorstep. If she does#&#xD;
meet with charity, she meets with death. Oh dear! the subject is a sad one;&#xD;
'it cuts me like a knife. There is our poor little friend who vanished from&#xD;
among us as if Satan had put up his hand through the solid crust of the earth&#xD;
and drawn her into his abysmal darknesses. If she is alive, she is alone.&#xD;
and where? She hadn't a relative, nor "scarcely an acquaintanceson this&#xD;
broad continent. I do wish, Walter, that you could have seen her. Such a&#xD;
beautiful, sweet, touching little thing! She fairly bewitched me. As Tupper&#xD;
says, ' There is none enchantment against beauty, magician for all time.' .And&#xD;
her loveliness had such an innocence, such an other-world purity! She was&#xD;
like a beam of heavenly starlight visiting and cheering a lost planet. I never&#xD;
saw such sunny hair and such sky-like eyes and such a lily of a faee Sh&#xD;
was a vision, and vanished like one. What is the matter with you, Walter&#xD;
You seem to be absent-minded this evening."&#xD;
Lehining's eyes were bent upon the floor with an expression of profound&#xD;
msng    Mrs. Dinneford's enthusiastic description of Nestoria had struck him&#xD;
with the force of a revelation. For the first time, and with a vividness which&#xD;
made him wonder at his blindness hitherto, the suspicion reached him that&#xD;
the fugitive from Sea Lodge and Nettie Fulton might be the same person.&#xD;

132                 THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"1s it you, Cousin Walter?". she prattled, while her willowy figure so&#xD;
swayed and her feathery head so tossed that she reminded him of a cypress in&#xD;
a ,high wind. ~" Where have you been these three weeks? I thought you&#xD;
must be dead. I have expected every day to find you decapitated, with your&#xD;
body flopping about like a chicken's, and your head under some policeman's&#xD;
arm, smiling benignantly, as much as to say it was all right and you bore, no-&#xD;
body any grudge. Now, mamma, don't go to making a gravestone of your&#xD;
face, and setting it up over me. I won't be buried alive while I can catch my&#xD;
breath. You talked a great deal more at my age, and you say everything you&#xD;
can think of yet. Cousin Walter, I know why you are always so cheerful and&#xD;
never have the doldrums. You are not a young lady. Young ladies must be&#xD;
proper, and propriety always gives the doldrums, just as measles bring weak&#xD;
eyes. Such hencoops of old patched-up decorums as we women live in! And if&#xD;
you stick your head out for a grain of corn, somebody is ready to grab you and&#xD;
pull off your feathers and eat you up and pick your bones. Here is mother in&#xD;
a clucking state because I sit up, as they say.in the comitry, with a count. I&#xD;
told her I should leave it to you, the very first time you came in. Now do&#xD;
you think counts and foreigners are necessarily horrid? Are' we Yankees&#xD;
commissioned and chosen to abhor'them as the Jews abhorred the Canaanites?&#xD;
Do speak, Walter. Don't stop to meditate. I hate a sober second thought.&#xD;
It's a doleful, preachy phrase, as wizened and mean as a string of dried apples.&#xD;
Now tell me whether there is any sense to this prejudice against foreigners."&#xD;
"I share the prejudice," said Lehming gently.&#xD;
"'Walter, I am ashamed of you," answered Alice, beginning to color with&#xD;
a real excitement. "Oh, Walter, to have a prejudice! How unphilosophical&#xD;
and uncharitable!" /&#xD;
"Not because a stranger is not an American do I mistrust him," continued&#xD;
Lehming; "but because he is not at home; because he is surrounded by no&#xD;
public opinion to which he feels responsible; because he is too free from re-&#xD;
straint for; the good of human nature. We mortals are just so weak that we&#xD;
need all the social bonds to keep us from being wicked. Let us suppose a&#xD;
Turk in New York. He is far away from the judgment of his brother Otto-&#xD;
mans, and he has not yet learned to care for the judgment of Yankees. Don't&#xD;
you see that he has fewer guards against temptation than I have, or than he&#xD;
himself would have at home? It seems to me that he runs great risk of be-&#xD;
coming a naughty Turk."&#xD;
"But are we so very good?" broke in Alice eagerly. "What do you think&#xD;
of our city government? What do you think of the Ring?"&#xD;
" Take away the foreign vote of New York, and no ring could live long,"&#xD;
replied Lehming.&#xD;
"So you think," said Alice, beginning to pout, for the argument seemed to&#xD;
be against her. "But I hate politics, and don't want to talk about it. What&#xD;
I can't bear is that mother has a special dislike to this man because he' is a&#xD;
count. As if he would be any better if he were a butcher and the- son of a ba-&#xD;
ker and the nephew of a candlestick-maker!"&#xD;
"I don't want to be bewildered with words that I am not used to," de-&#xD;
clared Mrs. Dinneford. " When a man tells me that he is a count, I don't&#xD;
know what to expect of him. It's as perplexing as if he should tell me that&#xD;
he was a jabberwok. And especially when he has no county! A count in a&#xD;
republic, getting his living nobody knows how, seems to ine what our market-&#xD;
man calls a dubersome character, and I am always wondering what he was&#xD;

disinherited and banished for, and feel like addressing him in the words of&#xD;
Tupper, '0 degenerate scion of a stock so excellent and noble,' which I dare&#xD;
say would bother the head of our poor man tremendously, for his brains are&#xD;
no thicker than batter, in my opinion."&#xD;
"Wait and see, wait and see," retorted Alice. "I dare say he may be here&#xD;
this evening," she added, coloring with the consciousness that she knew very&#xD;
well that he would be there. ' "He is odd, but he is no fool. I used to think&#xD;
him one, and used to delight in making fun of him; but I have learned to&#xD;
know him better, and so will mamma some day; you see if she doesn't. I&#xD;
want you to talk to him, Walter; you will find that he has plenty of sense;&#xD;
that is, after you have got used to his ways. , Why, I suppose the cats and&#xD;
dogs don't think that we know anything till they learn how to take us. And&#xD;
now don't go to imagining that I am smitten. No such thing; I am not. I&#xD;
just defend the poor man because mother is unjust to him."&#xD;
"I hope that justice wouldn't be worse for him than injustice," replied Mrs.&#xD;
Iinneford, with an earnestness which had a taint of irritation. Apparently&#xD;
this matter of the Count had been discussed between mother and daughter un-&#xD;
til it had become a sore-subject to both of them.&#xD;
Just thenithe street bell rang, causing Alice to say, " There he is! " with a&#xD;
slightly hysterical giggle, and to sway and flutter in a way that was character-&#xD;
istic of her in moments of excitement. Presently the door opened, and a tall,&#xD;
blond gentleman, glorious with jewels and with glossy expanses of fine linen&#xD;
and with elaborate tailoring, entered the parlor, bowing and smirking in a&#xD;
style to strike most Anglo-Saxons dumb with astonishment. It was the first&#xD;
time that Lehming had beheld our old acquaintance, Count Poloski. The in-&#xD;
telligent, natural, and quiet pygmy -himself, as we believe, one ot nature's&#xD;
grandees-looked on the pretentious apparition with amazement and instanta-&#xD;
neous distrust. It did not seem possible to him that a -man who wore such&#xD;
millinery and went through such posturings could be a'born patrician. How-&#xD;
ever, he had seen the " Grande Duchesse "; he remembered that grotesque&#xD;
specimen of nobility, Prince Paul; and, conceding the resemblance between&#xD;
the two men, he suspended his judgment.&#xD;
Bowing and "tetering" across the room, the Count advanced to Mrs. bin.&#xD;
neford, took her hand, bent himself double over it, and said, "Madam, I once&#xD;
more do myself the honor of calling upon you."&#xD;
"I hope you have been well, sir?" replied the good lady, with a brevity&#xD;
which we know was not natural to her, and which sprang from embarrass-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
S"Madam, it is impossible for me to thank you sufficiently for your good&#xD;
wishes," 'the Count bowed again. "Never better. All the better for seeing&#xD;
you, as the song says. I need not inquii'o after your health. Your glowing&#xD;
countenance " (Mrs. Dinneford was fairly blushing for him) " reassures me.&#xD;
Miss Alice," and here he doubled up over the hand of the daughter, "your&#xD;
mother is a favorable augury for you. I trust that you will be-to use your&#xD;
vigorous American idiom-a chip of the old hickory."&#xD;
We have never heretofore seen in Poloski so much "manner " as he had on&#xD;
this occasion. An avowed suitor now of the "dashing Miss Alice," and anx-&#xD;
ious to make an impression upon the parent as well as upon the young lady,&#xD;
h- had put on the airs of a continental Tarveydrop. No turkeycock, gobbling&#xD;
and strutting and ruffing his feathers among female turkeys, was ever a more&#xD;
wonderful "model of deportment." Lebminug was unable to understand how&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6242-00000068"/>&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Alice could accord anysrespect or interest to such a grinning, polking, hyper-,&#xD;
bolical harlequin. He did not know how far the excitement of a debated con-&#xD;
quest may carry a young lady. The noble foreigner had made great inroads&#xD;
into Miss Dinneford's esteem, because she had found him a favored guest&#xD;
among the fashionables of Fifth -Avenue, and because plenty of other girls&#xD;
were setting their caps at him.&#xD;
"Count Poloski, this is my cousin," she said, fluttering through an incom-&#xD;
plete introduction. "My cousin, Mr. Lehming," she added hastily.&#xD;
Poloski bowed and smiled as if he were being presented to a peer of the&#xD;
British realm or a luminary of the French Academy.&#xD;
"My cousin is an author," continued Alice. anxious to impress the patrician&#xD;
favorably in regard to her family.&#xD;
"And a schoolmaster," added Lehming, which was the most malicious&#xD;
speech that he ever made in his life.&#xD;
"Professor, I am honored in making your acquaintance," salaamed the im-&#xD;
perturbable Poloski.,&#xD;
Alice triumphed over her cousin, and nearly laughed at him outright.&#xD;
"I am in the condition of a boy who gets a man's hat slipped over his little&#xD;
head," smiled Lehming. "The title of professor is too big for me."&#xD;
"But you teach," cajoled the Count, determined to make things pleasant.&#xD;
" What branch, may I inquire? Latin? Your cor~imon schools, as you wrong&#xD;
ly call them, are wonderful. They deserve a higher name. I am sincerely&#xD;
delighted to meet one who holds such a post in such a distinguished arena. I&#xD;
have some inquiries to make of you, if you permit them, and if these ladies&#xD;
permit."&#xD;
And here he commenced a catechism concerning the origins of the Latin&#xD;
speech; inquiring particularly whether it were purely Oscan, or whether the&#xD;
long domination of the Tarquins had introduced Etruscan elements; and&#xD;
showinga knowledge of the subject which argued at least some intimacy with&#xD;
encyclopedias.&#xD;
"You are too much for me," confessed Lehming. "I have no such learn-&#xD;
ing as will solve those problems."&#xD;
He looked at the fluent Poloski in surprise, wondering whether he were in-&#xD;
deed a scholar and a gentleman.&#xD;
"I have beaten him," triumphed the Count to himself. " He was doubting'&#xD;
me, but now he holds me in respect."&#xD;
"I wrote an essay on this topic," he said aloud. "I will show it to you&#xD;
some day."&#xD;
"But not to me," put in Alice, with the excusable petulance of a young lady&#xD;
who has been kept over-long out Qf the conversation.&#xD;
"Miss Dinneford, I humbly beg your pardon!" exclaimed Poloski, spread-&#xD;
ing out deprecating hands. "I am the most degraded of imbeciles. How&#xD;
can a man pass his time in talking of dead tongues when he might learn from&#xD;
the loveliest of teachers the noblest of living tongues!"&#xD;
" With all its beautiful slangs, Count," added Alice, laughing. But she&#xD;
did not banter him as freely as of old. He was no longer in her eyes the pure-&#xD;
ly comical personage which he had been in the days of their earlier acquaint-&#xD;
ance. In spite of her frolicsomeness and her affectation of flippant donina-&#xD;
tion, it was obvious that she was very anxious to please him, and even consid-&#xD;
erably in awe of him. Lehming perceived all this, and was sorry to perceive&#xD;
it. He feared nothing worse for Alice than a marriage withl a maan who night&#xD;

be a mere adventurer, without a penny and without a character; h. t that was&#xD;
a sufficiently ugly outlook to make the smallest glimpse of it a worry to this&#xD;
sympathetic and kindly spirit; and before he left the house he had resolved to&#xD;
keep an eye on. the noble foreigner. As he walked homeward he thought the&#xD;
little drama over, and became more interested in it with every hear t-beat.&#xD;
Here was a piece of home philanthropy to be attended to, and it might be that&#xD;
it needed instant and earnest vigilance.&#xD;
"We are always saving the heathen," hie said to himself. "I rust save&#xD;
my relative."&#xD;
To whom could he go to inquire about the antecedents and actualities and&#xD;
probabilities of this Poloski' Of fashionable people Lehining only knew Wol-&#xD;
verton, whom he had met but twice, and Edward Wetherel. As it was still&#xD;
far from late, he decided to make one more attempt to find Edward, and he set&#xD;
off at the longest stretch of his brief legs toward the young man's lodgings.&#xD;
Unsuccessful again, he turned toward his own sombre quarter of the city, and&#xD;
walked on with a still quicker step than before, anxious not to miss his cus-&#xD;
tomary "good-night " from Nettie Fulton. He had fallen to thinking of her,&#xD;
and was querying whether she could possibly be -Nestoria Bernard, when a&#xD;
voice behind him called him by name. He turned and waited; it was Edward&#xD;
Wetherel.&#xD;
"How lucky. I am to meet you! " said Lehming. "I have been twice te&#xD;
your lodgings."&#xD;
"And I was just searching for yours," replied Edward. "Is it too late to&#xD;
make you a callP"&#xD;
"Come along," urged -Lehming. "I want very much to see you about&#xD;
something which concerns us nearly."&#xD;
Presently it occurred to him that Wetherel might stumble upon Nettie Ful-&#xD;
ton in the reading-room, and that there might be a recognition. If so,- then&#xD;
what? Would the scene be joyful or horrible? He could not tell; but it&#xD;
seemed to him that it would be best to risk it; that the sooner this mystery was&#xD;
cleared up the better.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
DQLQROU   EAVESDROPPING.&#xD;
As Lehming was mounting the first stair of the tenement-house he came to&#xD;
a sudden halt and clung to, the' banister, panting.&#xD;
" What is the matter? " asked Wetherel seizing his little friend's arm, ard&#xD;
marvelling to find it tremulous and palpitating. " I have walked too fast for&#xD;
you. You should have remonstrated."&#xD;
"I am driven to confession," gasped Lehming, who could not, however,&#xD;
tell all the causes of his agitation. "I have-so my doctor tells me-a heart&#xD;
disease. Don't mind it-and don't apologize. I am fairly punished for not&#xD;
being willing, to avowmy infirmities. I have so many of them!"&#xD;
"A heart disease!" repeated ,Wetherel, surveying the sufferer with that&#xD;
superficial pity which a strong man may accord to an invalid, but at the same&#xD;
time able to admire him for not complaining. "You are an example to me.&#xD;
Do you smile at all your troublesP"&#xD;
" I have learned to do it," replied. Lehming. " Do you remember that&#xD;
comic martyr, that model of patient endurance, in the '-Book of' Nonsense 'P&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6242-00000069"/>&#xD;
130  .THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
There was an old man who said, How&#xD;
Shall I nee from this horrible cow?&#xD;
I will sit on this stile&#xD;
And continue to smile,&#xD;
Which may soften the heart of the cow.'&#xD;
That whimsical verse has been a prodigious support to me in my various&#xD;
little worries. The cow has bellowed and pushed a good deal, but I have gen.&#xD;
erally been able to smile, and it has helped. Well, let us get on. I can storm&#xD;
a few more stairs now. How I should like to make one of a scaling-party!"&#xD;
Reaching the foot of the last stairway, he looked up with some anxiety.&#xD;
He remembered that, whenever any one mounted to that floor, 'Nettie Fulton&#xD;
was apt to step out of the study and. glance over the banister, as if to spy into&#xD;
the nature of the visitor. Would she now make this little sally of inspectionP&#xD;
Yes; there was her shadow against the wall; then it disappeared with a hurried&#xD;
rustle of female vesture. At once it seemed certain to Lehming that Nettie-&#xD;
Fulton was Nestoria Bernard, and his heart fell to beating again with such&#xD;
violence that he had to pause .for another rest.&#xD;
"We seem to have disturbed some one," tranquilly observed Wetherel,&#xD;
whose unconsciousness of the real nature of this scene is surely a striking fea-&#xD;
ture of it.&#xD;
"One of my fellow-lodgers, probably," panted Lehming, as he slowly re-&#xD;
sumed his ascent. When he entered the reading-room his usually dark and&#xD;
sallow face was so ashy that his companion was alarmed by it.&#xD;
"Lie down on your sofa," said Wetherel with a sort of dictatorial kindness,&#xD;
quite natural to him. "These piles of stairways are too much for you. You&#xD;
must positively give up this nonsense of refusing advances out of the estate,&#xD;
and take enough to put you in comfortable lodgings. A man with a heart&#xD;
disease mustn't have his bedroom on the top of St. Simeon's pillar."&#xD;
Lehming thought to himself that, if Edward knew who was near, he also&#xD;
might turn pale. Then his mind glanced to Nestoria, hidden away  in her own&#xD;
room, doubtless in extreme terror,- perhaps fainting. But he kept his lips&#xD;
sealed upon the mystery; the time had not come for revelations.&#xD;
"Don't disturb yourself about me," he muttered. "Take a seat and tell&#xD;
me the news."&#xD;
Wetherel related the story of his southern expedition: how he had searched&#xD;
New Orleans for the murderer of his uncle; how he had searched, and found&#xD;
not. Lehming listened, to him as one listens to a hum of conversation in an-&#xD;
other apartment, the sound of which is audible, but the words indistingtiish-&#xD;
able. His mind was filled, to the almost complete exclusion of other ideas,&#xD;
by a constant reiteration of two tremendous queries. Was this girl, who had&#xD;
just'fied from Edward's presence, Nestoria Bernard? And, if so, what unen-&#xD;
durable emotion, what terrible secret, had driven her to evade her betrothed&#xD;
lover? She might be the murderer; but no, that was impossible. She might&#xD;
know that Wetherel was the murderer; but no, that also could not be accepted.&#xD;
Tossed and whirled by these scaring suspicions and desperate denials, no'won-&#xD;
der that Lehming listened without hearing.&#xD;
But there was another auditor, who was even far more agitated than he,&#xD;
.and who could scarcely be said to draw the breath of the living. - It must be&#xD;
explained that, when Nestoria looked over the stairway rail and saw her&#xD;
former lover, she lost her self-possession and fled, as thoroughly frightened and&#xD;
,bewildered people do, without considering whither. Instead of rushing to&#xD;
her own room, she had leaped back through the open door of the study, and&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                       '137&#xD;
then, driven on by the noise of advancing feet, had taken refuge ,in a closet.&#xD;
The closet was large and nearly 'empty; it contained nothing but a timeworn&#xD;
chair which had been set aside by some bygone lodger; but this chair saved&#xD;
the girl from falling, and so from discovery.&#xD;
Dropping into it, she at first leaned back against the wall; but presently it&#xD;
seemed to her that the wild. beating of her heart would surely be audible&#xD;
through the partition; and bending forward, she rested her arms upon her&#xD;
knees, with her head drooping. In this posture, and absolutely without stir-&#xD;
ring a muscle, she sat through the whole interview. Is it not easy to imagine&#xD;
the whirling tumult of struggling thoughts and emotions which filled the girl's&#xD;
brain and heart while she listened to Edward's voice and, heard his storyP&#xD;
Was it true that he had been seeking for the murderer? What could it inean?&#xD;
Was he innocent? Or was this search only a piece'of monstrous and desper-&#xD;
ate hypocrisy ? How could she disbelieve in his guilt? With her own eyes&#xD;
she had seen him strike the .blow. And yet he had the assured tone of one&#xD;
Whose soul is laden by no crime, There were moments when she was upon&#xD;
the point of rushing into the room and throwing her arms around his neck, or&#xD;
rather falling at his feet. Then the bloody scene in Judge Wetherel's study&#xD;
rose before her, and she shrank within herself at the thought of touching such&#xD;
a criminal.&#xD;
Still, she could not denounce him;.somehow he was yet too sweet and.&#xD;
beautiful to be brought to public scorn and to punishment; she felt that, even&#xD;
if she should face him with that intent, her tongue would be palsied. So she&#xD;
sat quiet, and listened; she answered and disputed him without being heard;&#xD;
she took such part in the dialogue as a ghost might. 'Indeed,.it seemed to her&#xD;
at times as if she were really dead, and only present there as a helpless,&#xD;
speechless, and utterly wretched spirit. Thep there was an impression of an-&#xD;
other ghost, the spectre of the murdered Judge Wetherel, crouching in the&#xD;
darkness beside her and hearkening to the discourse without. She almost felt&#xD;
this terrible visitant, and yet she did not stir a finger's breadth. She was&#xD;
tempted to scream aloud, and she withstood the scared urgency. Only an im-&#xD;
agination made potent by lifelong familiarity with spiritualized beliefs could&#xD;
have inflicted such suffering. Only a character of singular firmness and self-&#xD;
eommand could have endured-such an ordeal.&#xD;
But we must return to the audible and visible participants in this extra-&#xD;
oidinary scene. By the time.that Wetherel had finished the narrative of his&#xD;
adventures in New Orleans Lehming had recovered his power of attention.'&#xD;
"And so you learned nothing," he said. "The supposed trace was a de-&#xD;
lusion of the police."&#xD;
"I merely wasted my time," replied Edward. "Of course that is no mat-&#xD;
ter. It is my duty to give my life to this mystery so long as thei'e is a gTeam&#xD;
of hope that it can be cleared up. To sit down quietly would be to confess&#xD;
myself a villain and to be one. How can I draw an easy breath until I have&#xD;
taken this noose of guilt and peril from around my own neck and put it where&#xD;
it belongs? You don't know how horrible I find it to be pointed at in the&#xD;
streets. The other day a boy called out, ' There he is.' He meant some one&#xD;
else, but I thought he referred to me, and I stopped as if a policeman had col-&#xD;
lared me. I am sometimes weak enough and babyish enough to declare that&#xD;
there ne ver~ was any torture like mines"&#xD;
" How many innocent ones, since the foundation of the world, have suffered&#xD;
likewise!" sighed Lehming. "It perplexes and pains one's spirit to think of&#xD;
&#xD;

A&#xD;
&#xD;

the mass of calumniation and undeserved sorrow that has been borne in all,&#xD;
the ages. We suffer for each other's misdeeds as often as for our own."&#xD;
"There was one Innocent who suffered for all the guilty," said Wetherel.&#xD;
"But for the remembrance of that, I think that I might have been driven to&#xD;
suicide."&#xD;
At hearing these words Nestoria scarcely restrained herself from coming&#xD;
out of her hiding-place and laying her hand on his shoulder.&#xD;
",I deserve it all," continued Edward. "My life has been such that men&#xD;
might well suspect me of crime."'&#xD;
To Nestoria this sounded like a confession of blood-guiltiness,'and of course&#xD;
like a very incomplete and inadequate confession, showing no profound and&#xD;
salvatory repentance. To Lehming, on the contrary, it seemed the exagger-&#xD;
ation of a. scrupulous soul, looking upon the ordinary excesses of youth as&#xD;
enormo s misdeeds. Thus variously do we judge our fellow creatures, acord-&#xD;
ing to our differing lights and points of view.&#xD;
" We must not deal over-harshly with ourselves," said Lehming. "Do&#xD;
you remember how John Bunyan looked back upon his Christmas bell-ring-&#xD;
ings as deadly sins, and marvelled that Heaven had not visited him with in-&#xD;
stant judgment in the midst of them? It was undoubtedly an extravagance&#xD;
of self-condemnation. You should be careful to avoid such excesses of aus-&#xD;
terity. The Divine Reason is perfectly reasonable."&#xD;
"I shall keep watch of myself," observed Wetherel, after a pause.&#xD;
" Thanks to my good health, my mind is mainly even in its pulse. I believe&#xD;
that I do not habitually overestimate my responsibilities and culpabilities.&#xD;
Repentance is just, but remorse is folly. I trust that I perceive the distinc-&#xD;
lion between the two."&#xD;
Notwithstanding the gravity of Leming's own spirit, he could not help mar-&#xD;
velling at the gravity of his comrade. Here was a young man, who two&#xD;
months before had seemed destined to be a worldling for life, but whose char-&#xD;
acter had now become solemnized, and, if we may use the timeworn phrase,&#xD;
spiritualized. He was still the same in person and face, tall and strong and&#xD;
upright, with fresh blonde cheeks and brave blue eyes and an air of hardy&#xD;
virility. But, in soul he was another; he was the historical Wetherel; he was&#xD;
the Puritan.&#xD;
"You had to break off your medical studies," resumed Lehming, anxious&#xD;
to render the conversation more lightsome and to brighten his young friend's&#xD;
mood.&#xD;
'I shall go on with the course," replied Edward. ".I am resolved to be a&#xD;
physician. It seems to me the profession in which I can make myself most&#xD;
useful to my kind. A doctor can be a philanthropist without impertinence&#xD;
and as a natural part of his vocation. If he can do nothing better, he can&#xD;
gripe and nauseate poor people gratis," he added, with a faint flash of that hu-&#xD;
mor which belonged to him as a Wetherel, though in him it had of late been,&#xD;
much in abeyance.&#xD;
Once more Nestoria was almost uplifted and borne into his presence by a-&#xD;
throb of sympathy, of forgiveness, and of love. The mere word doctor was a&#xD;
claim upon her affection because it had been the title of her father.&#xD;
At this mpment there were steps in the passage, and Miss Jones appeared&#xD;
at the door of the study. .&#xD;
" I quite beg your pardon, Mr. Lehming," she said in that stilted tone&#xD;
which she was apt to use before strangers. "But I intrude~ upon you to ask&#xD;
if you have seen anything of my little friend."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.           ,            139&#xD;
"Is she out?" asked Lehming with a start of alarm. "How could she go&#xD;
out alone at this hour?"&#xD;
"It is even so," mouthed Imogen Eleonore. "I have searched for her in&#xD;
rain. She must have fled into the dark, dark night."&#xD;
All at once it occurred to Lehming that Nettie Fulton might have taken&#xD;
refuge in his closet; and with equal rapidity it flashed across him that in such&#xD;
case she must be Nestoria Bernard. No other supposition could account for&#xD;
the confusion and fright which must have been necessary to precipitate hez&#xD;
into such a hiding-place.&#xD;
What should he do? Should he open the door, drag the girl into the pres-&#xD;
ence of Wetherel, and force a solution of this fearful riddle ? -&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
WILL SHE FLY?&#xD;
"I CANNOT repress the anxiety which fills me soul," murmured Imogen&#xD;
Eleonore, who was obviously elocutioneering at the soul of Edward Wetherel.&#xD;
Lehming felt that this young lady was oppressive; .it certainly would not&#xD;
do to open the closet door in her presence; he was nervously anxious to get&#xD;
rid of her.&#xD;
"Is it not possible.that y ur friend has taken a walk with Mr. Bowlder?"&#xD;
he suggested.&#xD;
Imogen had advanced into the room with the deep and dark intent of&#xD;
getting herself introduced to the handsome and -handsomely attired young vis-&#xD;
itor; but as Lehming did not present her, she was obliged in decency to come&#xD;
to a halt and to devise some "thrilling " speech, under cover of which she&#xD;
might ,beat a retreat.&#xD;
"Your weird supposition is worthy of hopeful consideration," she said with&#xD;
the even utterance of an automaton, and thereupon swept-as she would have&#xD;
described it-out of the room, considerably irritated against Mr. Lehming.&#xD;
" You have annoyed your friend, I am afraid, on my account," gently re-&#xD;
marked Wetherel-a changed and bettered young man certainly, for time was&#xD;
when lie would have been hardheartedly amused at the discomfiture of this&#xD;
intrusive young lady, and would have made satirical remarks on hel obvious&#xD;
craving after male company.&#xD;
"She is a good-hearted, well-meaning girl," replied Lehming. "I must&#xD;
say in excuse for her that I have made her welcome to this room and what&#xD;
there is in it. But she ought to have seen that we wished to be in private."&#xD;
He was a little less considerate than usual, because the mystery of the&#xD;
closet perplexed and agitated him almost unendurably. What would be the&#xD;
result if he should fling open that door and bring these two people face to face?&#xD;
Was one of them the murderer,j/and did the other know it? If he should re-&#xD;
veal Nestoria to Wetherel, it might give her an unsupportable shock; it seemed&#xD;
to him in his excitement that it might drive her mad, or kill her on the spot.&#xD;
In vain did he argue with himself that the mystery ought to be solved, and&#xD;
try to feel that it was his duty as a man and a Christian to hurry it to a solu-&#xD;
tion. le made such progress as travellers toward the polar sea have made&#xD;
when the ice-fields under their feet 'slipped southward faster .than they could&#xD;
toll northward. At th a end of a minute of tumultuous reflection his senti-&#xD;
ments had drifted him far back from the deed to which his conscience suni-&#xD;
&#xD;

140                 THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
moned him. It seemed to him as if untraversable spaces'had intruded be&#xD;
tween him and that closet door; as if he could not reach it though he should&#xD;
journey toward it all night.; as if it were in another planet.&#xD;
At last this sensitive and compassionate soul gave up the struggle to take&#xD;
hold upon a duty which a puissant imagination filled as full of perils and cruel-&#xD;
ties as the em brace of the deadly-" Virgin" of the Inquisition was full of knives.&#xD;
He resolved that he would not precipitate a revelation; that he would suffer&#xD;
the girl to escape from her doubtless agonizing concealment; that he would&#xD;
see her alone the next day, and plead with her for an explanation; that he&#xD;
must eveni run the risk of her flying during the night.&#xD;
"If you don't mind a little chilliness, we will go into my bedroom," he&#xD;
said to Wetherel. '"It will give my disappointed fellow-lodger a chance to&#xD;
come back here and get a book, if she wants one."&#xD;
"Certainly," replied Edward. "We can wear our overcoats. Besides, I&#xD;
shall not stay long. I must take a look at my text-books before I go to bed."&#xD;
The two young men quitted the study, and were soon closeted in the bed-&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"I wanted to speak to you about our cousin," continued Lehming, revert-&#xD;
ing to the subject which he had had in mind half an hour before. Then he told&#xD;
of the foreigner whom he had met at Mrs. Dinneford's, and hinted his fears that&#xD;
the man was wooing Alice with some chance of success. Wetherel had little&#xD;
to communicate concerning Poloski except that he was a gambler and was&#xD;
supposed to be-a fortune-hunter, and that he might or might not be a count.&#xD;
I am astonished that Alice should seem to care for hiM," he frowned in a&#xD;
rather imperial way, very natural to male Wetherels. "She has always&#xD;
known that I had 'no opinion of the fellow."&#xD;
"'Our girls are so easily carried away by a title!" said Lehming. "It is&#xD;
natural; a title is a general letter of introduction; it opens .the way to good&#xD;
society everywhere. And yet such a marriage as this would probably be a&#xD;
sad affair. American women are'hardly ever happy with foreign husbands;&#xD;
they get too little consideration and have to concede too much obedience.&#xD;
Moreover, this man may not be a noble; may be a vulgar and rascally im-&#xD;
postor."&#xD;
"I must see to this!" observed Edward with the air of one who could not&#xD;
help feeling himself to be the head of the faniily, however much he might&#xD;
strive after the grace of meekness. "I am somewhat responsible for the ac-&#xD;
quaintance."'&#xD;
"If we do nothing else all our lives, we shall have work enough in un-&#xD;
doing our mistakes and mischiefs," said Lehming, a man whose almost stain-&#xD;
less purity of conduct did not save him from the inquisitions of conscience'.&#xD;
Next there was some talk about Wetherel's plans for the future. It ap-&#xD;
peared that he intended to devote himself to the betterment of the industrial&#xD;
classes.&#xD;
",I shall practise, gratuitously in the main," he said. "I shall look up&#xD;
such patients as other physicians cannot afford to have. But that'is not all.&#xD;
Do you know that our artisans and workingien generally are running to&#xD;
their ruin, through ignorance of the elements of political economy' . Look at&#xD;
these strikes. The strikers don't know that the raising of wages involves the&#xD;
raising of expenses. ,What they need is not higher pay, but cheaper living.&#xD;
Our present system of taxation is a plundering of the poor. Our tariff seems&#xD;
to be specially designed to enhance the cost of the materials of labor and of&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        141&#xD;
the necessaries of life. It works ahiost exclusively for the benefit of a few&#xD;
hundred capitalists and monopolists, who are rich enough to overawe and per.&#xD;
naps to bribe our politicians. But you know all this; I won't tire you with it.&#xD;
What I propose is a course of lectures to workingmen on political economy&#xD;
and on household econoniy also. The laboring classes needall sorts of practi-&#xD;
cal instruction. They are absurdly and ruinously extravagant; their wives&#xD;
have silk dresses, and their babies velvet jackets. I find young fellows who earn&#xD;
twenty-five dollars a week and spend half of .in cigars, drinks, frolicking,&#xD;
militia displays, and other follies. They growl a capital-without seeing that&#xD;
they are ^themselves to blame for the fact that t ey are not capitalists. But&#xD;
the subject is too attractive; it is irritatingly inexhaustible. I become tire-&#xD;
some when I commence on it."&#xD;
"Will democracy destroy us?" sighed Lehming. "In- a democracy every&#xD;
citizen is tempted to want to be as fine and as much at leisure as any other&#xD;
citizen. And the women are madder than the men; their one demand is for&#xD;
idle elegance."&#xD;
"Our cultivated classes must put their shoulders to this loads" declared&#xD;
Wetherel, with the enthusiasm of youth. " Can't you give a lift? You know&#xD;
that abundant pecuniary means are at your command. By the way, when&#xD;
will you take your share of that estate? P&#xD;
" How long can the settlement be put off?" inquired Lehming.&#xD;
"A year from the decease."&#xD;
" Give me that time," smiled Walter, a pygmy who was fit to have the&#xD;
power of a giant, so little was he likely to abuse it. "I' know perfectly well&#xD;
that I am not an heir, and I don't want to be hustled into heirship. Of course&#xD;
you give the Dinnefords whatever you like, and they will probably submit,&#xD;
and ought to. They are women, and are used to being supported by others,&#xD;
and to have others decide for them/J But a man is responsible for his own&#xD;
moral code in matters of property. I must have time to consider this business&#xD;
of talking your money. Let us talk of it toward the end of the year.",&#xD;
"Very well," nodded Edward with a fine tranquillity, and took his departure.&#xD;
Lehming now returned to his study, looked with a beating heart into the&#xD;
closet, and found it empty. On the floor of it, however, he discovered a little&#xD;
silk neckerchief which he recognized as belonging to Nettie Fulton. There&#xD;
was of course no longer much doubt in his mind that the girl had been hiding&#xD;
there, and almost as little doubt that she was the refugee from the horror and&#xD;
mystery of Sea Lodge. After gazing at the neckerchief for a -moment, he&#xD;
wrapped it carefully and one might say reverentially in a piece of white paper,&#xD;
and put it in the breast pocket of his coat, very near his beating heart. Then&#xD;
he went softly to the door of Miss Jones's room, tapped gently, and, when the&#xD;
schoolma'am made her appearance, asked if Miss Fulton had returned.&#xD;
"Yes," answered Imogen Eleonore. "I went to inquire for her in the&#xD;
apartment below, and came back as quick as ever I could, and here she was.&#xD;
I should like you to tell me, sir, what I am to think of it," she added, with an&#xD;
air of laying all the responsibility on Lehming.&#xD;
But the young man had Ino desire to talk over the matter, and so he said'he&#xD;
was glad that Miss.Fulton had been found, and began to smile himself away.&#xD;
"I can't stand this much longer," Continued Miss Jones in a hissing whisper,&#xD;
much like the voice of a blown football suffering from a~ puncture. "I think&#xD;
you .ought to speak with her about her mysterious ways," r-ged this young&#xD;
Woman who was bursting with a long-endured colic of curiosity. "She's as&#xD;

THE WETIIEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
pale as a spectre of the gloomsome night, and she won't tell me where she has&#xD;
been."&#xD;
Lehming halted. "'Uall me, if she seems to be ill," he said energetically.&#xD;
Then, without further hearkening, he glided hastily away, whereupon Imogen&#xD;
slammed her door in a pet.&#xD;
The burdened Lehming returned to his study, and seated himself before his&#xD;
sniouldering fire. He was sorry that Miss Jones should be offended; but in a&#xD;
minute or so he had entirely forgotten her. He could think only of Nestoria-&#xD;
how to prevent her from taking flight, perhaps before morning, and how to&#xD;
draw her out of her doubtless wretched and possibly wrongful seclusion. le&#xD;
felt sure that never during her whole life could she have any real happiness,&#xD;
unless she revealed all that she knew (and she must know something) of the&#xD;
murder of Judge Wetherel.' He was persuaded that it was her duty to make&#xD;
such a revelation, even though it should fill her heart and other hearts with&#xD;
incurable sorrow. The supposition that she might herself be the assassin he&#xD;
rejected absolutely, notwithstanding that it was held by many people, and a&#xD;
reward had been offered for her apprehension. Then he had to grapple with&#xD;
the terrible hypothesis that, if she accused any person of blood-guiltiness, that&#xD;
person would probably be Edward Wetherel.&#xD;
"Well, so be it," he whispered, drooping his head to his knees and burying&#xD;
his face in his hand. "It is her duty to bring the wrong-doer to punishment,&#xD;
though she and all of us suffer grief and shame beyond estimate.. If blood be&#xD;
upon his soul, she must give him up, and we must all give him up. 0,&#xD;
Heaven! with this thought upon my mind, how could I face him as calmly as I&#xD;
did! 0, almighty and pitying Father, let it not be as we think! - Let that cup&#xD;
pass from us! But if it must come to our lips, give us strength to drink it!&#xD;
No, there must be no putting away of justice; there must be no evasion of right-&#xD;
eousness. She must speak, and I must make her."&#xD;
So he went on, fighting with suspicions and horrors, for hour after hour.&#xD;
We often hear of passing a night without sleep; it is an almost superhuman&#xD;
feat and seldom accomplished; but Lehming did it. His mental trouble alone&#xD;
might not have kept him waking, but he felt it his duty to watch against the&#xD;
flight of Nestoria.&#xD;
Wrapping himself in his overcoat, he moved his chair close to his partially&#xD;
open door, and listened for the sound of stealthy feet in the passage. If he found&#xD;
himself inclined to doze, he paced the room for a minute or two in his stockings,&#xD;
and then resumed his ward. The dull hum and murmur of the great city around&#xD;
him sank little by little into a perfect, solemn, and awful silence. From time&#xD;
to time a bell, which he remembered that he had never heard before, gave him&#xD;
notice of the death of the hours. This solitary sound, recurring after such&#xD;
weary intervals, and striking into the midst of tragic reflectoris and anxieties,&#xD;
seemed to him funereal. His powerful and sombre imagination awoke at the&#xD;
summnions, spread its raven wings, and flew abroad through the night, seeking&#xD;
out spectacles of sorrow  He heard in fancy all the bells that ring for the&#xD;
burial of men, extorting the fierce or despairing grief of mourners all over&#xD;
the world. He saw the black, slow corteges of those who cannot be comforted.&#xD;
The vast ocean of universal human misery rolled in upon and swelled his own&#xD;
wretchedness. It was such a night of sadness and boding as. only a most sen-&#xD;
sitive imagination can know.&#xD;
A little after two in the morning he started up from his seat with an i m-&#xD;
pressioni that footsteps were gliding through the hall toward the stairway&#xD;
&#xD;
142&#xD;
&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
Stepping out of his room as noiselessly as possible, he put forth one hand at a&#xD;
venture in the darkness, and caught a figure wrapped in a shawl or some&#xD;
other womanly vestment. There was a low cry, and an attempt at retreat ;&#xD;
but Lehming held firm with one trembling hand, while with the other he drew&#xD;
a match against the wall. As he expected he beheld the slight form and child-&#xD;
like face, row pale and terrified enough, of Nettie,&#xD;
"What do you stop me for?" she burst out in a harsh, eager, passionate&#xD;
whisper.&#xD;
"Come into my study and let me speak to you before you go," he replied.&#xD;
"My poor child, only one moment!"&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
PERSUASION AND EXPLANATION.&#xD;
T HE flickering aurole of the waxen match which Lehming held between&#xD;
himself and Nestoria lighted up two pale, quivering, anxious, iiploring&#xD;
faces.&#xD;
One of these countenances pleaded with all the eloquence of affection, of&#xD;
benevolence, and of conscious duty for one minute of speech and remonstrance.&#xD;
The other pleaded with the still more intense fervor of keen misery and terror&#xD;
for liberty to depart without a word into the unknown, into friendless flight,&#xD;
into lifelong hiding.&#xD;
They were much more than mere faces; they were souls encountering&#xD;
each other. Neither saw the other's physical features; eyes looked far deeper&#xD;
than the color and sparkle of eyes; they penetrated to the sufferings and long-&#xD;
ings within. It was a meeting of vast import; one of those meetings which&#xD;
must have more than earthly consequences; one of those meetings which&#xD;
are worthy of the interest of seraphs and demons. Here were' two beings&#xD;
gifted with immense power of desire and of suffering; two imaginations which&#xD;
were mighty enough to create heavens and hells; two consciences of almost&#xD;
superhuman range and sensibility. Here was a cherubic spirit on the verge&#xD;
of erring, and an archangelic spirit strivng to save.&#xD;
" The light has burned out," whispcaed Lehming, as he let the remains of&#xD;
the consumed match fall from his hand. "It seems to me as if we had met&#xD;
in the darkness which stretches beyond the grave. Can you not look upon&#xD;
your present purpose as you will look back upon it in your future existence? I&#xD;
have an idea that you are about taking 'a step which will be decisive of your&#xD;
character through all the hereafter. Can you not think it over again before&#xD;
you finally decide upon it? Meditate it. once more in my presence. I will&#xD;
not utter a word of advice or query unless you wish it.  I will neither&#xD;
help nor hinder by any act. All I want is that, before you depart, you shall&#xD;
be sure that departure is right."&#xD;
Nestoria, trembling from head to foot, did not answer; she appeared to&#xD;
have no niore life than sufficed to keep her from falling. Notwithstanding&#xD;
the complete darkness, she could still see Lehming as plainly as ever; and&#xD;
she could not withdraw the gaze of her soul from that sympathetic and benev-&#xD;
olent countenance. Sallow, irregular, and homely as it was, she had learned&#xD;
to look upon it with liking and veneration, because it was so obviously the&#xD;
index of a pure and compassionate spirit. And in this interview, under the&#xD;
brief light of a moment since, it had so shone with heavenly yearning and&#xD;
counsel, that it could' neither be forgotten nor repelled. It seemed to her,&#xD;
wandering as she was in a tempest of trouble, that she had met some hMly one&#xD;
walking upon the waters, able to stretch forth a victorious hand and save.&#xD;
Her conscience, her strong and spiritualized imagination, all the righteous&#xD;
influences of her earlier life, pressed her to lean toward this deliverer and ac&#xD;
&#xD;
THlE WETHEREL AFFAIR-              R145&#xD;
cept his help. She only needed a gentle and almost unfelt touch upon the&#xD;
arm to turn her back from the stairway by which she had ipeant to fly from&#xD;
all who had ever seen her.&#xD;
In a moment more they were in the study, and the door was closed against&#xD;
chance listeners. Lehming lighted his lamp, and saw that the girl was shiv-&#xD;
ering as with an ague; he stirred the embers which he had left purposely in&#xD;
his fireplace,.and roused a cheering blaze. For a little while they crouched&#xD;
over the flame, merely warming themselves in silence, for both were chilled&#xD;
with watching.  At last the young man raised his large head, and looked anx-&#xD;
iously into the face of his guest. He was touched almost to tears by her ex-&#xD;
pressiorn of unutterable perplexity, anxiety, ahd grief. Never before had he&#xD;
seen such an agonizing revolt of mighty e notons against a mighty conscience.&#xD;
" May I speak freely ?" he asked in a whisper.&#xD;
" Yes," gasped Nestoria, without, lifting her eyes from the faces and han-&#xD;
toms of another world which leered and grimaced at her from amid the char-&#xD;
ring coals.&#xD;
What I have to say will be hard to bear," he continued, dreading to in-&#xD;
flict further suffering.&#xD;
"I can lbear everything," replied the girl, remembering witi a shudder&#xD;
how much she had already borne.&#xD;
.Imust say then that I know you," he went on with difficulty. " You are&#xD;
Nestoria Bernard."&#xD;
Nestoria made no reply; she shuddered at hearing her own name, as if she&#xD;
dreaded and hated it; but she still clung as firmly as she could to her secret.&#xD;
"Here is your neckerchief, which I found in that closet," he said, produe.&#xD;
ing it.  I understand how you came there. You ran in to escape from'Ed&#xD;
ward Wtherel"&#xD;
Still Nestoria did not confess, or confessed only by silence.&#xD;
I wish you could see it to be your duty to reveal the cause of your flight&#xD;
from Sea Lodge," he murmured with a sense of choking, as if the hangman's&#xD;
noose were around his own neck.&#xD;
A minute passed without a word from either. Several times Nestoria's&#xD;
lips moved, but they gave forth no sound. Meantime the two continued to&#xD;
look at each other with indescribable fixity and eagerness.&#xD;
" Is there not a soul at stake in this matterP" he said at last.&#xD;
Yes-mne!" she answered, shaking her head desperately. "But I can.&#xD;
not save it. It must go."&#xD;
" Oh, ho!" he protested, fearful of driving her quite to despair. "We&#xD;
must make allowance for differences of judgment. You may he right in your&#xD;
reticence. Time will show."&#xD;
Then lie sank into a wretched silence; he feared that Edward was the&#xD;
murderer.&#xD;
"Ah, yes, I may be right!" Nestoria burst out, after a few moments of&#xD;
meditation. " There may be some.mystery, some incomprehensible delusion,&#xD;
in this horrible thing. Oh, there may be, there may be! Perhaps I ought to&#xD;
wait; perhaps it is my duty. 0 God of mercy, grant that it may be so, and&#xD;
that I may not die before I see it to be so!"&#xD;
"Can you tell me nothing?" asked Lehming. "!CaT you not give me a&#xD;
chance to judge your doubts? "&#xD;
She looked at him with a dazed expression which might have meant that'&#xD;
'ihe wanted to evade his question, or might have meant that she did not un-&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
derstand it. He decided that it was proper and necessary to speak with un-&#xD;
mistakable plainness-&#xD;
" Let me. lay the whole thing before you," he resumed. "You were in&#xD;
the house of Judge Wetherel on the night of his death. Before morning you&#xD;
had disappeared, and you have remained in hiding ever since. It is believed by&#xD;
some misled people that you struck the blow which ended the old nman's life! "&#xD;
He paused; but Nestoria did not answer, nor look up; she had evidently&#xD;
considered the probability of this suspicion against herself; it was already an&#xD;
idea so familiar that it did not surprise, nor even shock her.&#xD;
"It is believed by-others that you witnessed the tragedy, and that you&#xD;
were driven from the house by terror for yourself," continued Lehming.&#xD;
The girl remained impassible; she'did not dissent by either word or look;&#xD;
but he'guessed that this was not the true statement of the case.&#xD;
"Others believe," he persisted, "that you recognized the murderer, and&#xD;
that you fled in order to avoid bearing witness against him."&#xD;
He stopped breathless. All his manhood, strength of mind, and sense of&#xD;
duty had scarcely sufficed to enable him to make this terrible declaration. He&#xD;
had feared,,and at the san e time had fully expected, that she would be over-&#xD;
com e. by it.&#xD;
He was disappointed. Nestoria did not utter a sound, and did not so much&#xD;
as move. The volume of moral force which lay In this small, youthful, and&#xD;
seemingly fragile creature was prodigious. She had long been prepared to&#xD;
meet such a trial as this in some form or other, and now that it had come she&#xD;
endured it with a composure which was almost more than human. Not a&#xD;
vast intellect, not capable perhaps of a many-sided development, not gifted to&#xD;
express even what was in her in any remarkable fashion, she had a depth of&#xD;
feeling and a singleness of purpose and a tenacity of will which fitted her to&#xD;
endure heroically. Fice to face with a man, who unveiled the horrible secret-&#xD;
of her life, and charged her with what she wretchedly- felt to be her great&#xD;
crime, she made no avowal either by word or glance. As she had resolved to&#xD;
be silent and impassible if ever she should be brought before a court of justice,&#xD;
"so she was silent and impassible now. And the wonder of this moral-or im-&#xD;
moral-achievement was that she accomplished it in despite of a sense of guilt&#xD;
from which her very soul revolted. The greatest and saddest feature of her&#xD;
victory was that it was a victory of sentiment over conscience.&#xD;
"Have you nothing to tell me? " inquired, Lehming, after long waiting.&#xD;
Still Nestoria did not respond; she was meditating, and she would not&#xD;
- speak until she had thought her thoughts clean out; not until she had surveyed&#xD;
all the consequences which might follow on utterance.&#xD;
"I had hoped to be able to counsel you," Lehming presently added. "I&#xD;
find that I can only counsel myself."&#xD;
"To surrender me?" she asked sharply. " You as good as'promised not,&#xD;
to do that. I understood you so when I came in here."&#xD;
" I will not surrender you," he said. " But, ought you not to surrender&#xD;
yourself?"&#xD;
Wait!" replied Nestoria.&#xD;
This single word was the result of her long and laborious and miserable&#xD;
deliberation. It was uttered most impressively, with a tone of finality, and&#xD;
with a look of unalterable decision.&#xD;
" Please to tell me more fully what you mean," he begged, meanwhile&#xD;
gazing at her with wonder. a&#xD;

&#xD;
"Oh, how hard it is to explain!" she groaned. "I want time. I am ot&#xD;
yet satisfied. I still doubt what my eyes told me. I cannot doubt, andet&#xD;
I must. Some day I may tell, but not now. I must have more time, more&#xD;
time, I can't say how much. But I will stay here ; that is--will you keep my&#xD;
secret tIf you will keep my secret, I will stay. Otherwise I will go at Once.&#xD;
I know that you can't keep me-thitsyou' won't try to hold me. But if you&#xD;
ill p promise me your silence, I will stay. I want to stay. I can trust you;&#xD;
I can trust your word, and your wisdom, and your heart; you are the only&#xD;
person in the world whom  I can trust fully. Now if you will give me&#xD;
your word not to expose me, I will give you my word to remain here until-&#xD;
until .  Ah, nov I dare not pledge myself," she added, shaking her head.&#xD;
Some other discovery, some other  meeting, might drive me away in a mo-&#xD;
mentree cand pl aed msL."&#xD;
aInterested and agitated as Lehning was, he noted her forethoughtedness&#xD;
and her respect for truth with amazement, and said to himself that a girl who&#xD;
in such circumstances could retain so clear a mind and scrupulous a conscience&#xD;
deserved confidence.&#xD;
"Do you know who I am? " he asked.&#xD;
"You are Alice's cousin," she answered. "I remember hearing her speak&#xD;
of you. She only called you Cousin Walter. I did not recognize you un-&#xD;
til -"nil               -&#xD;

hrsentence.p                                                     b&#xD;
Nestoria nodded slightly. She could not be induced to mention the name&#xD;
ot Evard Wetherel, nor to allude to him, in any distinct fashion, for fear,&#xD;
doubtless, that if she once began: to speak of him, she might say too-much.&#xD;
"Mrs. Dineford and Alice love you dearly," Leliming went on. "They&#xD;
are full of anxiety about you. Will you let me tell them where you areP&#xD;
Can't you trust them                                          a&#xD;
Nfestoria's heart yearned for these two friends; but she said to herself that,&#xD;
ifashe cae ewn t cthem, she might meet Edward; and she felt that that&#xD;
was an interview which she could not endure. In response to Lehming's&#xD;
question she covered her face with her hands and shook her head violently.&#xD;
Then we two must keep this secret alone," he said sorrowfully. "I will&#xD;
proise-it is a tremendous thing to do, and I fear a wicked one-but I will&#xD;
promise not to reveal who you are until you give me leave to do so, unless in-&#xD;
deed I am suddenly driven to call in others to save you from urgent danger.&#xD;
I do this not because I approve of your decision, but to save you from flying&#xD;
into lifelong hiding, remorse,-misery, and perhaps into eternal ruin. I do it&#xD;
in the hope that you will yet be led to see your duty, and to perform it, how-&#xD;
ever terrible it may be. I also hope that, if we wait a while, we may discover&#xD;
soetig bter than you believe. If I am wrong, God forgive me!"&#xD;
shn silence and with an air of profound abstraction Nestoria rose, threw her&#xD;
shawl over her arm, picked up her little travelling-bag, and moved toward&#xD;

148                 THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
She passed out; she was as noiseless as a shadow; he listened in vain for&#xD;
a sound which should indicate whither she had gone; after a while he extin-&#xD;
guished his lamp, stepped into the dark hall, and went to his bedroom.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
A SORE CONSCIENCE AND TENDER HEART.&#xD;
LEHITNG went to his room not-alone, for a train of perplexities and anxie-&#xD;
ties followed him, and, as we have already said, he did not sleep.&#xD;
He had such a sense of guilt that it seemed to him as if he had never done&#xD;
wickedness before, although during his pure life a scrupulous conscience had&#xD;
wounded him with many arrows.&#xD;
"Particeps criminis!" he repeated to himself a hundred times. "I an&#xD;
aiding and abetting in the concealment of a murderer. I am helping to hide.&#xD;
one who has shed the blood of his father's brother; the assassin of an old man&#xD;
as venerable for goodness as for years."&#xD;
"Is it possible P " he queried as often. " Have I not misuiiderstood this&#xD;
poor, confused child? Has she not misunderstood events?  What are the&#xD;
grounds of her conviction? Eyesiglit? She can hardly mean less;, nothing&#xD;
less would have driven her from her betrothed lover;- she is too true in heart&#xD;
to be moved by less."'&#xD;
"I cannot believe such a monstrous thing," he declared over and over&#xD;
again. "Edward never was-evil enough to commit a crime. He had in those&#xD;
days no conscience toward God, but he had a conscience toward man. le&#xD;
would break divine laws but not human laws. There are thousands and thou-&#xD;
sands of such cases.. There are infidels and atheists whose lives are stainless,&#xD;
honorable, beautiful. We who believe cannot comprehend it, but we are com-&#xD;
pelled to admit it. Edward was honorable; he was a gentleman; he could&#xD;
not murder."&#xD;
There were moments during which he tried to persuade himself that Nesto-&#xD;
ria was insane. "But-no," he decided; "I cannot believe it any more than&#xD;
I can hope it; a clearer, steadier intellect never cane face to face with mine.&#xD;
Madness could get no hold on such physical and mental health as hers. In all&#xD;
the sorrow and terror which must have tormented her she has;not even hag a&#xD;
brain fever. Looking at such a constitution as that, I must concede her entire&#xD;
sanity."'&#xD;
" Ah! there is some error," he frequently insisted, or rather pleaded.&#xD;
"Some day events will force the real murderer to light, and compel him to&#xD;
say to Edward, You are innocent! Some day the mists of this mystery will&#xD;
blow away,'and we shall behold the actual fact of crime, hideous enough, but&#xD;
endurable. Denunciation now might be calamitous and horrible falsehood.&#xD;
Nestoria is right; we must wait. There is no peril to justice in waiting.&#xD;
Edward will not fly; not even though he be guilty; least of all if he be&#xD;
guilty."&#xD;
"Wait!" was' his final conclusion. He started from it and returned to it&#xD;
many times; he was like a bird tied by the leg who flutters uselessly; it was&#xD;
in vain that his conscience and his reason strove to tear him away; his prom-&#xD;
iso and his wishes both bound him to that word, Wait..&#xD;
In these struggles the darkness of latter night and the grayness of early&#xD;
-norning flitted by. lie was accustomed to rise at sunrise, breakfast on a roll'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                          149&#xD;
and a cup of coffee which he made for himself, and go over the lessons which&#xD;
he would have to hear during the day, coaching up in them as carefully as if&#xD;
he were pupil instead of teacher. This morning he was tempted to lie a while&#xD;
later; his head reeled and his whole feeble body ached with the fever of sleep-&#xD;
lessness; but, with that martyr-like spirit whlich formed a large part of his&#xD;
character,'he resisted the temptation.&#xD;
It was a trial to him to approach his mirror and face its pitiless candor. Hc&#xD;
knew that he should be uglier than usual; that he should find himself little&#xD;
less than repulsive. He was not one of those plain people who can create at4&#xD;
illusion about their own plainness, discovering in it some redeeming feature,&#xD;
which makes amends for surrounding imperfections, and drawing therefrom a&#xD;
comfortable sense ofself-admiration. From the earliest days of childhood that&#xD;
lie could remember, lie had been keenly conscious of his utter lack of comeli-&#xD;
ness; and-the response of looking-glasses, that benediction of simple joy to so&#xD;
many, had always been to him a message of wretched humiliation. With&#xD;
beautiful meekness and self-control lie had fought with this aversion to a keen&#xD;
spiritual pain, and forced himself into long contemplation of his ugliness.&#xD;
Every day he made it a point to stand for a minute or so before his mirror, sur-&#xD;
veying his misshapen head, his irregular features, and his yellow complexion,&#xD;
and saying to himself with self-loathing, but with submission, "Thus it has&#xD;
pleased God to make me."&#xD;
This morning the trial was doubly hard to bear. Never before had he been&#xD;
so desirous of appearing so far agreeable to himself as to give him a hope of&#xD;
becoming agreeable to some fellow creature. Nestoria, with her childlike and&#xD;
touching beauty, her immense sorrows, and her sweet endurance, had dazzled&#xD;
his: intellect and won his heart. He believed that she would never return to&#xD;
the man whom she had loved, and that some day, in pure loneliness and grief,&#xD;
she would intrust herself to some other protector. To be that other Lehming&#xD;
was willing to sacrifice whatever other good there might be for him in life,&#xD;
and to complete the gift, if need be, with his death. Yet lie knew that the&#xD;
moment he came face to face with his mirror, he should see himself to be to-&#xD;
tally unworthy of the affectionate regard of any woman.&#xD;
Ie approached the cruel truth-teller with as much repugnance as if it were&#xD;
a mortal foe, ready to plung, a dagger into his breast. He looked into it; he&#xD;
beheld his long, coarse face, 94ualid with trouble and want of rest; he suffered&#xD;
under the spectacle, but he did not flinch front it. To this remorseless Moloch&#xD;
he dragged all his delicate, throbbing hopes, and sacrificed them as the Tlyri-&#xD;
anis sacrificed their little ones. He did not turn away until.it seeided to him&#xD;
that the inhuman offering had been completed.&#xD;
"I must live for others," he said as he left the mirror. "No one but a dog&#xD;
would ever live for me. If I had a little less reason and faith than I have, I&#xD;
should say that the Redeemer could not have died for me, so insignificant and&#xD;
despicable do I seem to myself."&#xD;
An hour later, after lie had prepared his lessons, lie heard the step of Inio-&#xD;
gen Eleonore in the passage, joined her, and inquired after Nettie.: To his&#xD;
great relief for up to this moment lie did not know that the girl had 'not fled)&#xD;
he learned that she was in her room asleep. In his place another iian might&#xD;
have been annoyed becauseshe could slumber while he had waked through&#xD;
both night arid dawn, on her account. Lehming lelt only pleasure and hvon-&#xD;
der, as if over a beneficent miracle.&#xD;
" What health !" he marvelledl to himself. " What health of mind and&#xD;

&#xD;
body! - Lesser troubles and perils than hers have sent men into sleepless ner-&#xD;
vousness, ending in insanity. What is not such an organization capable of ?"&#xD;
That day he gave out to his scholars as the subject for English composition,&#xD;
"Health."  ,.&#xD;
" Health of body and of mind," he lectured with enthusiasm. " Without it&#xD;
we can do little or nothing. From health we get that calmness and that endu-&#xD;
rance in labor which make labor effective. At twenty-two the young Cond6&#xD;
slept until the opening guns of his first battle. From the tranquil and restora-&#xD;
tive slumber of health he was awakened with difficulty to win the decisive vic-&#xD;
tory of Rocroi. Nature, or rather the Allfather whio is- nature, had planned&#xD;
Him for vast toil and great deeds. If you wish to accomplish much, you must&#xD;
establish health as a starting-post. It is to the man of genius what the earth&#xD;
was to Antinus; if he cannot touch it in his falls, he falls never to rise again.&#xD;
Without it there can hardly be any splendid productiveness or large useful-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
All that day he saw nothing of Nestoria, and knew of her only that she had&#xD;
not fled. In the evening he went to his study, laid out the unfinished manu-&#xD;
script of a story (for boys), and tried to write. But the chariots 4 fancy drave&#xD;
heavily, and he could not get through a single sentence. He opened a book;&#xD;
of course it was a masterpiece of one of his favorite great authors; he wanted&#xD;
a strong and noble stimulus for liis flagging spirit. But the pages of Haw-&#xD;
thorne were as dull ai41 cold to him as were the pages which lay before him in&#xD;
his own handwriting. 'A night without rest, followed by a day of anxiety and&#xD;
wearing inward debates, had utterly jaded both body and mind. Gradually his&#xD;
long, unshapely chin drooped to his prominent breast- bones, and he sank into&#xD;
the hard, horny gripe of the sleep of utter exhaustion.&#xD;
Roused after a time by the consciousness of some presence, he became&#xD;
aware that Nestoria was sitting by his fire and gazing upon his face, mean-&#xD;
while warming her little hands with a kitten-like grace and tranquillity. She&#xD;
greeted his awakening with one of her peculiar smiles, a smile which was full&#xD;
of sweetness as well as of plaintiveness, reminding him of sunshine beaming&#xD;
through the curtains of rain.&#xD;
"I am glad you have slept," she said in a soothing tone, as if she were a&#xD;
nurse and he her patient. "I am afraid that my troubles kept you awake last&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"Your voice is like an .Eolian harp," he answered dreamily. "It sings&#xD;
because of storms, or in spite of them."&#xD;
There was no reply, except that her smile became a thought more sad,&#xD;
while retaining all its sweetness.&#xD;
"I am greatly obliged to you for not going away," he presently continued,&#xD;
recovering his waking senses, "You promised to remain, but it was a promise&#xD;
hard to keep. I hope and, believe that you will not be. suffered to repent of it."&#xD;
"I stayed to copfide in you," she said. "You are so good and sympathetic&#xD;
that I cannot help trusting you, and leaning upon you. Now that my father&#xD;
and Judge Wetherel are gone, it seems to me that you must be the best man in&#xD;
the world. I cannot make ulpi my mind to leave you  I must have at least&#xD;
one comforter in all this wretched earthly wilderness. It is dangerous to stay;&#xD;
but I cannot, cannot go-at least not yet."&#xD;
"You force me to do what you wish," he responded, after surveying her'&#xD;
for some time in great perplexity of spul. "I still believe that I ought to urge&#xD;
you to go before the authorities at once, and tell all you know- I still feel that&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
151&#xD;
&#xD;
it ismy duty to demand that step of you. But I am unable to demand it. I&#xD;
must let you judge this tremendous matter for yourself. You-must have the,&#xD;
time for deliberation that you require. We will wait."&#xD;
" We must!" she decreed with quiet firmness, and seemingly without con-&#xD;
sidering difficulties or adverse arguments, just as a child says, " I must have&#xD;
the moon."&#xD;
On this basis they continued their life. Lehming had hoped to gain, little&#xD;
by little, such an influence, over the girl as would enable him to persuade her&#xD;
into' discharging her conscience of the load which oppressed it, and into clear-&#xD;
ing up the mystery which had thus far balked the inquisitions of justice, But&#xD;
instead 'of his mind encroaching upon hers, it was hers which day by day&#xD;
.gained empire over his. The moral force which springs from feeling was in&#xD;
this case too mighty for themoral force which springs from conscience. The&#xD;
woman's instinctive resoluteness defeated the man's superior reason.&#xD;
He was almost carried away by her. He began to think of accepting his&#xD;
portion, or at least some portion of the Wetherel estate, and devoting it to her&#xD;
service. Would he.be justified, he occasionally asked himself, in transporting&#xD;
her to a foreign land, where she might be safe from the houndings of law,and&#xD;
pass ter days without terror? As yet he had not the presumption to query&#xD;
whether it might not be right for him to unite her blighted life to his own&#xD;
blighted life. 'He bowed down.to her in secret; he~ silently gave her all that&#xD;
exuberance of affection in his nature which no one 'had cared to reap; in one&#xD;
plain word, lie loved her. But he was too humble, too keenly aware of what&#xD;
lie considered his repulsive imperfections, to approach the idea of marrying&#xD;
her otherwise than slowly and unconsciously.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
A RATIONAL AND A WHXAiSICAL COMFORTER.&#xD;
NESTORIA had now more peace of mind than had been hers since her flight&#xD;
from the scene of the murder.'&#xD;
She had, as it seemed to her, made a confidant of Lehming; 'and every in-&#xD;
fant knows the comfort that there is in telling one's trouble. In actual fact she&#xD;
nad barely hinted to him the solution of this horrible Wetherel problem, so&#xD;
that a soul less sympathetic and clever than his might have altogether misap-&#xD;
prehended her. But so clear and obvious to her mind was the whole labyrinth&#xD;
of crime, that it appeared to her as if her few vague words had pointed out&#xD;
every bloody footstep which tracked its obscure intersections. At times, in-&#xD;
deed, she said to herself that she had divulged far too much, and was angry at&#xD;
her weakness and terrified at her imprudence. But, on the whole, her over-&#xD;
flow of confidence, and the sense of sympathy obtained, soothed her. Her eyes&#xD;
began to beam their natural sunshine, and there was less plaintiveness and be-&#xD;
seeching for pity' in her smile, while her conversation sparkled now and then&#xD;
with the intrinsic lightsomeness of youth.&#xD;
" How strangely we get used to things! " 'she one evening said to Lehming&#xD;
"Once I would not have thought it possible that I should see the weeks which&#xD;
I have seen, and yet preserve sanity and life. But here I am; I still have my&#xD;
treason and draw my breath; indeed, it sometimes appears to me that I am not&#xD;
even changed. I have just been reading a description of the siege of Port&#xD;
Hudson, telling how accustomed the artillerymen became to the bombard-&#xD;

ment, and how they slept alongside of the roaring gunis, The noise and the&#xD;
danger were ordinary circumstances to them. It is just so with nie. I am usu-&#xD;
ally as calm as I was in the days of innocence and safety. It seems like a stu-&#xD;
por; and yet I am not stupefied; I am merely tranquil. It is a terrible mys-&#xD;
tery. , One feels like saying that the human soul is capable of too much. It is&#xD;
capable of living quietly in sin and sorrow, as well as in holiness and prosper.&#xD;
ity. Are we right in pitying the poor and ignorant on the ground that they&#xD;
are wretched? Perhaps they are as contented as the rich and wise. We&#xD;
should pity them mainly for being thus contented with curses instead of long-&#xD;
ing and striving after blessings. I understand now the lives of criminals. I&#xD;
used to suppose that they were constantly tormented by remorse and terror.&#xD;
The sad knowledge has come to me that it is not so. They are generally easy,&#xD;
in their minds. They are like me. Perhaps I have suffered more with re-&#xD;
morse than any brutal murderer now living. And yet I bear it; my hand does&#xD;
not tremble when I paint; I hit the right colors without effort; I paint better&#xD;
every day-better and more. easily. One might suppose that there was no&#xD;
curse upon me for duty unfulfilled."&#xD;
"Few can endure like you," sighed Lehming, who was often'"impatient of&#xD;
the physical feebleness which he found in himself. "You are a marvel of&#xD;
health. Under your load I should be crushed. Even the trifle of it which you&#xD;
have given me to carry, seems at times nearly too much for me."&#xD;
"I am sorry for it," she said humbly. "I ought to have gone away with-&#xD;
out a word. 'I have been weak and selfish."&#xD;
Lehming looked at her with wonder and almost with reverence. Ie said&#xD;
to himself that-he had never known in one so young such elevation of senti-&#xD;
ment and keenness of reflection. Had he seen her while she WAs at Sea Lodge,&#xD;
and so been able to estimate the great advance which she had made since that&#xD;
time in both moral and intellectual force, he would have been still more aston-&#xD;
ished. The bearing of constant peril and vast sorrow had developed this late-&#xD;
ly girlish spirit surprisingly and with surprising rapidity.&#xD;
"Don't mind about having laden me," said the deformed young.man. "If&#xD;
I cannot live a little for others,. I count myself nothing worth. I only regret&#xD;
that you cannot see your way clear to do your instant duty, however painful it&#xD;
may be."&#xD;
"Ah! don't talk of that!" implored Nestoria, drooping her sunny head.&#xD;
"Not yet! Wait!"&#xD;
"Do you know that Edward Wetherel proved an alibi  " he continued,&#xD;
venturing boldly upon the subject which he believed to be her torment. " He&#xD;
proved that he was in New Haven on the night of the murder."&#xD;
"Did he?" exclaimed Nestoria, her face-turning crimson. "Oh, did he?"&#xD;
"I heard the testimony," replied Lehming, trembling with the eagerness&#xD;
of hope. "The witnesses were wild fellows, but at the time I did not doubt&#xD;
them."&#xD;
For a minute or so the girl remained silent. She was studying over and&#xD;
over the picture which her memory presented of the assassination, and striving&#xD;
to eliminate from it the form and features of Edward Wetherel. The task was&#xD;
impossible; the figure reappeared as fast as she rubbed it out; it had a cruel, a'&#xD;
ghoulish tenacity of existence. The flush of joy in her cheeks faded tinder its&#xD;
battenings to a plaintive pallor. Lehming's sensitive spirit divined from this&#xD;
charge in her countenance that she knew of something which.would not let&#xD;
her give lasting credit to his cheering tale. The subject became hateful toe&#xD;
him, and he wrenched himself away from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE WETHEREL AFFAIR.,&#xD;
&#xD;
153&#xD;
&#xD;
"I wish we had some enlivening amusement for you," he said. "I should&#xD;
like-if it were not too mad a wish-to take you to see a comedy."&#xD;
She glanced at him with surprise, and replied, "I thought the theatre was&#xD;
very wicked."&#xD;
"It is a /matter of regret that so many good people have thought so," ob..&#xD;
served Lehming. "The Church lost a strong grip on humanity when it de-&#xD;
nounced. the drama and gave it over into the hands of the irreligious. Men&#xD;
need relaxation, and will have it. Devout minds should have recognized the&#xD;
fact, and should have provided pure public amusements, theatrical and others.&#xD;
A Christiaiiized theatre would be a means of teaching, capable of reaching ears&#xD;
that will not hearken to the pulpit."&#xD;
"I can understand that it might be so," nodded Nestoria, after due reflec-&#xD;
tion, such as she habitually gave 'to a new idea before accepting it. '" I should&#xD;
like to see something amusing. . I should like," she added, the corners of her&#xD;
mouth trembling piteously, "to laugh once more."&#xD;
At this moment they heard a singular sound in the hall. It was a shuffling&#xD;
and thumping, as of some one dancing, and dancing, too, with all his might,&#xD;
like King David in his linen ephods Then the door opened, and the bushy,&#xD;
grizzled hair and beard, and the rosy face of John Bowlder appeared, aciom-&#xD;
panied of course by th it philosopher's bulky and cumbrous figure. He looked&#xD;
bigger than ever, for he was clad in a flowered calico dressing-gown, which&#xD;
was voluminous enough to wrap up a middle-sized steeple comfortably, and&#xD;
which bagged and swung in all directions to get asway from its wearer. He&#xD;
was dancing; there could be no doubt of the capering fact; lie was performing&#xD;
some kind of an untaught, unteachable, unexampled jig; such a.jig as was&#xD;
never produced to hdman eyes before, and without supernatural assistance&#xD;
never-will, be again. A colt let loose in a meadow, or a calf welcoming its&#xD;
mother home from pasture, never accomplished such unbroken plungings and&#xD;
kickings and cuttings. Meantime-a philosopher through it all-he had the&#xD;
rapt air of a whirling Dervish. His haystack of a head was thrown back in&#xD;
a kind of ecstasy, and a childlike, simple smile played about the corners of his&#xD;
wide mouth. Take his expression and his action together, and lie .was the&#xD;
maddest hmmn spectacle imaginable. If Lehming and Nestoria had not been&#xD;
familiar with his oddities, they would have judged him stark crazy, and set&#xD;
about tying him.&#xD;
"I am frisky to-night," he - gasped breathlessly, as he curvete. around the&#xD;
room. "We must obey our whims, as well as our solemn intuitions, if we&#xD;
would be real men.' Great and beautiful,Wand partakers of the divine essence,&#xD;
are the untraninielled children of nature. It is our rational duty to do what we&#xD;
want to do, like Robert Burns and George Gordon Byron-like kittens and in-&#xD;
fants. If you desire to hop on one leg,,let your desire have instant and unpre-&#xD;
meditated outcome, defying the promenaders and the police. Skip, hop, and&#xD;
jump in Broadway, if.Broadway seems your arena. Only do not hop through&#xD;
taking thought thereto, out of bravado or vain pomp. Let your hopping be&#xD;
.he fruit of simplicity and honesty, or it is no'acceptable hopping, but rather.&#xD;
dishonoring."&#xD;
Here he caine in conflict with a chair, upsetting it and falling across it.&#xD;
Nestoria burst into a hearty, natural laugh, the first laugh that Lehniing had&#xD;
ever heard from her, her nly laugh since the night of the murder.&#xD;
Unabashed by his calamity, John Bowvlder picked himself up, briskly set&#xD;
the chair on its clattering, noisy legs,. placed himself astraddle of it,, and com-.&#xD;
nmeiiced singing some of his owyn verses:&#xD;
&#xD;

154                  THE WETHEREL' AFFAIR.&#xD;
"All nature hath its clamorous joys ;&#xD;
The hiding crickets make sharp noise,&#xD;
The fireman yawps, the rooster crows,&#xD;
The ploughman loudly blows his nose.&#xD;
" Sing out, bawl out, the godlike glee.&#xD;
Wherewith great Pan lhath dowered thee,&#xD;
Which rings through Neptune's stormy reel&#xD;
And in the porker's festive squeal.&#xD;
"Let Bralun and Buddha swell the song,&#xD;
Let Dagon thunder it along,&#xD;
Let Woden shout his savage arune,&#xD;
And Bowider answer with his tune.'&#xD;
"Do you call it a tune, Mr. Bowlder?'" asked Nestoria, as soon as she.could&#xD;
speak. "It seems as-though it must be something else."&#xD;
Her face had a gleam   of that shrewd, infantile humor which those who&#xD;
knew her months before had sometimes seen upon it. Lehming, to whom the&#xD;
expression was a revelation, gazed upon it with wonder and pleasure. He be-&#xD;
held in it the renewed hope and exhilaration of a  soul which, after long wan-&#xD;
dering in utterly blinding darkness, finds its way into a more supportable&#xD;
gloom, and walks on with reviving confidence and cheerfulness.&#xD;
"Yes, I venture to call that yawp a tune, Miss Nettie," gayly replied the&#xD;
philosopher. "It is the tune the old cow died of. It is Bowlder's tune, the&#xD;
only one he knows, and kno n to no other cosmos. The man who feels that&#xD;
he is called to sing cannot wa t to learn music. If he is a true 'man, he will&#xD;
sing what be can, though the jackass keep him company. Supjpose Robert&#xD;
Burns had refused to write poetry until he could write it in pure English or 'i&#xD;
Latin.  We should not have had his great, boyish, demigod glee.    There&#xD;
would have been no "Tam o' Shanter' for us, now nor forevermore. No Burns&#xD;
am I; no Tam o' Shanter have I to cheer the world with; so much I know of&#xD;
myself. But what I have that give I freely, like a bird, or a running spring.&#xD;
or a pumpkin pie."&#xD;
This last figure struck him as a particularly good one. It was natural, it&#xD;
was drawn from common life, like the similes of Socrates and Emerson. It&#xD;
inspired hini to improvise some more of his extraordinary poetry, singing it to&#xD;
his invariable melody, which went equally well with all meters:&#xD;
"Life a pumpkin pie-&#xD;
Is this essor named I,&#xD;
Free to every eater,&#xD;
Would it were sweeter i&#xD;
But such as it is, the gods mixed It,&#xD;
And what there is of it, the universal forces fixed it;&#xD;
*     And although it is thin and plain,&#xD;
You may cut and conic again.&#xD;
" The old; cow that died of-the tune may now die again of the verses," he&#xD;
commented with exterior modesty, while yet he could not help glancing about&#xD;
him in some faint hope of a compliment.&#xD;
Nestoria smiled. The first burst of resuscitated gayety was spent, and had&#xD;
not strength enough left to uplift her to a laugh. It seemed to her, neverthe-&#xD;
less, that she was wildly merry.&#xD;
"I shall grow fat again if I go on laughing at this rate," she said.'&#xD;
" Let me urge yiu to laugh whenever you can," counselled Lehming,.&#xD;
"Some of us have too few chances for light-hieartedness. We must let none&#xD;
slip'&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.,                       155&#xD;
" He means himself as well as me," thought Nestoria, glancing compas-&#xD;
sionately at his deformed figure and plaintive face. "I must give him what&#xD;
sympathy and comfort I can."&#xD;
CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
INQUISITIONS AND ADMONITIONS.&#xD;
Now and then it seems as if the shallow materialists, who call themselves&#xD;
Spiritualists because they have revived fetishism and the superstition of savages,&#xD;
might yet be right in this one affirmation of theirs, that soul mnay communli-&#xD;
cate with soul through some medium other than the ordinary senses.&#xD;
What man so stolid and so isolated fromhis kind in heart, but that he has&#xD;
at times felt that some woman, who merely sat or stood near him, uttering no&#xD;
word and making no sign and sending him no glance, was yet kindly and&#xD;
warmly interested in him ? An inaudible and invisible messenger has brought&#xD;
the tale, thrilling the delicate aspens of the affections with glad thankfulness,&#xD;
and perhaps even arousing the potent echoes of the blood.&#xD;
Nestoria granted to Lehming a silent throb of sympathy, and he knew it.&#xD;
It was a delicious moment: for a brief, happy while he forgot his ugliness; it&#xD;
appeared to him that he was worthy of loving, perhaps of being loved. A&#xD;
few tickings of the cheap wooden clock on his grimy mantelpiece measured&#xD;
out to him more of ecstasy than he had known in his whole life before. Then,*&#xD;
little by little, the splendid glamour of extravagant 'hope faded, and his reason&#xD;
looked abroad once more upon its accustomed spectacle of a loveless life. He&#xD;
said to himself that'it was folly to sit there gazing at Nestoria's fresh young&#xD;
beauty, and building for her and himself cloud-castles which could nevt r be&#xD;
come realities. He would quit her at once, and seek sanity in the streets. It&#xD;
would be a wholesome self-sacrifice, honorable to his soul and of gooid augury&#xD;
for his future.&#xD;
'I shall leave you two to amuse each other," he said, rising and putting on&#xD;
his Lilliputian overcoat. 'i"I have an errand or two to attend to before bed-&#xD;
time."&#xD;
-  What A man does, that he has," replied John Bowlder, quoting from his&#xD;
demigod Emerson. "Nevertheless, as I care not for having, I give myself&#xD;
little to doing. I want no ownership in errands. I can subsist without such&#xD;
property. We do not spend half time enough in looking lazily into our own&#xD;
hearts, as a boy stares at the crumblings and askings of the coals. Let me tall&#xD;
you, Walter, that your life is too busy. You would be a greater 'soul if you&#xD;
did less worldly work. You are over-useful, to your fellow creatures. And&#xD;
Edward Wetherel is taking the same thoi-ny road and travelling in the same&#xD;
barren circle. I met him to-day. The Briareus had all his spiritual arms full&#xD;
of projects. It would take an Argus to see all the trouble he is going to make&#xD;
for himself and others. le wants to cure the sickly, who ought to die; wants&#xD;
to feed the lazy and stupid, who ought to starve; wants to turn good day la&#xD;
borers into poor philosophers; wants to do an infinite deal of mischief."&#xD;
Lehming could not help glancing at Nestoria. At the name of Edward she&#xD;
had suddenly leaned forward, and she was now looking steadily into the blaze&#xD;
of the fire, her face hidden between her hands. He trusted that she believed&#xD;
somewhat to the young man's advantage, but he could not be sure.&#xD;
" I think our cousin does well," lie observed aloud. "So far as is visible&#xD;
to man , he is leading a noble life. I hope that you will not be permitted to&#xD;
turn himn from the way lie has taken."&#xD;
&#xD;

156                 THE WETIEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"Nothing will turn him," said John Bowlder. " He is a chip of the old&#xD;
gnarled Puritan oak. He is a Wetherel."&#xD;
As Lehming moved toward the door he met Imogen'Eleonore entering.&#xD;
"sAh! is it pos-si-ble? " drawled the schoolma'ani,'glancing significantly&#xD;
from. Walter to Nestoria, and putting into her tone more of the mustard of sa-&#xD;
tire than was absolutely necessary to give a taste to her words, as people of&#xD;
light brains and incomplete cultivation'are apt to do when spiteful. " Can&#xD;
Mr. Leliming persuade himself to leave such delightful company ?"&#xD;
Within the last week or two Imogen Eleonore had undergone a change of&#xD;
heart, or at least of behavior, for the worse. When she first extended her&#xD;
gracious beams to the so-called Nettie Fulton, she had expected that that .mys-&#xD;
terious young person would revolve around herself, and add to the glory of&#xD;
the Jonesian system. In such a case she would have continued to shine upon&#xD;
the girl with all the heat and splendor of her melodramatic affection. But&#xD;
things had gone otherwise; the little protgde had become the planet; the&#xD;
subli me patron had dwindled into the satellite.&#xD;
Not only Mr. John Bowlder, who was a very queer stick anyhow, but also'&#xD;
Mr. Walter Lehming; who had formerly been Miss Jones's particular friend&#xD;
(as she supposed), had fallen down bewitched before this small stranger, both&#xD;
being ready to wear their legs to stumps with running on her errands, and to&#xD;
talk to her by the hour for the wages of .her rare and brief answers. It was&#xD;
certainly most irrational conduct, and a just mind did well to be angry at it.&#xD;
What was there in Nettie to admire but a pretty face, golden hair, a mystery&#xD;
of some perhaps undesirable sort, and a certain odd, unexpected cleverness,&#xD;
which after all was only occasional? Imogen Eleonore could see nothing&#xD;
more; and in herself she could see a great deal more., She was "intellect-&#xD;
ed," as she phrased it, and a remarkable " conversationist," as she persisted&#xD;
it spelling it. - Her mind was richly stored with matters both useful and sen-&#xD;
tiuental; she could discourse of grammar and geography and arithmetic and&#xD;
history and astronomy; and as for the prose and poetry of the " New York-&#xD;
Spasmodic," who could outquote herP&#xD;
Yet here were these two men " a-going on " about this little Nettie! And&#xD;
Mr. Lehining especially! a man whom she had supposed to be " talented! " a&#xD;
man who heldthe lofty position of " instructor! "Hewasbowing down to&#xD;
that chit; yes, he was actually " sitting up" with her. How ridiculous, partic-&#xD;
ularly in a dwarf! Miss Jones was, in her own vigorous phrase, "real mad&#xD;
. about it; " she could not put up with such silly " carryings-on; " she was real&#xD;
mnad, and she didn't care who knew it. Even the dignity and puissance of a&#xD;
male Instructor could not prevent her from showing her grittiness. in look,&#xD;
tone, and speech.&#xD;
But if she expected to sneer a retort out of Lehming, or to daunt him into&#xD;
uttering some sidelong apology for his absurd preferences, she was disap-&#xD;
pointed. -He divined the poor schoolma'am's bitterness of heart and pitied her&#xD;
for it.1&#xD;
"tWalk in, Miss Jones," he said with his gentlest smile. " Walk in, and&#xD;
join our friends, and pardon me for leaving you."&#xD;
With these words he went his way; and we shall do best to follow him.&#xD;
He had not met Edward Wetherel since the evening when Nestoria's hints, or&#xD;
rather her silence, had seemed to clothe him in the garb of murder. He had&#xD;
not been able to muster the courage and the hardness to look him in the face.&#xD;
Now he was going to see him; to cross-examine his countenance and de-&#xD;
meanor; to judge, if it were possible, whether he were guilty or not. He&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         157&#xD;
found the youthful millionaire, lately one of the most ostentatious of prodigals,&#xD;
living in a single plainly-furnished room, which served both as parlor and&#xD;
bedroom. The meeting between the pair was in one. respect very remark-&#xD;
able. The inquisitor's eye wandered and his voice faltered, while the sup-&#xD;
posed culprit was as calm and brave as innocence ever is.&#xD;
You are economical," said Lehming, seating himself in a hard, well-&#xD;
worn chair, and glancing about the somewhat dingy  chamber.&#xD;
"I have wasted money enough in, my time," replied Edward. His man-&#xD;
ner in making this confession was admirable; it had none of that conceit with&#xD;
which reformed spendthrifts are apt to speak of their bygone extravagances;&#xD;
it expressed honest regret and-self-reproach.&#xD;
"A man in your situation is exposed to two great temptations," continued&#xD;
Lehming. "Wealth is beckoned to by lavish pleasure on one side, and by&#xD;
avarice on the other."&#xD;
"I am shielded from both for the present," said Wetherel. -"I Consider&#xD;
myself the trustee of this estate, and not the owner. But even if I were&#xD;
really rich, I hope that I should not be a fool. My ideas of what is fine in&#xD;
life have changed. Of course the .pendulum  may swing back; I may be-&#xD;
come what I have been; but I trust not."&#xD;
It seemed so. cleat that he meant even more than he said-there was such&#xD;
testimony of a profound renovation of character in his very calmness of utter-&#xD;
mee and demeanor-that Lehming turned upon his devils of suspicions, and&#xD;
past them out.&#xD;
"I do not wish you to be an ascetic," he observed with the frank kindness&#xD;
of friendship. " All extremes of conduct verge on irrationality. The extremist&#xD;
does evil as well as good. Calvin purified the church, but his preachings&#xD;
were top violent,'and there has been a harmful reaction against them. Your&#xD;
well-meaning and pure-hearted uncle was .in his way a Calvin. He did you&#xD;
little good while he lived."&#xD;
"It was hard to do good to such a jackanapes as I was," said Wetherol.&#xD;
" Do you know that a few months ago I was a prodigious ass? It is enough&#xD;
to make one both laugh and cry to think of it. When I was actually in a state&#xD;
of insolvency, I bought myself a .two-hundred-dollar dressing-gown. I was&#xD;
such an amazing jackanapes that I thought it a fine thing to wear a velvet and&#xD;
brocade dressing-gown. I received my friends in it when they came to lend&#xD;
me money to pay.my board bills."&#xD;
Lehming smiled, for he believed in his relative's innocence of crime, and&#xD;
the credence made him light-hearted.&#xD;
"I used to attribute your profuseness to the influence of Wolverton," he&#xD;
remarked.&#xD;
"Wolverton was not a model," assented Wetherel. "But I never knew&#xD;
him to be quite so bereft of common sense as myself. There was some judg-&#xD;
ment in the man, and it helped him to some morality."&#xD;
Here, by one of those coincidences which seem so frequent and so striking&#xD;
to the imagination, the person who was the subject of conversation made his&#xD;
appearance. There was a rap, and before Wetherel could fairly say, "Come&#xD;
in," Wolverton entered.&#xD;
" Unceremonious," he observed in his easy, assured, pleasant way. "But&#xD;
I have something which I ,consider devilish important to lay before you two&#xD;
gentlemen," he went on .with an earnestness unusual in him, he being com-&#xD;
monly a talker of the elegantly languid type. " Came to-see Wetherel about&#xD;
it, but glad to find you' both here. Don't you care anything about your rela-&#xD;

158                  THE WETIIEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
tive, Miss Dinneford? I do; not that I have the honor to know her nmuch,&#xD;
but I hate to see a nice girl in danger of coming to grief-that is, when she's&#xD;
connected with a friend of mine," he added, quite unconscious of the horrible&#xD;
cynicism of his qualification. "And come to grief she certainly will, if .she&#xD;
marries that d-d Poloski. I've found out something about the man more&#xD;
than we knew, Wetherel. I fell in with a detective, a low sort of blockhead&#xD;
named Sweet, who waited to, pump me about the-the Wetherel aflair, you&#xD;
know. Well, Sweet casually mentioned Poloski, and as I hate Poloski I asked&#xD;
what he knew of him, and he- told me a doose of a story. He says the noble&#xD;
foreigner is certainly an adventurer-well, we supposed as much, I take it---&#xD;
that's not new, But he went on to say that he gets his living in all sorts of&#xD;
queer ways-not only by poker, as we are experimentally aware, but by other&#xD;
means less-genteel. That is, so Sweet thinks, and thinks he can prove. lie&#xD;
has his eye on him; has traced him after midnight to Riley's saloon; horrid&#xD;
bad place, if you know it. Of course Poloski might claim that he was there&#xD;
to study character and-idioms. But Sweet followed him in, and found that lie&#xD;
had gone up stairs alone with Riley, and also that he had the name of courting&#xD;
Riley's daughter-pretty little wild girl, Sweet said. The fellovws there chaffed&#xD;
her about the Count, and she bridled and giggled and all that sort of thing.&#xD;
That was about all the man had to tell me. But don't you see that tie thing&#xD;
looks dark? Of course I hate Poloski; he issomething of a rival of mine in&#xD;
two or three places; I hate him a little, and despise him more, and so forth.&#xD;
But prejudice aside, I claim that his case looks dark. And in my opinion--&#xD;
begging your pardon for interfering in a family matter-you two fellows ought&#xD;
to look after him. Just imagine this girl-excuse me, I mean Miss Dinne-&#xD;
ford-jast imagine her married to Poloski. The next thing you would hear&#xD;
would be that she was abandoned, perhaps in Europe or the Lord knows&#xD;
where, and coming to grief all by herself. Don't you think so yourself now,&#xD;
Wetherel?"&#xD;
Edwvard's only reply was to rise from his chair with a mien of indignant&#xD;
excitement, such as the defunct Judge Wetherel might have worn in the&#xD;
sterner agitations of his youth, and such as we might perhaps fairly impute to&#xD;
many previous Wetherels. Wolverton rose also, and walked to the door.&#xD;
"Don't let me detain you," lie added as he went out. " The quicker you&#xD;
put your oar in, the better. He might pop any day, and put things beyond&#xD;
curing."&#xD;
In a minute more-Wetherei. and Lehming were on their way toward the&#xD;
Dinneford house.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
PEDANTIC LOVE-MAKING.&#xD;
How came it about that' such a grotesque and dubious adventurer as Po-&#xD;
loskishould win, to a certain extent at least, the confidence of such a sensible&#xD;
mother in Israel as Mrs. Dinneford, and the liking of such a flirtish daughter&#xD;
of Zion as Alice?&#xD;
It was probably the title of Count which mainly did the business for these&#xD;
two ladies, as well as for a number of other ladies then breathing the air of&#xD;
freedom in this glorious republic, the land of democratic simplicity and equal-&#xD;
ity. After our best society had decided to concede 'and eventually to affirm&#xD;
that Poloski was an entirely authentic rnoble, his success as a man of fashion&#xD;
and as a beau was assured. Even to the minds of free men and free women&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         159&#xD;
there is something powerfully and we will not say irrationally dazzling in the&#xD;
fact of descent from " a hundred earls," or even from a much shorter string of&#xD;
titled forefathers. As we look upon a "scion of a noble stock," we get an im-&#xD;
pression of the virtues and potencies and great deeds of successive eminent&#xD;
generations, all accumulated and concentrated in the perhaps personally un-&#xD;
attractive individual before us, and shining out of him like the vitality of by-&#xD;
gone forests out of a lump of anthracite. It seems natural and right to how&#xD;
down to a Lama whose lamaic predecessors have mayhap looked upon -the&#xD;
crouchings of our predecessors. We are' good republicans in our heads; we&#xD;
can argue against caste in the abstract, and do not want its hands in our&#xD;
pockets; but our imaginations are enchanted by it.&#xD;
So Count Poloski was a favorite in stylish New York society; a dozen, or&#xD;
perhaps twenty, or perhaps forty of our young ladies were more or less be-&#xD;
witched about him; and Alice Dinneford had not been able to resist the wide-&#xD;
spread infection. Satirical, clever, and in some respects sensible, she was in&#xD;
many things the abject slave of public opinion, and she wanted to carry off e&#xD;
this prize which so many others strove for.. And, what is much more wonder-&#xD;
ful, her mother had come to grant the Pole a certain degree of regard. The&#xD;
fact that "Freedom  shrieked when Kosciusko fell"~pleaded eloquently for&#xD;
lim to Mrs. Dinneford's excellent heart. Likewise it advantaged .him much&#xD;
with her that he was such a "scholarly man," and knew so much, or so little,&#xD;
of so many languages, and could talk fluently of so many diverse, abstruse&#xD;
subjects.  An, intellectual charlatan, whose hasty cleverness had washed&#xD;
through numerous channels and brought away some golden or at least shin-&#xD;
ing sands, was naturally impressive to, a semi-educated spirit which had the&#xD;
Nev England reverence for learning and looked upon every college tutor as a&#xD;
precious well-spring of knowledge.&#xD;
And when Mrs. Dinneford found that Poloski could discourse copiously&#xD;
concerning the Scriptures, she became disposed to consider him an elect soul,&#xD;
who might properly be received into any of the households of our American&#xD;
Zion. His views of Jewish history, indeed, rather amazed her; he discussed&#xD;
that revered subject with an absence of prejudice which at times seemed to&#xD;
her to border on free-thinking; but the fact that a foreigner, and especially a&#xD;
noble foreigner, should know anything at all about the Bible was delightful;&#xD;
and on the whole she listened to the Count's doubts ahd queries with a patience&#xD;
not devoid of respect and admiration. This very evening, while Edward&#xD;
Wetherel and Lehming were coming' to dislodge Poloski from her confidence,&#xD;
_ she held with him earnest speech concerning the influence of the captivity in&#xD;
purifying and elevating the Hebrew religion.&#xD;
The family scene was a pleasant one to look at. The tall, blonde, hand.&#xD;
some, dandified Poloski talked from the sofa, or rose in moments of inspira-&#xD;
tion to pace once or twice across the room, gesturing meanwhile with taking&#xD;
vivacity. Mrs. Dinneford hearkened from her rocking-chair, her plain but&#xD;
kindly and bright face beaming with interest, and her large, strongly-veined&#xD;
hands busy upon some charitable needlework. Alice, curled up prettily on a&#xD;
cushion, embroidered with a sort of tremulous vehemence quite characteristic&#xD;
of her when debarred froni talking.&#xD;
"In short, Mrs. Dinneford, the captivity founded Hebraism," summed up.&#xD;
the eneyclopedical Count. " The captivity was the starting-point of the&#xD;
Jewish national faith, as we know it. Up to the captivity the Hlebrews had&#xD;
no national faith. The school of the prophets, which was a patriotic sect, wor-&#xD;
shipped the Baal o1: Lord of Israel, who, as German scholars have discovered&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6242-00000081"/>&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
was a sun-god. The other Jews worshipped Moloch, who was the sun-god of&#xD;
the Tyrians, and the bacchic Baal, who was a sun-god of the northern Canaan.&#xD;
ites, and Ashtaroth, who was the moon-goddess of the Sidonians, and othei&#xD;
pantheonic deities. Their great king Solomon built temples to all the divini-&#xD;
ties of the surrounding peoples. The nation was polytheistic through 4dl its&#xD;
early history. It knew nothing of the great truth of monotheism. Superficial&#xD;
scholars, such as you have in England and America, have stigmatized the son&#xD;
of Nebat as an idolater. He was not; he was a reformer; he was a foe of&#xD;
polytheism. He set up the golden calf, or bull, as the symbol of the sun-god&#xD;
of Israel. He did away with other deities. He was the fonder of a national&#xD;
faith, purer far than the faith of Solomon. But his struggle to establish mono-&#xD;
theism was unsuccessful. Not until the captivity, not until the advent of the&#xD;
Persie idea of a divine unity, did the Jews become monotheists. , We owe&#xD;
Hebraic monotheism to the Persians, a race of the noble Aryan stock. That,&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford, is the true history of monotheism, at least so far as it concerns&#xD;
the Hebrews."-&#xD;
"These things are too hard for me, Mr. Poloski," replied the good lady,&#xD;
shaking her orthodox head resolutely, but with less acrimony than might have&#xD;
been expected. "I know that in the times of Elijah there were only seven&#xD;
thousand that had not bowed the knee to Baal and kissed him. But that was&#xD;
because Ahab and Jezebel had led the nation into apostasy. We have it in the&#xD;
Scriptures that the Jews were God's chosen people."&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Dinneford, all peoples are dod's chosen peoples," urged&#xD;
the Count. " He made them all; he chose to make them all; they are all his&#xD;
chosen peoples."&#xD;
" I must think of these matters," said Mrs. Dinneford, still shaking her&#xD;
head; "Another time, when I have meditated more fully on these weighty&#xD;
"questions,'I shall be glad to discuss them with you. I don't suppose that we&#xD;
shall settle them," she laughed goodl-humoredly. "As Tupper says, Shall&#xD;
time teach the lesson which eternity cannot master? I know that there are&#xD;
difficulties in Hebrew history. But my faith stands firm. With Tupper, again,&#xD;
I can declare, It is written, and so we believe, waiting not for outward proof.&#xD;
To be sure, he speaks there of the Trinity; but the same good rule applies to&#xD;
other mysteries; whatever is written I accept."&#xD;
The Count bowed, lifted his shoulders slightly, and fell silent. Perhaps he&#xD;
saw that it was useless to argue with this believing lady; perhaps he feared&#xD;
that he had already argued too boldly for his own good. Conceited as he was,&#xD;
and fond beyond measure of the sound of his own voice, he had nevertheless&#xD;
some worldly wisdom of self-control, and he did not want to win the ill opin-&#xD;
ion of Alice's mother.&#xD;
By the way, how is it possible, in view of the theories which Poloski had&#xD;
advanced, that Mrs. Dinneford had not set him down as an outright infidel,&#xD;
and resolved to eschew his, company? Well, 'in. the first place, he was a&#xD;
Count; and that was a fact which still confounded her greatly; she did -not&#xD;
quite know what a Count ought to believe. In the second place, she was&#xD;
largely broad-church in her sentiments; orthodox as she was for herself, she&#xD;
was very charitable to the views of others; and if a man admitted the exist-&#xD;
ence of a Creator, she strove to be content with him. In the third place-and&#xD;
this was the most bewildering fact of all-Poloski admired Alice. .In a person&#xD;
who beheld good in her child, this affectionate mother could find little evil.&#xD;
" I doubt not you will convict me when we talk again, Mrs. Dinneford,"&#xD;
bowed and smiled the Count. " In fact, we differ little in our opinions at&#xD;
&#xD;
bottom. All my ancestors have been Christians, and have derived their faith&#xD;
from the Hebrews.- I could not turn my back upon the belief of my ancestors."&#xD;
"It is a great blessing to come of a devout family," observed Mrs. Dinne-&#xD;
ford, who trusted that she had derived some good from her Wetllerel descent.&#xD;
"1Virtue and credence are hereditary,". pursued the Count. " That is one&#xD;
argument in favor of the belief in a special chosen people."&#xD;
'"You are a philosopher, Mr. Poloski," said the lady, quite cheered and&#xD;
gratified by this suggestion. "I do so reverence a philosophical mind, even&#xD;
when led away by too much trusting to its own strength, as is the case, I fear,&#xD;
with our great Emerson.' You remind me of my cousin, John Bowlder, who&#xD;
is an Emersonian, or tries his best to be."&#xD;
"Bowlder!" grimaced Poloski, not much pleased with the comparison.&#xD;
"You must pardon me for saying what I think of Bowlder. He is an idea-&#xD;
logue without a system. I have no confidence in idealogues who have no sys-&#xD;
tem, but say everything they can think of, burly hourly "&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford burst .into a hearty laugh; her sense of humor was easily&#xD;
tickled.&#xD;
"Cousin John is tangled," she admitted. " His talk is much like throwing&#xD;
things out of a window in a fire, grappling first whatever conies handiest, and&#xD;
tumbling everything iri one pile. To listen to him is just about the same as&#xD;
reading a dictionary: Deuteronomy, and deviltry, and duty, and dishwater&#xD;
come in the same column. But Cousin Joln, notwithstanding nis queer mix-&#xD;
tures, and his "poor, futile free-thinking, has such goodness of heart-- "&#xD;
" Oh, I love goodness of heart," hastily interjected Poloski, fearing lest he&#xD;
had been too hard upon Cousin Bowlder. "Goodness of heart makes amends&#xD;
for everything," he added, kissing his fingers and waving them heavenward.&#xD;
Alice cri::ged under this absurdly flat speech, and said to herself that now&#xD;
and then the Count was too silly, and for a moment marvelled over the fact&#xD;
that she had ceased to laugh at him. Then she reflected that he had improved&#xD;
of late; that, for one thing, he had dropped his ridiculous investigations into&#xD;
"slangs "; and finally that other girls as well as herself had learned to admire&#xD;
him. Nevertheless, she was anxious to give such a turn to the conversation&#xD;
as might prevent him from throwing any more kisses to goodness of heart.&#xD;
So she asked him (and a most insidious question it was) whether he intended&#xD;
to pass his life in America.&#xD;
"I must go to Poland this very winter," returned Poloski, with the start&#xD;
of a man who suddenly remembers urgent affairs.&#xD;
" Why so?" asked Alice, conscious of a sharp pang of interest. " You are&#xD;
not going to fire the Polish heart and make a revolution, I hope?" she added,&#xD;
trying to varnish over her anxiety with a joke.&#xD;
" I would if I could," declared the Count tragically. " But no; impossible.&#xD;
The Russian and German colossuses are too big and strong. The emancipa-&#xD;
tion of the serfs in Russia has thrown all:into confusion) in all Slavic countries.&#xD;
My steward knows not how to manage free tenants, and my revenues have&#xD;
diminished twenty thousand dollars, which," he added after a moment of com-&#xD;
lpuitation---" whichis almost half. I must go there and restore order. I must&#xD;
be my own Suwarbow. AJsteward cannot do it."&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford was delighted to see him take his loss of income so calmly,&#xD;
thinking that he had indeed inherited a heroic and worthy spirit from his noble&#xD;
ancestors.&#xD;
" I trust you will be gentle with your poor tenants, who of course don't&#xD;
know how to use their freedom aright the moment they get it, and must learn&#xD;

oy degrees how to perform their duties toward their employer, as well as to-&#xD;
ward themselves," she said with a simple good faith which might have drawn&#xD;
tears from an honestly tender philanthropist, but which only tempted Poloski&#xD;
to smile.&#xD;
"I shall be considerate to them, I assure you, my excellent Mrs. Dinne-&#xD;
ford," he promised with the gracious grandeur of an Ahasuerus extending his&#xD;
sceptre. " Here in America I have made advances in the sublime science of&#xD;
humanity."&#xD;
This speech was a lilt, for Mrs. Dinneford had been an abolitionist from&#xD;
her youth up, and had rejoiced exceedingly in emancipation and negro suf-&#xD;
frage, and sympathized with Mr. Sumner's desire to give every colored brother&#xD;
a farm and mule.&#xD;
Poloski saw that he had produced a good impression, and it occurred to&#xD;
him that he ought to improve it at once.. There was Miss Dinneford, a prize&#xD;
worth having. She was genteel, and she was handsome, and, what was more,&#xD;
she was rich, or would be. He must marry her; but to bring that about he&#xD;
must propose to her; and how should he propose? Would it be best to declare&#xD;
his love to the daughter after the American fashion, or preliminarily to the&#xD;
mother, after the fashion of Europe? Should he ask a private interview with&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford or with Alice? For a few seconds he was silent, gravely de'-&#xD;
bating these breathless questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
THE PLAIN DEALING OF TRUE FRIENDS.&#xD;
(OUNT POLOSKI had just decided that he would put his covetousness of&#xD;
Miss Dinneford's money into such affectionate and love-making English&#xD;
as he could command, and fire it off at both mother and daughter together, in&#xD;
the reasonable hope of bringing down at least one of them, when the door bell.&#xD;
checked him with its intrusive, unsympathetic tinkle, and in walked Edward&#xD;
Wetherel and Lehming.&#xD;
It will be remembered that they believed him to be a perilous adventurer,&#xD;
if not a vulgar ruffian, and that they came to exorcise him outof this house-&#xD;
hold. But there was no violence, and even no outright, candid explanation, so&#xD;
forbearing are the manners of American society, at least in the North, and so&#xD;
little pugnacious is its very hostility. Wetherel and Lehming were young men&#xD;
of the modern Puritan type, resolute and tenacious enough at heart, but out-&#xD;
wardly composed and mild. During the walk hitherward they had talked&#xD;
over their errand in a tranquil, business-like, considerate fashion, and had said&#xD;
that while the Count must if possible be got rid of, the feelings of the Dinne-&#xD;
fords must be handled delicately. So they bowed to Poloski, and took his hand&#xD;
when he put it forth in his vivacious, genial way, and otherwise treated him&#xD;
decorously. Of'course lie was exceedingly conciliatory to the relatives of.&#xD;
Alice; he addressed Edward as "My dear Wetherel," and called Lehming&#xD;
"Mon savant."&#xD;
"I did not see you the, other evening at the Van Leers," he remarked to&#xD;
Edward. " They gave a splendid soirde, the Van Leers. Mrs. Van Leer was&#xD;
very gracious to me; she always is gracious.. I admire Mrs. Van Leer, she is&#xD;
so gracious and spiritual. She is no longer quite young, but she is excessively&#xD;
'delicious, she is so gracious. I was very sorry not to-see you there, my dear&#xD;
Wetherel. I always miss you. And I missed .you, too, Mrs. Dinneford and&#xD;
Miss Dinneford. I had very little pleasure there, because I did not see any of&#xD;
you."&#xD;
" we were not invited," answered Mrs. Dinneford with self-respectful&#xD;
frankness, while Alice colored deeply, and barely refrained from biting her&#xD;
lips with vexation; for the Van Leers were what she called "awfully fashion-&#xD;
able," and the fact that they had overlooked her was mortifying. Lpt us re-&#xD;
member, by the way, $liat it was mainly because the Count "went every-&#xD;
where".that he seemed so desirable in her eyes. If she should become the&#xD;
Countess Poloski, she too would be able to "go everywhere," certainly in New&#xD;
York and probably in Europe.&#xD;
" Oh, I am sure there was an invitation, but it did not arrive," replied the&#xD;
ready Poloski. " The Van Leers have often spoken to me.of Mrs. and Miss&#xD;
Dinneford with distinguished consideration," he continued, romancing with ad-&#xD;
mirable volubility. " They must have invited you, they are so gracious.&#xD;
Did.you not receive your invitation, my dear wetherel?"&#xD;
"Yes," admitted Edward unwillingly, for he detected Alice's mortification,&#xD;
and was sorry to increase it by publishing his own superior fashionableness,&#xD;
"But I seldom go out of late. These crushes are uninteresting to me."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6242-00000083"/>&#xD;
1                   THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"You forget that Mr. Wetherel has suffered a bereavement lately," whis.&#xD;
pered Mrs. Dinneford to Poloski.&#xD;
" Ah-yes," murmued the Count with an air of extreme confusion, quite&#xD;
remarkable in such a veteran of society.&#xD;
He seemed to be painfully overwhelmed by his blunder, and sank into si-&#xD;
lence. Alice discerned his embarrassment, and was affectionately minded to&#xD;
come to his relief, and did so with all a woman's vivacity and fluency, giving&#xD;
forth corruscations of her thin, sparkling prattle. But somehow the noble for-&#xD;
eigner's, extinguished taper could not be relighted, and after grinning and&#xD;
bowing and saying "Oh yes " a few times, he took a flourishing departure.&#xD;
As soon as 'he had vanished, Alice became taciturn and moody. She had&#xD;
an impression that somehow her two relatives had driven the Count away, and&#xD;
she almost hated them for it. What young lady had he gone to see now, and&#xD;
what would he say to her, and what would she reply, and what would he say&#xD;
then, and what would be the result? were the important questions which per-&#xD;
turbed her soul and darkened heir brow. She did not seem the same girl that&#xD;
she had been during Poloski's visit. She was not merely speechless and so-&#xD;
ber; she had suddenly turned a little haggard and pale.&#xD;
"You appear to be unwell, Alice," observed Lehming, always promptly&#xD;
sympathetic.&#xD;
"I am not well," she said, rising in a state of uncontrollable nervousness,&#xD;
so that the tears almost came into her eyes. "I wish you two would excuse&#xD;
me for going to bed. I have a horrid headache. You can talk to mother, or&#xD;
rather you can listen to her," she added, forcing a gleam of her natural gaye-&#xD;
ty. "She will be so glad to get me off and have all the say to herself! Good-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"Good-night," answered the young men, gazing after her pitifully, for&#xD;
they were going to do a hard duty by her, and they were sensitive enough to&#xD;
know it.&#xD;
Alice gone, Edward took a seat by Mrs. Dinneford, and began: "My dear&#xD;
aunt, we have come to speak of this very man whom we found here, Mr. Po-&#xD;
loski."&#xD;
Then he told her, without alluding to Alice's supposed heart affairs, what&#xD;
Wolverton had reported to him of the Count's evil repute and suspicious ways.&#xD;
Before he had finished his story the good woman's eyes were full of anxiety.,&#xD;
"Oh dear!" she groaned. "What a world of snares and of pitfalls for the&#xD;
feet we live in! It is the Valley of the Shadow of Death. The slough is on&#xD;
the right hand and the black, miry ditch on the left, and devils roaming up and&#xD;
down the footway."&#xD;
"Until this man clears himself of these charges, and shows that he is a per-&#xD;
son of reputable life, lie is not fit to enter your house," continued Wetherel.&#xD;
"No," sighed Mrs. Dinneford, and came to a full stop there. She did not&#xD;
much doubt the tale; she was accustomed to rely upon the judgment of both&#xD;
Edward and Walter;   ey were not men to bring railing accusations against&#xD;
any one unadvisedly. flt what was she to do, or rather what would she be&#xD;
able to do, in this matter? Alice was a true woman; in an affair which-&#xD;
goncerned her sentiments, she was almost ungovernable; what she wanted&#xD;
with her heart, she wanted with all her mind and strength. Moreover, there&#xD;
had been little government in the family since the death of its male head.&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford had been like most American mothers, and like most mothers&#xD;
of only children everywherej; she was a good woman, conscientious and in-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         165&#xD;
telligent, but utterly incapable of holding strict rule 'over her offspring. If&#xD;
there had been any domestic lawgiving, any wielding of a family sceptre, it&#xD;
had been mainly on the part of Alice.  The affectionate mother actually&#xD;
cringed before the idea of a conflict with the petted daughter.&#xD;
" Mr. Wolverton himself is-is-" she presently stammered. "Are you&#xD;
sure that we can trust what he says?"&#xD;
"I know that Poloski is a gambler," replied Edward firmly. "In other&#xD;
times he has won hundreds of dollars from me."&#xD;
"The wages of sin! " shuddered Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
"Gambling alone is not enough to ostracize hiimi from society," continued&#xD;
the fair-minded young man. '" In Europe gentlemen and respectable people&#xD;
gamble; fathers and children win each other's francs or shillings. But Polo-&#xD;
ski has lived by cards. le makes gambling a (rofession. He has no other&#xD;
visible means of existence. Moreover, I suspect him of being an impostor,&#xD;
and perhaps worse. I give credit to all that Wolverton reports and hints, ex-&#xD;
-cepting the mere point of actual crime, violation of the laws. I do not know&#xD;
that the man belongs to the criminal classes. That I must admit."&#xD;
"Oh, mysteries of wickedness!" sighed Mrs. Dinneford, her troubled eyes&#xD;
fixed upon the carpet without seeing it.y&#xD;
" What will you do?" asked Wetherel after a pause.&#xD;
"It is Alice!" confessed the wretched mother in a sort of choked cry. "I&#xD;
must tell you the whole of this wretched business. Alice is bewitched about&#xD;
this man. Ever so many other girls are. I have never quite liked him, but I&#xD;
have put up with him for her sake. I have feared some evil, and have fought,&#xD;
in my poor, unfaithful way, against it, and have prayed for help. But my&#xD;
child has been stubborn, and God has hot aided. What can a mother do&#xD;
against her o011. daughter, and against her own foolish heart? I fear that we&#xD;
shall both be terribly chastised. A just God will not spare such unfaithful-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"I trust that there is as yet no understanding--no engagement," put in&#xD;
Lehming.&#xD;
"Oh no!" gasped the mother, not quite sure of it.&#xD;
"And you will-see that none takes place?" begged Wetherel.&#xD;
"I will-strive," stammered Mrs. Dinneford, nearly weeping with the fear&#xD;
that her strivings might be futile against the will of her child.&#xD;
"Oh, we ought to have spoken before," groaned Edward, perceiving the&#xD;
mother's weakness, and anticipating the worst from it. "My only excuse is&#xD;
that I have been so terribly occupied with my wn wretched affairs I have for-&#xD;
gotten my relatives. But do be urgent with Alice! And if your remonstran-&#xD;
ces are of no avail, call us in to plead with her. She does not and cannot re-&#xD;
alize how miserable she might be if she should marry a reckless, characterless&#xD;
adventurer, a man without standing or morals. The dissipation of all i'er&#xD;
property would be tie least of her troubles. He might lead her such a life of&#xD;
domestic wretchedness as she cannot imagine. He might abandon her penni-&#xD;
less in some distant country. Such things have been. American girls have&#xD;
caught sham nobles, and even real ones, to their own sorrow."&#xD;
He spoke with an earnestness and faithfulness which seemed little less than&#xD;
cruel. Mrs. Dinneford, as she looked at him through her tea's, thought of his&#xD;
~esolute and stern uncle, andof all the grim Wetherels of elder days.&#xD;
." Be of good cheer," smiled Lehiming pitifully, as lie and Edward took their&#xD;
departure. "I cannot believe that the Almighty Father in whom you have&#xD;

trusted will.refuse you guidance and strength. If you want human help, send&#xD;
for us immediately. I shall be here again to-morrow, and every day."&#xD;
"God bless you, Walter-and you too, Edward!" called Mrs. Dinneford&#xD;
from the doorstep.&#xD;
A hulking, gorilla-browed man, in a'shaggy white overcoat, looked up with&#xD;
a yellow grin, and a tawdry, painted,.consumptive girl burst into a hoarse gig-&#xD;
gle. Regardless of these two denizens of a world which was not hers, or rather&#xD;
so wrapt and blindly encunibered with her trouble of mind that she could not&#xD;
really see them, Mrs. Dinneford closed the door and went slowly up stairs to&#xD;
enter into conflict with the being whom she loved best in all the world. "It&#xD;
would seem," she piteously thought, " as if it were always true that our foes&#xD;
shall be they of our own household.".&#xD;
Alice, notwithstanding her alleged headache, had not gone to bed. She sat&#xD;
in a little rocking-chair, tossing one foot and biting her lips, half moping and&#xD;
half petulant. She was the picture of a girl who wants her will, who fears&#xD;
that she may not get it, who fears that it may hurt her, and who still wants it.&#xD;
If ever a woman is stubborn and indifferent to consequences, and careless of&#xD;
right and wrong, it is- in a love affair. It may be fairly doubted of many, or&#xD;
even of most women, whether in such matters they exercise either judgment&#xD;
or conscience. They will lie, they will deceive their parents, they will com-&#xD;
mit petty meannesses, and all this without any pungent shame or sense of&#xD;
guilt. The very next Sunday they are at church with demure, faces, and re-&#xD;
main to communion. We are furious at their hypocrisy until we turn to study&#xD;
the lives of their brothers. Then, without a further doubt or growl, we con-&#xD;
cede the purity of womanhood.&#xD;
"What did they talk about?." asked Alice peeyishly, as if suspicious that&#xD;
the conversation below had not been such as to please her.&#xD;
"They spoke of Mr. Poloski," answered the mother, in a tone which con-&#xD;
fessed that the speaking had not been to that person's advantage.&#xD;
Alice uttered an indistinct, sulky, anxious sound, which was not loud enough&#xD;
to be called an exclamation, and which decorum forbids us from describing as&#xD;
t grunt. She knew that something' evil was to be said of her Count, and she&#xD;
did not want to hear it, and she was crazy to dispute it.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLIII.&#xD;
A SPARED ROD AND A 'SPOILED' CHILD.&#xD;
BEFORE Alice could recover her power of speech Mrs. Dinneford was able&#xD;
to tell her all the vague evil which Edward had charged against Poloski, and&#xD;
to add, in a voice of touching appeal, ".Oh, my dear child, do send him&#xD;
away!"&#xD;
Then was exhibited all the unregenerate and little lest than unholy passion&#xD;
of which a nominally good girl, " a member of the church in full and&#xD;
regular standing," can be capable when she is determined on a lover, and is&#xD;
forbidden to have him. Alice cried, but not meekly and sweetly ; she cried&#xD;
in a rage, striking her feet on the floor and complainig loudly, and even scold-&#xD;
ing; it was a grief as unlovely as that of a child who wails and screams and&#xD;
snatches for cake. A man who had only seen this young lady in society,&#xD;
gracious and graceful and entertaining and smiling, would not have known&#xD;
her now .for the same person. 11er eyes were red and flashing; the tears&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHJEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
flowed copiously down her cheeks and spotted her dress; her face was swollen&#xD;
and flushed, and her expression unpleasantly eager and wilful; she had ges-&#xD;
tures which were eloquent certainly, but not agreeable to look upon.&#xD;
The truth is that Alice, good-hearted as she was by nature, had been nearly&#xD;
spoiled by indulgence. Like many another sweett girl"1 of our ' times, sheI&#xD;
had grown up in the belief that life ought to be one everlasting picnic, at least&#xD;
for young ladies. She felt herself wronged, and believed that she had a right&#xD;
to be angry, when she was not amused from morning to night. Self-denial she&#xD;
had none, nor any ennobling longing after labor and duty, but only a desire to&#xD;
"have a good time." At last this sybarite of American democracy, this luxu-&#xD;
rious child of a society which requires all play and no work of woman, was&#xD;
faced by a denial and threatened by a disappointment, all for'her own good.&#xD;
She could not endure' such unaccustomed hardness; she was in an agony of&#xD;
grief and in a spasm of rage.&#xD;
"What stuff 'for Edward to ilk!" she argued, as women and other people&#xD;
in close quarters will do, evading the real point at issue. " What was Edward&#xD;
himself a little while ago? He. was just as wild and dissipated as anybody.&#xD;
ie is a pretty man to bring up stories against other 'people'! Why didn't he&#xD;
say this to Count Poloski's face? He didn't dare to. He was afraid there&#xD;
would e an easy explanation to All' this nonsense. He was afraid he might&#xD;
get his charges, ack in his own face, hot and heavy. What if Count Poloski&#xD;
was seen in a low drinking-saloon? In the first place, I don't believe it. I&#xD;
don't believe that low man, Sweet-a mean, crawling spy and detective! And&#xD;
then what if lie was there? Didn't Charles Dickens go to all the vile places&#xD;
in this city to study character, and in London too?  Count Poloski is a&#xD;
'oreigner. He wants of course to see our criminal classes. It's as likely as&#xD;
not he is writing a book about America. And then he is a stranger here, and&#xD;
I dare say he doesn't know every horrid hole in New York, like that wretched&#xD;
Sweet, and sometimes goes where he wouldn't if he did know. I am perfect-&#xD;
ly astonished at Edward. I didn't think he was so uncharitable and ungener-&#xD;
ous and mean-oh, mean, mean-mean as dirt! Before I would do such a&#xD;
tiing as. this!-blacken my friend's character behind his back!-for lie has&#xD;
been his friend. Oh, I hate men! I hate 'em and despise 'em! They are all&#xD;
mean, and I don't believe a word they say! and oh, I wish I was dead and&#xD;
in my grave!&#xD;
Here came a fresh burst of tears, with sobbings and twitchings of the mouth,&#xD;
and angry stampings and gestures.&#xD;
Mrs. Din neford listened and stared in severe silence. For a brief space&#xD;
this fond an d over-indulgent mother was revolted by her daughter. She gazed&#xD;
at tie girl with an eye which told of illusions lost, at least for the moment,&#xD;
and which sparkled forth contempt and indignation as well as sorrow. It&#xD;
would have been a relief to her sense of justice and to her feelingsito take this&#xD;
silly young personby the arm and give her a sound shaking.&#xD;
But Mrs. l)inneford was very clever; it is probable that early and thorou gh&#xD;
culture might have developed her.into a woman of decided brilliance; and&#xD;
een with her limited educational and social advantages, she had at t&#xD;
flasesvafn'ta-esatmaes&#xD;
flashes of intelligence which were near akin to genius. On the present occa-&#xD;
sion, remembering some follies of her own immature years, and perhaps also&#xD;
e h long pranks of school-girl compaons, she turned from the individual&#xD;
to      x.    e judgment which she uttered was large enough to&#xD;
lime and severe enough to b~e terrible.&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I do believe," she said slowly and sadly, " that no woman ever let her&#xD;
God stand between herself and the man she wanted."&#xD;
" Oh! what do you say that for?" Alice almost screamed, for she had a&#xD;
conscience under her wilfulness, and it stung her wofully at this instant.&#xD;
" There have been exceptions," continued the mother. "But you, my&#xD;
child, are not one of them."&#xD;
Alice slipped out of her chair upon the floor, and grovelled there in a par-&#xD;
oxysm of humiliation.&#xD;
"Oh! you have turned against me," she whimpered. "You are all against&#xD;
me, you and Edward and Walter. I haven't a friend in my family. If ever I&#xD;
want to do anything, you all want to stop me, just for the sake of stopping&#xD;
me, and go to calling me sinful, and silly, and everything else that's horrid. I&#xD;
am the most snubbed and governed and bullied girl that ever lived. Nobody&#xD;
wants me to be happy, and everybody wants me to be wretched."&#xD;
"Alice, stop! And get up! " commanded the mother, still keeping her&#xD;
senses, in Spite of this piteous wail.&#xD;
But the girl would not rise until she had conquered. She had one last re-&#xD;
source, a reserve which had given her more than one victory, and she now&#xD;
brought it into action. She went off in a sobbing, shrieking, jerking fit of&#xD;
hysterics.&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford ought either to have left her, or to have emptied a pitcher&#xD;
of water over her. Nobody ever indulges in hysterics alone, and no young&#xD;
lady will lie still and let a favorite silk dress be spoiled. But Mrs. Dinneford&#xD;
was at bottom soft-hearted, and moreover she was economical. She pitied&#xD;
her convulsed child, she spared the lilac'silk and lace-edgings, and she lost&#xD;
the battle. In a minute they were both weeping together, and the daughter&#xD;
cried to better purpose than the parent. In a contest for mastery between two&#xD;
people who love each other, the victory generally rests with the one who loves&#xD;
least. , By the time that Alice had been lifted from the carpet and laid gently&#xD;
on her bed and soothed with hartshorn and caresses, she had recovered her&#xD;
supremacy over the doting creature who nursed her.&#xD;
"Mamma, don't break my heart!" she sobbed, with her arms around her&#xD;
mother's neck.&#xD;
"Oh, no! I must let you break it yourself, and break mine," wept Mrs.&#xD;
Dinneford, feeling that she was beaten and giving up the struggle in despair.&#xD;
"No, no! He is better than you believe," insisted Alice. "At all events&#xD;
my fate is fixed," she continued in a high-flying, sentimental' tone which ex-&#xD;
pressed romantic egotism and self-worship at least as much as affection.&#xD;
" This man must have me if he wants me. My heart must not be balked' ex-&#xD;
cept by him."&#xD;
"Oh, my child! does he really love you?" asked the unhappy mother,&#xD;
catching at straws for comfort. " If he does, that may save all, even if he is&#xD;
not good."&#xD;
"He has pressed my hand," whispered the -silly girl, for whom we must&#xD;
surely feel a profound commiseration, as well as a wholesome, wrathful deAire&#xD;
to slap her. "And, 0 mamma, I was so happy! I am sure he will be good&#xD;
when he sees how happy it'makes me to have him good."&#xD;
"1God's will be done!" assented Mrs. Dinneford, sinking back from the&#xD;
bed upon her knees. Then, feeling that it was not God's will which was to&#xD;
be done, but something very different from that, she added, "God have mercy&#xD;
upon us!"&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh, mamma, thank you!" whispered Alice, selfishly alert and prompt to&#xD;
seize upon this hardly-wrung concession. She put out her hands, drew her&#xD;
mother's throbbing head to her, and kissed it repeatedly. ' It was a touching&#xD;
scene, and to one who did not know the folly which had ruled it and the&#xD;
vretchied outlook which it'had into the future, it would have seemed a beauti-&#xD;
ful one. - It ended when Mrs. Dinneford started abruptly from her knees and&#xD;
went to her room to fall upon.them anew and alone.&#xD;
Alice had now brought her mother to accept this betrothal; and more than&#xD;
that, she had brought herself to accept.it. It is a curious fact, and indicative&#xD;
of the dark ways of-the feminine soul (not to enter upon the oddities of the&#xD;
masculine ditto), that up to this time she had not been able to decide whether&#xD;
she wanted Poloski or not. She was fascinated by him, and yet she was a&#xD;
good deal afraid that he might make a bad husband, and between these con-&#xD;
flicting sentiments she had seesawed. Opposition had determined her; the&#xD;
moment the man was forbidden fruit she longed for him; in the struggle to&#xD;
have her will she had worked herself into a belief that she ardently loved him;&#xD;
and perhaps there was as much affection in the. flurry as there is in mostof&#xD;
those spasms of the inwards which lead to nuptials.&#xD;
When Poloski'mglade his next call, which happened on the morning follow-&#xD;
ing, it was delicately borne in upon him that a hand would be his for the ask-&#xD;
ig. Women have numerous indescribable ways of imparting such informa-&#xD;
tion, while preserving an air of heavenly guilelessness and freedom from&#xD;
earthly motives, as if they no more thought of marrying than the angels. The&#xD;
man who picks up what is laid fairly and squarely under his nose, is neverthe-&#xD;
less left under the impression that he discovered it all by himself and with&#xD;
great dificulty. It is like giving a mouse to a kitten; tommy invariably sup-&#xD;
poses that he caught it. There are indeed male souls so timid or stupid that&#xD;
they caunot see their good luck with suilioient clearness to lay a paw upon it.&#xD;
We have read of a;lover who shot himself, in despair of winning his Dulcinea,&#xD;
on the very day that she drowned herself because he could not be coaxed to&#xD;
propose. But Count Poloski was not a suitor of this humble and unhopeful&#xD;
stripe. When the mouse was pitched under his whiskers he alighted upon it&#xD;
with- beautiful promptness and dexterity.&#xD;
We cannot say what Alice did; perhaps she incidentally gave him a flower ;&#xD;
perhaps she accidentally touched his hand; perhaps she only gazed meekly into&#xD;
his eyes. But in the next second the Count had her by the trembling fingers,&#xD;
and was pouring his tale of exotic love into her simple Yankee ears. In the&#xD;
next minute she had cried, and had laid her hot, wet face on his noble shoul-&#xD;
der, and had whispered a frightened, happy "Yes," and in short was a "gone&#xD;
goose."&#xD;
Poor little feminine republican! She did not really admire the man;; she&#xD;
more or less thought him a jackanapes, and perhaps a bad fellow ; but her&#xD;
democratic soul was entangled and laid helpless in the meshes of a title. How&#xD;
many 'daughters of freedom, not to dilate upon a "smart sprinkling" of fathers&#xD;
and mothers to the same, have gone and done likewise! One wonders whether&#xD;
the time will ever come when our countrymen will be able to say with un-&#xD;
shakable pride, feeling that there is no loftier boast on earth, "I am an Ameri-&#xD;
can citizen! " Probably not while our politics remain in their present dlema-&#xD;
gogical chaos. If bosses continue'to rule our cities, and old war-horses to&#xD;
neigh brutish stupidities in our Congress, it will be well if the entire nation #&#xD;

does not follow the example of Alice Dinneford, prostrating itself before some&#xD;
Poloski and saying, " Rule thou over us."&#xD;
When poor Mrs. Dinneford was informed of the betrothal, she could say&#xD;
nothing cheerful to her daughter or her prospective. son-in-law. She kissed&#xD;
Alice with convulsive affection, and endured Poloski's kiss without returning&#xD;
it. During the greater part-of the day she remained in heri room weeping,&#xD;
reading the Bible, and praying. Tupper was no egmfort; even Bunyan failed&#xD;
to lift her the least bit out of her Slough of Despond; she could cling to noth-&#xD;
ing but the " Promises."&#xD;
But grieved as she was, she made no further fight; 'once more her child&#xD;
had altogether triumphed over her; the sorrowful woman, to use her own&#xD;
forcible phrase, "had given up."  When Edward called in the afternoon she&#xD;
wrote on a card, " Alice is engaged--I cannot talk of it," and so sent him&#xD;
away unseen. A similar missive met Lehming, and got rid of him likewise.&#xD;
Nor would Alice see her cousins; she was furious at them still for maligning&#xD;
her Poloski; she did not mean to forgive them unless they came to her wed-&#xD;
ding.&#xD;
Perhaps, too, she kept her room out of a vague fear lest these cruel men&#xD;
had found some new accusation against her Count which would come hard&#xD;
upon forcing her to dimiss him. We must, leave her to her selected destiny,&#xD;
premising that it will not be a wehspring of pleasure.&#xD;
-CHAPTER XLIV.&#xD;
A PROSPECTIVE COUNTESS.&#xD;
Mus. DINNEFORD was at first greatly amazed, as well as terrified and&#xD;
grieved, by the result of Alice's flirtations.&#xD;
She was as much astonished to find herself the prospective mother-in-law&#xD;
of a dandified, grimacing, philological foreign Count as a sober hen might Ae&#xD;
at discovering that she had hatched a hook-nosed, flame-colored, jabbering&#xD;
macaw. It was really pitiful to see the eager, ruffled, clucking way in which&#xD;
she watched his struttings and gasconadings, as if she were wondering what&#xD;
noise this outlandish bird would make next, and fearing lest he should'peck&#xD;
the coop to pieces. Little by little,.however, she became somewhat numb to&#xD;
the situation, and even learned to treat her daughter's betrothed with a certain&#xD;
exterior cordiality, smiling much at him in a mechanical, placating way, and,&#xD;
so to speak, dumbly interceding with him not to be as bad as he could be.&#xD;
He on his part saw that virtue was desired of him, aid did his best to in-&#xD;
spire hope that it would be forthcoming. To hear him talk about himself was&#xD;
like listening to a fairy-tale about the "good prince."  According to his tell-&#xD;
ing, lie was oneof the finest fellows morally that you could set your mind's&#xD;
eye upon.. He had never done a dishonorable thing; that was a point on&#xD;
which he frequently and copiously insisted; nothing unworthy of a gentleinan !&#xD;
nothing unworthy of his ancestors! nothing ignoble! And then lie was so&#xD;
rich; he had such enormous and little less than Immeasurable territories!&#xD;
such hosts, and ever increasing hosts, too, of tenants! The most remarkable&#xD;
thing about his estate, indeed, was the facility with which it committed annex-&#xD;
ation and doubled its population. The expansion of the United States and the&#xD;
increase of the children of Israel in Egypt were as nothing by the side of these&#xD;
phenomena. In truth it seemed alarmingly probable that if Poloski continued&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        171&#xD;
to talk about his county, it would shortly absorb all Europe. A!s a matter of&#xD;
course he was beloved to distraction by his multitudinous retainers; when he&#xD;
should return to them they would pour forth to receive him with shouts, and&#xD;
redden the domed night with bonfires of welcome. Of course also these gral-&#xD;
deurs involved a footing in the highest walks of society, and an easy entree to&#xD;
all the courts of Europe. His Alice, his adored and dashing Alice, would be&#xD;
a "sure-enough countess and no mistake," he declared, falling back upon one&#xD;
of his favorite "slangs " for a vividness of description suited to the brilliant&#xD;
fact. In a word, the copious and imaginative man confessed and afliried him-&#xD;
self to be a most desirable match, both in spirituals and temporals.&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford could not help. swallowing somewhat of a tale which was&#xD;
put to her lips so often and so earnestly. She Was hopefully anxious to be-&#xD;
lieve; she shut her eyes and opened her mouth, as children sayq doubt was&#xD;
such a torment that she almost prayed for faith. Moreover, it is the nature&#xD;
of women, shielded as they usually are from the business-like realities of life,&#xD;
to grant easy credence to the new, the unheard of, the marvellous. The ex-&#xD;
cellent lady actually feared at times lest her own and her daughter's head&#xD;
should be turned by the social altitudes which they were about to ascend. . She&#xD;
thought of Satan leading people up into high mountains, and promising them&#xD;
kingdoms and the glory thereof, if they would fall down and worship him.&#xD;
She meditated upon the warnings and reproofs which her favorite Massillon&#xD;
(she read him in a translation) levelled against the "great ones of the earth "&#xD;
who forget that they are human. As for Alice, that credulous and ambitious&#xD;
young lady had fairly departed out, of her Yankee senses, and resided altogether&#xD;
in cloud-castles of Polish construction.&#xD;
We must not linger long on thedelectable mountains of this Poloski en-&#xD;
gigement. Of course there was a deal of love-dalliance between Miss Dinne-&#xD;
ford and her noble adorer, which we should find savory to the minutest sugared&#xD;
crumb, if we could stop to feed upon it. But delicacy with regard to the young&#xD;
lady, and the summoning :voices of more important adventures, oblige us to&#xD;
omit tasting of these deleterious sweets. We must, however, state the satis-&#xD;
factory fact that the Count's presents were all that a future countess could&#xD;
reasonably expect. A superb engagement ring was the forerunner of pearl&#xD;
brooches, coral earrings, choice mosaics, and other similar proofs of highborn,&#xD;
opulent affection. Even Mrs. Diuneford was presently driven to admit that&#xD;
Poloski's revenues must be ample, and that his heart seemed to be'in the right&#xD;
place. Indeed, gifts came in so abundantly and of such an obviously costly&#xD;
nature, that this mother in Israel, educated to regard economy as a weighty&#xD;
duty and a bright virtue. felt herself called upon to remonstrate.&#xD;
"You: are giving Alice too much," she whispered to the extravagant&#xD;
grandee. "It really seems to me like wasting wealth, and I fear that some&#xD;
day it may be regretted. Such generosity may spoil any girl, and lead her to&#xD;
expect too much hereafter. You must forgive me for quoting to you a line&#xD;
of iy favorite poet, Tupper: Rashly give they, and afterward are sad, a gift&#xD;
that doubly erred."&#xD;
"Bali! a few inexpensive trifles," laughed the Count, showing all his fine&#xD;
teeth. " Excuse me, my very dear Mrs. Dinneford, for treating your most&#xD;
kied and ,valued warning with gayety. I am profoundly impressed by the&#xD;
softness of your heart and the hardness of your head. But money is a drug.&#xD;
There is more where this comes from.. I haven't got to the bottom of my pile&#xD;
by a long shut."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6242-00000087"/>&#xD;
TIlE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
He quoted so many of our American "slangs," and he laughed so victori-&#xD;
ously after each one pi them, that Mrs. Dinneford was silenced for a mo-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
"Besides, there is more coming," continued Poloski, " We '-shall have&#xD;
plenty to live on. Miss Dinneford is to get a fortune from the Wetherel es-&#xD;
tate. Aha! you see that I know all. There is, money on both sides. Why&#xD;
should there not be a few jimeracks and knicknacks?"&#xD;
"I ought to speak to you about that," answered the good woman promptly&#xD;
and firmly. "You have heard, I suppose, that my poor cousin, Judge Weth-&#xD;
erel, left us a large property. It is my duty as a Christian woman to tell you&#xD;
the exact truth of the matter. ' The will was lost and all the estate goes to&#xD;
Edward Wetherel."&#xD;
"I know-I have understood," hastily muttered the Count. He was not&#xD;
looking at her; his eyes were wandering unsteadily about the room; he seemed&#xD;
to her to be awaiting further information.&#xD;
"Edward may give us something," hesitated Mrs. Dinneford, who did not&#xD;
feel quite certain of the gift, now that Alice was about to make this dubious&#xD;
match in spite of Edward. "lHe has declared his purpose of so doing. I query&#xD;
and worry daily as to whether we ought to accept."&#xD;
"Is lie mad, and are you all mad?" exclaimed the Count, turning upon her&#xD;
with a stare of irritated amazement. "Why should you not accept? But he&#xD;
will not give. No man gives away a fortune who is not forced. The thing is&#xD;
to force. You' wait! I will attend to this business. You wait and see. All-&#xD;
'that is yours shall come to you. The moment I shall have power to act for&#xD;
Miss Alice I will make things to happen. I will makesome one restore that&#xD;
estate. You shall have all your money.- You wait and trust in me. Say&#xD;
nothing. Keep dark. Wait.",&#xD;
" Do you mean to charge Edward  -? " stammered Mrs.,Dinneford, open-&#xD;
ing her eyes wide in an obscurity full of horrors, and feeling as. if she were&#xD;
turning dizzy on the verge of an abyss.&#xD;
"I charge nothing," answered the Count, still looking away from her.&#xD;
"But I will cause some one to disgorge. Wait till I am married. I will see&#xD;
to all. I ask nothing of you but to trust in me and keep dark."&#xD;
He would explain no further. Mrs. Dinneford went out from this inter-&#xD;
view quite confounded' and terrified by it. What frightful thing had the man&#xD;
uttered, or rather what frightful thing had he concealed? But after much&#xD;
meditation she decided that his discourse had been mere high-flying babble,&#xD;
such as she supposed foreigners could not help indulging in, especially if they&#xD;
were counts. Alice, when informed of Poloski's tall talk, expressed the same&#xD;
opinion of it.&#xD;
"It is just some of his blank verse," she said in a tone of half petulance,&#xD;
half apology. "I must admit that he does sometimes go on like a fairy-tale,&#xD;
or like Mother Goose's Melodies," she added, unable to control her Wetherel&#xD;
wit. "But I believe all those European continental folks do the same. They&#xD;
have so much more vivacity and imaginationthan we Yankees! He has said&#xD;
something of this sort to me once or twice. I don't know what he believes or&#xD;
what he means to do. I didn't ask him. I didn't want to talk about it. It is&#xD;
such a horrid, hateful. subject."&#xD;
After a little she resumed hesitatingly: "Mother-do you suppose Ed-&#xD;
ward can have-done anything wrong?"&#xD;
"Oh, Alice!" implored Mrs. Dinneford, putting up her hands. "Don't say&#xD;
&#xD;
i2&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
any such words to me. They are like the whisperings of Satan. We must&#xD;
resist such thoughts as uncharitable and wicked temptations."&#xD;
" I don't believe in him as I did," murmured Alice, who had not forgiven&#xD;
Edward for opposing her match and maligning her lover.&#xD;
Walter believes in him," replied Mrs. Dinneford, with a profound con-&#xD;
fidence in the intelligence of Lehming, and little knowing the doubts by which&#xD;
he was tormented.&#xD;
"You shan't misjudge my Count," broke out Alice, after watching her&#xD;
mother's worried face for an instant. "He is not to blame for having his sus-&#xD;
picions. A great many people have-had suspicions. Just think what a mud-&#xD;
dle it has-all been. Uncle Wetherel dead, and Nestoria spirited away, and the&#xD;
whole thing as black as midnight! "&#xD;
"I know," sighed Mrs. Dinneford. "We have cause to be thankful for&#xD;
that we have been allowed to keep our reason amid it all."&#xD;
"And you won't think hardly of him because he talks a little fancifully now&#xD;
and then ?" begged the girl. "You will think kindly of him?"&#xD;
"I will,"'promised .the: mother, unable to resist an only child, a child, too,&#xD;
whom she was not used to resisting.&#xD;
But Mrs. Dinneford and even Alice herself did come to feel a little hardly&#xD;
toward the noble Poloski,,when a few days later he broached the idea of an&#xD;
immediate marriage, to be followed by instant departure for Europe.&#xD;
"I have letters which call for me to arrive," he alleged. " I must arrive&#xD;
as soon as I can go. There are family affairs,.very urgent. My sister is&#xD;
about to contract a marriage which is undemeaning of her and of our family.&#xD;
I must hasten to prevent it."&#xD;
What should be done? What girl wants to be hustled through that triumn-&#xD;
phal march, that review which celebrates love's greatest victory, an engage-&#xD;
ment?. The wedding trousseau was not selected; the robes of silk and the gar-&#xD;
ments of fine linen were not made up; the hymeneal glories of all sorts were&#xD;
in an entirely embryonic condition. Mrs. Dinneford mildly argued against&#xD;
the confounding- proposition, while Alice protested, implored, pouted, and&#xD;
finally wept. The Count did not take opposition sweetly, and there was a scene.&#xD;
of the kind known as a love quarrel.&#xD;
For a time the two women stood firm, upheld by the importance and gran-&#xD;
deur of the situation, and by that habit of commanding the inferior sex which&#xD;
American females have. It was proposed that the patrician lover should go&#xD;
to Poland alone, and return as soon as he had finished his lofty business. But&#xD;
he looked so sulky over this suggestion that it seemed quite probable that he&#xD;
might not return at all. What if one of those titled' ladies whom he would be&#xD;
sure to encounter in the courts of Europe should throw herself at his head and&#xD;
cause him to 'orget the simple New York girl who had nothing to give him&#xD;
but a heart and some democratic dollars? Moreover, he was heard to mutter&#xD;
something about the insulted honor of his family and the possibility of a duel.&#xD;
These bugbear i were too much for Alice. In general a woman does not&#xD;
want to break off an engagement unless she is. comfortably certain of entering&#xD;
promptly upon another, seizing the hand of Number Two simultaneously with.&#xD;
dropping that'of Number One. Furthermore, Alice, like most newly betrothed&#xD;
girls, had just set seriously to the work of loving. The Count had been daz-&#xD;
zling to her betoi e he proposed; but now that he had been accepted, he was&#xD;
.precious. It is one of the noble characteristics of the feminine heart that in&#xD;
general it worships all the more earnestly for winning. Alice was beginning&#xD;

&#xD;
to be honestly and almost passionately and we must say admirably infatuated&#xD;
with her man, for the reason that she had got him and could call him her own.&#xD;
When it seemed likely that she might have to part with him, and when she&#xD;
was assaulted by the still more dreadful idea that he might rush into mortal&#xD;
combat if she did not watch over him, she gave up her rapturous' dream of a&#xD;
long engagement and a splendid wedding, and consented to become a wife&#xD;
without ti'opsseau or cards.&#xD;
The surrendry of Alice was punctually followed by that of Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
"I consent," she said, dropping a tear over the thought of so early a parting.&#xD;
" Heaven's will be done!-if it is heaven's will," she added with some temper.&#xD;
" But I shall follow you, if you are gone two months. I shall break up and&#xD;
rent the house and follow you."&#xD;
" I shall be delighted, I am sure," bowed the Count with a grin which ex-&#xD;
pressed a very skeleton-like sort of joy.&#xD;
And so the wedding day was fixed for a week later: it was the 25th of&#xD;
November which was to be thus honored; and on the 26th the happy couple&#xD;
were to set sail for Hamburg.&#xD;
CHAPTER XLV.&#xD;
A PHILANTHROPIC CONSPIRACY.&#xD;
ONE naturally marvels what the able and energetic Edward Wetherel is&#xD;
doing all this while, and why he does not interfere in some Olympian manner&#xD;
to save his cousin from her risky entanglement.&#xD;
In apology for the young man we must observe that it is not so easy to de-&#xD;
liver a young woman who positively objects to deliverance. . Besides, he was&#xD;
breathlessly busy in these days, as indeed he had been ever since the tragedy of&#xD;
Sea Lodge, although we have not deemed it worth while to follow him up in his&#xD;
labors, which resulted in nothing more than mere futile rushing and raising&#xD;
of dust, like the speed' of a blinded Jeu ,who drives furiously to arrive no-&#xD;
where. It is only fair to him that we should listen to a bemoaning apology&#xD;
for himself which he uttered about this time to Lelhming.&#xD;
"I am bringing nothing to pass," he exclaimed fretfully. " But it does&#xD;
seem to ine that it is less my fault than the fault of ungovernable circum-&#xD;
stances. I have been driven to grapple with two awful mysteries-that of&#xD;
my uncle's assassination, and that of Nestoria's disappearance-and they have&#xD;
wasted all my time, and beaten me."&#xD;
Lehming was smitten by a twinge of conscience and of compassion. Ie&#xD;
had by this time recovered a certain degree of trust in Edward's innocence of&#xD;
murder; and for a moment he was impetuously tempted to say, "I will show&#xD;
you Nestoria."&#xD;
" Horrible problems!" resumed Wetherel, shaking his head with a pathetic&#xD;
air of lassitude. "They are too much for human ingenuity. They are like&#xD;
ghosts to whom daybreak has not yet come, and who will persist in walking&#xD;
the earth. Not one happy accident has favored my search; not one disen-'&#xD;
tangling clew has fallen within reach of my hands; and heaven knows how&#xD;
eagerly they have groped. IBut I am;not the 'only one who is baflled ; I am&#xD;
only one of a perplexed multitude. Tle mousing of justice is equally at fault,&#xD;
and the scent of public suspicion. The police of New York is as completely&#xD;
bewildered as the police of Connecticut. Is it not monstrous and demoraliz-&#xD;
&#xD;
174&#xD;
&#xD;
ing that one vile assassin should be an overmatch for all the human race? It&#xD;
is not true that murder will out., It is a popular delusion, helpful to the gen-&#xD;
eral conscience undoubtedly, but as false almost as a superstition of fairies or&#xD;
witches. Since I have been engaged in seeking out this homicide I have&#xD;
heard of dozens and scores of others, all equally fallen into the dust of mystery&#xD;
and become impalpable. Unconvicted and unsuspected murderers elbow us&#xD;
in the streets. - It is a hideous, haunted world. I have some such feeling&#xD;
about it as men must have had in other days when they believed in spectres,&#xD;
brownies, wizards, troubling goblins, and physical manifestations of Satan.&#xD;
I am constantly discovering, or rather seeming to discover, things which are&#xD;
invisible to others' eyes, and which probably do not exist. Every day, and I&#xD;
might almost say every hour, I see possible- assassins. I am followed and&#xD;
whispered to by credulities and suspicions which vanish as soon as I question&#xD;
them. The earth has changed to me; it is no longer an ordinary, natural,&#xD;
sunlit planet; it is a valley of the shadow of death, full of demoniacal appari&#xD;
tions. Bunyan saw a part of existence as I see the whole of it."&#xD;
There was a passion, an exaltation, and a lyrical extravagance in his lan-&#xD;
guage which showed that his imagination had been heated and set on fire by&#xD;
the crime which had impinged upon and deflected his life. 'There had been a&#xD;
collision of a mighty event with a soul, like the fabled shock of a comet&#xD;
against a planet, and the result had been a conflagration, In his other days&#xD;
of commonplace beipg he could not have talked with this lurid fervor of&#xD;
fancy. Lehming listened to him and looked up at him with that surprise&#xD;
which we accord to those who have ascended some mount of transfiguration.&#xD;
Had you not better suspend for a time this search after the assassinP "&#xD;
he asked with hesitation. "It may end in becoming a fixed idea, and inter-&#xD;
fere with your usefulness throughout life."&#xD;
"Yes," conceded Wetherel with a sigh. "It may. It has already wasted&#xD;
much time for me. For months now I have done next to nothing but grope&#xD;
for traces of crime without finding them. I have not shown myself to much&#xD;
advantage. I have been a mole, working incessantly, but working under&#xD;
earth, and finding no exit. All the plans for doing some little good, which I&#xD;
blabbed and bragged about to you a while since, have come to nothing. You&#xD;
remember that I proposed to instruct and help the working classes. I haven't&#xD;
lone it; of course I haven't. How can a man carry out philanthropies when&#xD;
he is startled every day by some false view-halloo- after an atrocity which con-&#xD;
cerns his good name and happiness? Now I am in chase of the murderer of&#xD;
my uncle, and now of the kidnapper of Nestoria. I am not a sufliciently great&#xD;
man to be a mighty worker and a benefactor of my kind amid such a distract-&#xD;
ing hurly-burly. I can only say for myself that I have nearly settled that&#xD;
estate, and that I have made some progress in my medical studies."&#xD;
Lehming still pondered whether he should revel. the hiding-place of Nes-&#xD;
storia to this man who seemed so honestly and passionately eager to find her.&#xD;
But he remembered the girl's word; wait{ he remembered his promise that he&#xD;
would keep her secret; and, with a profoundly troubled spirit, he turned to&#xD;
another urgent subject.&#xD;
"'What will you do with the Dinnefords?" he asked. "Here is this&#xD;
wretched marriage. If-you pay those two women some large sum of money,&#xD;
what will become of it? Poloski, whatever else he may be, is a gambler and&#xD;
a spendthrift'&#xD;
" I am master in this matter, of course," replied Wetherel. "1. shall pay&#xD;

them, but under a trusteeship, and I shall be the trustee. I decided upon that&#xD;
step as soon as I heard of the engagement."&#xD;
"Have you ever considered one thing?" continued Lehming. "I have&#xD;
thought of it repeatedly, but never when in your company. This will-this&#xD;
will that you accept and talk of executing-you have no knowledge of it except&#xD;
through Mrs. Dinneford."&#xD;
"Mrs. Dinneford is such an entirely unselfish and honorable woman that I&#xD;
should hardly doubt her unsupported word, even in a transaction so much to&#xD;
her benefit," replied Wetherel tranquilly. "But I have other evidence. In&#xD;
the first place, my uncle told me that he should cut me off, and he was a man&#xD;
who never said more than he meant. In the second place, I found in his&#xD;
journal a record of the making of the will, and a summary of its leading pro-&#xD;
visions."&#xD;
"Ahi!" said Lehming. "All that is new to me. I have occasionally wonr&#xD;
dered whether you were not acting on insufficient testimony.'?&#xD;
"No," responded Wetherel.&#xD;
For a moment the two superbly unselfish men looked at each other in ad&#xD;
miration.&#xD;
"I thought you knew all this," resumed Wetherel with a smile. "You&#xD;
are very incurious about your own affairs, and indifferent about money. I dare&#xD;
say it is well for civilization that some men set greater store by it."&#xD;
"Undoubtedly," admitted Lehming. "The greedy and even the miserly&#xD;
are immensely useful, in spite of their egotistic and sordid motives. Capital&#xD;
ists are essential to the advancement of the material and also the intellectual&#xD;
and moralinterests of mankind. I have no doubt that Sallust's gardens and&#xD;
even Lucullus's suppers helped to elevate the human race."&#xD;
At this moment up came Wolverton, radiant as usual with the careful dan&#xD;
dyism of thirty odd, but with a perturbed air of having something on his mind&#xD;
and of finding it a worrying novelty.&#xD;
"Have you heard anything?" asked Wetherel eagerly, as if he expected&#xD;
important information.&#xD;
"0A good deal," answered Wolverton in a hurried, confidential tone. "He's&#xD;
a tough curse, that fellow is. I got Sweet to track him again, and Sweet has&#xD;
a doose of a story to tell, and I -believe it. He doesn't go to Riley's any more;&#xD;
but why doesn't he? - Because he has set Riley's daughter wrong; at least&#xD;
that is what Sweet tells me, you know; and so the girl's father and brothers&#xD;
are after him. Of course he could make it all right by marrying the little&#xD;
fool; but that he won't do because she's common trash, and he's a gentleman.&#xD;
Isn't the whole thing devilish ridiculous? Poloski too much of a gentleman&#xD;
to marry Riley's daughter ! Besides, there's this other bewitched young lady&#xD;
(1 beg your pardon) and a chance of. getting a fortune by her,;or at least a&#xD;
moderate pot of money. Of course he isn't going to marry poor little Riley.&#xD;
Well, the result is (so Sweet tells me) that his life is in danger. If the male-&#xD;
Rileys meet him, they'll break his skull or something of that sort, and he&#xD;
knows it.' That's why he wants to hurry up the wedding and get off for Eu-&#xD;
ro'pe.".           a&#xD;
"It must be stopped," scowled Edward. " We must take this story at once&#xD;
to Mrs. Dinneford.".&#xD;
" Yes-if it will be of any use," drawled Wolverton. "PIl hunt up Sweet,&#xD;
and we'll all go together, if it will he of any use. But will it? Women are&#xD;
so devilish unbelieving of' warnings in such matters! The man who says, You&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         177&#xD;
are a dear creature, is always believed; the man who says, You are not a dear&#xD;
creature, he is a liar; that's the way women judge. Can't you thrash the&#xD;
chap within an inch of ,his life, or get some one to do it? Sweet would ham-&#xD;
mer him to ajelly, for money enough. That's my idea."&#xD;
It would not convince them," Judged Wetherel. "Besides, it is an un-&#xD;
mannerly, disorderly way of doing things, begging your pardon, Wolverton."&#xD;
Oh, we mustn't stand on decorum with such a low beast," said the dandy.&#xD;
Manners are for gentlemen."&#xD;
" But my relations would always think ill of it," persisted Wetherel. " I&#xD;
should lose their esteem and confidence. want to convince them that the&#xD;
fellow is a lnave, before I treat him as such."&#xD;
"You are different from what you used to be," said Wolverton.&#xD;
"Yes,".assented Wetherel gravely. " I should have thrashed him once, I&#xD;
suppose, without stopping to think. I have been sobered, you know."&#xD;
Oh, I dare say," mumbled Wolverton, shrugging his shoulders a little as&#xD;
he thought of that ugly business, the Wetherel Affair. " Well, let's see. You&#xD;
want to expose him. I can bring about a sort of exposure, if there is time for&#xD;
it. Here we are at the 23d, and the wedding comes off on the 25th, and they&#xD;
sail on the 26th. There,.isn't much leeway. I'However, what I can show is&#xD;
this: I can show it to be pretty certain that Poloski hasn't any property; I&#xD;
can show, too, that he.is charging all his bills, or some of them, to Mrs. Din-&#xD;
ncford'&#xD;
That will help," said Edward.&#xD;
-tOh, yes, I can make a pretty fair showing there," laughed Wolverton.&#xD;
"ft's a good joke. He's run up ldtsof bills for Mrs. Dinneford to settle. His&#xD;
wedding clothes, his presents to the young lady, the engagement ring, and so&#xD;
on-they are all down against the mother. You see he has been around among&#xD;
the foreign dealers, the Jews and so forth, and told them who he is going to&#xD;
niarry, and got his two or three thousand dollars on credit. The bills are to&#xD;
go in to the old lady on the 27th, the day after the happy pair have started for&#xD;
Europe. Now that can be shown. Sweet knows of three or four heavy ac-&#xD;
counts,.and says there are others. You see he has had his eye on Riley's gang&#xD;
for some time back, and on Poloski as a supposed member of it. lIe found&#xD;
Out that the noble foreigner had been, buying largely of late, and he looked&#xD;
into it; and, as I told you, he came across three or four bouncing bills charged&#xD;
U) Mrs. Dinneford, and heard of others. By the way, Wetherel, Sweet wants&#xD;
some, money."&#xD;
"Ill give him something," returned Edward. "Suppose we look him up&#xD;
and set him about this exposure. I am greatly obliged to you, Wolverton,&#xD;
for attending to my business for me, and doing it so well."&#xD;
Oh, it's nothing," drawled the dandy., "In fact, it rather amuses me,&#xD;
and slaughters the time. Besides, I want to smash Poloski."&#xD;
A walk to the Tombs 'and a brief search through that sombre and grimy&#xD;
edifice (within human memory the pride of New York) brought the three men&#xD;
face to face with detective Sweet. He was dressed in a velveteen'shooting.&#xD;
jacket, double-breasted vest of the same material, and corduroy trousers, all&#xD;
showing signs of wear and tear, especially the latter. le looked a little worn&#xD;
and torn himself, too, his face being as red and scratched as if somebody had&#xD;
been filing it, his eyes unusually bloodshot and one of them surrounded by a&#xD;
blish halo, and his knuckles " barked " in various degrees of rawness.&#xD;
"Excuse my breath, gentlemen," he hoarsely apologized as he drew con.&#xD;

&#xD;
fidentially close to Wolverton and Wetherel. " I've been taking a restorer&#xD;
or two. Up all night last night."&#xD;
"I want to see you about that Pole, Count Poloski," said Wetherel. "You&#xD;
tell Mr. Wolverton here that the man has been getting his accounts charged&#xD;
to a Mrs. Dinneford. Can you prove that?"&#xD;
"I can get the bills," declared Sweet with cheerful promptness.- "I ca&#xD;
get-let mesee-six. I can bring yot six of them debits any day you want."'&#xD;
"Do you know where Mrs. Dinneford lives?" 1&#xD;
"I can get full name, number, and street, off one of the dealers' books. It&#xD;
was all down."&#xD;
"Very well. Now have those bills sent in to-morrow, the 24th of Novem-&#xD;
ber, at twelve o'clock, without fail. Here is something for your expense and&#xD;
trouble thus far. Can I dpend on you? To-morrow at noon."&#xD;
"Twelve sharp," replied Mr. Sweet. "Thank you, sir; you're a gentle-&#xD;
man. Twelve to-morrow, November 24th. You can bet on me. Do you&#xD;
want 'em presented for collection? All right. I'll bring the chalks myself,&#xD;
with a C. 0. D. No; that won't do, either. I don't want this man to know&#xD;
that I am on his trail in any way. I'll send the dealers."  .&#xD;
"If you fail, it is the last job you get through me," said Wetherel grimly.&#xD;
"If I fail, may I be busted!" imprecated Mr. Sweet. "Oh, you just lay&#xD;
your pile on me, Good morning, Mr. Wetherel. Very much obliged to you.&#xD;
You're a gentleman-and a cutthroat prehaps," he muttered'to himself as the&#xD;
three visitors went out of hearing. "But I don't know 's I much blame him,"&#xD;
he continued to soliloquize in a fair-minded spirit. "A million is a pile of&#xD;
money. It's enough to make any man kill his uncle. And if W etherel done&#xD;
that job, he's a regular smart one, and I respect him. He hain't left a trail,&#xD;
and he's as sassy as a saint in Paradise."&#xD;

CHAPTER XLVI.&#xD;
SEVERE MERCY.&#xD;
A   LITTLE before noon of the day preceding the one fixed for Alice's patri-&#xD;
cian nuptials, Edward.Wetherel and Walter Lehming arrived at Mrs.&#xD;
Dinneford's house to await the advent of Count Poloski's creditors.&#xD;
The two women were tired, but hard at work, and anxious enough in the&#xD;
secret places of their hearts, but gay in countenance. There were many im-&#xD;
portant things yet to be done; there was a hasty bridal robe which must have&#xD;
some final embellishments; there was a dressmaker to -be supplied from mo-&#xD;
ment to moment with ribbons and other necessaries of life; there was a colla-&#xD;
tion, just decided upon, which must be ordered instantaneously from Delmon-&#xD;
ico's; there was the inevitable hurly-burly of a wedding that is to be. Leh-&#xD;
ming's compassionate heart turned sick as he looked upon these preparations&#xD;
for woman's highest ceremony of happiness and honor, and thought how soon&#xD;
they would tumble into disappointment, grief, and shame.&#xD;
"had'you not better try to rest, you two?" lie said. "You will want&#xD;
strength by and by."&#xD;
" Did you ever know a girl who hadn't strength enough to get married?"&#xD;
replied Mrs. Dinneford, and not by any means gloomily, for the excitement of&#xD;
the occasion had given her a vivaciousness which verged upon gayety. "It is&#xD;
the one thing that a daughter of Eve can always find the might to do, even if&#xD;
she is at death's door."&#xD;
" What is the matter with you, Walter?" burst in Alice gleefully. " You&#xD;
look as white as if you were going to be married yourself. Now, if you are&#xD;
turning pale on my account, you may save yourself the trouble. My Count&#xD;
will be a good husband. You wait and see."&#xD;
Lehming glanced imploringly at Edward. He pitied this infatuated girl&#xD;
and this overborne mother with all the fervor of his sensitive spirit. Foolish&#xD;
as he knew the desire to be, he half wished that the exposure which was to&#xD;
turn their blithesomeness into weeping, might be averted, and half hoped that&#xD;
if they should have their bewildered will, it might not be to their hurt. But&#xD;
there was mio-relenting in that other young mhan; he was as calmly resolute&#xD;
and unflinching as his uncle might have been in his place ; he was a Wetherel&#xD;
of the ancient, remorseless, Cromwellian type.&#xD;
" Do sit down and take a minute's repose," begged Lehming, seizing Mrs.&#xD;
Dinneford's tired, trembling hands, and drawing her to a sofa.&#xD;
"Edward, I am out of all patience with you," said Alice. "You look as&#xD;
grim. as a justice. I know what you are thinking, and I don't like "it. Be-&#xD;
sides, it's of no use. You can't make me give up this step at the eleventh&#xD;
hour. I shall get married. So don't say a word about it and don't scowl.&#xD;
What do you want to spoil my wedding for? It is too bad. My own cousins&#xD;
groaning and glowering at me! It is too bad."&#xD;
She was about to cry, but just then the door bell rang, and in an instant&#xD;
she was all cheerful excitement, her cheeks glowing and her'eyes sparkling&#xD;
splendidly&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETIIEREr. AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6242-00000091"/>&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"There are the ribbons," she laughed. "Why don't they answer that belP&#xD;
I wonder if there is a servant in the house."&#xD;
The domestics were slow in coming. Meanwhile there was another ring,&#xD;
and another, and another.&#xD;
"They must be out, those creatures," exclaimed Alice petulantly.&#xD;
"I will go," volunteered Edward, guessing what visitors waited admit-&#xD;
tance.&#xD;
He stepped into the hall, opened the street door, and ushered in six men,&#xD;
all wearing more or less of the shopkeeping air and all of foreign aspect.&#xD;
" What is your business? " he asked.&#xD;
"My bishnish ish money," answered a somewhatsgreasy and rancid young- .&#xD;
ster of brief stature and aquiline profile, at the same time exhibiting a slip of&#xD;
paper.&#xD;
Wetherel looked with an imperturbable countenance from one to another.&#xD;
of the half dozen. Each and every one held forth a bill, with more or fewer&#xD;
words of stammering explanation; mean while glancing suspiciously at his com-&#xD;
rades.&#xD;
"Islh this a do?" asked the one who had first spoken.&#xD;
Let me have your bills," responded Wetherel. "And wait here."&#xD;
Stepping -back into the parlor, he said in a clear; strong, merciless tone,"&#xD;
"Mrs.. linneford, here are six tradesmen with their accounts. What shall I&#xD;
say to them?"&#xD;
"I don't owe a cent in-the world," exclaimed the astonished lady. "I pay&#xD;
everything by the week."&#xD;
"Just look at these and see what they mean," persisted Edward, handing&#xD;
her the slips of paper.&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford put on her spectacles and read aloud, "One diamond ring&#xD;
-three hundred dollars! ' I never bought a diamond ring in my life,"'she&#xD;
broke out.' "Did you, Alice? "&#xD;
The young lady's face was scarlet, and she merely responded by shaking&#xD;
her head.&#xD;
"One coat, one pair pants, one vest," continued the mother, glancing at a&#xD;
second bill. " Why, this is some ridiculous mistake. These men have got the&#xD;
wrong house."&#xD;
But she looked agitated; - she had her ping of wretched divination; it&#xD;
seemed to her that something ugly was at hand.&#xD;
"Come in here, all of you," summoned Edward, opening the door into the&#xD;
ball. "Come in and explain."&#xD;
They entered, the entire half dozen; they told their six stories in six dia.-&#xD;
lects of imported English; and all the six swindling, humiliating tales were&#xD;
one. 'Mr. Boloski, or Boloshki, or Ploskee, or Plosk, as they variously styled&#xD;
him, had, bought this, that, and the other at "our shop,"' and ordered the bill-&#xD;
for the "lot" to be sent to Mrs. Dinneford, or Tinnevoort, or whatever it&#xD;
might be.&#xD;
The miserable mother, still not quite comprehending this confonding and&#xD;
disreputable muddle, turned and stared at her still more miserable daughter.&#xD;
Alice had not spoken since the men entered the room, and she could not&#xD;
speak now. She had dropped into the chair which stood nearest, her face en-&#xD;
tirely destitute of color and her head swimming. One, of the duns, an nn-&#xD;
wholesomely sallow little creature, with wavy, glossy, carefully-brushed jet&#xD;
hair, lhad his beadlike, glittering eyes fixed on her hands. She noticed hia&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
glance, and it startled her like the crawlng of a serpent, and she found power&#xD;
for action and utterance. With a shudder of disgust she commenced stripping&#xD;
her fingers of emeralds and diamonds.&#xD;
"There they are," she said, handing Poloski's betrothal offerings to Leh-&#xD;
m ing, who had stepped toward her with a fear that she might swoon. "Give&#xD;
them to their owners. Mother, you must get the corals and the other things,&#xD;
and send themtoo."&#xD;
Then came a 'sob-an outburst of insupportable humiliation-and with a&#xD;
rush and flutter she was gone.&#xD;
"Go with her," urged Lehming, addressing the stupefied mother. " We&#xD;
will attend to these men."&#xD;
" Yes," added Wetherel. "Come into the hall, you people," he continued&#xD;
to the six clerks.- "I will tell you what this means."&#xD;
He led them out, and after a few words of explanation, sent them away,&#xD;
some of them happy at recovering their merchandise, and others gloomy over&#xD;
the prospect of collecting from Poloski.&#xD;
When he returned to the parlor he was astonished by finding Alice there.&#xD;
She was crying, without even trying to wipe away her tears, or seeming to&#xD;
know that they were falling. She was weeping, sobbing, talking, and pacing&#xD;
the room all at once; it was a storm of grief, of shame, and of anger overmas-&#xD;
tering both; it was weakness, and yet it was strength.&#xD;
"I came back-I wouldn't stay up stairs," she gasped out between her&#xD;
sobs. "I have just one thing to say-just one thing and no more. le is all&#xD;
you told me. ,I believe everything now. lie is a contemptible liar and swin-&#xD;
dier and impostor. I have done with him. Oh, no doubt about that. I came&#xD;
back to tell you so. J never will see him again. Never! If he has the face&#xD;
to come here, I want you to drive him away. He is a mean impostor. Ie is&#xD;
a liar. I don't believe a word he ever told me. You have carried your point,&#xD;
Edward. I suppose you did this. You have almost killed me. But I thank&#xD;
you. Is that enough? Are you satisfied? You ought to be."&#xD;
Edward took her hand, kissed it respectfully, and tried gently, to make her&#xD;
sit down. But she resisted him; elastic and strong with hysteria, she broke&#xD;
away and kept-on walking the parlor; the storm of sobbing, tears, and sharp,&#xD;
jerky talking did not cease for some minutes. What she said was mainly re-&#xD;
iteration; but it was necessary that she should reiterate; nothing else would&#xD;
soothe her agitation. Like her niotlher, she was a born talker, and mist bab-&#xD;
ble out all her emotions or choke with them.&#xD;
Do be quiet, child!" begged and commanded Mrs. Dinneford repeatedly,&#xD;
alarmed by the girl's excitement.&#xD;
"I must talk or (lie; let me alone! " returned Alice, and whirled on in her&#xD;
gust of feverish speech. It was like a tempest in autumn woods, only that in&#xD;
place of withered boughs and frostbitten leaves, blighted hopes and joys were&#xD;
blowing about, noisily rustling forth their shame and spite.&#xD;
"I knew it-I knew it all the while-I knew I was a fool," she chattered.&#xD;
'I knew at the bottom that I was wrong. I knew it would end badly. And&#xD;
it has. It has served me just right for being such a fool. I would have my&#xD;
own way, and I've got it hot and heavy. I've got i right in my face and eyes.&#xD;
This puts an end to Alice Dinneford.' I shan't go out again in society. It's&#xD;
the last beau I shall have, unh'ss I pick up some old gentleman with a shiny&#xD;
top and gold spectacles. You'll see me marry Methusaleh, or.1the old original&#xD;
Jacob Townsend, if you see me marry at all. But I want this Count to catch&#xD;

&#xD;
trouble, too. Oh, I want him to have the hot end of the poker. I had no bu-&#xD;
siness to believe his lies, but he had no business to lie. How glibly he did talk&#xD;
about his estates and his revenuesand his money in bank! And he hadn't a&#xD;
cent; charged his wedding coat to my mother; and my engagement presents&#xD;
went down on those Jews' 1 ools! Oh, how I do despise him and hate him,&#xD;
and what a time we should have had in a month! I wish he was in jail and&#xD;
grinning through the bars."&#xD;
"Alice, do hush!" implored the mother.' " You are turning yourself inside&#xD;
out, like a fig-fish on the seashore. You are making a perfect spectacle of&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
"And why not?" gasped Alice, throwing herself breathless into a chair&#xD;
and patting the floor with her feet. "Edward and Walter know all about it&#xD;
already. I can talk before my cousins, can't I? I can trust them, can't IF&#xD;
And I niust talk. I must foam over, or explode. Corking this thing up would&#xD;
kill me. Don't you know it would, mother? You are just like me. If I&#xD;
were not gabbling all the time, you would be."&#xD;
And,.in fact, Mrs. Dinneford was talking all the time, or striving so to do.&#xD;
As was their wont in moments of unusual excitement, the two women ran&#xD;
parallel streams of conversation, each gushin. along without much regard to&#xD;
the other, like the Rhone and the Arve at their confluence. Only on this oc-&#xD;
casion the superior volubility of the daughter constantly put the mother out,&#xD;
and rendered her pretty much inaudible. The burden of the elder lady's frag&#xD;
mentary discourse seemed to be this, that her child had been graciously fa-&#xD;
vored with a wonderful preservation, and that Providence had interfered just&#xD;
in the right season to tbeach a precious lesson of prudence and humility. Mean-&#xD;
time the two men had withdrawn, as it were, to mountains of silence, accord-&#xD;
ing to the custom of male creatures when the fountains of feminine eloquence&#xD;
are broken up and the waters thereof overspread all creation.&#xD;
Of a sudden Lehming, who had taken refuge in a window-seat, called sharp-&#xD;
ly, "Here is the mpan."&#xD;
"Let him come in,".replied Wetherel calmly. "But had not you two la-&#xD;
dies better leave the room?"&#xD;
Yes; go, Alice," urged Mrs. Dinneford.  "You must not meet him.&#xD;
Now, child, do go!""&#xD;
"I shan't stir a step," responded Alice spunkily. "I want to look at him'&#xD;
when he catches it."&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVII.&#xD;
EXORCISING A SON OF -BELIAL.&#xD;
WHEN Poloski entered the parlor Alice neither answered his bow nor eva-&#xD;
ded his glance, but sat with burning cheeks and sparkling eyes, biting lie lips&#xD;
and tossing her foot and staring at him, an incarnation of frank, hearty, quiv-&#xD;
ering, feverish scorn and indignation.&#xD;
For an instant the visitor of course supposed himself at home, and adva need&#xD;
with proffered hand and his usual cordial show of glistening teeth, uttering.&#xD;
salutations and compliments to right and left. But when no hand was put&#xD;
forth to take his, and when he saw that all present eyed him with unfriendli-&#xD;
ness, he was perforce driven to guess that some event adverse to him had be-&#xD;
fallen. The discovery seemed to startle him quite wonderfully; lie became as&#xD;
pale an " aristo " as a communist could wish to look upon. -&#xD;

I&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR&#xD;
&#xD;
183&#xD;
&#xD;
"I do not understand this deportment," he stammered, glancing hurriedly&#xD;
from face to face. "I demand to know the meaning of this deportment."&#xD;
Edwiard Wetherel, with an imperious gesture which commanded the-others&#xD;
to be silent, advanced close to the noble foreigner and looked him instantane-&#xD;
ously out of countenance.&#xD;
"Mr. Poloski, if that is your real name-" he began deliberately.&#xD;
" Count Poloski, sir!" interrupted the Pole, making a spring to recover the&#xD;
upper hand in the dialogue. "In view of this deportment I claim to be ad-&#xD;
dressed by my title."&#xD;
"It is my duty to charge you with an imposture," continued Wetherel,&#xD;
taking no notice of Poloski's reclamation. "You have betrothed yourself to a&#xD;
young lady, py relative, under pretence-of being a man of fortune, while you&#xD;
were so utterly penniless and even without credit, that you were obliged to&#xD;
charge your engagement presents, and, even your own 'wedding outfit, to this&#xD;
young lady's mother."&#xD;
" It is not so !" screamed the Count, turning from pale to crimson. "There&#xD;
is some ridiculous error. I said to charge them to myself. Mrs. Dinneford,&#xD;
I appeal to you, I protest to you, there is some error."&#xD;
"Six men would not make the same mistake," Wetherel observed.&#xD;
There have been six tradesmen here, all with bills against Mrs. Dinneford,&#xD;
and all declaring that they presented them by your order."&#xD;
The Count swore in a whisper under his moustache, like a panther spitting&#xD;
softly through his whiskers.&#xD;
"Your engagement ring," continued Wetherel, "all your betrothal pres-&#xD;
ents, the clothes you have on your back, the clothes you meant to be married&#xD;
in, the trunks for the wedding journey, your new revolver, dirk, and sword-&#xD;
cane-we got the bills for all of them a few minutes since, all charged to Mrs.&#xD;
Dinneford."&#xD;
"It was a mistake, it was a:mistake," repeated Poloski. "I do assure you&#xD;
solemnly, and upon my sacred honor, it was a stupid, cruel mistake."&#xD;
"Ohm, I know it," smiled his pitiless antagonist. "You ordered that these&#xD;
accounts should be presented on the 27th, two days after the wedding, and they&#xD;
arrived on the 24th, the day before it. That was the mistake."&#xD;
"I will not talk with you; 1, have nothing to do with you!" declared the&#xD;
Count, 'turning his back on Edward and trying to subdue the women with a&#xD;
glare; for though he was wretchedly cowed and even frightened, he still had&#xD;
some spirit left. "I claim my rights. I demand my betrothed wife." .&#xD;
" Go away; sir!" cried Mrs. Dinneford, rushing in front of her daughter.&#xD;
She was really alarnied-had, as we remember, an old, native suspicion and&#xD;
fear of foreigners; half expected to see the Pole grab up Alice and run out of&#xD;
doors with her.       /&#xD;
Poloski fell back and began to wheedle, bowing and extending his arms&#xD;
deprecatingly, and beaming out with'such smiles as lie could get together' in&#xD;

behold in me an object of terrorP I offer no violence; I menace no harm. I&#xD;
but.ask an interview with Miss Dinneford."&#xD;
By-dint of dodging about lie caught several glimpses-of Alice's face, and&#xD;
meanwhile lie made her a series of short speeches, backing tlAem up with&#xD;
smiles and gestures.&#xD;
"Miss Dinneford!" in a tone of reproach. "My dear Miss Dinneford!"&#xD;
in a tone of entreaty, "Aice !" in a tone of romantic sweetness. " Will yoc&#xD;

not grant nie one word? One single moment alone? A chance to explain?'&#xD;
A chance to reassure you? -Oh, for the sake of the vows we have inter-&#xD;
changed, give me one instant of interview!"&#xD;
Alice continued to gnaw her lips without opening them. In this talkative&#xD;
young lady silence was an unmistakable sign of extreme, ungovernable irri-&#xD;
tation in the way of wrath. Mrs. Dinneford, who of course -knew all her&#xD;
daughter's moods, absolutely trembled at seeing her speechless, fearing lest&#xD;
the next thing might be hysterics or some act of violence. "Edward! Ed-&#xD;
ward!" she called eagerly, at the same time signing Poloski away.&#xD;
Wetherel advanced, and before him the Count retreated, halting,,however,&#xD;
near the door. There he surveyed his foes with a perplexed expression, obvi-&#xD;
ously very anxious to make his peace with them and reestablish the engage-.&#xD;
ment, but quite as obviously doubtful whether he had best utter all that was&#xD;
upon his mind. His eyes wandered; }his lips parted and closed again several&#xD;
times; lie had something to.say, and did not know how to put it.&#xD;
You must excuse me," he began at last with an apologetical smile, "I&#xD;
have to tell you one thing which it seems you know not. You are all laboring&#xD;
under a social misapprehension. What I have done is not strange in Europe.&#xD;
When a nobleman goes to espouse a-how shall I say it?-I mean no offence&#xD;
-a bourgeoise-she always pays the bills. That is understood; that is the&#xD;
bargain; everybody understands it so-that is, everybody in Europe. The no-&#xD;
bleman has rank and the bourgeoise has money,; and they swap, as you Amer-&#xD;
icans say; they swap. She gives him her money and he gives her his rank.&#xD;
I have known, of many young nobles who have had all their wedding expenses'&#xD;
paid by their betrotheds when the latter were bourgeoises. It is nothing new&#xD;
in Europe. It is understood."&#xD;
It may easily be guessed that Mrs. Dinneford and Alice were thunder-&#xD;
struck by what seemed to them the outrageous insolence of this business-like&#xD;
explanation. 'I do not know what they would have said if they could have&#xD;
spolien; probably there would have been a scornful and angry outburst to the&#xD;
effect that an American lady is the equal of any noble; but the lucky fact is&#xD;
that they were stricken dumb, and so preserved their dignity by not uttering a&#xD;
word. Edward answered for them, and not without a certain moderation and&#xD;
considerateness of tone, for he was half inclined now to believe that he had a&#xD;
real aristocrat before him, so patrician-like was the Count's cool assumption of&#xD;
social superiority.&#xD;
'-You are quite rightPoloski," he said. "You have stated the European&#xD;
idea correctly'. But it makes no difference. My relatives do not want an alli-&#xD;
ance with you on such an understanding, or on any understanding.  You&#xD;
should not have acted in this matter covertly. As things are, you are a con-&#xD;
fessed liar, and, I think I may add, swindler. Now go, and let us hear no&#xD;
more of you."     -&#xD;
"A liar! a swindler! " grinned Poloski furiously, jumping forward three&#xD;
inches or thereabouts. "But no! " he added, checking his mad career  " You&#xD;
know nothing of honor. You would call the police. You are a coward."&#xD;
" Go away and don't be noisy, or I shall call the police," continued Weth-&#xD;
erel in a quiet, resolute voice.&#xD;
"Ha!" hissed the Count, slowly retreating. "Call the police! You? A&#xD;
murderer call the police! What a joke is that!"&#xD;
Both men were ghastly white now, but Wetherel advanced and Poloski re-&#xD;
coiled. -When the latter found himself in the hall he grappled up his- hat,&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        185&#xD;
clapped it upon his head with such force as if he were loading and ramming&#xD;
himself into it, and, emboldened by this action of defiance, turned to blaze out&#xD;
a last word.&#xD;
"Revenge!" he shouted, in a style which italics, capitals, and exclamation&#xD;
points can but faintly symbolize. "Revenge !! REVENGE!!!"&#xD;
It was suich a salvo of menacing elocution as perhaps was never paralleled&#xD;
before in real life, not'even among the Count's own rhetorical countrymen.&#xD;
We can only account in full for his -preposterous emphasis by supposing that he&#xD;
was familiar with our drama, and imagined that certain popular American ac-&#xD;
tors do really and truly hold the mirror up to American nature, and inferred&#xD;
that, if lie did not roar, his anger would not be believed in. It is a pity that&#xD;
Miss Imogen Eleonore Jones could not have heard him; she would have found&#xD;
in him a hero of the sort which she had learned to admire in the " Spasmod-&#xD;
ic "; she would have joyed in such a rich and rare manifestation of the ideal.&#xD;
Well, he had scarcely exploded ere he was gone, tearing open the street door,&#xD;
skipping briskly out of it, slamming it behind him, and flying down the steps&#xD;
as if he were exemplifying the chorus, "Rig a jig, jig,.and away we go."&#xD;
When Vetherel i-euntered the parlor, with an irrepressible smile of Anglo-&#xD;
Saxon scorn on his lips, lie found that Alice had leaped from her seat on the&#xD;
sofa, and was gazing out of a-window. She turned a flushed face toward him,&#xD;
and asked in an eager, panting, way, " Did you kick him out, Edward?1"&#xD;
"No," replied the young man, wondering if he had come short of the girl's&#xD;
expectations. "le seemed to kick himself out.' He went off like a shilling&#xD;
cannon, loaded to the muzzle. He gave a great bang in one direction and&#xD;
vanished like lightning in the other."&#xD;
" Oh, how I hate him! " burst out Alice, thoroughly disgusted with her dis-&#xD;
charged lover and with herself. A moment later she began to cry violently--&#xD;
an altogether bewildered and hysterical and nearly demented young lady,&#xD;
beset at once by grief, humiliation, anger, and no one can tell what other emo-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
" Dear me, if the brazen nature of sin hasn't been uncovered and revealed&#xD;
to-day most wonderfully !" exclaimed and moralized Mrs. Dinneford, as she&#xD;
led Alice away to her bedroom to administer soothing andi repose. "I really&#xD;
thought, in my simplicity, that fraud and lying and all wickedness were niis-&#xD;
trustful and timorous and shamefaced, fearing the eye of the upright and the&#xD;
injured. And here I have seen a son of Belial as bold as if he were the lion&#xD;
of the tribe of Judah. I do believe that that impostor would have the front to&#xD;
walk into the New Jerusalem and claim the highest saintly throne there, and&#xD;
put a crown on his head and go to singing."&#xD;
After the two women had retired, Wetherel turned to Lehming and ob-&#xD;
served, " Apparently this battle is won."&#xD;
"You have won it," replied the meek and gentle manikin. "Ihave done&#xD;
nothing. I have no nerve for combats. Do you know that I actually pitied&#xD;
that exposed swindler, and could hardly look in his degraded, wretched face? "&#xD;
"I have not done with him.," said Wetherel. " lie must be followed up&#xD;
and driven out of New York society, before lie victimizes another innocent."&#xD;
"Of course," nodded Lehnming. " And, by-the way, perhaps a word more&#xD;
may 1)e needed here to keep our friends from readmitting him. You know&#xD;
tnat, after 1piabolus was chased out of the city of Mansoul, h3e got in again.&#xD;

&#xD;
tongue, he is anaconda enough to swallow them. . Do you stay and warn.&#xD;
must go."&#xD;
He was anxious to get back to his lodgings and see to the safety of Nesto&#xD;
ria. Of late he was always troubled about her when she was out of his sight&#xD;
imagining that hie had been discovered by the police, or had been suddenly&#xD;
frightened into running away, orin some other way had stumbled down the&#xD;
steeps of calamity. We must understand that she had by this time grown ter-&#xD;
ribly precious to him, and had become the centre and cause of nearly all his&#xD;
thoughts and emotions.&#xD;
Quitting the Dinneford house, he made for Fourth avenue at the best pace&#xD;
permissible-to his shortness of limb and of breath, and jumped into a street&#xD;
car which was humming and droning, like a huge, slow bumblebee, in the'di-&#xD;
rection of his lodgings. From time, to time the heavy vehicle halted, or per-&#xD;
haps only slackened its lumbering jog, to take on or put off other passengers.&#xD;
He was moralizing over the matter; he was saying to himself, that this was&#xD;
like the great chariot of huinai life, every second souls born into it and souls&#xD;
dying out of it, yet the chariot always full and seemingly of much the same&#xD;
people; he was, thinking of these things in his imaginative,,tender, Seyious&#xD;
way, when two persons in the car suddenly aroused his earnest attention.&#xD;
One of them was his fellow lodger, Imogen Eleonore Jones, and the other was&#xD;
that no doubt useful but not altogether agreeable official, Mr. Sweet.&#xD;
What startled Lelning was the fact that these two individuals appeared to&#xD;
live some understanding; either they knew each other already, or they were&#xD;
in a state of mind to strike up an acquaintance; at all events they exchanged&#xD;
frequent and interested glances. If they were intimates, or if they should be-&#xD;
come such, would Nestoria's secret remain hidden? Would it not tumble out&#xD;
of Miss Jones's shallow " bread-basket " into the dangerous aids of detective&#xD;
Sweet?&#xD;
CHAPTER XLVIII,&#xD;
A STREET-CAR FLIRTATION.&#xD;
LEIIMING was so alarmed by the ocular telegraphing which he observed&#xD;
between Sweet and Imogen Eleonore that lie lost his self-possession and decided&#xD;
upon the wrong-course'of action.&#xD;
He sat on the same side of the car with the girl, but partitioned from her&#xD;
and thrown into shadow by the vast bulk of a portly old gentlenian in a caped&#xD;
overcoat, who furthermore canopied his little figure with an open newspaper.&#xD;
He might have revealed himself to Miss Jones, interrupted her mysterious&#xD;
communications with the detective, and escorted her home. But there was a&#xD;
little guilt upon his soul; he knew that he was hiding from justice a witness&#xD;
whom justice needed and demanded;. and the result was that lie himself had&#xD;
a feat of policemen and desired to evade their notice. So he left the car fur-.&#xD;
tively, took a hack at the nearest stand, and drove with all purchasable speed&#xD;
homeward, discovering indeed that Nestoria was still' unmolested, but leaving&#xD;
the simple schoolna'am to the machinations of Mr. Sweet.&#xD;
Now these two we must follow and watch-not because they are already&#xD;
acquaintances, but because they are to become such. Mr. Sweet was on duty,&#xD;
but, as in the case of Satan, his duty permitted him to wander much up and&#xD;
down the earth, and even to have "his little fun" in It. It was his cue t-day&#xD;
to go to and fro in good clothes and otherwise to play the part of a gentleman,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
so far at least as his kind ofnature and grace enabled him to play it. le was&#xD;
on the lookout for female pickpockets, and. this was why he had taken a seat&#xD;
opposite Imogen Eleonore. There was in fact something flashy and dlashy&#xD;
about that young person's outward attire, as there was, we remember, about&#xD;
her intellectual outfit, the frippery and trappings of various spasmodical hero-&#xD;
ines. Mr. Sweet, with his usual insight, judged at first glance that she was&#xD;
one of the light-fingeyed sisterhood, or otherwise of illegal habits, and there-&#xD;
fore took a seat where he could watch her. Miss Jones, who soon observed&#xD;
his detective oglings, judged with her usual insight that Mr. Sweet was a gen-&#xD;
tleman and was smitten with her. So, she ogled back; not that she at first&#xD;
meant to do it; in fact she had very proper ideas concerning street-car flirta-&#xD;
tions; but there was, she felt, such an attraction in this man's gaze as amounted&#xD;
to fascination; and the result was that for every glance she returned a glance.&#xD;
Oho! " said Sweet to himself, suddenly getting a new insight. "That's&#xD;
what's the matter. She ain't a huntin' for wallets an' wipes. She's out on a&#xD;
flirt."&#xD;
le had no objection. He was very fond of love-making in public convey-&#xD;
ances, and frequently indulged in it when not too much absorbed by his " biz."&#xD;
There was to be sure a Mrs. Sweet, who kept1an eye on him and sometimes&#xD;
"worked up his case " for him, judging him.with extreme severity for his po-&#xD;
liteness to other ladies, or, as he phrased it, "sending him up for seven year."&#xD;
But his wife was at hoiie minding her business, and so he felt free to gaze&#xD;
tenderly at Miss Jones, and finally to launch a semi-wink at her. Imogen&#xD;
Eleonore-was thrilled to the very core of what soul she had by this demonstra-&#xD;
tion of interest. She did not consider it a wink; could not call it by such a&#xD;
vulgar name. To her mind it was a gentle half-closing. of the eyes, such as&#xD;
the most romantic and aristocratic of lovers at first sight might indulge in,&#xD;
and very similar to ocular gestures which she had read of in her favorite&#xD;
weekly literature. Such a blush came over the whole of her face that her&#xD;
very hair seemed to be the redder for it, as if the blood had gushed along the&#xD;
capillary tubes. It must, be remembered that she was on the whole a plain&#xD;
girl, and that consequently strange gentlemen rarely winked at her.&#xD;
Well, she was not only much moved, but, in spite of her sense of the p'ro-&#xD;
prieties, she was gratified. How is a poor young woman, who knows few men&#xD;
and is not courted by any of the few-how is she to feel when a fellow traveller&#xD;
in a street-car shows symptoms-of admiration? Is a spasm of flattered vanity&#xD;
and of human sympathy to be strictly forbidden .under such circumstances?&#xD;
But we cannot stop to apologize for Imogen Eleonore; we have enough to do&#xD;
to tell what she did and what resulted. She looked again at Mr. Sweet; and&#xD;
then he looked at her; and then she looked at him; and then he at her; and&#xD;
so on. Sweet was used to this sort of thing, and worked at it patiently, as if&#xD;
it were a "case."  He knew by this time what lie was about; he was flirting&#xD;
with a milliner, or a shop girl, or some other "piece of calico; " he had no&#xD;
high and mighty~,expectations. Miss Jones, much less keen in detecting the&#xD;
caste of people, and deceived by the detective's fashionable raiment (a second-&#xD;
hand suit bought of an actor), supposed that she had touched the heart of some&#xD;
social magnate, and began to wonder whether it would all end in her keeping&#xD;
a carriage. That was the difference between them; the one, though an officer&#xD;
of justice, was' a tolerably sharp knave; the other, though an instructor of&#xD;
youth, was a little of a fool.&#xD;
As may be supposed, JImogen Eleonore's fancied carriage did not appeal&#xD;
&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Immediately to convey hbr to a brown-stone front in Fifth avenue. On the&#xD;
contrary, she got out at her usual corner, with a small, depraved-looking gro-&#xD;
cery stuck on the nib of it,'like a brandy blossom on a drunkard's nose, and&#xD;
made her customary pilgrimage down a pungent by-street to her sordid lodg-&#xD;
ings. Sweet was eager to follow her, but he had a job on hand which called&#xD;
him further down town, and his noble motto was, business before pleasure.&#xD;
So he simply took a mental note of her costume, speculated for a moment as&#xD;
to whether she lived in -his tenement-house, or that, or the other, and then,&#xD;
bending his soul to his duties, forgot her for some hours, as men do forget.&#xD;
Two days later Miss Jones found among the " Herald" "personals " an ad-&#xD;
vertisenent which set all her veins throbbing. It read as follows: " Will the&#xD;
lady who rode in the Fourth avenue car, with blue bonnet, striped silk, and&#xD;
auburn hair, grant a meeting to the gentleman who sat opposite her in Madi-&#xD;
son Square, with a view to further acquaintanceP Address ' Herald' Oflice."&#xD;
The dazzling signature to this confused piece of English composition was,&#xD;
"Diamond Pin."&#xD;
" Him!" exclaimed Imogen Eleonore, throwing down the paper with an&#xD;
agitation which revealed how much she had thought of her chance admirer.&#xD;
Hiuu! i " she repeated with an emphasis rarely equalled in real life, and for&#xD;
some moments could utter no more, or at least did not. She rose and walked&#xD;
the room; she wished people could see her striving with the unknown.; she&#xD;
looked at herself in the glass, and made that do.&#xD;
" Be it so! " she broke out at last. " This life is no longer bearable by&#xD;
woman. I am too much alone with my own heart and with mysteries. I&#xD;
must thrust out a desperate hand for sympathy, and dh-shall I say it?--for&#xD;
love-yes, love! Be it in Madison Square or otherwheres, I will meet him,&#xD;
and see at least what he truly is, and judge whether he be worthy. Be still,&#xD;
poor fluttering heart! " and here she laid hands on that organ. " Be not&#xD;
afraid of one venture. Perhaps thy consoler is at the end of my impassioned&#xD;
and desperate resolve. Give me pen and paper," she added, as if addressing&#xD;
the " page " who waits on the heroines of the "Spasmodic." "Let me an-&#xD;
swer while I have the strength."&#xD;
And so she wrote a letter to "Diamond Pin" (such a letter as he never&#xD;
saw before out of print), informing him that she would dare to meet him in&#xD;
Madison Square, and fixing day and hour for the thrilling rencontre. By (lint&#xD;
of much impatient and tremulous waiting the appointed time was reached;&#xD;
and Miss Jones, walking the twilight shades in her best dress, encountered&#xD;
Mr. Sweet in his finest suit._&#xD;
"Very glad indeed to have the honor," said the detective, taking off his hat&#xD;
with a flourish common to people who "put on " their manners, instead of&#xD;
wearing them habitually. "I am really so much obleeged that I don't know&#xD;
what to say first," he added, a little abashed by discovering a gleam ofsreal&#xD;
modesty in Imogen Eleonore's alarmed eyes. "You see I didn't hope it, and&#xD;
it's really quite a surprise and takes my breath away," he resumed, summon-&#xD;
ing back his characteristic impudence and doing his best to look gallant..&#xD;
" Would you mind having my arm, Miss, and walking along as if we was go-&#xD;
ing somewhereP It will seem more like folks, you know."&#xD;
So Imogen Eleonore, who did not expect to go so far at the first jump,&#xD;
found herself arm in arm with her nameless admirer, and considerably fright-&#xD;
ened threat.&#xD;
"Oh!" she gasped. "Is not this the very poetry of life! It is terrible."&#xD;
&#xD;
188&#xD;
&#xD;
189&#xD;
&#xD;
In reality it was the very doggerel of life; and Mr. Sweet, a prosaic.&#xD;
minded man with some coarse 'humor in him, rather saw it in that light;&#xD;
while, being used to much severer adventures, and naturally of an undaunted&#xD;
spirit, he could not discover the terribleness at all.&#xD;
"0Oh, shaw, now!' he said cheeringly, at the same time squeezing Miss&#xD;
Jones s bony wrist withhis mighty biceps. " There ain't nothin awful about&#xD;
it., All we're going' to do is to just promenade a bit, and talk things over a&#xD;
few minutes and see how we like each other."&#xD;
"Only, I should feel more like saying to my fears, begone! if I might be&#xD;
allowed to inquire your name," observed Imogen Eleonore.&#xD;
"Certainly," responded this brazen detective. "I don't try to come the&#xD;
incog. over ladies. My name is Livingstoine-C. J. Livingstone.'&#xD;
Miss Jones believed this story, and her -features absolutely twitched with&#xD;
excitement-a spasm of mingled fright and delight. She knew who the Liv-&#xD;
ingstoncs of the manor were well enough-not merely because as a schoolmis-&#xD;
tress she was thoroughly "posted" in the early history of New York, but also&#xD;
because she was aware of their social fame as one of the chief of the "Knick-&#xD;
erbocker families." Nor would her romantic imagination permit her to doubt&#xD;
that this man, upon whose arm she leaned, was a scion of that -aristocratic&#xD;
stock.&#xD;
"It is a grand name," she said with humble flattery, and yet not without&#xD;
a painful throb of envy and littleness, remembering her own undistinguished&#xD;
descent and nomenclature.&#xD;
" And may I ask your name P " inquired Mr. Sweet in a thrilling murmur,&#xD;
the same hoarse murmur in which he said to barkeepers, " Whiskey straight."&#xD;
"Youmay call me-I would prefer you should call me-that is until we&#xD;
know each other more thoroughly-I ask it as a favor that you should call me&#xD;
-Diana Vernon," stammered Imogen Eleonore, revolting from the thought&#xD;
of saying Jones. "Of course it, is not the title of my-my ancestors," she&#xD;
apologized; "but I trust that under the circumstances you will pardon a&#xD;
lady's timidity about exposing herself."&#xD;
"Just so," nodded the detective good-naturedly. "Diana Vernon," he re-&#xD;
peated to fix the words in his memory, for he was not a reader of Scott. "I m&#xD;
satisfied with it if you are."&#xD;
"And now haven't we gone far enough? " said the schoolmistress, seeing&#xD;
that they had reached an end of the square. "I dare not proceed further in&#xD;
this direction."&#xD;
"Oh, well, we'll wheel about and go back again," assented Mr. Sweet.&#xD;
"One place is just as good as another, so long as we're together."&#xD;
By this time Miss Jones had got a little impatient, or at least began to suf-&#xD;
fer somewhat with suspense. She had come here to be courted, and the&#xD;
courting did not seem to begin. We do not feel at libei;g to justify her; .we&#xD;
merely claim that her feeling was natural. Furthermore, it was shared by&#xD;
Mr. Sweet, who also thought that it was about time, as he expressed it in his&#xD;
own mind, to "quit fooling round, and proceed to business." Accordingly he&#xD;
squeezed her arm under his, and remarked, " You are a mighty nice girl!"&#xD;
- "Oh, don't say that!" murmured Imogen Eleonore, scared out of her&#xD;
breath now that the wooing had commenced.&#xD;
"But you are, though, and I'm a-goin' to say it, and stick to it like a pitch&#xD;
plaster," insisted Sweet with another pressure.&#xD;
,"Oh, no !-flatter me, not-bewilder me not!" pleaded Imnogen, throbbing&#xD;
with happiness perhaps as much as alarm.&#xD;

THEWETHEREL AFFAIR.--&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now don't put a dam-damper on a feller! " protested Sweet, slipping&#xD;
that ponderous arm of his around her whalebony waist, for lie believed that.&#xD;
her shyness was in her own way, and that she would be grateful to him for&#xD;
breaking it down.,. " Come, it's dark enough for us to walk a little closer.&#xD;
Nobody.'11 see it, or care if they do."&#xD;
For a moment Miss Jones was paralyzed; for a moment she was squeezed&#xD;
right heartily and without resistance; for, though she seemed to herself to&#xD;
pull away, she did not pull an ounce. But she was really terrified; the mag-&#xD;
azine of honest modesty which lay at the bottom of her silly soul was all&#xD;
aflame; and she did sincerely want to get out of the hands of her athletic ad-&#xD;
mirer. Unable to use her muscles, she remembered that she once had a&#xD;
voice, and she made a spasmodic effort to get it out. In the next instant the&#xD;
dusk of Madison Square resounded to a squeal of, " Unhand me, wretch!"&#xD;
CHAPTER XLJIX.&#xD;
A DETECTIVE IN FULL SCENT.&#xD;
IMMEDIATELY that Imogen Eleonore raised her voice against the aggres-&#xD;
sions of Mr. Sweet, he, to use his own phrase in describing the scene to a&#xD;
brother detective, "set her loose quicker'n powder."&#xD;
He was smartly startled and even gravely scared. If one of the regulars&#xD;
should came along, and should turn out not to be a friend of his, he might get&#xD;
reported for disorderliness if he staid, add might catch a "locustI" across his&#xD;
head if he ran. There was even a chance-shadowy, it is true,bit still dis-&#xD;
agreeable to consider-of being dismissed from the "force."  Furthermore the&#xD;
epithet which this girl had applied to him was alarming because so entirely&#xD;
novel. HIe had been called a great many grievous names in the course of his&#xD;
adventurous life. He had been called a scamp, a scoundrel, a rascal, and a&#xD;
blackguard, with every conceivable accompaniment of supporting blasphemy.&#xD;
But never before, so far as he could remember then or thereafter, had he been&#xD;
addressed as " wretch." It sounded like print; it was genteel and nobby and&#xD;
highfalutin; it struck him as little less than solemn. With a sudden suspicion&#xD;
that his Diana Vernon might be " a piece of muslin," instead of "calico," he&#xD;
let go of her as promptly as if she were a red-hot poker, and commenced apolo-&#xD;
gizing.&#xD;
"Now, good gracious, don't! " he begged eagerly.. "Don't cut up that&#xD;
way. Why I don't care a curse about it, if you don't want it. No idea at all&#xD;
of hurtin' your feelin's or frightenin' you. Why, just look at it. I'm not&#xD;
holdin' you. You can run away if you want to."&#xD;
But Miss Jones did not want to run away. Like most women who are&#xD;
apologized to, she perceived that shd was mistress of the situation; and what&#xD;
she desired was, not to escape from her lover, but to keep him and rule him.&#xD;
She dropped upon a bench, breathed forth a sob or two, and forgivingly asked&#xD;
Mr. Sweet to sit. That gentleman's secret opinion was that he was wasting&#xD;
his time and had better go; but he could not break the enchantment which&#xD;
falls upon male creatures when they are both repelled and invited; so he first&#xD;
took a furtive chew of tobacco to clear his mind and then accepted the invita-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"     1You think me very, very strange, no doubt," sighed Imogen Eleonoro bg&#xD;
way of rekindling the conversation.&#xD;

"Ruther offish." grimly assented the confounded officer of justice. "You're&#xD;
what I call a case. You're a-case as sure as my name is Sweet."&#xD;
"I thought your name was Livingstone," exclaimed Miss Jones, drawing&#xD;
away from him.&#xD;
"So it is-Sweet Livingstone,".rejoined the able detective, promptly rem-&#xD;
edying his mistake.&#xD;
" But you said C. J. Livingstone, I thought."&#xD;
" No; beg, pardon; S. J. Livingstone; that's what I said," undauntedly&#xD;
affirmed Sweet.&#xD;
" Oh-excuse me," murmured Imogen Eleonore. " Pardon my suspicious&#xD;
nature. ' I cannot help it. My life has been a mystery-every day a tragedy.&#xD;
Always, alhvays, some boding cloud above me, sending down from its murky&#xD;
bosom chilling snows of gloom, and blighting every verdant hour just when&#xD;
life looked all tinted with hope. I have lost my trust; I know it. It is very&#xD;
sad, and I struggle against it, but still I remain suspicious."&#xD;
" What is it all about?" inquired Sweet, somewhat bewildered by her sen-&#xD;
sational rhetoric, and thinking that perhaps she could " let him into a case."&#xD;
Just confide the whole business to me," he exhorted in a confidential tone.&#xD;
"Make a clean breast of it; do you good. I may be able to see a way'to get&#xD;
you out of it."&#xD;
Imogen Eleonore hesitated. On reflection it did not seem to her that what&#xD;
tragedies there had been in her life were sufficiently incarnadined with ca-&#xD;
lamity nor sufficiently aglow with romance to arouse the sympathy of a Liv-&#xD;
ingstone. But she wanted to tell something which should make her appear&#xD;
great and interesting to her listener. She began to talk of Npttie Fulton--a&#xD;
fe.w words only, she resolved-nothing that should unveil the secret.&#xD;
" I will not weary you with my own sorrows," she answered in a certain&#xD;
deep tone of hers which she considered "thrilling-ah, thrilling!"  "I have&#xD;
nearly forgotten them of late in pitying the griefs of anotlieP. Such a inys-&#xD;
tery! Imagine a lovely young girl, a girl scarcely yet of woman's years, seek-&#xD;
ing shelter of me from the storms of this cruel world."&#xD;
Mr. Sweet pricked up his ears. Ignoramus and dunce as lie was, he was&#xD;
an eager, unforgetting detective, and lie thought instantly of the youthful&#xD;
refugee from Sea Lodge. le awaited the remainder of the story curiously but&#xD;
in sagacious silence.&#xD;
"She is passing fair-too fair for the sun to shine upon rudely-much less&#xD;
the wind and the rain," pursued Miss Jones. " Ah, such pearly tints and azure&#xD;
eyes and golden hair, and a mouth sweet with the roses of eighteen, yet trem-&#xD;
ulous and imploring, ever imploring with sorrow!"&#xD;
"The very gal!" guessed the detective, hearkening like a spy of the Coun-&#xD;
cil 6f Ten.&#xD;
"6Her tale?" sighed Imogen Eleonore, who, as- we remember, knew next&#xD;
to nothing of Nestoria's history. " Ah, io! That I may not breathe. Let the&#xD;
wings of obscurity that brood over it brood there forever."&#xD;
"What a pity!" groaned Mr. Sweet. "Very handsome young girl, you&#xD;
say, and. rutlher little, and fair complexioned. How I do admire golden hair,&#xD;
to be sure!"&#xD;
You have described her," said Miss Jones, flattered by this preference of&#xD;
his for golden hair, her own being of the " red, i'ed gold," as the ballads say.'&#xD;
"Been with you long?" ventured Sweet.&#xD;
"~ Only about three months-three months of grief and of pity-three months&#xD;
of sorrow and sympathy."&#xD;

192                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
The detective wanted to jump up on the stone seat and crow. It was three&#xD;
months since Nestoria Bernard had vanished the description of her which he&#xD;
carried in his pocket-book tallied exactly with this Diana Vernon's description&#xD;
of her mysterious protdge'e; and he trusted that he had within his reach the&#xD;
key to the Wetherel case, with all the " money that was in it." In his heart&#xD;
he cursed himself and blessed himself for the luckiest of men; and he renewed&#xD;
his attentions to Miss Jones as respectfully as if she were Astor or Vander.-&#xD;
bilt. It was not eager wooing; his soul was intent now upon other things&#xD;
than love; he did not so much as try to obtain a kiss. But he'brought about-&#xD;
an agreement that they two should write to each other under their assumed&#xD;
names, and that before long they should meet again-" ah, yes,-once again."&#xD;
" Come, won't you let me go along with you?" lie begged as she rose to&#xD;
leave him. "I just want to see where you put up. Won't try to crowd in,&#xD;
'poji honor. All I want is to walk by the house now and then, and look at it&#xD;
and think you're their."&#xD;
"Ah, never!" shuddered Imogen Eleonore. "I have those who watch&#xD;
me and whom I stand in awe of,' she added,.remembering Lehming and John&#xD;
Bowlder, and converting them into overbearing caitiffs by an- effort of her&#xD;
fancy.&#xD;
"But your handsome little friend that's in trouble-I do want to give her a&#xD;
lift;" suggested Sweet.&#xD;
It was an unlucky remark; he had. spoken several times already of that&#xD;
handsome friend; had been disagreeably desirous to know whether she " wasn't&#xD;
mighty pretty." Miss Jones, smitten with jealous.r, a§ also with a creditable&#xD;
fear of exposing Nettie Fulton's mysterious secret, ecame all the more deter'&#xD;
mined not to exhibit to her admirer the dingy pover ' of her lodgings.&#xD;
4       "No!" she insisted with unmistakable spunk.  'Never will I quit this&#xD;
spot until you promise as a gentleman not to follow m ."&#xD;
"Oh, well, I give it up, I promise," said Sweet. "  ord of a gentleman,"&#xD;
he added, grinning under his slouched hat.&#xD;
The moment  she left him he summoned a newspap r urchin, clapped a&#xD;
half dollar into his dirty fist, and whispered, " Follow that bit of muslin home,&#xD;
and come back here and tell me the street and number; nd I'll give you an-&#xD;
other fifty."-&#xD;
The boy departed, and the detective walked up and down awaiting his re-&#xD;
turn, shivering in the increasing frostiness of the November blast, but bearing&#xD;
it patiently by the aid of an occasional curse.-&#xD;
&#xD;
The very next morning, as Walter Lehming sat before the fire in his study,&#xD;
swallowed up and almost hidden by a high-backed chair, he heard a masculine&#xD;
step in the hall which he at first supposed was John Bowlder's, and then a&#xD;
voice inquiring through his partially open door, "'Was any coals- ordered&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
"No, my good man," he replied, without looking around. " None in this&#xD;
room.''&#xD;
"It war a young lady what ordered 'em," continued the voice. " Light&#xD;
complected young lady, with blue eyes an' golden hair."&#xD;
Lehming got out of his chair, walked to the door and confronted a preter-&#xD;
naturally grimy coalheaver, who recoiled a little on seeing him, touched his&#xD;
ragged hat and mumbled, "Beg pardon, sir.".&#xD;
JI know that no fuel is wanted on this floor," said the young man staring.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                         193&#xD;
hard at the blackened features of the intruder, for this description of Nestoria&#xD;
disquieted him. "There is certainly some mistake."&#xD;
The next moment 'his heart was in his mouth; he had recognized Mr.&#xD;
Sweet's bloodshot eye. It was not merely bloodshot, it was peculiar in an-&#xD;
other respect; there was a strange roundness and openness about it; the lids&#xD;
exposed the whole pupil. It was the man's weak point as a detective, and,&#xD;
kno wing it, he generally kept his eyelids drooped when in disguise; but on&#xD;
this occasion he was so surprised by the appearance of a relative of the Weth-&#xD;
erels that for a moment he forgot the precaution. Lehiming, a sensitive crea-&#xD;
ture, and gifted with that acute observation of physical characteristics which a&#xD;
writer of fiction is apt to have or to acquire, had noticed this singularity of&#xD;
Sweet's optics the very first time that he saw him, and had never forgotten it.&#xD;
What should he do? Dwarfish, fragile, and gentle, he had no aptitude for&#xD;
physical emergencies, though brave and ready enough in the conflicts of the&#xD;
soul. He simply stood still and stared silently at the detective, palm enough&#xD;
in outward appearance, but speechless with alarm.&#xD;
"Beg pardon, sir--some mistake," mumbled the spy, turning and walking&#xD;
slowly down stairs. He was glad to get away; wondered if he had been re-&#xD;
cognized by Lehiming; hoped not. He had, he thought, discovered some-&#xD;
thing, as for instance that the girl was probably in the house, and that one of&#xD;
the Wetherel set was there also, very likely watching over her.&#xD;
Well, he disappeared, to the great joy of Lehming for one instant and to&#xD;
his great terror in the next. Had the fellow gone to the police-office for a&#xD;
search warrant, and would he return immediately to take Nestoria to prison?&#xD;
Or had he only guessed at-her hiding-place, so that for the next day or two they&#xD;
would see him lurking about the house in various unclean disguises-the ugly,&#xD;
stealthy, pitiless forerunner of the fate which he would be sure at last to bring?&#xD;
Dismayed and perplexed, Lehming stood for some time motionless, now&#xD;
hearkening to see if the boding step of the detective were not reascending the&#xD;
stairways, now cudgelling his meditative gentle soul in vain for some prompt&#xD;
stratagem whereby to deliver Nestoria, and meanwhile half wishing that he&#xD;
were a veteran criminal, so that he might know how to deal with- this guilty&#xD;
and risky situation. He could not resolve to let the girl be seized, although&#xD;
that would have been the easiest step to take, and, as he keenly felt, the right&#xD;
step. She had quite mastered him. Her patience, her endurance, her heroic&#xD;
will, and, more than all else perhaps, her beauty and other graciousness, had&#xD;
made him her slave. Good and intelligent as he was, he had come to submit&#xD;
both his conscience and his judgment to her. He must help to hide her until&#xD;
she should be willing to hide no longer.&#xD;
But how should he save her from this new peril? If he told her that she&#xD;
was watched by a policeman, she would probably run away as soon as night&#xD;
fell; she would once more become a friendless waif on the great, pitiless&#xD;
ocean of life; she might sink under its billows into some undiscoverable cavern&#xD;
of ruin. He decided at last that he must act without consulting her, and force a&#xD;
rescue upon her before she could suspect and evade it. And hereupon his weak-&#xD;
ness in practical affairs showed itself; he found that he could not devise and&#xD;
execute unassisted. He could think of nothing better than to seek Mr"s. Din-&#xD;
neford, reveal to her the whereabouts. and the danger of Nestoria. and ask her&#xD;
help. On this errand he set forth, with the conscience and mien of-a criminal,&#xD;
the most wretched good man in New York,.if a good man he can be called&#xD;
Ite quitted the tenement house by a back way, crossing a narrow yard full&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6242-00000098"/>&#xD;
of rubbish and heaps of coal, forcing open with much difficulty the neglected&#xD;
gate of a partition fence, stealing with the air of a thief through a low grocery&#xD;
store, and tottering out upon a narrow and filthy alley.&#xD;
The Dinnefords he found packing up and preparing to leave New York for&#xD;
a season, in order to escape from Count Loloski's expected persecutions, and&#xD;
from the evil fame of that humiliating betrothal. His heart sank within him,&#xD;
for he inferred that they would not, and indeed could not, stay to aid him.&#xD;
Nevertheless, he thought it best to tell his tale. The two impulsive, warm.&#xD;
hearted, women at once forgot themselves; they were so unselfish and noble&#xD;
that they brought the tears into the young man's eyes.&#xD;
"Thank God!" exclaimed Mrs. Dinneford, half laughing and half sobbing.&#xD;
"The lost sheep is found. Let us rejoice and make merry." Then, turning&#xD;
anxiously to her daughter, 41What will you do, Alice.?"&#xD;
"I will stay here and cuddle Nestoria," returned the girl, forgetful of her&#xD;
-wn troubles, excited, elated, and gay. " Walter, do hurry and bring her."&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER L.&#xD;
HARK FROM THE TOMRS A DOLEFUL SOUND.!&#xD;
T was decided that Mrs. Dinneford should go with Lehming to find Nbsto-&#xD;
ria, and furthermore that she should if possible bring the girl back to her&#xD;
own house, there to hide her until some wiser thing might be done.&#xD;
The difference between the expressions of these two as they set off on their&#xD;
errand was something very curious. Lehming, oppressed and cowed by the&#xD;
illegality of the adventure, had that stealthy, cast-down air which a good man&#xD;
cannot help wearing when his conscience troubles him. Mrs. Iinneford, on&#xD;
the contrary, although a thoroughly worthy and fervently well-meaning soul,&#xD;
felt no inward reprovings whatever. As is the case with most women, she&#xD;
had little respect for statutes and enactments in themselves, but only so far as&#xD;
they seemed in every special case to work sweetness and light, and wanted to&#xD;
evade them whenever they, in her opinion, wrought the contrary. If she re-&#xD;
alized at all that her errand was a law-breaking one, she cared little for it.&#xD;
The idea that she was flying to the rescue of a "lost lamb," who had fallen&#xD;
into a pit of sorrows, occupied nearly the whole of her affectionate and impul-&#xD;
sive spirit. So, while her honest face was excited and anxious, it was also ea-&#xD;
ger and elated and cheerful.&#xD;
Theyleft the house on foot, with-the intention of taking a hack at a stand&#xD;
5ome list since away. But they had scarcely shut the door behind them  when&#xD;
a breathi ss, ragged boy fluttered up the steps, holding forth a letter, which&#xD;
proved to be for Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
It is Cousin John's-hand," she said, as she broke open the dirty envelope,&#xD;
"and it is the very first note he ever wrote me in his life, and something. out-&#xD;
landish must have happened. I do believe Emerson is dead or the sky has&#xD;
f ilen."&#xD;
She read, colored, laughed outright, and handed the billet to Lehming.&#xD;
Dear Coz," it ran, "I am in durance vile. I regret to darken your mind&#xD;
with my calamity; but school keeps not to-day, and Walter is in no set place;&#xD;
a thot- and boys would not find him. Some one who knows me must come to&#xD;
the Tombs and swear that I am a harmless philosopher and no midnight vil-&#xD;
lain. Such is the charge against me, that I am a midnight villain.&#xD;
"Yours in durance vile,&#xD;
"JOHN BOWLDER."&#xD;
"What stupid blunder can this be?" exclaim ed Lehming in great anxiety&#xD;
'Ie says nothing about Nestoria; but she may be there nevertheless. We&#xD;
must go first to the Tombs," he added, though mortally afraid of entering that&#xD;
reputed abode of justice.&#xD;
They walked on hurriedly, found a hack, and set off for the Tombs. Len-&#xD;
rming was in a state of anxiety which amounted to anguish; his diseased heart&#xD;
throbbed so painfully that he could not talk.&#xD;
"Take courage, Walter," said Mrs. Dinneford cheerfully. "This looks to&#xD;
me like a providence. It comes at such a critical time that I cannot believe&#xD;
it to be anything less than an: interposition of the Almighty finger. I trust&#xD;
&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
that it happens for good, and to give us prosperity in our adventure. It is my&#xD;
nature to believe that an interference is always meant in mercy, until I find&#xD;
otherwise. We have few chastisements even which are not covert blessings.&#xD;
That wretched engagement, for instance; the presence of it was alarming and&#xD;
the departure humiliating; but I do entertain a hope that it has sobered Alice&#xD;
for good. She was always a/ child-before, blowing soap-bubbles as it were oud,&#xD;
of the windows of life, and wondering that the passing realities should break&#xD;
them. But now she seems a woman. Didn't you observe somethiing noble in&#xD;
her face and manner anad thoughts this morning? I am so glad you saw it!&#xD;
She was willing in a moment to sacrifice her own plans and feelings for the&#xD;
sake of little, lovely Nestoria. Dear me! that poor child-that wandering,&#xD;
hiding child-what do you suppose ails her? Is she crazy? Have terror and&#xD;
grief discomposed her intellect on one subject? I can't account for her con-&#xD;
duct otherwise. Oh, what a mystery and labyrinth of darknesses this Wether-&#xD;
el affair, as they call it, has been. Well, we shall come to the issue of it some&#xD;
day, and find that every step of the tangled path was plain enough, only for&#xD;
the blindness of our finite sight. Both she and all of us have been guided from&#xD;
on high, and the Lord's guidance is always marvellous, though, it end in a&#xD;
blessing.""&#xD;
"I do sincerely pray that it may end well," sighed Lehming, whose mind&#xD;
and conscience were more instructed than' Mrs. Dinneford's, and saw more&#xD;
sides to every moral question, and had thornier doubts.&#xD;
With a great thumping of hearts-beating sullenly and bodefully, like the&#xD;
drums of an execution-they presently pulled up before the Tombs. The fa-&#xD;
mous headquarters of the New York correctional system, sombre enough by&#xD;
reason of its Egyptian architecture, and still more sombre because of its asso-&#xD;
ciations with crime and punishment, looked unusually lowering through a&#xD;
drizzling rain.&#xD;
"Wait for me in the hack, and keep your face veiled," whispered Lehming&#xD;
as he quitted Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
Then he went trembling up the granite steps and through a heavy, slain-&#xD;
ming door, which seemed to close upon him with a gripe. We have not time&#xD;
to describe the grimy, gloomy great rooms amid which he wandered, nor the&#xD;
lounging and pert or sullen officials who treated him with elaborate disrespect,&#xD;
really putting themselves to some trouble about it.&#xD;
At last he came to John Bowlder; and positively he did not know him.&#xD;
An officer had to clap the imprisoned philosopher on the shoulder and say,&#xD;
" Here is your man, sir," before Lehming could recognize his old friend. It&#xD;
seemed as if an enchanter's wand must have been waved over Bowlder, or as .&#xD;
if his soul had migrated into some new body. Where was the familiar rosy&#xD;
face, and where the confident eye and cheery smile? The poor man was as&#xD;
pale as a sheet, and was ready to sink on the dirty floor with fright, and hai&#xD;
no more joy in his glance than a whipped dog. He was a transfigured create&#xD;
ture in every way; there was nothing left of his usual bigness and bluffness&#xD;
and blowsiness; there was, so to speak, only a skeleton of the original Bowl-&#xD;
der. He was under examination, it must be understood, and had been stripped&#xD;
of his outer clothing. To look at him now one would say that he must have&#xD;
been all outer clothing. The policemen had taken off two coats, two vests,&#xD;
two pairs of trousers, and more woollen undergarments than I dare tell of.&#xD;
At last they had peeled him down to his proper outlines in shirt and drawers;&#xD;
and such outlines, so altered, s9 incredibly!less, so diminished as if by vast dis-&#xD;
tance!- They hardly knew hinm themselves, and half thought they had begun&#xD;
&#xD;
196&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
197&#xD;
&#xD;
with one man and finished with another, so marvellous had been the change.&#xD;
A clothes-stand, on which his removed raiment hung, looked much more like&#xD;
the real Bowlder than did this white taper of a figure.&#xD;
"Ah-Walter!" exclaimed John, putting out a tremulous hand and seizing&#xD;
Lehming with the eagerness of a man whoseeks to save himself from drown-&#xD;
ing. "Here you are at last. Here you are. I want you to. bear witness that&#xD;
I am a good .citizen. Tell these good people so., Tell them that I am not a&#xD;
midnight miscreant. They accuse me, as near as I can make out, of murder-&#xD;
ing our good old friend, Judge Wetherel. You know my innocence, Walter.&#xD;
Get a Bible and swear to it."&#xD;
Even his conversation, stripped and divested as it was of transcendental-&#xD;
isms, was lean and shrunken. A man might have been pardoned for glancing&#xD;
at the clothes-stand to see if his accustomed phraseology had not been hung up&#xD;
along with his garments.&#xD;
Lehming was anxious to know if Nestoria had also been arrested, but he&#xD;
did not dare even to whisper this question in the presence of'justice. So he&#xD;
simply turned to a policeman and inquired, " What is the meaning of this ar-&#xD;
rest?"&#xD;
"Found him in disguise, sir," replied the policeman, who was a tall, pow-&#xD;
erful man of exceedingly combative aspect. "I'll tell you just how it was,"&#xD;
he added with an air of nonchalant condescension, as though lie needn't tell if&#xD;
he didn't want to, and wouldn't have told if he hadn't felt good-natured. "I&#xD;
was passing along my beat in Fulton street, an' I saw this old feller wheeling'&#xD;
bricks with a lot of Irishmen, an' I knew the minute I laid eyes on him he&#xD;
wasn't used to the business. He was a-totterin' around, you see, an' a-tippin'&#xD;
over his load and a-buckin into the other men, an' akin' a tinker's mess of&#xD;
it generally. Well, says I, that's comical, an' so I stopped a bit to watch him.&#xD;
I thought, of course, it was some dead beat who was trying' to earn a dollar,&#xD;
and wan't in the habit of doin' it. But after a while lie fell down over his bar-&#xD;
row, an' a gold ticker flew out of his vest pocket, an' that Sn a gold chain, too.&#xD;
Well, says I, that's queerer than ever; that's. a d-n queer start, that is. You&#xD;
know you don't often see a man who wheels bricks sporting' a gold watch. I&#xD;
begun to think here was a case. How did a dead beat come by so much Jew-&#xD;
elry an' bullion? That's the question. So I staid by an' kept my eye on&#xD;
him. Well, next thing, a gentleman- come along who is in, our line, an' I&#xD;
piuted out this man to him, an' lie inspected him a while, an' finally reiem-&#xD;
bered him. Says he to me, That feller,-says lie, was up at New Haven time of&#xD;
the Wetherel murder; he was a-hangm' about the h use, says he, at the very&#xD;
time; I'll bet on him, says he. Well, that was a big thing, you know, that&#xD;
Wetherel murder, an' one of our men has been a-workin' it up ever since, an'&#xD;
wants all the items he can pick up. So I steps up to our friend here, an' says&#xD;
to him in substance, Coie along with me. Then he sassed me, an' I tobk him&#xD;
in charge. Well, here lle is--look at him yourself-disguised up to his ears--&#xD;
a little man dressed to look like a big one. We've took oil' more things from&#xD;
him than would clothe an alshouse. Just roll your eye around that haystack&#xD;
of coats an' trousers over there. Don't.it look queer? I leave it to yourself.&#xD;
Well, that's the story of the arrest; an' now, if there's anything' to say on the&#xD;
other side, I shall be glad-to hear it; for we don't want to bother no innocent&#xD;
man; of course we don't."&#xD;
During this tale John Bowlder had repeatedly attenl ted to introduce cor-&#xD;
rections, saying in a humble, placating voice, " My friend," but falling extinct&#xD;
under the strong utterance of .the " star."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETIIEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6242-00000100"/>&#xD;
"My friend," henow began again-"my official and much respected&#xD;
friend, you are very right in the main. But allow me, my friend, a word of&#xD;
explanation to my friend Lehming. I will tell you, Walter, how I came into&#xD;
this scrape. I had a desire to know by experience the pains and joys of the&#xD;
sons of toil. That is the reason why I sought a job at wheeling bricks. The&#xD;
agreement was a dollar for a day. The remuneration was low because I hon-&#xD;
estly avowed that I was a green hand at the bellows of labor. I did not wheel-&#xD;
well; I admit it, my official friend; but I wheeled the best I could. Even iny&#xD;
official friend here must concede that I whee~lad zealously."&#xD;
"Oh, of course," nodded the policeman impatiently. "But that's all pop-&#xD;
pycock, an' has nothin' to do with the case. I didn't arrest you for bad wheel-&#xD;
in'. You was a suspicious feller, an' you sassed me."&#xD;
"Yes, my official friend. I will confess somewhat of guilt in the matter&#xD;
of sauce," replied Bowlder. "I did call you a minion. The term is not&#xD;
savory; at least it is often used in an uncomplimentary sense; and I withdraw&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Well, now about the gold watch, an' the extry coats an! britches?" con-&#xD;
tinued the star, anxious to come to the main point. ' Who are you, anyway?&#xD;
Does this man," turning to Lehming, " know you? "&#xD;
Of course Lehming declared that lie was acquainted with Mr. Bowlder,&#xD;
and could bear witness to his entire respectability.&#xD;
"But who are you" .persisted the officer, too clever to, believe all he&#xD;
heard. " Look here, I can't let thisman go so easy as that, you know. .He'll&#xD;
have to wait here till we can send fbr the gentleman that's working up this&#xD;
Wetherel case. I say, Bill," lie called to a brother minister of justice, "tell&#xD;
some of them messen gers that Sweet is wanted."&#xD;
"You'll have to Maf round a spell," answered the brother minister of jus-&#xD;
tice with haughty indifference. "Jim is out on a circuit, an' it won't be easy&#xD;
to find him."&#xD;
"Oh, I know his hole;" said the first minister. And in a hoarse whisper&#xD;
lie named a grocery which stood directly opposite Lehming's lodgings.-&#xD;
So Jim was sent for. But presently Wolverton strolled in, also in search&#xD;
of Sweet, whom lie wanted to see;alhout Poloski. And now deliverance came&#xD;
to John Bowlder, for Wolverton was 'known to several of the officials, and his&#xD;
declaration as to the philosopher's respectability was accepted.&#xD;
"Dress as quickly as possible," urged Lehig. " I have a hack here and&#xD;
will take you home."&#xD;
"Walter, I will dress quickly,", snuffled Bowlder, who already had a cold&#xD;
in the head. "But I must go back to my wheeling. I want to clear my char-&#xD;
acter with those sons of toil who saw that minion take me into custody. Fur-&#xD;
thermore, I want to earn that dollar. It is my shamefaced impression that I&#xD;
never earned a dollar in my life. It is a sensation that I eagerly long for, as&#xD;
Galahad longed for a sight of the Holy Grail; and I cannot be balked in my&#xD;
search for it now that I am so near the goal. Go you, and ride in your luxu-&#xD;
rious hack; and if you took it on my account, charge it to me. I will devote'&#xD;

He had begun to recover his spirits, and also a tag or two of his transcen-&#xD;
dent phraseology. indeed, by the time that lie had got on his first layer of&#xD;
outer clothing, he broke out reciting, or perhaps improvising, some of his won-&#xD;
derful verses,-chanting them as usual to the tune that the cow died of.&#xD;
Lehming hurried to his hack, directedl his Jehu wvhither to drive next, and&#xD;
told Mrs. Dinneford the tale of Bowvlder's arrest. .Woi:ried and eager as she&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
was concerning the affair of Nestoria, the cheerful woman burst into one of&#xD;
her hearty fits of laughter.&#xD;
"Poor, good, foolish John!" she said. "I wonder what he was meant to&#xD;
do in this world. It does seem as if half the people we know ought to have&#xD;
been born in the moon."&#xD;
"But I told you, Walter, that this was a providence," she presently added&#xD;
with gravity. "You say that man Sweet was sent for. We shall be free to&#xD;
make our exits and entrances without a spy over us."&#xD;
CHAPTER LI.&#xD;
WILL SHE ESCAPE?&#xD;
MRs. DINNEFORD'S lively trust in Providence was not misplaced, nor her&#xD;
interpretation of its immediate purposes'erroneous.&#xD;
Detective' Sweet had really been summoned away from his ambuscade in&#xD;
front of the tenement house, and in fact Lehming caught a rear view of him,&#xD;
trudging in disguise, and through indirect streets, toward the Tombs.  Of&#xD;
course this was an emboldening spectacle; nothing heartens even a brave sol-&#xD;
dier like seeing the enemy in full retreat; and this excellent young man with&#xD;
a guilty conscience greatly needed cheering. He did not, however,'neglect&#xD;
any precaution against discovery. 'He halted his hack in the back alley, and&#xD;
manwuvred Mrs. Dinneford through the grocery and the courtyard, precisely&#xD;
as if Sweet were still at his post.&#xD;
"Dear me, Walter! one might think we were doing something wrong,"&#xD;
whispered that lady, with the adorable simplicity of a worthy soul which is ac-&#xD;
customed to judge its actions by its motives.&#xD;
Lehming envied lher uninstructed conscience, and marvelled over it. Hc&#xD;
had told her repeatedly that this thing which they were doing was illegal and&#xD;
perilous, without apparently gaining a spark of credence or rousing a throb of&#xD;
fear. Sle knew that she was right because her heart blazed up with love, pity,&#xD;
and other praiseworthy emotions, diffusing such a thick smoke of sweet in-&#xD;
cense that she could not see the solemn, inquisitorial figures of law and jus-&#xD;
tice. Without pausing to reason further with so convinced a spirit, Lehming&#xD;
led the way into the grim old tenement and panted up the long stairways.&#xD;
The door of his study was open, but the room was empty.&#xD;
"I will place you in this ambush," he said to Mrs. Dinneford, pointing out&#xD;
the closet which had once sheltered Nestoria from Edward Wetherel. "Then&#xD;
I will bring her in here and you shall step out upon her. It is dreadful and&#xD;
most degrading," he added with a groan, " to be obliged to resort to such de-&#xD;
ceptions."&#xD;
" Dreadful?" stared the worthy woman. " Why, Walter, it is all for the&#xD;
best, I am sure." And then, without further unnecessary justification of right-&#xD;
eousness, she rustled into the closet and seated herself cosily in the time-worn&#xD;
chair which still stood there. Falstaff, taking refuge behind the arras from&#xD;
Iis creditors, and snoring the snore of the upright, carried with him no quiet-&#xD;
er cnscience.&#xD;
Lehming now went out softly, as wicked men are fallaciously supposed to&#xD;
walk, and'as good men do walk when they are doubtful of their courses. He&#xD;
caine to Nestoria's door; there for a moment he paused, pressing his hand&#xD;
upon that complaining, threatening heart of his; at last he mustered resolution&#xD;
to tap upon the fateful panel. He heard a chair scrape on the bare floor with-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
<pb  n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6242-00000101"/>&#xD;
in, and knew that the little artist was rising from her work-table, and thought&#xD;
with compunction how trustfully-she would open to him. Next there was the&#xD;
sound of a bolt slipping back, and then Nestoria stepped briskly out with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
She was a beautiful object in his eyes, and she would have been beautiful,&#xD;
I doubt not, in the eyes of any man, or even of any woman. We must re-&#xD;
member her childlike figure, not merely as small but also as plump as child-&#xD;
hood, a figure like a cherub only half grown to be a seraph. This solidly.&#xD;
graceful young woman, notwithstanding months of anxiety, was now in the&#xD;
- richest health. She seemed able yet to endure anything that the youth of&#xD;
"teens " can endure. Her carnelian face was roseate; her locks of living sun-&#xD;
light were exuberant; her blue eyes were as clear as gems. There was some-&#xD;
thing fascinating in her candid manner and in her singularly fearless pose.-&#xD;
She stood square on both feet, her form perfectly erect and her head thrown a&#xD;
little back. This position was habitual with her, and very naturally so. She&#xD;
was so much shorter than most people, so much below the stature even of&#xD;
most women, that she usually had to look up in order to see faces; and fur-&#xD;
thermore, it was a characteristic of her confiding and brave nature that she&#xD;
hardly ever spoke to any one without looking him or her full in the eyes; so&#xD;
that this little head had learned to take and keep an upright carriage. Such&#xD;
a bearing would have made a tall woman appear haughty and domineering;&#xD;
but in this petite creature it only added to her air of innocence, of trustfulness,,&#xD;
of appealing for protection.&#xD;
" What is it, Mr. Lehming? " she asked in her frank, brief, practical way,&#xD;
at the same time giving him the confiding smile of an infant.&#xD;
His heart suddenly faced about and stepped into the paths of sincerity. He&#xD;
had meant to inveigle the girl unawares into a meeting with Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
But, loving her as he did, he could not look into those trustful eyes and keep&#xD;
his Jesuitical purpose.&#xD;
"My dear child, it is a -great deal," he said gently. "I have discovered&#xD;
that this house is watched-at least so I believe-by a detective. I decided&#xD;
that you must go otherwheres. The best friend that you have in this whole&#xD;
land is Mrs. Dinneford. I went to her. She is here, hiding in the closet in'&#xD;
nmy room, for I am sorry to say that I did mean to deceive you, meaning your&#xD;
good. She is here to take you away. Will you see her? "&#xD;
Nestoria turned pale, but her eyes retained their thoughtful composure,&#xD;
and she seemed entirely self-possessed.&#xD;
"Have you told her about me ?" she whispered. " Have you told her all&#xD;
that you krow P9"&#xD;
"Yes." he bowed meekly, not even asking forgiveness, he thought Aimself&#xD;
so unworthy of it.&#xD;
She bent her head a Moment, just a monimnt,- in meditation ; then she&#xD;
looked up at him with a smile of assent, satisfaction, and pardon. In the next&#xD;
breath she left him, walked with her usual firm, brisk step toward the study,&#xD;
entered it, face toward the closet, and said, "Mrs. Dinneford, you may come&#xD;
out."&#xD;
The good lady opened the door of her hiding-place, sawNestoria smiling&#xD;
at her, flew to her like a tempest, clasped her in' her arms, and cried with joy.&#xD;
When the two women drew back to look at each other, both their faces were&#xD;
quivering with emotion and wet with tears, although the younger one had not&#xD;
uttered a sob.&#xD;
"Oh, my dear little lost lamb!" exclaimed Mr's. Dinneford. " How you&#xD;
&#xD;
200&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
have borne and how you can bear! You are not changed a particle. You&#xD;
havp been in the furnace,. and the smell of fire is not upon you."&#xD;
4,I have learned to bear," sighed Nestoria, her voice shaking a little.&#xD;
"But do not let us talk of it-at least not now."&#xD;
No; there is no tiie for it," struck in Lehming. "Miss Bernard, how&#xD;
soon can you get away?"&#xD;
"In five minutes," she replied.&#xD;
"Leave the key of your room with me," he said. "I will see that your&#xD;
baggage is packed and sent after. you.&#xD;
"It is all packed but my brushes and colors," she smiled. "I have lived&#xD;
packed. In a minute I will bring out my carpet-b g."&#xD;
"I am so glad we brought your trunk to New  ork!" almost whimpered&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford, glancing pitifully at the girl's one well-worn dress. "You&#xD;
will find all your nice things at our house."&#xD;
"Come with me while I put on my bonnet and shawl," nodded Nestoria, as&#xD;
tranquilly as if she were about to prepare for a quiet promenade in open day.&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford followed this strange young heroine into her box of a room,&#xD;
and looked about it with moist eyes. There was the ugly, hired iron bedstead,&#xD;
the coarse, hired bedding, a single cherry chair, a small whitewood table, a&#xD;
washstand almost bald of varnish, no carpet, not a curtain, not a decoration of&#xD;
any sort, not a knicknack, none of those delicate comforts or small, gracious&#xD;
objects with which women love to surround themselves. For three months or&#xD;
so the girl had not expended one penny which had not been absolutely neces-&#xD;
sary to her mert existence. A few minute crumbs of sea biscuit on the man-&#xD;
telpiece showed what had been her nourishment that morning. Mrs. -Dinne-&#xD;
ford surveyed this confession of poverty, thought of the anxieties and sorrows&#xD;
under Which it had doubtless been endured, and then looked with wonder at&#xD;
Westoria's fresh cheeks and vigorous movements.&#xD;
" What a marvel of health and strength you are!" she murmured with&#xD;
something like awe&#xD;
" Yes," was the qlict reply. "I have been favored more than I deserve."&#xD;
"May the Lord sunder this sea of mystery," prayed Mrs. Dinneford, "and&#xD;
lead us all through it in peace, and restore~you to your uses in life !"&#xD;
Instantaneously startled and deeply moved by this impulsive petition, Nes-&#xD;
toria for a moment covered her face with her hands and sobbed aloud. Im-&#xD;
mediately recovering herself, however, she put on her well-worn hat and&#xD;
coarse- shawl, picked up her carpet-bag, and walked into the entry. Lehming&#xD;
was waiting there, meanwhile looking over the banisters.&#xD;
"I owe for the rest of the month on the room and furniture," she said to&#xD;
him, producing her purse. " Will you take -the money ?"&#xD;
" Time presses," he replied. "I will pay the bills and settle with you&#xD;
later."&#xD;
With that singular frankness which lay at the root of her character, and&#xD;
which still lived there in spite of months of concealment, she was about to de-&#xD;
scend the front stairway.&#xD;
"Nfot that way," called Lehming, at the same time seizing her carpet-bag.&#xD;
"We must use caution to-day.&#xD;
In two minutes more they had reached the back alley, and were driving&#xD;
rapidly away in their hack, the windows up and curtains drawn. Once Leh-&#xD;
migpeped out and beheld something which showed the value of minutes;&#xD;
he discovered detective Sweet hurrying back to his post, accompanied by a po-&#xD;
liceman.&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I fear that a search warrant has been issued," he said. "Well, we have&#xD;
the start, and New York is a wilderness, and our police is incapable. No one&#xD;
has seen us but the coachman. The keeper of the grocery must have been&#xD;
out."&#xD;
."I heard him in his cellar," remarked Nestoria. "He was just going down&#xD;
stairs as we entered."&#xD;
" We are surely in the right way," commented Mrs. Dinneford, with hon-&#xD;
est though perhaps erroneous thankfulness. " The finger of Providence aids&#xD;
us at every step. It is a pillar of cloud behind us. But, Walter, what will you&#xD;
do when they come to you?" .2.&#xD;
"I shall say to them: There is the room; search it."&#xD;
"Oh, how much trouble and perplexity I bring to you!" groaned Nestoria.&#xD;
"Well, some day-yes, some day-I will speak."&#xD;
There was not much said during the drive; they were too anxious to talk&#xD;
even of their anxieties. Once only Nestoria spoke, saying with a sigh, " Poor&#xD;
Imogen! She will be lonely, I am afraid. I wish I could have bidden her&#xD;
good by. What a life!"&#xD;
"It will end one happy day, one unexpected day," replied Lehming. "De-&#xD;
liverance, like calamity, often comes by surprise.'&#xD;
"Where are we going?" Mrs. Dinneford asked, seeing that they had passed&#xD;
the street leading to her house.&#xD;
"To the New Haven railroad station,". explained Lehming. " We must&#xD;
throw this coachman off the trail."&#xD;
On reaching the station (the old one on Twenty-seventh street) they dis-&#xD;
charged the lack and entered the station. Lehming bought three tickets to&#xD;
Boston, showed the ladies into a train which was about starting,-helped them&#xD;
out on the opposite side of the enclosure, led them through the long shed which&#xD;
opened on Madison avenue, and there took another carriage. Descending from&#xD;
this at a corner near the Dinneford house, they waited until it had disappeared,&#xD;
and then walked to their, refuge. Entering quietly by neians of a pass key,&#xD;
Nestoria was hurried up stairs to her bedroom; there to find a memento of Sea&#xD;
Lodge, her trunk.&#xD;
"Now dress yourself, dear, and don't cry!" exhorted Mrs. Dinneford,&#xD;
throwing herself into a chair and wiping her eyes. "I know the sight of the&#xD;
old things will give you a turn. But you must put on some different clothes.-&#xD;
It will be impossible to hide you from the servants, you know; and you must&#xD;
not look strange to them. They are curious enough when there's nothing to&#xD;
call for it. By the way, what a providence it was that we changed our help&#xD;
when we left Brooklyn. If we had kept the old set that Cousin Wetherel&#xD;
thought'-so much of, and used to discourse and expound to as though it was a&#xD;
congregation, we couldn't have brought you here on the spur of the moment.-&#xD;
They would have known you at the first glimpse, they thought so much of you&#xD;
and mourned so about you. You remember old Sarah, with the loose eyes that&#xD;
looked as though they had been dropped out and put back again. Well, Sarah&#xD;
is keeping an intelligence office; she thought she could do better that way,&#xD;
and it would be easier for her; and I knew it would be easier for me, for she&#xD;
had got very slatteri ly. But what am I talking to 'you about Sarah for?&#xD;
What's Hecuba to you? as Hamlet says, or something like it. I wonder wheie&#xD;
Alice is? I thought surely she would be here, ready to eat you alive. But&#xD;
perhaps she has-fun out to buy something that she thinks you will want.. Or&#xD;
perhaps she got fiightened about us, we were gone so much longer than )ve&#xD;
expected, and went to look for us. You know we women can't sit still when&#xD;

% HIDING, WATCHING, AND HALF- DISCERNING.&#xD;
"IT is I-let me in," called the voice of Alice Dinneford through the key-&#xD;
hole. " I have been shopping for her. Let me in."&#xD;
"Oh, ygn child, how you scared me!" exclaimed Mrs. Dinneford. Open-&#xD;
ing the door, she admitted a bounding, laughing young lady, who showed in&#xD;
her countenance not a trace of her late disappointment in love matters, who&#xD;
had forgotten completely the adventure of losingCount Poloski in the new ad-&#xD;
venture of recovering Nestoria, and who bore in her hand, of all winter pres-&#xD;
ents in the world, a gorgeous fan!&#xD;
"Oh, you darling!" she cried, embracing the restored pet. "Oh, you&#xD;
precious little speck of a thing! I had forgotten how little you were.. And&#xD;
your hair is lovelier than ever," she went on fingering it. "There, there is&#xD;
your present of welcome," she laughed, brandishing the fan. "Isn't it&#xD;
sweet?"&#xD;
"I painted it myself," quietly responded Nestoria, after one glance at the&#xD;
gewgaw. "I am glad you picked it oit for me. It seems as if you were led&#xD;
to remember me in a strange way. But how good of you to think of buying&#xD;
anything for me! Dear Alice, I thank you."&#xD;
"Life is just as full of special providences as it can stick," observed the&#xD;
wondering Mrs. Dinneford. "It is splendid with-them, like a bird with featL-&#xD;
ers. How beautiful and charitable it was of qur Heavenly Father to guide&#xD;
Alice, all unwitting of what she did, to buy a piece of your own handiwork as&#xD;
the fittest and loveliest gift she could find for you! As Tupper says, 'Is it not&#xD;
also His doing when an aphis creepeth on a rosebud?"&#xD;
Meantime the process of attiring continued. When it was finished, and&#xD;
Nestoria stood up fresh and trim in an unworn dress, with its suitable adorn-&#xD;
ments, she had gained in, beauty. , No wonder that women are dandies and&#xD;
love fine raiment; the dreariest economist must admit that it is becoming.&#xD;
Even Nestoria, almost an inhabitant of other worlds by reason of sorrows and&#xD;
concealments, remained so far human as that she could discern how much&#xD;
finer she was because of finer apparel. As she turned from the glass to her&#xD;
two friends there was an arch smile on her lips, which was partly a confession&#xD;
of satisfaction with her own appearance, and partly a grateful response to their&#xD;
looks of admiration. In truth they were inexpressibly exultant over their re-&#xD;
iiovated seraph. Mrs. Dinneford wanted to pick the girl up, and kiss her in&#xD;
her arms like an infant. Alice fluttered around her as a butterfly flutters&#xD;
around a flower. - Loving hands pulled and straightened the serious little al-&#xD;
&#xD;
the waves roll over us; it is so at the bathing places, and so everywhere; we&#xD;
must jump and scream. But yoig are different. What a wonder you are, to&#xD;
be sure, unlocking your trunk with that steady hand! I wish there were more&#xD;
women like you. The sex might be fit to vote then. Not that I want to vote&#xD;
any more than I want to whistle. Dear me, what talk this is! How my mind&#xD;
does canter about, like a colt in a pasture! Do let me help you on with that&#xD;
pretty- "&#xD;
At this moment there was a tap kt the door, rousing visions of detectives&#xD;
and policemen.&#xD;
"Who is it?" demanded Mrs. Dinneford, seizing the key with one hand&#xD;
and the bolt with the other, as if she really meant to shut out the law.&#xD;

paca skirt, and decked its puritanism with sash, ribbons, and other dashes of&#xD;
relieving finery. At last they all sat down, wearied with their excitements,&#xD;
and loved each other in quiet.&#xD;
But silence could not long prevail in a heaven upon earth populated mainly&#xD;
by Dinnefords. . Alice, a most curious young woman, and violently interested&#xD;
in mysteries, was wild to hear Nestoria's story. After looking at her with&#xD;
eager eyes for a few seconds, she broke out with, " And now tell us all about&#xD;
it. Do! You would feel so much better for telling us all about it!"&#xD;
No,' interposed Mrs. Dinneford,. as inquisitive as her daughter, but able&#xD;
through riper years to summon up some forbearance. "When Nestoria's con-&#xD;
science tells her to speak, she will do so. Until then we will wait."&#xD;
"You are very noble, Mrs. Dinneford," replied the girl, her eyes filling&#xD;
with sparkles of gratitude. "It seems to me of late- that everybody is sub-&#xD;
limely good or sublimely wicked. I never imagined human nature in such&#xD;
strong lights as I have-seen it in during the last three months. Once I thought&#xD;
there were few passions and no mysteries. Now everybody is terrible in my&#xD;
eyes; everybody is capable of something fearful. It is a very different world,&#xD;
and a much more awful world than I believed it."&#xD;
"Nestoria, how you have grown! " stared Alice. " Well, I have had to&#xD;
grow myself," she added with a sigh, remembering the Poloski folly. " I will&#xD;
tell you about it some day. But it's horrid, this growing."&#xD;
"We will gall you Nettie," said Mrs. Dinneford. "You shall be Miss Net..&#xD;
tie, and nothing more. If 'you will keep within doors, or wear a deep veil&#xD;
when you do go out, you will not be noticed, I hope. Walter thinks that the&#xD;
police will hardly take it into their wooden heads to look for you here."&#xD;
"These concealments! " sighed Nestoria. " Oh, these concealments! Well,&#xD;
I have almost done with them. If light does not come of itself soon, I will&#xD;
let it. I think I can promise you that I shall soon be - able to force myself to&#xD;
speak. In a month, at the longest. Yes, in a month."&#xD;
A woful tremor crisped the faces of all three women. Both Mrs. Dinne--&#xD;
ford and Alice said in their hearts that, when their guest should break silence&#xD;
concerning the Wetherel afflir, it would -be to denounce Edward Wetherel as&#xD;
the assassin of his uncle, or at least as privy to the assassination. No, it is iiot&#xD;
quite true that they said it; the thing seemed to be whispered to them, as by&#xD;
some goblin; and they, on their parts, strove hard to close their ears against&#xD;
the horrible suggestion.&#xD;
Thus commenced Nestoria's-life in the Dinneford house. It was a life of&#xD;
seclusion; she passed most of her time in her own room, painting, or reading,&#xD;
or chatting with her hosts; she hardly ever sat, even for a moment, in the&#xD;
parlor, and never went out except by evening. The servants knew no more&#xD;
of her than that here was a guest. It is reasonable to suppose that Lehming&#xD;
was the only person outside of the family who was aware of the girl's retreat.&#xD;
By the way, this gentle creature, unfitted through fragile health to cope&#xD;
with assailant fellow men of a rude and hearty morale, was graciously spared&#xD;
all difficulties with Mr. Sweet. The detective' did indeed search Nestoria's&#xD;
abandoned room, and was exceedingly miffed, even to blasphemy, at not find-&#xD;
ing her. But he was a dullish man, as has perhaps already been made ap-&#xD;
parent; he was no bloodhound, but rather a bulldog, with a poor nose for a&#xD;
scent.- le went at Imogen Eleonore about her missing friend with such petu-&#xD;
lant vim that she became more jealous than ever, and would not tell him what&#xD;
little she did know concerning Nettle Fulton. iThen he quarrelled with her,&#xD;
threatened her vaguely with the law, lost her confidence, scared her,-set-lier a-&#xD;

&#xD;
trying , and in short dampened his own train of powder, and lost all present&#xD;
chance of blasting open the Wetherel mystery. Strong and coarse, he under-&#xD;
took to drive a wonan, and almost of necessity failed.&#xD;
You can't drive a woman any more than you can drive a hen. She is too&#xD;
suspicious, timorous, hysterical, and when desperate, too wild. This way she&#xD;
dodges and that way she flutters, now,4naking, a rush between your legs, and&#xD;
then cut-cut-ca-da-cut over your shoulder, and away cackling into some un-&#xD;
traversable puddle, where she is badly off, to be sure, but you don't want to&#xD;
chase her. Well, Mr. Sweet was so bewildered by Imogen Eleonore's spas-&#xD;
modic ignorance and paroxysmal denials that he lost his faith in this Nettie&#xD;
Fulton as a key to his ".case," And decided that he had wasted his valuable&#xD;
time in watching the tenement-house. So, feeling that he had been somewhat&#xD;
ridiculous,.and not wishing to " make a cussed ass of himself " any further, he&#xD;
forbore from catechising Lehming, and in fact kept out of his way. Imogen&#xD;
Eleonore, we may as well add, he wrathfully- abandoned and left in uncourted&#xD;
desolation.&#xD;
'One word of explanation here concerning detectives. It may be imnagineF&#xD;
by some persons that I do injustice to this noble caste by presenting Mr. Sweet&#xD;
as an example of their abilities. I modestly but firmly, and sorrowfully also,&#xD;
believe the contrary. I believe that American detectives, and especially those&#xD;
of New York city, are usually models either of eminent dishonesty or of emi-&#xD;
uent incapacity.' Just consider the vast morasses and Pontine marshes of un-&#xD;
drained, uncleared crime, which send up their horrible malaria on the isl-&#xD;
and of Manhattan. Look at the Nathan murder and the long series o( other&#xD;
murders which are set down as so much " dead stock " on the police books of /&#xD;
that single municipality. Our assassins and. burglars are seemingly under as&#xD;
little restraint as if they were a legalized class, the representatives of a "vested&#xD;
interest," or an exceptional-judicature like the Holy Inquisition. Men whose&#xD;
every footstep leaves a trace of blood, and from whose pockets drop stolen&#xD;
bonds and greenbacks, walk under the noses of the men whose business it is&#xD;
to see them and catch them, with an insolent impunity which is enough to&#xD;
drive industry to other shores and make us rue our freedom. Of course .the&#xD;
fault in the matter rests on loftier heads than those of Mr. Sweet and his com-&#xD;
rades. A people which suffers itself to be rule )olitically by its non-taxpay-&#xD;
era, and which degrades its judiciary by making it look for power and honor&#xD;
to ward meetings and other similar sources of popular favor-such a people&#xD;
must necessarily have inferior magistrates and officers of justice, from the&#xD;
highest to the lowest.&#xD;
From this festering subject (which lends, by the way, a groundwork of prob-&#xD;
ability and even of naturalness to our story) we must return to Nestoria  She&#xD;
had not been a day in her new refuge before she had heard the tale of Alice's&#xD;
broken engagement. That frank'and sociable sufferer could not dam up her&#xD;
woes and fortifications. On the first opportunity she talked them out as&#xD;
freely as a swollen brook babbles forth its unaccustomed foam and "i-iliness."&#xD;
So Nestoria knew all about Count Poloski, and held him in fear and abonina-&#xD;
tion. She had disagreeable impressions even of his personal appearance. In&#xD;
spite of Alice's declaration that the man was slender, and blond, handsome,&#xD;
'hme pictured him as a stalwart creature of dark, saturnine, and forbidding .&#xD;
aspect. It must be remembered that she had seen him but once, and then only&#xD;
at a considerable distance and by moonlight. On the night when she had met&#xD;
Edward Wethere upon the beach tear Sea Lodge, the Count had been merely a&#xD;

black line rising from a dim profile of hillock against a background of moon-&#xD;

She learned that he was in the habit of passing the house frequently, oni the&#xD;
lookout, as it was supposed, for Alice. One lonesome day, while the Dinne-&#xD;
fords were out on one of those shopping ebullitions which serve to our ladies&#xD;
in place of the Eleusinian mysteries, or the weeping for-Tammuz, Nestoria&#xD;
placed herself at a window in the parlor and watched the passers by, wonder-&#xD;
ing whether she would recognize the discarded lover if she should see him.&#xD;
Unknown to her the chambermaid was polishing the door-plate and the door&#xD;
was open. The Count, who happened to be close at hand, bounded up the steps&#xD;
behind the woman, and, in spite of her hasty remonstrance, forced an entrance.&#xD;
Nestoria, gazing just then in another direction, did not witness this adroit&#xD;
and sudden escalade. The opening of a door and the sound of. a footstep in&#xD;
the parlor were her first intimations that a stranger was near her. She turned&#xD;
with a start of terror, and probably with an intent to fly; but the moment she&#xD;
oked in the visitor's face she seemed to be fascinated ; she stood stock still,'&#xD;
le, silent, and staring. Poloski did not know who she was, and at first took&#xD;
little note of her; he just glanced at her, and then glared about the room&#xD;
eagerly, undoubtedly seeking for Alice. His lost betrothed being nowhere&#xD;
visible, he turned once more toward.Nestoria, and then he seemed to observe&#xD;
the strange way in which shq gazed at him, for his eyes opened with an ex-&#xD;
pression of wonder and mistrust.&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, miss," he said, bowing civilly. "I regret that I have&#xD;
alarmed you by my intrusion. May I ask if Miss Dinneford is at home? "&#xD;
Nestoria did not answer, and continued to stare at him. She was evi-&#xD;
dently agitated by violent and conflicting emotions, and her appearance was&#xD;
very singular, startling, and even imposing. Her eyes were dilated and flash-&#xD;
ing; her face changed rapidly from white to crimson, and back again her&#xD;
very neck was blotched with crimson spots and streakings; all the blood in&#xD;
her veins was in wild tumult.&#xD;
" I demand to see Miss Dinneford, ' resumed Poloski,.evidently somewhat:&#xD;
confounded by this odd reception, but nevertheless resolved to carry his point&#xD;
if possible.&#xD;
"1Who are you? " asked Nestoria. Her utterance was as strange and ab-&#xD;
normal as her silence. The voice was not like hers; it was unnaturally harsh,&#xD;
strident, and abrupt; it seemed to burst violently through choking obstacles.&#xD;
"I am Count Poloski, at your service," replied the visitor, not forgetting&#xD;
his habitual civilities, though he was broadly amazed.&#xD;
"Oh!" gasped Nestoria in such a tone as rarely quivers through human&#xD;
speech, however often it may be heard in worlds of vaster emotions than ours.&#xD;
She was conscious of dizziness, of a humming and whirling of the whole room,&#xD;
of some one departing in a rapid, ghostly, inaudible way, and then of nothing&#xD;
more. The shock of a great hope, following on the shock of a great terror,&#xD;
had been more than she could bear without swooning.&#xD;
When she recovered her senses, she found herself laid upon a sofa, with&#xD;
the-chambermaid putting water to her lips, and no one else present.&#xD;
"9Was that Count Poloski?" were her first words, uttered in a faint voice,&#xD;
but very eagerly. " Why didn't you call the police?"&#xD;
The girl, who knew nothing against the Count except that he had been de4&#xD;
nied the house, stared in confusion and mumbled sonme vague excuses, '&#xD;
"Never mind," continued Nestoria. " I think I am well now. Help me&#xD;
to my room."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER LIII.&#xD;
THE WETHEREL WILL FOR SALE.&#xD;
WO or three days previous to Nestoria's adventure with Count Poloski,&#xD;
Walter Lehming had received a startling visit from Edward Wetherel.a&#xD;
The usually collected and serious, if not downright sombre young.nan was&#xD;
in a state of eager and cheerful exhilaration ; he came running up Lehming's&#xD;
stairway, rushed into his study without knocking, and tossed a billet to him&#xD;
with the words, " Read that."&#xD;
Walter glanced over the bit of manuscript, and saw that it was an anony-&#xD;
mous letter addressed to Mr. Edward Wetherel,,the writing in the fashion*&#xD;
pint, and the signature " Darkness."&#xD;
"The will exists," he read. "It cuts you off with a shilling. You can&#xD;
have it, if you will pay one hundred thousand dollars; otherwise it will be of-&#xD;
fered to the other heirs, who will'be sure to take it. If you accept, put an ad-&#xD;
vertisement in the 'herald,' saying, Terms agreeable, and signing your name.&#xD;
Then I will instruct you how to open further communication with me."&#xD;
As Lehming read, his long, sallow, homely, but sweet face flushed deeply,&#xD;
and, when he had finished he looked up at Edward with an expression of deep&#xD;
joy, a joy which he might not fully explain. If the letter were honest, if Ed-&#xD;
ward had not fabricated it himself (and Lehming did not think of that imme-&#xD;
diately), then it appeared certain that the murderer of Judge Wetherel was&#xD;
sonie commonplace, mercenary ruffian, and that this young man here present,&#xD;
this connection and friend, was innocent.&#xD;
"Here we have the assassin! " exclaimed Wetherel, pacing the room excit-&#xD;
edly and with countenance uplifted. "Here we have the bloody hand showing&#xD;
itself. The question is how to seize it."&#xD;
" Wonderful!" replied Lehming, with an intonation of profound gratitude.&#xD;
" But what is to be done? "&#xD;
"I cannot pay this money," continued Wetherel, halting with the bencled&#xD;
head and folded arms of reflection. "I am not the heir, if this document is&#xD;
found;'no, nor in any case. But I think' myself justified in promising it.&#xD;
Are we boundto keep the truth with murderers? Just think how easily this&#xD;
wretch has baffled justice thus far. The authorities of Connecticut gave up&#xD;
the search for him long ago, and I suppose wisely ; the criminal was no doubt&#xD;
beyond their jurisdiction before his crime was a day old. He came to New&#xD;
York at once; he came instantly and instinctively to this sink of undisturbed&#xD;
lawlessness; this letter proves almost positively that he is here to-day, and he&#xD;
has probably been here all the while. Yet for three months our force-as the&#xD;
police weakness sarcastically calls itself-has been pursuing him, or making&#xD;
a show of pursuit. For three months I have been urging and bribing our de-&#xD;
tectives and patrols to keep up the chase. Not a word have the drones, or&#xD;
idiots, or scoundrels brought me that has been worthy of attention."&#xD;
"You speak very strongly," said Lehming. " However, considering what&#xD;
you have suffered, I don't wonder. Any man in your situation would suspect&#xD;
a thousand things   "&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6242-00000105"/>&#xD;
208                  THE WETHElEL AFFAIR.&#xD;
"Yes, I do speak strongly," interrupted Wetherel. "I am embittered and&#xD;
enraged. I sometimes think that half our organization of justice, from the&#xD;
highest officials to the lowest, is in league with crime, or afraid of it. Just&#xD;
look at the Way things go in this single matter of homicide. No murderer is&#xD;
ever found out who shows forethought in his sin, or common prudence in hid-&#xD;
ing himself. And when a man is caught red-handed, he is not promptly and&#xD;
honestly tried, or he is not punished. There are nearly thirty assassins in our&#xD;
jails now, whom the law apparently dares not lay hands on, or covertly de-&#xD;
sires to save. It is uncivilized,ihorrible to all upright souls, terrifying to all&#xD;
good citizens. There is a paralysis of justice and of public morality. The&#xD;
individual is left unprotected; he must defend himself from crime by his own&#xD;
strength and cunning; he must do as he would in Calabria or the Isle of Miur-&#xD;
derers. He cannot afford scruples in dealing with the criminal classes. Much&#xD;
as I hate and despise deception, I must personallytell this villain a lie, and&#xD;
perhaps many lies, in the hope of entrapping him. I dare not -intrust the&#xD;
k to any one else, for fear that it will not be done faithfully and rightly, or&#xD;
n  done at all. All my confidence in the ability or the purity of our correc-&#xD;
tional system is gone. Besides, whatever else may happen, I must clear my&#xD;
own name. I must!" he added, with a passion of utterance which revealed&#xD;
long and acute suffering under the imputation of guilt.&#xD;
"Do as you must," said Lehming, after a pause of painful deliberation, for&#xD;
any and every fashion of falsehood was hateful to him. " When you have&#xD;
learned more, let me know if I can help you."&#xD;
So, under the pressure of what seemed relentless necessity, an advertise-&#xD;
ment of " worded deceiving'" was inserted in the " Herald, ' informing " Dark-&#xD;
ness " that his terms were agreeable. Then came another letter; it offered a&#xD;
meeting, but not with Wetherel; some less formidable messenger must be&#xD;
sent, bearing the money; the place- indicated was a wharf near the Battery,&#xD;
and the hour three in the, morning.&#xD;
"I will go," volunteered Lehming, after Edwai-d had read the note to&#xD;
him. "But what about the filthy lucre? What sort of ghost or simulacrum&#xD;
of it can I carry? I must have something to hold in my hands while I talk&#xD;
with this wretch and try to divine who lie is."&#xD;
"Counterfeit bills would answer best," muttered Edward. " They could&#xD;
be got from the police for this purpose. But it is horrible pitch to touch lor&#xD;
any purpose."S&#xD;
"oLet me have a simple package of xiraste paper," said Lehming. " I can&#xD;
do something with it. I can at least make sure that there is a man-at the end&#xD;
of this mysterious correspondence. Besides, there are possibilities. Chance&#xD;
may favor me. I may recognize him, may follow him, may bring about an&#xD;
arrest. Of course I can do nothing in the way of seizing him myself. 'You&#xD;
know I can neither fight. nor run. But Providence may help. At the very&#xD;
least something will be gained. I shall be able to testify to a fact which will&#xD;
go to show-your innocence."&#xD;
' To think that it should need showing!" groaned Wetherel. "But I&#xD;
thank you. Only, do you consider that you risk violence? This may be a&#xD;
mere trick to delude a man with money about him into a place where he can&#xD;
be waylaid. This fellow, too, when he finds that the package is a fraud, may&#xD;
"ssaull li.eave my watch and wallet at home," replied Lehming. " As foi&#xD;
my poor little carcass, it is not of much account, and I will risk it. Sonie onc&#xD;
must go."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        209&#xD;
So Lehming went, enveloped in an old loose cloak, and carrying under it&#xD;
a large sealed package, which had such a preposterously overt air of sham-&#xD;
ming great value that he was more than once tempted to throw it away. He&#xD;
started at two in the morning, for hiehad of course decided that he must go on&#xD;
foot to, the rendezvous, and the preliminary throbbing of his anxious heart&#xD;
told hin that he would not be able to walk fast. The streets were deserted,&#xD;
even brawlers and drunkards having sought refuge within doors from the keen&#xD;
December air; and as he looked up and down the long avenas of silence,&#xD;
.ordered by monstrous walls which threw out not a gleam of light, he had an&#xD;
impression as if he were traversing a necropolis. The only persons whom he&#xD;
met were two or three isolated and nomadic policemen, who seemed to be en-&#xD;
gaged in trying doors to see if they were locked. "I ani doing their work for&#xD;
thei," he thought somewhat bitterly, and passed them by without asking for&#xD;
their assistance.&#xD;
By times his mind leaped forward to the interview which awaited him, and&#xD;
sought to fashion it into some shape which would be manageable to his powers.&#xD;
His vivid imagination enabled him to struggle painfully with incidents which&#xD;
had not yet happened, and-to take anxious part in a dialogue which might&#xD;
never be spoken. He was in the condition of a man who plays a game of&#xD;
chess in his thoughts, striving to arrange an interminable series of moves in&#xD;
such a fashion as to make them sure of success against every imaginable coun-&#xD;
terplay, and fighting with an ativersary who has even the unknown to aid him,&#xD;
but who yet must be beaten. His game worked badly ; he was not fitted for&#xD;
the fencing of intrigue and for encounters with ruffians; and, knowing his own&#xD;
weakness-in such matters, he could not fancy himself as getting the better of&#xD;
his antagonist. His supposititious controversies with the mysterious villain of&#xD;
the Battery all ended, no matter how often he recommenced them and how&#xD;
eagerly he bent his mind to them, in discomfiture. The incognito wormed out&#xD;
secrets and divulged none; he secured the sealed package and discovered it&#xD;
to be a sham; he failed to exhibit the will, and successfully hid his guilty&#xD;
visage. Wearied at last with these confusing and disheartening forereachings,&#xD;
Lehming struggled to clear his brain of them and to trust that the trial would&#xD;
bring him inspiration.&#xD;
"I will do the best I can," he murmured. "And may Heaven help me,&#xD;
as it sometimes does help the foolish."&#xD;
Then another troublous subject gradually invaded his mind, like a tide&#xD;
stealing over a low and dikeless land, driving out of it all present life and con-&#xD;
firming the future as a waste. He was engaged in an enterprise which, if&#xD;
completely successful, would prove the innocence of Edward Wetherel; and&#xD;
one result, one morally certain result, of such a rehabilitation would be to give&#xD;
Nestoria back to her betrothed lover. He himself felt sure of it, and that&#xD;
surety was a dagger to him. He knew now, if he had never known it before,&#xD;
that he loved the girl with all his heart and mind and strength. She had&#xD;
never yet seemed to him, and indeed we might also say that she had never&#xD;
really been, so beautiful, so sweet in her ways, so noble and pure and alto.&#xD;
gether charming, as she appeared to his imagination in this momentous hour&#xD;
when he was doing his feeble best to hand her over to another. He reniem.-&#xD;
bered her smile-that tender starlight sparkle which had so often transmitted&#xD;
to him messages of gratitude and friendship, and which had sometimes lighted&#xD;
up- the dusky abysses of his humility with glimmers of trembling hope. He re-&#xD;
called her various expressions, her thoughtful face, her sorrowful face, her&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6242-00000106"/>&#xD;
21.0&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
face of cheer, her rare face of gayety, all her faces, all familiar to his soul, all&#xD;
capable of appearing before his mind's eye at an instant's summons, or with-&#xD;
out a summons. His meditations concerning her were not philosophical, nor&#xD;
hardly intelligent. They were vision and emotion; he saw and felt, rather&#xD;
than thought.&#xD;
It was a farewell. He gave her up; he sacrificed himself, as he was accus-&#xD;
tomed to do; he walked onward the quicker in order to hasten the sacrifice.&#xD;
It was a most sorrowful struggle, and every moment or two his eyes tookdes-&#xD;
perate flights toward heaven in search of strength to bear it, dropping back&#xD;
wearily to earth with no other help than .a suffering sense of resignation. .An&#xD;
angel passing by might have seen a human dwarf striving to rejoice in the&#xD;
hope that he was working out good and happiness for others, and meanwhile&#xD;
wiping the tears from his cheeks. In this dolorous and sublime hour of re-&#xD;
nunciation he would not forbid himself tears. He must have that feeble con-&#xD;
solation, and he felt that he was worthy of it. It was surely not much to ob-&#xD;
tan, but he thanked God for it, so humble was he. "Oh, merciful Father,"&#xD;
he whispered, " thanks, thanks, for tears! "&#xD;
Perhaps a man is never so worthy of a woman as when; for her betterment&#xD;
and in spite of the pleadings of his heart, he resigns her to another. The very&#xD;
grief and meekness with which he lets go all claim to her brings him near to&#xD;
that divine ideal of love which renders all and requires nothing. Lehming,&#xD;
always purer of egoism than most human beings, was just now nearly fit, one&#xD;
may dare to say, for translation.&#xD;
Meanwhile his thoughts devoured the long way, as if they had been a cha-&#xD;
riot of fire; and of a sudden he was surprised by discovering that he had&#xD;
reached the Battery. The dark open space, snowless as yet and lighted by&#xD;
few lamps, its apparent size increased by the breadth of the invisible river be-&#xD;
hind it, seemed to him at first a daunting desert to approach. He paused a&#xD;
moment, wondered whether he should be waylaid, and then once more set for-&#xD;
ward steadfastly. Reaching the iron fence which then surrounded the Battery,&#xD;
and which by night was closed to prevent scenes of disorder and dramas of crime,&#xD;
he turned to the right and soon found the place ofrendezvous. It was a small&#xD;
open wharf, bare at the time of all lumbering of merchandise, and of course&#xD;
jutting out into the sombre expanse of the North river. As he glanced along&#xD;
its dim edge, feebly illuminated by a single lamp, he could at first see nothing&#xD;
but ghostly outlines of shipping in the stream and a few distant lurid gleams&#xD;
which indicated the position of Jersey City.&#xD;
" This man means to sail to-morrow for Europe," he said to himself as'he&#xD;
halted. "But will he come?""&#xD;
Yes, he had come; there was' a figure lying on the extreme verge of the&#xD;
wharf; and, as Lehming approached, it rose to an erect position.&#xD;
CHAPTER LIV.&#xD;
THE MASK TOR' OFF.&#xD;
THE man who rose from the edge of the wharf to meet Lehming was wrap-&#xD;
ped in a long, loose overcoat, furnished with a hood or capote which covered&#xD;
his head and shadowed his visage."&#xD;
Lehming did not recognize him; he could simply see that he was a tall .&#xD;
man-about as tall as Wetherel; all other peculiarities of figure were shrouded&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
'.&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
211&#xD;
&#xD;
and disguised by that voluminous garment. Presently, too, as the unknown&#xD;
turned his face a little toward the wharf lamp, he perceived that that face was&#xD;
masked. The mask was a commonplace, grotesque affair, such as may be&#xD;
seen grimacing unchangeably through any toyshop window, and such as chil-&#xD;
dren buy to scare smaller comrades with. The nose was prodigious, the color&#xD;
of the lumpish cheeks was gross and glaring, and the huge mouth was moulded&#xD;
to counterfeit a clownish laugh. There was something preteinaturally horrible&#xD;
in the contrast between this leering, smirking simulacrum and the supposed&#xD;
homicidal character of its wearer.&#xD;
When within six or eight feet of the figure Lehming halted, and asked in a&#xD;
voice which he could not quite steady, " Is this Darkness?"&#xD;
"Yes," replied the other. The utterance, like the shape, was unrecogniza-&#xD;
ble. There was now a moment of silence during which Lehming rallied his&#xD;
thoughts and his strength for fresh speech, meanwhile listening to the lapping&#xD;
of the waters at the base of the wharf, and noting also a dull, faint thumping&#xD;
as of a boat beating against the timbers. "I come to you," he resumed, "from&#xD;
Mr. Edward Wetherel."&#xD;
"Very well," responded the mask. There i as no doubting or questioning;&#xD;
the speaker had the air of being quite sure of the authenticity and good faith&#xD;
of Lehiming; it seemed probable that he might have recognized him.&#xD;
" Have you the papef?" asked the dwarf, after another pause.&#xD;
"What paper? " was the cautious answer.&#xD;
Lehming, after pondering a moment over this reticence, inferred from it&#xD;
that he must-fully state his business, or the other would make no disclosures.&#xD;
"I was sent here," he said; " to receive from you the will of Judge Jabez&#xD;
Wetherel, which you agreed to surrender to his nephew for one hundred thou-&#xD;
sand dollars."&#xD;
"It is here," replied the stranger, slightly touching his breast. with one&#xD;
hand, while the mask .nodded and leered its immutable grimace, as if it were&#xD;
some Meiphistophelean spectator of the drama who scoffed and sneered.at the&#xD;
two human actors.&#xD;
Will you let me see the will-merely to make sure that you have it? '&#xD;
asked Lehminmg.&#xD;
T he goblin visor shook a slight negative, and the hollow voice beneath&#xD;
it muttered: "I must first see the money."&#xD;
There was a long and troubling silence, broken only by the swashing of&#xD;
the ripples and the thumping of the unseen boat-tyo sounds which were very&#xD;
strange as being audible on the verge of a great city, and very disquieting ag&#xD;
suggesting easy homicide and the secure escape of the criminal. The disguised&#xD;
man did not turn; the boat behind and below him was evidently his and no&#xD;
other's; at least, so he believed. Had he turned, lie would have seen some-&#xD;
thing to give him alarm; he would have seen a face peering over the edge.&#xD;
beam, with its eyes fixed on him. Lehming, while fumbling with his sealed&#xD;
package and debating whether he should hold it forth, chanced -to discover&#xD;
this head. At first he thought that the mask had a comrade there, and in his&#xD;
nervousness he involuntarily recoiled a pace. But in the next breath he sa w&#xD;
a hand rise before the mysterious head, with one finger laid across the lips, as&#xD;
if enjoining silence. Then it occurred-to, him that perhaps the police were at&#xD;
hand; that Wetherel might have thought it best to advise them of the inter-&#xD;
view; that somehow or other justice had stumbled upon the trail of this mis-&#xD;
doer. At all events a crisis had come, and he must do his best to help it for-&#xD;

&#xD;
ward; he must engage the attention of the mask to keep him from turning&#xD;
to see his peril. So he handed out his fraudful bundle, at the same time sav-&#xD;
ing in a louder voice than he had yet used, "Where is the will?"&#xD;
"I must look at this first," returned the unknown, beginning to tear off the&#xD;
sealed envelope. It was natural enough'that he should doubt whether a hun-&#xD;
dred thousand dollars had been brought him in the night by an unattended&#xD;
dwarf; only a very idiot of a rogue would believe in such an Arabian Nights&#xD;
adventure without ocular evidence of its actuality. He moved a little nearer to&#xD;
the wharf lamp, and continued to unroll the package with hands that shook&#xD;
quite visibly, his visor meanwhile grinning its hideous paper gratulation. Mean-&#xD;
time the head behind him changed to a full figure, which stealthily grew up&#xD;
on the extreme verge of the wharf, whatever noise it made being drowned by&#xD;
the lapping of the water. Lehming, tried not to look at it, for fear of warning&#xD;
the mask. He felt sure now that a policeman, or perhaps a party of the police,&#xD;
had watched the outgoings of this criminal and followed him to the rendezvous.&#xD;
In great trepidation, and dreading by moments lest his throbbing heart should&#xD;
beat him to the earth senseless, he dropped his eyes and awaited the result.&#xD;
Slowly. with a deliberation indeed which seemed to risk all chance of sue-&#xD;
dess, but steadily and without a sound that could reach the ear, the stranger&#xD;
moved toward the mask until he was within less than ten feet of him. Then&#xD;
he sprang, and instantly there was a furious struggle between the two, the one&#xD;
striving to escape and the other to hold fast, and both gasping out short, hard&#xD;
breaths loaded with curses. Lehming saw a sparkle between them as of drawn&#xD;
steel, but could not distinguish which grasped it, nor whether a blow was&#xD;
struck. Fearful, however, that the policeman would be hurt or overcome, he&#xD;
advanced to give him aid. But at this moment a new figure appeared on the&#xD;
scene, climbing up the dock and running toward the combatants. Lehming&#xD;
had just time to notice that this man, like the first, was not in police garb, but&#xD;
wore a short shaggy box-coat and slouched hat, when he heard some one mut-&#xD;
ter, as if through clenched teeth, "Upset that little fellow!" Almost instan-&#xD;
taneously, and before he could think what the phrase meant, the last arrival&#xD;
gave him a fisticuffs which laid him prostrate. It was a terrible blow; it be-&#xD;
reft him of consciousness.                     '&#xD;
When he came to himself some time must have elapsed, for all was quiet&#xD;
He lay still upon the wharf, just where he had fallen, with the lamp dimly shin-&#xD;
ing in his eyes. He was chilled through; his cloak had been thrown open, as&#xD;
if to examine his clothing, and, as he afterwards discovered, his pockets were&#xD;
turned inside out. Raising himself on one elbow, and lifting his bruised, ach-&#xD;
ing, dizzy.head, he looked about him. At a little distance lay what seemed a&#xD;
corpse. It was the man with the capote.&#xD;
He rose, tottered toward this man, knelt by his side, and surveyed him at-&#xD;
tentively. The leering, grinning mask was still on the face, giving a horrible&#xD;
air of farce to this homicidal tragedy. It was not, however, fastened there,&#xD;
but had evidently fallen off or been torn off, and then carelessly replaced, per-&#xD;
hpps in mockery. Lehming gently removed this painted ghost of hilarity,&#xD;
and stared at the uncovered visage with an amazement which nearly drowned&#xD;
his horror.&#xD;
"Edward!" he exclaimed. "No, it is Poloski."&#xD;
Yes, the dead man who lay there, the man who had volunteered to surrender&#xD;
the will of the murdered Judge Wetherel, was certainly Poloski.&#xD;
" It is the finger of God," continued Lehming, impressed by that wonder&#xD;
&#xD;
212&#xD;
&#xD;
and awe, and that instinctive, impulsive belief in the supernatural, which are&#xD;
apt to descend upon us when we do happen to see a great crime followed by&#xD;
remarkable punishment.&#xD;
Now all is explained," he resumed after a moment. "Nestoria mistook&#xD;
this man for Edward. Ah, well, she will be happy. -,He is innocent."&#xD;
Meantime, he was gently opening the large coarse overcoat which envel-&#xD;
o ed the fallen figure. A moisture on his hands arrested his attention, and&#xD;
them to the light, he saw stains of blood. Then, looking closely, he&#xD;
discovered in the clothing the clean-cut rents of stabs-several stabs, one of&#xD;
then close to the heart, if not penetrating it.&#xD;
"What does this mean?" he exclaimed, looking fearfully around him.&#xD;
" Why should the detectives leave us here? "&#xD;
He had already searched in vain for Poloski's pulse with his chilled and&#xD;
glassy fingers. He warmed and softened them between his lips, and renewed&#xD;
his groping for signs of vitality. There was no movement--yes, there was a&#xD;
feiule, uncertain fluttering; or was it the beating of his own blood? Lehming&#xD;
feared this man, abhorred him, and almost revolted from touching him; yet&#xD;
he bent over him with an intense eagerness to see him live, dragging at him&#xD;
in spirit, one might say, to get him up the slopes of death.  And Poloski still&#xD;
had breath in him ; after some minutes he opened his eyes. It was the first&#xD;
time that Lehming had ever had the .gaze of a vitally injured man fixed on&#xD;
his face; and he trembled all over, every fibre of his flesh seemed to quiver&#xD;
and crawl, with an agonizing thrill of pity.&#xD;
Shall I gc and bring help? "lhe whispered, stooping close to the sufferer.&#xD;
Poloski did not at once reply lJbut it was probably not because he did not&#xD;
understand; for even a mortally wounded man does not become delirious&#xD;
until fever arrives; at first, if he has his consciousness, he has his reason.&#xD;
This man's silence sprang mainly no doubt from weakness, though partly also,&#xD;
it may be, from fear. Who that Lehming would seek would be likely to&#xD;
bring Polaski help, or fail to bring him further harm?&#xD;
"Yes-go," he said at last, in a faint gurgle, at the same time turning his&#xD;
eyes toward the city.&#xD;
Lehmiug rose and set off in the direction of the Battery; trusting that there&#xD;
he might find a policeman, -should accident favor. he ought of course to have&#xD;
secured the will first, but in his tenderness for this suffering and seemingly&#xD;
dying fellow creature he had not attempted to rummage for it, if indeed he&#xD;
had not temporarily forgotten it. Poloski, faint as he doubtless was, remem-&#xD;
bered it only too well; he had the presence of mind, resolution, and hardness&#xD;
of the practised criminal. The moment he was left alone he thrust his hand&#xD;
slowly inside his blood-stained vest, broke open a loosely stitched, seam with&#xD;
his numbed fingers, and drew forth the document. -His strength was as yet far&#xD;
from gone. A man may be terribly lacerated and still retain much muscular&#xD;
force. I have knownr}a soldier, who had fallen unconscious with a minia ball&#xD;
through his lungs, to recover his senses and run a hundred yards or. more for&#xD;
covert, there to fall again in a swoon. So Poloski, with five stabs- in his body,&#xD;
two of them sure to be fatal, was able not only to secure this paper, but to&#xD;
mangle it with his teeth.&#xD;
But the work of destruction was not completed when Lehming reappeared;&#xD;
he had recollected the will and he came running to save it. Terrible as such&#xD;
a struggle must have been to him, he seized the wounded man's quivering&#xD;
hands and wrenched from them the bloody fragments.&#xD;
&#xD;

214                  THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
I have-ruined you," whispered Poloski, with a ghastly grimace which&#xD;
strove to be a smile. "You-and those cursed-Dinnefords. You-shall have&#xD;
-nothing."&#xD;
Thank Heaven!" replied Lehming with honest gladness. "It is as it&#xD;
should be. Justice has been done by hands most strangely called to it."&#xD;
Poloski stared at him; but the stare was that of a fading consciousness; he&#xD;
was once more swooning. His eyes had scarcely closed when new actors ap-&#xD;
peared upon the scene. As Lehming was gathering up and putting into his&#xD;
pockets the smaller tatters of the will he heard footsteps advancing rapidly&#xD;
down the wharf, and presently saw two men enter the circle of light about him.&#xD;
One of them was Edward Wetherel and the other detective James Sweet.&#xD;
" You are alive then!" exclaimed Edward, joyfully. "I have suffered&#xD;
horrors about you. It was a foolish plan and a foolish risk. I could not help&#xD;
coming to see what had happened. But," and, here he glainced at the pros-&#xD;
trate Poloski, ' what'is that?"&#xD;
" Jiminy! it's the Poloski chap!" exclaimed Sweet, who had already dis-&#xD;
covered the body and coolly squatted himself to inspect it. " And hain't he&#xD;
been skewered. though? I say, Mr. Lehming, but you've had a.busting' old&#xD;
time with him," he added, glancing with wonder and admiration at the little&#xD;
inan, whom he regarded as the conqueror of Poloski in single combat.&#xD;
"I was talking with.him when--" Lehming began to explain. Then he&#xD;
turned to Wetherel and whispered rapidly, "lHe tore up the will, liut I iave&#xD;
the pieces. I was talking with him," he resumed aloud, " when some men&#xD;
climbed up over the wharf and assaulted him, knocking me down and going&#xD;
off before I recovered. I had an idea that they were police or detectives."&#xD;
"Detectives? " interrupted Sweet. "The devil!" he at once argued ad-&#xD;
versely.  " Detectives wouldn't cut him up that way and then leave him;&#xD;
they'd want the rewards. Some of his own private friends done this-some&#xD;
of Riley's gang most probably-bet you what you like it was Riley's gang-go&#xD;
you my whole pile on it. What's he got in his mouth?" he continued, turn-&#xD;
ing once more to the pallid face under his elbow. " It's a piece-of paper, by&#xD;
Jove! He's been tryin' to swallow it."&#xD;
Inserting his horny fingers into Poloski's moth, he unlocked the teeth with&#xD;
some difficulty, extricated a tattered scrap of paper, and held it up to the light.&#xD;
"Look here!" he went on; " this concerns 'you gents. - There's Wetherel&#xD;
on this."&#xD;
",Jabez Wetherel? "- asked both Edward and Lehming, as they eagerly&#xD;
bent over him. "No," added the former.  " Only Wetherel, and not the&#xD;
whole of that. The signature is destroyed."&#xD;
"Tie signature!" exclaimed Sweet, aghast with sudden comprehension.&#xD;
" What! was this the will? The Wetherel will? And Poloski had it? Then&#xD;
he was the murderer. So that was what this night's business was about. Oh,&#xD;
Mr. Wetherel! you've played it rough on me. You've cut me out of the re-&#xD;
wards. You brought me here, an' kep' me a-waitin', an' never told me a thing&#xD;
when I could a caught the man.",&#xD;
"I only brought you because I accidentally met you," replied Wetherel, a&#xD;
little moved by this naive groan of distress, wrenched from the detective's in&#xD;
most pocket. "You had failed completely so far. Never mind. You shall be&#xD;
well paid."&#xD;
Somewvhat comforted, Mr. Sweet touched Poloski with his boot and fell to&#xD;
moralizing. " So this is the way the world goes, is it? Accident is the Boss-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                       .215&#xD;
Here is the Wetherel Case, what I've been workin' at for three months and&#xD;
more, bust open all, by itself. Police ain't nowhere. Detectives don't count.&#xD;
Justice takes the back seat. Well," he sighed, facing about upon Lehming,&#xD;
"you are a lucky customer. You git the swag, I s'pose. A round twenty&#xD;
thousan'! By jimmy, some fellows hit it, aim where they will! " he sighed&#xD;
again, surveying the misshapen, heavy-laden Lehming with really pathetic,&#xD;
envy.&#xD;
The dwarf might have said, "I have lost a quarter of. a million, and lost it&#xD;
gladly," but he did not say it, nor think of it. He turned to Edward and&#xD;
asked anxiously, " Can you tell whether this man is still living? "&#xD;
"4I think not," hesitated Wetherel, seeking in vain with his chilled fingers&#xD;
for Poloski's pulse. .'6I cannot be sure yet, but he seems to me dead."&#xD;
Lehming shuddered. "Without one call to preparation ! " he thought;&#xD;
" why (lid I not utter it? "&#xD;
.oAn instant later, worn out with the labor, hardship, and anxiety of this&#xD;
tragedy which was now over, he sat down on the rimy planks of the wharf, very&#xD;
faint.&#xD;
"hurry off and get a hack," said Wetherel to Sweet. "He must be taken&#xD;
home."&#xD;
CHAPTER LV.&#xD;
FACE TO FACE.&#xD;
IT was a long time before Lehming awoke from his swoon, and when he&#xD;
did recover his senses he found himself exceedingly weak, as if lie had barely&#xD;
escaped from the strangling coil of death.&#xD;
But he was in good hands, for he .had been carried to the house of Mrs.&#xD;
Dinneford, and that tender mother in Israel had had him put to bed, and was.&#xD;
now watching over him.&#xD;
"There, go to sleep again," were the first words that he heard on opening&#xD;
his-eyes. "You can't do better than sleep."&#xD;
"Yes-I can do better," he whispered after a minute of vacant gazing,&#xD;
during which his memory of the past and his full intelligence of the present&#xD;
returned to him. "Where is Nestoria?"&#xD;
"Must you see her now?" objected Mrs. Dinneford, not in the least guess-&#xD;
ing how much the girl was to him, but merely judging him unfit for conversa-&#xD;
tion with any one. "Are you sure tltyou can bear it? "&#xD;
"I can bear it best now," murmured Lehming, his mind fixed on the fact&#xD;
that lie must surrender Nestoria to Edward, and feeling that he could do it&#xD;
easiest in this hour of weakness, which was so near to unconsciousness.&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford went out, but almost immediately returned, leading the&#xD;
girl by the arm and prattling cheerfully: "She was just dressed, and bent on&#xD;
seeing you."&#xD;
Nestoria came up to the bedside in her quiet, quick way, took Lehming's&#xD;
hand, and whispered, "My poor, dear friend!&#xD;
"I have found the will," he said at once, while something like a tear glis-&#xD;
tened in his eyes. "Poloski had it."&#xD;
"He was the murderr" added Nestoria. Lehiming looked up at her with&#xD;
surprise, she had spoken so promptly'n asrdy.&#xD;
"I saw him yesterday," she continued. "I thought he wvas Edward-Mr.&#xD;
Wetherel. When I found that lhe was not Mr. Wether'el I felt sure that he&#xD;
must be the murdererr"&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6242-00000109"/>&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"And you had believed Edward guilty? " asked Mrs. Dinneford.&#xD;
Nestoria fell upon her knees, buried her face in the bedclothes, and sobbed&#xD;
violently, exclaiming from time to time, "Oh, what injustice!"&#xD;
"I saw him by night," she went on after a while. "And they do surely re-&#xD;
semble each other. I thought he was Edward. I was sure of it. But, oh,&#xD;
what injustice! I can never forgive myself. He never can forgive me. No&#xD;
man could forgive such an imputation. And from me especially, who was&#xD;
bound to believe in him, and had promised to trust him!. Oh, it is unpardona-&#xD;
ble! And I was all wrong-wrong all the way through. I have been wrong&#xD;
in concealing this thing. I should have spoken; I should have told what I&#xD;
knew-or thought I knew. Then there might have been an explanation. The&#xD;
truth might have come to light long ago. What misery I have made for my&#xD;
self and others by disobeying my conscience! I shall never be forgive .&#xD;
either on earth or in heaven."&#xD;
" We have all been wrong," whispered Lehming; venturing to put his sal-&#xD;
low hand on her sunny head. "My hiding of you was wrong. My not insist-&#xD;
ing with you for an immediate divulgence of the truth was wrong. It was of&#xD;
a piece with the general lack of proper feeling in Anierica toward crime. I&#xD;
have done what soft-hearted people do who sign petitions for mercy to assas-&#xD;
sins, I have done what unfaithful policemen and jurymen and judges and&#xD;
governors do. I have sought, with a false and unwiseand sinful pity, to shield&#xD;
sin from punishment. Even when I fully believed Edward to be guilty, I&#xD;
wanted to save him from the gallows, or at least to put off justice. We have&#xD;
been wrong, and I more than all, for I knew it. It has turned out well, but&#xD;
not through our merits-only through the compassion of God. But as He has'&#xD;
benignly directed, so I trust that Ile will patiently pardon."&#xD;
"How can wve doubt the infinite mercy?" broke in cheerful, confident Mrs.&#xD;
Dinneford, always ready to be a medium for heavenly revelations, especially&#xD;
those of a comfortable character. "Haven't we been already guided and de-&#xD;
livered in the most wonderful, long-suffering, salvatory, reassuring, convinc-&#xD;
ing manner? What might have happened to us but for these gracious deal-&#xD;
ings? What if that murderer had been permitted to carry away Alice to some&#xD;
of his dens of blood? But Apollyon was beaten there, and at every point; and&#xD;
those who combated him have been brought through victorious, in spite of&#xD;
their errors; and they will have undeserved forgiveness as surely as they have&#xD;
had undeserved succor. And as for you two little creatures falling into ag-&#xD;
onies of remorse about what has befallen, why it is certainly the most exti'aor-&#xD;
dinary sight that I ever beheld in my life. I should as soon expect to hear&#xD;
two pet lambs go to groaning over their sins because the wolf had killed the&#xD;
watchdog. In my humble opinion, if our Heavenly Father had no worse chil-'&#xD;
dren than you, it would be a very respectable family. Of course, I don't want&#xD;
to encourage you to boast yourselves in the face of the divine perfection. As&#xD;
Tupper says, Humility mainly becometh a man in converse with his Malker.&#xD;
But there is such a thing as a child of Adam dealing over-strictly with him-&#xD;
self, and holding himself to account as- if he were a god, instead of a.feeble,&#xD;
soft-hearted, muddle-headed mortal, and, in short, exalting himself under pre-'&#xD;
tence of a superhuman responsibility and contrition. It's as though a butterfly&#xD;
should claim that lie was the chief of sinners, because lie failed to fly as high&#xD;
as an eagle, or as though the automaton trumpet-player should put or dust and&#xD;
ashes because lie blew a poorer tune than the man who invented him, 'I do '&#xD;
believe that you two have done the best that God gave you the sense and heart&#xD;

THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
to do. Let us forget our little selves and our infinitesimal shortcomings, in&#xD;
sarveying the wisdom and power and goodness. of Deity. . It does seem to me&#xD;
that all has ended well enough to make all worthy souls turn their various&#xD;
murmurs into a song of content, Here is this poor murderer dead, a&amp;amp;Edward&#xD;
jlst now sends word to me; gone off after a short revival of consciousness, in&#xD;
which he talked about his.Origins of Speech, and wanted some charitable body&#xD;
to finish them for him; but not suffered to depart until he had confessed his&#xD;
crime in the hearing of the police, and so cleared the innocent. And here are&#xD;
all the rest of us spared to see the unravelling of this bloody web of mystery,&#xD;
and knowing each other to be guiltless. There is our crowning mercy. No&#xD;
more suspicions of ensanguined foot-tracks in our midst ! No Cain among us&#xD;
with a mark on his forehead! What an awful scene, by the way, that is in&#xD;
'Macbeth ' where Lady Macbeth washes and washes her hands in vain! Our&#xD;
hands are clean, and we know it. What we have done of evil is to suspect&#xD;
wrongfully. We must bow down to Edward and ask his pardon. I shall send&#xD;
a note to him at once."&#xD;
She paused in her torrent of speech, glanced anxiously and yet with a hu-&#xD;
morous expression at the girl beside her, and then asked, "Shall I say any-&#xD;
thing for you, Nestoria?"&#xD;
"I wrote to him last night," replied Nestoria, looking Mrs. Dinneford full&#xD;
in the face with that frankness and bravery which her eyes always had. " I&#xD;
told him how I had suspected him, and how I had come to believe him inno-&#xD;
cent. I asked his pardon. He will get the letter to-day."&#xD;
"And as soon as he gets it he will come here," said Mrs. Dinneford with&#xD;
smiling excitement, as of a woman who sees a bridal at hand.&#xD;
"rI should not think he would ever wish to see me gainn" murmured Nes-&#xD;
toria, shaking her golden head sorrowfully.&#xD;
Mrs. Dinneford merely patted the girl on the shoulder; she believed that&#xD;
an hour of purest happiness was-coming to her;. but sympathetic and garru-&#xD;
lous as she was, she would not forestall it by babbling. Lehmning, meanwhile,&#xD;
his pallid face propped up by a pillow, gazed at Nestoria with an indescribable&#xD;
tenderness, rejoicing in the joy which would soon be hers. He felt sure that&#xD;
she did not even guess of his love for her, and the fact that he had never re-&#xD;
vealed it gave him some small gladness. Had she known it, the knowledge&#xD;
might have troubled her now, when her other troubles were departing. Balm&#xD;
though her pity might have been to him, lie would not have purchased it at&#xD;
the cost of any diminution' of her happiness, so entirely had he given her his&#xD;
unselfish affection.&#xD;
Some hours later, while Mrs. Dinneford and Nestoria were together in the&#xD;
parlor, the door bell suddenly fell into a violent agitation, and the girl divined&#xD;
the arrival of Edward Wetherel. She turned pale at once, and caught her&#xD;
hostess by the skirt of the dress, whispering, "I cannot see him alone."&#xD;
The warm-hearted lady took her by the should rs, pushed her gently back&#xD;
upon a sofa, kissed her, and left the room. When Edward entered he saw his&#xD;
betrothed sitting moveless and seemingly unable to move, her childlike face as&#xD;
pale as it could be, and her blue eyes fixed on him in a kind of fascination of&#xD;
dreadful expectancy. He knew at once that the letter which she had Written&#xD;
him, imputing great wrong io herself, and humbly begging his forgiveness, had&#xD;
been. no mere verbal exaggeration, and no statement of monientary emotion,&#xD;
but an honest overflow of deep remorse and penitence. His very tiesh shook&#xD;
with pity for such trouble, and with longing to put an instant end to it. With-&#xD;

out a word he advanced softly to her, knelt on one knee at her feet, took both&#xD;
her hands in his and kissed them passionately.&#xD;
"Oh, no, no, no! I am not worthy," broke out Nestoria, the tears rolling&#xD;
down her cheeks. "You must not show me any kindness. You must not like&#xD;
me. I am unworthy of your trust. I have wronged you dreadfully and, un-&#xD;
pardonably."&#xD;
"But you have righted me," replied Edward, rising and taking a seat by&#xD;
her side, while still holding her hands. "You believe in me now?"&#xD;
"Yes, I know now that you are good," said the girl, sobbing so violently&#xD;
that her words were hardly distinguishable. "I kigow that you are far better&#xD;
than I am, very far better than I have been. I cannot talk about it. Did you&#xD;
get my letter? Did you read where I asked your pardon? "&#xD;
"I did, and I pardoned," he answered, comprehending her intense humil-&#xD;
iation and remorse, and believing that the blunt assurance of forgiveness would&#xD;
not pain but comfort her. " Do you still blame yourself? I do not.. Appear-&#xD;
ances were darkly against me. The life that I had 'led was my condemna-&#xD;
tion.. What a life it must have been, and was! I ought to ask your pardon&#xD;
for being such a man as that you could reasonably believe great ill of me. I&#xD;
ought to ask your pardon, and not you mine. Well, I trust that I have&#xD;
changed. I am at your feet once more. I ask you again to judge whether I&#xD;
am worthy to be your husband. Will you take me?"&#xD;
'"Oh, I must inot," groaned Nestoria. " It would be so wrong in me, after&#xD;
all I have done! Don't you think I need any punishment? " she burst out ve-&#xD;
hemently. 'Don't you see that you and everybody ought to punish me?  I&#xD;
have broken my word to you and my faith with society. I am a wicked,&#xD;
wicked woman."&#xD;
"No, no!" pleaded Edward. " Don't say that; at least not now. We will&#xD;
talk of your responsibility to society another time. What you did, you did&#xD;
for love of me, and I can only hold you the dearer for it. Do submit your&#xD;
mind and heart to mine. Do answer imy question."&#xD;
He put his arm around her, drew her gently close to him and forced her&#xD;
to lay her head upon his shoulder.&#xD;
"Oh, I am so weak against you!" whispered Nestoria, a calmer expres-&#xD;
sion stealing over her convulsed face. " I am so unable. to resist you!"&#xD;
"Then you will be engaged to me once more? " he begged. " Will you?"&#xD;
With a sigh which had the echo of sobs in it, Nestoria murmured brokenly,&#xD;
"If you wish it-if you will have it so-I must-yes."&#xD;
"But- I alone will be engaged," she continued, as he drew her closer and&#xD;
kissed away her tears.. "You shall be free., You shall turn me off whenever&#xD;
you wish. Promise it, Edward! Do you?"&#xD;
"No," he replied, holding her face between his hands and looking down&#xD;
into hei' eyes with a smile. "I bind myself to you forever."&#xD;
"Oh, how can you!" she exclaimed, giving up the contest and letting her&#xD;
head fall on his breast.&#xD;
After she had lain there a little while she suddenly caught up ogle of his&#xD;
hands in both hers, and before he could prevent her, pressed it to her lips. It&#xD;
was an instinctive, unpremeditated, passionate gesture of joyful humiliation,&#xD;
absolute confidence, and absorbing love. It apprised him, as perhaps nothing&#xD;
else could have done,-that he had given his heart to a heart which was alto-&#xD;
gether his, and which by its power of affection was worthy of all that he could&#xD;
give.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.                        219&#xD;
Herein, that is to say in her capacity'of living for others, lay the greatness&#xD;
of this simple girl, such greatness as she could claim. Amid all her ignorance&#xD;
of the world, amid her incompleteness of education and her youthful limita-&#xD;
tions of thought, amid her resultant errors of judgnient and of conduct, she&#xD;
was possessed by a heroic self-abnegation and an almost superhuman affection.&#xD;
Even when this man by her side had appeared to her quite dead in trespasses&#xD;
and sins, she had still so loved him that ghe could not denounce him to just&#xD;
punishment, and could not but continue to hope, against the evidence of her&#xD;
senses, in his innocence, and was willing to bear every extremity of 'suffering&#xD;
for his sake. Indeed, the central fact of her story is simply this, that in some'&#xD;
natures love is lord of all, ennobling them in spite of misdoing.&#xD;
It must be conceded that there has appeared in this stoi-y no grand triumph&#xD;
of conscience or of wisdom, i-ecommendable for wide imitation. Nestoria, a&#xD;
merely finite and fragile creature, has been guided by pungent emotion rather&#xD;
than by cool and large reflection. But at least her emotions have not con-&#xD;
cerned her alone; she has not lived, as a selfish woman in her place might&#xD;
have done, to "enjoy herself" and to "have a good time"; she has been lov-&#xD;
ing enough to bear through dolorous months the burden which' seemed to be-&#xD;
long to another. And with regard to her one evil deed, the persistent con-&#xD;
cealment of a supposed criminal, we may allege in her excuse that circum-&#xD;
stances had placed her in a position of singular difficulty, and that those cir-&#xD;
cumstances had been. prolonged by the immoral inefficiency of our judicial&#xD;
system, so that American society must shoulder a-part of her blameworthiness.&#xD;
Well, she had fought out her wretched battle, and now she was receiving&#xD;
her reward.' She was lying on the heart of a man intelligent enough to divine&#xD;
what stings of terror and of conscience she had borne for his sake, and grate-&#xD;
fully loving enough to cover both her bygone sorrows and her clinging re-&#xD;
morse with a flood of consolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER LVI.&#xD;
WHAT BECAME OF THEM ALL.&#xD;
"AH! this cannot last-this ought not to last," Nestoria exclaimed of a sud&#xD;
den, drawing herself back from Edward and looking him in the face with a&#xD;
strange mixture of fear and joy.&#xD;
"I am too happy," she went on. "I do not deserve any such happiness.&#xD;
It will be surely taken away from me, unless I become' more worthy of it., I&#xD;
must strive\ in some way to be more fit for it than I have been and am. Do&#xD;
you know what I have long thought ;that I must do as soon as this mystery&#xD;
should clear away and I could see to stir? I have felt that I must pass the&#xD;
rest of my life in suffering to do good, instead of suffering, as I have done, to&#xD;
do evil. I have wanted to- go as a-missionary," she faltered out, with a&#xD;
piteous, pleading gaze into his eyes,.as if doubting whether he would let her&#xD;
go.&#xD;
We know already that Wetherel was of the firm and even masterful caste&#xD;
of souls, such as his ancestors had mostly been before him, in spite of&#xD;
their prevailing devoutness; but the .look of 'tenderness which he now bent&#xD;
upon Nestoria showed that over her he intended to hold no sceptre of unper-&#xD;
suasive rule. This one being was to be on equal terns with him, the asso-&#xD;
ciated monarch of their united life, at least so far as she should desire.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE WETHEREL AFFAIR.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My dear child, our existence is to be one," he said gently, at the same&#xD;
time kissing her hands. "I do not wish to dissuade you from obeying your&#xD;
conscience, nor from going where you can do the most good to others. But&#xD;
must we not consider also where I cah be useful? You are already possessed&#xD;
of a foreign language which will enable you to be at once of worth on a nis-&#xD;
sion. I should have to study years to acquire that language. Moreover, I&#xD;
have not even a profession; there are more years of.waiting and preparation;&#xD;
and meanwhile life is hurrying by. Then, on the other hand, among my own&#xD;
countrymen there is work all ready for' me, and more than I can do. If 1&#xD;
am forced to retain a portion of my uncle's estate, I shall have means to enter&#xD;
upon large philanthropies, such as I can myself oversee. I have thought this all&#xD;
over many times already, and decided that I can be usefullest in America. Oh,&#xD;
there are huge plans for doing good in my poor head," he added, with an apol-&#xD;
ogetical smile. "But, grandiose as they are, they may come to something.&#xD;
Will you not let your decision wait until you can hear about them ? "&#xD;
"Ah, yes," sighed Nestoria, conscious, and joyfully conscious, too, despite&#xD;
her scruples, of that weakness of love which trusts all to the love of a stronger&#xD;
soul. " You must be considered. You ,can do far more in the vorld than I.&#xD;
You must not be planted in poor earth because I might grow there to-my own&#xD;
satisfaction. I leave everything to you."&#xD;
It was not'a painful act of submission, although she did for an instant have&#xD;
a vague fear lest she were doing wrong, and lest her fretful consciencemight&#xD;
some day assault her because of it.&#xD;
And now footsteps were heard, and Nestoria ran away to hide her happi-&#xD;
ness, rustling out of one door as Mrs.'Dinneford, Alice, and Lehming entered&#xD;
by another. The elder lady's eye sought Wetherel's face with a cordial yet'&#xD;
humorous glance of inquiry.&#xD;
" It is all as it should be," said .the young man; whereupon Mrs. Dinne-&#xD;
ford smiled with pleasure, while Lehming, too shrewd at guessing, turned&#xD;
pale.&#xD;
Then there was much talk about the adventure of the past night, the won-&#xD;
derful discovery and punishment of the murderer, and, in short, about the&#xD;
whole Wetherel Affair.&#xD;
"Only one thing-remains to be settled," said Edward. " That is the own-&#xD;
ersnip of this estate. I have pieced the will together as far as may be, and&#xD;
shown it to a lawyer. He says that it is worthless. The signature of the tes-&#xD;
tator is torn off and partly destroyed. The signatures of the witnesses have&#xD;
entirely vanished. The provisions are more or less incomplete. ,In short, it&#xD;
is worthless. I am the heir."&#xD;
"It is well," assented Lehming, in a firm voice, while Mrs. Dinneford and&#xD;
Alice uttered some murmur of assent, which was naturally less clear and&#xD;
emphatic.&#xD;
"I will tell you what I propose," continued 'Edward. "I propose to pay&#xD;
in full the legacies to p ilanthropic and religious objects, so far as they can&#xD;
be made out or inferred . So much must be done out of respect to the- life-&#xD;
long character of the dead as a lover of his fellow men and of his Maker.&#xD;
You agree to that, I see. But after that, what? You must admit that it is a&#xD;
weighty, and at the same time a delicate question. I have tried to decide upon&#xD;
some plan of division, without being able to satisfy myself. I llave offered&#xD;
you the whole, and you have refused. Nor will I take the whole. There we&#xD;
are at a deadlock. You three must help me out." .&#xD;

THE WETIIEREL AFFAIR,.&#xD;
&#xD;
221&#xD;
&#xD;
"It reminds me," put in Mrs. Dinneford, " of the favorite exhortation of a&#xD;
pious, speechless deacon whom I used to know. ' Brethren,' he used to say,&#xD;
prayer-meeting after prayer-meeting, ' brethren, we mustn't have too much&#xD;
delicacy.' What the  good old slow creature meant by it I never could im-&#xD;
agine, nor, I dare say, he either. But it applies to our situation-surely. 'We&#xD;
are bothered by too much delicacy. Somebody ought to speak plainly and in&#xD;
business-like fashion; and when it comes to business, I say let the men&#xD;
begin.&#xD;
" Certainly," nod1ed Wetherel. "Come, Walter, you are a just man; tell&#xD;
us what shall be done."&#xD;
"I have a whim," replied Lehming with a smile-" I have a whim which&#xD;
settles my portion. It seems to me that I may fairly claim the rewards, all&#xD;
of them; those offered by the authorities and by the estate, those offered for&#xD;
the discovery of Miss Bernard and of the criminal. They come to twenty&#xD;
thousand dollars. That sum will just serve me. I claim it, aidt no more.&#xD;
Don't interrupt me, Edward. You called on me to judge this case.' Well, as&#xD;
for these excellent Dinneford ladies," he continued, smiling from one to an-&#xD;
other, "they ought surely to "be as liberal, or magnanimous, or just, or vhat-&#xD;
ever it may be, between them, as I am alone. I give up a quarter of a mil-&#xD;
lion which doesn't belong to me. Let them club together and do the same.&#xD;
That leaves them a quarter of a million, which is not pinching poverty, even&#xD;
in these times. As for the heir at law," turning to Wetherel, "let him take&#xD;
his half million and hold his peace. There, you have my arbitration, and I&#xD;
sincerely hope that no one will oppose it.&#xD;
There was a general smile, which was clearly one of satisfaction, and&#xD;
which ended the discussion. In short, such were the terms according to which&#xD;
this fastidiously delicate matter of settling the' Wetherel estate was finally de-&#xD;
cided. The Dinnefords were more than content' vith their allotment, and&#xD;
Lehming positively refused to accept aught but what he had 'assigned&#xD;
nimself.&#xD;
And now John Bowlder rumbled into the house, as big and noisy and&#xD;
cheerful and unpracti al as ever.&#xD;
"There is your do ar, Walter," were his first words, meanwhile thrusting&#xD;
a bill into Lehming's  east pocket. " Take it before I become vainglorious&#xD;
over it and assume it a  blaz  or turn greedy and put it at interest. Take&#xD;
it as a present, if not o ier) 'se.  t is a curiosity. It is Bowlder's only dollar,&#xD;
the only one that ever re,  be onged to him, because the only one that he&#xD;
ever earned. He wants never to see it again. He desires no more dollars&#xD;
from that source. Ife prefers money that has been left him. Toil is all very&#xD;
well for the predestined and habituated sons of toil; but the soul which basks&#xD;
in its own, sunshine can be happiest without it. By the way, I hear that the&#xD;
Wetherel, myster' has exploded, and that Nettie Fulton has reappeared out&#xD;
of- it as Nestoria Bernard. Life is protean. It is also a Nemesis. Nemesis&#xD;
at times interfer ,s with Proteus, and tears off his disguises. Meanwhile the&#xD;
tranquil soul looks on, and thinks it as good as a play, taking that much inter&#xD;
,est 'in it, and no more. The girl Nestoria,' however, I should like' to see&#xD;
Thera-is somewhat about her which is good for the spectator, making him&#xD;
both happy and benign.'&#xD;
So Nestoria was sent for, and Bowlder greeted her with affectionate uproar,&#xD;
'very absurd in a philosopher.&#xD;
"I1 rejoice heartily," he admitted, " that your worries are over. I am&#xD;

&#xD;
driven to profess at least as much common humanity as that. You are one&#xD;
of the magicians, and bring me down to earth."&#xD;
"How does poor Imogen Eleonore get on?" asked Nestoria. "Is she&#xD;
lonely? Tell her I shall soon come to see her."&#xD;
" Poor Imogen has taken to herself another likewise poor creature, and&#xD;
gone into the moonshine of betrothed bliss," returned Bowlder. " A lover of&#xD;
ancient days came down from Vermont yesterday, and carried her off this&#xD;
morning with such ease that it seemed as if she were carrying him off. It is&#xD;
not often that two souls take on a duality more promptly. She promised wed-&#xD;
ding cake in time. Her last words to me were, Farewell, a long farewell!&#xD;
Let us hope that she spoke prophetically," solemnly added Bowlder, who had&#xD;
at last discovered that Miss Jones's grandiose conversation had the emptiness&#xD;
as well as the gaudiness of a soap bubble. "The Turks believe that idiots&#xD;
are inspired. But that credence is not a part of 'my religion. At all events,&#xD;
I desire to hear no more of Imogen Eleonore's inspirations, and warn you&#xD;
against her as being not heavenly but mundane, and poor at that."&#xD;
" Ah! she had( not helped you," said Nestoria thoughtfully. " I owesher&#xD;
much kindness.   must think how I can repay her."&#xD;
We need add no more, unless the reader would like to know that Alice&#xD;
Dinneford, blessed with a sufficient fortune and some experimental wisdom,&#xD;
means to have an American husband of the usual sort, and will probably&#xD;
not find it hard to get one.&#xD;
