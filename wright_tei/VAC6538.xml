UNIVERSITY PRESS: WELCH, BIGELOW, &amp; CO., CAMBRIDGE.   GOOD STORIES.  FROM HAND TO MOUTH'  I. -HOW I FELL IN WITH COUNT GOLOPTIOUS. THE evening of the 8th of November, in the present year, was distinguished by the occurrence of two sufficiently remarkable events. On that evening Mr. Ullman produced Meyerbeer's opera of "The Huguenots," for the first time in this country, and we were unexpectedly visited by a snow-storm. Winter and the great lyri- cal dramatist made their debut together. Winter opened with a slow movement of heavy snow-flakes, -.an andante, soft and melan" choly, and breathing of polar drowsiness. The echoing streets were muffled, and the racket and din of the thoroughfares sounded like the roar of a far-off ocean. The large flakes fell sleepily through the dim blue air, like soft white birds that had been strick- en with cold in the upper skies, and were sinking benumbed to earth. The trees and lamp-posts, decorated with snowy powder, gave the city the air of being laid out for a grand supper-party, with ornamental confectionery embellishing the long white table. Through the hoar drifts that lay along the streets peeped the black tips of building-stones and mud-piles in front of half-finished houses, until Broadway looked as if it was enveloped in an ermine robe, dotted with the black tails with which cunning furriers ornament that skin, Despite the snow, I sallied forth with my friend Cobra, the musi- cal critic of the New York Daily Cockchafer, to hear Meyerbeer's masterpiece.  We entered a mute omnibus with a frozen driver,  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6538-00000003"/> whose congealed hands could scarcely close upon our fares,- which accounted perhaps for a slight error in the change he gave us,- and so rolled up silently to Union Square, whence we, floundered into the Academy. I listened to that wonderful picture of one of France's anniversaries of massacre, with bloody copies of which that "God-protected country" (vide speech from the throne on any public occasion) is continually furnishing the civilized world. The roar of Catholic cannon, -the whistle of Huguenot bullets, - the stealthy tread of conspiring priests,- the mournful wailing of wo- men whose hearts foretell evil before it comes,--the sudden out- burst of the treacherous, bloodthirsty Romish tiger, -the flight and shrieks of men and women about to die, -the valiant, despair- ing fighting of the stern Protestants,--the voice of the devilish French king, shouting from his balcony to his assassins the re- morseless command, "Tuez! tuez!"-the ominous trickling of the red streams that sprung fromn cloven Lutheran hearts, and rolled slowly through the kennels; all this arose before me vital and real, as the music of that sombre opera smote the air. Cobra, whose business it was - being a critic - not to attend to the performance, languidly surveyed the house, or availed himself of the intermission' between the acts to fortify himself with certain refreshing but stim- ulating beverages. The opera being concluded, we proceeded to Pilgarlik's, - Pil- garlik keeps a charming private restaurant at the upper end of Broadway,  and there, over a few reed-birds and a bottle of Bur-. gundy, Cobra concocted his criticism on "The Huguenots," -in which he talked learnedly of dominants, sub-dominants, ascending by thirds, and descending by twenty-thirds, and such like, while I, with nothing more weighty on my mind than paying for the supper, smoked my cigar and sipped my concluding cup of black coffee in a state of divine repose. The snow was deep, when, at about one o'clock, A. M., Cobra and myself parted at the corner of Eighth Street and Broadway, each bound for his respective home. Cobra lived in Fourth Avenue, - I live, or lived, in Bleecker Street. The snow was deep, and the   city quite still, as I half ran, half floundered down the sidewalk thinking what a nice hot brandy-toddy I would make myself when I got home, and the pleasure I would have in boiling the water over my gas-light on a lately invented apparatus which I had ac-, quired, and in which I took much pride; I also recollected with a thrill of pleasure that I had purchased a fresh supply of lemons that morning, so that nothing was needed for the scientific concoction of a nightcap. I turned down Bleecker Street and reached my door. I was singing a snatch of Pierre Dupont's song of La Vigne as I pulled out my night-key and inserted it in that orifice so perplex- ing to young men who have been to a late supper. One vigorous twist, and I was at home. The half-uttered triumphal chant of the Frenchman, who dilates with metrical malice on the fact that the vine does not flourish in England, died on my lips. The key turned, but the door, usually so yielding to the members of our fam- ily, obstinately refused to open. A horrible thought flashed across my mind. They had locked me out! A new servant had perhaps arrived, and cautiously barricaded the entrance; or the landlady - to whom, at the moment, I was under some slight pecuniary re- sponsibility--had taken this cruel means of recalling me to a sense of my position. But it could not be. There was some mistake. There was fluff in my key, --yes, that was it,-- there was fluf in the barrel of my night-key. I instantly proceeded to make a Pan. dean pipe of that instrument, and blew into the tube until my face resembled that queer picture of the wind in Zsop's fables, as it is represented in the act of endeavoring to make the traveller take of his cloak. A hopelessly shrill sound responded to my efflorts. The key was clear as a flute. Was it the wrong key? I felt in every pocket, vaguely expecting a supernumerary one to turn up, but in vain. While thus occupied, the conviction forced itself on my mind that I had no money. Locked out, with a foot of snow on the ground, and nothing but a three-cent piece and two new cents-so painfully bright that they presented illusory resemblances to half-eagles -in my pocket!  I knew well that an appeal to the bell was hopeless. I had  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6538-00000004"/> 6 CGOOD STORIES. tried it once before for three hours at a stretch, without the slight- est avail. It is my private conviction that every member of that household, who slept at all within hearing of the bell, carefully stuffed his or her ears with cotton before retiring for the night, so as to be out of the reach of temptation to answer it. Every inmate of that establishment, after a certain hour, determinedly rehearsed  the part of Ulysses when he was passing the Sirens. They were deaf to the melody of the bell. I once knew a physician who, to keep up appearances, had a night-bell affixed to his door. The initiated alone knew that he regularly took the tongue out before he went to bed. His conscience was satisfied, and he slept calmly. I might just as well have been pulling his bell. Break the windows! Why not? Excellent idea; but, as I be- fore stated, my pecuniary position scarcely allowed of such liberties. What was I to do? I could not walk up and down the city all niglt. I would freeze to death, and there would be a horrible paragraph in the morning papers about the sad death of a destitute author. I ran over rapidly in my mind every hotel in the city with which I was at all acquainted, in order to see if there was in any one of them a night-porter who knew me. Alas! Night-porters knew me not. Why had I not a watch or a diamond ring? I re- solved on the instant to purchase both as soon as I got ten or twelve hundred dollars. I began to wonder where the news-boys' depot was, and recollected there was a warm spot somewhere over the Herald press-room, on which I had seen ragged urchins hud- dling as I passed by late of night. I was ruminating gravely over the awful position in which I was placed, when a loud but somewhat buttery voice disturbed me by shouting from the sidewalk: c; Ha, ha! Capitaljoke! Locked out, eh? You 'll never get in." A stranger! perhaps benevolent, thought I. If so, I am .indeed saved. To rush down the steps, place my hand upon his shoulder, and gaze into his face with the most winning expression I was capa ble of assuming, was but the work of several minutes, - which, however, included two tumbles on the stoop. "Can it -can it be,' I said, a that you have a night-key?"   J(- AFROM        HAND  TO MOUT.- "Anight-key!" e answered with ajollylaugh, and speakiog a if his mouth was full of turtle,-' a night-key!g at the deuca should I do with a night-key? I never go home until morn ing. X -t Sir," said I' sadly, "do not jest with the misery of a fellow-crea- ture I conjure you by the sanctity of your fireside to lend m your night-key." "You 've got one in your hand; why don't you -use that?" I had. In the excitement of the moment I had quite overlooked the fact that, if I had fifty night-keys, I would still have found my- self on the wrong side of the door. '"The fact is-pardon me-but I forgot that the door was locked on the inside."a "Well, you can't get in, and you can't stay out," said the stran- ger, chuckling over a large mouthful of turtle. "What are you going to do?" "Heaven only knows, unless you are in a position to lend me a dollar, which, sil; I assure yoq, shall be returned in the morning." "Nonsense.  I never lend money. But if you like, you shall come to my hotel and spend the night there, free of charge." "The Hotel de Coup d'CEil, in Broadway." "I never heard of such an establishment." "Perhaps. Nevertheless, it is what is called a first-class hotel." "Well, but who are you, sir?"I inquired; for, in truth, my ss- picions began to be slightly excited bry this time. My interlocutor was rather a singular-looking person, as well as I could make out his features in the dusk. Middle height, broad shoulders, and a square, pale face, the upper part of which seemed literally covered with a pair of huge blue spectacles, while the lower portion was hidden in a frizzly beard. : A small space on either cheek was all that was uncovered, and that shone white and cold as the snow that lay on the streets. "Who are you, sir " "I am Count Goloptious, Literary Man, Bon vivant, Foreiah Nobleman, Linguist, Duellist, Dramatist, and Philanthropist."  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6538-00000005"/> tX .      $-OOD STORIES. "IBather contradictory pursuits, sir," I said, rather puzzled by the man's manner, and wishing to say something.  Of course. Every man is a mass of contradictions in his pres- ent social state." "But I never heard your name mentioned in the literary world, I remarked. "What have you written?" "What have I not written? Gory essays upon Kansas for the New York Tribune. Smashing personal articles for the Herald. Carefully constructed non-committal double-reflex-action with es- cape-movement leaders for the Daily Times; sensation dramas for -the Phantom Theatre. Boisterous practical joke comedies for Mr. Behemoth the low comedian; and so on ad infinitum." "Then as a bon vivant -?" "I have been immensely distinguished. When Brillat Savarin was in this country, I invented a dish which nearly killed him. I called it Surprise des Singes avec petite verole."  'Linguist?" "I speak seventeen languages, sir." "Duellist?" "I was elected a Member of Congress for South Carolina." "Philanthropist?" "Am I not offering to you, a stranger, the hospitality of the Hotel de Coup d'aEil?" "Enough, sir," I cried; '- I accept your offer. I thank you for your timely assistance." "Then let us go," answered the Count Goloptious, offering me his arm. II. - THE HOTEL DE COUP D'EIL. THE Count led me out of Bleecker Street into Broadway. We trudged a few blocks in silence, but whether towards Union Square or the Battery I could not for the life of me tell. It seemed as if I had lost all my old landmarks. The remarkable corners and sign- posts of the great thoroughfare seemed to have vanished. r   FRAOM       HAN-D TO; -MO UTH. .4 ZOZ Mfir  edif i2iceTT, - uit - f We stopped at length befoie a large edifice, built of w ht seemed at first glance to be a species of variegated marble on examin- ing more closely, I perceived that every stone in e front of the building was a mosaic, in which was represente one of the four chief organs of the body.  The stones were arraged in the form of a cross, with these designs depicted on them.  The effect of the entire front of this huge building, staring at you with a myriad painted eyes, listening to you with a myriad painted ears, beckoning to you with a myriad painted hands, and grinning at you with a myriad painted mouths, was inconceivably strange and bewildering. "This is the Hotelj" said Count Goloptious. S Let us enter." We passed under a gigantic portal towards- two gleaming doors of plate-glass, which voluntarily unclosed as we approached. A mag- nificent hall lay before us. The pavement was of tessellated marble, on every square of which the strange emblems which decorated the front of the establishment were repeated. From the centre of this vast chamber a spiral staircase arose, from each coil of which small bridges of delicate gilt iron work branched off, and led into what seemed to be the corridors of the building. At one end of the hall stood a curious Oriental-looking structure, within which, seat- ed upon a sort of throne, I beheld a portly bearded personage \                            Pe  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6538-00000006"/> 10     . -   G- -GOOD STORIES. whose breast was festooned with gold chains, and whose fingers were covered with rings. "That is the night clerk," whispered the Count to me, pointing to this person. "Go and enter your name on the book." I approached the Oriental temple, and, finding a hotel register with leaves of vellum and bound in silver and mother-of-pearl, open on a shelf close by, took up a pen and wrote down my name. The clerk did not even condescend to glance at me, while doing this. "Would you like some supper?" asked the Count. "4 No, no," I answered; s I want only to go to bed." The truth is, the whole scene so bewildered me, that I began to fear that I had gone mad. - Very well. I will call for your candle." So saying the Count approached a large model of a human ear, which was fixed in the wall of the Oriental temple, and putting his lips to it called out, "A bedroom light for 746." In an instant a continuous murmur seemed to fill the hall and ascend towards the roof of the building. It appeared to me that ten thousand voices took up the words," A bedroom light for 746," one after the other, until the sentence rolled along like the fire of a line of infantry. I turned, startled, towards the direction from which those echoes proceeded, and on casting my eyes upon the great spiral staircase beheld the cause. "I. -EYE, EAR, HAND, AND MOUTH. THE balustrades of the staircase on either side, and the sides of the different galleries branching off, were all decorated with two of the mystical emblems I had before seen so often repeated in this strange hotel. On the one side a line of human mouths ran up the edges of the staircase, while on the other a line of human hands occupied a corresponding position. There was, however, this differ- ence between them and the symbols occupying the front of the ,establishment. They were all modelled in high relief The balus-   s FROM IIAND TO MOUTI. trades seemed as if they had been decorated with the pillage of numberless anatomical museums. As I turned suddenly and glanced towards the staircase, I saw the lips of those ten thousand mouths moving, and whispering softly but distinctly the words, "A bed- room light for 746." I had scarcely recovered from the astonishment with which this sight overwhelmed me, and the rolling whisper had hardly died away in the domed roof of the hall, when my attention was attracted by a speck of light whiclh appeared far away up on the staircase, and seemed to-be travelling slowly down the huge spiral. I watched it with a sort of stupid interest, and when it came nearer discovered that it was nothing less than a chamber was-light in a silver can- dlestick, which the tell thousand hands that lined the edge of the balustrade opposite to the balustrade of the mouths were carefully passing from one to the other. In a few moments it reached the bottom, where the last hand, a huge muscular-looking fist, held it. There is your light," said the Count; " follow it up stairs, and it will lead you to your room. I will, for the present, wish you a good-night, as I have to go and take my before morning walks."  I confusedly wished my strangeP friend good night, and walked towards the hand that held my candl-e. As I approached. the hand passed it to the hand next above, and the candle so began to ascend the stairs. I followed. After toiling up an interminable number of steps, the hands suddenly took the candle off into one of the side galleries, in-which at last it stopped before a huge polished doors on the upper panels of which were painted again a huge eye and an equally gigntic ear. I could not help noticingthat the eye had a demoniac expression. I pushed the door open, and, taking the candle from the attendant hand, was about to enter the room, when my attention was attracted by that member giving my coat a gentle twitch. I turned, and there beheld the hand stretched out with an expression -if ever hand had an expression which was inexpressibly pleading..-.I  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6538-00000007"/> I12    -   GOOD STORIES. was puzzled. -What could it want? I would follow the example of my friend Count Goloptious, and speak to the ealr. Approach- ing my lips to the ear painted over my door, I put the question, "What does this amiable hand want?' In an instant a fusillade of whispers came rolling up the line of mouths, answering, "He wants a quarter for his trouble." My heart sank, - I had only five cents. "Pshaw!" said I, trying to bluff the thing off, i' I can't attend to it now"; and so saying, stepped towards my room. As I entered and hurriedly closed the door, I beheld every hand down the long coil of stairs simultaneously double up and shake at me in menace, while a horrid sardonic laugh ran down the line of mlouths. I never beheld anything more devilish than that spiral smile of scorn. On closing the door of my room, I was not a little annoyed to find that the eye and the ear, which were on the outside, were on the inside also, so exactly alike that they seemed to have come through for the purpose of watching me, and listening to my sleep- talk. I felt wretchedly uncomfortable at the idea of undressing before that eye. It was fixed on me wherever I nloved in the room. I tlried to pin a handkerchief over it, but the wood of the door was too hard and the pins would not stick. As the lhandker- chief fell to the ground, I beheld the horrid eye wink at me withe a devilish expression of derision. Determined not to be overlooked, I put out the light and undressed in the dark, when I tumbled into bed in a state of confusion of mind not easily described. I had scarcely laid my head on the pillow, when I heard a distinct knock at my door. Cursing the intrusion, and not withlout some tremor, being uncertain what new enchantment might be brewing, I opened it. There was the hand outstretched, and pleading for its infer- nal quarter. - The abominable member was evidently determined to keep me awake all night. There was but one thing to be done,-to bribe him with a promise. H put my lips to the ear and- -said: If the hand does not disturb me, I will put a gold ring on his finger to-morrow."   *FROMn HAND TO - OUTHV         1 S JThe ten thousand mouths repeated-with tones of approvalj;' Heo will put a gold ring on his finger fo-morrow," and the ten thousand- 3 hands waved their thanks. I shut my door, congratulatinga my- self on my escape, and, flinging myself on the bed, soon fell fast- asleep. II JIV. - DR. KITCHENER IN A DREAM. A HORRIBLE heat seemed to surround my head. I suffered in- Jj tolerable agony. Count Goloptious had unscrewed my caput just at the point known to anatomists as the condyles, and deliberately placed it in the centre of a ring of burning brands which he had laid on the floor. The Philanthropic Duellist then drew a volume from his pocket, which, even in my excited condition, I could not" help recognizing as Doctor IKitchener's cookery-book, and com- menced deliberately to read aloud the recipe for roasting a goose alive, which is contained in that immortal SWork. I now perceived with unutterable indignation that he , intended to cook my head after Kitchener's inhuman instructions. The flames leaped higher and hithller around my blistering cheeks. My whiskers - whiskers on which countless barbers had exhausted the resources of their art-shrivelled into ashy nothings. My eyeballs protruded, my lips cracked; my tongue, hard and wooden, beat against the roof of my mouth. I uttered a half-inarticulate cry for water. The Count laughed a devilish laugh, and consulted his book. "True," he said, "the wolrthy doctor says, that when the goose thirsteth let her be fed with water, so that the flesh shall be tender. when cooked. Let us give the poor head a drink." So saying, he reached towards my parched lips a pannilkin fixed on the end of a long handle. I quaffed eagerly the liquor which it. contained. Ah! how grateful was that draught of brandy-and- water! I drained the cup to the bottom. But the bliss was shorts lived. The flames hissed and crackled. M y hair caught fire, and my poor head blazed like a Frenchman's " ponch-bol." The spalr-  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6538-00000008"/> "         GOOD STORIES. kles from the burning brands flew against my forehead and into my eyes, scorching and blinding me. My brain simmered in the arched cells of my skull. My anguish was insufferable, and as a last desperate resource I cried out to the Count: "Take me from the fire, - take me from the fire, - I amn overdone!" The Count answered to this: "Patience, patience, head of a heathen! You are roasting beautifully. A few minutes more, and I will pour some Worcestershire sauce over you." Worcestershire sauce! That essence of every peppery condi- ment known to civilized man! Worcestershire sauce, the delight of East Indian officers on half-pay, and the horror of Frenclh- men who encounter it in London restaurants, and return to a( La Belle" with excoriated palates ; this biting, inflammatory stuff to be poured over a wretched head, whose scalp was cracking like the skin of a roasted apple, -it was too much to endure, so I gave vent to my feelings in one unearthly shriek of agony and - awoke. My head was hot, but, thank Heaven, it was not roasting. It was lying on a tumbled pillow across which a stream of the morning sunlight was pouring in a golden tide. There was no Count Golop- tious, - no circle of firebrands,-no Worcestershire sauce, --I was in bed, and alone in the Hotel de Coup d'CEil. So soon as I had sufficiently recovered from the effects of my horrible dream, I sat up in bed, and inspected my apartment. It was large and lofty and sumptuously furnished. A touching atten- tion to my necessities was visible as I glanced round the room. By my bedside, on a small buhl table, stood a large tumbler contain- ing a creaming champagne cocktail. I drained it as a libation to the God of Morning. It was an appropriate sacrifice. The early sunlight itself seemed to flash through its amber globules. The white foam of dawn creamed in its effervescence. The tonic flavor of the fresh air that blows over the awaking earth was represented by the few drops of Boker's bitters with which it was tinctulred. The immediate glow which it sent through every limb typified the healthy circulation produced by morning exercise.   FROM HAND TO MOUTH.           15 I lay back on my pillow and began to speculate on the strange series of incidents which had-befallen me. Who was Count Golop- tious? What weird hotel was this, of which I had become an inmate? Were the days of enchantment indeed revived? or did I merely dream of those myriads of beseeching hands and whisper- ing mouths and ever-wakeful eyes-? I glanced involuntarily to the door at this juncture, and lo,' there I beheld the eye which seemed set in the panel of my door. A full flood of the sunlight that poured across my bed struck across that side of my room, and I saw the eye winking drowsily in the blaze,-drowsily, but yet wakefully, like one who is accus- tomed to watch between sleeping and waking; a sentinel which was never entirely somnolent. The eye was watching me, despite the sleepy film with which it was overspread. Did I make any abrupt movement in the bed, its half-closed lid suddenly opened, and stared at me with. appalling vigilance. There was no avoiding it. It commanded every corner of the room. How was I to rise and attire myself, with so unpleasant a super- vision? I had no longer the resource of extinguishing the lights The sun was beyond the reach of such a process. I meditated for a while, and at length hit upon the idea of constructing a species of wigwam out of the bedclothes, and dressing myself under its shel- ter. This I accomplished all the more easily, as I had laid my clothes, on retiring to-rest, within easy reach of the bed; and as H constructed my impromptu tent, I thought I could discern an expres- sion of drowsy disappointment shooting from underneath the half- closed lid of the Sentinel Eye. V.- HOW I MAGNETIZED MY EYE. HAVING finished my toilet sufficiently to justify my stepping from my bed, I was proceeding with my ablutions, when I heard a few chords struck upon a piano, in what seemed to be the next Q,  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6538-00000009"/> 161-         1GOOD STOBRIES apartment. The moment after, a rich, luxurious contralto voice commenced to sing Schubert's beautiful serenade. I listened en- tranced. It seemed as if Alboni herself were singing. Those show- ers of rich, round notes falling in rhythmical sequence; that sostenuto, that, when first uttered, seemed a sound too weak to live, but grow- ingo and swelling every moment until it filled all the air with delicious sound, and then lessening and lessening till it almost died away, like distant music heard across the sea at night; those firm ac centuations; the precision of those vocal descents, when the voice seemed to leap from the pinnacles of the gamut with the surety and fearlessness of a chamois-hunter leaping from Alpine peaks; - all told me that I was listening to a queen of song. I ran to the window of my room, and, opening it, thrust my head forth. There was a window next to mine, but I could see nothing The blinds were down, but I could feel the glass panes vibrating with that wondrous tide of song. A woman, - a great singer, - the greatest I had ever heard, lived next to me. What was she like? That heavenly voice could never come from a lean and withered chest, from a skeleton throat. She must be young, must be lovely. I determined on the instant to form her acquaintance. But there was the Sentinel Eye! How to evade the vigilance of that abominable optic? Its horrible magnetic gaze followed me in every motion that I made. Magnetic gaze! There was an idea. It wasdoubtless an enchanted eye; but was there any en- chantment that could stand against the human will? I was strong, body and soul. My magnetic power I had frequently proved to be of the highest force; why not exerci;.e it on my sentinel? I re- solved to attempt to magnetize The Eye! I shut the window, and, taking a chair, seated myself opposite the demoniac optic. - I fixed my eyes upon it, and, concentrating all the will of which I was master, sent a powerful magnetic current straight to the centre of the glaring pupil. It would be a desperate struggle, I knew, but I wras determined not to succumb. The Eye became uneasy. It glanced hither and thither, and seemed to wish    FROM HAND   TO MOUTH.         17 to avoid my gaze.  The painted eyelids drooped; the devilish pupil contracted and dilated, but still the orb always had to return and meet mine, Presently the glaze of a magnetic sleep began to overspread it. The scintillating lights that played within grew dim. The lid drooped, and, after lifting once or twice, I beheld the long, dark lashes fall, and slumber veiled my sentinel. VI. - FAIR ROSAMOND- No sooner was the Sentinel -Eye fairly magnetized than I has- tened to the window and flung it open. I possess a tolerable tenor voice, and as I thought vocalism was the simplest way of attracting the attention of the fair unknown, I sang the first verse of the charming serenade in the Knight of Arva; a melody full of grace and passion, for which Mr. Glover never obtained sufficient com- mendation. I had hardly concluded the first verse when I heard the neighboring window unclose. Unable to restrain my curiosity, I thrust my head out of my casement. Almost at the same instant a lovely face emerged firom the window on the right. I had just time to get a flash of a glorious blond head, when the apparition disappeared. My head went in also; I waited a few moments, then cautiously, and after the manner of a turtle, protruded my caput once more. The Blond Head was out, but went in again like a flash. I remained with outstretched neck. After- a brief pause I saw a gleam of fair curls. Then a white forehead, then a nose retrousse, then an entire face. I instantly withdrew into my shell. The Blond Head was** timid, and I wished to encourage it. Have you ever seen those philosophical toys which are construct- ed for the purpose of telling whether the day will be rainy or shiny? No. Then I will describe one to you. There is a rustic house with two portals, one on either side. In the portal on the right a little man is concealed; in the portal on No. 4,     2  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6538-00000010"/> 18          GOOD- STORIES. the left, a woman. They are both connected with a vertical coil of catgut, which runs from the base to the roof of the house, betweer the two. In dry weather Me catgut relaxes, and the little man, by the action of such relaxation, is swung out of his portal into the open air. In wet weather the catgut contracts, and the woman en joys the atmosphere. This toy has two advantages. One is, tha it is infallible in its predictions, as it never announces fine weathei until the weather is already fine; the other, that it affords an admi rable illustration of the present social state of woman. When the day of storm arrives, in goes the man to his comfortable shelter and out comes the woman to brave the elements. How many house holds does this typify! In sunshine and summer weather the hus band is a charming fellow, and flaunts abroad in all his splendor but when the clouds gather, when the fire goes out on the heart} for want of fuel, and duns are at the door, then poor woman is sen out to meet them, while the lord of creation hides in the cellar I commend the toy to the consideration of Miiss Lucy Stone. Well, the Blond Head and myself played at weather-telling foi five minutes. No sooner was one in than the other was out. I was a game of " tee to-tottering " performed after a new fashion I resolved to put an end to it. I gave three distinct hems. There is a good deal of expression in a "hem." There is the hem of alarm, such as Alexis gives to Corydon, who is flirting ii the garden with Phillis, when that young lady's mother is approach ing. There is the hem of importance, such as that with which ol Beeswax, the merchant, who is " worth his million, sir," preface a remark: the hem of confusion, - the hem of derision or unbelief -the hem of satisfaction, - the hem of disappointment, - in short a whole circle or hemmysphere of hems, each expressive in its wa) of a peculiar emotion. My hem was the hem of interrogation. It was answered, and the next moment the Blond Head hov ered, as- it were, on the window-sill. It looked like a bird whos cage door has been opened after years of captivity, and who flutter on the threshold, not daring to advance into the free air.   FROM  HAND' TO MOUTH.          19 I advanced my head boldly, and caught the Blond Head on the wing. It was retreating after the usual fashion, and with the usual rapidity, when I shot it with the word,- "Stay! i" It fluttered for an instant, and then remained still. "We are neighbors," I remarked to the Blond Head. It was a truism, I know, but still it was a remark. After all, what does it matter what you say to most women, so that what you say is a remiark? "So I perceive," answered the Head, still fluttering a little. "May I have the honor of knowing - "I commenced. "Certainly," interrupted the Blond Head, "I am Rosamond." "The fair Rosamond, I see," I interposed, in my gallantest man- ner. "Yes," replied Rosamond, with wonderful naivete, " fair perhaps, but very unhappy." "Unhappy! How?   Can I relieve you,-be ofany service?" A glance of suspicion was shot at me from a pair of large, lus- trous blue eyes. u Are you not one of his satellites?" asked the Blond Head. a I a satellite?"I answered indignantly, - c I am no one's sat- ellite, -unless indeed it be yours," I added; "for I would gladly /  revolve round so fair a planet." "Then you are not a friend of Count Goloptious?" ( No. I never saw him until last night. He brought me to this hotel, where I have been bewildered by enchantments.! "All my doing! all my doing!" cried Rosamond, wringing her hands. ' How your doing?"I inquired, with some astonishment, "I am the artist, - the fatal, the accursed artist. It was I who painted, I who modelled." "Painted, modelled what?" I- Iush! you can save me, perhaps. I will see you again to-day. Is not the Eye watching you*? 7  ^ I have magnetized it."   &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6538-00000011"/> 20          GOOD STORIES. "Good! you are a clever fellow," and, Rosamond's eyes sparkled. "You must help me to escape." "From what?" "I will tell you -but quick! shut your window. Count Go- loptious is coming." The Blond Head gave me a sweet smile, and retreated. I did likewise, and closed my window. The next moment my door opened, and Count Goloptious entered. VII.-THREE COLUMNS A DAY. COUNT GOLOPTIOUS entered. He seemed somewhat agitated, and banged the door to loudly. The shock dispelled the magnetic slumber of the Sentinel Eye, which suddenly opened its heavy lid and glared around with an expression which seemed to say, "I'd like to catch anybody saying that I have been asleep!" "Sir," said the Count, " you have been misconducting yourself." "I? Misconducting myself! What do you mean, Count Golop- tious?" "You have been singing love-songs, sir. In a tenor voice, too. If you were a bass I would not so much care, but to sing tenor, - it's infamous!" The blue goggles of the Count seemed to scintillate with anger as 1he glared at me. "What the devil is the meaning of all this mystery?"I demand- ed angrily, for I really was getting savage at the incomprehensibil- ity of everything that surrounded me. "What do your infernal eyes and hands and ears and mouths mean? If you are a night- :mare, why don't you say so, and let me wake up? Why can't I sing love-songs if I like, - and in a tenor voice, if I like? I 'll sing alto if I choose, Count Goloptious." It is not for you to penetrate the mysteries of the Hotel de Coup d'CEil, sir," answered the Count. "You have enjoyed its hos- pitalities, and you can go.- You have sung tenor songs, sir. You ,          .               e .   FR(O1M HAND TO MOUTH.              - know, as well as I, the influence of the tenor voice upon the female heart. You are familiar with the history of the- opera, sir. You have beheld penniless Italians, with curled mustaches, and with no earthly attraction except a peculiar formation of the windpipe, wreck the peace of the loveliest of our females. There is a female in this vicinity, sir. A poor, weak-minded girl, who has been placed under my guardianship, and who is crazy on the subject of music. You have been singing to her, sir. Yes, with that ac- cursed mellifluous voice of yours, - that vocal honey in which you tenors administer the poison of your love, - with that voice, sir, you are endeavoring to destroy the peace of mind of my ward. You have slept here, sir. You can go now." "I have not the slightest intention of going now, Count Golop- tious. - This hotel suits me admirably well. It has certain little drawhacks to be sure. It is not pleasant to be always overlooked and overheard in one's privacy." Here I pointed to the Ear and the Eye. "But still one can grow accustomed to that, I suppose. By the way, I should like some breakfast." AMy coolness took the Count completely by surprise. He stared at me without being able to utter a word. The fact was, that the Blond Head had bewitched me. Those clouds of golden hair that enfolded the wondrous oval of her face like a continual sunset had set my heart on fire. Never, never would I quit that hotel, unless I bore her with me. She had hinted at misfortune in our brief in-  terview. She was a captive,--a captive of the false Count, who now pretended that he was her guardian. Meshed in the countless spells and enchantments that surrounded her, she was helpless as those fair creatures we read of in the Arabian Nights. I would be her rescuer. I would discover the charm before which the bonds should melt. It was Andromache and Perseus and the sea-mon- ster over again, in the year 1858. The Count, it is needless to say, was the monster. I had no Medusan shield, it is true, but I felt powerful as Perseus, for all that. My blond Andromache should be saved. "So you won't go, eh?" said Goloptious, after a long silence.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6538-00000012"/>      E    GO-ODY STORIES. - -No."    - You had better." "This is a hotel. I have a right to accommodation here as long as I pay for it. Hotels belong to the public, when the public has money." ( I know I can't force you to go, but I don't think, young sir, that you will be able to pay for your board." s How much do you charge here, by the day? A ' Three columns a day." "Three what?" - Three columns a day." - I have heard of pillar dollars, but hang me if I ever heard of money that was called columns." "We don't take money in pay at the Hotel de Coup d'CEil. Brain is the only currency that passes here. You must write me three columns of the best literary matter every day; those are our terms for this room. We have rooms higher up which rent for less. Some go as low as a paragraph. This is a four-column room usually, but you can have it for three." Was the fellow laughing at me? His countenance was perfectly teroushe-vhjole time he was speaking. He talked as deliberate- ly as if he had been a simple hotel clerk talking to a traveller, who was about pricing rooms. The whole thing struck me so comically that I could not refrain from a smile. I determined to carry the thing out in the Count's own vein. ( Meals are of course included?"I said inquiringly. Certainly, and served in your own room." "I don't think the apartment dear," I continued, inspecting my chamber with a critical eye. "I 'll take it." aVery good"; and I saW a gleam  of gratified malice shoot through the Count's great blue goggles. ' Now," said I, " perhaps you will inform me, Count Goloptious, why a few moments since you were so anxious to get rid of me, and why now you so tranquilly consent to my remaining an inmate of the Hotel de Coup d'CEil?"    [ F1?0MSAROMH-D AND-. TO---MOUTH .       b "I have my reasons," said the Count, mysteriously. "You have now taken a- room in the Hotel de Coup d'CEil; you will never quit it unless with my consent. The Eye shall watch you, the Ear shall hear you, the Hands shall detain you, the Mouths shall betray you; work is henceforth your portion. Your brain is my property; you shall spin it out as the spider his web, until you spin out your life with it. I have a lien on your intellect. There is one of my professions which I omitted in the catalogue which I gave you on our first meeting, - I am a Publisher!" VIII. -THE BLOND HEAD. THS last speech of the Count's, I confess, stunned me. He was then a publisher. I, who for years had been anxiously keeping my individuality as an author intact, who had been strenuously avoid- ing the vortex of the literary whirlpool of which the publisher is the centre, who had resisted, successfillly, the absorbing process- by which that profession succeeds in sucking the vitals out of the literary man, now suddenly found myself on the outer edge of the maelstrom, slowly but surely revolving towards the central funnel which was to swallow me. An anticipation of unknown misfortunes seemed to overwhelm me. There was something sternly prophetic in the last tones if Goloptious's voice. He seemed to have had no turtle in his throat for several days. He was harsh and strident. I determined to consult with the Blond Head in my extremity. It would, at least, be a consolation to me to gaze into those won- drous blue eyes, to bask in the sunshine of that luminous hair. I raised my window, and hummed a bar of Coro'e Gentil. In a moment the adjoining window was raised, and out came the Blond Head. The likeness to the weather-toy existed no longer: both our heads were out together. "You have seen Goloptious," said the Blond Head. What did he say?"  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6538-00000013"/> "Excuse me from continuing the conversation just at this mo- aent," I replied. "I have forgotten something." I had. The Ear and the Eye were in full play,- one watching, he other listening. Such witnesses must be disposed of, if I was o hold any secret conversation with Rosamond. I retired there- ore into my chamber again, and set to work to deliberately mag- tetize the eye. That organ did not seem to relish the operation t all, but it had no resource. In a few moments the film over- pread it, and it closed. But what was to be done with the ear? could not magnetize that. If, like the king in Hamlet, I had  ,nly a little poison to pour into it, I might deafen it forever. Or, ike the sailors of Ulysses, when passing the island of the Sirens -ah! Ulysses! - that was the idea. Stop up the ear with wax! Wly bedroom candle was not all burned out. To appropriate a ,ortion of that luminary, soften it in my hands, and plaster it over he auricular' organ on my door was the work of a few moments. t was a triumph of strategy. Bdth my enchanted guardians com- letely entrapped, and by what simple means! I now resumed my out-of-window conversation with Rosamond vith a feeling of perfect security. "I have seen Goloptious," I said, in reply to her previous ques- ion, " and am now a boarder in the Hotel de Coup d'CEil." "Great heavens, then you are lost!" /exclaimed Rosamond, haking her cloudy curls at me. "Lost! How so?" "Simply that you are the slave of Goloptious. He will live on rour brains, until every fibre is dried up. You will become a nental atrophy,- and, alas! worse." "What do you mean?   Explain, for Heaven's sake. You nystify me." "I cannot explain. But we must endeavor to escape. You tre ingenious and bold. I saw that by the manner in which you )vercame the Sentinel Eye by magnetism. This hotel is a den of mnchantments. I have been confined here for over a year. 5My Profession is that of a sculptor, and I have been forced to model   all those demon hands and mouths and ears with which the build- ing is so thickly sown. Those weird glances that strike througha , the countless corridors from the myriad eyes are of my painting. Those ten thousand lips that fill this place with unearthly murmurs are born of my fingers. It is I, who, under the relentless sway of' Goloptious, have erected those enchanted symbols of which you are the victim. I knew not what I did, when I made those things. But you can evade them all. We can escape, if you ill only set your ingenuity to work." "But, really, I see nothing to prevent our walking down stairs." "There is everything. You cannot move in this house without each motion being telegraphed. The Hands that line the staircase would clutch your skirts and hold you firm prisoner, ere you to attempt to leave." "The Hands be -dished!"I exclaimed. At this moment there came a knock. I hastily drew my head in, and opened my door. I beheld the Hand of the night before, plead- lingly extended; and at the same moment a running fire of mur- murs from the Mouths informed me that he wanted the gold ring I had promised him. It was evident that this infernal hand would dun me to all eternity, unless he was paid. I rushed to the window in my despair. "Romond! fair Rosamond! I shouted. "Have you got a gold ring?" Certainly," answered the Blond Head, appearing. "Stretch as far as you can out of your window and hand it to me." "Alas, I cannot stretch out of the window." " "Why not?" "Do not ask me,  oh! do not ask me," answered the Blond Headl, with so much angcuisli in her tones that I inwardly cursed myself for putting so beautiful a creature to pain. "But," I continued, "if I reach over to you with a pair of tongs, will you give it to me?" "O, with pleasure!" and the Blond Head smiled a seraphic smile smldaer                      i  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6538-00000014"/> A pair of tongs being adjacent, a plain gold ring was quickly 9 transferred from Rosamond's slender finger to my hand. With much ceremony I proceeded to place it on the smallest finger of the Hand, not being able, however, to get it farther than the first joint. Even i this partial decoration seemed however to meet with approval, for A the ten thousand hands commenced applauding vigorously, so much i so that for a-moment I fancied myself at the opera.      i "( Good heavens!"I thought, " what a claque these hands would l make!"                            m There was one thing, however, that puzzled me much as I re- g entered my room. Why was it that Fair Rosamond could not lean out of the win- dow?  There was some mystery about it, I felt certain. I little ! thought in what manner or how soon that mystery was to be solved.           -             -  IX. - ROSAMOND MAKES A GREEN BIRD. No sooner was my debt to the Hand thus satisfactorily acquitted, than, in the elation of the moment at having for the first time in my ' life paid a debt on the appointed day, I immediately applied my lips to the Ear on the inside, and communicated my desire for some pens, ink, and paper. In an incredibly short space of time, the Hands, doubtless stimulated by the magnificence of my reward, passed a quantity of writing materials up the stairs, and in a few moments I was at work on my three columns, being determined from that time not to fall into arrears for my board. "It is of the utmost importance," I thought, "that I should be unfettered by pecuniary liabilities, if I would rescue Rosamond from the clutches of this vile Count. I feel convinced of being able to baffle all his enchantments. Yes, Hands, ye may close, Ears, ye may listen, Eyes, ye may watch, Mouths, ye may scream the alarm, but I will deceive ye all! There is no magician who can out- conjure the imagination of man." Having mentally got rid of this fine sentence, I set myself regu-   larly to work, and in a short space of time dashed off a stunning article on the hotel system of England as contrasted with that of* America. If that paper was ever printed, it must have astonished the reader; for written as it was, under the influence of the enchant- ments of the Hotel de Coup d'CEil,it mixed up the real and the ideal in so inextricable a manner, that it read somewhat like a fusion of alternate passages from Murray's guide-book and the Arabian Nights' Entertainments. Such as it was, however, it being finished, I folded it up and sent it by the Hand, with my compliments to Count Goloptious, begging that heshould at the same time be in- formed that i was hungry, and wantd my breakfast. ly messge whirred along the ten thousand leuths,' and faded away down into the hall below. I had scarcely re-entered my apartment when I heard the Blond head open the window, and commence singing a strange wild sort of recitative, evidently with the view of attracting my attention.

"Ah! until the hour of my delivery arrives, he shall be fed i daintily on preserved butterflies, and shall scrape his bill on a shell  of pearl!"

It was a charming i bird. Its shape was somewhat like that of the mocking-bird,-- long, slender body, piquant head, and sweeping tail. Its color was of the most dazzling green, and its feathers shone like satin. : "Good morning, pretty bird," said I, holding out my finger to  my visitor, who immediately flew to my hand and established him- self there. "Good- morning," answered the Green Bird, in a voice so like Rosamond's that I was startled; "I am come to breakfast with you." As the Green Bird spoke, a small bright feather dropped from its i! wing, and fell slowly to the ground. "I am delighted to lave your society," I replied, with the utmost courtesy, "but I fear that I shall not be able to offer you any a preserved butterflies. Nay, I have not as much as a beetle in a pickle."    -J "Don't mention it," said the bird, with an off-hand flirt of his tail; "I can put up with anything. Besides, you know, one can always fall back on eggs."  To my surprise another bright green feather disengaged itself from the bird's plumage, and floated softly towards the carpet.   FROM HAND TO MOUTH.            29 "Why, you 'll lose all your feathers," said I. "Are you moult- i, ing?" "No," answered the bird, " but I am gifted with speech on the condition that I shall lose a feather every time I use the faculty. When I lose all my feathers, which I calculate will not take place for about a year, I shall invent some artificial ornithological cover- ing." "Gracious!"I exclaimed, " what a figure - of speech you will be!" At this moment the usual knock was heard at my door, on open- ing which I discovered a large tray covered with a snowy cloth, on which were placed a number of small porcelain covers, some bottles of red and white wine, a silver coffee-service, in short, everything necessary for a good breakfast. X.- BREAKFAST, ORNITHOLOGICALLY CONSIDERED. IN a few moments my repast was arranged on the table, at which I seated myself, the Green. Bird perching on the edge of a pretty dish of scarlet fruits at which he pecked, occasionally moistening his golden bill in the slender glass of Barsac which I placed near him.

It would indeed present rather a ridiculous appearance, if at six o'clock in the morning I were to sally out, and run all over the fields turning up stones in order to find fried smelts, and diving  into a rabbit burrow in the hope of discovering mutton chops en  papillotes." ' If I were a man," said the Green Bird, sententiously, "I would have my meals carefully concealed by the servants in various  places, and then set to work to hunt them out. I would be twice as healthy as the present indolent method." Here he took another sip at the Barsac, and looked at me so queerly that I began to have a shrewd suspicion that he was drunk.  g  A brilliant idea here flashed across my mind. I would intoxicate- the Green Bird, and worm out of him the reason why it was that the Blond Head was never able to stretch farther out of her win- dow than the shoulders. The comicality of a drunken bird also made me favorable to the idea. "As far as eating goes," said I, "I think that you are perhaps right; but as to drinking, you surely will not compare your insipid ' dew to a drink like this!" and, as I spoke, I poured out a glass of Richebourg, and handed it to the bird.  He dipped his bill gravely in it, and took one or two swallows. "It is a fine wine," he said sententiously, ' but it has a strong body. I prefer the Barsac. The red wine seems to glow with the  fires of earth, but the white wine seems illumined by the sunlight of heaven.".                            I And the Green Bird returned to his Barsac. XI. - LEG-BAIL. "So the fair Rosamond made you," I said carelessly.  "Yes, from terra-cotta," answered the Green Bird; " and, haviaig- , :;-:.-  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6538-00000017"/> been baked and colored, I came to life in the sun.- I love this white wine, because the sun, who is my father, is in it"; and he took another deep draught. , What'induced her to construct you?"I asked. "Why, with a view of escaping from this place, of course." "O, then you are to assist her to escape?" "Not at all, -you are to assist her. I will furnish her with the means." "What means?" "With the wings." "The what?"I asked, somewhat astonished. "The wings!" " cWhat the deuce does she want of wings? She is not going to escape by the window, is she?" "Ha, h h, ha! Ho, ho, ho! He asks what Rosamond wants of wings!" And the bird, overcome with laughter at the ludicrous- ness of some esoteric jest, tumbled into his glass of Barsac, from which I rescued him draggled and dripping, all the more draggled as during our conversation he had been continually shedding. his feathers. "Well, what does she want of wings?"I asked, rather angrily, because a man does not like to see' people laughing at a joke into the secret of which he is not admitted. "To fly with," replied the Green Bird, nearly choking with the involuntary draught, of white wine he had swallowed during his immersion. "But why does she want to fly?"  "Because she has no legs, --that's the reason she wants to fly,  said the bird, a little crossly. "No legs!"I repeated, appalled at this awful intelligence,-" no legs! O, nonsense! you must be joking." "No, I'm choking," answered the Green Bird. "Why, she is like Miss Biffin, tlten, born without legs. Heav- ens! what a pity that so lovely a head shouldn't have a leg tO -tead p -!                            "She was n't born without legs;, replied: the Bird, f:Her;-!*t  i are- down stairs."  "You don't mean to say that they have been amputated?"    : No. Count Goloptious was afraid she would escape, and as he  . wanted only her bust, that is, her brain, hands, and arms, hejusft : took her legs away and put them in the store-room.

I sha'n't have a feather left- soon if I go on at this rate. By the way, where is your mirror I must reproduce myself." XII.- HOLDING THE MRROR UP TO NATURE.- I HANDED the Green Bird a small dressing-glass which lay on the bureau, --I mean, I placed it before him, for the impossibility of  handing a bird anything will strike even the most uncultivated mind, -and seated myself to watch his proceedings with a considerable  ] amount of curiosity. I wish, before proceeding any further, to make a few random re- : marks on the looking-glass in America.  I take a certain natural pride in my personal appearance. :It is- i of no consequence if my nose is a trifle too long, my chin too re--  treating, or my head too angular. I flatter myself that the ele-: gance of a man's appearance does not depend on his individual traits, but upon his tout ensemble.

Like Proteus, I find myself changing my shape wherever I go. At the Bunkum House, I am a fat boy. At the St. Bobolink, a living skeleton. Once I was seriously alarmed on inspecting my- self for the first time in the glass, - on an occasion when I had just taken possession of a new boarding-house, - at discovering that one of my eyebrows was in the middle of my forehead. I had been informed by a medical student, - since plucked, - from whom I de- rived most of my chirurgical information, that paralysis not unfre- quently produced such effects. I descended in some trepidation to the parlor, where I had an interesting interview with my landlady, who succeeded in removing the unpleasant impression from my mind that I was a victim to that unbecoming disease. The glass was not, however, changed, and I never looked in it and beheld that eyebrow in the middle of my forehead, without the disagreeable sensation that in the end I should die a Cyclops. The glass which I placed before the Green Bird possessed, I re- gret to say, certain defects in the plane of its surface, which ren- dered -self-contemplation by its aid anything but an agreeable occupation. I know no man egotist enough to-- as the novels say --" spend hours before " such a mirror.  The Green Bird, as soon as he beheld himself in this abominable mirror, uttered a scream of disgust. I must say, that, on looking over his shoulder, the image formed by him in the glass was not a graceful one. He was humped, one leg was shorter than the other, and his neck looked as if it had just been wrung by a school-boy. What attracted my attention most, however, were certain pecu- liarities in the reflected image itself. It scarcely seemed a reflec- tion. It was semi-substantial, and stood out from the surface of the glass in a sort of half-relief, that grew more and more positive ev- j ery moment.- In a few seconds more, the so-called image detached 7 't4E' i ..stl?.S-    itself from the mirror, and hopped out on the table, a perfect coun- terpart of the Green Bird, only humped, with one leg shorter than the other, and a wry neck. It was an ornithological caricature. The Green Bird itself now sidled away from its position before the mirror, and the Caricature Bird took his place. If the image cast by the former was distorted, no words can convey the deformi- ty of the image cast by the latter. It was a feathered cripple. It :  was all hump. It stood on one long attenuated leg. Its neck was tortuous as the wall of Troy.  This rickety, ornithological image produced itself in the mirror, in precisely the same fashion as did its predecessor, and, after grad- ually growing into substance, detached itself from the polished sur- face, and came out upon the table, taking its position before the mirror, vice the first humpback resigned. What the image cast by the third bird was like I cannot at all attempt to portray. It was a chaos of neck and humps and feath- ers. The reproduction, nevertheless, went on, and the prolific mir- ror kept sending forth a stream of green abortions, that after a little while were no longer recognizable as belonging to any species of animal in the earth below, or the heavens above, or the caverns that lie under the earth. They filled my room. Swarms of limping, wall-eyed, one-legged, green-feathered things hustled each other on the floor. My bed was alive with a plumed mass of deformity. They filled the air, making lame efforts at flight, and blindly fall- ing to the floor, where they tumbled about in inextricable confusion. i The whole atmosphere seemed thick with green feathers. Myriads    i of squinting eyes glittered before me. Quintillions of paralytic yel- low bills crookedly gaped at me. I felt myself treading on a thick carpet of soft, formless life. The fluttering of embryonic wings, the twittering of sickly voices, the ruffling of lustreless plumages, produced a continuous and   I vague sound that filled me with horror. I was knee-deep in the creatures.  From out the distorting mirror they poured in a con-  stant stream, like a procession of nightmares, and the tide-mark of - this sea of plumage rose higher and higher every instant, .

Nestling in my hair. Crooning their loathsome notes into my ear. Filling my pockets, and brushing with their warm fuzzy breasts against -my cheek. I grew wild with, terror, and, making one desperate effort, struggled through the thick mass of life -that pressed like a wall around me to the,-window, and, flinging it open, cried -in a despairing voice: "Rosamond! Rosamondn! Save me, Rosamond!" XIII.- A  STUPID CHAPTER, AND I KNOW IT. "WHAT 's the matter?" cried the Blond Head, appearing at her window, with all her curls in a flurry. "Your Green Bird," I answered, " has been misconducting him- self in the most abominable manner. He - " "-You surely have not let him get at a mirror?" screamed Rosa- mond. "Unfortunately I have; and pretty things he has been doing with it. My room is full of Green Birds. If you don't call them away, or tell me how to get rid of them, I shall be killed, as the persons suspected of hydrophobia were formerly killed in Ireland, that is, I shall be smothered by a feather-bed." "What a wretch of a bird to waste himself in such a foolish way, when he was so particularly wanted! But rest a moment; I will rid you of your unpleasant company." So saying, Rosamond withdrew her head from the window, and in a second or two afterwards a long shrill whistle came from her room, wild and penetrating as the highest notes of the oboe. The instant the Green Birds heard it, they all commenced jostling and crushing towards the open window, out of which they tumbled in a continual stream. As scarcely any of them could fly, only a few succeeded in reaching the sill of Rosamond's casement,-the goal towards which they all struggled. The rest fell like a green cata- ract on--the hard- flags with-which the yard underneath my window            UFROM HaNo DoTU MOUTH.      - was paved. In this narrow enclosure' they hustled, and eraewkd, and limped, and writhed, till the place, filled with such a mass of feathered decrepitude, resembled an ornithological Cour des Miracles. So soon as my room was cleared of the bird multitude, I com- menced sweeping up the mass of green feathers which lay on the floor, and which had been shed by the original Green Bird, during his conversation with me at breakfast. While engaged in this task, I I heard a laugh which seemed to come from: my immediate neigh- T borhood. I turned, and there sat the Green Bird on the mantel- \ piece, arranging what feathers he had left with his bill. "What," I said, "are you there? Why, I thought you had gone  with the rest of them!"  "Go with such canaille as that set!" answered the Green Bird, indignantly. "Catch me at it! I don't associate with such crea- tures."                     . -  "Then, may I ask, why the deuce did you produce all this ca- naille in my room, Green Bird?"  "It was your own fault. I intended to produce a few respec- table and well-informed Green Birds, who would have been most  1- entertaining society for you in your solitude, and materially aided- you in your projects against Count Goloptious.

"'No, thank you," politely replied the Green Bird. "I have drank enough already. About those feathers " (I had just swept the green feathers up into a little heap),- what are you going to do with them?" "To burn them, of course. I can't have them  littering my room." "My dear sir," said the Green Bird, " those feathers are im- mensely valuable. They will be needed to make Rosamond's wings. Put them into one of the drawers of the bureau, until they are 8 wanted,"  I obeyed. XIV.-ON THE ADVANTAGES OF MARRYING A WITCH. "Now," continued the bird, " what are your plans for escape?"  "I have n't any, except a general idea of throttling Goloptious  the next time he comes in here, gagging the Mouths, handcuffing the Hands, and bunging up all the Eyes, and then bolting some- where or other with the Blond Head, --that is, if we can recover her legs, - say to Grace Church, where, with the blessing of Brown, we can become man and wife."

I need never go to see Professor Wyman, or Herr Dobler, or Robert Houdin. I can get up a little Parlor Magic whenever I choose. Fancy the pleasure of having Genii for servants, just like Aladdin!

Genii have no cousins, I believe. iHappy were the people in the days of Haroun Al Raschid. "On these grounds I esteem it a privilege to marry a witch.

So you intend to marry Rosamond," remarked the Green Bird, with the slightest sneer in the world. "Certainly. Why not?":  "I don't see how you're to do it.

"An excellent speech for Ravel to make,". replied the Green Bird, " but I fancy that your education as an Acrobat has been neglected." "I think I see at what you are aiming," I answered. i'You want to make terms. How much do you want to assist Rosamond and myself to escape? I learn from her song that you know the ropes."

"You shall have as much hemp-seed as you can eat." "Excellent." "And as much Barsac as you can drink."

"I am aware of that fact." "It is necessary that you should visit Rosamond's room." "I would give my life to accomplish such a call."

Order them at the Ear, and when you get them I will show you how to use them"; and the Green Bird H ruffled out his feathers and gave himself airs of mystery. I immediately went to the Ear, and, removing the wax with which I had deafened it, ordered the articles as prescribed.

WHLE awaiting the arrival of the desired articles, I heard Rosa- mond calling me through the window. I immediately obeyed the summons. "' An idea has just struck me," said the Blond Head. "I am ex- ceedingly anxious, as you know, to get away from here, and I have- I no doubt with your aid might succeed in doing so, but how am I to take my trunks?" "Your what?" Trunks.

I have known, in the early days of my novel-reading, a young lady run through six volumes, in the-course of which she was lost in forests, im- mersed in lakes, and imprisoned in dungeons, in a single white skirt and nothing on her head. I often thought what a color that white skirt must have been at the end of the novel." "O," said Rosamond, "I have quite a wardrobe here." "Well, I'm afraid you 'll have to leave it behind." "What! leave all those ducks of dresses behind! Why, I'd rather stay here forever than part with them. It's so like a man to say, in the coolest manner in the world, ' Leave them behind."' And the Blond Head here agitated her curls with a certain trem- ulous motion, indicative of some indignation. "My dear, you need not be angry," I said soothingly. "Per- haps, after all, we can manage to get your trunks away also. How much luggage have you got?" I will read you the list I made of it," answered Rosamond. This is her list, --I jotted it down at the time in pencil. The remarks are my own:- One large trunk, banded with iron, and containing my evening dresses. One large square trunk containing my bonnets, two dozen. (The excusable vanity of an individual having nothing but a head.) One cedar chest containing my furs. (At this point I ventured a joke about a cedar chest being a great deal too good for such mink- ses. I was promptly suppressed by the dignified statement that they were sables,) One circular box for carrying the incompressible skirt. (Doubt- less an expansive package.) A bird-cage. A case for artificial flowers. A feather case. (Containing the last feather which is supposed to be fatal to the Camel.) A willow basket for bonnets. (More bonnets!)

(What male who has ever travelled with a lady does not remember with terror her small parcels?

In the cars, you have to stow them away under the seat so that you have no room for your legs. Woe to you if one is lost or mislaid. It always contains the very thing of all others which the owner would not have lost for worlds.) A bandbox. (The bandbox is the most terrible apparatus con- nected with the locomotion of females. It refuses utterly to accom- modate itself to travel. Its lid comes off. It will fit into no shaped vehicle. Of its own accord it seems to place itself in posi- tions favorable to its being sat upon. When crushed or in any way injured, it is capable of greater shabbiness of appearance than any other article of luggage.) A dressing-case. A portable bath. An easel. (Easily carried.) Three boxes of books. (A porter who was once removing my luggage called my attention to the weight of the box in which I had packed my books. They were certainly very heavy, and yet I had selected them with the greatest care.) Here Rosamond stopped, and then proposed going over the list again, as she was sure she had forgotten something. I respectfully declined the repetition, but asked her by what pos- sible means she expected to transport such a quantity of luggage out of the Hotel de Coup d'CEil.

"I never thought of that," said Rosamond, gravely. "' A misfit would be horribly uncomfortable." XVI. -A THRILLING CHAPTER. WE were certainly in a very unpleasant fix. To go down stairs on a wild-goose chase among the bins in search of the legs of the Blond Head would be anything but agreeable. "Can you not make any pair do for the present?"I asked. "Any pair?  Certainly not, Could you get along with any other head but your own?"  The question rather took me aback. I confessed that such a change was not at all to be desired. "C Then go," said the Blond Head, " and search for them." "Faint heart," etc.; a musty adage came into my head, and I answered, "I will do so."

"Silence!" said the Green -Bird, and a falling feather aroused an echo that sounded like the beating of an hundred drums; " speak not if you would succeed!" In silence I followed on through the cavernous chamber with its pitchy walls,--on, still on. At last a small blue light appeared burn- ing in the distance like the eye of a tiger. As we approached, it gradually increased in size, until, at last, as we neared it, it became magnified into an opening some sixty feet wide. Beyond, burned a lake of deadly blue sulphur, shedding a pale unearthly light. As we passed through the opening, a figure suddenly ap- peared before us. It was that of an old man. He carried a stick in his right hand, and walked with a feeble gait, but, what struck me as rather peculiar, his head, instead of being on his shoulders, he carried under his left arm. "Who are you?" he asked, speaking from the head under his arm. "I am an author," I replied. "Look there?" he said, as he pointed to the burning lake, I looked, and beheld what I had not before noticed. It was in- habited. Hundreds of poor wretches were there, burning and writhing in the seething flame. "Who are those wretched beings?"I queried, in terror. "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the old man. 4"Those are authors!"' "Why doomed to a residence here?" "Because, when on the earth beyond, they failed to fulfil their mission. They lost sight of their goal. They digressed from'the path of honor. They-" "I see. They went it blind." "Exactly." "There," and he pointed to a floating head- near the edge of the ,   *  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6538-00000024"/> lake,-" there is a plagiarist. His is the A No. 1 degree. There," and he pointed to another, "is one who published and edited a newspaper." His offence?"I asked. "Black-mailing. There is one who wrote flash novels." "Jack Sheppard. The Bhoys," I muttered. "Ay; you be wise; avoid the broad path; keep faith; be true. And now what seek you here?" I told him my errand. "And you hope to find the legs?" "I do." "Come, then, with me. Here, carry my head." I took the head, and, with the Green Bird by my side, followed the singular old man. He led us round by the lake, so close that, at times, the heat seemed to scorch my clothing. Presently he stopped opposite a great door of blue veined marble. Pushing that open, we entered a large and brilliantly lighted apartment. Here, upon every side, countless legs protruded from the wall.' As we entered, the legs all at once commenced kicking as though they would eject us from their abode. The old man took his head from us, and, putting it under his arm, commanded the legs to desist from their threatening attitudes. In an instant they all fell dormant. "Here," he said, " are the legs of all who have ever slept in the Hotel de Coup d'CEil, and here you will find those of the Blond Head." "But how am I to know them?"I said. "That I cannot tell you." "I can tell them," said the Green Bird, now speaking for the first time since we left the darkness; and it flew around the room, stopping to look at now one pair of legs, now another. At last it stopped opposite a remarkably crooked pair of limbs. "Here they are," he said. "Nonsense! it cannot be.  Such a beauty as the Blond Head never propelled on such pedals as those." e  .  .        I         ---------   c It is true," answered the bird. "Take them down, and see." I seized the legs, and with a sudden jerk pulled them from their place. What was my surprise on finding Count Goloptious before me. The legs were- his. "Ha!" he exclaimed, " you would trick me, but I have watched you. The Blond Head is safe." "Safe!"I echoed. "Ay, safe, safe in my stronghold, the Hotel de Coup d'CEil." "'T is false!" cried the Green Bird. "She -is here!" As it i spoke, it flew to a small door in the wall which I had not before noticed. Tapping with its beak against it, it opened instantly, and, looking in, I beheld the Blond Head complete. Never did I be- hold a being so beautiful as she seemed to me at that glance. Grace, beauty, voluptuousness, - well, imagine all the extensive descriptions of female loveliness you have ever read in two-shilling novels, put them all altogether, and pile on as much more, and then you have her description. "Fair Rosamond," I exclaimed, as I started forward to gain her, --"Fair Rosamond, you shall be saved." "Never!" cried Count Goloptious, --"never! Beware, rash youth! You have dared to criticise Italian opera, you have dared write political leaders, you have dared theatrical managers, you have dared a fickle public,- all this you have done, but brave not me. If you would be safe, if you value your life, go, depart in peace!" As he spoke, I felt the chivalric blood fast coursing through my veins. Go, and leave the fair being I loved in the power of a mon- ster? No, I resolved upon the instant that I would die with'her, or I would have her free. "Count," I exclaimed in passionate tones, "I defy thee. I will never forsake yon wretched lady." "Then your doom is sealed." He stamped three times upon the floor, and instantly the Green Bird disappeared. The place was wrapped in darkness. I felt myself borne through the murky, foul air of the cavern through which: we had first passed, with the rapid- - a .. - c-. ..- U4-. s  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6538-00000025"/> 48'         GOOD STORIES. ity of a cannon-ball. Emerging from it, I found myself in the arms of the Count; by his side stood the old man with his head under his arm. "Here," cried the Count, "is the nine hundred and twentieth. Eighty more, and we are free." A demoniacal laugh burst from the old man as he took me, un- able to resist him, from Goloptious. "Go, go to your brother authors, to the blue lake of oblivion. Go," he exclaimed with a sardonic bitterness, as he pitched me from him into the burning lake. A wild shriek. The burning sulphur entered my ears, my eyes, my mouth. My senses were going, when suddenly a great body, moving near, struck me. The liquid opened, and closed over me. I found myself going down, down. At last, I struck the bottom. One long scream of agony, and - XVII.- How IT ALL HAPPENED. "GOOD gracious! is that you? Why, how came you there?" "Dunno." "Bless me, you 've almost frozen. Come, up with you." "'What!

"You're a Green Bird, or you would n't lie there in the snow. Come, get up." In an instant I was awake. I saw it all. "What's the time?" I asked. "Just two!" Could all that have happened in an hour!

The cold had revived me, and I was now shivering. I arose. My friend and fellow-boarder, Dick Bunkler, who had been trip- ping, it on the light fantastic toe at a ball in the Apollo, was before me; and lucky it was for me that he had gone to that ball, for had I lain there all night, the probability is Coroner Connery would have made a V off my body, next day. "How came you to lie there outside the door?" asked Dick. "The door is fast; my night-key would n't work." Night-key! ha! ha! night-key " I looked at my hand, and beheld what?

WI3HLE I was at college, I chanced, one summer, to fall into habits of frequent and intimate intercourse with a young man, whose intellectual countenance and refinement of character never failed to exercise a winning influence, even upon the most cursory of his acquaintance. I may call our connection intimate; for I was the only one of our student set whom he ever asked to go and see him, or himself occa- sionally visited. But in our relations there was nothing of that wild, exuberant, often obtrusive kind of fraternizing affected by our studious youth. From that we were as far, when we parted in the autumn, as we had been on our first walk by thee Rhine, when the same road, and the same delight in the marvellous beauty of the spring scenery before us, had first introduced us to each other's notice. Even of his worldly circumstances I had learned but little. I had heard that he came of an ancient and noble house; that his boyhood had been passed at his father, Count --- 's castle, under the direction of a French tutor, with whom he had then been sent to travel, and finally, at his own express desire, to college. There lie had ascertained what he had, long suspected, viz. that in each and every branch of regular instruction he was totally deficient. Upon which, straightway he shut himself up with books and private tutors; suffered the tumult of loose Burschen-life to sweep by him, without once lifting his eyes from his task; and by the tiime I knew him lhe had got so far as to rise every morning with the Ethica of Aristotle, and to lie down at night with a chorus of Euripides. Not a shade of pedantry, not a taint of scholastic rust, was&#xD;<pb n="-51" xml:id="VAC6538-00000027"/>   left to clog the free play of his mind, at the close of all those years of sharp-set study. Numbers of industrious people work, because they do not know how to live; but his life was in his work; he took science in its plenitude, with all his faculties at once. He ac- knowledged no intellectual gain which did not tend to elevate his I  character, or which stood at variance with his mental instincts. In this sense, his was, perhaps, the most ideal nature I ever knew; if the term be not abused, as it too often is, to mean a vapid kind of beauty-worship, and a sentimental distaste for rough real- ities, but used in its loftier, and certainly far rarer sense, - an ideal standard of human character, resolutely upheld, and steadily pur- I sued; with undaunted spirit, if with moderate expectations; and, at whatever sacrifice of present brilliance and success, a thorough con- tempt of cram, as well as of every other form of professional narrow- mindedness. It is quite conceivable, therefore, that the coarser kind of student pleasures could not prove ensnaring to this young hermit, whose se- clusion came to be interpreted as aristocratic prejudice, from which no man could be more free. Education may have done something to confirm his natural aversion to all that was coarse, excessive, or impure. But as his scrupulous personal cleanliness was innate, so also was his almost maidenly delicacy in matters of morality. Never have I met such firmness of resolve, never so much masculine ener- gy of intellect, united to so girlish a reluctance to talk of love and love affairs. Consequently, he kept aloof from all those clamorous carouses, where, amidst the fumes of liquor and tobacco, liberty and patriotism, love and friendship, God and immortality, are, in their turns, discussed on the same broad basis of easy joviality as the last ball or the newest cut of college cap. Even in a tete-a-tete, where he could so eloquently hold forth on any scientific problem, he very rarely touched on questions dealing with the most private and per- sonal interests of man. History, diplomacy, politics, and the classics were subjects he would discuss with passionate eagerness. Then he could wax as warm and fluent in debate as though he were ad- dressing a listening nation he would have won to some great pur- -"An tx e- e-,  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6538-00000028"/> 52'         GOOD STORIES. pose. To things of common life he rarely referred. Of his own  family I never heard him speak. His father he mentioned only once. One evening, when I went to ask him whether he would join me in a row upon the river, -in one of those excursions of which lie was so fond, when we used to take a little boat to a tavern a mile or two below the town, and, after a frugal meal, walk home by starlight, - I found him just as he had thrown aside his pen and was struggling with the resolution necessary to dress for an evening  party. c Pity me!" he cried, as I came in; "only look at that magnifi- cent sunset, and imagine that I am doomed to turn my back upon it, and to go where -I shall see no other midnight splendor but that of the stars on dress-coats!" And he mentioned one of the most distinguished houses in the town, where a party was to be given iln honor of some passing dip- lonmate. 4' And must you?"I asked, with sincerest sympathy. For all our intinmacy, lwe had never come to saying thou. "'I must,^ he sighed; my father, who has set his heart on mak- ing a diplonate of me, whether I will or no, would be indignant if I were to go home without being able to inform him whether the sup- pers at Baron N.'s are still such as to justify their European repu- tation. Hitherto, I have been so culpable as to ignore them, and now, at the last, I have to fill up these blanks in my course of study." He saw me smile, and hastily added: "A y father, you must know, has, if possible, a still more uncivil opinion than I have of the liveried nonentities that stop the way in that kind of society; only what he finds wanting in them is not what I do. He is of the old school,-a diplomate of the Emrpire. He has seen the world in flames, and cannot forget the demoniac light by which he then saw all things, good and bad, fair and foul, high and low. Now the world is quiet, and regular enough, but sleepy, tame, and colorless. At least he thinks so. Still it is the world, and he who would rule in his generation must make himself acquainted with his subjects.   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.           53 He gave me very few maxims to take away with me, when I. came here; but this one, certainly, with fifty variations, 'Read men more than books.' When I was at your age,' he used to say, 'books played a very subordinate part in the world. I have known many a clever man who from the time he entered into society never read a line save the newest novel or the latest war- bulletin, and never wrote a syllable, except in love-letters or de- spatches. He had all the more time to act, or, if necessary, to think; and when is it not necessary to think?  But learning, -book- learning! we never thoughlt of such a thing, and yet we knew everything, of course. It was in the air; and where, now-a-days, you very soon get to the end of your Latin, our French took us a good way falrther.' "So I considered that as settled, and more than once I have girded up my loins to go and read these men and study tlhem. But after the first few pages I generally found out that their titles were the most important part, of them. Either I am a stupid reader, a 'kind reader' I know I am not!) or else the great world of the present day really is a most insipid study." His carriage came to the door, and I went away, for I had often noticed that it embarrassed him when any one was present while he was dressing. At a later hour, as I chanced to pass the house where the aris- tocracy of -- was to be assembled, I saw him getting out of the carriage. We exchanged a short look with a shade of irony; and then he went slowly up the carpeted steps, and I looked after him, while I felt proud of his knightly'bearing, and of the grace of his stalwart figure. He could be dangerous to womankind, as I had heard from sev- eral sources. They even told a story of a distinguished Englishwo- man, who, after divers attempts to win him,-attempts as fruitless as unequivocal, - had at last gone off in rage and undisguised despair, after having wrung her parrot's neck for screaming firom the wiln- dow, day and night, the name of the coy young Count. I was not able to learn more of this, nor of any other of his adl  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6538-00000029"/> 54           GOOD STORIES. ventures; he carefully avoided any conversation about women; still nothing he ever said could have led me to assume that he- thought meanly of them, or that he was suffering from any hidden wound, of which he could not bear the probing. Judging by the whole tenor of his conduct, I decided that, striv- ing as he did at aims so serious, he found no time for trifling flirta- tions, and never had been touched by a deeper feeling. His mother had died very soon after his birth; but he would occasionally re- ceive letters addressed in a feminine hand, and he told me they came from an old nurse of his, who had been as a second mother to him. She was evidently very dear to him; but even of her le spoke but little; eager discussions upon his own studies or on mine were ever burning on his lips. He was several years in advance of me, and when we parted in the autumn, he went to pass his diplomatic examination at Berlin. We bade each other a very affectionate farewell, without much hope of continued intercourse; we knew that what we had hitherto exchanged no correspondence could replace; but we were young, and we parted in the confident hope that life and its chances must, in some way or other, bring us together again. For many a long year I heard nothing of him but his name; the last I learned was from a newspaper, which stated that Count Er- nest -  had been appointed Secretary of Legation at Stockholm. Again a long time elapsed, without the smallest tidings of him, and I confess that his image had considerably faded in my memory, when it chanced that, on a pedestrian tour, I suddenly lit upon his name, printed upon a road-post that pointed to a deep lane all over- grown with brushwood, cutting at right angles the road which I had taken. I stopped, and, as if by a magician's wand, the country round me seemed metamorphosed. Again the Rhine was rolling at my feet, and again I saw his straight, lithe figure, as he walked along, holding his hat in his hand, and letting the fresh breeze from the current play among his luxu- riant hair of reddish gold; and those fine eyes of his, so full ot thought, gazing over the liver towards the mountains, until my   [-        ^UL/U1LV L J t-L^VDO k  J U1Vw Jj* voice would rouse him from his musings. This visionary play of memory lasted but a moment, and then an uncontrollable desire came over me to look upon that face once, more, and abundantly to make up for what I had lost so long. It was early in the afternoon; I hoped that I should not mistake the road, and never doubted but that, at this autumn season, I should find my friiend at home. He was an eager sportsman, and had spo- ken far oftener of the trees than of the persons he had known from childhood. I may have followed this ravine for about an hour, when it sud- denly occurred to me as strange that the road should be so neg- lected and overgrown; it was evident that no sort of carriage could possibly have passed this way for years. The foliage of past autumns lay mouldering in deep crevices; here and there a frag- ment of rock, or rotten branch, had been hurled from the edge by the winter storms; only in the firmest parts of the ground were oc- casional tracks of human passage. I sent my doubts to sleep, with the supposition that, long before this, some other and more level road must have been made between the castle and the plain. And yet, on entering the ravine, I had certainly ascertained that no nearer way was possible from the little manufacturing town I had left behind. At the summit of the pass, where half a dozen neg- lected paths diverged, I stopped in real perplexity. I climbed up a wide-armed beech-tree, and looked all round me.   A deep circular hollow lay before me, almost like a lake, filled with lovely bright green waves, of densest foliage. It was a vast forest of old beech-trees. Just in. the centre rose the turrets of the castle, over which the wilderness seemed to close. It was like a fairy tale, to see the spires and weathercocks glit- tering in the bright autumn sun, - as in those stories of sunken cas- tles, which show their pinnacles on some clear day, peeping from the hidden depths of water. There was not a sound of human life; the woodpecker tapped monotonously against the trees; a care- less deer ran past me, with more surprise than terror; while swarms of audacious squirrels among the branches were aiming at the intruder with the empty husks of beechnuts.  . . ,  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6538-00000030"/> 5-6 GOOD STORIES. I was on the point of giving it up, when, with a sharper look at the enchanted castle, I saw a thin thread of smoke, to inform me that it could not exclusively be harboring habrnbobgoblins. That the owner had not been here for ages might with some de- gree of certainty be surmised; but some sort of castellan or game- keeper might be there, and from him I hoped to hear some tidings of my friend and his welfare, and at least to spend a night in a home which he had loved with all his heart. I took one of these downward paths at a venture, and soon plunged into the strangest, darkest night of wood that ever stirredl above a wanderer's head. And in the night come dreams; and these soon wove a spell about me, and I qui forgot whence I had come, and whither I was going, and blindly left my legs to guide me, as they stepped uniformly on until they came to an involuntary halt at a broad stream whelre not a trace of path could be discerned; the tlrees stood thick, inter- lacing their branches withl the bruuslhwood, and forming an impene- trable barrier. I immediately turned back, and walked steadily upwards, until a path to the right again seduced me; then I tried another downwards, went astray again, and so went wandering, on for hours, making the whole round of the valley, without catchlling a single glimpse of the castle peeping through the thickets. The moon wras -already shining upon the tree-tops, and I made up my mind to pass the night in the airiest of lodgings. Suddenly, when I least expected it, the brushwood opened, and there, like an island in the midst of a lake of verdure, the old gray building stood square before me, with countless, glassless windows, but without one trace of human habitation. A broad stone bridge across the drlied-up moat reached righlt into the dark court, firolm wrhich t thethree square wings of the building rose ponderous and1 unadorned. Not a balcony nor jutting window was there to relieve the stern monotony of the walls; nothing but a gigantic coat-of-arms hewn in stone above the gateway, in which I recog- nized the bearings of a wrell-remembered signet-ring. Nearer to the roof, the castle wore a gayer aspect, the copper-   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.-          W plates about the gables shone mildly in the moonbeams, and the numerous chimney-tops, with weathercocks and flagstaffs, seemed all spangled over with silver. Nowhere a light, nor a window opened to the evening air; even the smoke I had seen upon the roof was gone. As I stood upon the bridge, and looked upon the rank vegetation, which, struggling upwards, was choking up the moat, and then at the forest pressing onwards to the very threshold of the castle, the thought would force itself upon me, that in fifty years or so all this vast work of human hands would be destroyed and overcome by the exuberance of nature; that these tall beeches would thrust their branches into the deserted halls, would take possession of the court, and sink their roots deep into the vaulted cellars, till, stone by stone, the whole fabric would give way, and again the forest reign alone. I entered the court-yard; and where the long grass that grew in the chinks between the paving-stones muffled the echo of my steps, I began to be sensible of a strange sound, proceeding from a small building that had been patched on beside the- bridge. At first I took it for the jarring of a shulitter shaken by the wind; and then I thought that noise could only be produced by some vigorous, deep bass snoring. I saw a light at one small window, and stole up to it to peep in. In a low room two men were seated at a table, with bottles and half-emptied glasses before them, and a pack of cards. One of them, huddled into at corner, had fallen asleep. The other sat leaning on his elbows, staring into the light with sleepy, snwinimin g eyes, a short pipe between his te'eth. Now and then he caught a fly and burned it at the candle, and hardly turned his head when he heard me at the window-pane. "What's the matter now?" he called, in a voice worn and- hollowed out by drunkenness; ; bid the Mamsell * send our supper, the Devil take her!"

Before I could speak, I heard another and a more gentle voice calling to me across the court: "Who is there? is a stranger , there?"I turned, and at the chief entrance I saw a female figure standing, whom, by the huge bunch of keys she carried at her gir- dle, I could not err in taking for the housekeeper. She was dressed all in black, - all but a tremendous cap, of which the broad, bright ribbons fluttered oddly about her delicate faded face. ,' Taking off my hat to her, I inquired as politely as I could, while I drew near, whether this really was the castle of Count Er- nest----, and, despite the deserted look, whether he might not j chance to be at home. I wished to be announced to himn as an old friend, although, to be sure, we had not met for years. The old lady stood looking at me for a while, with a melancholy searching gaze, and then she said: "This certainly is the castle of the Counts of -- , but my master, whom you seek, you will not find. It is two years since Count Ernest took leave of this place forever. Perhaps you are not aware that he is settled in Sweden? It is true," she added, after a pause, c' the world is very different to these woods; things that will keep sounding in my ears all my lifetime may be scarcely heard out there. But will you not come in? You cannot leave this place to-night, and you must be so kind as to put up with the little we have to offer. It used to be very different; in our hospitable days, guests used to be glad to stay a week. Since the castle has been kept in trust for the two little counts, all has gone to ruin. You have seen yourself, sir, the sinful way in which the forester and Monsieur Pierre kill the time. They clean out nothing but the cellars; and when I say a word of what is needful to be done, the villains turn upon their heels, and I might as well have spoken to the walls. I myself am old, and my eyes get worse and worse, so that I can hardly see to cleanliness and order as I should do. But pray come in, sir, and take a bite of something, and talk to me of my dear Count Ernest, of whom now I can only talk to empty rooms and pictures. Your visit will be the greatest favor /,ou can do me." I still stood on the steps before the great arched door, and felt   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.           59: strangely moved. This old woman's thin quavering voice,-and the weary blue eyes with which she looked so sadly on me, increased the dreariness of the place and sharpened the recollections that came crowding over me. "Y You are Mamsell Flor," I said, at last; " from whom my friend used to get letters when he was at college; he appeared to be very much attached to you." At these words her eyes overflowed at once. "Come," she said, and stretched out a slim, withered hand; "' I see you know me: we are old friends. I have been sadly wanting to see some kind and sympathizing face once more before I die. It is a long while to have lived only among servants, for indeed I have been used to better company." She led me across the dark entrance-hall,- and through a vaulted passage to a great hall, dimly lighted by a few candles. Two farm-servants and a maid were seate4 at a heavy stone table sup- ping, who stared astonished when they heard a strange voice wish- ing them good evening. My companion gave a few whispered orders to the maid, and turned to me again. "The provisions we have in the house are but poor," she said ; 'everything we want has to be brought for miles through the woods; and I myself require so little. But for one night, sir, you will not mind bad cookery. This hall, you see, was once a chapel, in old times, when the counts were Catholic; it was then left some time to dust and ruin, until at last Count Henry, our Count Er- nest's father, had the altar, the benches, and the pictures taken away, and an eating-room arranged. Youilcan still see the niche for the choristers over there, where the floor is raised and boarded. That is the master's table, at which Count Henry used to sup all his life, with the officials about the place, - the steward, the for- ester, and the castellan (not Monsieur Pierre then), and the bai- liff; and at this stone table I supped with the servants; we had crowds of them then. We never spoke a word, and the Count seldom asked a question. When he had company staying with him, the table was laid up stairs in the great saloon, as it always was at  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6538-00000032"/> I-ee- - --    GOOD STORIES. dinner, when he dined with the Countess. I will just light this can- delabrum on the master's table; who knows whether I shall live  to see it lighted again?"  She placed a heavy five-branched candelabrum of massive  silver on the table which she had laid with a snow-white damask  cloth, and shortly after a supper was served up, that might have  been far more frugal still and appeared excellent after my long wan- derings. Whilst I ate and drank, the old lady disappeared, and left me to my meditations. The men were already gone. I looked up into a twilight depth of desert space, broken by a few tall pointed windows, through which the moonbeams fell. The cross- vaults of the ceiling were supported by square pillars, fretted all over with antlers; and the same ornaments were placed at regular intervals along the walls, with a small tablet under eachl, recording the date of the shot, and the name of the shooter. What changes had the world not seen, from the days when the first high mass was celebrated here, to the present evening, when a stranger sits alone at a deserted table, counting these dust-worn trophies! I took the candelabrum to light myself along, while I went reading the-names on the little tablets, reaching about two centuries back. Counts and princes and princely prelates, even a few high-born dames, had been pleased to immortalize their luck. Presently I came to a well-known name, beneath a stately antler of four- teen:  "On the 20th of September, Count Ernest shlot this mighty stagr (who numbers as many antlers as the young Count years), in the glade by the deer's drought; Anno Domini 183-." Heavy steps now came sounding along the passages, and two men made their boisterous entrance. I immediately recognized the respectable pair of the watch-tower by the bridge. The farm-servants may have told them that there was a stranger in the house, and they had shaken themselves out of their drunken sleep, and come to assert their rights as guardians and watchmen. The castellan, Monsieur Pierre, blinking on me with his small, yellow, much inflamed eyes, measured me from head   -E'       1 COUNXT ERNEST'1S   O1ME.        6 to foot, with a very comical combination of sleepiness and impu- dence. He stammered out a few words in a hoarse coarse voice, in very indifferent IFrench; but he was soon talked down by his companion, who walked straight up to me, and, in the most brutal tone of official zeal, inquired who I was, and what I wanted. I dryly answered, that I was a friend of Count Ernest's, and had come to see the castle. Upon which straightway a change came over the spirit of the pair. The castellan commenced a series of crouching, cat-like obeisances, while the forester contrived to hit on the happiest transition from the most insolent aggressiveness to the respectful bluntness of the honest woodman. I perceived that I was taken for a far more important personage than I was, - for an emissary (no less!) from the family, come to hold an im- promptu inspection of the castle and its condition. The forester, officiously relieving me of the candlestick, forced me into a seat again, and sent a man to the cellar for a bottle of the best andl oldest; while, with a sly kick or a smothered imprecation, he made an occasional attempt to awaken his drowsy colleague to the full gravity of the situation. However, I did not care to be initiated into the details of the administration of woods and buildings, and I felt so much disgusted with the voluble servility of this precious pair of rogues, that I broke off suddenly, as soon as the old lady returned to the hall, and, excusing myself with the natural fatigue of a pedestrian, I begged her to light me to my room. She cast a look of meaning on the two, who were hardly to be prevented from following us up stairs. "' Did you see the face Monsieur Pierre made at me, sir? and how the forester took up his knife? Of course they are afraid that I should tell of them. Good Lord! as if one could not see with half an eye the state the place is in! I did once write about it to Sweden; but Sweden is a long way off, -too long, it would appear, for things to be remedied in this castle. When one has seen it in better days, one feels the worm that eats through wood and silk gnawing at one's very heart, sir!  ' It is high to climb," she apologized, as we came tothe third  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6538-00000033"/> steep fliight of stairs; " but I thought I would put you here, as you might like to sleep in the rooms in which Count Ernest grew up to be the man he is, and which he always preferred to any others. And they are more comfortable too, for I look after them myself, and carefully dust out every corner. And to-morrow morning, when you awake, you can see his favorite tree by the window; it has grown up so high meanwhile, that by reaching out your hand you can lay hold of it. Ah, and well-a-day! when we live to be old, we live. to see many a young child and many a young tree grow up and reach to Heaven, and leave us wearily to climb after them!" With these words we came to the top, where a long, low corridor ran past a range of garret rooms, hardly above a man's height. A covey of newly fledged bats, scared by the light, were flapping about against the ceiling. "There must be a hole somewhere in the roof," said the old lady, looking up, with a shake of her head; "I have told the man ten times and more to mend it. But he always pretends he can find no hole, and thus it is with every- thing." She opened a door, and showed me into a large, low room, where a light was burning on a chiffonier, and where the atmosphere was purer and more lifelike than without. "Here we are," she said. "Here he lived until he went on his travels with Monsieur Leclerc, and then again before lie went to college, and also the last time he was here. Everything is just as it used to be. That faded tapestry with the great hunting-pieces may have faded a trifle more; and the writing-table there, with the brass mountings, by the window - the wood-worm is making sad havoc of it. Every time I come, I find above an inch of yellow dust to sweep away. That is his own pretty blue water-bottle; and the gilded glass was a present from his tutor. I worked that little rug before:the bed, to give him when he was confirmed, and he never would allow it to be removed, long after the work was quite worn away. The bed is not his; I took his down stairs"; and, with a faint flush, that brought back a touching tint of youth to her refined old face, she added, " in that I sleep myself.'"   coUNiT ERNEST'S HOME.          63 ;Indeed, my dear Mamsell Flor," I said, "and he was worthy of being loved by a heart so faithful. He bore the stamp of his most ingenuous soul so clearly upon his noble brow, that even those who merely saw him pass could not choose but believe all good of him. By the time I knew him he had become reserved; but what must he have been to you, who reared him from his birth, and were to him as a mother! What happened to make him give up this place, and leave a home forever that used to be so dear to him?" She shook her head sadly, and sat down upon the sofa, as if the weight of all these rushing memories at once was too heavy to be borne standing. She remained awhile absorbed in thought; and then at last, taking an agate snuff-box from her pocket, she strength- ened herself with a pinch, before she answered. "4 It is a strange story, sir, which nobody can tell so well as I can; and I may tell it, now that the grass is growing over many a younger head than this old foolish one of mine. It will be nine- and-forty years at Christmas since I went up these stairs for the first time. I was the schoolmaster's daughter, a silly green young thing, and I thought I was being taken straight to heaven when our gracious Countess first took me into her service as a waiting- maid. The young Count was not born then, nor ever likely to be: there was little love between my master and my mistress. To be sure, my lady would always have been willing to worship him, for -all he' did to -vex her. But they were an ill-matched pair; and when Count Henry, who was almost always travelling about, came home in autumn for the shooting-season, he managed to make his pretty, patient wife still more unhappy than when he was away. "I had not been two days in the castle before I knew that my lady was suffering from some sore trouble; I used to find her pil- low wet of mornings, and her eyes all swollen with crying. l "For you see, sir, the Count was a gentleman who had a quick temper and a wild way of his own, and the Countess was meekness itself; she was too quiet for him, and he soon wearied of her. I suppose he had only married her to please his father. Some wilful, imperious, dark-eyed lady would have done better for him; some  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6538-00000034"/> "          GOOD STORIES. Frenchwoman or Spaniard, such as often came to visit at the cas- tle, who would have kept him at his wit's end, and made him hate her mortally to-day, and love her desperately to-morrow. He only loved what gave him trouble; lie rode the wildest horses, and shot the biggest stags. "Our Countess loved him far too well, and that was her misfor- tune; and our young Count was exactly like her, and- that was his. Only she was small made and delicate, and had a voice like the clearest bell. When at last, after many long years of waiting, she had hopes of being a mother, she looked like some fair angel, her joy was shining so peacefully in her eyes! , And the Count seemed kinder, and -even stayed here all the summer, to be present at the baby's birth. When the nurse brought it to him, so small and weakly-looking, with its little yellow down upon its head, he said nothing, but put it back into its cradle, and left the room without a word. "I saw that my lady was deeply hurt, and I felt so angry, that I could not keep from saying half to myself, ' Boys don't come into the world on horseback!' But I repented directly, for my lady heard me, and sent me out of the room. A week after this she died. "It was I who had to go and tell my master. He was sitting at the piano, which he played, O, so beautifully! I could have lis- tened to him forever. It was early in the morning: he had watched through the night in my lady's antechamber, and, as she seemed to be rather better, he had just gone up stairs ; only instead of going to bed he sat down to play, and, while he was playing, she died. He shut down the piano, without changing one feature of his face, and went down stairs to look at his dead wife, with the same proud step he always had; arid in the outer room, where our little master lay asleep in his cradle, he passed the poor babe as though it were only a dead image, as its poor mother was. When he came out again, he said to. me: - ,',A wet-nurse must be found; meantime, Flor, I give the child in charge to you. I hold you responsible for every proper care.'   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.          6: "And then he ordered his favorite horse, and rode away, and did not come home till evening. t Three days after this they buried our Countess in the cemetery of the town. The Count went with the funeral on horseback. And I could not help thinking - God forgive me! - there hb goes, prancing away like any conqueror, with his poor victim rried after him for his triumph. Ah When the ceremony was over, and all the servants were as- sembled, eating their funeral feast in silence, and I was alone up stairs, sitting by the little one's cradle, and crying while I was sing- ing him to sleep, in conies my master, stares at the babe awhile, and says: - "' They had to send the nurse away, I hear; the child would not take to her at all?' ' No, sir, he would n't.' "' It will be hard to find another one to suit, in that little hole of a place. Do you think you could undertake to bring up the child yourself by hand, with milk and water, as they do in France? You are a person I can depend upon. I had rather leave the child to you than to twenty wet-nurses.' "I burst out crying, and took my master's hand and kissed it; for, when he pleased, he had a way with him, and a voice, that could turn the heart of his bitterest enemies. ' It is well,' he said, and drew away his hand; I shall be some time away; you will write to me twice a year about the boy, and I shall give orders that no one shall interfere with you.' That same day he left the castle, and for. many a long year we saw no more of him. "I will not weary you, sir, by tell-ing everything, - how my little master grew up to be a great boy, altliough I remember it all as if it were only yesterday; and many's the lonesome hour I spend thinking over the past, from the first tooth lhe cut to the first bird he shot with his little gun. And when I watched him playing in the court with the dogs, or looked after him when he rode out on the bailiff's horse, every muscle as firm and supple as a steel spring, and then that sweet face of his, and that dear little voice, - I used to wonder at his father, who could go wandering about in foreign No. 4.    5  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6538-00000035"/> "         GOOD STORIES. parts, rather than see his child grow up. To be sure, the boy did not take after him at all, except in his love for horses and field sports. For the rest, he was just his mother over again, both in face and temper. And so, when his father came and saw him at ten years old, he frowned, and looked as coldly on him as on a stranger. At night my darling asked me, 'Is papa always so grave-looking, Flor?' and of course I could not tell him how it was. "However, by and by, things began to mend. The Count came every autumn for the shooting-season, and grew quite paternal with our boy; kind or affectionate he never was. I cannot call to mind that he ever kissed him, or even so much as stroked his cheek. "But he gave him, on his thirteenth birthday, a small dun pony, with a bushy mane like a thick clothes-brush, and a pretty saddle; and then Count Ernest was taken to ride out with his papa, away through the forests, for whole days, and often to pay visits in the neighborhood, where the great folks were always pleased to see the boy. Nobody ever dared to say how like his mother he was, for that always vexed the Count. In general the Countess was never spoken of, and the full-length picture of her was hung in a room that was never used; only her son would go into it now and then, and loved it well! He often made me tallk about his mother. But do you know, sir, even then' he had the sense to see that it was wisest not to mention her to his father. He had found out that even death had failed to make her dearer to him. And then he may have seen that it was just the proudest and wildest among the beauties of the neighborhood (and there were several then) who at- tracted his father most. The Count amused himself with them all, and was a very different man to what he was at home. And the boy could not make these doings suit with what he had heard of his mother. "'Poor child!' I thought; 'pray Heaven you may not get a step-mother who may suit your father better! ' "However, that did not seem to be so likely, and by and by it came   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.         -67 to be rumored that the Count never intended to marry again at all. He had his loves in Paris, where he always spent the winter, and would not give them up. Of course Count Ernest never heard a word of this; he was as innocent as any girl could be; and not even that horrid creature, Monsieur Pierre,-who was then the Count's own man, and used to think it a good joke to make an honest woman blush by his loose talk, - even he would affect propriety before the boy. "A sly fox he was, and knew how to accommodate himself to every one. For the rest, he was- a country lad from these parts, and his name was Peter; but after he had been to Paris we never ventured to hint at that. He went everywhere with the Count, and was indispensable to him. He was terribly afraid of him, and worshipped him as a god; but he robbed him always. "And now just fancy, sir! when our young master was about twelve years old, the Count had almost determined on giving him this wretch as a sort of tutor, and asked me what I thought of it. The boy must first learn French, he said, before he began his other studies. I felt as shocked as though he had thought of poisoning the child; and so I took heart and spoke up, and told my master plainly what I thought of Mlonsieur Pierre, and I said I had rather lose my place than stay to see such disgraceful doings. "The Count let me have my say, and was not a bit angry. He only motioned me to go, and never said another word about the matter. But when lie came home in the following September he brought a stranger with him, whom he presented to us as our young master's tutor. We called him Mr. Leclerc, though that was not his real name. He was a nobleman in needy circumstances, who had been glad to find a decent living; otherwise a harmless gentleman enough, who, to the very last day of his life, never could learn one word of German, so that we, all of us, soon picked up enough French to speak it fairly. "He had some little accomplishments, which he used to teach the young Count; such as dancing, fencing, and playing the flute; and then they read some books together; but Master Ernest once told me,  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6538-00000036"/> 68         GOOD STORIES. with a laugh, that before they had read three pages, Monsieur Leclerc would fall asleep, and leave him to read on to himself till the great clock strudk, whell he would wake up with a start, and shake the powder from his sleeve, which he had sprinkled over with it whjie he was nodding, and say, Ehl! bien, c'est a i' and then he would fall asleep again. One thing he used to be very busy with; and that was a knack he had of modelling little figures in pink wax; and lie would paint them and varnish them so prettily that thlley really looked lilke life,-little marquises and viscounts. He had a whole court of them, and would make them dance minu- ets, while a sweet little queen was sitting on a throne, looking on. Afterward I heard from Count Ernest that lie lhad taken into his head that Marie Antoinette had been in love with him. He was as old as that, although he used to go tripping about like any dancing- master. "But here I am, running on, sir, telling you all this nonsense, and you wanting to go to sleep! Yes, when once I begin, I can find no end; and indeed there is not a chair in the castle but could, tell ever so long a story of its own. "Just there, where you are sitting now, sir, I stood one morning, and Master Ernest was sitting here on this very sofa. He had been at a ball for the first time. It had been given at X. by the small officials and chief burghers. He was just sixteen, - and quite grown up, although he was slighter than when you knew him. ' Well, Count Ernest,' I said;, 'and how did you like it? Were there any pretty girls? And whom did you dance with? And who got your posy at the cotillon? ' "Flor,' he said; he always called me Flor, and I was also the only person, until he married, to whom he ever used the ' thou,'- 'Flor, it was all very pleasant; and one there was most pleas- ant- "His eyes were sparkling, and he looked at me in a kind of shy, pretty way I had never seen in him before, -he even blushed a little. c Come, come,' I said', Master Ernest, you make me curious;   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.          69 was it one of the young ladies who had been invited, or one of the townspeople's daughters?' "I'I am not going to betray myself any further, Flor," he said; ' but she was very pretty and very wise, and talked so pleasantly I only wish we were going to have another ball to-night! ' .P Wy ' (Why, that sounds quite alarming, Master Ernest,' I said, and laughed, to stay up all night dancing, and go riding all the morning, and then to want more dancing! Our gracious Count will be quite pleased! And is this really to be your last word, and all your faithful Flor is to be allowed to hear? ' "' My very last word, Flor; it is my own secret, and I mean to keep it.' "' I must get hold of Mr. Leclerc, then,' I said; I he will be able to tell me who you danced with oftenest. 'Try him, Flor,' cried the naughty boy, and laughed. 'All my partners were the same to him,-only "jeunes Allemandes, jolies bourgeoises." He looked after my pas, and never minded where my eyes went; besides, he played ecarte all the evening with the director of the salt-works. Ah! Flor, I never thought there could be such sweet eyes in the world; I used to think that your two welre the sweetest!  "You see, sir, this was what I got for all my pains and my ans- iety! "But this merry mood of his did- not last. Next day he grew quiet and thoughtful, avoided all my questions; and shut himself up in his room at an unusually early hour and then I heard him play- ing, the flute for ever so long after. He could not get this girl out of his head, -I saw that. At first he had felt no more than a pleasant smart, as it were, and could joke about it; but the fever followed. He could not hold out four-and-twenty hours, but he or- dered his horse and rode out alone, returning at night quite cast down. It was plain that he had not seen his flame, and had been too shy to find her out and pay her a visit. Andso he rode to X. several times over, with more or less good luck. One night, when his heart was full, he could not refrain from telling me his adven-  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6538-00000037"/> 70          GOOD STORIES. ture, as I was lighting him up stairs to bed. His face was radiant; but, good Lord! to any other man it would not have been worth the telling; Count Henry would only have said,' Pshaw!' but to him it waa a rare delight. Just at the gates he had met her, out walking with two of her young companions, and all three of them had roses in their hands. Just as he rode by, and bowed, his horse had given a jump, and the young lady had been so startled that she dropped a rose. ' I saw it,' said Master Elrnest, and in a moment I was out of my saddle, and had picked it up and given it her; and she thanked me very kindly, and walked away towards the woods.' "' And you rode on, and the lady did not even give you a rose for your reward? Any other man would have picked up the flower, and stuck it in his button-hole, and galloped off in triumph.' "He looked at me,-and seemed quite struck. 'Flor,' says he, 'I do believe you know more of these things than I, although you are a woman.' "'More likely because I am a woman, Master Ernest,' I said. 'Well, well, I see, the young lady is badly off for mother-wit, or else she can't abide you.' "Of course I was only joking ; for how could I think the girl ex- isted who would not like him? But, for fall that, it made him silent, and I saw that he really thought she did dislike him. "Only once again did he ride over to X., and after that he stayed at home, and was quite down-hearted; he spoke to nobody, but sat in his room writing, - verses, as I believe, - and played the flute, and pined away so, that when Count HHenry came back he was quite angry about his looks, and scolded him, and told him he did not take exercise enough; and he asked me if Count Ernest had been ailing. That he had a heartache I did not like to say, -he never would have forgiven me, and Count Henry would have laughed. At last it was decided that our young Count was to travel for a time with Mr. Leclerc, and both of them seemed to like the plan. 'Flor,' said my boy, 'it is well that I leave this place. Life is become wearisome to me.'   - CO UNT ERNEST'S HOME.'          7i   X "' God bless you, my dearest boy,' I said; 'the world is so beau- tiful, they say, that I suppose one can't long be sad in travelling.' ( He looked at me with an unbelieving smile ; but afterwards he wrote to me from Vienna, that he was well, and often thought of me. God knows I thought of him, day and night! "I did not get a sight of him again for three long years; and when he wrote to me from the great cities where lhe went to court, among all the fine folks, -he will get properly spoiled, I thought, as befits his rank; I shall not know him again. But just the contrary; when he came back at last in his twentietlh year, without Mr. Leclerc, who had died in Russia of the climate, the very first word he spoke, ' Flor,' says he, ' and how is Miss Mimi?' That was a cat I had, sir, of whom he used to be almost jealous, as a child. "Returns thanks for kind inquiries, Master Ernest,' I said: ' she has just kittened and will be delighted, as we all are, to see your honor back again.' "'I am afrtaid it is a delight that won't last long, Flor,' he said; and at night, when I was lighting hiln to bed, as I always did, he told me all about it; how he had done his father's bidding, and been to see the great world,- and he had seen enough of it to find it terribly tedious; and now he had hlad some trouble in carrying his point, which was to go and study alone for a year or two. It was a shame, he said, the confusion that was in his brain. I could only stare at this, for to me he seemed a man in all things, and cleverer, I thought, it was not possible to be, when I heard him talk with others. But he knew best, of course, and I did not con- tradict him then; for there were other things I was more curious to know. I asked him about the life he had been leading, and whether the fine ladies he had been dancing with were handsomer than the daughters of our townspeople. And look you, sir, at this he turned as red as a boy, - he, the accomplished, fine-grown gen- tleman, who had just come from living among the fine folks,- and he only said, ' Some, perhaps, not many'; and so I saw that old love does not always rust. The very next day he rode over to the town; I suppose to make inquiries, and find out whether she were  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6538-00000038"/> 72          GOOD STORIES. still unmarried. Of course I did not know, for I had never heard who she was. When he came back in the evening, he looked very grave. 'It is all over,' I said to myself, ' and all the better that it is so; what could have ever come of it?' "Between him and his father things were no better than they used to be. When I helped to wait at table, I saw that the Count was always ready for a quarrel with his son, who could never stay or do a single thing to please blim. He seemed provoked to be, in a manner, forced to respect the lad, who never by any chance for- got himself, but only quietly defended his own opinion, or held his tongue,-just as the blessed Countess liad always done, and the Count was not fond of being reminded of her. Nothil  would thave pleased him better than to see his son just such another bold bird of prey ascli himself still was, for-all his olflf-century. Never had he found a horse too wild, a woman too witty, or a srord too sharp for him. He could not forgive the boy for being so modest. Indeed I often thought-  God forgive ine!-t1hat he had rather have seen Count Ernest forget his duty to  his ac s fiatlher, if lie only would have forgotten that the Countess was hs mother. Thelrefore the Count always went back to talk of the good od o  times, when the world was merrier-and less particular; now it was only a world for sneaks and lubbers. And when he had drunk a glass beyond the common, hie would tell us all sorts of love-adventures he had had when he was young; while the young   Count would look straight before him, and hold his peace. I was horrified to hear him, and said to myself: ' Can a father really find it in his heart to be the tempter of his son, when he finds his innocence a reproach to him?' "To be sure, I knew that was not the way to tempt my boy at all. He did not even lose the respect he owed him as a father. Only it grieved him sadly never to see the slightest sign that his father loved him; that I saw by liis eyes;- but lie never spoke about it, not even to me, to whom he generally told everything. And so I was almost glad when hle left us in a week to go to col- lege, and never once came home for the next five years, - much as   COU NT EIRNEST'S HOME.         73 he loved his home, and'his woods, and everything about the place, and often as he used to inquire after them in his letters. "'I say, I was almost glad, and was more glad presently. "The young Count may have been away for about three years, when I fell into a bad illness; and that left me a weakness in my limbs, so that-t I could hardly drag myself up and down lthe stairs ; for I kept all the keys, and nobody but Marnsell Flor ever touched a thing in the cellars, store-rooms, or plate-chests. When the Count came home in the autumn, and saw me crawling about the house witlh a stick, ' Flor,' he said, 'you have been doing too much for your y stren gth; you must have some assistance, - a sort of housekeeper under you, to save you going up and down the stairs. So kind he was, you see, sir, in some things; and, for all I could say against it, next day it appeared in the daily papers that a housekeeper was wanted at tl e castle. ' All sorts of women came, but none to please me. One or two among them I even suspected of coveting, a higher place (or a lower, as one takes it) than that of housekeeper; for the Count was known to be a gallant gentleman. I was rather pleased that none of them could be found to suit; I was always too particular, and none of them did things as I liked to have them done. And so we had nearly forgotten that we had wanted one, when, one afternoon, in comes a tall, slight young woman, in deep mourning, with very weary eyes. She had come two days' journey from a town where her father and mother, one after the other, had lately died, and left her entirely unprovided for. Her father had been a functionary of some importance, and had lived -upon his pay. Hel only brother was an engineer, and was now employed in England on a railway, which le could not leave without the sacrifice of all his prospects,. She had therefore written to him not to mind her; she had found a situation in a noble family, and was well provided for, - meaning, if she were not accepted here, to take even a lower place. '"Although everything I could learn about the poor child was entirely satisfactory, and though she passed the severest examina- tion I could think of in household matters, I felt a something in my-  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6538-00000039"/> X *         ur[ Va; ao  1 I/.tl AJ-tO. heart, that warned me not to take her. I told her plainly I thought it might not be for her good. I said she was too young, and what more I could think of. And just as she was going quite submis- sively, without any prayers or tears, I called her back, and kept her after all. In fact I was only afraid she might please the Count too well, for she was as fine a girl as you could see, with a splendid figure, and a high-bred face like nobody else's; and then such a weight of long brown hair, that could reach three times round her head. But I found that she had a grave, decided way with her, and that she was not easily to be put upon. And, besides, Count/ Henry was just then over head and ears in love, as Monsieur Pierre had whispered, with a singer he had met in London, and had only broken from her chains for a short time, to hasten back to them as fast as ever he could. So he did not take much notice of the stranger, when she took-her place at the servants' table for the first time; he just glanced at her from head to foot, gave an approving nod, and sat all the evening alone, at the master's table, playing with his ring, and letting the beautiful green stone glitter at the light; and Monsieur Pierre told us it was a present firom his London friend. And I suppose it was true, for when he came back next year, the ring was gone, and Monsieur Pierre told us strange stories about it, which you will not care to hear, sir. "When the Count first saw the girl again, Mamsell Gabrielle, as she was called, I watched his face attentively as she walked across the hall. He looked much as he used to do, when the dealers brought him horses, and he had them  trotted out into the yard. But he treated her just as he did the rest of us, only that he spoke to her less often. She had begun to bloom again, in the quiet life here among the woods, and with the exercise she took when she was busy about the house. She had left off mourning, and some- times I even heard her singing in the little garden she had laid out with her own hands in the moat, that we might have our vegetables more handy. "In this, as in everything else, she was clever, quiet, and inde. pendent. I may say I got, to love her dearly, and thought we never   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.           75 . . .  should be able to do without her; and yet we had done so long! We used to sit together for many a pleasant hour, spinning and chat- ting. I used to talk to her of my dear Count Ernest, and read his letters to her; and, when Count Henry was at home, we would stand at the window till late at night, listening to his beautiful playing, and to the nightingales singing. Then she would tell me how her childhood had been passed, and of the happy life she had led when her parents were alive, and how well off they had been; and also about her brother; and she spoke of all this without any bitterness, and so I saw that she was quite contented, and that, the longer she lived among us, the more she liked us. ,' And now, for the first time, I was glad when the winter came, 'and we were snowed up again by ourselves. When the Count was here, we had no peace, though he only received gentlemen, and . was particular about those. To be safe from the ladies of the neigh- borhood, he had left all the roads without repair, save only a few bridle-paths. But it did not come at all as I expected. The Count did not leave the castle, and Monsieur Pierre insinuated that it was because he had never been able to forget that faithless love of his, and therefore preferred to live in solitude. I could not get this idea into my stupid old head, for I knew my master too well to believe that he could be so long cast down for such an amour as that., However, stay he did, and the winter came and snowed us up; and, with us, the Count and Monsieur Pierre. "How he managed to get through those long winter days is more than I can tell, for he never had been fond of his book. We could hear him playing on the piano out of his own head for hours togeth- er, and then he used to take long rides into the woods, and it was fine to see him come home, riding in a cloud of smoke from the nos- trils of his snorting horse, his beard all tinkling with icicles, and his grand proud face colored by the frosty air. He had always been a handsome man; and, if his hair was getting a trifle thinner and more gray, his eyes looked all the darker and more fiery. He must have found a sweetheart in this neighborhood, I thought; but we heard nothing; not even in this dull place, where we could hear the leaf i  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6538-00000040"/> 76          GOOD STORIES. fall; market-women and butter-women took care of that. Visits or invitations there were none. I used to shake my head, and Mon- sieur Pierre, who had been used to a gayer life, shook his. He had never dreamed that the Count would hold out so long as Christmas. "'IMamsell Flor,' he said; Iil y :a du mysterie, as sure as my name is Pierre!' and he would whistle. the AMarseillaise and wink; but in fact the rogue knew nothing. To pass the time, he took it into his head to make love to Malmsell Gaibrielle; but he soon let that alone. For, modest as she was, yet she had a way of throwingl back her head at times, you would have thought she was a duchess; and he found out that it was none of his Paris sewing-women he had to deal with. Something French he must have, and so he took to the Bordeaux wine in our cellars, and often he was so drunk that he could not wait at table; but his master never said a word to him. The Count was more gentle than he used to be; he never said an angry word, and at Christmas he made each of us a present. With the new year he took to dining down stairs in the hall, and of an evening he came early, and sat reading the newspapers all alone, at the master's table. But he did not like us to be silent; on the contrary, after supper, he made us stay and sing. The second for- ester had a fine bass voice, and Mamsell Gabrielle could sing like the very wood-witch herself. We often sat up till -past eleven, and it sounded beautifully in the echo of the great hall. Many a time I saw the Count drop the paper, and listen pensively, with his head leaning on his hand. But I always kept thinking of my own dear young Count, and what a weary time he had been away; and I used to talk of him to Mamsell Gabrielle, till she sometimes fell asleep, which made me cross with her. is For the rest, we welre always the best of fiiends, and it was no small shock to me, when one morning she came to tell me that she was obliged to give up her place. She did not think the air was good for her; she meant to try another. Well, she had slept very badly, I knew, the night before. She still looked feverish, and her eyes were red; and as often as I called to her she would begin trembling all over. She might have caught cold, for she had come   ,.,-----.  -.-*. . ......'\ 24:W - ==w5; ri- -TZ7 ; F; COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.           77: .^.. --. home late from a walk in the woods the day before, and had gone straight to bed, without coming down to supper. 'Child,' I said, 'it will pass off. The- air of this place is healthy; and where will you find so easy a situation, and so kind a master?--not to speak of my own humble self.' But, the more I talked, the more positive she grew, and I thought I should only make her worse; so I went up stairs to my master, to tell him that Mamsell Gabrielle had just given warning. "The Count heard me out, and then he said: 'Do you know any reason for her going, Flor?' When I began about her health,-- ' What room have you given her?' 'I took her into mine, sir,' I said. ' Your honor knows the rooms on the first story, just opposite my lady's bedroom; I have slept in them for twenty years and more, and I never found anything unwholesome for one moment.' "He considered awhile, and said: 'If Mamsell Gabrielle chooses to go, of course we can't prevent her, Flor; she is her own mistress. But at least she shall not say that she lost her health in my service. Your rooms look to the forest, and the west winds come blowing against the windows. It must be damp; and in win- ter there is not a finger's breadth of sunshine. While Mamsell Gabrielle remains, you will have to give her another room. Put her in those opposite, that look into the court; they have the morning sun full upon them; and then you may advertise for another situa- tion, for her.' "I stared at him. 'I am  to put Mamsell Gabrielle in the apartments where our gracious Countess slept?' "He nodded. ' I will have it so,' he said shortly. "' But all the furniture is just as it was then,' I'went on, with- out minding his frown. 'How can I give my blessed mistress's things-her bed and table, and her toilet service--to a stran- ger?.' "'You can do as I bid you,' he said, very quietly. 'Leave everything as it stands.' "'And if the poor thing gets worse,' -and I spoke more eager- ly,- 'whom has she at hand to look after her?'  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6538-00000041"/> 78          GOOD STORIES. "' There is only the passage between you,' hle answered. 'If Mamsell Gabrielle should be unwell, it will be very easy for you to nurse her.' "He sdt down to the piano, and began to play, and so I was obliged to go. And I must say, fond as I was of Mamsell Gabri. elle, it cut me to the- heart to have to go down stairs, and air those --beautiful apartments, to 'put a servant in them. For that she was, the same as I was. And, moreover, I did not like her face, when I told her what the Count had been pleased to order. She first turned white, as if she had been frightened, and then she grew scar. let; she curled her lip half scornfully, and said: 'Very well;'God will not forget me, wherever you may please to put me!' She took over her little bed with her, and would not put her bits of clothes in those beautiful inlaid drawers, but left them packed in her little trunk, all ready to go. And I liked that of her; and I kissed her, and begged her pardon in my heart for having so grudged her my lady's rooms. She sobbed awhile on my shoulder, and I had some little trouble in soothing her, but I laid it all upon the fever. That night I left my door ajar, to hear if she went quietly to sleep; and all was quiet till about twelve o'clock. Then, all of a sudden, I thought I heard her talking loud and angrily. I jumped out of bed, and, all the time I was feeling for my slippers, I heard her talking on. I could not catch the words till I got into 'the passage, and then I distinctly heard her say: 'I am only a poor servant-girl; but may the walls of this castle fall upon me and crush me, rather than ... .' "I knocked at the door (which she had bolted by my advice), and screamed out: ' Gabrielle, child! What is the matter? An- swer me, for the love of God! Whom are you talking to? Is the room haunted?' No answer.  I looked through the keyhole,-- nothing to be seen. I went on knocking and calling, but it was a long time before I could get a wiselike answer. 'Mamsell Flor? is that you? what makes you come so late?'-- and presently I heard her unbolting the door. "-She stood before me in the darkness; only the snow gave a faint    COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.          -79  light from the windows. I took her hand, and felt it trembling and ice-cold. 'What makes you come to me so late, Mamsell Flor?' she said. 'Have I been talking in my sleep? O yes, I am ill; I think I am in a fever; just feel how my limbs are shaking!' And with that she burst out crying. I got her to bed again as fast as ever I could, and sat up all night with her. "In the morning she was too ill to rise, and did not get well again for more than a week. The Count did not seem much con- cerned about it, though he sent Monsieur Pierre to inquire after her. "The first time she came down stairs to supper, my master went up to her, and said a few words in a low voice, and then she walked silently and thoughtfully to her seat. And silent and thoughtful she remained, for the matter of that. But she slept quietly of nights, . and did her work, as usual, like a pattern. She asked me now and then whether any answer had been made to our advertisement. Our letters all went through Monsieur Pierre's hands, and he had heard of none. But she seemed in no hurry to go, and I was only too glad to have her stay. a Spring came, and we were still without my dear young Count. Instead of him there arrived one day a very disagreeable stranger, a gentleman from London; and indeed I don't think that even my master was quite glad to see him. But he did his best to receive him civilly, as was due to an old acquaintance. He rode with him all over the country, and he invited people to play cards with him. They would sit up gambling till daybreak, trying all the wines in the cellar, and never once coming down to the hall. "This went on for about a fortnight, and glad enough I was when I heard that the English Lord wads going away next morning. The last day they had been to dine at the Baron's, eight miles off. It might be about nine o'clock when we heard their horses come pat- tering over the bridge. We were just at supper, and I was getting up to take a candle and light the gentleman up stairs; but before we could leave the table they came in,--the English gentleman foremost, with that look he had in his eyes when he had just dined. And the Count came after him with his riding-whip under his arm,  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6538-00000042"/> oV          L    I rUJ ZIAIJ O. and his spurs jingling with that heavy tread by, wich I knew that his spirit was up. "We all rise, and mlake our bows and courtesies; the English Lord, keeping his hat upon llis head, gives us a sort of coldescending no1d, and says: ' Devil take long rides, Harry! I feel as stiff as a poker! Don't let us go up stairs to-night; let us have our grog down here by the chimney-corner. I incline to affability towards these your trusty vassals!'- and lie stared from one of' us to the other, and never listened to what the Count was saying to him in French, in a low voice. All at once he catches sigh-t of Mamsell Gabrielle, and chuckles quite out loud. ' Ha! Harry, old boy!' he cries; 'what. an old fox you are! do you keep such doves as these in your hen- house? Foi de gentilhomme! '- and. he laughed so insolently that I felt the blood rush into my face. 'Let us have this dove at supper, I say, with a good glass of Burgundy: you have plucked it long ago, of course -' and then another great roar of laughter. My very heart stood still - I looked at the poor girl - she was as white as the wall - and my master looked - sir, I cannot tell you 'how he looked. He went close up to- the Englishman, where he stood laughing, and said out loud: 'You will ask the young lady's pardon, sir, this moment, - and then you will leave the room. I can protect my people from the insolence of any man, be he who he may!' "The Lord did not seem to hear him, and kept staring at the girl. 'By Jove!' he said, speaking thick with drink; 'deuced neat built she is! and I have been in the house a week and more, and never yet -  Ah! Harry, I say, d-d sly old fox is Harry. Come, dear, don't let me frighten you.' And he stretched out his arm to take her round the waist, while the poor thing stood mo- tionless against the wall, as if she had .been struck by lightning, - when we heard a sharp sound whistling through the air, and, with a great oath, the Lord drew back his hand. The Count had drawn a broad red stripe across it with his riding-whip. "Sir, I need not tell you all that passed that night; only that by seven o'clock next morning my master had fought the stranger,    without seconds, at a place they call the Wolfs Gap. We heard the crack of the four shots in the still February morning, and, half an hour afterwards, the Count came home bleeding from his left hand. He did not send foi' a surgeon, but had it bound up by his valet, Monsieur Pierre, who had been with him on the ground, and told us that the Lord had not come off so easily; but he had been able to get on horseback, and ride on to the next town. "What that poor thing, Gabrielle, said to it all? Good Lord! she held her peace, as if she had really been turned to stone that evening; and, what surprised me rather, she never thought of go- ing to thankl her master for what he had done; but she never talked of leaving now. "From that morningy when we heard the shots, she was so changed I should scarcely have known her. She went through her work as usual, and was, neither glad nor sad, only absent, - so absent, that of an evening she would sit for hours, staring into the lig!lt as if she were in a trance,-and I must say these strange  ways became her; shec grew handsomer from day to day. We ev-  ery one of us noticed it. As to the younger functionaries about the place, there was not a single man of them who was not over head and ears in love with her. But she never seemed to see it, - and not one of them had a kinder word to boast- of than the others. "Summer came, and brought no change. The Count was still at the castle; Monsieur Pierre sitting with his bottle before him half the day; and everybody wondering and conjecturing what was likely to come of this new style of living. The busy tongues had a fresh match ready every week for my master. For he had got to be far gayer; he willingly accepted invitations in the neighborhood, and even gave little fates in return, where he was all politeness. I had never known him to be in such a humor before, and I thanked God for it; the more, as we expected our young Count to come home in the autumn, and it would have broken my heart if they had not met in peace and kindness. "And O sir! that night, when my Count Ernest came, and his father rode out to meet him, (he came from Berlin, after having No. 4.     6  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6538-00000043"/> 82          GOOD STORIES. passed his examination most brilliantly,) I felt-his own mother could not have felt more. And when I saw him, so t all and hand. some, riding beside his father through the triumphal arch of fir-trees the men had put up for hiln across the bridge, and the lovely transparency over the gate, with the word ( Welcome!' and Monsieur Pierre's rockets whizzing right up into the sky, I burst into tears,  and could not speak a word. I only took his hand, and kept kiss- ing it again and again. "And he was just the same as ever; and he stroked my face, and had his old jokes with me, that were only between us two. Ahl! sir, that was a pleasant meeting! The Count-- I mean the father --walked up stairs with his son, looking quite pleased and proud; and indeed it was a son to be proud of. I felt so cross with Miam- sell Gabrielle, when I asked her what she thought of our young Count, and found she could not tell me whether he were dark or fair. But when I came to consider of it, I said to myself that, after all, this was better than falling in love with him,--for that was what I had always been afraid of. Poor short-siglhted creatures that we are! "In the evening I was called up stairs to help to wait upon the gentlemen, who had their supper in Count Henry's room. Mon- sieur Pierre's fireworks had so heated him, that he was not to be got out of the cool cellars that night at all; and I was only too happy to take his place, and have a good look at my young Count. But my pleasure was soon spoiled, for the Count his feather soon began to talk again, as he used to do, of the good old times. ' The young folks of the present day,' he said, ' are fit for nothing but to sit by the chimney-corner, with their noses on their books; worse still, to write themselves, even for the daily papers.' I don't re- member all he said,-only some things that appeared to me the worst, -some things I shall not forget to my dying day. "You must know, sir, that when Count Henry had been a half- grown lad, he had been taken to Paris by his father, just when the Empire was at its height; and as the old Count (grandfather to our Count Ernest) had always been of those to whom Napoleon was as -    !        COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.           83 - a god, of course they met with the best reception, The old Count had been at Paris before, for, some years during the Revolution; and most of those bad, bloody men had been his friends; and Count Henry began to talk of these. ' Do you suppose,' he said, 'that the Emperor could have fought these battles with our good bourgeois of the present day? Wild beasts those were he had to tame, and to let loose upon his enemies. There was a scent of blood in the very air of Paris then, that was withering to the sicklier plants, and turned the weatker spirits faint. But, to a resolute man, the sul- phureous atmosphere proved intoxicating. He would have dared a thousand devils. And as the men, so the women; all had tasted blood, -and blood makes brilghter eyes than household dust. Just look at our present world,' he said, - -our German world at least, --compared to that! all so prim, precise, and regular, like the straight lines of a Dutch garden. - Fathers, schoolmasters, and wise professors are there to trim it, and, if anything escapes them, there is the police. If ever the brute begins to show itself in man,-in civilized man, - quick comes the police with a summons to expel it; but the beast is not to be expelled,--it must have blood,- if not in pailfuls, at least in drops; it will turn sneakingly domestic, and suck it from the veins of its nearest neighbor. Out upon the- small sly social vices of the day! they are so shabby! worse,- they are so stupid! See what they:will do for this puny genera- tion when a time for action comes, -for great deeds to be done by thorough men, and genuine mettle. When a man says he shrinks from shedding blood, and would not crush a worm, I say it is his own blood he is so chary of, and shrinks from shedding. At that time, Death was the Parisian's familiar,--his bosom friend; to- \ gether they fought and won the Emperor's great victories.' And then my master went on to talk of a ball, where his father had been; they called it ' le bal des Zephyrs,' because it was given on a spot which had been a churchyard, -I forget the name of the church. And just above the skull and cross-bones upon the gate- way, they had put up a transparency with the inscription, ' Le bal des Zephyrs'; and they had danced like mad upon the graves and tombstones, till morning.  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6538-00000044"/> "All this time my dear young Count sat grave and silent, oppo. site his father, whose discourse, I could plainly see, appeared as blasphemous to him as it did to me; but he spoke very calmly, and beautiful were the things he said. 'Man has progressed since then,' he said; ' it requires more energy to build up than to destroy.' In his opinion, 'a world without a sense of veneration must neces- sarily decay and fall in pieces, like a building without cement'; and more of the like which I have forgotten, more's the pity; but when he spoke, I used rather to watch his eyes than mind his lips! His eyes would grow so clear, you could look right through them. Only one thing more I recollect; he said: 'A generation that can dance on the graves of its fathers will assuredly care little for its chil. dren; a man who tramples upon the past is unworthy of a fu- ture -- ' "As these words escaped him, he turned red and stopped short, fearful lest his father should be offended by them. But, bless you, he was not used to mind such trifles! "'Bah!' says he: 'we are all the same, only we are quieter; we do the same things, only not to the sound of' fifes and trumpets. -we have no piping to our dancing. In every generation man is selfish, and has a right to be. There was another kind of ball in those days, they called it "le bal des victimes." When the Conven- tion had confiscated the property of the guillotined, it was returned to their heirs, after the 9th Thermidor. Thus many of them held their lands par la grace de Robespierre. Young men began to live fast again, and to enjoy themselves. They gave balls where only those were admitted who could prove that some very near re- lation had been beheaded; it was a sort of herald's office to the scaffold; and to show their gratitude for their inheritance, they e invented a peculiar mode of salutation. A gentleman would go d up to a lady, and jerk his head forwards, as if he dropped it, and the lady would -do the same. They called it "Salut a la victime "'; and all this with fiddling and dancing, and wax-lights, and cham- 1 pagne. I do not admire that style of thing myself; it was a fashion like any other, and not a  pretty one, I think; but I a    really do see no improvement in young people's babbling of the sanctity of family ties, and of their duty to their fathers and fore- fathers, and sighing in secret for their turn to come, even if without I the connivance of a Robespierre.' "I left the room, for I could not hear him speak in such a way to such a son. I waited in the antechamber till Count Ernest came out to go to bed. He was sad and silent, and would have passed without noticing me, but I took up my light, and followed him. In the passage he suddenly stopped and looked eagerly up the staircase, that was well lighted with a two-branched lamp. 'What now?' thinks I; and then I saw Mamsell Gabrielle coming down from the loft with some plate she had been to fetch, and pass us on her way down stairs. When she had quite disappeared; ' Who is that, Flor?' says he, quickly turning to me, -' who is that lady?' ' ("When I told him, he shook his head. ' Can it be the same?' he murmured, 'or can I be so far mistaken?' And then after a while, when I had come into his room with him, 'Flor,' he said, 'I am right; she was only on a visit to X. when she was at that ball, and she left it again soon after. Both parents, did you say?-and so poor, so friendless, that she was forced to go to service?' "'She wants for'nothing here,' I said, to pacify him; for then I saw at once that she was that old flame of his, for whom he had pined so long. ' My dear young master,' I said,'she could never be better off than she is here. His honor is very kind to her, and will have her treated with the greatest consideration and respect.' "But he did not seem to hear me; he was sitting there in that great arm-chair by the open window, thinking, and thinking, till he made me feel quite nervous. He appeared to be so troubled in his mind, as all the past came over him, and all that he thought he had forgotten.                     , "The old rooms again; the tapestry with the huntinc-scenes;    I the furniture he had seen from his childhood; the dark woods before the windows, and then his father's horrid talk, -if he forgot his  X !"-,- - -- -- . '.':  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6538-00000045"/> poor old Flor awhile, I am sure I could not wonder. I was about to steal quietly away and leave the room, when he saw me, and, rising, he came and laid his two hands upon my shoulders. "'Flor,' he said, 'if it should really come to pass,--which is more than I dare to hope,--what a wonderful, delightful dis- pensation it would be!' (' If what should come to pass?' says I; for, fond as I was of' the girl, the idea that she could ever become our gracious Countess was a thing I never could have dreamed of. 'Let us leave it all to Providence, Flor,' he said, very seriously. ' Good night, Flor.' "And with that he went to the window again, and I to my lonely room, where, for all it was so quiet, I could not fall asleep for hours. "And so, next morning I overslept myself, and was quite ashamed when I saw the bright sun shining in at my window. My room, just looked over the vegetable beds that Mamsell Gabrielle had laid out; and I saw her busy among them, cutting what was needed for the table. I was just going to call to her, and tell her how long I had been sleeping, when I saw Count Ernest coming out of the wood, and going towards the little garden. He bowed to her, and I saw how she stood up, and returned his bow with due respect, but quite naturally,--not an idea of recognition,-- not even when he spoke to her; nothing of the awkwardness of recollecting that her former partner now stood before her as her master. He appeared more embarrassed than she was. And as they crossed the garden,' side by side, I could not help thinking to myself, if God should so appoint it, a handsomer pair could not be found in all the world. I was quite willing that the poor child should have all that happiness and honor, if she only made my boy as happy as he deserved to be. "But you know, sir, 'rman proposes, and God disposes,' as the proverb says, and I soon found out. "I had not looked after them long, when Monsieur Pierre came running to tell Count Ernest that his fahther was wanting him imme- diately; and soon after they rode away together; and indeed, sir, it was quite a sight to see that handsome father on his wild black horse, and the slender son riding a light brown Arab mare, as they '   ( galloped over the bridge into the wood. Monsieur Pierre said they had been invited to the Baron's: there they had cast their hooks in haste for the son, when they found the father could not be made to bite; and indeed the three baronesses had not much time to lose; but 'they reckon without the host,' thinks I. "As for Mamsell Gabrielle, I could not get much out of her. Many years ago she had been in X., on, a visit to a friend, and there she had danced with our young master. It was plain that he had been so bashful, that she had no idea of the impression she had made; she talked of him as of any other young man. This made me reloss, I must confess; but to be sure, it was all quite right, and far better so; and I resolved to have no hand whatever in the business,  and neither by word or hint to meddle with it, but to leave it en- tirely to Providence. "When the gentlemen came back that night, I had a good long talk with my young Count at last. He was very merry. He de-    : scribed the foolish dressed-up ways of these three lemon-colored baronesses, who in those, last five years had grown so young and  ] bashful, so girlish and so giggling; and had pouted so prettily at 3% his father for being so bad a neighbor, hinting at their hopes that : the son might make amends; and so, with one eye upon the father,  and the other upon the son, altogether the attraction had been  rather louche.                            "'Ahl!. Flor,' he said, 'it was just the thing to make me sick of 1 the so-called proper matches. I half suspect my father to have - taken me there on purpose to warn me from the daughters of the country, and make me feel the value of my liberty; he knows how I hate the thoughts of going to Stockholm, where they want to send me, with the Legation. I had so much rather stay at home among my woods, and only be a sportsman, or a farmer. And you, Flor, you  ! faithful soul, you would never bid me go. But when I just hinted at my wishes, treating them as a sort of romantic whim, I saw at once that by staying I should lose the last remnant of my father's good opinion; and indeed I have no occasion,' he said, with-a faltering in his voice, that made my heart ache terribly, -'I have ,  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6538-00000046"/> 88          GOOD STORIES. no occasion to put his affection to too hard a test. After all, Flor, one has but one father, in this world.' "Poor boy, it was the first time he ever showed how much it grieved him to be so little loved. "' My darling Count Ernest,' I said; ' you know how I wish you all your heart desires; but to live here in this solitude, at your age, one had needs be wonderfully happy, or desperately wretched.' "' And which was your case, Flor? ' he asked. "c I was happy,' I said; ' for I had a dear little master to bring up, who never for a moment let me feel that I was not his own mother, but only a penniless servant-girl.' "He took my hand, and said: 'Rig(ht, you dear old woman! but if, to live here, one must needs have everything one wishes, or noth- ing, why should I despair of having everything?' "I held my tongue, for I did not dare to begin first to speak of what he might be thllilinking needful to his happiness. He guessed what I was thinking of; for he said:-- "' To be sure, even if the greatest of all gifts were within my reach, who knows whether r should be allowed to take it? Curious, how men contradict themselves! There is my father now, who never goes to court, because, he says, the nobility of to-day lias nothing thorough-bred about it, if it be not in the stables. Yet how would he look, if I were to go and propose giving him a daughter who was only a blameless gill, who had been his servant? But I am talking nonsense. It is not likely that I shall be tempted to make such a proposal.' (' The safest way not to be tempted is to go abroad,' I said, at last, as he sat silent and discouraged. ' For, my dear Count Ernest, if IMamsell Gabrielle appears to have no eyes for her young mas- ter, I am certain it is only because she is a servant-girl, and knows what -she is about. It would be a thousand pities for the poor child, if she were to suffer her heart to escape her through her eyes, for there would be no recalling it. I know her well: she has a ,brave spirit of her own. If she were to say, "'I will do this, if I were to die for it," she would do it, and die, without a word.'   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.           89 "God knows, I found it hard to say all this to my darling boy, and, moreover, presently I found that I had only been making mat- ters worse. "He had never hoped that the girl could love him, but now he interpreted her reserve more favorably; he thought it might be forced, in self-defence, to enable her to stand more firm; and that perhaps she suffered from it no less than he did. And indeed I thought the same. I, too, thought her changed since Count Er- nest had been at home. She had grown graver and more absent. I often saw her sweet face change from white to red, without any suf- ficient cause. I meant to speak to my young Count at the very first opportunity, and entreat him to come to some decision; to set- tle it one way or the other. But the opportunity did not come of itself, and I wanted heart to seek one. I loved him dearly, and it was hard for me to part with him so soon. "And so a. week passed, and then a fortnight, and three whole weeks, and the evil was growing daily before my eyes; and other eyes saw it too ; at least I heard, from Monsieur Pierre, that the two Counts had been talking of Stockholm again. Count Henry had in- sisted on Count Ernest's going at once, and Count Ernest had begged for time to think about it. After that- the father had taken care that they should be out all day, so that his son should find no time for the handsome Mamsell Gabrielle. ' C'est dr61e,' says Monsieur  Pierre, the cunning creature; ' if my master were in love with the girl himself, he Could not be more careful of her; but I would lay my life that he has not the shadow of a liaison with her. It would be the first time he ever undertook such a thing without my help; and how could he? - in this castle all over ears and eyes! No, I rather think there must be something deeper in it. The girl's mother, perhaps, you understand me. But this is strictly between us two, Miamsell Flor.' All this was puzzling, but the end was very different to anything my stupid head had thought of. "One evening in October, - by some chance or other, there had been no riding out that day,- Count Henry was busy with the steward's accounts, and Count Ernest had gone out with his gun  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6538-00000047"/> and his melancholy to the woods. I heard a strancge voice in the B court speaking to one of the men, and inquiring for Mamsell Ga- brielle. She Ihad just gone to the garden, to cut some dahas and china-asters for the supper-table. So down I go to ask the stranger what he wants with her, and feel quite pleased to hear it is her brother come from England all the way to see her. He had a seri- ous, steady, manly way with him, that I rather liked, though his dress and manner were far below his sistelr's; indeed his dress was almost shabby. I gave him a hearty wrelcome, and told him how glad the dear girl would be to see him, and led him throuclh the lit- lle postern-ate, that opens to the moat and to the garden; and thelre, standing among the tall flowers, we saw oulr Gabrielle. She, knew him in An instant, but I thought, for a brother and sister whvllo Sad not met for years, they-were not so very eager about it.  "Sle turned pale, as though she were going to faint, and he held *ut his hand, saying a few words in a tone as if he pitied her. ' It s the first time they are together since they have been orphans,' hinks I; ' I must go and leave them by themselves.' And so I went ack to my own room; and wlen I looked out of the window I still aw them standing as I had left them I He was saying something  ut nothing pleasant, it appeared, earnestly, in a low voice, while he only hung her head and listened.  "In about ten minutes' time, Count Elnest came out of the wood, nd saw the two as they stood together. He went strairhit up to ie stranger, and bowed to him politely, and I saw that he joined in leir conversation. I could not hear what they said, they spoke so ietly. But at last the young Count raised his voice: ' ou will- link better of it perhaps. How is it possible to decide so hastily? Vhat does your sister say? what do you think of it, yourself, Ga- rielle? Your sister is quite startled, You see, by this sudden break the tenor of her life. Not even your brotherly affection for her  lould induce you to adopt any violent measures. Your sister is so ghly valued by us; she is so necessary to us all! I am sure e has no reason to wish for any change. If you will remain with a few days as our guest, you will convince yourself, T hope, that e may be very tolerable in this wilderness of ours.'    He held out his hand to the stranger, who was, I thought, rather slow to trike it, and turned away, and, after saying a word or two I could not catch, walked towards the castle. "Coulnt Erllnest remained standingp beside Gabrielle, saying noth- ilig at first, but only looking earnestly in her face, while she looked down. Then he began to speak fast and low, and in my heart I felt every word he said, though I heard nothing; upon which she suddenly dropped her flowers, and, covering her face with her two hands, she ran away and left him, and I could see that she was cry- ing bitterly. 'I-He stood looking after her till she disappeared among the- woods. He did not venture to follow her, but I saw that his face hIad that happy, thoughtful look he used to have long ago, when, after the long winter, he would stand watching the sun rise above the woods for the first time, and feel that the sweet spring season was at hand. - "My heart melted, and I folded my hands, and prayed; I hardly  know what I was praying for, till I heard the strangrer's voice in the passage, asking Monsieur Pierre if he could be admitted to speak  to Count Henry, and there he stayed a long time. I heard them walking up and down in the room above me, talking loud and an-  grily. When the stranger was gone, and Count Henry had gone out, Monsieur Pierre came and told me what he had heard in the  ante-chamber. ' And then, sir, I heard that the stranger had come all this way from England only to take his sister from us. And do you know what made him come? That duel with the English Lord was at the bottom of it all. It had appeared in the papers, and had been the talk in London for a day or'two, and many of my master's old adventures and love affairs had been raked up again; so this broth- er had had no peace for thinking of it, and at last he had started off, travelling day and night, meaning to fetch his sister away at once, and take her with him just as she stood, without stopping one mo-  ment longer.  "M'Mon cher,' had my master said; 'let me tell you that you are acting like a fool, to your own damage. I need not trouble myself    &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6538-00000048"/> 9 2-         GOOD STORIES.          - to discuss with you which is likely to prove more injurious to your sister, - my cllastisincg a man who had insulted her, or your coming here to fetch her away, at a moment's notice, from a home where she is perfectly secure in the respect of all who know her, to take lier to a strange place where there are numbers of such lords, who are not often likely to be so kind as to let you shoot them; but, as I said before, that is your own affair. Mine is, to see that your sister's liberty be respected, for she is of age; further, that the legal term of warning be observed. I am not prepared to dismiss my servants at a day's notice, just as they may think fit.' "The young man had found a thousand reasons to oppose to this, speaking in an abrupt business-like way, and suffering himself to be so far carried away as at last to offer a sum of money for the rupture of the contract. And then my master had turned his back upon him and gone out, leaving the bold man standing, who, after some consideration, had hurried away, and left the castle for the next town; probably to consult the burgomaster as to the lengths the law would let him go, in his attempts to force the Count to give up hins sister. "With all these things buzzing in my head, I felt crosser than ever with Monsieur Pierre, and had no ears for his stale jokes. I wanted to ask Gabrielle herself what she iwished to doa; for, after all, that was the chief thing to be considered. So I went over to her room, to wait till she came back. It was all just as it used to be,--the gilding on the mirrors and picture-frarnes, and on the furniture; and the beautiful hangings of green damask with a large raised pat- tern on it. And there was her plain servant's bed under the silk curtains, and her trunk with her bits of clothes. I began to think how it would be if we had a young mistress living there; and while I was pondering, and looking at the picture of Count Henry over the sofa, painted when he was going to be married (I will show it you to-morrow, sir), and seeing some dust upon the consoles, I took the corner of my apron and was going to wipe to ipe them, when I heard a noise like mice behnd the hangings , and stood still to hear where it was coming from. Well, there is a great mirror in a broad old-   [     COUNT  ERNEST'S-HOME.         9-a fashioned frame, reaching down to the ground (the fellow of it is up stairs in Count Henry's room) ; behind this I heard a rustling and a creaking, and I was looking about to find the hole, when all of a sudden the floor begins to slide, as it were; I see my face in the glass going round, as if I were giddy, the wall opens in the gap- ing frame, and who should step out of it but my own Count Ernest! "If I was dreadfully startled, he was no less astonished. 'Why Flor!' he cried, 'good evening to you! Are you surprised? Here I come upon you like a thief in the night, in an odd way enough. I had no conception of such a thing. I wanted to speak to my father, and, not finding him in his room, I waited for him. I was determined to tell him all, and not to pass another night in a state of such uncertainty. To her I had spoken. Her brother wants to take her away, and I asked her whether she would find it so easy to go away and leave us, and if she thought she could be induced to stay for my sake. Upon which she burst into tears and ran away. But I -rather hope you were right, Flor, and that there really may be nothing to part us but the coat-of-arms above the gateway. As for that, we might do without it, and quietly settle in a happier home. Just as I was thinking over what I would say to my father, my eye fell by chance on a part of the mirror where the frame appeared to have been damaged. I put my finger upon it mechanically, and was poking at it, when all at once the glass gave way, and then I saw a great gap staring me in the face. I had scarcely stepped through to see what was beyond it, when it closed upon me again and left me in the dark; and, find- ing neither spring nor handle to open it again, there was nothing for it but to grope my way straight on along a small passage, and then down a small winding staircase all pitch dark, and then I came to a dead halt against a wall. I must own that I had some slight shudderings and misgivings while I was feeling about for the spring, till I got hold of it. Deuce take these dungeons, Flor!' he cried, quite amused: ' are there many of these moleworks in this place? Whither have they led me? Where am I now, Flor? Surely, ... this is not your room, Flor? is it-was it not--my  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6538-00000049"/> U               NJ' A f f1.i-. mother's? and now, now,- does not - yes - does not Gabrielle -.. sleep -' "He broke off short, and looked at me; and, oh! such a look of horror flared up in his frightened eyes. And then he closed them, as though he could not bear to look again on any human being. I myself felt more dead than alive, but I made an effort to speak, - to say something. "' It was for her health,' I said; ' only because the sun is on this room, that my master desired me to give it to Gabrielle. My dear boy,  my darling,--what is it you are thinking of? What is there in this to trouble you so terribly.? That passage,-you see, nobody ever knew of it, -not even your father, probably. It is true, the mechanism has not rusted,- the springs slip smoothly into their grooves, but that is no reason - my dear Count Ernest-- you cannot think - how should damp or dust get at it, where we take such care? It is a curious coincidence, - a chance'; I said, and tried to feel convinced; ' how could it be anything else? and she such a modest gill, and so particular about her honor; and but a few months ago, my master' -and then I was fool enough- only think of the stupidity, sir-to go and rake up that story of the duel, and in my fright I thought I was doing wonders to make him easy, and myself. But even whilst I was talking, the scales were dropping from my eyes; I saw how it was, - who ever does fight a duel for a servant, after all? When I thought of this, I came stammering, and could find nothing wiser to go on with than, 'It would be beyond belief,- it must be a mistake, --or else I could never trust one human creature on earth again, - scarcely the Lord in Heaven.' '"He looked up at his father's picture on the wall, and then at her little trunk, and I saw that -he did not believe in a mistake. I had taken hold of his hand in my agitation, and I felt that it was quite numb and cold; I don't believe there was a pulse in it. 'Flor,' he said, in a low voice; 'you will never tell how it chanced; you will tell no living soul; promise me, Flor.' "I pressed his hand between both mine. I could not speak, for O                - '   L v LU .zV J zlv z 'lw",'7 l'o/1E.  095, I felt as if ten millstones had fallen on my heart. He gently drew away his hand, and left the room. Where he went, I never could find out. Nobody knew where the others were that evening. Count Henry did not come down to suppers, lamsell Gabrielle's brother did not return, and she herself was walkingo in the woods long after dark. "As soon as my trembling legs would carry me, I Went over to my own room; I wanted to hear or to see nothing of nobody, - least of all, of Maamsell Gabrielle. That evening I hated her with all my heart and soul. "'If the earth would only open and swallow her up!' I thought to myself a hundred times. 'If the woods would only fall upon her and crush her, before she should come between father and son, i to estrange them still more than they already are!' I upbraided  ' amyself bitterly for having been melted by her pale face and her  i mourning, and taken her into the house, although I had felt asecret warning at the time; and then I thought of my own Count Ernest,   i how he was wandering all night about the woods, half mad with   i grief, looking on his boyhood's brightest dream-on the only    I thing he had ever set his heart on-as some unnatural sin; per-   : haps--who knows?-   as an offence to all he held most sacred. 'What will be the end of it all?' I lamented to myself, as I wrung my hands; and I felt as if the coming morning were to dawn  - on the day of judgment!                       ' "When I heard the girl go past my door at bedtime, I shook all over with my hate and horror: of her. If she had happened to  come in, I really do not know what I should have done to her. If  i my boy had been poisoned by her, I don't think I could have hated her more.  I could not conce ive how I had been so blind.     7 "Not to call myself a fool, I called her all the names I knew. I abused her for the most horrid hypocrite, the slyest creature that ever ensnared a  man, or deceived a woman. I tied a great silk handkerchief over my head, that I might not hear her- in her room,  or be ah unwilling witness if anybody came to her in the night. "If anybody did, I  did not know it. I had lighted my lamp   I -n  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6538-00000050"/> and taken out my hymn-book; but, Godsforgive me, I did not know what I was reading. And I was hungry too, for I had not gone down to supper, and that made me feel still crosser with the girl. "As for my master, I never thoughllt of blaminlgw allything he did. I had broken myself of that, years ago. At last I fell asleep with grief and hunger, - at least, I suppose I did, for I was waked up suddenly by feeling a hand laid upon my shoulder. I could not hear, because I had my head tied up. "The lamp had quite burned down, and the first gray of the morning light might be seen from the window. And,beside my chair I saw Mamsell Gabrielle standing. I stared at hler, for she had her little straw bonnet on, and her brown shawl pinned across her chest, and her parasol in her hand. I really had some trouble to collect my thouglhts and remember what had happened. Mean- while that sad gentle face of hers had had time to melt the cruel crust of hate that had gathered about my heart. I untied my handkerchief and got up. 'Good heavens! what have you come here for? is it so late? have I been asleep? ' "' My dear IMamsell Ilot;' she said, 'it is hardly four o'clock; I am very sorry to disturb you, but I have something to say to you, and I must say it. You were always so kind to me, it would hurt me to have you think ill of me when I am gone, if you did not know my reasons for the step I am about to take.' "' What step?' I cried; ' what are you going to do? You are ready dressed for a journey; you don't mean to go and leave the house in this way, in the dark and cold? Your brother has not come back to fetch you.' "' I am going to him,' she said; 'I am goinDg to beg him to take me away with him,--to the very end of the world, rather than leave me here. O, that I had only had the courage to do so sooner!  Miserable I might have been, for I should have left my heart behind me, but I should not have been sinful; and I could have looked you bravely in the face and said good by to you, my dear kind friend, who have been a mother to me.

Dear Mamsell Flor, only yesterday he told me that he loved me, and I .... for many months I have been his father's -' "She stopped, as if in horror at the sound of her own words; and I who but yesterday had been so full of rage and- hate, sir, a daughter of my own could hardly have melted me so soon. She stood before me the very picture of wretchedness, her bosom heav- ing, her eyes drooping, as though she could not bear one ray of light to fall upon her and her miserable lost life. I sat like one struck dumb, and at last, only to say something:-- "'Won't you take a seat?' I said; 'you have a long way to go'; and then immediately I blushed at my own silliness,--such foolish words, you know, sir,--so out of place. But she did not seem to hear me. After a pause, she said:-- "' I did what I could to save myself in time; you know that. I plainly saw my danger - plainly -I am not naturally careless. I am not a giddy girl, dear Flor. I walked into this with open eyes,--that is, I thought I knew the path I had chosen; I little dreamed that it could lead to this. Did I say with open eyes? Yet I think they might be blinded by my tears. I cried so terribly when I saw his wound, and knew it was for me. He had often tried to make me love him, and I had told him more than once that I never would be his, except as his wedded wife. That I could never be, he told me; he had a son who was not to be defrauded of his inheritance, and who would be shocked if he gave him a young step-mother. ' As it is, we never can agree,' he said; 'and this would bring us to an open rupture.' He took some trouble to make this very plain to me, but he never succeeded in altering my resolution. I had never heard of what he called a conscience-mar- riage, and all my principles rose up against it, --not to speak of my pride, that revolted at the secrecy; If two persons are worthy of each other, I thouglt, and their consciences worthy of being called to witness what they do, why should there be a secret?

To hear that proud man,--naturally so Violent and so imperious, - to hear hMm beg and beseechl, and to see him suf. fer, and to go on living here in this solitary wilderness beside him, without a soul to help me, or any counsel, save my own weak heart, - it was hard to bear, it was terrible! and it was worse when lie never spoke to me at all for months, nor even looked at me ; and all the while I could see how his dumb passion was wearing him out; and then at last the blood from that wound! then I did feel my courage spent, and I gave myself up. Dear Flor, if there really be a woman's pride, that could havre taken her through all this un- moved,--ordeals, I inay say, by fire and water,-if there be such courage, I hardly think I could covet it! "' We took an oaths' she went on; ' we pledged ourselves to eter- nal constancy and to secrecy. My mind was at peace, -happy I was not. Not that I ever doubted hinm, whatever he may have done, --and indeed he never tried to malke me think better of him than others. This I know,--never will- he love another woman noiw, nor I another man. But there was always a heavy presentiment of evil that was to come, -and now it has come, and my life is at an end. "It is not possible for me to remain where I am,' she continued; 'between father and son. If Count Ernest had come back, and found me as his father's lawful wife, he would have smothered his boyish flame at once, and all would have been plain and open. But now  this wretched secrecy has borne its bitter fruits! I have prayed to God to guide me, and I am resolved to take it all upon myself, and, by leaving the house at once, to save what there is yet to save. If I were to die, it would be the best thing I could do for all of us, and so I must anticipate death, and take myself away, never to be heard of more.  I will tell my brother all, and thlat shall be my penance. I do not mean to spare myself, for henceforth I shall have to live all my days alone. But it will be a comfort to me, dear Flor, to think that you remember me and have a kindly feeling for me!'   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.           99 "I held her hand and stroked her cheek. 'I will never forget you, dear,' I said: 'wherever you go, my heart will follow you'; and it quite moved me to see a faint rose return to her pale cheeks, with pleasure at hearing me speak so. She drew a deep breath, as if a load had been taken off her mind; and then she begged me to keep her flight a secret. Afterwards, when it was no longer to be concealed, I was to say that she had gone to her brother to persuade him to go back to England quietly, and that perhaps she would not come back that night. "' When I am safe across the Channel, I will write to the Count,' she said; ' and as for you, my best and dearest friend, I shall always think of your love and goodness for me to my dying day.' "And she fell upon my neck, and cried so bitterly that I cried myself while I was trying to comfort her, - saying the most stupid tilings, for my poor old head was all astray. I could hardly get out the words for sobbing, and only kept repeating: ' God bless you, poor dear! bless you! don't forget your own old Flor, who wronged you so! you are far too good to be so wretched!' "As if, in this world, the good people were the best off! As if my blessed mistress had not been an angel even before she died! 6"As soon as we heard the first birds singing in the woods, the pretty creature rose and dried her eyes, and gave me her hand to say good by; and when at the door she turned round to nod to me again, she looked so lovely that I looked after hei as if I had been her lover myself, and ran to the window to see her pass through the little gate, and walk towards the wood to wave my hand to her again. The day was dawning gradually over the trees, that all stood still, as if asleep, till the dew fell, and then they began to stir in the morning air. To this moment I can remember how I felt, as I put out my hot head to cool the fever in it, and let the fresh breeze blow over my hair. ' God be praised, who gave that poor girl the sense and courage to go at once, and make an end of it ' I thought one moment; and the next,--'but has she a right to go?

Yet at every step she was tak- ing farther out into the wide ,world and farther from the castle, I felt the weight on my heart loosening, and I imagined that, if only my poor dear boy were safe never to set eyes on her again, all might yet be well, and we might leave the rest to Providence. "She must have got a good start by the time our people began to be stirring about the stables and the farm-buildings, and my master never got up till several hours later. I always was the earliest in the house, and had more than enough to do and to look after, but that morning I could think of nothing at all; my head was dazed; everything seemed running in it at once. I took a whole hour to plait up my poor wisps of hair before I could make up my mind to leave the room. For I thought I should meet the Count, and, if he were to ask for Mamsell Gabrielle, I was sure to stammer and hesi- tate, and very likely to confess the whole. However, I could not hold out any longer; I wanted so much to go and see what my poor Count Ernest was about. I went along on tiptoe, and slowly up the stairs. My legs shook as though I had grown to eighty in a single night. "I listened at the door of his room, and, hearing nothing, I softly opened it and went in. The room was empty, and the bed un- touched; but he must have spent the night here, for the candles were burned down to their sockets. It all looked so sad, it made me begin to cry again, as I went about setting things to rights, and opening the windows. I looked out far over the tree-tops, and fell a thinking. I can remember that I almost went into a passion with that faded dog-boy there on the tapestry, who grins and looks so happy, showing all his teeth. ( Whatever happens, that fool must grin,' I said; sorrow had made me that distracted, that even a pic- ture on the wall could provoke me, sir.' "All at once I heard the piano in the room below me, long be- fore the time when my master was used to rise. ' The whole world is topsy-turvy,' I thought, as I went down stairs. Now that I was sure not to meet the Count, I wanted to go and look for my dear boy all over the castle and about the grounds.   ('U /U/V] b "JAIVCiaL)- U A- J/t/lvl':. lUl "' When I came to the door of my lady's room, where we had put Mamesell Gabrielle, I could not pass it. I felt drawn in against my will, as it were,--it was like those places where dreadful murders have been committed. I stood staring at the glass, and talking to myself like a mad-woman. We women are a weak and a curious race, you know, sir, and have a right to be, as our mother Eve was before us; and I could not help fumbling, about till I had found the mechanism; and then I thought I would take one peep at the hid- den passage,-just one peep, I thought; but when the mirror turned upon its hinges, I had one foot over without intending it, and then the other, and I found myself walking on, hardly ven- turing to breathe, and the door had closed behind me of itself. I was not frightened. If I really never did get out, or saw the light of day again, what would it matter? What is there in the world to please me, where all is temptation and disappointment, and where one man plays the part of Lucifer to the other? '"I saw a faint streak of light falling through a crack, and so I went on till I came to the steps; I went up cautiously; I heard the piano getting louder and louder as I went up. While I live, I shall not forget that strange feeling; the dark, dank air, like a prison, and the beautiful music pealing above my head. "I felt as if I were in my grave, and thousands of birds were sing- ing over the sod, and I could hear them and understand them all. At the last step I stood still. ' Where does this lead to?' I thought,' and shall I be able to get out?' and I turned cold all over, when I saw that this passage could only lead into Count Henry's morning-room, just where the piano stood. If I were to walk in suddenly, what would he think of me? "Then I saw the light shining through a hole in the wall, and that made me go on again. The mirror had been injured at one place, which looked like a spot or blemish, and it had often vexed me while I was cleaning it; and now I saw that it had been done on purpose, to enable one to look into the room and. see that all was safe, before putting me springs in motion and opening the door. "I crept close up and peeped in. Count Henry was sitting at 1-    *                          ,-  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6538-00000053"/> 1.02'        GOOD -STOrS. tile piano, in his short velvet morning-dress, with his back turned to the mirror; and all the windows were standingc wide open, I was going to steal away again, but the music bewitched me, as it were; I never could get enough of it. It was easy enough for it to steal away the heart of a poor young lonely creature like Gabrielle, when it could so bewilder an old thing like me! It all came of itself while he was playing, out of his own head. It was as if he were 'talking with the spirits within him, and soothing them when he felt his fits of passion coming on ; and at those times the music sounded like two distinct and separate voices discoursing,- angry first, and quarrel- ling, and then at peace. "What storm was raging in him that morning I do not know. He could not be thinking of Gabrielle' brother, -he was not un- easy about that, - for he was fully persuaded that she herself would never leave him,-neither of Count Ernest; for what did he know of what he was feeling? But he must have a kind of pre- sentiment that some great event was impending; for the music was like the sound of a coming storm, and one could hear the first roll of the distant thunder. It made me feel so frightened and uncom- fortable, -partly because of the confined air in that little passage, -that I stood up, and was just going away, when the door of the antechamber opened, and my dear Count Ernest came in. "His father looked round, but he made a sign to beg him not to let himself be disturbed, but to go on playing, and he sat down in an arm-chair to wait; he sat so that I could see his face straight be- fore me. There was something so grave and grand about it, and yet so subdued and peaceful,- he looked handsomer than I ever saw him. He did not raise his eyes to the secret door; it was pain and grief to him to know that it was there. He was very pale, and he looked down as if he were studying the pattern of the inlaid floor, with a look of forced cheerfulness that made my heart ache. And though he never moved an eyelid, I saw his eyes get- ting wet, and then twor large tears glittering beneath his eyelashes, while his mouth remained as quiet and sweet as ever. I saw that the music was too much for him, and almost overcame him. His   T. an J n 3 E! oM.         ;    1 O COUNT ERATEST'S HOME.           1 father did not seem to notice it; he went on playing for some time longer, until at last, osing with a magnificent unison of all the voices, he shut down the piano, got up, and took a few hasty turns about the room. He never looked at his son (in general he seldom did); but still he appeared to be in a good-humor, and took up a new fowling-piece that was lying on te table to show it him. i"You are just come when I wanted you,'he said. 'I was going to send over Pierre to ask whether you would like to take a ride with me through the forest. Pierre tried this gun yesterday, and says he thinks it is even better than my English one; did he speak to you about it?' "'No, he did not'; and the young Count rose also ;'and I rather fear I shall not be able to accompany you, my dear father. I have come to a sudden decision about Stockbolm, and I mean to go at once. You say, very justly, that it would be far too soon for me to stay here and bury myself amonm these woods, without'at least one trial of what I may be fit for in this world. And I am come to say good by, - that is, if you still approve of my decision as much as I hoped you would, concludinr from the wishes you have so frequent- ly expressed.' "He spoke calmly and 'cheerfully; but oh! it was woe to me to hear him! I could hear every word through the slight par- tition, sand I held my breath, for I even fancied they must hear how my heart was beatingt. I did not dare to move, and so I stayed, and heard all they said. I found I was to lose him again; and when to see lim, who could tel? . never, perhaps. I knew what made him go. He was resolved never to see the girl again. But- she was gone; and what would they do when they found that out? Wlien I tried to think of this, 'my five senses failed me, and so I rather listened to what they were saying. I cannot repeat every word, but it wras beautiful to hear my young Count explaining to his father, how the post at Stockholm had just then acquired a great importance, in consequence of our commercial relations, and what not; and how clearly he saw it all, and knew what he had to do. "Meanwhile the elder Count was walking up and down, and  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6538-00000054"/>  never spoke a word till he had done. Then he stopped short be-  fore his son, and held out his hand to him. ' You are perfectly right  in all you say, and I entirely approve of the step you are about to  take,' he said. ' I know it is a sacrifice to my wishes on your part,  for, in fact, you are not a man of aoflo'n; you have far more of the German scholar in you; but in your new position you will soon have shaken off the last vestige of school-dust; and by and by you  will agree with me, that my wishes were' entirely for your own  good. When do you start?' "'This very day, if you approve, sir; I would take Fatme as far as the station, and Pierre could take the horses back in the evening. My things can Jbe sent after me.' "His father nodded, and agrain they remained silent for a time.  My Ernest had still something weighingv heavy on his mind, -that  I saw by his face.  "At last he said: ' And you, lmy dear fathher, what have you de- cided upon doing? Whiat are your plans for the present?  Do you mean to spend the winter Ihere. '  "'I rather think so. I fiancy I have lad enough of being tossed  about. A quiet time in polrt to rest would do no harm for a  change.' " This is a solitary place,' returned his son, ' and our neihllbors  are not much resource.  Will you laugrh at me if I ask you a R strane question? Did it never occur to you to think of marryin  again?' "The Count gave a  loud laugh. ' Well, I must say, you do ask  searching questions,' he said. 'You would like to do a good action before you go, and see that your father is well provided for. Give  it up, my son, give it up! A second marriage is but a second folly; d and, if age cannot save us from folly, youth at least should not  tempt us to it.' "' You are not speaking seriously, sir,' returned Count Ernest;  I   have found you younger this timne than when I left you five  years ago. If you really should decide on settling here, only con-  sider how a  young mistress would improve the place,-one who    would prevent your growing old before your time, and, when that time does come in good earnest, would make those quiet years pleas- ant to you. I know that I leave you in the best of hands,' he went on; 'our Fior is fidelity itself, but you require more than she can do for you, and as I cannot tell when I may come back, I --' "He stopped short, and I saw that he had some trouble to hide his emotion. His father turned a searching look on .him, and, after a pause, he dryly answered: 'Enough of this; I am very well as I am; and, though I may find other ways than you would of combat- ing dulness, I shall not run to seed as you suppose. There are foxes enough to be shot, while my hand can hold a gun; and, when the end of all ends comes, I shlall sit down and write my memoirs, as a pattern to this generation of propriety,-that is, a pattern to be avoided.' H' He now evidently expected his sonl to take his leave, but Count Ernest -stood still, with his eyes fixed on his father's face. Count Henry did not seem to feel quite easy-under them; he looked an- noyed, and added, as if in jest: ' Well, and don't these prospects please you? I do believe you have a match all ready made for me, and intend to show me that your talents in the diplomatic line are gfreater than I should have supposed. May I ask who the lady is? I confess I am getting curious. Is it young F., with her Madonna eyes, and her liberal portion of freckles? or Comtesse C., with her shortened leg, and her never-ending giggle, who would persuade herself and the world (though the world knows better) that she has not seen sixteen summers?' And so he went on, through the list of all the young ladies in the neighborhood, caricas tUrina them with a few sharp strokes, but without succeeding in mnolng a muscle of his son's countenance. "When he came to the end: 'You are on the wrong track, dear father,' he said; 'it is no fine lady I am thinking of, nor should I like to see any of these in this house, as its mistress. But there is a prize much nearer home, that I should be glad to see you win.  Have you really never noticed the'young lady who helps our Flor  to rule the house? She is fond of you, I know. Her passionate  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6538-00000055"/> attachment to you has grown too strong for her to conceal it even from herself.' "The Count stood rooted to the ground, and I saw a dark frown gather on his brow. But he always knew how to command hm- self. With a laugh that did not come from his heart: 'Mort de ma vie ' he cried, -'LMiamsell Gabrielle? Why, that would in- deed be a triumph of the new school over the old, if you have managed to discover more in these three %veeks than I in the last two years!' "'To be candid with you, sir,' said Count Ernest,' I must hon- estly confess that I did not discover this until last night,- not, at least, with any certainty. I was witness to the poor girl's struggle when her brother wanted her to go with him, and I saw thatt it would be the death of her to palrt from you.' "'Part from   me!-stuff and  nonsense!' cried his father. 'That brother of hers startled her: he is a hard-headed fool. It was his coming here so fast and furious, as if it were a matter of' life and death, that friglhtened the girl out of her senses. I tell you you are mistaken. And, besides, who says she is to go? She is of age, and can do as she likes ; I mean to take care that she does;- her free will shall be protected.', Another pause, a-ld then the son: 'Are you sure she may not have to suffer for being so protected?  Let me own to you that I went over to X., last night, to speak to this brother of hers. He told me how chivalrous you had been, in defending his sister on one occasion, and also what had been said about it at the time. If you do not intend to sacrifice your protegee's good name forever, it' is indeed high time to dismiss her, or to-give her a name that will effectually protect her. Dearest father,' he continued, while my master sat silent, angrily gnawing his lip, do not be angry with me for venturing to interfere with any of your decisions. I have set my heart on seeing you in possession of this good fortune, which  has been so long within your reach, though you would not see it. Jf course, I  do not know how you may feel towards this young ady:   whether you would care to see her go- out alone into an   uncertain world, -alone with her secret, her grief, and her love for you. But if you really have one spark of feeling for her, why not take a creature so fair and good, and make her your own forever? If you do decide in haste, I am certain that you will not repent at leisure. "All this time I had never taken my eyes off my darling's face, and I saw it glowing and reddening, till his eyes were all glittering with tears. 4s He was standing before his father, and had taken one of his hands in his. Strange boy his father said 'I do believe you mean it,-you would like to make me leap into this adventure blindfold, as my own folly has often made me do in others. What is there about this girl to make you plead her cause so passionate- ly? And, when I come to think of it, your proposal is not so utter- ly to be despised. I hlave only to think of our high-born neighbors, and of their indignation when they hear that Count lias mar- ried his housekeepers to feel ready for the wedding at once. It would be a satisfaction, but I am afraid it is a satisfaction of which I must deprive myself. Not that there is anything in your taste to be objected to, she comes of a respectable family, and has manners that many a countess might envy her. Yet, it won't do, Ernest give it up-yes, I will talk to her brother ; we will do all that is right to be done, only do you go away now, and leave me to myself for half an hour. Why, he went on, as his son still kept hold of his hand; ' are you not satisfied tlat I should have done this proposal of yours the honor of thinking it worth a moments consideration? Enough of this! I s3a1 again. I acknowledge the kindness of your heart, that would be glad to see me happy; but hearts are giddy tlings, and are apt to come to their senses after it is too late!' ; And hle talked on in this style, without ever once looking at his son. Then he got up, went to the piano, struck a chord or two, went to the window, and shut it hastily. "' There is something in this you will not tell me,' said his son. 'You are disturbed. You have a reason you will not give me for not doing as I request.  I know your way of looMng on these disd  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6538-00000056"/> 108         GOOD STORIES. parities of position; therefore it is not that,- and what else can it be? For I see by your agitation that the young lady is not indiffer- ent to you! ' "He waited for an answer, in vain. 'I know,' at length he said, very sadly, in a tone of deep dejection, 'I have never been -so for- tunate as to find my way to your confidence, though, God knows, I have sought it with all my heart; and I never regretted this so much as I do now; but I have hbeen fortgetting myself, this con- versation has lasted too long already. You think it absurd that a son should take his fathelr's happiness to heart. I have only now to beg your pardon, and to say good by.'  "The Count turned frolm the window to look at his son frolm headl to foot, as if he would read through him. "Go out into the world, my son, and let the bitter blasts froln the so-called summits of society blow over your blrains awhile, and cool down the effervescence of that strange fanciful heart of yours, and blow away the last of your romantic prejudices. You will soon come and thank me for not having consented to give you a young step-mother, and perhaps a batch of younger brothers. Your fortune would never be sufficient to enable you to move with ease in the society to which youll belong, if you lhad to divide it with a young step-mother, and possibly with other children, far less if you gave it up to them, and had to live on your mother's portion only. On the other hand, a woman I had made a Countess of, I should not choose to leave a beggar. Now, have I spoken plainly; and do we understand each other?' "' We do,' slowly repeated Count Ernest, with a faltering voice; and, after a moment of meditation, he went up to the table, where among other things there was an inkstand, and, taking out a sheet of paper from his father's portfolio, he wrote a line or two, standing where he was. He had hardly finished, when the elder Count came up. ' What on earth are you about? What is this new fancy of yours?' he cried; 'I do believe you are getting up a comedy. I hope you do not mean -' "My dear father,' said Count Ernest, placing the written paper   COUNT ERNEST'S HO1E.           109 before him, "let me entreat you to do nothing hasty; see here what I have written; and, if you really would make me happy before I o, and do me the greatest favor, please put your seal and signature here, as ratification of mie. I have sometimes thought I must seem stranger to you than any stranger, our ways of thinking are so different. At the age when sons grow up to be their fathers friends, I1 have been pained to find how little I have been yours. You have given me this moment a strong proof of your affections But if you repent of it, if you would annul it, and prove to me that I am still as far from understanding you, or doing anything to make you happy, as my poor mother always was,-then, I saly, destroy that paper.' Count Henry took it, and I saw his hand tremble, as he held it up to read it. Ernest,' he said ; ' this is simply impossible, there never can be any question of your giving up this property, to have it settled on a step-mother and her heirs; it can't be done.' "The paper fell upon the table, and the two stood side by side for a minute without speaking, and that sunny room was still as death, "All-at once we heard a quick step coming through the ante- chamber, and Pierre came, out of breath, to say: "' Monsieur le Comte! Is M. le Comte aware that MamseUll Ga- brielle is missing, and that the ranger's assistant met her before daybreak, walking on the road to X., and that Mamsell Flor has been missed as well, and looked for all over the house without being found? ' The caleche to the door, this instant! ' cried my master, snatching at his hat, that lay oni a chair. ' Stay' he called after the man, who was already on the threshold; 'my horse, - have it sad- dled and brought round! allons!' "I will accompany you, sir, if I may,' said Count Ernest; ' as it is, I am all ready for the road.' And he would have hurried away after the servant, but his father held him back, looked in his face without saying a word, and then, suddenly folding him in Lis arrms, they stood for a moment heart to heart. After that I saw no   O              .0  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6538-00000057"/> 10         GOOD STORIES. more; my eyes were running over, and everything was swimming  before me. By the time I had got them dry again, - and that was not easy, - the room was empty, and only the paper on the table was there to tell me that it had not been all a dream. "How I felt as I got down the winding staircase, you may fancy, sir; when I had found the door again, groping about withl my trembling hands, and stepped out of the dark into the broad day- light again, I felt as if it were a quite new world I was coming to. I heard the horses' hoofs on the pavement of the court, and I saw from the window father and son galloping over the bridge together, while the light carriage that was going to fetch our Gabrielle was driving gayly after them in the morning sunshine. "Yes, sir, and it was a pretty sight to see: that poor thing that had stolen out of the house by the back gate, before daybreak, and all alone, coming back joyfully by the light of noonday, driving over the great drawhridge, and her master on his grand horse, rid- ing proudly by her side, and him leaping from his saddle, to open the carriage door, and give her his arm to lead her up the steps! "And there was a still finer sight to be seen eight days after, when there was a fine wedding at the castle. They were married in the great saloon, and the dinner was down stairs in the hall; and there sat Count Henry at the master's table, with his beautiful young wife, and her brother; and all of us dined at the other table, with flowers and wreaths all over, and the band from X. playing in the gallery. They danced till long past twelve o'clock, and the young Countess danced with every one, from the steward to the as- sistant ranger, and it was talked of all over the country, ever so long after. But to me, sir, the best of all was wanting, and I can- not say that I felt really happy for a single moment. For my dear Count Ernest had not returned with them that morning, and I had not even been able to take leave of him. And all the time the band was playing, I could not keep from thinking of him, at sea, on his way to Sweden, in that cold night, hearing nothing but the salt waves beating against the ship, and the rough winds blowing. "When the wedding gayeties were over, everything in the castle   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.          1 1 went on as it had done before, only that we spoke of our gracious } Countess, instead of Mamsell Gabrielle, and that the new-married pair rode out every day, and that often, when my master played, his Hi young wife sang.                         ; "We had no visits, for those my master and mistress paid among  the families of the neighborhood were not returned; at which our : master only laughed, and, indeed, it seemed as if nothing ever could succeed in spoiling his temper again. If anything occurred among i the servants, or in the stables, which we would have been afraid to tell him formerly, we had only to speak to the Countess, who  always knew how to make things smooth, and to charm away his angry mood. "Only once I heard her beg and beseech in vain. It was soon  after New Year's day, the snow was very deep, and we lay buried among the woods, as if we had been walled up. An invitation came from the grand duke to a ball at court. It was a ball where all the grand folks of the whole country came together. Last win- ter our master had gone there too, though he was not in very high favor in that quarter. A court-lackey on horseback had brought the invitation. My master and mistress were at table, and I still see the Count, as he pushed away his plate, and rose and walked about the room. "'What an insult!' he cried, while his wife seemed anxious   j to quiet him. 'They have not included my wife in this invitation ; and yet we shall both do them the honor of going.' And, in spite of all that the Countess could say or pray, he made the man come in, and ordered him to take back his answer, that the Count j had accepted the invitation, both for himself and his Countess.  { I "After that he seemed in particularly good spirits, and never  i ninded the Countess's petitions, but kissed her forehead, and said:  Don't you be frightened, child. It is the first time I ever re- turned an insult with a favor; I choose to show them that you are ;heir superior, and you must not spoil my sport.' "And so it really came to my dressing my Gabrielle -I mean - ny gracious mistress--for a ball. She wore a beautiful white  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6538-00000058"/> "2         GOOD STORIES. satin dress, with a wreath of scarlet and gold in her hair, and she looked like a queen. "' Comme une reine,' said Monsieur Pierre, who rode before the sledge with a lantern; and sweet she did look, as she nodded to me out of her veils and furs, to say good by, and my master, who drove himself, was just cracking his whip to start. I was quite in love with her myself, and sat up all that longr night awake by the fire, ready to recEive her when she came home. I will not weary you, sir, by repeating all I was thinking of the while. It made me ,go to sleep myself, and I only waked towards morning at the noise of the sledge-bells. When I came (running down, the Count was already leading his Countess up to her room. Neither of them seemed tired at all; they looked as bright and happy as if something particular had occurred to please them. When he said good night, he took her tenderly in his arms,- before me, sir, and all the servants, -held her there for a minute, as if he had forgotten the whole world besides. I saw how much moved she was, and I followed her into her room to help her to undress. As soon as we wele alone, she fell upon my neck in tears, and, as she always had treated me as a mother, she told me all that had taken place. They had created a great sensation, when they came in, later than the rest. The duchess, who was a veryv haughty woman, had not said a word, when the Coumit led her up and presented her as his wife, But the young duke had been excessively courteous, and had opened the ball with her, and hadl distinguished her more than all the other ladies. She had felt com- pletely at her ease, and I could easily see that she had been the reigning beauty. "But, to her great alarm, she had come upon that rude English Lord, standing at one of the card-tables, and only on seeing her hus- band so indifferent and calm had she been able to recover her self- possession. After one of the dances, the Count had led her into another room to take some refreshment; and there he had intro- duced some gentlemen to her. 3lMeanwhile the Englishman had come in with some ladies, unobserved; and he had raised his eye-   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.,          113 glass with a fixed stare at her, and had said quite out loud: ' For a clhamnber-maid, she is not without tournure.' There had been a dead silence; the Count had changed color, and soon after he had said, in a tone of the greatest indifference: 'Look there, Gabrielle, don't you see a striking likeness between the gentleman who has just come in and that ill-bred person who was once so rude to you, and was served with a taste of my horsewhip and my pistols as the con- sequence? I rather think the horsewhip would have been enough; people who know him are apt to think him hardly worth the powder and shot.' 4'You can fancy, sir, how my poor Countess felt when he said this. However, she heard no more just then, for the Duke came in- to the refreshment-room after his partner, and was politeness itself, and all attention. I fancy more than one of these high-born ladies must have gone green and yellow with envy and jealousy. When the fete was over, and my master and mistress took their leave, the English Lord had followed them in a very insulting manner, and, when they came to the staircase, had whispered a word or two in the Count's ear; who had then stood still, and had answered quite loud enough to be heard by all the footmen and some of the court- gentlemen who were standing about:- "'This time you will have to look for another player at that game, my lord. I have found a prize, since then, which I have no intention of staking on one card, - even if I were certain that the cards were not false, as they did say in the London clubs some people are in the habit of using. In case you should require any further satisfaction, my horsewhip is still, as it was then, very much at your service.' "And with that he had gape, and left the fellow standing. On their way home, he had said to Gabrielle: 'I trust this is the last remnant of my past life that will ever rise up to throw a shadow on my present happiness. You alone are all my present and all my future in this world.' And he had said more of the like loving, heart-felt things that kept her warmer in the cold and snow of that winter night than all her furs.

"From that time they lived alone, and were all and all to each other, refusing every invitation that came from court, -only now and then they took little journeys; though it was easy to see that they were always happiest at home, among our solitary woods. The Countess never changed to me, and used always to tell me every- thing. The only thing we never -spoke of was what had passed between us on that awful morning, when she had wanted to go awar. I never heard whether she confessed the real reason to her hus- band. I rather think it likely that she did, for now the Count had a peculiar look of tenderness whenever he mentioned his absent son, even when he got a letter from Stockholm. When that hap- pened, he would send for me up stairs, and talk to me of my dar- ling, and give me the love he never forgot to send me. Once or twice a year he wrote to me himself; familiarly and kindly, as ever, but never a word of what was most important to me, - not a word of what he felt or thought. "When he had been about two years away, he wrote to announce his intended marriage with a high-born young lady in Sweden, and to ask for his father's consent To me he wrote, that he hoped I should not withhold my blessing, as his bride was exactly such as I would have chosen for him myself. And afterwards he sent me her picture,-an angel's face, all gentleness and goodness. Before I had seen it, I used sometimes t ttorment myself with thinkinffl that he had only made up his mind to marry in order to set his father's mind at rest. But I knew those great, clear, innocent eyes of hers must have found their way to his heart. Then came accounts of the wedding, and of their beautiful wed- ding-tour among the mountains. You will hardly believe it, sir, but even then the young Countess found time and thoughts to spare for poor old Flor. She wrote to thank me for having taken such care of her Ernest all his life, she said. But there was no word of their coming back to Germany, especially after the pair of twins was born, - which event was an occasion of great rejoicing here in this castle. The Count used to 'talk of going to Sweden, and taking me along with them; and you will believe that my   COUNT ERNEST'S HOME.          115 head was turned by the thoughts of such a journey, and such a meeting. "But it is not for us to number our days: many an old cripple or useless pensioner has to stand sentinel a weary while, watching for the call, and waiting to be relieved; and other lives, on which a whole world of happiness hangs, are taken, - we do not know how or why. "One day Count Henry was carried home for dead. He had been thrown from his horse, and had received some internal injury which no doctor was able to discover. He came to himself again, but only with a faint light of consciousness or memory. He knew the Countess and me, but no one else, - Pierre he would not suffer in the room at all. He took him for a rat, and clried incessantly: 'Take it away! catch it! set a trap for it! it has gnawed away my wedding garment.- See what a hole it has bitten in it!' "And then he would call upon his son so movingly, it was im- possible to hear hiln without tears. The Countess had written im- mediately to Count Ernest, to tell him the state in which his father was; I only feared he mitlrht colue too late. "Do not ask me, sirl; to describe those days, and the nighlts we had to live through, nor the heart-rending sight it was to, see that young wife, who never uttered one word of complaint, but rather was a support to us all. On the twelftl day the young Count came. We had hardly expected him so soon, and we were almost startled when he entered the sick-room. "As soon as he heard the door open, my master waked up from the lethargy in which he had been lying, and sat up, and, in a voice which I  shall hear all my life, he cried, 'Ernest, my son!' and burst into a passion of tears, and wept as though his spirit were passing away through his eyes. After that he became surprisingly cheerful and sensible, and lay quietly, holding his son's hand in his. He talked again without rambling; so for one moment we hoped the worst was over, and the turn taken towards getting better.

"You must excuse me, sir, for telling you all this so particularly, but you must let me say a few words more, to tell you how it ended. Alas! the end came soon enough! The very day after the funeral Count Ernest went away again, after having done all that could be done by seals and documents to make the Countess complete mis- tress of the whole. For they had found no will. Count Henry knew well enough that he had only to say, Ernest will provide for you,' to close his eyes in peace. "(If there is anything I can do for you, I beg you to command me in every way'; my dear Count Ernest had said to his step- mother, before he went. ' If you should ever find this solitude too much for you, I hope you will remember that my wife is waiting to receive you with open arms. "She looked at him affectionately, and held out her hand, which he-respectfully took and kissed. "(You are well cared for,' he said in a low voice ; ' I leave you with my own faithful Flor, -I only beg you will bring her with you when you come to Sweden.' ' Of course this was more than I could hear with dry eyes. So I threw my apron over my face, and ran away; but in the pas- sage he held me fast, and kissed me quite vehemently, and I felt how his heart was beating, and the hot tears from his eyes came dripping on my gray hairs. "My boy, my Ernest, my dearest master!' I said, I God bless you for having come, as he has already blessed you for your truth and tenderness! He did not take your fathernuntil you had heard from his dying lips that he well knew what a son he was leaving. Go, and God be with you! Give old Flor's love to your Countess, and to the darling children; tell them that Flor has no other wish on earth but that the whole world fmight know Count Ernests heart as she knows it, and then the whole world would be ready to lay their hands beneath your feet, as she is.' "He broke away from me, and ordered his horses to meet him   COUNT ERNNEST'S HOME.         117 at the top of the walk that leads up the forest. He walked on before, and I heard people say that he had wandered about the forest, taking leave of the spots he loved, and now looked upon for the last time. So even at that time he must have resolved never to return. He could not be happy again in his old home. "And so -I knew that I had taken leave of him forever. I would have fretted still more about it, only I was so taken up with my mistress. She pined away; white and quiet, and without a mur- mur. It was just as if strong hands were dragging her down into her husband's grave. Even dead, that proud man ruled her. When I wrote the sad tidings to Count Ernest, -it is hardly a year ago,- he answered me immediately.. He said I was to go to them, at all events; and the young Countess wliote and begged me, as hard as one can beg.  My Ernest had given up his post, and settled where they are living still, on a very fine estate among the hills, close by the sea, where I suppose it must be beautiful. "I would come - myself to fetch you,' he wrote; ' only I am too conscientious in my duties as a husband and a husbandman to go from home in harvest-time.' "He did not like to give his real reason. But all this melted me, and I got my bits of things together, and gave over my keys to the new steward. The Countess's brother had a pride of his own, and never would have anything to do with her inheritance; and so, one fine morning, I really was quite ready to go, and drove away. But when I got to that road in the hollow, to the place where one can see these chimney-tops just peeping above the woods, my heart failed me all at once, and I jumped out of the carriage, and ran home as if the fiends had hunted me. And, when I got back into our court, I felt as if I had been a hundred years away. "Ah, sir, it is no good transplanting a rotten tree! -it should be left standing where it grew, waiting for the axe. Heaven knows I would gladly give the few years I have to live to see my Ernest's children only once; to take them in my arms, and hug those darling babes! but I know I could never be dragged so far.  &#xD;<pb n="118" xml:id="VAC6538-00000061"/> "8         GOOD STORIES.

WHEN I promised, Tom, to write you an account of Castle Shaughnessy and Peg, remember you gave me your word in return that you would not look at what I had written till you had gone back to your ship for good, and the ocean lay between you and the persons who figure in my story. Be charitable, if you can, to some of those last, when you have repocketed the manuscript. But don't ask me to practise as I preach. Gorman Tracey and I are so much akin that we had once a com- mon relative.  "German," said I one day, " that old lady at Ballyhuckamore is dead at last, and has left her estate to -" "To you!" he said, with a grimace. "Like the luck of you rich chaps! Lord! - To think of how that old lady used to pet me when I was a boy, and never saw you in her life. I wish you joy, old fellow, from the bottom of my heart! Ugh! How I envy you! Ballyhuckamore! (musingly). "A beggarly old place, I'll be bound!" said I. "A house like a barn, a potato-field, and a pigsty." "Not a bit of it. But I won't tell you. Pearls to swine, ugh! Ballyhuckamore!  I wonder whether little Peg O'Shaughnessy ought to be grown up' yet." "Little Peg O'Shaughnessy?" said I. "Yes, O'Shaughnessy of Castle Shaughnessy. But you don't know, and never will, you beastly bigot of a Saxon!" "Little Peg?" said I again, as we walked on. "A mop-headed little flirt who used to drop frogs down my back.

Peg's toes came through her shoes." "Grown up now, you were saying?" c Should think so. Lost count of the years. "' Any more pretty girls at 13Ballyhuckamolre?" s Bless your heart! there never was a place so overrun with them. When I thinlk of the crowd that poor old lady used to have about her in Ballyhuckamore Hall of a Christmas eve! I was always in love with half a dozen of them at a time. But you don't know. I believe I was to have married Peg, and settled down at the Hall, whenever I succeeded to the estate. What a gathering there should have been there this next Christmas, if I lad had your luck!" ' Then I'll tell you what," said 1, " we'll have the gathering there in spite of fate. You and I will go together; you shall intro- duce me to all the Ballyhuckamnores, and we'll hleave such a house- warming as never was there before." If we had not been walking down Fleet Street, I believe Gdrmnan would have thrown up hs lhat and given three cheers. It was in July that we talked thus; and, when December drew near, we had not forgotten our plan. I need not describe Ballyhuckamore to you who know it. I never was so agreeably disappointed in anyplace. A snow-storm had just cleared away as we drove to the Hall by a short cut through the wood, with the dry branches crackling like fire-works under our wheels. A sulky red sun was dropping behind a copse, seem- ing to kindle sparks in the underwood, glowering on the boles of the oaks, throwing crimson splashes on the whitened knolls, and wisping a mazy, murky light about the deepening gloom of the brown stripped trees on before us.  German was in a state of wild exhilaration, and I myself was in unexpected delight with my new possession. t( Let us alight," I said, " arid send this machine back to the vil- lage whence it came. We shall enjoy better to walk through this very jolly wilderness." And so it was that we arrived on foot, and without fuss, at Bally huckamore Hall.   "TTLE PEG O'SHAUGHNESSY.         1f I felt curious to see the house, and quickened my steps as we came up a by-path in the shrubbery which broulght us out upon the gravel sweep under the front windows I remember doing so, and how the next moment my   ton was fixed, not upon the old house frowning before me, but upon a lady, who was standing on the top of my flight of Ballyhucklamore steps, with my Ballyhucka- more hall-door lying open behind her. And such a lady! She I held up her green velvet riding-habit with both hands, and her little boots were almost lost in the snow, which lay thick upon the steps.. She had a handsome brunette face, and banlds ofn magnificent hair- under her riding-hat. She looked about thirty years of age, had a perfect figure and a jewelled whip, and seemed in the act of takling counsel with herself upon the weather. These were the items re- garding her that I summed up during the space of some half-dozen seconds. "Tracey," said I, " is there any mistake about the place; or did you ask any friends to meet us here? Can this be little Peg?" "Stuff and nonsense!" he said; " there is no mistake, and I know nothing about it. Peg's hair was as white as flax. Shabby Peg got up in that extravagant style! I hlave no idea who this may be. Some wonderful bird of passage." Meantime the lady had tripped into the house, whither we fol- lowed as quickly as possible. We took off our hats to her in the hall, where she stood transfixed by amazement at our appearance, with her hand on the drawinl-room door. We turned into the dining-room, where a speedy summons brought the housekeeper to us, quivering in black silk, and blooming in a cap like a pickled cabbage. "O sir, an' I give you my word it's hardly ever I took my eyes for one blessed minute off the avenue since mornin'; an' to think of your slipping in unknownst to us afther all! An' there's Lady Fitzgilbboa an' her friends that were drove in for shelter from the storm two hours ago; an' her ladyship's runnin' in an' out, an' thinkin' she'd never get away before you'd arrive, sir.

O, sir;- a beautiful lady, -a widow lady, sir, - who has taken Kilbanagher Park and furnished it splendid, so as it's fit to dazzle your eyes, sir. An' she's thatrich, they say, she'd as lief eat bank-notes as bread and butter." I looked at Tracey, and Tracey looked at me, and we both looked at the window. It was snowing more heavily than ever, and growing dark besides. There was only one thing to do. In a few minutes I was in the drawing-room, and had transformed the uncomfortable intruders into my bidden guests, who had promised to stay the night under my roof. Lady Fitzgibbon sat on my right at dinner. How charming she was that evening! How her eyes sparkled over the champagne, and how those languishing Eastern shadows under them enhanced the brilliancy of her complexion! How white her hands were, as she poured out our tea; how musical her voice was, as she told us anecdotes of every one in the neighborhood! How amusingly she described the confusion of herself and friends when they heard of my arrival; how charmingly she ridiculed her own appearance! A riding-habit by way of evening dress!"A pretty figure!" she said. A very pretty figure, I thought, and, as for Gorman, he had become her slave without a struggle. What was she talking of, that she kept my friend Tracey so en- thralled? Doubtless, introducing him afresh to all his old acquain- tances; for she knew every one, -this charming widow, - and was gushingly communicative about her neighbors' affairs and her own. Her friends resided somewhere far away (the Antipodes, perhaps), but she, being her own mistress, had chosen to come, for change of air, to this delightful country. She had resided here a year; she was the centre of society in the locality; she was adored by all who knew her. She liked amusement, and believed that country neigh- bors ought to be social, especially at the Christmas season. These were the facts I gleaned from her discourse. O'Gradys, Desmonds, Burkes, O'Sullivans?  Yes; she knew them all. O'Shaughnessy? Oh (with a shrug), surely Mr. Tracey must have heard about poor Sir Pierce? No, Mr. Tracey had not heard.   ITTLE PEGS. O'SlAUGHRNESSY.       123 "O, he ruined himself, you know, and tlheh he went astray in his mind. For some years he has not been able to leave his house ex- cept on Sunday, in dread of seizure for debt." "And Pe-Miss O'Shaughnessy?" said German. "I used to know her. Such a pretty little girl!"  "Ah, poor thing I I believe she has grown up very plain. She is never seen. How they live in that old empty castle I cannot think. In town the other day (we call our posting-village town' here, Mr. Humphrey), I heard a shopman say across the counter, before delivering a parcel, "You 'll pay me for this, Miss O'Shaugh- nessy?" And the purchase in question was only some yards of printed calico, to make a dress for herself, I should think. Heigh- ho! it's such a very sad thing to be poor." Lady Fitzgibbon lifted her eyebrows, and smoothed down a green velvet fold of her dress, and looked quite able to make a supper of bank-notes. I dreamed that night that I saw her doing so; but that, after she had finished her meal, she fell into convulsions, as if she were poi- soned. It was not a pleasant dream, and somehow I never could look at the widow afterwards without thinking of it. And now, Tom, I have introduced you to one of my heroines, Lucretia Fitzgibbon. Mark her well. I am afraid I have not made her clear enough to you. Note her splendid eyes, her fasci- nating manner, the excellent footing on which she had placed her- self with the world in general; lastly, her enormous riches. We returned with her to Kilbanagher Park the next day. Tom, what a place that was! Not a venerable old homestead like Bally- huckamore; all new, bran-new, but gorgeous and voluptuous as a palace in the Arabian Nights. Astonishitlng little woman! What a taste! and what a purse!"Lucky, O Gorman," said I, " will be that man who shall replace the lamented Fitzgibbon (was he knight, or was he baronet?), and hang up his hat for good at Kil-. banagher Park."  But now for my other heroine. Tracey's old friends rallied round him, and we were soon on good terms with the best/people in the neighborhood. As for him, he had so far forgotten his former  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6538-00000065"/> 12-4         GOOD STOZRIES. self, that I was obliged on some occasions to interfere and. wake his memory. ' Tracey," said I, "I am not going to have my house-nwarming without little Peg O'Shaughnessy." (Thlle people were to stay a fortnight at the Hall, and every amusement thlat Lady Fitzaiblbon could devise was in course of' preparation for their gratification.) u She may have grown up plain, and wear a calico dress, but I ve had a curiosity to see that little girl ever since the first tilne you mentioned her. Her father may be doting, as they scay, and Castle Shaughnessy may be the veriest old rat-hole in the kingdom; nevertheless, my dear fellow, for the sake of old times you ought to go and pay them a visit. And, for the sake of new times and com- ing festivities, I will go with you." Gorman abased himself for his negligence, and we set out to- gether for the residence of the doting Sir Pierce, and his daughter who was " never seen." If ever there were a wild, old, ramshackle barrack standing on a sea-shore out of all human ken, and altogether within ghostly bound- aries, that dreary edifice is you, O Castle Shaughnessy! A wide uneven sward, too unkempt to be called a lawn, straggled from the entrance down to a rugged beach. On one side stood the ruins of a-chapel, surrounded by the family burying-ground. The waves at high tide of a winter's night must break over the tombstones. Not a tree was to be seen, not a leaf of ivy clung to the castle walls, which were weather-stained in a way that made the windows look like eyes that were always weeping. We were admitted after some parley, by a shabby old retainer with a knowing eye, who seemed to regard us as wolves in sheep's clothing. We entered a barren hall, whence all furniture hlad fled save some horns of elks brandish- in, their fangs over the several doors, and were bidden to wait in a long empty dining-room with marks of departed pictures on the walls, and some broken panes in the whistling, clattering windows. Under these last mustered the huge cavernous rocks, snug berths for smugglers' craft, among which the green, angry sea writhed, drench- ing them with torrents of foam. A monotonous thunder from   "TTLE PEG ffSHAUGHNESSY.  without made bass to the shrieking of the wind through the crannies of the room. "Poor Peg! poor Peg!" said Tracey, staring into all the blank corners. You see we lad lunched at Kilbanagher Park, and the contrast between that dwelling and this was, to say the least, notice- able. The man came back, and conducted us through endless dilapidated staircases and passages. It seemed that Sir Pierce was not so far doting but that he remembered an old friendly name. We were led into a small room at the south side of the castle, into which seemed to have been gathered all the fag-ends of comfort which had survived the general wreck of that place. Alack! they made a sor- ry show after all. Poor Sir Pierce, a feeble old man with a rest- less, choleric face, sat by a fire of turf logs built on a flagged hearth. The floor had no carpet, the windows no curtains, the master's arm- chair was worn by the constant chafing of his impatient body. A tame eagle sat on the shoulder of an attenuated couch in the win- dow, with his bright eye fixed on the sinking sun. The old man rose grandly, and received us with the air of a prince giving audience to subjects; but, looking in Tracey's face, broke down, and burst into tears. He was not quite astray in his mind after all, only a little maddened by pride and misfortune. He soon resumed his state. "Bid some of those people tell Miss O'Shaughnessy I wish to see her," he said to his attendant. a Those people " were probably the, shades of departed servants who had once tripped over one another in Castle Shaughnessy. The one shabby old retainer bowed his gray head, and went. Miss O'Shaughnessy was out walking, but presently made her appearance, evidently quite unprepared to behold us visitors. /She was a tall girl, wrapped in a plaid shawl, which looked as i t had been washed. She had no trimming on her hat but ai ckblack veil, which was thrown backward over it.

She had hazel eyes, and a profusion of light hair clinging in crushed masses to her head; but I did not like to look at her much, she seemed so shy and proud. The eagle left his window immediately, and mounted guard on the back of her chair. Sir Pierce's conversation was piteous to hear, so grand, so inflated, so ill matched with his surroundings. Yet he was not out of his senses, only anxious to remind us that he was O'Shaughnessy of Castle Shaughnessy. He tortured poor Peg, who bore it all with the constancy of a martyr. Now and again there was a burning blush, and a hurried glance in her father's face, then she was pale and proud and passive. "Order wine,"' he said at last, with a grand air, as if he knew that a banquet was in course of preparation. "Father,' she said distinctly, and looking him firmly in the face, ^ you know we have no wine. There is no such thing here." Well, I am not going to dwell further on the memory of this visit. Sir Pierce turned white, then purple, and we thought he was going to ha-ve a fit. A glance of entreaty shot fromtn Pe's pite- ous eyes to mine, and we departed. a Ah, well!" said German, " we have got enough of that place. Poor Peg! she is prettier than ever." We passed out again through the hollowness and the emptiness, the mildew and the rust, and the dreary, fallen greatness of Castle Shaughnessy. Lady Fitzgibbon prattled on my left that day at dinner, and, when the champagne corks began to fly, I thought I heard her say (or at least some woman's voice), "Father, you know we have no wine." Of course it was a fancy. Trinkets and smiles had Lucretia, but that pained, earnest tone was no part of her. I need not detail to you, Tom, all our schemes for inducing Peg O'Shaughnessy to be one of our housewarming party. She came against her will, but in obedience to her father's commands. A carriage was sent for her, with muffling; for it was a bitter frosty night, and good Mrs. Daly, my housekeeper, had lived more than     LTTLE PEG OSBHAUGHNESSY    . -12 once in the O'Shaughnessy family, and had a kindly regard for the on nthe 09Shaughness     ^    ^      T motherless girl.

A smith was busy at the wheels, surrounded by a little group of lookers-on, and a lantern glared on their faces. At sonme distance a dark figure was standing alone, over a-ghainst a white fence. . This was Peg, with a little hood drawn round her head, and the moon shining on her faorce. Hearing that the carriage would- not be ready for some time, I gave my horse in charge to one of the men, and, offering myself as escort to the young lady, asked her to proceed with me on foot towards Ballyhuckamore. She was most unwilling to do so, almost beseeching me to return as I had come, and leave her to follow at the blacksmith's pleasure. Of course I would not hear of that, and she consented at last to accompany me. I don't know that there was anything peculiar about that walk, and yet I have a singularly clear recollection of it. I had often travelled the same road, followed the same paths and turnings on the outskirts of the wood, seen the moon looking through the same rifts among the trees, and yet, somehow, it all seemed new that night. I did not attempt to account for this phenomenon. I tried to draw out my companion. She conversed with naive cleverness, all the while keeping a touch of defiant pride in her manner, as if she felt herself in the presence of a natural enemy, and was deter- mined not to be tricked into forgetting it; I humored lher in this, thinking her a child of nature, who knew nothing of the world. As we drew near the Hall, her hand began to tremble on my arm, and her replies grew vague and absent; at last she stopped short in a tremor of distress. "I am bitterly ashamed of myself, RIr. Humphrey," she said; ' but I am terrified at going into your grand hlouse, among your proud guests. That is the truth. The poor and unhappy should keep away from the rich and gay. O, I wish I could go home again!  She burst into passionate tears. Now in her distress I saw how young she was, -a mere untutored girl. Reserve had before made her more womanly than her years.   "TTLE PEG O'SHRAUHNESSY.             - "My dear child," I said, "pardon me,-I am so much older than you. The pride is all on your side. I do not want to preach you a sermon, but poverty is not a crime; it is not even the worst of misfortunes." "It is, it is," she interrupted, vehemently. "It is the cruellest of all, the most utterly killing and crushing. To escape from it, I would-" Marry a prince, or turn popular authoress?"I said, smiling. "Or rob a poor-box," she said, with a (curious little grimness of tone. "The two first alternatives being out of my power." O Peg, Peg! How those words afterwards rose up and bore witness against you! TWas all this anl artful little scene to engage a rich man's interest? Tears, moonlight, a sweet face, and a pas- sionate voice! Before a fortnight, a dozen of my lady friends would have been ready to swear to your plotting. Yet I do not see how you could have made the carriage break down, Peg. Lucre- tia's drop of poison lurked in my ear, though I thought I had washed it out a dozen times. After this little burst, she dried her eyes, like a child who has had its passion out; and we went on as before. Of course it was only to give her time to calm herself that I chose the longest way to the Hall; for I was rcry much on my guard. "The carriage is here already!"I exclaimed, seeing, as I tlhought, the identical equipage we had left behind us standing at the hall door. But no, here were servants running about, dragging down luggage, and carrying in wrappings, while a black man was gesticulating in the portico, and givig orders which nobody seemed to understand. What was this?  Some wonderful arrival, unuex- pected as Cinderella's at the prince's ball? On the stairs half a doz- en men were staggering under the weight of a large iron coffer, or safe, while at the top of the first flight stood a curious figure, eager- ly watching their operations. This figure was a thin, yellow-faced little man, wrapped in a fur-lined gown of vivid Eastern coloring. Ill health and discontent were in every line of his face, and his eyes were fixed with anxious greediness on the ascending box. The No. 4.     9  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6538-00000068"/> housekeeper was below in the hall, wringing her hands because there was no room prepared for " masther's uncle." From this I knew who my visitor was,-Giles Himphrey, my father's only brother, who had gone to India when a boy, and had scarcely been heard of since. I pressed past the burdened carriers on the staircase, and pre- sented myself to my strange relative. He had at the moment no thought to bestow on me, and merely replied to my words of wel- come by beseeching me to show him the way to the securest cham- ber in my house, so that he might direct the staggering men to de- posit their load there. I took him to my own room. This was a large apartment at the end of a long corridor, lined with the doors of other chambers. It was reached by ascending three broad steps, and a good-sized dress- ing-room opened off it. You may not remember them, Tom, for those rooms have fallen into disuse. Into the farthest corner of the dressing-room my uncle's coffer was carried, and then Giles Hum- phrey himself began examining the thickness of the shutters and the weight of the bars that held them fastened, the stoutness of panelling of the doors, the trustworthiness of the locks, and even the ward of the keys. I had thought the shutters good, but they displeased him. On his opening one a little, to glance suspiciously out on the white moon and the snow, a shock-headed bush of ivy bobbed suddenly against the pane, and almost scared his whimsical senses away.  He immediately had the window fastened up, and sent off a messenger post-haste for the smith who had mended our carriage to make him a wonderful iron shutter-bar, twice as large and as weighty as those which had for generations sufficed to guard the lives and properties in Rallyhluckamore Hall. He then olrdered a second set of curtains put up within the already comfortable and carefully drawn hangings, sand-bags to be laid down at every spot where there was a possibility of crevice in the woodwork, at the same time heaping fuel on the already blazing -fire, till the hearth- place began to glow like a furnace. Only then did he think proper to notice me, as he sat in my arm-chair, cowering towards the fire, .  .,...... ..-..'   , ,  -L,   and warming his skinny fingers at the flames. He had arrived in England only a few days before, and, not finding me at bome, had followed me here. I joked him about his wonderful strong-box. "Hist! nephew," he said, with a look of alarm, which the dan- cing firelight extravagantly heightened on his parchment face; "it holds money, riches, gold, jewels! You don't think I sold my youth and health for nothing, boy, out there? - you don't think I sold my youth and health for nothing? Eh?" " But why bring it here to torment you with anxiety? Why not leave it safe in a bank in London?" "Leave it?" staring at me as if I were a burglar;" part with what I earned so hard? Malke a present of my savings to Messrs. So-and-So?  Eh, nephew, what a silly school-boy you are still! By and by you will know the world, my lad." a' Well, well!"I said; " you will come down and see my friends." I told you, Tom, that this room was at the end of a long corridor. At the lower end, this corridor was crossed by another, a shorter one, from which the stairs descended. As my uncle and I turned the corner, proceeding toward the stairs, a door opened suddenly before us, and two womanly figures appeared on the threshold, thrown forward by the firelight from the chamber behind them. Lucretia Fitzgibbon with her arm thrown gracefully round the waist of Peg O'Shaughnessy. Did the star of all the country drawing-rooms mean to patronize -the poor little black sheep. from' the mountains on this her first entrance into society? The doors of their chambers stood opposite on the passage. Lucretia had kindly fluttered across, introduced herself to the trembling debutante, and taken her under-her wing.  "Good Lucretia!"I had almost -cried; but the hall lights fell full on the two faces as they de- scended, and I thought the sparkle of her eyes and teeth more false than they had seemed before. My lady was dressed in voluminous folds of amber silk, bedizened with laces and diamonds; Peg was dressed in a straight black gown of an antiquated brocade, which she must have ransacked from some great-grandmother's wardrobe, standing in some dim upper passage of Castle Shaughnessy. She  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6538-00000069"/> \ - 5 A a  ,ee ,He ' --o ; . . , ' '  v -  "^ ^ 132         GOOD STORIES. had folds of crimped white muslin at her throat and wrists, and a black ribbon twisted about her head, gathering up her crisp hair, and tied in a little knot upon her crown. As they swept down before us into the light below, my uncle Giles pinched my arm so wickedly that I started. "Who is that woman, nephew? By all the diamonds that ever blazed, I have not seen such a woman since I was a boy!" "Which?"I asked. c Not the flashy yellow one," he answered, a but the one with her head tied up." This was the beginning of my uncle's admiration for Peg. In the drawing-room we found the ladies in full expectation, and quite prepared to make a lion of him. The news of the wonderful coffer had reached them, and the fetching of the smith had caused no little excitement. It was current that some extraordinary locks were to be put upon the chamber doors, of which only Giles Humphrey and his servant knew the secret, and that the windows were to be- barred outside like the windows of a prison. Even Peg's arrival was now a matter of small importance. There never was such a hero as Giles Humphrey that night. He sat in the warmest corner by the fire, and monopolized the snuggest chair. He wore rings worth a king's ransom, and, audaciously defying custom, wore a gown lined with the costhest fur. He supported his feet on a footstool, while Illis black servant wrapped his knees in a royal rug. Then lhe spoke to the ladies with a mischievous rudeness, while his eyes paid them homage every moment. And then he might virtually be said to be sitting on that wonderful coffer, stuffed with riches, which -no doubt all present saw in their mind's eye supporting his puny limbs, but which, in reality, stood modestly hidden in its corner up stairs under the shelter of a gorgeous piece of tapestry, flaming in gold and colors. And when I conducted its owner to his chamber that night, the black man was squatting upon it with crossed legs, like a grotesque carving on a whimsical pedestal. Hie turned a somersault upon it, by way of obeisance, when his master appeared, and, while I stayed, presented a long cane, from which Giles Hum- phrey drew a glittering sword.   "TTLE PEG O'SHAUGHNESSY.         33 "This is my bedfellow," he said, grinning over it, and placing it on his pillow. "I hate locks, for fear of fire," with a glance of alarm over his shoulder at the blazing grate. "I will not be locked up, to run the risk of being burnt to death. But if any of the people in your house think to meddle with my little box over there - " he raised his voice, and, seizing the sword again, brandished it at the black servant, and chased him out of the room, bidding him go and tell about the weapon in the servants' hall. From the time of my arrival at Ballyhuckamore to that night I had found myself the lion of the neighborhood, and had had the felicity of knowing that I was the most important among the men in those days assembled under my roof. But now all was changed. The days of my greatness were over. A mightier than I had arisen, and another king reigned in my stead. I should not have minded if they had elected Gorman Tracey, or some one of the many decent fellows about me, to fill my place; but it was irritating to see the worship transferred from one's manly self to the shrivelled face and shrieking voice of the owner of a box 'up stairs; to see the silks and muslins making their genuflexions at the shrine of a mere mummy; to know that a heartless machine was receiving the flattery of mammas; that a capricious idiotic will was directing the motions of blushing handmaidens. And the hardest part, the very worst of it all, was that Peg O'Shaughnessy was the foremost of the band of sirens who sang round Giles Hum- phrey's chair. For here I will own to you, my Tom, that by this time the stray little black sheep from the mountains had made herself a fold in your friend's foolish heart. Was it fate so relentless, or that quaint black gown so demure, or a head of crisp fair hair, or a pair of steady gray eyes, or was it a very sweet voice full of musical digni- ty, or a timid step, which seemed always owning itself a trespasser when treading my Ballyhuckamore carpets?- was it all or any of these things which transformed your sober friend into the most loving of jealous lovers, crafty enough to weigh little words, and  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6538-00000070"/> 134 X         02OOD STORIES. count up smiles, and disregard all worldly wisdom? You cannot tell me, and assuredly I cannot tell you ; but in that frosty house- warming season Peg bloomed up under my eyes the only blossom of her sex I Chad ever coveted for my own wearing. Yet, for many days, Peg was as Giles Humphrey's right hand. 'I was shunned with a blush and a hasty word, while the crusty old millionnaire was- nourished with kind attentions and sweet compan- ionship. She helped him to his coffee, she cut the pages of his newspaper, she read to him, and adjusted his footstool. I believe she even stitched him a pocket-handkerchief or something, sitting by his side, with her pale fair cheek turned towards him. She was the envy of the drawing-room. If this pen had not forsworn senti- mentality, it might describe to you how I groaned at times that circumstances should have made of my Peg a desperate woman, ready to marry a mummy as an escape from poveirty, and how at other times I scorned her as an artful, heartless Peg, not worth my pity. But I may tell you how they whispered about her all over the house. Whispers in the drawing-room, whispers over the bed- room fires, whispers all throu'li the passages; on fine days even whispers out in the garden, and away abroad among thire woods. Buzz, buzz, buzz. Peg O'Shaughnessy was trying to entrap the millionnaire. And, O dear! who could say that Lucretia 'Fitz- gibbon was not kind, and even sisterly, to the shy, friendless girl, who was a stranger among strangers? And did no one dare to speak above a whisper, you will ask, and say a word for Peg?  O, ay!- there was one good little lady, of se-  social consequence, who ventured to suggest that the whole party stood aloof from the girl, criticising her; that the poor thing felt herself apart from the rest of the ladies; that she had no pretty morning dresses to eat her breakfast in, no handsome evening dresses to eat her dinner in, no fine riding-habit to go a-riding in; and that these wants usually press upon the female mind. That she had only one straight black gown for all times. Further, that, be- ing accustomed to wait on an old man, her father, she had taken naturally to waiting on Giles Humphrey, who was an elderly man,    "TTLE PEG-- O'SHAUGHNESSY.        135 to say the least; that hero seat beside his chair was a harbor to her, -not a pleasant one, perhaps, but still a harbor. These things were said by the blessed little lady of small social consequence, but who heard them? It was at this period of affairs, that one evening, jewels being the subject of conversation, Giles Humphrey, having drunk wine, set his eyes a-twinkling, and began to brag of certain wondrous trin- kets which were in his possession, and the like of which had never (said he) gladdened the eyes of any of the assembled company. A gentleman present, who was a judge of such matters, twitted him to make good his boast, whereupon the little man's slow blood got up, and he rushed to his chamber, knocked Jacko (so the black man was called, from his likeness, I suppose, to a monkey) off his perch on the coffer, and presently came down with a bag full of jewels fit to startle the eyes of ally prince in the Arabian Nights. There were necklaces, bracelets, and bangles, bodkins for the hair, and ear-rings weighty enough to tear the flesh of delicate ears, - gems of as many hues and cuttings as puzzled Aladdin in the cave. There were dazzling necks in plenty and arms bare to the shoulder all round about Giles Humphrey, on which he might have displayed his treasures to advantage, but it was on Peg that he chose to hangc them. He stuck bodkins of blazing diamonds in her hair; clasped a dozen chains and necklaces round her neck till they dropped below her waist, making her bust one flaring mass of splendor; put ban- gles of gold on her ankles ; and made her bare one round white arm, which hle shackled with bracelets. Blushing with confusion, and smiling in amusement at being so bedizenedl Peg, looked as quaint and as radiant as some rare old-fashioned princess stepped out-of an illuminated legend. Many an eye saw beauty in her at that mo- ment which it had never seen before. For my part, I thought she had looked more beautiful in the scarlet and whte flowers which I had given her for her bosom that morning. Where, by the way, was Lucretia Fitzgibbon during those five or ten minutes of Peg's magnificence? Positively I forget. I remember that a female-  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6538-00000071"/> -- -    - 136,         GOOD STORIES. voice (could it have been hers?) murmured in a delicate undertone that it was a pity Peg had not a right to wear the jewels, since they became her so well; and that this was the signal for my gallant uncle to begin to unclasp them and gather them into their casket again as fast as he could. As one after another dropped away from her, Peg grew pale and ceased to smile. Watching her curiously, I saw a strangely eager, stern look come over her face as bauble after bauble disappeared. Once, for a moment, her cheeks flushed, and a flash of longing sprang into her eyes; but it faded away again, and left her pale and thoughtful. I divined that she was thinking how much a few of those trinkets would do towards relieving the dis. tresses of a poor old br6ken-down father, and restoring the comfort of the barren, fallen home of the O'Shaughnessys. O Peg, Peg! Why did you let me see that look? It happened that the last of the ornaments which she relinquished -a certain bracelet - had been clasped too tightly on the swell of her plump arm, and there was a difficulty about getting it unfas- tened. One after another, we all tried our skill upon it, liavin each ample time, as we did so, to observe the fashion and the rich- ness of the ornament. The groundwork was a broad belt of gold. enriched with the most exquisite Indian filigree work, and this band was studded with at least a thousand tiny precious stones of every hue. Mark that cursed bracelet well, Tom, for it will reappear in my story. PART II. I CANNOT tell you what the reason was, but certain it is thai from that night forward Peg O'Shaughnessy declined in my uncle's favor. Some one else was presently asked to read the newspaper some one else was expected to hand the coffee. Peg was soon to tally dismissed from the service, and some one else elected in hex place. And the some one else was my Lady Fitzgibbon. Thus discharged, Peg was as one adrift on the world. She stayed much in her own room, or sat in a corner when in company   "TTLE PEG   O'SHA UGINESSY.       137 She was embarrassed in conversation, and shunned notice. She was not popular. People said she was proud and stand-off.' So, I thought, she certainly was but I believed the fault was not her OWll. For my own part I tried, without forcing particular attentions up- on her, to wear off her fear of me, and to establish a friendly foot- ing between us; and I succeeded. Knowing her better, I found that she had a bright fancy, and a large capacity for enjoyment; only the misfortunes of poverty and debt had overshadowed all the sunny side of her nature. I loved her more every day, and longed to lift her from under her cloud into the broad light of happiness. Meantime, I mused much as to whether my love might or might not be returned; on the possibility of Peg's crushing troubles having made her mercenary; on her gentle attentions to Giles Humphrey until she was set aside. I detested myself for these doubts, and endured them still. But meanwhile something occurred. One night, after we had all retired, Giles Humphrey kept me long in his bedroom, listening wearily to his wild'egotistical talk. At last I broke away from him, and was coming softly down the corridor, so as to disturb no one, when I was startled by hearing the rustle of a woman's dress, and, looking, saw by the faint light of a dim lamp two figures, a man and a woman, separating quickly, and moving in different directions. The man, I could see, was my uncle's black servant, and, after a moment's reflection, I concluded that the woman was some silly housemaid, who could not help flirting with even Jacko. The adventure did not disturb my night's rest. But the next evening it happened that, coming into the drawing- room after dinner, I looked round the room, and missed Peg. I also noticed that neither was Lady Fitzgibbon to be seen, but that did not much disappoint me. Watching iimpatiently for some time, and finding that Peg did not appear, I left the drawing-room for the purpose of asking Mrs. Daly to step up to her room, lest she might be ill. But, before doing- this, I went up stairs myself to fetch something I had forgotten in my own chamber. Going thith-  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6538-00000072"/> vFi ,an            77 H.     'Y 138-7    -  -GOOD- STORIES. er, I had to pass the end of that corridor which I have mentioned more than once before. At this hour of the evening it was lit more brightly than it had been late last night. Approaching it, I heard the same hurrying of feet I had then heard, and the same rustling of a woman's dress; but this time I saw the skirt of a black gown disappearing. It was not a servant's dress, for the sound was the sound of silk. Nevertheless, it was the black man Jacko who skulked past me the next moment in the passage. As I walked on I found something white lying at my feet, just where the woman had flitted past. I picked it up; it was a lady's pocket-handker- chief, pure and fine. I thrust it into my bosom, and did not examine it, though it was some time before I returned to the drawing-room. Re-entering, there I beheld Lady Fitzgibbon playing chess with my uncle. She was dressed in the glittering maize-colored silk which I mentioned before: a dress she was fond of. I looked alround for Peg; she was not there, but entered the room a few minutes after, looking pale, I thought. In she came, in her everlasting black gown. I never had felt revolted at its monotonous reappearance before. A sickening chill crept over me as I glanced away from her, and- looked scrutinizingly all round the room. Not a lady of the com- pany was dressed in black, save and excepting Peg O'Shaughnessy. Howthe evening wore out, I do not know. I examined that hand- kerchief before I went to bed, and found, delicately embroidered in one corner, the O'Shaughnessy crest. I need not detail to you, Tom, how, after this, my days were bit- ter and my nights sleepless, -- in how many ways I strove to account for what had come under my notice, - and how, in accounting for it whatever way I might, I only made myself more miserable. There was no solution for the mystery, and I wretchedly gave it up. Christmas eve arrived, and a wild day it was. The wind bullied at the windows, and the snow-drifts kept blinding up the panes. It was while we were hanging up the mnistletoe, that Lady Fitzgibbon invited -us all to a fancy ball at Kilbanagher Park, on that day three weeks. It was to be given in honor of Uncle Giles with whom she   7- 1*^ F     LITTLE PEG O'SHAUQBE-SSY.-       13- 1Y- was now first favorite, who was going on a visit to her house, and who vowed he would appear at her ball in the character of a Lap- lander, dressed in furs. - The invitation made a pleasant little sen- sation, and costumes and characters were discussed during the rest of the day. Every one was pleased but Gorman Tracey, who was now as jealous of Giles Humphrey as he had formerly been of-me. Where was Peg that day, and had she, too, been invited? I did not know. I fancied she had shunned me ever since that evening. And now, Tom, I am coming to the bad, black page in my histo- ry. The snow-storm raged that night until one in the morning, banging at the windows, howling down the chimneys, and making the floors swing, till one felt as if lying in the cabin of a ship. I believe no one slept in the beginning of the night, but towards two in the morning the storm lulled, and the whole house was wrapped in the deep slumber that follows a tiresome waking and longing for sleep. The calming of the wind did not, unfortunately, remove the cause of my restlessness, and my eyes remained open, and my- mind full of painful thoughts, long after the rearing had grown faint in the chimneys, and the cannonading at my window had ceased. I had despaired of sleep at last, had arisen, and roused my fire brightened my lamp and prepared to read, when I heard a noise in the corridor. Not a great noise, but a very little noise; not a noise of one walking or talking, not a sound of a door opening, nor of anything falling; not a noise that I could in any way at all describe; only just an imperceptible warning that something was alive and stirring not far away. The time had been when such a little thing would not have been worth my notice; but circumstances had of late made me painfully watchful and suspicious. I was eager to grasp at any shadow which seemed to promise a clew to the mystery over which I pon- dered night and day. I sprang to my door, and opened it. The room which I had appropriated to myself when I gave up my own to my uncle was one of those which opened off that corri- dor, at the end of which was Giles Humphrey's chamber. All was solemnly hushed when I opened the door; the folrm of every win-  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6538-00000073"/> -40        )-GOOD STORIES. dow printed in bright moonlight on the floor, with long shladows lying between. I looked up the corridor, and then down, in time to see a woman's figure, wrapped from head to foot in a loose dalk gown, passing swiftly -through one of the moonlit spaces into a shadow; then out of the shadow again into another pale green nimbus. A few hasty strides brought me to the spot where she had passed a moment before; but she had turned the corner into that other passaoe which led away to the staircase. I followed, but the figure had vanished; and only the faintest sound of a door shutting softly fell on my ear. I returned to my chamber; more wretched, more indignant, and more puzzled than I had left it.  Christmas morning broke gloriously, Zwith a red sun looking gor geously through the snowy branches of the trees, and found me with a rackin headache, eyes that felt as if they were parboiled, and a heart like a lump of lead. While I dressed, I saw from my window Lady Fitzgibbon tripping away down the avenue, in her fur mantle and velvet hat, to the earliest service at our little country church. I also turned out of doors, seeking to get braced by the frosty air. The thanksgiving was very vague in my heart as I walked up and down, and I noticed with indifference the wintry splendor of the morning. lMy thoughts were full of that mysterious fi gure that had morning rf 1U1 of that mys      e, tihat bad r flitted down the corridor in the moonlight. I was thinkina of her height, which was about the height of at least half a dozen women in the house, of her gown, hich was a loose dressing-grown affair which anybody might wear, and of the room into which she escaped, which must have been one of two rooms standingly opposite one another on the lower corridor near the staircase. These were the things I thought about, growing no happier, till it was time to go in to breakfast. But the wonders were only beginning. In the hall I met two or three people with faces aghast, two or three people open-mouthed with astonishing news, and in the midst of them Jacko, gesticulating and gibbering frightfully. The servants were running about excit- edly, the guests in the breakfast-parlor were talking eagerly, while Giles Humphrey was rushing up and down the room like a madman' .          ..   "TTLE   PEG -OSETAUGHNE SSY.     t4f  his face green with passion, his eyes rolling about, his hair pushed .  tip on end, and various signs of disorder about his dress. One min  ute he was calling down the vengeance of Heaven on some person  i unknown, the next he was wringing his hands and whimpering like a whipped school-boy. I soon learned what was the matter.     h Giles Humphrey's strong-box had been rifled during the night.  Ten thousand pounds in money had been stolen; also jewels to the  I value of a fabulous amount.                    A- I heard, and a ghastly light was thrown upon my puzzle. There - came a hissing in my ears, and flames darted past my eyes. , For  If the first time in my life, it seemed possible to me that I, a strong  man, could swoon. I looked at Peg, who was sittinag in a corner of i the bay-window, with her pale, pretty face leaned forward on her  hand, the stray little wavelets of her hair almost dipping into the  large, gray eyes. The usual proud reserve of her mouth and brows had given way to an expression of strong interest in the startling topic of the moment. My uncle had commenced shrieking at me     the moment I appeared.  "Nephew I " he cried, grasping wildly at my coat, and screaming - into my ear, " send instantly for a detachment of police, and have  all your rascally servants taken into custody. Send-"  i    X  But I will not trouble you,- Tom, with the repetition of his rav- ings. It seemed the general opinion that the robbery had been committed by some one in the house. - True, a window had been found open on the ground-floor at the back; but this was easily dis- covered to be a ruse, as the thief had made a serious mistake, by opening a window which was closely barred outside. Some one in the house had penetrated the secrets of the springs and locks of Giles Humphrey's strong-box. One or two persons had the hardi- hood to suggest Jacko as the robber, but to any suspicion of him his master would not listen. Jacko had been his servant for years  upon years, and had never defrauded him of a baubee. Why  should he turn traitor now? Why? Because perhaps he never before had been tempted by  the art of a clever woman. I should have said to Giles Hunphrey,  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6538-00000074"/> "2         GOOD STORIES. "There is a plot, and I believe your man Jacko to be concerned in it," only for that handkerchief I had found upon the passage, and only for the flutter of that black silk dress. Again I looked at Peg. Still that same eager, interested look so becoming to the pale pretty face; still the sweetly moulded chin reposing on the white guilty (?) hand. I made an effort to summon my presence of mind, and act reason-- ably. I despatched a messenger for the police. I promised my uncle that every endeavor should be made to regain his property. Breakfast was upon the table, and I begged my guests to be seated, and to defer the further discussion of the unpleasant event until af- ter the meal had been partaken of. The first part of my bidding they obeyed, but not the second. I had not indeed expected they would so -easily waive the subject. Why, such an adventure to talk about on a Christmas morning, in a country-house .barricaded with snow, was a perfect godsend. So busy were they with the subject, that they had forgotten to miss my Lady Fitzgibbon, who presently arrived in the cosiest of cashmere morning-dresses, and with quite a bloom -in her cheeks from her early walk. She came in so gayly, that it was evident that she had as yet learned nothing of what had happened. Hardly had she taken her seat at the table, when a lady by her side commenced rapidly, "Have you heard-?" "I have heard nothing!" she answered lightly, "but I shall be delighted to hear anything, for I am dying for news. But first," she added, suddenly recollecting herself,- -" first I must perform an act of justice. Miss O'Shaughnessy," she said, putting her hand in her pocket, and drawing something forth, "I beg your pardon. for. playing a little trick upon you. I found this lying humbly at your door this morning; a pretty Christmas-box, placed there, no doubt" (with an arch smile at Giles Humphrey) "by that amiable Santa Klaus who comes to good children on Christmas eve.

But, you see, going to church does one some service, since I have come home repentant, and determined to make restitution." And she laughingly laid beside Peg's plate the identical splendid bracelet which we had all admired on a plump white arm one night, and which I bade you remember, Tom. Peg's face and throat became crimson, and she hastily pushed the. trinket from her, saying hoarsely, "It is not mine, Lady Fitz- gibbon." "But, my love, I tell you I found it lying at your door." At the appearance of the bracelet every one had ceased speaking, and, after Lady Fitzgibbon's repeated assertion that she had found it at Peg's door, the room grew as hushed as a grave. My lady her- self looked round the' table as if she was asking, "What is this?"?  and then the person by her side bent and whispered in her ear. The gay brunette face was suddenly overcast, and Lady Fitzgibbon  looked shocked. I think it was the heavy ominous silence, lasting so long that it l began to hiss in one's ears, which made Petg lift her eyes at last. ! She looked first at the bracelet lying before her on the table, then ! all round the many silent faces of the company, with a fearful, hesi- -  tating look., Evelry eye was upon her, furtively or openly, and in j all she read the saime suspicion of herself.

She sat so, till breakfast was hastily finished, and the people all slipped one by one out of the room, and left her sitting there alone.

The snow came on heavily after breakfast, and furnished an excuse for every one's remaining within doors until after the arrival and departure of the police. As soon as I could do so, I returned to the breakfast-room; but Peg had disappeared, and I turned out of the window, and walked up and down a covered alley of the garden, trying in solitude to collect my thoughts, and resolve upon what steps I should take to save Peg from the degrading consequences of her rash crime. Tracey found me there, and we talked the matter over together. "I see how it is with you, old fellow," he said, grasping my hand; "I have seen it for some time, and I am sorry for you from the bottom of my heart. Poor Peg, how she has ruined herself! That biting poverty has been too many for her. For Heaven's sake, Humphrey, don't look so deathly, or people will know all about it at a glance. What are you going to do for her?" "I don't know," I said; "I must think of some means to keep her from destruction. Of course, after tfis, I can never see her again; but I will save her, at all costs, from disgraceful punish- ment." We talked some time, and then went into the house; just too late to make any effort to prevent a painful scene, Two policemen had arrived, and Giles Humphrey had marched them straight up to Peg O'Shaughnessy's chamber door. It was wonderful hlow many people happened to be about on the stairs, and in the passacges, when this little event occurred. The door of the room had just opened to the rude summons, when Tracey and I reached the spot, and Peg stood at bay in the doorway, her slim figure drawn up, her eyes flashing, and two red spots burning on her cheeks. "What do you want?" she asked of the men, who stood humbly before her, looking ashamed of themselves. "Please, miss," said one, "we have orders to search this room, and we must do our duty." "Do you permit this?" said Peg, turning haughtily to Giles Humphrey, who growled and swore that he had been villanously robbedand would make every effort to regain what he had lost. ,By Heavens, the men should search!    "TTZLE PEG o'SHAUGWJESS     ;-i "Then," said Peg, closing the door behind her, and throwing herself against it, while 'she still held the handle, "all I have to say is, that I will not tolerate this insult. I dare you to enter this room." Hereupon one of the men, obeying a gesture from Giles Hum- phrey;, was preparing to disengage her fingers from the- handle of the door, when I stepped forward and checked him. "This lady is my guest," I said, " and I cannot allow her privacy to be intruded upon without her consent. There is some mistake here, my men, and, while we try and discover it, you had better go down stairs and have something to drink." The poor fellows, who had evidently disliked their task very much, needed no second bidding, but disappeared at once; while I hooked Giles Humphrey's arm within my own, and led him away to the fireside in my own apartment. "Now I tell you what it is," I said: ",make no more fuss about this affiair, and I will .pay you down the ten thousand pounds you have lost in my house."  He stared at me, as if to see whether I were in earnest or not. "You are mad," said he. "Perhaps I am," I said, " and perhaps I am not; but my money is good all the same. Send'these men off, let the thing be hushed up, and I will write you a check before dinner-time." He pondered, and screwed up his hard mouth. "But the jewels?" he said. "What were they?"I asked. "There was the fellow of that bracelet, (confound the greedy jade and her pretty face!) there was a diamond necklace, and a fine chain of pearls - " "Well, well!" said I, "you will never recover these, do what you will. Far your better chance is to take my offer." "Why should I not find if I searched?" he cried, starting up.

It was generally understood that the matter was hushed up, and that people were expected to believe, or to seem as if they believed, that a burglar had done the mysterious deed. Many efforts were essayed to make the day pass off as if nothing had happened. Peg reappeared in the drawing-room, as if scorning to lie by like one in disgrace. But I need not tell you, Tom, of the sudden silences and strange looks which greeted her wherever she moved. She was the theme of low-voiced conversation in every mouth; her poverty and hardships, her want of a mother, her pride, her coveting of things beyond her reach. Different people took different views of her case. And low-voiced as the talk was, she knew all about it. Guilty as she might be, I could see that the girl's heart was crush- ing within her. That night I cried like a child upon rIy pillow, the first tears I had shed since the beard grew on my chin. If tears, ay, or even blood, could wash Peg clean!"My God!"I groaned, "I have done what I can for her. Why does she not go home?" The next morning I came upon her by accident standing alone in the library, looking over the edges of a book into the fire. "Mr. Humphrey," she said, in a painful, unnatural voice, "C you will wonder, I dare say, why I do not leave your house at once. I am waiting only in hopes that this mystery will be cleared up." One of those crimson blushes of hers passed over her face as she spoke. The proud, sorrowful look in her eyes almost unmanned me. I had a sickening struggle with my heart, which had set its affections on a face that looked so true. I loved this woman, but I could not marry a-: even my thoughts would not frapae the word. But I steeled myself to make her a truthful answer. "Miss O'Shaughnessy," I said, " the mystery has been hushed up. Whether it ever can be cleared up, you, I believe, must know bet- ter than I." Then I turnjed away from her, feeling like one who las given himself a mortal wound. A little piteous wail of agony reached   "TTLE PEG O'SHA UGHNESSY.        147 me as I passed the door;, that lived in my memory many a year after. That very hour she left Ballyhuckamore on foot, without giving notice to any one; and toiled back through the snow to the dreari- ness of Castle Shaughnessy, bringing with her disgrace to add to the other miseries of her home. Tom, Tom! are there any of men's sins that can never be forgiven them? As soon as I decently could, I got rid of my guests, consigned Ballyhuckamore Hall to the care of Mrs. Daly, and went abroad. Giles Humphrey then took up his quarters at Kilbanagher Park, and Gorman Tracey also left me to pay a visit to the charming Lady Fitzgibbon. Erelong, Tracey wrote me that he had proposed to the lovely widow, and had been rejected. A year afterwards, I saw by accident, in an English paper, the announcement of her mar- riage with Giles Humphrey. For five long years I remained abroad. I need not entertain you, Tom, with an account of my wanderings; we have talked them over together often enough. The sixth April had come round again when I found myself on a rainy evening walking once more through the London streets. The sight of the old familiar places naturally made me meditative, and my thoughts were busy with the past. I was wondering how it was that I had never got over that shock that Peg had given me, and congratulating myself on being so well fitted by my wandering habits for a life of old-bachelorhood. It was the first night of my arrival in England, and I had preferred to, take a solitary walk, before hunting up any of my old friends. I was passing round one of the West-End squares, when my pro- gress on the pavement was arrested by one of those little commo- tions which take place when a lady is about to descend from her carriage in full ball costume, and float up the steps of a house where an entertainment is being given. -The windows of the house blazed, and the hall door stood open. A little crowd had gathered, and I stopped perforce to view the spectacle with the rest. The lady in this, case was dressed with superlative splendor, and the light from  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6538-00000077"/> the hall above fell full on her face. With a curious start I recog  nized Lucretia Fitzgibbon. There was no mistake about it. I heard from the coachman that the carriage belonged to my Lady Humphrey, and I also learned from him his master's address. I know not why it could have been that I felt at that moment a desire to go and see Giles Humphrey. There were others in town whom I had a longing to see, and I never liked either him or his wife. But it is impossible to look back upon one's actions in this way. Certain it is that I went. I found him in a splendidly appointed house, in a fashionable neighborhood, a shrivelled, palsied old man, an invalid chained to a- seat by his dressing-room fire, while his gay wife fluttered abroad, and scattered the money he had hoarded so grimly. The poor wretch was glad to see me. When I had talked to him awhile,'I found that there was not a pauper in the streets more utterly friend- less than he. - He spent his days in a handsome jail, and my lady was as flinty-hearted a keeper as ever turned key on a felon. Sitting over his fire, with a lamp shaded to so dim a light that we scarcely could see one another's face, while the carriages rolled past under the windows, and echoes of thundering knocks at gay hall doors reached us, he told me the secrets of his life since we last had met. I think it was because I saw death plainly written in his misera- ble face, that I listened so tolerantly to his whimpering complaints of Lady Humphrey. Her ill-treatment of him, which he cursed so bitterly, dated back to the day after their marriage, when he had  discovered that, instead of allying himself with enormous wealth, he had married a penniless adventuress, who was deep in a very slough of debt, and existing upon the brink of exposure and ruin. Never had there been a day of domestic peace between them. She had treated him like a prisoner from the first, taken possession of his money and his keys, and even corrupted faithful Jacko, whom  she had pressed into her service. She spent a gay life abroad, while he, poor creature, could hardly crawl across his chamber 1 alone. He was savagely jealous of the people amongst whom she  *,.   J111 v-rC rjjr  H U6AG HNESSY.      149- spent her time, the friends and admirers who lounged about the drawing-room; the letters and presents she received tormented him. There was a certain casket, it seemed, which at times she paraded before his eyes, but of which he had never seen the key. And the poor wretch, brooding in his solitude, panted for a view oi the inte- rior of that casket, as though his very life depended upon what it might contain. I sat with him late that night; I promised to come back and see him again, and I did so, always at night, and invariably finding Lucretia from home. In truth, I did not want to see her. The more I heard of her doings, the more horribly strong grew a doubt which had risen within me on the night of my first conversation with Giles Humphrey. It clung to me night and day, and so nearly did it approach conviction at times, that it had like to drive me insane. I ventured to say to my uncle one evening, - "Could it have been possible that it was Lady Fitzgibbon who committed the robbery at Ballyhuckamore on that memorable Christmas eve ? " But he stared at me in amazement, and said, stupidly:- " Why, don't you remember, it was the little O'Shaughnessy who did that piece of business?  She told on herself, by dropping a bracelet on the step of her door.  Little good her ill-gotten gain- have done her, I hear, for the old father died wretchedly, the bar- rack of a castle is given up to the rats, and the wench herself is drifting about the world, the Devil knows where !" So it was no use talking in this way to Giles Humphrey.  Yet I came to see him again and again, hanging about him in the vague hope that something might some day arise between him and his wife, which might chance to bring relief to my unhappy state of mind. How bitterly did I now regret that the matter of the rob- bery bad not been more closely investigated, at the time  that it occurred ! Vain regrets at the end of five weary years ! One evening I went to visit Giles Humphrey.  My lady was at the opera, the servant told me.  Going up stairs, I found my uncle, as usual, alone, but chuckling in ecstasies of fercious- delight. He- dangled a bunch of keys before my eyes.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6538-00000078"/> 150         GOOD- STORIES.           * "Hist, nephew!" he said, "I have got her keys! If she is cun- ning, I am cunning. If she has robbed me, I will rob her. Ha, ha, ha! Lend me your arm till I hobble to yonder closet of hers, and see what my lady keeps in her casket." I tried to prevent him, but I might as well have tried to hold fire in my hands. He would have crawled across the room on all fours if I had not assisted him. He found the casket, fitted it with a key, and opened it. The first thing that met my eyes was a bracelet that I knew too well. "This," said I, taking it up, " is the memorable bracelet that was found on the doorstep?" He took it from me, looking stupidly puzzled. "No," said he, "she had on that bracelet to-night. How is this?" "Stop!" cried I; "did you not tell me that a fellow of that bracelet had been stolen; also a chain of pearls?"I went on, diving farther into the recesses of the casket, and drawing out each trinket as I named it. "Also a diamond necklace! Giles Humphrey, how did these come into your wife's possession?" His jaw dropped, and he stared blankly before him. "By heavens, you are right," he mumbled. "Little O'Shaugh- nessy was wronged. My lady has been the traitor all through!" I cannot tell you what I thought, nor describe the mixture of ecstasy and agony that racked me for the next few moments. I was roused from my revery by a shriek from Giles Humphrey. He had found some letter for which, it seemed, he had been seeking, and he was foaming at the mouth. At the same moment that I heard his shriek, there was a sound in the adjoining chamber; immediately the door flew open, and Lady Humphrey herself appeared. It was the first time I had seen her face to face since the olden times. She was regally dressed, and handsomer than ever, but with a coarser, bolder beauty. She had just returned from the opera. So intensely interested had we been in our occupation, that we had not heard the stopping of the carriage, nor the knock at the hall   * LITTLE PEG, aSHAUGHNESSY.        151 door. What she might have said, or what she might have done, I know not, but the frown had not time to darken on her face, before her miserable husband staggered towards her, flung the crumpled letter which he held in her face, and fell down at her feet in a fit. I lifted him upon his bed, and, ringing loudly, despatched a mes- senger for a doctor. Then the wicked wife and I stood looking at one another across the dying man, whilst we chafed his hands, and did what we could to help him. Even at that moment I could not refrain from accusing her. She saw the jewels lying scattered on the floor, and was prepared for an attack. "Lady Humphrey," I said, in the name of Heaven, and in the presence of death, I conjure you to tell me truly if it was you who committed the robbery at Ballyhuckamore Hall five years ago." "Ay," said she, hardly, looking straight at me across the bed - "It was I who did it, certainly. If you had had the sense to ask me the question four years ago, after my marriage with him," indi- cating her prostrate husband, "I should have told you the truth as freely as I tell it to you now. I wanted money at that time, and I took it." "And threw the blame upon another?"I said. She shrugged her shoulders. "One must do something," she said. "It would have been inconvenient to me just then to have had it known." "But, in the name of Heaven," I said," explain. Was it you who conferred with Jacko in the passage? Then the black gown,- the pocket-handkerchief- ?" She lifted her eyebrows, and smiled in derision. "Fool!" she said. "As if one woman could not imitate another's dress for five minutes if it suited her purpose to do so. As if one woman could not pick up another's pocket-handkerchief, and drop it again, if she so fancied!" My story, Tom, is nearly ended now. It only remains for me to tell you how I sought for Peg and how I found her. For a whole year I searched in vain, discovering no clew to her whereabouts.  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6538-00000079"/> 152 .        GOOD STORIES. Castle Shaughnessy was deserted, and no one knew whether Sir Pierce's daughter was living or dead. The poor people round her old home cried when they spoke of her, but only knew she had gone "abroad." Information bitterly vague. "Abroad" might mean anywhere over the wide, wide world. The December of the year of my search I spent in Paris, wandering day and night through its open streets and hidden purlieus, seeking eagerly for a glimpse of that one face which my eyes yearned to behold. I had, somehow, got a fancy that in Paris I should find her; and in Paris I searched with unflagging energy, early and late, for three long, dreary weeks. At last, when I thought I was known in every street and alley, and knew every face I met off by heart, the hopeful spirit fell away within me, and I gave up the struggle in despair. Very sorrowful I was, Tom, walking along the streets on Christ- mas eve. Coming home to my hotel just at twilight, I saw the bright glow of a fire shining cheerily in one of the windows of a large old-fashioned house quite close to my destination. Trees surrounded this old house, and gave it an appearance of retirement, though the wind ,w of which I speak looked out upon the road. I wonder what it lwas that impelled me to cross over and read upon a brass plate by the lamp-light an announcement that this was an establishment for the education of "Jeunes demoi- selles "? I wonder what it was that impelled me afterwards to look in at that window, and see Peg sitting at the fire, in a cosey little room, all alone? She was staring very thoughtfully at the flames, as if looking at past Christmas eves between the bars. Of course Peg was a teacher in this school, and I had walked up and down before her door every miserable day for the past three weeks. Of course I knocked at the door, and startled her reveries by introdu- cing myself. Ay, there she was indeed, my very own little Peg, only paler and thinner, and sadder and sweeter-looking. You may imagine the rest, O Tom! knowing as you do that little 'Peg is Mrs. Humphrey. I did not deserve it, but I was forgiven. Giles Humphrey, you know, is dead, and his wife still contrives to live in splendor. She shuns us, and we shun her. When, dear Tom, shall we see you at Ballyhuckamore again?   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY. CHAPTER I. AT that remarkable period when Louis XVIII. was restored a second time to the throne of his fathers, and all the English who had money or leisure rushed over to the Continent, there lived in a certain boarding-house at Brussels a genteel young widow, who bore the elegant name of Mrs. Wellesley Macarty. In the same house and room with the widow lived her mamma, a lady who was called Mrs. Crabb. Both professed to be rather fashionable people. The Crabbs were of a very old England stock, and the Macartys were, as the world knows, county Cork people; related to the Sheenys, Finnigans, Clancys, and other distinguished families in their part of Ireland. But Ensign Wellesley Mac, not having a shilling, ran off with Miss Crabb, Who possessed the same independence ; and after having been married about six months to the lady, was carried off suddenly, on the 18th of June, 1815, by a dis- ease very prevalent in those glorious times, - the fatal cannon-shot morbus. He, and many hundred young fellows of his regiment, the Clonakilty Fencibles, were attacked by this epidemic on the same day, at a  place about ten miles from Brussels, and there perished. The Ensign's lady  had accompanied her husband to the Continent, and about five months after his death brought into the world two remarkably fine female children. Mrs. Wellesley's mother had been reconciled to her daughter by this time, - for, in truth, Mrs. Crabb had no other child but her runaway Juliana, to whom she flew when she heard of her destitute  ! condition. And, indeed, it was high time that some one should come to the young widow's aid; for as her husband did not leave    a money, nor anything that represented money, except a number of    i ' '                 ' ,  J  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6538-00000080"/> 154/         GOOD STORIES. tailors' and boot-makers' bills, neatly docketed in his writing-desk, Mrs. Wellesley was in danger of starvation, should no friendly per- son assist her. Mrs. Crabb, then, came off to her daughter, whom the Sheenys, Finnegans, and Clancys refused, with one scornful voice, to assist. The fact is, that Mr. Crabb had once been butler to a lord, and his lady a lady's maid; and at Crabb's death Mrs. Crabb disposed of the Ram hotel and posting-house, where her husband had made three thousand pounds, and was living in genteel ease in a country town, when Ensign Macarty came, saw, and run away with Juliana. Of such a connection it was impossible that the great Clancys and Finnegans could take notice; and so once more Widow Crabb was compelled to share with her daughter her small income of a hundred and twenty a year. Upon this, at a boarding-house in Brussels, the two managed to live pretty smartly, and to maintain an honorable reputation. The twins were put out, after the foreign fashion, to nurse, at a village in the neighborhood; for Mrs. Macarty had been too ill to nurse them;, and Mrs. Crabb could not afford to purchase that most expen- sive article, a private wet-nurse. There had been numberless tiffs and quarrels between mother and daughter, when the latter was in her maiden state; and Mrs. Crabb was, to tell the truth, in no wise sorry when her Jooly disappeared with the Ensign, - for the old lady dearly loved a gentleman, and was not a little flattered at being the mother to Mrs. Ensign Macarty. Why the Ensign should have run away with his lady at all, as he might have had her for the asking, is no business of ours; nor are we going to rake up old stories- and village scandals which insinuate that Miss Crabb ran away with hint, for with these points the writer and the reader have nothing to do. Well, then, the reconciled mother and daughter lived once more together, at Brussels. In the course of a year Mrs. Macarty's sorrow had much abated; and having a great natural love of dress, and a tolerably handsome face and person, she was induced, without much reluctance, to throw her weeds aside, and to appear in the Of-T   A SHABBY GENNTEEL STORY.         1W5 most becoming and varied costumes which her means and, ingenuity could furnish. Considering, indeed, the smallness of the former, it was agreed on all hands that Mrs. Crabb and her daughter deserved wonderful credit, - that is, they managed to keep up as respectable an appearance as if they had five hundred a year; and at church, at tea-parties, and abroad in the streets, to be what is called quite the gentlewomen. If they starved at home, nobody saw it; if they patched and pieced, nobody (it was to be hoped) knew it; if they bragged about their relations and property, could any one say them nay? Thus they lived, hanging on with desperate energy to the skirts of genteel society; Mrs. Crabb, a sharp woman, rather respected her daughter's superior iank; and Mrs. Macarty did not quarrel so much as heretofore with her mamma, on whom herself and her two children were entirely dependent. While affairs were at this juncture, it happened that a young Englishman, James Gann, Esq., of the great oil-house of Gann, Blubbery, and Gann (as he took care to tell you before you had been an hour in his company),-- it happened, I say, that James Gann, Esq., came to Brussels for a month, for the purpose of per- fecting himself in the French language; and while in that capital, went to lodge at the very boarding-house which contained Mrs. Crabb and her daughter. Gann was young, weak, inflammable; he saw and adored Mrs. Wellesley Macar'ty; and she, who was at this period all but engaged to a stout, old wooden-legged Scotch regimental surgeon, pitilessly sent Dr. M'Lint about his business, and accepted the addresses of Mr. Gann. How the young man arranged matters with his papa, the senior partner, I don't know; but it is certain that there was a quarrel, and afterwards a reconcilia- tion; and it is also known that James Gann fought a duel with the surgeon, -receiving the .E4 sculapian fire, and discharging his own bullet into the azure skies. About nine thousand times, in the course of his after-years, did Mr. Gann narrate- the history of the combat; it enabled him to go through life with the reputation of a man of courage, and won for him, as he said with pride, the hand of his Juliana; perhaps this was rather a questionable benefit.-  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6538-00000081"/> One part of the tale, however, honest James never did dare to tell, except when peculiarly excited by wrath or liquor; it was this, that on the day after the wedding, and in the presence of many friends who had come to offer their congratulations, a stout nurse, bearing a brace of chubby little ones, made her appearance; and- these rosy urchins. springing forward at the sight of Mr. James Gann, shouted affectionately, "Miaman! Alaman!" at which the lady, blushing rosy red, said, "James, these two are yours "; and poor James wellnigh fainted at this sudden paternity so put upon him. "Children!" screamed he, aghast; "whose children?" at which Mrs. Crabb, majestically checking him, said: "These, my dear James, are the daughters of the gallant and good Ensign Macarty, whose widow you yesterday led to the altar. May you be happy with her, and may these blessed children (tears) find in you a father who shall replace him that fell in the field of glory \" Mrs. Crabb, Mrs. James Gann, Mrs. Major Lolly, Mrs. Piffler, and several ladies present, set up a sob immediately; and James Gann, a good-humored, soft-hearted man, was quite taken aback. Kissing his lady hurriedly, he vowed that he would take care of the poor little things, and proposed to kiss them likewise ; which caress the darlings refused with many roars. Gann's fate awas sealed froin that minute; and he was properly henpecked by his wife and mother-in-law during the life of the latter. Indeed, it was to Mrs. Crabb that the stratagem of the infant concealment was due; for when her daughter innocently proposed to have or to see the chil- dren, the old lady strongly pointed out the folly of such an arrange- ment, which might, perhaps, frighten away Mr. Gann from the delightful matrimonial trap into which ducky rogue!) he was about to fall. Soon after the marriage the happy pair returned to England, oc- cupying the house in Thames Street, city, until the death of Gann, senior; when his son, becoming head of the firm of Gann and Blub- bery, quitted the dismal precincts of Billingsgate and colonized in the neighborhood of Putney; where a neat box, a couple of spare bed- rooms, a good cellar, and a smart gig to drive into and out from   town, made a real gentleman of him. Mrs. Gann treated him With much scorn, to be sure, called him a sot, and abused hugely the male companions that he brought down with him to Putney. Hon- est James would listen meekly, would yield, and would bring down a brace more friends the next day, with whom he would discuss his accustomed number of bottles of port. About this period a daughter was born to-him, called Caroline Brandenburgh Gann; so named after a large mansion near Hammersmith, and an injured queen who lived there at the time of the little girl's birth, and who was greatly compassioned and patronized by Mrs. James Gann, and other ladies of distinction. Mrs. James was a lady in those days, and gave evening parties of the very first order. At this period of time Mrs. James Gann sent the twins, Rosalind Clancy and Isabella Finnigan Wellesley Macarty, to a boarding- school for young ladies, and grumbled much at the amount of the half-year's bill which her husband was called upon to pay for them; for though James discharged them with perfect good-humor, his lady began to entertain a mean opinion indeed of her pretty young children. They could expect no fortune, she said, from Mr. Gann, and she wondered that he should think of brinoing them up expen- sively, when he had a darling child of his own, for whom he was bound to save all the money that he could lay by. 'Grandmamma, too, doted on the little Caroline Brandenburgh, and vowed that she would leave her three thousand pounds to this dear infant; for in this way does the world show its respect for that most respectable thing, prosperity. Who in this life get the smiles, and the acts of friendship, and the pleasing legacies? The rich. And I do, for my part, heartily wish that some one would leave me a trifle,-say twenty thousand pounds, -being perfectly confident that some one else would leave me more; and that I should sink into my grave worth a plum at least. Little Caroline then had her maid, her airy nursery, her little carriage to drive in, the promise of her grandmamma's consols, and that priceless treasure, her mamma's undivided affection. Gann, too, loved her sincerely, in his careless, good-humored way; but he .. .-   - .

Gann and Blubbery were in the oil line, - have we not said so? Their profits arose from contracts for lighting a great number of streets in London; and about this period GAS came into use. Gann and Blubbery appeared in the c"Gazette "; and, I am sorry to say, so bad had been the management of Blubbery, - so great the ex- travagance of both partners and their ladies, - that they only paid their creditors fourteen pence halfpenny in the pound. When Mrs. Crabb heard of this dreadful accident, - Mrs. Crabb, who dined thrice a week with her son-in-law; who never would have been allowed to enter"the house at- all had not honest James interposed his good-nature between her quarrelsome daughter and herself,-Mrs. Crabb, I say, proclaimed James Gann to be a swindler, a villain, a disreputable, tipsy, vulgar man, and made over her money to the Misses Rosalind Clancy and Isabella Sheeny Macarty; leaving poor little Caroline without one single maravedi, Half of one thousand five hundred pounds allotted to each was to be paid at marriage, the other half on the death of Mrs. James Gann, who was to enjoy the interest thereof. Thus do we rise and fall in this world, - thus does Fortune shake her swift wings, and bid us abruptly to resign the gifts (or rather loans) which we have had from her. How Gann and his family lived after their stroke of misfortune I know not; but as the failing tradesman is going through the pro- cess of bankruptcy, and for some months afterwards, it may be remarked, that he has usually some mysterious means of subsistence, -stray spars of the wreck of his property, on which he manages to seize, and to float for a while. During his retirement, in an obscure lodging in Lambeth, where the poor fellow was so tormented by his wife as to be compelled to fly to the public-house for refuge, Mrs. Crabb died; a hundred a year thus came into the possession of Mrs. Gann; and some of James's friends, who thought him a good fellow in his prosperity, came forward, and furnished a' house, in which they placed him, and came to see and comfort him. Then they came   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          159 to see him not quite so often; then they found out that Mrs. Gann was a sad tyrant, and a silly woman; then the ladies declared her to be insupportable, and Gann to be a low, tipsy fellow: and the gentlemen could but shake their heads, and admit that the charge was true. Then they left off coming to see him altogether; for such is the way of the world, where many of us have good impulses, and are generous on an occasion, but are wearied by perpetual want, and begin to grow angry at its importunities, - being very properly vexed at the daily recurrence of hunger, and the impudent unreason- ableness of starvation. Gann, then, had a genteel wife and children, a furnished house, and a hundred pounds a year. How should he live? The wife of James Gann, Esq., would never allow him to demean himself by taking a clerk's place; and James himself, being as idle a fellow as ever was known, was fain to acquiesce in this determination of hers, and to wait for some more genteel employ- ment. And a curious list of such genteel employments might be made out, were one inclined to follow this interesting subject far; shabby compromises with the world, into which poor fellows enter, and still fondly talk of their "position," and strive to imagine that they are really working for their bread. Numberless lodging-houses are kept by the females of families who have met with reverses: are not "boarding-houses, with a select musical society, in the neighborhood of the squares," main- tained by such? Do not the gentlemen of the boarding-houses issue forth every morning to the city, or make believe to go thither, on some mysterious business which they have? After a certain period, Mrs. James Gann kept a lodging-house (in her own words, received (" two inmates into her family "), and Mr. Gann had his mysterious business. In the year 1835, when this story begins, there stood in a certain back street in the town of Margate a house, on the door of which might be read in gleaming brass the name of Mr. GANN. It was the work of a single smutty servant-maid to clean this brass plate every morning, and to attend as far as possible to the wants of Mr. Gann, his family, and lodgers; and his house being not very far  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6538-00000083"/> from the sea, and as you might, by climbing up to the roof, get a sight, between two chimneys, of that multitudinous element, Mrs. Gann set down her lodgings as fashionable; and declared on her cards that her house commanded "a fine view of the sea." On the wire window-blind of the parlor was written, in large characters, the word OFFICE ; and here it was that Gann's services came into play. He was very much changed, poor fellow! and humbled; and, from two cards that hung outside the blind, I am led to believe that he did not disdain to be agent to the 1 London and Jamaica Ginger-Beer Company," and also for a certain preparation called "Gaster's Infants' Farinacio, or Mothers' Invigorating Sub- stitute," -a damp, black, mouldy, half-pound packet of which stood in permanence at one end of the " office " mantel-piece; while a Rfy- blown ginger-beer bottle occupied the other extremity.  Nothing else indicated that this ground-floor chamber was an office, except a huge black inkstand, in which stood a stumpy pen, richly crusted with ink at the nib, and to all appearance for many months enjoy- ing a sinecure. To this room you saw every day, at two o'clock, the employe from the neighboring hotel bring two quarts of beer; and if you called at that hour, a tremendous smoke, and smell of dinner, would gush out upon you from the " office," as you stumbled over sundry battered tin dish-covers, which lay gaping at the threshold. Thus had that great bulwark of gentility, the dining at six o'clock, been broken in; and the reader must therefore judge that the house of Gann was in a demoralized state.    ' Gann certainly was. After the ladies had retired to the back parlor (which, with yellow gauze round the frames, window- curtains, a red silk cabinet-piano, and an album, was still tolerably genteeD, Gann remained, to transact business in the office. This took place in the presence of friends, and usually consisted in the production of a bottle of gin from the corner-cupboard, or, mayhap, a litre of brandy, which was given by Gann with a knowing wink, and a fat finger placed on a twinkling red nose: when Mrs. G. was out, James would also produce a number of pipes, that gave this room a constant and agreeable odor of shag tobacco. : . .r                  .-    In fact, Mr. Gann had nothing to do from morning till night. He was now a fat, bald-headed man, of fifty; a dirty dandy on week-days, with a shawl waistcoat, a tuft of hair to his great double chin, a snuffy slirt-fiill, and enormous breast-pin- and seals: he had a pilot-coat, with large mother-of-pearl buttons, and always wore a great rattling telescope, with which he might be seen for hours on the sea-shore or the pier, examining the ships, the bathing-machines, the ladies' schools as they paraded up and down the esplanade, and all other objects which the telescopic view might give him. He knew every person connected with every one of the Deal and Dover coaches, and was sure to be witness to the arrival or depart-. ure of several of them in the course of the day; he had a word for the hostler about "that gray mare," a nod for the "shooter" or guard, and a. bowutor the dragsman; he could send parcels for nothing ups to town; had twice had Sir Rumble Tumble (the noble driver of the Flash-o'-lightnin g-light-four-inside-post-coach) i' up at his place," and took care to tell you that some of the party were pretty considerably "' sewn up," too. He did not frequent the large hotels; but in revenge he knew every person who entered or left them; and was a great man at the Bag of Nails, and the Magpie and Punchbowl, where he was president of a club he took the bass in "Mynheer Van Dunk," "The Wolf," and many other morsels of concerted song, and used to go backwards and forwards to London in the steamers as often as ever he liked, and have his "'grub," too, on board. Such was James Gann. Many people, when they wrote to him addressed him, James Gann, Esq. His reverses and former splendors afforded a never-failing theme of conversation to honest Gann and the whole of his family; and it may be remarked that such pecuniary misfortunes, as they are called, are by no means misfortunes to people of certain disposi- tions, but actual pieces of good luck. -Gann, for' instance, used to drink liberally of port and claret, when the house of Gann and Blubbery was in existence, and was'henceforth compelled to imbibe only brandy and gin. Now he loved these a thousand times more than the wine; and had the advantage of talking about the latter, No. 4.    .

In those prosperous days, too, being a gentleman, he could not firequent the public-house as he did at present; and the sanded tavern-parlor was Gann's supreme enjoyment. He was obliged to spend many hours daily in a dark unsavory room in an alley pff Thames Street; and Gann hated books and business, except of other peoples. His tastes were low; he loved public-house jokes and company; and now, being fallen was voted at the Bag of Nails and the Magpie before mentioned a tip-top fellow and real gentleman, whereas he had been considered an ordinalry vulgar man by his fashionable associates at Putney. Many men are there who are made to fall, and to profit by the tumble. As for Mrs. G., or Jooly as she was indifferently called by her husband, she, too, had gained by her losses. She bragged of her former acquaintances in the most extraordilnary way, and to hear her you would fancy that she was known and connected to half the peerage. Her chief occupation was talking medicine, and mending and altering of her gowns. She had a huge taste for cheap finery, loved raffles, tea-parties, and walks on the pier, where she flaunted herself and daughters as gcray as butterflies. She stood upon her rank, did not fail to tell her lodgers that she was a " gentlewoman," and was mighty sharp with Becky the maid, and poor Carey, her youngest child. For the tide of affection had turned now, and the "Misses Wel- lesley Macarty " were the darlings of their mother's heart, as Car- oline had been in the early days of Putney prosperity. Mrs. Gann respected and loved her elder daughters, the stately heiresses of fifteen hundred pounds, and scorned poor Caroline, who was like- wise scorned dike Cinderella in the sweetest of all stories) by her brace of haughty, thoughtless sisters. These young women were tall, well-grown, black-browed girls, little scrupulous, fond of fun, and having great health and spirits. Caroline was pale and thin, and had fair hair and meek gray eyes; nobody thought her a beauty, in her moping cotton gown; whereas the sisters, in flaunt- ing printed muslins, with pink scarfs, and artificial flowers, and    A SrHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          163 brassferronieres and other fallals, were voted very charming and genteel by the Ganns' circle of friends. They had pink cheeks, white shoulders, and many glossy curls stuck about their shining foreheads, as damp and as black as leeches. Such charms, madam, cannot fail of having their effect; and it was very lucky for Caro- line that she did not possess them, for she might hare been ren- dered as vain, frivolous, and vulgar as these young ladies were. While these enjoyed their pleasures and tea-parties abroad, it was Carry's usual fate to remain at home, and help the servant in the many duties which were required in Mrs. Gann's establishment. She dressed that lady and her sisters, brought her papa his tea in bed, kept the lodgers' bell, bore their scoldings, if they were ladies, and sometimes gave a hand in the kitchen if any extra pie-crust or cookery was required. At two she made a little toilet for dinner, and was employed on numberless household darnings and mendings in the long evenings, while her sisters giggled over the jingling piano, mamma sprawled on the sofa, and Gann was over his glass at the club. A weary lot, in sooth, was yours, poor little Caroline! since the days of your infancy not one hour of sunshine, no frien4- ship, no cheery play-fellows, no mother's love; but that being dead, the affections which would have crept round it withered and died -too. Only James Gann, of all the household, had a good-natured look for her, and a coarse word of kindness; nor, indeed, did Caro- line complain, nor shed many tears, nor call for death, as she would if she had been brought up in genteeler cilrcles. The poor thing did not know her own situation; her misery was dumb and patient; it is such as thousands and thousands of women in our society bear, and pine, and die of; made up of sums of small tyrannies, and long indifference, and bitter wearisome injustice, more dreadful to bear than any tortures that we of the stronger sex are pleased to cry Al! Al about. In our intercourse with the world (which is con- ducted with that kind of cordiality that we see in Sir Harry and my lady in a comedy, -a couple of painted, grinning fools, talking parts that they have learned out of a book); as we sit and look at the smiling actors, we get a glimpse behind the scenes, from time to I yriV .V4irrL"L -  r lr-r  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6538-00000085"/> 164         GOOD STORIES time, and alas for the wretched nature that appears there! - among women especially, who deceive even more than men, leaving more to hide, feeling more, living more than we who have our business, pleasure, ambition, which carries us abroad. Ours are the great strokes of misfortune, as they are called, and theirs the small miseries. While the male thinks, labors, and battles without, the domestic woes and wrongs are .the lot of the women; and the little ills are so bad, so infinitely fiercer and bitterer than the great, that I would not change my condition, - no, not to be Helen, Queen Elizabeth Mrs. Coutts, or the luckiest she in history. Well, then, in the manner we have described lived the Gann family. Mr. Gann all the better for his "misfortunes," Mrs. Gann little the worse the two young ladies greatly improved by the cir- cumstance, having been cast thereby into a society where their expected two thousand pounds made great heiresses of them; and poor Caroline, as luckless a being as any that the wide sun shone upon. Better to be alone in the world and utterly friendless, than to have sham friends and no sympathy; ties of kindred which bind one as it were to the corpse of relationship, and oblige one to bear through life the weight and the embraces of this lifeless, cold con- nection. I do not mean to say that Caroline would ever lhave made use of this metaphor, or suspected that her connection with her mamma and sisters was anything so loathsome. She felt that she was ill- treated, and had no companion; but was not on that account envious, only humble and depressed, not desiring so- much to resist as to bear injustice, and hardly venturing to think for herself. This tyranny and humility served her in place of education, and formed her manners, which were wonderfully gentle and calm. It was strange to see such a person growing up in such a family; the neighbors spoke of her with much scornful compassion. "A poor half-witted thing," they said, " who could not say bo to a goose ; and I think it is one good test of gentility to be thus looked down on by vulgar people.

An apothecary, too, had been smitten by her charms; but to live in a shop was beneath the dignity of a Wellesley Macarty, and she waited for better things.

Well, Isabella was not married; and the lieu tenant, a colonel in Spain, seemed to have given up all thoughts of her. She meanwhile consoled herself with a gay young wine-mer- chant, who had lately established himself at Brighton, kept a gig, rode out with the hounds, and was voted perfectly genteel; and there was a certain French marquess, with the most elegant black mustachios, Who had made a vast impression upon the heart of Rosalind, hav- ing met her first at the circulating library, and afterwards, by the most extraordinary series of chances, coming upon her and her sister daily in their walks upon the pier.

CHAPTER II. HOW MRS. GANN RECEIVED TWO LODGERS, IT was the winter season when the events recorded in this history occurred; and as at that period not one out of a thousand lodging- houses in Margate are let, Mrs. Gann, who generally submitted to occupy her own first and second floors duringr this cheerless season, considered herself more than ordinarily lucky when circumstances occurred which brought no less than two lodgers to her establish- ment. She had to thank her daughters for the first inmate; for, as these two young ladies were walking one day down their own street, talking of the joys of the last season, and the delight of the raffles and singing at the libraries, and the intoxicating pleasures of the Vauxhall balls, they were remarked and evidently admired by a young gentleman who was sauntering listlessly up the street. He stared, and it must be confessed that the fascinating girls stared too, and put each other's head into each others bonnet, and giggled and said, "Lor!" and then looked hard at the young gentle- man again. Their eyes were black, their cheeks were very red. Fancy how Miss Bella's and Miss Linda's hearts beat when the gen- tleman, dropping his glass out of his eye, actually stepped across the street, and said, "Ladies, I am seeking for lodgings, and should be glad to look at those which I see are to let in your house." "How did the conjurer know it was our house?" thoulht Bella and Linda (they always thought in couples),-from the very sim- ple fact that Miss Bella had just thrust into the door a latch-key. Most bitterly did Mrs. James Gann regret that she had not on her best gown when a stranger- a stranger in February - actu- ally called to look at the lodgings. She made up, however, for the slovenliness of her dress by the dignity of her demeanor; and asked the gentleman for references, informed him that she was a gentlewoman, and that he would have peculiar advantages in her i'   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.         167 establishment; and, finally, agreed to receive him at the rate of twenty shillings per week. The bright eyes of the young ladies had done the business, but to this day Mrs. James Gann is convinced that her peculiar dianity of manner, and great fluency of brag re- garding her family, have'been the means of bringing hundreds of lodgers to her house who but for her would never have visited it. L Gents," said Mr. James Gann at the Bag of Nails that very evening, " we have got a new lodger, and I'll1 stand glasses round to his jolly good health!" The new lodger, who was remarkable for nothing except very black eyes, a sallow face, and a habit of smoking cigars in bed until noon, gave his name George Brandon, Esq. As to his temper and habits, when humbly requested by Airs. Gann to pay in ad- vance, he laughed and presented her with a balnk-note, never quar- relied with a single item in her bills, wallkedl much, and ate two mutton-chops per diem. The young ladies, who examined all the boxes and letters of the lodgers, as young ladies will, could not find one single document relative to their new -inmate, except a tavern- bill of the Albion, to which the name of George Brandon, Esquire, was prefixed. Any other papers whichl might elucidate his history were locked up in a Bramah box, likewise marked G. B.; and though these were but unsatisfactory points by which to judge a man's character, there was a something about Mr. Brandon which caused all the ladies at Mrs. Gann's to vote he was quite a gentleman. When this was the case, I am happy to say it would not unfre- quently happen that Miss Rosalind or Miss Isabella would appear in the lodger's apartments, bearing in the breakfast-cloth, or blush- ingly appearing with the weekly bill, apologizing for mamma 's ab- sence, "and hoping that everytlhing was to the gentleman's liking.) Both the Misses Wellesley Macarty took occasion to visit Mr. Brandon in this manner, and he received both with such a fascinat- ing ease and gentleman-like freedom of manner, scanning their points from head to foot, and fixing his great black eyes so earnestly in their faces, that the blushing creatures turned away abashed, and yet pleased, and had many conversations about him. v':  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6538-00000087"/> i' Law, Bell, said Miss os3lind,' "what a chap that Brandon is!

"Well, dear, what?" said Mrs. Gann. "'Miss Bell,' says he, looking at me, and with such eyes I'll keep everything: the red wax, because it' s like your lips; the black ax, because it1's like your hair; and the satin paper, because it 's like your skin!' Was n't it genteel?" "Law, now!"exclaimed Mrs. Gann. "Upon my word, I think it's very rude!!" said Miss Lindy; and if he'd said so to me, Idl have slapped his face for his in- perence!" And much to her clc-it, Miss Lindy went to his rootn ten minutes after to- see if he wou2td say anything to her. What Mr. Brandon said, I never knew; but the little pang of envy which had caused Miss Lindy to retort sharply upoII her sister had given place to a pleased good-humor, and shle allowed Bella to talk about the new lodger as much as ever she liked.

Of the young gentleman who goes by the name of Brandon the ader of the above letter will not be so misguided, we tru-st, as to ve a very exalted opinion. The noble viscount read this doc- ent to a supper party in Christchurch, ill Oxford, and left it in a wl of milk-punch; whence a scout abstracted it, and handed it er to us. fiv lord was twenty years of a,e when he received the istle, and had spent a couple of yeals abroad, before going to the 'iversity, under the guardianship of the worthy individual who led himself George Brandon. Mr. Brandon was the son of a half-pay colonel, of good family, o, honoring the great himnself, thought hs son would vastly bene- by -an acquaintance with them, and selt him to Eton, at cruel rges upon a slender purse. From Etoni the lad went to Oxford,   took honors there, frequented the best society, followed with a kind of proud obsequiousness all the tufts of the University, and left it owing exactly two thousand pounds. Then there came storms at home; fury on the part of the stern old governor"; and final payment of the debt. But while this settlement was pending, lMas- ter George had contracted many more debts among bill-discounters, and was glad to fly to the Continent as tutor to young Lord Cinq- bars, in whose company he learned every one of the vices in Europe; and having a good natural genius, and a heart not unkilndly, had used these qualities in such an admirable manner as to be at twenty-seven utterly ruihed in purse and principle, - an idler, a spendthrift, and a glutton. He was free of his money; would spend his last guinea for a sensual gratification; would borrow from his neediest friend; had no kind of conscience or remorse left, but believed himself to be a good-natured, devil-may-care fellow; had a good deal of wit, and indisputably good manners, and a pleasing, dashing frankness in conversation with men. I should like to know how many such scoundrels our universities have turned out; and how much ruin has been caused by that accursed system, which is  called in England " the education of a gentleman." Go, my son, for ten years to a public school, that " world in miniature "; learn " to fight for yourself" against the time when your real struggles shall begin. Begin to be selfish at ten years of age; study for other ten  years; get a competent knowledge of boxing, swimming, rowing, and  cricket, with a pretty knack of Latin hexameters, and a decent smat-  tering of Greek plays, - do this and a fond father shall bless you, j -bless the two thousand pounds which he has spent in acquiring  all these benefits for you. And, besides, what else have you not learned? You have been many hundreds of times to chapel, and have learned to consider the religious service performied there as the vainest parade in the world. If your father is a grocer, you have been beaten for his sake, and have learned to be ashamed of him. You have learned to forget (as how should you remember, being separated from them for three fourths of your time?) the ties and  natural affections of home. You have learned, if you have a kindly heart and an open hand, to compete with associates much more s  v    .   , I  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6538-00000090"/> wealthy than yourself; and to consider money as not much, but honor-the honor of dining and consorting with your betters-- as a great deal. All this does the pulblic school and college-boy learn; and woe be to his knowledge! Alas, what natural tender- ness and kindly clinging filial affection is hle taught to trample on and despise! My friend Brandon had gone through this process of edu- cation, and had been irretrievably ruined by it, - his heart and his honesty had been ruined by it, that is to say; and lie lad received, in return for them, a small quantity of classics and mathematics, * pretty compensation for all he had lost in gaining them! But I am wandering most absurdly from the point; right or wrong, so nature and education had formed Mr. Brandon, who is one of a considerable class. Well, this young gentleman was established at Mrs. Gann's house; and we are obliged to enter into all these explanations concerning bim, because they are necessary to the right understanding of our story,-Brandon not being altogether a bad man, nor much worse than many a one who goes through a course of regular selfish swindling all his life long, and dies religious, resigned, proud of himself, and universally respected by others : for this eminent advantage has the getting-and-keeping scoundrel over the extravagant and careless one. One day, then, as he was gazing from the window of his lodging- house, a cart, containing a vast number of easels, portfolios, wooden- cases of pictures, and a small carpet-bag that might hold a change of clothes, stopped at the door. The vehicle was accompanied by a remarkable young fellow, dressed in a frock-coat covered over with frogs, a dirty turned-down shirt-collar, with a blue satin cravat,  and a cap placed wonderfully on one ear, who had evidently hired apartments at Mr. Gann's. This new lodger was no other than Mr. Andrew Fitch; or, as he wrote on his cards, without the prefix, ANDREA FITCH. Preparations had been made at Gann's for the reception of Mr.    Fitch, whose aunt (an auctioneer's lady in the town) had made ar- rangements that he should board and lodge with the Gann family, and have the apartments on the second floor as his private rooms. In these, then, young Andrea was installed. He was a youth of a poetic temperament, loving solitude; and where is such to be found more easily than on the storm-washed shores of Margate in winter? Then the boarding-house keepers have shut up their houses, and gone away in anguish; then the taverns take their carpets up, and you can have your choice of a hundred and twenty beds in any one of them; then but one dismal waiter remains to superintend this vast echoing pile of loneliness, and the landlord pines for summer; then the flies for Ramsgate stand tenantless beside the pier; and about four sailors, in pea-jackets, are to be seen in the three princi- pal streets; in the rest, silence, silence, closed shutters, torpid chim- neys, enjoying their unnatural winter sinecure, - not the clack of a patten echoing over the cold dry flags! This solitude had been chosen by Mr. Brandon for good reasons of his own; Gann and his family would have fled, but that they had no other house wherein to take refuge; and Mrs. Hammerton, the auctioneer's lady, felt so keenly the kindness which she was doing to Mrs. Gann; in providing her with a lodger at such a period, that shle considered herself fully justified in extracting from the latter a bonus of two guineas, threatening on refusal to send her darling nephew to a rival'establishment over the way. Andrea was here, then, in the loneliness that lie loved, - a fan- tastic youth, who lived but for his art; to whom the world was like the Coburg Theatre, and he in a magnificent costume acting a prin- cipal part. His art, and his beard and whiskers, were the darlings of his heart. His long pale hair fell over a high polished brow, which looked wonderfully thoughtful; and yet no man was more guiltless of thinking. He was always putting himself into attitudesi lie never spoke the truth; and was so entirely affected and absurd, as to be quite honest at last: for it is my belief that the man did not know truth from falsehood any longer, and was when he was alone, when he was in company, nay, when he was unconscious and  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6538-00000091"/> 176          GOOD STORIES. sound asleep snoring in bed, one complete lumnp of affectation. When his apartments on the second floor were arranged accordilng to his fancy, they made a tremendous show. He had a large Gothic chest, in which he put his wardrobe (naulely, two velvet waistcoats, four varied satin under ditto, two pairs braided trousers, two shirts, half a dozen false collars, and a couple of pairls of dread- fully dilapidated Blher boots). He had some pieces of armor; some China jugs and/Venetian glasses; some bits of old damask rags, to drape his doos and windows; and a rickety lay-figure in a Spanish hat and ak, over which slung a long Toledo rapier, and a guitar, with a ribbon of dirty sky-blue. Such was our poor fellow's stock ill trade. He had some vol- umes of poems, - "Lallahl Roolkh," and the sterner co-mpositions of Byron; for, to do him justice, lie bated "' Don Juan," and a woman was in his eyes an angel; a hangel, alas! he would call her, for nature and the circumstances of his family had taken sad Cockney advantages over Andrea's pronunciation. The Misses Wellesley Macarty were not, however, very squeamish with regard to grammar, and, in this dull season, voted--lr. Fitch an elegant young fellow. His immense beard and whiskers gave them the highest opinion of his genius; and before long the intimacy between the young people was considerable, for MrI. Fitch insisted upon drawing the portraits of the whole family. He painted Mrs. Gann in her rouge, and ribbons, as described by Mr1. Brandon; Mr. Gann, who said that his picture would be very useful to the artist, as every soul in Margate knew him ; and the Misses Macarty (a neat group, representing Miss Bella embracing Miss Linda, who was pointing to a piano-forte). "I suppose you'll do my Carry next," said Mr Gann, expressing his approbation of the last picture. "Law, sir," said Miss Linda, "Carry, with her red hair! -it would be ous." { Mr. Fitch might as well paint Becky, our maid," said Miss Bella. "Carry is quite impossible, Gann;" said Mrs. Gann; "she has n't a gown fit to be seen in. She's not been at church for thirteen Sundays in consequence."                  \   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          1" "And more shame for you, ma'am/," said Mr. Gann, who liked- his child; "Carry shall have a gown, and the best of gowns." And jingling three-and-twenty shillings in his pocket, Mr. Gann de- termined to spend them all in the purchase of a robe for Carry. But, alas! the gown never came; half the money was, spent that very evening at the Bag of Nails. "Is that-that young lady, your daughter?' said Mr. Fitch, surprised, for he fancied Carry was a humble conipanion of the family. "Yes, she his, and a very good daughter, too, sir," answered Mr, Gann. Fetch and Carry I call her, or else Carryvan,-she's so useful. An't you, Carry?" 'I'm very glad if I am, papa," said the young lady, who was blushing violently, and in whose presence all this conversation had been carried on. - Hold your tongue, miss,' said her mother; "you are very expensive to us, that you are, and need not brag about the work yoou do. You would not live on charity, would you, like some folks (here she looked fiercely at Mr. Gann); and if your sisters and me starve to keep you and some folks, I presume you are bound to make us some return. " When any allusion was made to Mr. Gann's idleness and ex- travagance, or his lady showed herself in any way inclined to be angry, it was honest James's habit not to answer, but to take his hat, and walk abroad to the public-house; or if haply she scolded him at night, he would turn his back and fall a snoring. These were the only remedies he found for Mrs. James's bad temper, and the first of them he adopted on hearing these words of his lady which we have just now transcribed. Poor Caroline had not her father's refuge of fight, but was obliged to stay and listen; and a wondrous eloquence, God wot! had Mrs. Gann upon the subject of her daughter's ill conduct. The first lecture Mr. Fitch heard, he set down Caroline for a monster. Was she not idle, sulky scornful, and a sloven? For these and many more of her daughter's vices Mrs. Gann vouched, declaring No. 4.     12  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6538-00000092"/> 178         GOOD STORIES. that Caroline's misbehavior was hastening her own death, and finishing by a fainting fit. In the presence of all these charges there stood Miss Caroline, dumb, stupid, and careless; nay, when the fainting fit came on, and Mrs. Gann fell back on the sofa, the unfeeling girl took the opportunity to retire, and never offered to smack her mamma's hands, to give her the smelling-bottle, or to re- store her with a glass of water. One stood close at hand; for Mr. Fitch, when this first fit occurred, was sitting in the Gann parlor, painting that lady's por- trait; and he was making towards her with his tumbler, when Miss Linda cried out, "Stop! -the water's full of paint" ; and straightway burst out laughing. Mrs. Glann jumped up at this, cured suddenly, E   and left the room, looking somewhat foolish. "You don't know ma," said Miss Linda, still giggling; ' she 's always faintingr." "Poor thing! a cried Fitch; s very nervous, I suppose " "O, very!" answered the lady, exchanging arch glances with Miss Bella. "Poor, dear lady!" continued the artist; "I pity her from my hinmost soul. Does n't the himmortal bard of Havon observe how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child? And is it true, Wa'am, that that young woman has been the ruin of her family?" '"Ruin of her fiddlestick!" replied Miss Bella. "Law, Mr. Fitch, you don't know ma yet; she is in one of her tantrums." 'What, then, it is n't true?" cried simple-minded Fitch; to which neither of the young ladies made any answer in words, nor could the little artist comprehend why they looked at each other, and burst out laughing. But he retired, pondering on what he had seen and heard; and being a very soft young fellow, most implicitly believed the accusations of poor dear Mrs. Gann, and thought her daughter Caroline was no better than a Regan or Goneril. A time, however, was to come when he should believe her to be a most pure and gentle Cordelia; and of this change in Fitch's opinions we shall speak in Chapter III.   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.,          17 CHAPTER      III. A SHABBY GENTEEL DINNER, AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF A LIKE NATURE. MR. BRANDON'S letter to Lord Cinqbars produced, as we have said, a great impression upon the family of Gann,-an impression which was considerably increased by their lodger's subsequent behavior; for although the persons with whom he now asso- ciated were of a very vulgar, ridiculous kind, they were by no means so low or ridiculous that Mr. Brandon should not wish to appear before them in the most advantageous light; and, accord- ingly, he gave himself the greatest airs when in their company, and bragged incessantly of his acquaintance and familiarity with the nobility. Mr. Brandon was a tuft-hunter of the genteel sort; his pride being quite as slavish, and his haughtiness as mean and cring- ing, in fact, as poor Mrs. Gann's stupid wonder and respect for all the persons whose names are written with titles before them. 0 free and happy Britons, what a miserable, truckling, cringing race you are! The reader has no doubt encountered a number of such swagger- ers in the course of his conversation with the world,-men of a decent middle rank, who affect to despise it, and herd only with per- sons of the fashion. This is an offence in a man which none of us can forgive; we call him tuft-hunter, lickspittle, sneak, unmanly; we hate, and profess to despise him. I fear it is no such thing. We envy Lickspittle, that is the fact; and therefore hate him. Were he to plague us with the stories of Jones and Brown, our familiars, the man would be a simple bore, his stories heard patiently; but so soon as he talks of my lord or the duke, we are in arms against him. I have seen a whole merry party in Russel Square grow suddenly gloomy and dumb, because a pert barrister, in a loud, shrill voice, told a story of Lord This or the Marquis of That. We all hated that man; and I would lay a wager that every  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6538-00000093"/> 180      -   GOOD STORIES. one .the fourteen persons assembled round the boiled turkey and saddle of mutton (not to mention side-dishes from the pastry-cook's opposite the British Museum),-I would wager, I say, that every one was muttering inwardly, "A plague on that fellow! lie knows a lord, and I never spoke to more than three in the whole course of my life." To our betters we can reconcile ourselves, if you please, respecting them very sincerely, laughing at their jokes, making allowance for their stupidities, meekly suffering their insolence; but we can't pardon our equals going beyond us. A firiend of mine who lived amicably and happily among his friends and relatives at Hackney was on a sudden disowned by the latter, cut by the former, and doomed in innumerable prophecies to ruin, because he kept a foothoy, -a harmless, little browsy-faced urchin, in light snuff-col- ored clothes, glistering over with sugar-loaf buttons. There is another man, a great man, a literary man, whom the public loves, and who took a sudden leap from obscurity into fame and wealth. This was a crime; but he bore his rise with so much modesty, that even his brethren of the pen did not envy him. One luckless day he set up a one-horse chaise; from that minute he was doomed. 6 Have you seen his new carriage?" says Snarley. "Yes," says Yow; " he's so consumedly proud of it, that he can't see his old friends while he drives." "Ith it a donkey-cart," lisps Simper, " thith gwand cawwaige? Ialways thaid that the man, from hith thtile, wath fitted to be a vewy dethent cothtermonger." "Yes, yes," cries old Candour, " a sad pity indeed! - dreadfully extravagant, I'm told, - bad health, - expensive family, - works going down every day, - and now he must set up a carriage, for- sooth!" Snarley, Yow, Simper, Candour, hate their brother. If he is ruined, they will be kind to him and just; but he is successful, and woe be to him! This trifling digression of half a page or so, although it seems to have -nothing to do with the story in hand, has, nevertheless, the strongest relation to it; and you shall hear what.   A SIIABBY GENTEEL STORY.          18 In one word, then, Mr. Brandon bragged so much, and assumed such airs of superiority, that after a while he perfectly disgusted Mrs. Gann and the Misses Macarty, who were gentlefolks them- selves, and did not at all like his way of telling them that he was their better. Mr. Fitch was swallowed up in his hart, as he called it, and cared nothing for Brandon's airs. Gann, being a low-spir- ited fellow, completely submitted to Mr. Brandon, and looked up to him with deepest wonder. And poor little Caroline followed her father's faith, and in six weeks after Mr. Brandon's arrival at the lodgings had grown to believe him the most perfect, finished, pol- ished, agreeable of mankind. Indeed, the poor girl had never seen a gentleman before, and towards such her gentle- heart turned instinctively. Brandon never offended her by hard words; in- sulted her by cruel scorn, such as she met with from her mother and her sisters; there was a quiet manner about the man quite different to any that she had before seen amongst the acquaintances of her family; and if he assumed a tone of superiority in his conversation with her and the rest, Caroline felt that he was their superior, and as such admired and respected him. What happens when in the innocent bosom of a girl of sixteen such sensations arise? What has happened ever since the world began? I have said that Miss Caroline had no friend in the world but her father, and must here take leave to recall that assertion; - a friend she most certainly had, and that was honest Recky, the smutty maid, whose name has been mentioned before. Miss Caroline had learned, in the course of a life spent under the tyranny of her mamma, some of the notions of the latter, and would have been very much offended to call Becky her friend; but friends, in fact, they were; and a great comfort it was for Caroline to descend to the calm kitchen from the stormy back-parlor, and there rent some of her little woes to the compassionate servant of all work. When Mrs. Gann went out with her daughters, Becky would take her work, and come and keep Miss Caroline company; and if the truth must be told, the greatest enjoyment the pair used to have  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6538-00000094"/> 18-;         GOOD STORIES. was in these afternoons, when they read} together out of the precious greasy, marble-covered volumes that Mrs. Gann was insthe habit of fetching from the library. Many and many a tale had the pair so gone through. I can see them over "Manfrone, or the One- handed Monk - the room dark, the street silent, the hour tell - the tall, red, lurid candlewick wagoling down, the flame flickering pale upon Miss Caroline's pale face as she read out, and lighting up honest Becky's goggling eyes, who sat silent, her work in her lap: she had not done a stitch of it for an hour. As the trap-door slowly opens, and the scowling Alollzo, bending over the sleeping Imoinda, draws his pistol, cocks it, looks well if the priming be right, places it then to the sleepers ear, and - thunder-under-under - -down fall the snuffers! Becky has had them in hand for ten minutes, afraid to use them. Up starts Caroline, and flings the book back into her mamma's basket. It is that lady returned with her daughters from a tea-party, where two young gents from London have been mighty genteel indeed. For the sentimental, too, as well as for the terrible, Miss Caro- line and the cook had a strong predilection, and had wept their poor eyes out over "Thaddeus of Warsaw " and the "Scottish Chiefs." Fortified by the examples drawn from those instructive volumes, Becky was firmly convinced that her young mistress would meet with a great lord some day or other, or be carried off, like Cinderella, by a brilliant prince, to the mortification of her elder sisters, whom Becky hated. And when, therefore, the new lodger came, lonely, mysterious, melancholy, elegant, with the romantic name of George Brandon,- when he wrote a letter directed to a lord, and Miss Caroline and Becky together examined the superscription,--such a look passed between them as the pencil of Leslie or Maclise could alone describe for us. Becky's orbs were lighted up with a preter- natural look of wondering wisdom; whereas, after an instant, Caro- line dropped hers, and blushed, and said, "Nonsense, Becky." "Is it nonsbse?" said Becky, grinning and snapping her fin- gers with a triumphant air; " the cards comes true; I knew they would. Did n't you have king and queen of hearts three deals   A - SHABBY GENTEEL STOR Y.        l^  running?  What did you dream  about last Tuesday, tell me that?" But MDiss Caroline never did tell, for her sisters came bouncing down the stairs, and examined the lodger's letter. Caroline, how- ever, went away musing much upon these points; and she began to think Mr. Brandon more wonderful and beautiful every day. In the mean time, while Miss Caroline was innocently indulging in her inclination for the brilliant occupier of the first floor, it came, to pass that the tenant of the second was inflamed by a most ro- iantic passion for her. For, after partaking for about a fortnight of the family dinner, and passing some evenings with Mrs. Gann and the young ladies, Mr. Fitch, though by no means quick of comprehension, began to perceive that the nightly charges that were brought against poor Caroline could not be founded upon truth. "Let's see," mused he to himself; "Tuesday, the old lady said her daughter was bringing her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, because the cook had not boiled the potatoes. Wednesday, she said Caroline was an assassin, because she could not find her own thimble. Thursday, she vows Caroline has no religion, because that old pair of silk stockings were not darned. And this can't be," reasoned Fitch, deeply. ' A gal haint a murderess because her ma can't find her thimble. A woman that goes to slap her grown-up daughter on the back, and before company too, for such a ptaltry thing as a hold pair of stock- ings, can't be surely a-speaking the truth." And thus gradually his first impression against Caroline wore away s As this disap- peared, pity took possession of his soul, - and we know what pity is akin to; and, at the same time, a corresponding hatred for the op- pressors of a creature so amiable. To sum up, in six short weeks after the appearance of the two gentlemen, we find our chief dramatis persone as follows :- CAROLINE, an innocent young woman, in love with BRANDON.

MDacarty when they went out to walk, nor were they displeased at his attentions but he found that there were a great numllnber of Margate beaux, - ugly, vulgar fellows as ever were, - who always followed in the young ladies' train, and made themselves infinitely more agreeable than he was. These men Mr. Brandon treated with a great deal of scorn; and, in return, they hated him cor dially. So did the ladies speedily: his hlaughty manners, though quite as impertinent and free, were not half so pleasant to them as Jones's jokes or Smith's charming romps; and the girlls gave 1Bra n- don very shortly to understand that they were much halpDierl withl- out him. "Ladies, your humble," lie heard Bob Smith say, as that little linen-draper came skipping to the door fiornom which they were issuing: "The sun 's hup and trade is down ; if you 're for a walk, I'm your man." And Miss Linda and Miss Bella each took an arm of Mr. Smith, and sailed down the street. "I'm glad you ain't got that proud gent with the glass hi," said Mr. Smith: " he's the most hillbred, supercilious beast I ever see." "So he is,' says Bella.    - s Hush!" says Linda. The " proud gent with the glass hi" was at this moment lolling out of the first-floor window, smoking his accustomed cigar; and his eyeglass was fixed upon the ladies, to whom he made a very low bow. It may be imagined how fond he was of them afterwards, and what loolks he cast at Mr. Bob Smith the next time he met him. Mr. Bob's heart beat for a day afterwards; and he found he had business in towii. But the love of society is stronger than even pride; and the great Mr. Brandon was sometimes fain to descend, from his high station, and consort with the vulgar family with whom he lodged. But, as we have said, he always did this with a wonderfully conde- scending air, giving his associates to understand -howr great was the honor he did them. One day, then, he was absolutely so kind as to accept of an in- vitation from the ground-floor, which was delivered in the passage by MSr. James Gann, who said: "It was hard to see a gent eating   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          185 mutton-chops from week's end to week's end-; and if Mr. Brandon had a mind to meet a devilish good fellow as ever was, my friend Swighy, a man who rides his horse, and has his five hundred a year to spend, and to eat a prime cut out of as good a leg of pork (though he said it) as ever a knife was stuck into, they should dine that day at three o'clock sharp, and Mrs. G. and the gals would be glad of the honor of his company." The person so invited was rather amused at the terms in which SIr. Gann conveyed his hospitable message; and at -three o'clock nmade his appearance in the back-parlor, whence he had the honor of conducting Mrs. Gann (dressed in a sweet yellow mousseline de laine, with a large red turban, a ferroniere, and a smelling-bottle attached by a ring to a very damp, fat hand) to the " office," where the repast was set out. The Misses Macarty were in costumes equally tasty ; one on the guest's right hand; one near the boarder, Mr. Fitch, who, in a large beard, an amethyst velvet waistcoat, his hair fresh wetted, and parted accurately down the middle to fall in curls over his collar, would lhave been irresistible if the collar had been a little, little whiter than it was. Mr. Brandon, too, was dressed in his very best suit; for though he affected to despise his hosts very muchl, he wished to make the most favorable impression upon them, and took care to tell Mrs. Gann that he and Lord So-and-so were the only two men in the world who were in possession of that particular waistcoat which she admired; for Mrs. Gann was very gracious, and had admired the waistcoat, being desirous to impress with awe- Mr. Gann's friend and admirer, Mr. Swighy, who, man of fortune as he was, was a constant frequenter of the club at the Bag of Nails. - About this club and its supporters Mr. Gann's guest, Mr. Swighy, and Gann himself, talked very gayly before dinner; all the jokes about all the club being roared over by the pair. Mr. Brandon, wlo felt he was the great man of the party, indulged himself in his great propensities without restraint, and told Mrs. Gann stories about half the nobility. Mrs. Gann conversed know- ingly about-the Opera; and declared that she thought Taglioni the w   aeetestf. infrur in the-worrld.  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6538-00000096"/> 18B?          GOOD STORIES. "Mr. - a- Swighy, have you ever seen Lablache dance?" asked Mr. Brandon of that gentleman, to whom he had been formally in- troduced. "At Vauxhall, is he?" said Mr. Swighy, who was just from town. "Yes, on the tight rope; a charming performer." On which Mr. Gann told how he had been to Vauxhall when the princes were in London; and his lady talked of these knowingly. And then they fell to conversing about fire-works and rack-punch; Mr. Brandon assuring the young ladies that Vauxhall was the very pink of the fashion, and longing to have the honor of dancing a qua- drille with them there. Indeed, Brandon was so very sarcastic, that not a single soul at table understood him. The table, from Mr. Brandon's plan of it, which was afterwards sent to my Lord Cinqbars, was arranged as follows: Miss Caroline. Mr. Fitch. Miss L. Macarty. 1.     Potatoes.    3.

"O, in course, a commoner's table!- we have no titles, sir (Mr. Gann, I will trouble you for some more crackling), though my poor dear girls are related, by their blessed father's side, to some of the first nobility in the land, I assure you." Mr. Gann. "Gammon, Jooly, my dear. Them Irish nobility, you know, what are they? And, besides, it's my belief that the gals are no more related to them than I am."  Miss Bella (to Mr. Brandon, confidentially). "You must find that poor par is sadly vulgar, Mr. Brandon." Jirs. Gann. "Mr. Brandon has never been accustomed to such language, I am sure; and I entreat you will excuse Mr. Gann's rudeness, sir." Miss Linda. "Indeed, I assure you, Mr. Brandon, that we've high connections as well as low; as high as some people's connec- tions, per'aps, though we are not always talking of the nobility." This was a double shot; the first barrel of Miss Linda's sentence hit her step-father, the second part was levelled directly at Mr. Brandon. "Don't you think I'm right, Mr. Fitch?" Mr. Brandon. "You are quite right, Miss Linda, in this as in every other instance ; but I am afraid Mr. Fitch has not paid proper attention to your excellent remark; for, if I don't mistake the mean- ing of that beautiful design which he has made with his fork upon the table-cloth, his soul is at this moment wrapped up in his art." This was exactly what Mr. Fitch wished that all the world should suppose. He flung back his hair, and stared wildly for a moment, and said, "Pardon me, madam: it is true, my thoughts were at that moment far away in the regions of my hart." He was really think- ing that his attitude was a very elegant one, and that a large garnet ring which he wore on his forefinger must be mistaken by all the company for a ruby. "Art is very well," said Mr. Brandon; "but with such pretty natural objects before you, I wonder you were not content to think of them." "Do you mean the mashed potatoes, sir?" said Andrea Fitch, wordering.   &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6538-00000097"/> "I mean Miss Rosalind Macarty," answered Brandon, gallantly, and laughing heartily at the painter's simplicity. But this compli- ment could not soften- Miss Linda, who had an uneasy conviction that Mr. Brandon was laughiing, at her, and disliked him accord- ingly. At this juncture Miss Caroline entered and took the place marked as hers, to the left hand of Mr. Gann, vacant. An old rickety wooden stool was placed for her, instead of that elegant and commo- dious Windsor chair, which supported every otier person art table; and by the side of the plate stood a curious old battered tin mu1gV, on which the antiquarian might possibly discover the inscription of tile word  Caroline." This' in truth, was poor Caroline's mug and stool, having been appropriated to her from childhood upwards; and here it was her custom meekly to sit, and eat her daily meal. It was well that the girl was placed near her father, else I do believe she would have been starved; but Gann was much too good-natured to allow that any difference should be inade between her and her sisters. There are some meannesses which are too mean even for man, - woman, lovely woman alone, can venture to commit them. Well, on the present occasion, and when the dinner was half over, poor Caroline stole gently into the room and took her ordinary place. Caroline's pale face was very red; for the fact' must be told, that she had been in the kitchen helping Becky, the universal maid; and having heard how the great Mr. Brandon was to dine with them upon that day,Athe simple girl had been showing her respect for him, by compilingl in her best manner, a certain dislh, for the cooking of which her papa had often praised her. She took her place, blushing violently when she saw him, and if Mr. Gann had not been making a violent clattering with his knife and fork, it is possible that you might bave heard Miss Caroline's heart thump, which it did violently. Her dress was somehow a little smarter than usual; and Becky the maid, who brought in that remove of hashed mutton which has been set down in the bill of fare, looked at her young lady with a good deal of complacency, at, loaded with plates, she quitted the room. Indeed, the poor'girl   d- -A- &amp; --.-  'L A A-U."fXJ     . 180 9 deserved to be looked at; there was an air of gentleness and 'inno- cence about her that was apt to please some persons much more -than the bold beauties of her sisters. The two young men did not fail to remark this; one of them, the little painter, had long since observed it. "You are very late, miss," cried Mrs. Gann, who affected not to know what had caused her daughter's delay. "You're always late!" and the elder girls stared and grinned at each other know- ingly, as they always did when' mamma made such attacks upon Caroline, who only kept her eyes down upon the table-cloth, and began to eat her dinner without saying a word. "Come, my dear," cried honest Gann, "if she is late, you know why. A girl can't be here and there too, as I say; can they, Swighy?  "Impossible!" said Swighy. "Gents," continued Mr. Gann, "our Carry, you must know, has been down stairs, making the pudding for her old pappy; and a good pudding she makes I can tell you." Miss Caroline blushed more vehemently than ever; the artist stared her full in the face; Mrs. Gann  said, "nonsenseJ9 and "cstuff," very majestically; only Mr. Brandon interposed in Caro- line's favor. "I would sooner that my wife should know  how to make a pudding," said he, "than how to play the best piece of music in the world." "Law, Mr. Brandon! I, for my  part, would n't demean myself by any such kitchen work!" cries Miss Linda. "Make puddns, indeed; it's ojous!" cries Bella. "For you, my   loves, of course!" interposed their mamma. "Young women of your family and circumstances is not expected to perform any such work. It's different with Miss Caroline,-who, if she does make herself useful now and then, don't make herself near so useful as she should, considering that -she 's not a shilling, and is living on our charity, like some other folks." Thus did this amiable woman neglect no opportunity to give her  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6538-00000098"/> 190         GOOD,- STORIES. u  opinions about her husband: and daughter. The former, however, cared not a straw, and the latter, in this instance, was perfectly happy. Had not kind Mr. Brandon ap prved of her work; and could she ask for more?  Mamma may say what s I eases to-day," thought Caroline, C I am too happy to be made angry by her." Poor little mistaken Caroline, to think you were safe against three women! The dinner 'had not advanced much further, when Miss Isabella, who had been examining her younger sister curiously for some short time, telegraphed Miss Linda across the table, and nodded, and pointed to her own neck; a very white one, as I have before had the honor to remark, and quite without any covering, except a smart necklace of twenty-four rows of the lightest blue glass beads, finishing in a neat tassel. Linda had a similar orna- ment of a vermilion color; whereas Caroline, on this occasion, wore a handsome new collar up to the throat, and a brooch, which looked all the smarter for the shabby frock over which they were placed. As soon as she saw her sisters' signals, the poorl little thing, who  had only just done fluttering and blushing, fell to this same work over' again. Down went her eyes once more, and her face and neck lighted up to the color of Miss Linda's sham cornelian. What's the gals giggling and ogling about?" said Mr. Gann, innocently. s What is it, my darling loves?" said stately Mrs. Gann. " Why don't you see, ma?" said Linda. "Look at Miss Carry! I'm blessed if shze has not got on Becky's collar and brooch that Sims, the pilot, gave her!" The young ladies fell back in uproarious fits of laughter, and laughed all the time that their mamma was thundering out a speech, in which she declared that her daughter's conduct was unworthy a gentlewoman, and bid her leave the room and take off those dis- graceful ornaments. There was no nee to tell her; the poor little thing gave one pit- eous look at her fathers who was whistling, and seemed indeed to think the matter a good joke; and after she had managed to open   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY- 191 the door and totter into the passage, you might hate heard her weeping there, weeping tears more bitter than any of te many she  had shed in the course of her life. Down she went to the kitchen, and when she reached that humble place of refuge, first pulled at her neck and made as if she would take off Becky's collar and brooch, and then flung, herself into the arms of that honest scullion, where she cried and cried till she brought on the first fit of hyster- ics that ever she had had. This crying could not at first be heard in the parlor,-where the Dyoun ladies, krs. Gann, Mr. Gann, and his friend from the Bag of Nails were roaring at the excellence of the joke. Mr. Brandon, sipping sherry, sat by, looking very sarcastically and slyly from one party to the other; M-r. Fitch was staring about him too, but with a very different expression, anger and wonder inflaming his bearded countenance. At last, as the laughing died away and a faint voice of weeping came from the kitchen below, Andrew could bear it no longer, but bounced up from his chair and rushed out of the room exclaiming-  "By Jove, it's too bad!" "What does the man mean?" said Mrs. Gann. He meant that he was from that moment over head and ears in love with' Caroline and that he longed to beat, buffet, pummel, thump, tear to pieces, those callous ruffians who so piteously laughed at her. "What's that chop wi' the beard in such tantrums about?" said the gentleman from the Bag of Nails. Mr. Gann answered this query by some joke intimating that, "P'r'yaps Mr. Fitch's dinner did not agree with him," at which these worthies roared again. The young ladies said, "Well, now, upon my word!" "Mighty genteel behavior truly!" cried mamma; "but what can you expect from the poor thing?" Brandon only sipped more sherry, but he looked at Fitch as the latter flung out of the room, and his countenance was lighted up by a more unequivocal smile. *     *    *     *    -*: -  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6538-00000099"/> :*  e -'  :  - i' GOD STORIES.             I These two little adventures were followed by a silence of some few minutes, during which the meats remained on the table, and no signs were shown of that pudding upon which poor Caroline had exhausted her skill. Tihe absence of this delicious part of the repast was first remarked by Mr. Gann ; and his lady, after jang- ling at the bell for some time in vain, at last begged one of her daughters to go and hasten matters. "BECKY!"' shrieked Miss Linda from the hallt but Becky re- plied not. "Becky, are we to be kept waiting all day?" continued the lady in the same shrill voice. ( Mamma wants the pudding!" "TELL HER TO FETCH IT HERSELF! roared Becky, at which remark Gann and his facetious firiend once more went off into fits of laughter. 'This is too'bad " said Mrs. G. starting up; " she shall leave the house this instant!" and so no doubt Becky would, but that the lady owed her five quarters' wages; which she, at that period, did not feel inclined to pay. Well, the dinner at last was at an end; the ladies went away to tea, leaving the gentlemen to their wine; Brandoln, very conde- scendingly, partaking of a bottle of port, and listening with admi- ration to the toasts and sentiments with which it is still the custom among persons of Mr. Gann's rank of life to preface each glass of wine.

"i5 The pleasure of the evening was quite spoiled; and as the conver- sation became rapid and dull, we shall refrain from reporting it. Mr. Brandon speedily took leave, but had not the courage to face the ladies at tea; to whom it appears the reconciled Becky had brought that refreshing beverage. CHAPTER IV. IN WHCH MR. FITCH PROCLAIMS HS LOVE, AND MR. BRANDON PREPARES FOR WAR. FROM the splendid'halls in which Mrs. Gain was dispensing her hospitality, the celebrated painter, Andrea Fitch, rushed forth in a state of mind even more delirious than that which he usually en- joyed. He looked abroad into the street, all there was dusk and -lonely; the rain falling heavily, the wind playing Pandaean pipes and whistling down the chimney-pots. "Ilove the storm," said Fitch, solemnly; and he put his great Spanish cloak round him in the most approved manner (it was of so prodigious a size that the tail of it, as it twirled over his shoulder, whisked away a lodoing-card from the door of the house opposite Mr. Gann's). "I love the storm and solitude," said he, lighting a large pipe filled full of the fragrant Oronooko; and thus armed, he passed rapidly down the street, his hat cocked over his ringlets. Andrea did not like smoking, but he used a pipe as a part of his profession as an artist, and as one of the picturesque parts of his costume; in like manner, though he did not fence, he always trav- elled about with a pair of foils; and quite unconscious of music, nevertheless had a guitar constantly near at hand. Without such properties a painter's spectacle is not complete, and now he deter- mined to add to them another indispensable requisite, -a mistress. "What great artist was ever without one?" thought he. Long,  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6538-00000101"/> 196         GOOD STORIES. long had he sighed .for some one whom he might love, some one to whom he might address the poems which he was in the habit of making. Hundreds of such firaments had he composed, addressed to Leila, Ximena, Ada,-- imaginary beauties, whom he courted in dreamy verse. With what joy would he replace all those by a real charmer of flesh and blood! Away he went, then, on this evening, the tyranny of Mrs. Gann towards poor Caroline hiaving awakened all his sympathies in the gentle girl's favor, determined now and for- ever to make her the mistress of his heart. Monna-Lisa, the For- narina, Leonardo, Raphael, - he thought of all these, and vowed that his Caroline should be made famous and live forever on hiis canvass While Mrs. Gann was preparing for her friends, and en- tertaining them at tea and whist; while Caroline, all unconscious of the love she inspired, was weeping up stairs in her little garret; while Mr. Brandon was enjoying the refined conversation of Gann and Swighy, over their glass and pipe in the office, - Andrea walked abroad by the side of the ocean; and, before he was wet through, walked himself into the most fervid affection for poor, persecuted Caroline. The reader might have observed him (had not the night been very dark, and. a great deal too wet to allow a sensible reader to go abroad on such an errand) at the sea-shore, standing on a rock, and drawing from his bosom a locket which contained a curl of hair tied up in ribbon. He looked at it for a moment, and then flung it away from him into the black, boiling waters below him, "No other 'air but thine, Caroline, shall ever rest near this 'art!? he said, and kissed the locket and restored it to its place. Light- minded youth, whose hair was it that he thus flung away? How many times had Andrea shown that very ringlet in strictest confi- dence- to several brethren of the brush, and declared that it was the hair of a dear girl in Spain whom he loved to madness? fAlas  't was but a fiction of his fevered brain; every one of his friends had a locket of hair, and Andrea, who had no love until now, had clipped this precious token from the wig of a lovely lay-figure, with cast- iron joints and a cardboard head, that had stood for some time in his atelier. I don't know that he felt any shame about the proceed-   A SHA BBY GENTEEL -STORY.         197 ing, for he was of such a warm imagination that he had grown to believe that the hair did actually come from ^ girl in Spain, and only parted with it on yielding to a supelrior attachment. This attachment being fixed on, the young painter came home wet through; passed the night in reading Byron; making sketches, and burning them ; writing poems to Caroline, and expungingi them with pitiless Indian rubber. A romantic man makes a point of sit- ting up all night, and pacing his chamber; and you may see many a composition of Andrea's dated, "Midnight, 10th of March, A. F.," with his peculiar flourish over the initials. He was not sorry toobe told in the morning, by the ladies at breakfast, that he looked dread- fully pale; and answered, laying his hand on his forehead, and shaking his head gloomily, that he could get no sleep: and then he would heave a huge sigh; and Miss Bella and Miss Linda would look at each other, and grin according to their wont. He was glad, I say, to have his woe remarked, and continued his sleeplessness for two or three nights; but he was certainly, still more glad when he heard Mr. Brandon, on the fourth morning, cry out, in a shrill angry voice, to Becky the maid, to give the gentleman up stairs his complinments, - Mr. Brandon's compliments, - and tell him that he' could not get a wink of sleep for the horrid trampling he kept up. I am hanged if I stay in this house a night longer," added the first floor slharply, c if that Mr. Fitch kicks up such a confounded noise! Mr. Fitch's point was gained, and henceforth he was as quiet as a mouse; but his wish was not only to be in love, but to let everybody know that he was in love, or where is the use of a belle passionz? So, whenever he saw Caroline, at meals, or in the passage, he used to stare at her with the utmost power of his big eyes, and fall to groaning most pathetically. He used to leave his meals un- tasted, groan, heave sighs, and stare incessantly. Mrs. Gann and her eldest daughters were astonished at these manoeuvres; for they never suspected that any man could possibly be such a fool as to h fall in love with Caroline. At length the suspicion came upon- the'm, created immense laughter and delight; and the ladies did not fail to rally Caroline in their usual elegant way. Gann, too; loved  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6538-00000102"/> 198         GOOD STORIES. a joke (much polite waggery had this worthy man practised in select inn-parlors for twenty years past), and would call poor Caro- line I'Mrs. F."; and say that, instead of Fetch-and-Carry, as he used to name her, he should style her Fitch-and-Carry for the future; and laugh at this great pun, and make many others of a similar sort, that set Caroline- blushing. Indeed, the girl suffered a great deal more from this raillery than at first may be imagined; for after the first awe inspired by Fitch's  whiskers had passed away, and he had drawn the young ladies' pictures, and made designs in their albums, and inthe midst of their jokes and conversation had remained perfectly silent, the Gann family had determined that the man was an idiot; and, in- deed, were not very wide of the mark. In everything except his own peculiar art honest Fitch was an idiot; and as upon the sub- ject of painting, the Ganns, like most people of their class in Eng- land, were profoundly ignorant, it came to pass that he would breakfast and dine for many days in their company, and not utter one single syllable. So they looked upon him with extreme pity and contempt, as a harmless, good-natured, crack-brained creature, quite below them in the scale of intellect, and only to be endured because he paid a certain number of shillings weekly to the Gann exa equer. Mrs. Gann in all companies was accustomed to talk about her idiot. Neighbors and children used to peer at him as he strutted down the street; and though every young lady, includ- ing my dear Caroline is flattered by having a lover, at least they don't like such a lover as this. The Misses Macarty (after having set their caps at him very fiercely, and quarrelled concerning him on his first comig to lodge at their house) vowed and protested now-that he was no better than a chimpanzee; and Caroline and Becky agreed that this insult was as great as any that could be paid to the former. "He's a good creature, too,' said Becky, "cracked-brained as he is. Do you know, miss, he gave me half a sovereign to buy a new collar, after that business t' other day?" And did- Mr.--, -did the first floor say anything?" asked Caroline.   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.         199 1"Didn't he! he's a funny gentleman, that Brandon, sure Pnough; and when I took him up breakfast next morning, asked about Sims the pilot, and what I gied Sims for the collar and brooch, - he, he!" And this was indeed a correct report of Mr. Brandon's conver- sation with Becky; he had been infinitely amused with the whole transaction, and wrote his friend the viscount a capital facetious account of the manners and customs of the native inhabitants of the Isle of Thanet.. And now, when Mr. Fitch's passion was fully developed,- as far, that is, as sighs and ogles could give it utterance,- a curious instance of that spirit of contradiction for which our race is remark- able was seen in the behavior of Mr. Brandon. Although Caroline, in the depths of her little silly heart, had set him down for her divinity, her wondrous fairy prince, who was to deliver her from her present miserable durance, she had never by word or deed acquainted Brandon with her inclination for him, but had, with instinctive modesty, avoided him more sedulously than before. He, too, had never bestowed a thought upon her. How should such a Jove as Mr. Brandon, from the cloudy summit of his fash- ionable Olympus, look down and perceive such an humble, retiring being as poor little Caroline Gann? Thinking her at first not disagreeable, he had never, until the day of the dinner, bestowed one single further thought upon her; and only when exasperated by the Miss Macartys' behavior towards him, did he begin to think how sweet it would be to make them jealous and unhappy. "The uncouth grinning molnsters," said he, " with their horrible court of Bob Smiths and Jack Joneses, daring to look down upon me, a gentleman, - me, the celebrated mangeur des ecwurs, -a man of genius, fashion, and noble family! If I could but revenge my- self on them! What injury can I invent to wound them." It is curious to what points a man in his passion will go. Mr. Brandon had long since, in fact, tried to do the greatest possible. injury to the young ladies; for it had been, at the first dawn of his acquaintance, as we are bound with much sorrow to confess, his  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6538-00000103"/> --W.         GOOD STORIES. fixed intention to ruin one or the other of them, And when the young ladies had, by their coldness and indifference to him, frustrated. this benevolent intention, he straightway fancied that they had in- jured him severely, and cast about for means to revenge himself upon them. This point is, to be sure, a very delicate one to treat, - for in words, at least, the age has grown to be wonderfully nmoral, and refuses to hear discourses upon such subjects. But human nature, as far as I am able to learn, has not much changed since the time when Richardson wrote and Hogarth painted, a centiry ago. There are wicked Lovelaces abroad, ladies, now, as then, when it was considered no shame to expose the rogues; and pardon us, therefore, for hinting that such there be. Elegant acts of roueriez such as that meditated by Mr. Brandon, are often performed still  -by dashing young men of the world, who think no sin of an amnou- rette, but- glory in it, especially if the victim be a person of mean condition. Had Brandon succeeded (such is the high moral state of our British youth), all his frfiends would have pronounced him, and. he would have considered himiself, to be a very lucky, capti- vating dog; nor, as I believe, would hle have had a singrle pang of conscience for the rascally action which he had committed. This supreme act of scoundrelism has man permitted to himself to deceive women. When we consider how he has availed hinmself of the privilege so created by him, indeed one may sympathize with the advocates of woman's riglhts who point out this monstrous wrong. We have read of that wretched woman of old whom the pious Pharisees waee for stoning incontinenltly; but we don't helr that they made any outcry against the man who was concerned in the crime. Where was he? Happy, no doubt, and easy in minlld, and regaling some choice friends over a bottle withl the history of his success. Being thus injured then, Mr. Brandon longed for revenge. Hlow should he repay these imnpertinent youngt women for sligrltin-g his: addresses? - "Bardi," said he ; "just to punish their pride and ilso- lencei I have a great mind to make love to their sister."'   A SHAOBBY GENTE-EL- STORY. -R . He did not, however, for some time condescend to perform this threat. Eagles such as Brandon do not sail ddwn from the clouds in olrder to pounce upon small flies, and soar airwards again con- tented with such an ignoble booty. In a word, he never gave a minute's thought to Miss Caroline, until fturther circumstances occurred which caused this great man to consider her as an object somewhat worthy of his remark. Thle violent affection suddenly exhibited by Mr. Fitch, the paint- er, towards poor little Caroline, was the point which determined Brandon to begin to act.

"And to think that he was a reading man- too, and took a double first," cried another; " why, the man 's an Admirable Crichton." "Upon my life, though, he's a little too bad,"' said a third, who was a moralist. And with this a fresh bowl of milk-punch came reeking from the .college butteries, and the jovial party discussed that. CHAPTER V. CONTAINS A GREAT DEAL OF COMPLICATED LOVE-MAKING. THE Misses Macarty were excessively indignant that Mr. Fitch. should have had the audacity to fall in love with their sister ; and poor Caroline's life was not, as may be imagined, made much the happier by the envy and passion thus excited. Mr. Fitch's amour was the source of a great deal of pain to her. Her mother would tauntingly say, that as both were beggars, they could not do better than marry; and declared, in the same satirical way, that she should like nothing better than to see a large family of grandchildren - about her, to be plagues and burdens upon her, as her daughter was. The short way would have been, when the young painter's intentions were manifest, which they pretty speedily were, to have requested him immediately to quit the house ; or, as Mr. Gann said, 4' to give him the sack at once" ; to which measure the worthy man indignantly F              .  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6538-00000105"/> L4sV3        J  L J JL .  cLraLft 1 tfs . avowed that he would have resort. But his lady wouald slot allow of any such rudeness; although, for her part, she professed the strongest scorn and contempt for the painter. For the painful faict must be stated: Fitch had a short time previously paid no less a sum than a whole quarter's board and lodging in advance, at Mrs. Gann's humble request, and he possessed hs landlady's receipt for that sum; the mention of which circumstance silenced Gann's objections at once. And indeed, it is pretty certain that, with all her taunts to her daughter and just abuse of Fitch's poverty, Mrs. Gann in her heart was not altogether averse to the match. In the first place, she loved match-making; next, she 'would be glad to be rid of her daughter at any rate; and, besides, Fitch's aunt, the auctioneers wife, was rich, and had no children; painters, as shed had heard,  mnake often a great deal of money, and Fitch might be a clever one, for aught she knew. So he was allowed to remain in the house, an undeclared but very assiduous lover; and to sigh, and to moan, and make verses and portraits of his beloved, and build castles in the air as best he might. Indeed, our humble Cindelrella was in a very curious position. She felt a tender passion for the first floor, and was adored by the second floor, and had to wait upon both at the summons of the bell of either ; and as the poor little things was com- pelled not to notice any of the sighs and glances which the painter bestowed upon her, she also had schooled herself to maintain a quiet demeanor towards Mr. Brandon, and not allow him to discov- er the secret which was laboring in her little breast. I think it may be laid down as a pletty general rule, that most romantic little girls of Caroline's are have such a budding sentiment w as this young person entertained; quite innocent of course ; nourished and talked of in delicious secrecy to the conzfidante of the hour. Or else what are novels made for? Had Caroline read of Valan- court and Emily for nothing, or gathered no good example from those five tear-fraught volumes which describe the loves of Miss Helen Mar and Sir Wtilliam Wallace? Many a time had she depicted Brandon in fancy costume, such as the fascinating Valan- court wore; or painted herself as Helen, tying a sash round her : ; A .           . :...    .i..   . ..   -   jaUliuuj   jax i .tv1 J XL .jb otVSY j. - 208' knight's cuirass, and watching him forth to battle. Silly fancies, no doubt; but consider, madam, the poor girl's age and education; the only instruction she had ever received was from these tender, kind- hearted, silly books: the only happiness which Fate had allowed her was in this little silent world of fancy. It would be hard to grudge the poor thing her dreams; and many such did she have, and impart blushingly to honest Becky as they sat by the humble kitchen-fire. Although it cost her heart a great pang, she had once ventured to implore her mother not to send her up stairs to the lodgers' rooms, for she shrunk at the notion of the occurrence that Brandon should discover her regard for him; but this point had never entered Mrs. Gann's sagacious head. She thought her daughter wished to avoid Fitch, and sternly bade her do her duty, and not give herself such impertinent airs; and, indeed, it can't be said that poor Caroline was very sorry at being compelled to continue to see Brandon. To do both gentlemen justice, neither ever said a word unfit for Caroline to hear. Fitch would have been torn to pieces by a thousand wild horses rather than have breathed a single syllable to hurt her feel- ings; and Brandon, though by no means so squeamish on ordinary occasions, was innately a gentleman, and from taste rather than from  virtue was carefully respectful in his behavior to her. As for the. Misses Macarty themselves, it has been stated that they had already given away their hearts several times; Miss Isabella being at this moment attached to a certain young winc- merchant, and to Lieutenant or Colonel Swabber of the Spanish service; and Miss Rosalind having a decided fondness for a foreign nobleman, with black mustachios, who had paid a visit toMargate. Of Miss Bella's lovers, Swabber had disappeared; but she still met the wine-merchant pretty often, and it is believed had gone very nigh to accept him. As for Miss Rosalind, I am sorry to say that the course of her true love ran by no means smoothly; the Frenchman had turned out to be not a marquess, but a billiard-marker; and a sad, sore subject the disappointment was with the neglected lady. We should have spoken of it long since, had the subject been  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6538-00000106"/> 206          GOOD -STORIES. one that was much canvassed- in the Gann family; but once when Gann had endeavored to rally his step-daughter on this unfortunate attachment (using for the purpose those delicate terms of wit for which the honest gentleman was always famous), Miss Linda had flown into such a violent fury, and comported herself in a way so dreadful, that James Gann, Esquire, was fairly frightened out of his wits by the threats, screams, and imprecations which she uttered. Miss Bella, who was disposed to be jocose likewise, was likewise awed into silence; for her dear sister talked of tearing her eyes out that minute, and uttered some hints, too, regarding love matters personally affecting Miss Bella herself, which caused that young lady to turn pale-red, to mutter something about '" wicked lies," and to leave the room immediately. Nor was the subject ever again broached by the Ganns. Even when Mrs. Gann once talked about that odious French impostor, she was stopped immediately, not by the lady concerned, but by Miss Bella, who cried, sharply, 'Mamma, hold your tongue, and don't vex our dear Linda by alluding to any such stuff." It is most probable that the young ladies had had a private conference, which, beginning a little fierce- ly at. first, had ended amicably: and so the marquess was mentioned no more. Miss Linda, then, was comparatively free (for Bob Smith, the linen-draper, and young Glauber, the apothecary, went for nothing); undo very luckily for her, a successor was found for the faithless Frenchman almost immediately. This gentleman was a commoner, to be sure; but had a good estate of five hundred a year kept his horse and gig, and was, as Mr. Gann remarked, as good a fellow as ever lived. Let us say at once that the new lover was no other than Mr. Swighy. From the day when he had been introduced to the family le appeared to be very much attracted by the two sisters; sent a turkey of his own farm, and six bottles of prime Hollands, to Mr. and Mrs. Gann, in presents; and, in ten short days after his first visit, had informed his friend Gann that he was violently in love with two women whose names he would never- never breathe. The worthy Gann,   A SHABBY GENTEEL- STORY.      -   27 knew right well how the matter was; for he had not failed to remark Swighy's melancholy, and to attribute it to its right cause. Swighy was forty-eight years of age, stout, hearty, gay, much given to drink, and had never been a lady's man, or, indeed, passed half a dozen evenings in ladies' society. He thought Gann the noblest and finest fellow in the world. He never heard any singing like James's, nor any jokes like his; nor had met with such-an ac- complished gentleman or man of the world. "Gann has his faults," Swighy would say at the Bag of Nails; ' which of us has not? - but I tell you what, he's the greatest trump I ever see." Many scores of scores had he paid for Gann, many guineas and crown- pieces had he lent him, since he came into his property some three years before. What were Swighy's former pursuits I can't tell. What need we care? Had n't he five hundred a year now, and a horse and gig? Ay, that he had. Since his accession to fortune, this gay younghachelor had taken his share (what he called 1s his whack ") of pleasure ; had been at one - nay, perhaps, at two - public-houses every night; and had been tipsy, I make no doubt, nearly a thousand times in the course of the three years. Many people had tried to cheat him; but, no, no! he knew what was what, and in all matters of money was simple and shrewd. Gann's gentility won him; his bragging, his ton, and the stylish tuft on his chin. To be invited to his house was a proud moment; and when he went away, after the banquet described in the last chapter, he was in a perfect ferment of love and liquor. "What a stylish woman is that Mrs. Gann!" thought he, as he tumbled into bed at hs inn: " fine she must have been as a-gal!- fourteen stone now, without saddle or bridle, and no mistake. And them Miss Macartys, Jupiter! what spanking, handsome, elegant creatures! - real elegance in both on 'em! Such hair! - black 's the word - as black as my mare; such cheeks, such necks, and shoulders!" At noon he repeated these observations to Gann him- self, as he walked up and down the pier with that gentleman, smok- ing Manilla cheroots. He was in raptures with his evening. Gann received his praises with much majestic good-humor.  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6538-00000107"/> 208         GOOD STORIES. "Blood, sir!" said he, " blood s everything! Them gals have been brought up as few ever have. I don't speak of myself; hbut their mother, - their mother 's a lady, sir. Show me a woman in England as is better bred or knows the world more than my Juli- ana!" It's impawsible," said Swighy. "Think of the company we 've kep', sir, before our misfortunes, - the fust in the land. Brandenburg House, sir, - England's injured queen. Law bless you! Juliana was always there." "I make no doubt, sir; you can see it in her," said Swighy, sol- emnly. a And as for those gals, why, ain't they related to the fust fami- lies in Ireland, sir? - In course they are. As I said before, blood's everything; and those young women have the best of it; they are connected with the regular old noblesse." "They have the best of everythink, I'm sure," said Swighy, "and deserve it, too," and relapsed into his morning remarks. "What creatures! what elegance! what hair and eyes, sir!- black, and all's black, as I say. What complexion, sir! - ay, and what makes, too! Such a neck and shoulders I never see!" Gann, who had his hands in his pockets (his friend's arm being hooked into one of his), here suddenly withdrew his liand firom its hiding-place, clenched his fist, assumed a horrible knowing grin, and gave Mr. Swighy such a blow in the ribs as wellnigh sent him into the water. "You sly dog!" said Mr. Gann, with inexpressible emphasis; " you've found that out, too, have you? Have a care, Joe, my boy, - have a care." And herewith Gann and Joe burst into tremendous roars of laughter, fresh explosions taking place at intervals of five minutes during the rest of the walk. The two friends parted exceedingly happy,; and when they met that evening at "The Nails"Gann drew Swighy mysteriously into :the bar, and thrust into his hand a triangular piece of pink paper, which the latter read: { Mrs. Gann and the Misses Macarty request the honor and pleas- *   / ' X" 6' t ' '"5 T-?iSPn A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          209 ure of Mr. Swighy's company (if you have no better engagement) to tea to-morrow evening, at half past five. "MARGARETTA COTTAGE, Salamanca Road North. Thursday evening." The faces of the two gentlemen were wonderfully expressive of satisfaction as this communication passed between them. And I am led to believe that Mrs. Gann had been unusually pleased with her husband's conduct on that day, for honest James had no; less than thirteen and sixpence in his pocket, and insisted, as usual, upon standing glasses all round. Joe Swrighy, left alone in the little par- lor behind the bar, called for a sheet of paper, a new pen, and a wafer, and in the space of half an hour concocted a very spirited and satisfactory answer to this note; which was carried off by Gann, and duly delivered. Punctually at half past five Mr. Joseph Swighy knocked at Margaretta Cottage door, in his new coat wittl glisteringo brass buttons, his face clean shaved, and his great ears shining over his great shirt-collar, delightfully bright and red. What happened at this tea-party it is needless here to say; but Swighy came away from it quite as much enchanted as before, and declared that the duets sung by the ladies in hideous discord were the sweetest music he had ever heard. He sent the gin and -the turkey the next day; and, of course, was invited to dine. The dinner was followed up on his part by ain offer to drive all the young ladies and their mamma into the countlry; and he hired a very smalrt barouche to conduct them. The invitation was not declined; and Fitch, too, was asked by Mr. Swighy, in the height of his good-humor, and accepted with the utmost delight. "Me and Joe will go on the box," said Gann. ' You four ladies and Mr. Fitch shall go inside. Carry must go bodkin; but she ain't very big." "Carry, indeed, will stop at home," said her mamma; "she's not fit to go out." At which poor Fitch's jaw fell; it was in order to ride with her Xo. 4.    14  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6538-00000108"/> 210     t-  -GOOD STORIES. that he had agreed to accompany the party; nor could he escape now, having just promised so eagerly. "O, don't let's have that proud Brandon," said the young ladies, when the good-natured Mr. Swighy proposed to ask that gentle- man; and therefore he was not invited to join them in their excur- sion; but he stayed at home very unconcernedly, and saw the barouche and its load drive off. Somebody else looked at it from the parlor window with rather a heavy heart, and that some one was poor Caroline. The day was bright and sunshiny; the spring was beginning early; it would have been pleasant to have been a lady for once, and to have driven along in a carriage with prancing horses. Mr. Fitch looked after her in a very sheepish, melancholy way; and was so dismal and silly during the first part of the jour- ney, that Miss Linda, who was next him, said to her papa that-she would change places with him; and actually mounted the box by the side of the happy, trembling Mr. Swighy. How proud he was, to be sure!, How knowingly did he spank the horses along, and fling out the shillings at the turnpikes! "Bless you, he don't care for change!" said Gann, as one of the toll-takers offered to render some coppers; and Joe felt infinitely obliged to his friend for setting off his amiable qualities in such a way. O mighty Fate, that over us miserable mortals rulest supreme, with what small means are thy ends effected! - with what scornful ease and mean instruments does it please thee to govern mankind! Let each man think of the circumstances of his life, and how its lot has been determined. The getting up a little earlier or later, the turning down this street or that, the eating of this dish or the other, may influence all the years and actions of a future life. Mankind walks down the left-hand side of Regent Street instead of the rilght, and meets a friend who asks him to dinner, and goes, and finds the turtle remarkably good, and the iced punch very cool and pleasant; and, being in a merry, jovial, idle mood, has no objection to a social rubber of whist, - nay, to a few more glasses of that - cool punch.

Or he. walks down the right-hand side of Regent Street instead of the left, and, good Heavens! who is that charming young creature who has just stepped into her car- riaoge from Mr. Fraser's shop, and to whom and her mamma Air. Fraser has made the most elegant bow in the world? It is the lovely Miss Moidore, with a hundred thousand pounds, who has remarked your elegant figure, and regularly drives to town on the first of the month, to purchase her darling Magazine. You drive after her as fast,as the hack-cab will carry you. She reads the Magazine the whole way. She stops at her papa's elegant villa at Hampsteacd, with a conservatory, a double coach-house, and a park- like paddock. As the lodge-gate separates you from that dear girl, she looks back just once, and blushes. Erubuit, salva est res. She has blushed, and you are all right. In a week you are introduced to the family, and pronounced a charming young fellow of high principles. In three weeks you have danced twenty-nine quadrilles with her, and whisked her through several miles of waltzes. In a month Mrs. O'Flaherty has flung herself into the arms of her moth- er, just having come from a visit to the village of Gretna, near Carlisle; and you have an account at your banker's ever after. What is the cause of all this good fortune?-a walk on a partiscu lar side of Regent Street. And so true and indisputable is this fact, tlhat there's a young north-country gentleman with whom I am acquainted, that daily paces up and down the above-named street for many hours, fully expecting that such an adventure will happen to him; for which end he keeps a cab in readiness at the corner of Vigo Lane. Now, after a dissertation in this history, the reader is pretty sure to know that a moral is coming; and the facts connected with our tale, which are to be drawn from the above little essay on fate, are simply these: -1. If Mr; Fitch had not heard Mr. Swighy invite all the ladies, hle would have refused Swighy's invitation, and stayed at home. 2.

If he had not been sulky, she never would have asked her papa to let her take his place kn the box. 4. If she had not taken her papa's place on the box, not one of the circumstances would have happened which did happen; and which were as follows                       - 1. Miss Bella remained inside. 2. Mr. Swighy, who was wavering between the two, like a certain animal between two bundles of hay, was determined by this circumstance, and made proposals to Miss Linda, whispering to Miss Linda: Miss, H ain't equal to the like of you; but I'm hearty, healthy, and have five hundred a year. Will you marry me?  In fact, this very speech had been taught him by cunning Gann, who saw well enough that Swighy would speak to one or other of his daughters. And to it the young lady replied, also in a wrlispering, agitated tone, "Law, Mr. S.! Wllat- an odd man! How can you?  And, after a little pause, added, "Speak to mamma." 3. (And this is the main point of my story.) If little Caroline had been allowed to go out, she never would have been left alone with Brandon at Margate. Whlen Fate wills that something should come to pass, she sends forth a million of little circumstances to clear and prepare the way. In the month of April (as indeed in half a score of other months of the year) the reader may have remarked that the cold northeast wind is prevalent; and that when, tempted by a glimpse of sun- "ine, he issues forth to take the air, he receives not only it, but such a quantity of it as is enough to keep him shivering through the rest of the miserable month. On one of these happy days of Eng- lish weather (it was the very day before the pleasure party described in the last chapter) Mr. Brandon, cursing heartily his country, and thinking how infinitely more congenial to him were, the winds and habits prevalent in other nations, was marching over the cliffs near Margate, in the midst of a storm of shrill east wind which no ordinary mortal could bear, when he found perched on the cliff, his fingers blue with cold, the celebrated Andrea Fitch,   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          213. employed in sketching a land or a sea scape on a sheet of gray paper. ' You have chosen a fine day for sketching," said Mr. Brandon, bitterly, his thin aquiline nose peering out livid from the fur collar of his coat. Mr. Fitch smiled, understanding the allusion. "An hartist, sir," said he, 'dosn't mind the coldness of the weather. There was a chap in the Academy who took sketches twenty degrees below zero in Hiceland,- Mount 'Ecla, sir! E was the man that gave the first hidea of Mount 'Ecla for the Surrey Zoological Gardens." '-' He must have been a wonderful enthusiast!" said Mr. Bran- don; "I fivaicy that most would prefer to sit at home, and not numb their fingers in such a freezing storm as this!" "Storm, sir!" replied Fitch, majestically; "I live in a storm, sir! A  true hartist is never so 'appy as when he can have the advantage to gaze upon yonder tempestuous hocean in one of its hangry moods." Ay, there comes the steamer," answered Mr. Brandon; "I can fancy that there are a score of unhappy people on board who are not artists, and would wish to behold your ocean quiet.' ' They are not poets, sir: the glorious hever-changing expression of the great countenance of Nature is not seen by them. I should consider myself unworthy my hart, if I could not bear a little priva- tion of cold or 'eat for its sake. And besides, sir, whatever their hardships may be, such a sight hamply repays me; for, although my private sorrows may be (has they are) tremendous, I never can look abroad upon the green hearth and hawful sea, without in a measure forgetting my personal woes and wrongs; for what right has a poor creature like me to think of his affairs in the presence of such a spectacle as this? I can't, sir; I feel ashamed of myself; I bow my 'ead and am quiet. When I   set myself to examining hart, sir (by which I mean nature), I don't dare to think of anything else." "You worship a very charming and consoling mistress," answered Mr. Brandon, with a   supercilious air, lighting and beginning to smoke- a  ciear: " vour enthusinasm rfnPq tr nnrarl; -1  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6538-00000110"/> 214s         GOOD STORIES. "'If you have another," said Andrea Fitch, "I should like to smoke one, for you seem - to have a real feeling about hart, and I was a getting so deucedly cold here, that really there was scarcely any bearing of it." "The cold is very severe," replied Mr. Brandon. "No, no, it's not the weather, sir!" said Mr. Fitch; "it's here, sir, here " (pointing to the left side of his waistcoat). "What! you, too, have had sorrows?" "Sorrows, sir! hagonies - hagonies, which I have never un- folded to any mortal! I have hendured halmost heverything, pov- erty, sir, 'unger, hobloquy, 'opeless love! but for my hart, sir, I should be the most miserable wretch in the world!" And herewith Mr. Fitch began to pour forth into Mr. Brandon's ears the history of some of those sorrows under which he labored, and which he communicated to every single person who would lis- ten to him. Mr. Brandon was greatly amused by Fitch's prattle, and the latter told him under what privations he had studied his art: how he had starved for three years in Paris and Rome, while laboring at his profession; how meanly jealous the Royal Academy was, which would never exhibit a single one of his pictures; how he had been driven from the Heternal City by the attentions of an immense, fat Mrs. Carrickfergus, who absolutely proposed marriage to him; and how he was at this moment (a fact of which Mr. Brandon was already quite aware) madly and desperately in love with one of the most beautiful maidens in this world. For Fitch, having a mistress to his heart's desire, was boiling with impatience to have a confidant; what, indeed, would be the joy of love, if one were not allowed to speak of one's feelings to a friend who could know how to sy patie  wi  them?   Fitch was sure Brandon did, because Branon was the very first person with whom  the painter had talked since he Ad come to the resolution recorded in the last chapter. "I hope she is as rich as that unlucky Mrs. Carrickfergus, whom you treated so cruelly?" said the confidant, affecting entire igno- *rance.   -0 A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY. E          2^9  ^ "Rich, sir? no, I thank Heaven, she has not a penny!" said Fitch. "I presume, then, you are yourself independent," said Brandon, smiling, " for in the marriage state, one or the other of the parties concerned should bring a portion of the filthy lucre?" "Have n't I my profession, sir?" said Fitch, majestically, having declared five minutes before that he starved in his profession. "Do you suppose a painter gets nothing? Have nt I borders from the first people in Europe? commissions, sir, to hexecute 'istory- pieces, battle-pieces, haltar-pieces?" "Masterpieces, I am sure," said Brandon, bowing politely; " for a gentleman of your astonishing genius can do no other." The delighted artist received this compliment with many blushes, and vowed and protested that his performances were not really worthy of such high praise; but he fancied Mr. Brandon a great connoisseur, nevertheless, and unburdened his mind to him in a manner still more open. Fitch's sketch was by this time finished; and, putting his drawing implements together, he rose, and the gen- tlemen walked away.  The sketch was hugely admired by Mr. Brandon, and when they came home, Fitch, culling it dexterously out of his book, presented it in a neat speech to his friend, "the gifted hamateur." "The gifted hamateur " receivted the drawing with a profusion of thanks, and so muchl did he value it, that he had actually torn off a piece to light a cigar with, when he saw that words were written on the other side of the paper, and deciphered the following:- "SONG OF THE VIOLET. "A humble flower long time I pined, Upon the solitary plain, And trembled at the angry wind, And shrunk before the bitter rain. And, oh!

"It draws the fragrance from my leaves, It robs me of my sweetest breath; And every time it falls and heaves, It warns me of my coming death.. But one I know would glad forego All joys of life to be as I; An hour to rest on that sweet breast, And then, contented die. "ANDREA." When Mr. Brandon had finished the perusal of these verses, he laid them down with an air of considerable vexation. (' Egad!" said he, "this fellow, fool as he is, is not so great a fool as he seems; and if he goes on this way, may finish by turning the girl's head. They can't resist a. man if he but presses hard enough, -I know they can't!" And here Mr. Brandon mused over his various experience, which confirmed his observation, that be a man ever so silly, a gentlewoman will yield to him out of sheer weariness. And he thought of several cases in which, by the persevering application of copies of verses, young ladies had been broughlt from dislike to sufferance of a man, from sufferance to partiality, and from par- tiality to St. George's, Hanover Square.  "A ruffian who mur- ders his h's to carry off such a delicate little creature as that!" cried he in a transport: " it shall never be if I can prevent it!" He thought Caroline more and more beautiful every instant, and was himself by this time almost as much in love with her as Fitch himself. Mr. Brandon, then, saw Fitch depart in Swighy's carriage with no ordinary feelings of pleasure. Miss Caroline was not with them. 'Now is my time!" thought Brandon; and, ringing the bell, he   A SHABB^Y GENTEEL STORY.         217 inquired with. some anxiety, from Becky, where Miss Caroline was? It must be confessed that mistress and maid were at their usual occupation, working and reading novels in the back-parlor. Poor Carry! what other pleasure had she? She had not gone through many pages, or Becky advanced many stitches in the darning of that table-cloth which the good housewife, Mrs. Gann, had confided/to her charge, when an humble knock was heard at the door of the sitting-room, that caused the blushing Caroline to tremble and drop her book, as Miss Lydia Languish does in the play. Mr. George Brandon entered with a very demure air. He held in his hand a black satin neck-scarf, of which a part had come to be broken. He could not wear it in its present condition, that was evident; but Miss Caroline was blushing and trembling a great deal too much to suspect that this wicked Brandon had himself torn his own scarf with his own hands one moment before he- entered the room. I don't know whether Becky had any suspicions of this fact, or whether it was only the ordinalry roguish look which she had when anything pleased her, that now lighted up her eyes and caused her mouth to expand smilingly, and her fat, red cheeks to gather up into wrinkles. "I have had a sad misfortune," said he, " and should be very much obliged indeed to Miss Caroline to repair it." (Caroline was said with a kind of tender hesitation that caused the young woman, so named, to blush more than ever.) s It is the only stock I have in the world, and I can't go bare-necked into the streets; can I, Mrs. Becky?" - No, sure," said Becky. "Not unless I was a celebrated painter, like Mr. Fitch," added Mr. Brandon, with a, smile, which was reflected speedily upon the face of the lady whom he wished to interest. "Those great geni- uses," he added, L may do anything." c For," says Becky, 4hee's got enough beard on hees faze to keep hees neck warm!"At which remark, though Miss Caroline very properly said, "For shame, Becky!"Mr. Brandon was so  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6538-00000112"/> 218&amp;         GOOD ST1ORIES.-    - convulsed with laughter, that he fairly fell down upon the sofa on which Miss Caroline was seated. How she startled and trembled, ,as he flung his arm upon the back of the couch! Mr. Brandon did not attempt to apologize for what was an act of considerable imper- tinence, but continued mercilessly to make many more jokes con- cerning poor Fitch, which were so cleverly suited to the comprehen- sion of the maid and the young mistress, as to elicit a great number of roars of lauglhter from the one, and to cause the other to smile in spite of herself. Indeed, Brandon had gained a vast reputation with Becky in his morning colloquies with her, and she was ready to laugh at any single word which it pleased him to utter. How many of his good things had this honest scullion carried down stairs to Caroline? and how pitiliessly had she contrived to estropier them in their passage from the drawing-room to the kitchen? Well, then, while Mr. Brandon " was a-going on," as Becky said, Caroline had taken his stock, and her little fingers were occupied in repairing the damage he had done to it. Was it clumsiness on her part? Certain it is that the rent took several minutes to repair; of them the mangeur des ceurs did not fail to profit, con- versing in an easy, kindly, confidential way, which set our fluttering heroine speedily at rest, and enabled her to reply to his continual queries, addressed with much adroitness and an air of fraternal inter- est, by a number of those pretty, little, timid, whispering yeses and noes, and those gentle, quick looks of the eyes, wherewith young and modest maidens are wont to reply to the questions of seducing young bachelors. Dear yeses and noes, how beautiful you are when gently whispered by pretty lips! - glances of quick innocent eyes, how charming are you! - and how charming the soft blush that steals over the cheek, towards which the dark lashes are draw- ing the full blue-veined eyelids down. And here let the writer of this solemnly declare upon his veracity, that he means nothing but what is right and moral. But look, I pray you, at an innocent, bashful girl, of sixteen: if she be but good, she must be pretty. She is a woman now, but a girl still. fEow delightful all her ways are! How exquisite her instinctive grace! All the arts of all the   A SHABBY G"ENTEEL STORY.         2419- Cleopatras are not so captivating as her nature. Who can resist her confiding simplicity, or fail to - be touched and conquered by her gentle appeal to protection? All this Mr. Brandon saw and felt, as many a gentleman educated in this school will. It is not because a man is a rascal himself, that he cannot appreciate virtue and purity very keenly; and our hero did feel for this simple, gentle, tender, artless creature a real respect and sympathy, --a sympathy so fresh and delicious, that he was but too glad to yield to it, and indulge in it, and which he mis- took, probably, for a real love of virtue, and a return to the days of his innocence. Indeed, Mr. Brandon, it was no such thing. It was only because vice and debauch were stale for the moment, and this pretty virtuel new. It was only because your cloyed appetite was long unused to this simple meat that you felt so keen a relish for it; and I thought of you only the last blessed Saturday, at Mr. Lovegrove's West India Tavern, Blackwall, where a company of fifteen epicures, who had scorned the turtle, pooh-poohed the punch, and sent away the whitebait, did suddenly and simultaneously make a rush upon - a dish of beans and bacon. And if the assiduous reader of novels will think upon some of the most celebrated works of that species, which have lately appeared in this and other countries, he will find, amidst much debauch of sentiment, and enervating dissipation of intellect, that the writers have from time to time a returning appe- tite for innocence and freshness, and indulge us with occasional repasts of beans and bacon. How long Mr. Brandon remained by Miss Caroline's side I have no means of judging; it is probable, however, that he stayed a much longer time than was necessary for the mending of his black satin stock. I believe, indeed, that he read to the ladies a great part of the Mysteries of Udolpho, over which they were engaged; and interspersed his reading with many remarks of his own, both tender and satirical. Whether he was in her company half an hour or four hours, this is certain, that the time slipped away very swiftly with poor Caroline; and when- a carriage drove up to the door, and shrill voices were heard crying,-  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6538-00000113"/> 220         GOOD STOaRIES. "Becky!" * Carry!" and Rebecca, the maid, starting up, cried, ' Lor', here's missus!" and Brandon jumped rather suddenly otf the sofa, and fled up the stairs, - when all these events took place, I know Caroline felt very sad indeed, and opened the door for her parents with a very heavy heart. Swighy helped Miss Linda off the box with excessive tenderness. Papa was bustling and roaring in high good-bumor, and called for "hot water and tumblers immediately." Mrs. Gann was gracious; and Miss Bell sulky, as she had good reason to be, for she insisted upon taking the front seat in the carriage before her sister, and had lost a husband by that very piece of obstinacy. Mr. Fitch, as he entered, bestowed upon Caroline a heavy sigh and a deep stare, and silently ascended to his own apartment. He was lost-in thought. The fact is, he was trying to remember some verses regarding a violet, which he had made five years before, any which he had somehow lost from among his papers. So he went up stairs, muttering, - "A humble flower long since I pined Upon a solitary plain - " A. CHAPTER      VI. DESCRIBES A SHABBY GENTEEL MARRIAGE, AND MORE LOVE- -MAKING. IT will not be necessary to describe the particulars of the festivi- ties which took place on the occasion of Mr. Swighy's marriage to Miss Macarty. The happy pair went off in a post-chaise and four to the bridegroom's country-seat, accompanied by the bride's blushing sister; and when the first week of their matrimonial bliss was ended, that worthy woman, Mrs. Gann, with her excellent hius- band, went to visit the young couple. Miss Caroline was left,   A SHABBY -GENTEEL STORY.         221 therefore, sole mistress of the house, and received especial cautions froml her mamma as to prudence, economy, the'proper management of the lodgers' bills, and the necessity of staying at home. Considering that one of the gentlemen remaining in the -house was a declared lover of Miss Caroline, I think it is a little surpris- ing that her mother should leave her unprotected; but in this mat- ter the poor are not so particular as the rich; and so this young lady was consigned to the guardianship of her own innocence, and the lodgers' loyalty; nor was there any reason why Mrs. Gann should doubt the latter. As for Mr. Fitch, he would have far pre- ferred to be torn to pieces by ten thousand wild horses, rather than to offer to the youngr woman any unkindness or insult; and how was Mrs. Gann to suppose that her other lodger was a whit less loyal? that hle had any partiality for a person of whom he always spoke as of a mean, insignificant little baby? So, without any misgivings, and in a one-horse fly with Mr. Gann by her side, with a bran-new green coat and gilt buttons, Juliana Gann went forth to visit her beloved child, and console her in her married state. And here, were I allowed to occupy the reader with extraneous matters I could give a very curious and touching picture of the Swighy menage. Mrs. S., I am very sorry to say, quarrelled with her husband on the third day after their marriage, - and for what, prythee? Why, because he would smoke, and no gentleman ought to smoke. Swighy, therefore, patiently resigned his pipe, and with it one of the quietest, happiest, kindest companions of his solitude. He was a different man after this; his pipe was as a limb of his body. Having on Tuesday conquered the pipe, Mrs. Swighy on Thursday did battle with her husband's rum-and-water, a drink of an odious smell, as she very properly observed; and the smell was doubly odious, now that the tobacco-smoke no longer perfumed the parlor-breeze, and counteracted the odors of the juice of West India sugar-canes., On Thursday, then, Mr. Swihrghy and rum held out pretty bravely. Mrs. S. attacked the punch with some sharp-shoot- ing, and fierce charges of vulgarity; to which S. replied, by opens ing the battery of oaths (chiefly directed to his own eyes, however),  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6538-00000114"/> 222         GOOD STORIES. and loud protestations that he would never surrender. - In three days more, however, the rum-and-water was gone. Mr. Swighy, defeated and prostrate, had given up that stronghold; his youngo wife and sister were triumphant;. and his poor mother, who occu- pied her son's house, and lhad till now taken her place at the head of his table, saw that her empire was forever lost, and was prepar- ing suddenly to succumb to the imperious claims of the mistress of the mansion. All this, I say, I wish I had the liberty to describe at large, as also to narrate the arrival of majestic Mrs. Gann; and a battle- royal which speedily took place between the two worthy mothers- in-law. Noble is the hatred of ladies who stand in this relation to each other; each sees what injury the other is inflicting upon her darling child; each mistrusts, detests, and to her offspring privily abuses the arts and crimes of the other. A house with a wife is often warm enough; a house with wife and mother is rather warmer than any spot on the known globe; a house with two mothers-in-law is so excessively hot, that it can be likened to no place on earth at all, but one must go lower for a simile. Think of a wife who despises her husband, and teaches him manners; of an elegant sister, who joins in rallying him (this was almost the only point of union between Bella and Linda now, - for since the marriage, Linda hated her sister consumedly). Think, I say, of two mothers-in-law, -one, large, pompous, and atrociously genteel; another coarse and shrill, determined not to have her son put upon,-and you may see what a happy fellow Joe Swighy was, and into what a piece of good luck he had fallen. What would have become of him  without his father-in-law. Indeed, one shudders to think; but the consequence of that gentle- man's arrival and intervention was speedily this: - About four o'clock, when the dinner was removed, and the quarrelling used commonly to set in, the two gents took their hats, and sallied out; and as one has found when the body is inflamed that the applica- tion of a stringent medicine may cause the ill to disappear for a while, only to returieahere with greater force in like manner   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.         - 22-83 Mrs. Swighy's sudden victory over the pipe and rum-and-water, although it had caused a temporary cessation of the evil of which she complained, was quite unable to stop it altogether; it disap- peared from one spot only to rage with more violence elsewhere. In Swighy's parlor, rum and tobacco odors rose no more (except, indeed, when Mrs. Gann would partake of the former as a restora- tive) ; but if you could have seen the Half-Moon and Snuffers down the village; if you could have seen the good dry skittle-ground which stretched at the back of that inn, and the window of the back parlor which superintended that skittle-ground; if the hour at which you beheld these objects was evening, what time the rustics from their toils released, trolled the stout ball amidst the rattling pins (the oaken pins that standing in the sun did cast long shadows on the golden sward); if you hadl remarked all this, I say, you would have also seen in the back parlor a tallow candle twinkling in the shade, and standing on a little greasy table. Upon the greasy table was a pewter porter-pot, and to the left a teaspoon glittering in a glass of gin; close to each of these two delicacies was a pipe of tobacco; and behind the, pipes sat Mr. Gann and Mr. Swighy, who now made the Half-Moon and Snuffers their usual place of resort, and forgot their married cares. In spite of all our promises of brevity, these things have taken some space to describe; and the reader must also know that some short interval elapsed ere they occurred. A month at least passed away before Mr. Swighy had decidedly taken up his position at the little inn; all this time, Gann was staying with his son-in-law, at the latter's most earnest request; and Mrs. Gann remained under the same roof at her own desire. Not the hints of her daughter, nor the broad questions of the dowager Mrs. Swighy, could induce honest Mrs. Gann to stir from her quarters. She had had her lodgers' money in advance, as was the worthy woman's custom; she knew Margate in April was dreadfully dull, and she determined to enjoy the country until the jovial town season arrived. The Canterbury coachman, whom Gann knew, and who passed through the village, used to take her cargo of novels to and fro; and the old  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6538-00000115"/> lady made herself as happy as circumstances would allow. Should anything of importance occur during her mammals absence, Caro- line was to make use of the same conveyance, and inform Mrs. Gann in a letter. Miss Caroline looked at her papa and mamma, as the vehicle which was to bear them to the newly married couple moved up the street; .but, strange to say, she did not feel that heaviness of heart which she before had experienced when forbidden to share the fes- tivities of her family, but was on this occasion more happy than any one of them, - so happy, that the young woman felt quite ashamed of herself; and Becky- was fain to remark how her mistress's cheek flushed, and her eye sparkled (and turned perpetually to the door), and her whole little frame was in a flutter. "I wonder if he will come," said the little heart; and the eyes turned and looked at that well-known sofa-corner, whelre he had been placed a fortnight before. He looked exactly lilke Lord Byron, that he did, with his pale brow, and his slim bare neck; only not half so wicked, - no, no. She was sure that her - her Mr. Br.- her Bran- her George, was as good as he was beautiful. Don't let us be angry with her for calling him George; the girl was bred in an humble sentimental school; she did not know enou gh of soci- ety to be squeamish ; she never thought that she could be his really, and gave way in the silence of her fancy to,.the full extent of her affection for him. She had not looked at the door above twenty-five times that is to say, her parents had not quitted the house ten minutes-when sure enough, the latch did rattle, the door opened, and with a faint blush on his cheek divine George entered. He was going to make some excuse, as on the former occasion ; but he looked first into Caroline's face, which was beaming with joy and smiles; and the little thing, in return, regarded him, and - made room for him on the sofa.  O, sweet instinct of love! Brandon had no need of excuses, but sat down, and talked away as .easily, happily, and confi- dentially, and neither took any note of time. Andrea Fitch (the sly dog! ) witnessed the Gann departure with feelings of exultation, ,    X1  Q "l AJOJi J  AL  AJU. T A JA Ul - U J I J J1 L t A , =*i and had laid some deep plans of his own with regard to Miss Caro- line. So strong was his confidence in his friend on the-first floor, that Andrea actually descended to those apartments, on his way to Mrs. Gann's parlor, in order to consult Mr. Brandon, and make known to him his plan of operations. It would have made your heart break, or, at the -verv least, your sides ache, to behold the countenance of poor Mr. Fitch, as he thrust his bearded head in at the door of the parlor. There was Brandon lolling on the sofa, at his ease; Becky in full good humor; and Caroline, always absurdly inclined to blush, blushing at Fitch's appearance more than ever! She could not help looking from himi slyly and gently into the face of Mr. Brandon. That gentleman saw the look, and did not fail to interpret it. It was a confession of love, - an appeal for protection. A thrill of delightful vanity shot through Brandon's frame, and made his heart throb, as he noticed this look of poor Caroline. He answered it with one of his own tlat was cruelly wrong, cruelly triumphant, and sarcastic- and he shouted out to Mr. Fitch, with a loud, disconcerted tone, which only made that youngr painter feel more awkward than-ever he had been. Fitch made some clumsy speech regarding his din- ner, - whether that meal was to be held, in the absence of the parents, at the usual hour, and then took his leave. The poor fellow had been pleasing himself with the notion of taking this daily meal tete-a-tete with Caroline. What progress would he make in her heart during the absence of her parents! Did it not seem as if the first marriage had been arranged on pur- pose to facilitate his own? He determined thus his plan of cam- paign. He would make, in the first place, the most beautiful draw- ing of Caroline that ever was seen. "The conversations I'll 'ave with her during the sittings," says hle," will carry me a pretty long way; the drawing itself will be so beautiful, that she can't resist that. I'll write her verses in her halbum, and make designs hallusive of my passion for her." And so our pictorial Alnaschar dreamed and dreamed.

Lady Fitch, Sir Andrew Fitch, the Presgi- dent's chain, - all sorts of bright visions oted before his iagi- nation; and as Caroline was the first precious condition of his pre- ferment, he determined forthwith to begin, and realize that. But, O disappointment! on coming down to dinner t three. O'clock to that charming tete-a-tAte, he found no less than four cov- ers laid on the table, 'liss Caroline blushing, (according to custom) at the head of it; Becky, the maid, grinning at the foot; and Mr. Brandon, sitting quietly on one side, as much at home, forsooth, as if he had held that position for a year. The fact is, that the moment after Fitch retired, Brandon, inspired byjealousy, had made the same request which had been brought forward by the painter; nor must the la dies be too angry with Caro- line, if, after some scruples and struggles, she yielded to the propo- sal. Remember that the girl was the daughter ofa boalding-housea keeper, accustomed to continual dealins8 with her mamma's lodgers, and up to the present moment thinking herself as safe among them as the young person who awalked throuah Ireland with a bright goldl wand, in the scene of Mr. Thomas Moore. On the point, however of Brandon's admission, it must be confessed, for Caoline's honor, that she did hesitate. She felt that she entertained very different feelings towards him to those with which any other lodger or man had inspired her, and made a little movement of resistance at first But the poor girl's modesty overcame this, as well as her wish. Ought she to avoid him?  Ought she not to stifle an er d0'U'  IL osil   n preference which she might feel towards him, and act towards him with the same indifference which she would show' to any other person in a like situation? Was not Mr. Fitch to dine at table as usual, and had she refused him?  So reasoned she in her heart. Silly, little, un- ning heart! it knew that all these reasons were lies, and that she should avoid the man; but she was willing to afe text for meeting, and so made a kind of compromise with her con-   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.        3    ' science. Dine he should; but Becky should dine too, and be a protector to her. Becky laughed loudly at the idea of this, and toolk her place with huge delight. It is needless to say a word about this dinner, as we have already described a former meal; suffice it to say, that the presence of Brandon caused the painter to be excessively sulky and uncomfort- able; and so gave his rival, who was gay, triumphant, and at his ease, a decided advantage over him. Nor did Brandon neglect to use this to the utmost. When Fitch retired to his own apartments, -not jealous as yet, for the simple fellow believed every word of Brandon's morning conversation with him, -but vaguely annoyed and disappointed, Brandon assailed him with all the force of ridi- cule; at all his manners, words, looks, he joked mercilessly; laughed at his low birth (Miss Gann, be it remembered, had been taught to pique herself upon her own family), and invented a series of stories concerning his past life, which made the ladies - for  Becky, being in the palrlor, must be considered as sutch - conceive the greatest contempt and pity for the poor painter. After this, Mr. Braridon would expatiate with much eloquence upon lis own superior attractions and qualities. He talked of his cousin Lord So-and-so, with the easiest air imaginable; told Caroline what princesses he had danced with at foreign- courts; frightened her with accounts of dreadful duels he had fought; in a word, 11 posed " before her as a hero of the most sublime kind. How the poor little thing drank in all his tales; and how she and Becky (for they now occupied the same bedroom) talked over them at night! Miss Caroline, as Mr. Fitch has already stated, had in her pos- session, like almost every young lady in England, a little square book called an album, containing prints from annuals-; hideous designs of flowers; old pictures of faded fashions, cut out and pasted into the leaves; and small scraps of verses selected from Byron, Landon, or Mrs. Heerans; and written out in the girlish hand of the owner of the book. Brandon looked over this work with a good deal of curiosity,-for he contended, always, that a girl's disposi L lda -  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6538-00000117"/> tion might be learned from the character of this museum of hers, - and found here several sketches by Mr. Fitch, for which, before that gentleman had declared his passion for her, Caroline had beo-ged. These sketches the sentimental painter had illustrated with poetry, which,I must confess, Caroline thought charming, until now, when Mr. Brandon took occasion to point out how wretchedly poor the verses were (as indeed was the fact), and to parody them all. He was not unskilful at this kind of exercise, and at the drawing of caricatures, and had soon made a dozen of both parodies and draw- ings, which reflected cruelly upon the person and the talents of the painter. What now did this wicked Mr. Brandon do?  He, in the first place, drew a caricature of Fitch; and, secondly, having gone to a gardener's near the town, and purchased there a bunch of violets, he presented them  to Miss Caroline, and wrote Mr. Fitch's own verses before given into her album. He signed them with his own initials, and thus declared open war with the painter. CHAPTER VII. WHCH BRINGS A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO MARGATE BY THE STEAMBOAT. THE events which this history records began in the month of February.  Time had now  passed, and April had arrived, and with it that festive season so loved by school-boys, and called the Easter holidays. Not only school-boys, but men, profit by this period of leisure, - such men, especially, as have just come into enjoyment of their own cups and saucers, and are in daily expec- tation of their whiskers, - college men, I mean, -who are persons more anxious than any others to designate tlhemselves and each other by the manly title.

And whither do you think this wor- thy pair of young gentlemen were bound? To no less a place than Margate; for Cinqbars was filled with a longing to go and see his old friend Brandon, and determined to use his own elegant words, "to knock the old buck up." There was no adventure of consequence on board the steamer which brought Lord Cinqbars and his friend from London to Mar- gate, and very few passengers besides. A wandering Jew or two were set down at Gravesend; the Rev. Mr. Wackerbart, and six unhappy little pupils whom the reverend gentleman had pounced upon in London, and was carrying back to his academy near Herne Bay; some of those inevitable persons of dubious rank who seem to have free tickets, and always eat and drink hugirely with the cap- tain; and a lady and her party, formed the whole list of passengers.

I need not say what a large Class this is. Well; this fat lady had a courier, a tall whiskered man, who spoke all languages, looked a field-marshal, went by the name of Donnerwetter, and rode on the box; a French maid, Mademoiselle Augustine; and a little black page, called Saladin, who rode in the rumble. Saladin's whole business was to attend a wheezy, fat, white poodle, who usually travelled inside with his mistress, and her fair compagnon de voyage, whose name was Miss Runt. She was evidently a person of distinction. This fat lady, during the first part of the voyage, on a windy, sunshiny April day, paced the deck stoutly, leaning on the arm of poor little Miss Runt; and after they had passed Gravesend, whlen the-vessel began to pitch a good deal, retired to her citadel, the travelling-chariot, to and from which the steward, the stewardess, and the whiskered courier were con- tinually running with supplies, of sandwiches first, and afterwards of very hot brandy-and-water; for the truth must be told, it was rather a rough afternoon, and the poodle was sick ; Saladin was as bad; the French maid, like all French maids, was outrageously ill; the lady herself was very unwell indeed; and poor, dear, sympathizing Runt was qualmish. "Ah, Runt!" would the fat lady say in the intervals, " what a thing this malady de mare is! O mongjew O - O!" "It is, indeed, dear madam," said Runt, and went O -0 - in chorus.

Agreat deal more of this kind of conversation took place during the voyage; but as it occurred inside a carriage, so that to hear it was very difficult, and as possibly it'was not of that edifying nature which would induce the reader to relish many chapters of it, we shall give no further account of the ladies'talk: suffice it to say, that about half past four o'clock the journey ended, by the vessel bringing up at Margate Pier. The passengers poured forth, and hied to their respective homes, or inns. My Lord Cinqbars and his companion (of whom we have said nothing, -as tleyv on their sides had scarcely spoken a word the whole way, except "deuce- ace," " quater-tray," i sizes" and so on,-being occupied cease- lessly in drinking bottled stout, and playing backgammon), ordered their luggage to be conveyed to Wri ht's Hotel, twhither the fat lady and suite followed them. The house was vacant, and the best rooms, in it were placed, of course, at the service of the new- comers. The fat lady sailed out of her bedroom- towards her saloon, just as Lord Cinqbars, cigar in mouth, was swragrgering out of his parlor. They met in the passage; when to the young lord's surprise, the fat lady dropped him a low courtesy, and said:- NMunseer le Vecomte de Cinqbars, sharmy de vous voir.

Lord Cinqbars stared her in the face, and pushed by her without a word, leaving the fat lady rather disconcerted. "Well, Runt, I'm sure," said she, " he need not be so proud; I've met him twenty times at Rome, when he was a young chap with his tutor." - Who the devil can that fat foreigner be?" muse&amp;Lord Cinq- bars. "Hang her, I've seen her somewhere; but I'n cursed if I understand a word of her jabber." And so, dismissing the subject, he walked on to Brandon's.  6 Dang, it, it's a strange thing!" said the landlord of the hotel; "but both my lord and the fat woman in number nine have asked their way to Mother Gann's lodging," - for so did hle dare to call that respectable woman-!   A SHABBY- GENTEEL STORY.         28 * .  It was true: as soon as number nine had eaten her dinner, she asked the question mentioned by the landlord and, as this meal occupied a considerable time, the shades of evening had by this time fallen upon the quiet city; the silver moon lighted up tle- bay, and, supported by a numerous and well-appoin ted train of gas lamps, illuminated the streets of a town, - of autumn eves so crowded and so gay; of gusty April nights, so desolate. At this still hour (it might be half past seven), two ladies passed the gates of Wright's Hotel, "in shrouding mantle wrapped, and velvet cap." Up the deserted High Street toiled they, by-gaping rows of empty bathing- houses, by melancholy Jolly's French bazaar, by mouldy pastry- cooks, blank reading-rooms, by fishmongers who never sold a fish, mercers who vended not a yard of ribbon, -because, as yet; the season was not come, and Jews and Cockneys still remained in town. At High Street's corner, near to Hawley Square, they passed the house of Mr. Fincham, chemist, who doth not only heathful drugs supply, but likewise sells cigars,-the worst cigars that ever mortal man gave threepence for. Up to this point, I say, I have had a right to accompany the fat lady and Miss Runt; but whether, on arriving at Mr. Fincham's, they turned to the left, in the direction of the Royal Hotel, or to the right, by the beach, the bathing-machines, and queer, rickety old row of houses, called Buenos Ayres, no power on earth shall in- duce me to say; suffice it, they went to Mrs. Gann's. Why should we set all the world gadding to a particular street, to know where that lady lives? They arrived before that lady's house at about eight o'clock. Every house in the street had bills on it except hel's, (bitter mockery, as if anybody came down at Easter!) and at Mrs. Gann's house there was a light in the garret, and another in the- two-pair front. I believe I have not mentioned before, that all the front windows were bow or bay windows; but so much the reader may know. The two ladies, who had walked so far, examined wistfully the plate on the door, stood on the steps for a short times retreated; and conversed with one another.  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6538-00000120"/> ' O Runty!" said the stouter of the two, he 's here, - I know he's here, mong cure le dee, - my heart tells me so." - And she put a large hand upon a place on her left side, where there once had been a waist. "Do you think he loolks front or back, dear?" asked Runt. ( P'laps he's not at home." "That - that's his croisy" said the stout person: "I know it is"; and she pointed with instinctive justice to the two-pair. "Ecouty!" she added,"lhe's coming; there's some one at that window. O mong jeiv mongjew! -c'est Andre', c'est lu!" The moon was shining full on the face of the bow-windows of Mrs. Gann's house; and the two fair spies, who were watching on the other side, were, in consequence, completely in shadow. As the lady said, a dark form was seen in the two-pair front; it paced the room for a while, for no blinds were drawn. It then flung itself on a chair; its head on its hands; it then began to beat its brows wildly, and paced the room again. Ahl! how the fat lady's heart throbbed as she looked at all this! She gave a piercing shriek,- almost fainted! and little Ruln1's knees trembled under her, as with all her might she supported, or rather pushed up, the falling figure of her stollt patroness,-- who saw at that instant Fitch come to the candle with an immense pistol in his hand, and give a most horrible grin as he looked at it, and clasped it to his breast. a Unhand me, Runt; he's going to kill himself! It's for me! I know it is,- I will go to him! Andrea, my Andrea!" And the fat lady was pushing for the opposite side of the way, when sudden- ly the second-floor window went clattering up, and Fitches pale head was thrust out. He had heard a scream, and had possibly been induced to open the window in consequence; but by the time he had opened it he had forgotten everything, and put his head vacantly out of the win- dow, and gazed, the moon shining cold on his pale featulres. "Pallid horb!" said Fitch, "shall I ever see thy light again?- Will another night see me on this hearth, or view me, stark and ; s I i'.....i ll  -             ... e   AI O t1DI D rY L xY11\ VjL-fd3rj -a u r Y Zoo.  cold, a lifeless corpse?"He took his pistol -up, and -slowly aimed it at a cllimney-pot opposite.

"The poor painter's life is over! Caroline, Caroline, I die for thee!" "Runt, Runt, I told you so!' shrieked the fat lady. 4 Heis dying for me, and Caroline's my second name." What the fat lady would have done more, I can't say; for Fitch, disturbed out of his revery by her talking below, looked out, frowning vacantly, and saying, "Ulloh! we've hinterlopers 'ere!" suddenly banged down the window, and pulled down the blinds. This gave a check to the fat lady's projected rush, and disconcert- ed her a little. But she was consoled by Miss Runt, promised to return on the morrow, and went home happy in the idea that her Andrea was faithful to her. Alas, poor fat lady! little did you know the truth. It was Caro- line Gann Fitch was raving about; and it was a part of his last let- ter to her, to be delivered after his death, that hle was spouting out of the window. Was the crazy painter going to fight a duel, or was he going to kill himself? This will be explained in the next chapter. CHAPTER VIII.

Unlike the love of most men, Andreal's passion was not chlaracter- ized by jealousy and watchfulness, othelirvise lie would not have failed to perceive certain tokens of inltelligence passing from time to time between Caroline and Brandon, and the ladly's evident coldness to himself.

"These verses, madam, -a faded violet, word for word, gracious Eavens! every word!" roared Fitch, advancing with the book. She looked at him rather vacantly, and as the'violets caught her eye7 put out her hand, and took them. "Do you know the hawthor, Miss Gann, of The faded Violets'?" "Author? O yes; they are - they are George's!" She burst into tears as she said that word; and, pulling the little faded flow- ers to pieces, went sobbing out of the'room.   A SHABBY GENTE-EL STORY. Y2 Dear, dear little Caroline! she has- only been in love two months, and is already beginning to feel the woes of it! It cannot be from want of experience, - for I have felt the noble passion of love many timues these forty years, since I was a boy of twelve (by which the reader may form a pretty good guess of my age),-it cannot be, I say, from want of experience that I am unable to describe, step by step, the progress of a love-affair; nay, I am perfectly certain that I could, if I chose, make a most aston- ishing and heart-lrending iber amoris; but, nevertheless, I always feel a vast repugnance to the following out of a subject of this kind, which I attribute to a natural diffidence and sense of shame that prevent me from enlarging on a theme that has in it something sacred, - certain arcana which an honest man, although initiated into them, should not divulge. If such coy scruples and blushing delicacy prevent one from pass- ing the threshold even of an honorable love, and setting down, at so many guineas or shillings per page, the pious emotions and tender- nesses of two persons chastely and legally engaged in sighing, ogling, hand-squeezing, kissing, and so forth (for with such out- ward signs I believe that the passion of love is expressed),-if a man feel, I say, squeamish about describing an innocent love, he is doubly disinclined to describe a guilty one; and I have always felt a kind of loathing for the skill of such geniuses as Rousseau or Richardson, who could paint with sucl painful accuracy all the struggles and woes of Eloise and Clarissa, - all "he wicked arts and triumphs of such scoundrels as Lovelace. We have in this history a scoundrelly Lovelace in the person going by the name of George Brandon, and a dear, tender, innocent, yielding creature on whom he is practising his infernal skill; and whether the public feel any sympathy for her or not, the writer can only say, for his part, that he heartily loves and respects. poor little Caroline, and is quite unwilling to enter into any of the slow, pain- ful, wicked details of the courtship which passed between her and her lover.   .

There was no wild, con- ceited tale that Brandon told Caroline which she did not believe; no vire which she could conceive or had read of in novels, with which she did not endow him. Many long talks had they, and many sweet, stolen interviews, during the periods in which Caro- line's father and mother were away making merry at the house of their son-in-law; and while she was left under the care of her vir- tue and of Becky the maid. Indeed, it was a blessing that the lat- ter was left in the joint guardianship. For Becky, who had such an absurd opinion of her young lady's merits as to fancy that she was a fit wife for any gentleman of the land, and that any gentle- man might be charmed and fall in love with her, had some instinct, or possibly some experience, as to the passions and errors of youth, and warned Caroline accordingly. "If he's really in love, Miss, and I think he be, he'll marry you; if he won't marry you, he's a rascal, and you're too good for him, and must have nothing to do with him." To which Caroline replied, that she was sure Mr. 'Brandon was the most angelic, high-principled of human beings, and that she was sure his intentions were of the most honorable description. We have before described what Mr. Brandon's character was. He was not a man of honorable intentions at all. But he was a gentleman of so excessively eager a temperament, that if properly resisted by a practised coquette, or by a woman of strong principles, he would sacrifice anything to obtain his ends, - nay, marry to obtain -them; and, considering his disposition, it is only a wonder that he had not been married a great number of times already; for he had been in love perpetually since his seventeenth year. By which the reader may pretty well appreciate the virtue or the pru- dence of the ladies with whom hitherto our inflammable young gen- tleman had had to do. The fruit, then, of all his stolen interviews, of all his prayers,   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          2389 vows, and protestations to Caroline, had been only this,- that she loved him; but loved him as an honest girl should, and was ready to go to the altar with him when he chose. He talked about his family, his peculiar circumstances, his proud father's curse. Little Caroline only sighed, and said her dearest Georgfe must wait until' he could obtain his parent's consent. When pressed harder, she would burst into tears, and wonder how one so good and affectionate as he could propose to her anything unworthy of them both. It is clear to see that the young lady had read a vast number of novels, and knew something of the nature of love; and that she had a good principle and honesty of her own, which set her lover's schemes at naught: indeed, she had both these advantages, - her education, such as it was, having given her the one, and her honest nature having endowed her with the other. On the day when Fitch came down to Caroline with his verses Brandon had pressed these unworthy propositions upon her. She had torn herself violently away from him, and rushed to the door; but the poor little thing fell before she could reach it, screaming in a fit of hysterics, which brought Becky to her aid, and caused Bran- don to leave her, abashed. He went out; she watched him go, and stole up into his room, and laid on his table the first letter she had ever written to him. It was written in pencil, in a trembling, school-girl hand, and contained simply the following words:- "George, you have almost broken my heart. Leave me if you will, and if you dare not act like an honest man. If ever you speak to me so again as you did this morning, I declare solemnly before Heaven, I will take poison. "C." Indeed, the poor thing had read romances to some purpose; without them, it is probable she never would have thought of such a means of escape from a lover's persecutions; and there was some- thing in the girl's character that made Brandon feel sure that she would keep her promise. How the words agitated him! He-felt a violent mixture of raging disappointment and admiration, and loved the girl ten thousand times more than ever.  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6538-00000123"/> 240o         GOOD STORIES. Mr. Brandon had scaircely finished the reading of this document, and was yet agitated by the various passions which the perusal of it created, when the door of his apartment was violently flung open, and some one came in. Brandon started, and turned round, with a kind of dread that Caroline had already executed her threat, and that a messenger was come to inform him of her death. Mr. An- drea Fitch was the intruder. His hat was on,-his eyes were glaring; and if the beards of men did stand on end anywhere but in poems and romances, his, no doubt, would have formed round his countenance a bristling auburn halo. As it was, Fitch only looked astonishingly fierce, as hle stalked up to the table, his hands behind his back. When he had arrived at this barrier between himself and DMr. Brandon he stopped, and, speechless, stared that gentleman in the face. "May I beg, Mr. Fitch, to know what has procured me the hon- or of this visit?" exclaimed Mr. Brandon, after a brief pause of wonder. "Honor!-ha, ha, ha!" growled Mr. Fitch, in a most sardonic, discordant way,- " honor!" "Well, sir, honor or no honor, I call tell you, my good man, it certainly is no pleasure!" said Brandon, testily. "In plain English, then, what the devil has brought you here?" Fitch plumped the album down on the table close to Mr. Bran- don's nose, and said, "That has brought me, sir, - that halburm, sir ; or, I ask your pardon, that a, - album, - ha, ha, ha " "O I see!" said Mr. Brandon, who could not refrain from a smile.

And Mr. Brandon would have come on, but for a circumstance that deterred him; and this was, tlhat Mr. Fitch drew from his bosom a long, sharp, shining, waving poniard of the Middle Ages, that formed a part of his artistical properties, and with which he had armed himself for this encounter. Comle on, sir!" shrieked Fitch, brandishing this fearful weapon. "Lay a finger on me, and I bury this blade in your treacherous 'art. Ha! do you tremble?" Indeed the aristocratic Mr. Brandon turned somewhat pale. Well, well," said he, " what do you want? Do you suppose I am to be bullied by your absurd melodramatic airs! It was, after all, but a joke, sir, and I am sorry that it has offended you. Can I say more?- what shall I do?" "You shall hapologize; not only to me, sir, but you shall tell Miss Caroline, in my presence, that you stole those verses from me, and used them quite unauthorizediby me." "Look you, Mr. Fitch, I will make you another set of verses quite as good, if you like; but what you ask is impossible." 4 I will 'asten myself, then, to Miss Caroline, and acquaint her with your dastardly forgery, sir.

"Sir," said Mr. Brandon, with the utmost stateliness and scorn, "if you wish to murder me as you do the king's. English, I won't balk you.

But have a care; by Heavens, I won't spare you, and I call hit an ace of hearts at twenty paces!" "Two can play at that," said Mr. Fitch, calmly; " and if I can't hit a hace of 'arts at twenty paces, I can hit a man at twelve, and to-morrow I'll try " ; with which, giving Mr. Brandon a look of the highest contempt, the young painter left the room. What were Mr. Brandon's thoughts, as his antagonist left him? Strange to say, rather agreeable. He had much too great a con- tempt for Fitch to suppose that so low a fellow should ever think seriously of fighting him, and reasoned with himself thus:- "This Fitch, I know, will go off to Caroline, tell her the whole transaction, frighten her with the tale of a duel, and then she and I shall have a scene. I will tell her the truth about those infernal verses, menace death, blood, and danger, and then- " Here he fell back into a charming revery; the wily fellow knew what power such a circumstance would give him over a poor, weak girl, who would do anything rather than that her beloved should risk his life. And with this dastardly speculation as to the price he should ask for refraining from meeting Fitch, he was entertain- ing himself; when, much to his annoyance, that gentleman came into the room. "Mr. Brandon," said he, "you have insulted me in the grossest and cruellest way." "Well, sir, are you come to apologize?" said Brandon, sneer- ingly. "'No, I'm not come to apologize, Mr. Aristocrat: it's past that. I 'm come to say this, sir, that I take you for a coward; and that, unless you will give me your solemn word of honor not to mention a word of this quarrel to Miss Gann, which might prevent our meeting, I will never leave you till we do fight!"

"And how, pray, sir?" "Why, in the first place, here's a stick, and I 11 'orsewhip you; and here are a pair of pistols, and we can fight now!" "Well, sir, I give you my honor," said Mr. Brandon, in a dia- bolical rage; and added, "I 'll meet you to-morrow, not now; and you need not be afraid that I 'll miss you!" "Hadew, sir," said -the chivalrous little Fitch; " bon giorno, sir, as we used to say at Rome." And so, for the second time, he left Mr. Brandon, who did not like very well the extraordinary courage he had displayed. "What the deuce has exasperated the fellow so?" thought Brandon. Why, in the first place, he had crossed Fitch in love; and, in the second, he had sneered at his pronunciation and his gentility, and Fitch's little soul was in a fury which nothing but blood would allay: he was determined, for the sake of his hart and his lady, to bring this proud champion down. So Brandon was at last left to his cogitations; when, confusion! about five o'clock came another knock at his door. ! Come in!" growled the owner of the lodgings. A sallow, blear-eyed, rickety, undersized creature, tottering upon a pair of high-heeled lacquered boots, and supporting himself upon an immense gold-knobbed cane, entered the room with his hat on one side and a jaunty air. It was a white hat with a broad brim, and under it fell a great deal of greasy lank hair, that shrouded the cheekbones of the wearer. The little man had no beard to his chin, appeared about twenty years of age, and might weigh, stick and all, some seven stone. If you wish to know how this exquisite was dressed, I have the pleasure to inform you that he wore a great sky-blue embroidered satin stock, in the which figured a carbuncle that looked like a lambent gooseberry. He had a shawl-waistcoa of many colors; a pair of loose, blue trousers, neatly strapped to show his little feet; a brown cut-away coat with brass buttons, that fitted tight round a spider waist; and over all a white or drab surtouty  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6538-00000125"/> 244         GOOD STORIES. with a sable collar and cuffs, from which latter on each hand peeped five little fingers covered with lemon-colored kid gloves. One of these hands he held constantly to his little chest; and, with a hoarse, thin voice, he piped out, - "George, my buck! how goes it?" We have been thus particular in our description of the costume of this individual (whose inward man strongly corresponded with his manly and agreeable exterior), because he was the person whom Mr. Brandon most respected in the world. "CNQBARS!" exclaimed our hero: "why, what the deuce has brought you to Margate?" s"Fwendship, my old cock!" said the Honorable Augustus Fred- erick Ringwood, commonly called Viscount Cinqbars, for indeed it was he!-" fwendship and the City of Canterbuwy steamer!" and herewith his lordship held out his right-hand forefinger to Brandon, who enclosed it most cordially in all his. "Wath n't it good of me, now, George, to come down and conthole you in thith curthed thupid place - hay now?" said my lord, after these salutations. Brandon swore he was very glad to see him, which was very true, for he had no sooner set his eyes upon his lordship, than he had determined to borrowas much money from him as ever he could induce the young nobleman to part with. "I 'll tell you how it wath, my boy; you thee I wath thopping at Longth, when I found, by Jove, that the governor -wath come to town!

The two gentlemen conversed for some time longer. Mr. Bran- don was a shrewd fellow, and knew perfectly well a fact of which, no doubt, the reader has a notion, --namely, that Lord Cinqbars was a ninny; but, nevertheless, Brandon esteemed him highly as a lord.- We pardon stupidity in lords; nature or instinct, however sarcastic a man may be among ordinary persons, renders him towards men of quality benevolently blind: a divinity hedges not only the king, but the whole peerage. "That's the girl, I suppose," said my lord, knowingly winking at Brandon: "that little pale girl, who let me in, I mean. A nice little filly, upon my honor, Georgy, my buck!" "O- that - yes - I wrote, I think, something about her," said Brandon, blushing slightly; for, indeed, he now began to wish that his fiiend should make no comments upon a young lady with whom he was so much in love. "I suppose it's all up now?" continued my lord, looking still more knowing. "All over with her, hay? I saw it was by her looks, in a minute." "Indeed,.you do me a great deal too much honor. Miss - ah - Miss Gann is a very respectable young person, and I would not for the world have you to suppose that I would do anything that should the least injure her character." At this speech Lord Cinqbars was at first much puzzled; but, in considering it, was fully convinced that Brandon was a deeper dog than ever. Boiling with impatience to know the particulars of this delicate intrigue, this canning diplomatist determined he would pump the whole story out of Brandon by degrees; and so, in the course of half an hour's conversation that the young men had together, Cinqbars did not make less than forty allusions to the sub- ject that interested him. At last Brandon cut him short rather haughtily, by begging that he would make no further allusions to the subject, as it was one that was excessively disagreeable to him.  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6538-00000126"/> 2446        GOOD STORIES. In fact, there was no mistake about it now. George Brandon was in love with Caroline. He felt that he was while he blushed at his friend's alluding to her, while he grew indignant at the young lord's coarse banter about her. Turning the conversation to another point, he asked Cinqbars about his voyage, and whether he lad brought any companion with him to Margate; whereupon my lord related all his feats in London, how he had been to the watch-house, how many bottles of cham- pagne he had drunk, how he had " milled" a policeman, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and he concluded by saying that he had come down with Tom Tufthunt, who was at the inn at that very moment smoking a cigar. This did not increase Brandon's good-humor; and when Cinq- bars mentioned his friend's name, Brandon saluted it-mentally with a hearty curse. These two gentlemen hated each other of old. Tufthunt was a small college man of no family, with a foundation fellowship; and it used to be considered that a sporting fellow of a small college was a sad, raffish, disreputable character. Tufthunt, then, was a vulgar fellow, and Brandon a gentleman, so they hated each other. They were both toadies of the same nobleman, so they hated each other. They had had some quarrel at college about a disputed bet, which Brandon knew he owed, and so they hated each other; and in their words about it, Brandon had threatened to horsewhip Tufthunt, and called himrn a " sneaking, swindling, small college-snob"; and so little Tufthunt, who had not resented the words, hated Brandon far more than Brandon hated him. The lat- ter only had a contempt for his rival, and voted him a profound bore and vulgarian, So, although Mr. Tufthunt did not choose- to frequent Mr. Bran- don's rooms, he was very anxious that his friend, the young lord, should not fall into his old bear-leader's hands again, and came down to Margate to counteract any influence which the arts of Brandon might acquire. "Curse the fellow " thought Tufthunt in his heart (thee- was a fine reciprocity of curses between the two men)i; ",he has drawn   anE L X" - , "RY A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          2  - Cinqbars already for fifty pounds this year, and will have some half of his last remittance, if I don't keep a lookout, the swindling thief! i And so frightened was Tufthunt at the notion of Brandon's return to power and dishonest use of it, that he was at the time on the point of writing to Lord Ringwood to tell him of his son's doings, only he wanted some money deucedly himself. Of Mr. Tufthunt's physique and history it is necessary merely to say, that he was the son of a country attorney who was agent to a lord; he had been sent to a foundation-sbchool, where he had distinguished himself for ten years, by fighting and being flogged more than any boy of the five hundred. From the foundation-school he went to college with an exhibition, which was succeeded by a fellowship, which was to  end in a living. In his person Mr. Tufthunt was short and bow- legged; he wore a sort of clerico-sporting costume, consisting of a black straight-cut coat, and light drab breeches, with a vast num- ber of buttons at the ankles; a sort of dress much affected by sporlting gentlemen of the university in the author's time. Well, Brandon said he had some letters to write, and promised to follow his friend, which hle did; but, if the truth must be ,toldj so infatuated was the young man become with his passion, with the resistance he had met with, and so nervous from the various occur- rences of the morning, that he passed the half-hour during which he was free from Cinqbars' society in kneeling, imploring, weeping at Caroline's little garret-door, which had remained piteously closed to him. He was wild with disappointment, mortification, - mad, longing to see her. The cleverest coquette in Europe could not have so inflamed him. His first act on entering the dinner-room was to drink off a large tumbler of champagne; and when Cinq- bars, in his elegant way, began to rally him upon his wildness, Mr. Brandon only growled and cursed with frightful vehemency, and applied again to the bottle. His face, which had been quite white, grew a bright red; his tongue, which had been tied, began to chat- ter vehemently; before the fish was off the table, Mr. Brandon showed strong symptoms of intoxication before the dessert appearld, m,  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6538-00000127"/> ^':Cljl y-'i L:% IfY?^^^InK r rl'- N *"*-*---- ..;----l'  ,P ."  248-         GOOD- STORIES. Mr. Tufthunt, winking knowingly to Lord Cinqbars, had begun to draw him out; and Brandon, with a number of shrieks and oaths, was narrating the history of his attachment. "t Look you, Tufthunt," said he, wildly; " hang you, I hate you, but I must talk! I've been,for two months now, in this cursed hole; in a rickety lodging, with a vulgar family; as vulgar, by Jove, as you are yourself!" Mr. Tufthunl; did not like this style of address half so much as Lord Cinqbars, who was laughing immoderately and to whom Tufthunt whispered rather sheepishly, c Pooh, pooh, he's drunk!" "Drunk! no, sir," yelled out Brandon; "I'm mad, though, with the prudery of a little devil of fifteen, who has cost me more trouble than it would take me to seduce every one of your sisters, - ha, ha! every one of the Miss Tufthunts, by Jove! Miss Suky Tufthunt, Miss Dolly Tufrhunt, Miss Anna-Maria Tufthunt, and the whole bunch. Come, sir, don't sit scowling at me, or I'll brain y3ou with the decanter." - (Tufthunt was down again on the sofa.) "I've borne with the girl's mother, and her father, and her sisters, and a cook in the louse, and a scoundrel of a painter, that I'm going to fight- about her; and for what?-w why, for a letter, which says, 'George, I'll kill myself! George, I'll kill myself!'-ha, ]la! a little devil like that killing herself!- ha, ha! and H I who who adore her, who am mad for " "Mad, I believe he is," said Tufthunt; and at this moment Mr. Brandon- was giving the most unequivocal signs of madness; he plunged his head into the corner of the sofa, and was kicking his feet violently into the cushions. "You don't understand him, Tufty, my boy," said Lord Cinqbars, with a very superior air. s You ain't up to these things, I tell you; and I suspect, by Jove, that you never were in love in your life. I know what it is, sir. And as for Brandon, Heaven bless you! I.'ve often seen him in that way when we were abroad. When he has an intrigue, he's mad about its Let me see, there was the Countess Fritzsch, at Baden-Baden; there was the woman at Pau; and that girl-at Paris, was it?-no, at Vienna.  He went on just so    A -SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.         249 about them all; but I'll tell you what, when we do the thing we do it easier, my boy, hay?" And so saying, my lord cocked up his little, sallow, beardless face into a grin, and then fell to eying a glass of execrable claret across a candle. An intrigue, as he called it, was the little creature's de- light; and until the time should arrive when he could have one himself, he loved to talk of those of his friends. As for Tufthunt, we may fancy how that gentleman's previous affection for Brandon was increased by the latter's brutal addresses to him. Brandon continued to drink and to talk, though not always in the sentimental way in which he had spoken about his loves and injuries. Growing presently madly jocose as he had before been madly melancholy, he narrated to the two gentlemen the particulars of llis quarrel with Fitch, mimicking the little painter's manner in an excessively comic way, and, giving the most ludicrous account of his person, kept his companions in a roar of laughter. Cinqbars swore that he would see the fun in the morning, and agreed that if the painter wanted a second, either he or Tufthunt would act for him. Now my Lord Cinqbars had an excessively clever servant, a merry rogue, whom he had discovered in the humble capacity of scout's assistant at Christ Church, and raised to be his valet. The chief duties of the valet were to black his lord's beautiful boots, that we have admired so much, and put his lordship to bed when over- taken with liquor. He heard every word of the young men's talk (it being his habit, much encouraged by his master, to join occasion- ally in the conversation); and in the course of the night, when at supper with Monsieur Donnerwetter and Mdlle. Augustine, he re- lated every word of the talk above stairs, mimicking Brandon quite as cleverly as the latter had mimicked Fitch. When then, after making his company laugh by describing Brandon's love-agonies, Mr. Tom informed them how that gentleman had a rival, with whom he was going to fight a duel the next morning, - an artist-fellow with an immense beard, whose name was Fitch, to his surprise Mdlle. Augustine burst into a scream of laughter, and exclaimed, e Feesh  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6538-00000128"/> 250-         GOOD STORIE&amp; Feesh! c'est noire homme;- it is our manyare!

It was too true, the fat lady was thamous MRS. CARRICKFER- GUS, and she had come all thel  from Rome in pursuit of her adored painter.  CHAPTER      IX. WHCH THREATENS DEATH, BUT CONTAINS A GREAT DEAL OF MARRYING. As the morrow was to be an eventful day in the lives of all the heroes and heroines of this history, it will be as well to state how they passed the night previous. Brandon, like the English before the battle of Hastings, spent the evening in feasting and carousing; and Lord Cinqbars, at twelve o'clock, his usual time after his usual quantity of drink, was carried up to bed by the servant kept by his lordship for that purpose. Mr. Tufthunt took this as a hint to wish Brandon good night, at the same time promising that he and Cinq-1 bars would not fail him in the morning about the duel. Shall we confess that Mr. Brandon, whose excitement now began to wear off, and who had a dreadful headache, did not at all relish the idea of the morrow's combat? s If," said he, "I shoot this crack-brained painter, all the world will cry out ' Murder!'. If he'shoot me, all the world will laugh at me! And yet, confound him! he seems so bent upon blood, that there is no escaping a meeting." At any rate, Brandon thought, there will be no harm in a letter to Caroline. So, on arriving at home,he sat down and wrote a very pathetic one; saying, that he fought in her cause, and if he died,   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.         251 his last breath should be for her. So having written, he jumped into bed, and did not sleep one single wink all night. As Brandon passed his night like the English, Fitch went through his like the Normans, in fasting, and mortification, and meditation. The poor fellow likewise indited a letter to Caroline; a very long and strong one, interspersed with pieces of poetry, and containing the words we have just heard him utter out of the. win- dow. Then he thought about making his will: but he recollected, and, indeed, it was a bitter thought to the young man, that there was not one single soul in the wide world who cared for him, except, indeed, thought he, after a pause, that poor Mrs. Carrickfer- gus at Rome, who did like me, and was the only person who ever bought my drawings. So he made over all his sketches to her, regulated his little property, found that he had money enough to. pay his walsherwoman; and so, having disposed of his worldly con- cerns, MDr. Fitch also jumped into bed, and speedily fell into a deep sleep. Brandon could hear him snoring all night, and did not feel a bit the mnore comfortable because his antagonist took matters so unconcernedly. Indeed, our poor painter had no guilty thoughts in his breast, nor no particular revenge against Brandon, now that the first pangs of mortified vanity were over. But, with all his vagaries, he was a man of spirit; and after what had passed in the morning, the trea- son that had been done him, and the insults heaped upon him, he felt that the duel was irrevocable. He had a misty notion, imbibed somewhere, that it was the part of a gentleman's duty to fight duels, and had long been seeking for an oppolrtunity. "Suppose I do die," said he, 4C what's the odds? Caroline does n't care for me. Dr. Wackerbart's boys won't have their drawing-lesson next Wednesday; and no more will be said of poor Andrea." And now for the garret. Caroline was wrapped up in her own woes, poor little soul! and in the alrms of the faithful Becky cried herself to sleep. But the slow hours passed on; and the tide, which had been out, now came in; and her lamps waxed fainter- and fainter; and the watchman cried six o'clock; and the sun  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6538-00000129"/> 252"         GOOD STORIES. arose and gilded the minarets of Margate; and Becky got up and scoured the steps, and the kitchen, and made ready the lodgers' breakfasts; and at half past eight there came a thundering rap at the door, and two gentlemen, one with a mahogany case under his arm, asked for Mr. Brandon, and were shown up to his room by the astonished Becky, who was bidden by Mr. Brandon to get breakfast- for three. The thundering rap awakened Mr. Fitch, who rose and dressed himself in his best clothes, gave a twist of the curling-tongs to his beard, and conducted himself throughout with perfect coolness. Nine o'clock struck, and he wrapped his cloak round him, and put under his cloak that pair of foils which we have said he possessed, and did not know in the least how to use. However, he had heard his camarades d'atelier, at Paris and Rome, say that they were the best weapons for duelling; and so forth he issued. Becky was in the passage as he passed down; she was always scrubbing there. Becky," said Fitch, in a hollow voice, t' here is a letter; if I should not return in half an hour, give it to Miss Gann, and promise on your honor that she shall not have it sooner." Becky promised. She thought the painter was at some of his mad tricks. He went out of the door saluting her gravely. But he went only a few steps and came back again. "Becky," said he, "you,- you're always been a good gilrl to me, and here's something for you ; per'aps we sha'n't - we sha'n't see each other for some time." The tears were in his eyes as he spolre, and he handed her over seven shillings and fourpence hlalfpenny, being every farthing he possessed in the world. "Well, I'm sure!" said Becky; and that was all she said, for she pocketed the money, and fell to scrubbing again. Presently the three gentlemen up stairs came clattering down. ' Lock bless you, don't be in such a 'urry!" exclaimed Becky;- "it's full herly yet, and the water's not biling." "We 'll come back to breakfast, my dear," said one, a little gen- tleman in high-lheeled boots; "and, I thay, mind and have thum   A SHABBY GE4NTEEl, 'STORY.        253 thloda-water9; and he walked out, twirling his cane. *His friend with the case followed him. Mr. Brandon rcame last. He too turned back after he had gone a few paces. "Becky," said he, in a grave voice, "'if I am not back in half an hour, give that to Miss Gann." Becky was fairly flustered by this; and after turning the letters round and round, and peeping into the sides, and looking at the seals very hard, she like a fool determined that she would not wait half an hour, but carry them up to Miss Caroline; and so up she mounted, finding pretty Caroline in the act of lacing her stays. And the consequences of Becky's conduct was that little Carry left off lacing her stays (a sweet little figure the poor thing looked in them ; but that is neither here nor there), took the letters, looed at one which she threw down directly; at the other, which she ea- gerly opened, and having read a line or two, gave a loud scream, and fell down dead in a fainting fit! Waft us, O Muse, to Mr. Wright's hotel, and quick narrate what chances there befell. Very early in the morning Mdlle.

'Figurez vous mnademnoiselle, que notre homme va se battre, - O, but it will be droll to see him sword in hand!" "Don't plague me with your ojous servants' quarrels, Augustine, that horrid courier is always quarrelling and tipsy." "Mon Dieu, qu'elle est bete!" exclaimed Augustine: but I*tell you it is not the courier; it is -he, I'oljet, le peintre dont madame s'est amourachee, Monsieur Peesh." "Mr. Fitch!" cried Runt, jumping up in bed, - s Mr. Fitch going to fight! Augustine, my stockings, -quick, my robe-de-chambre, -tell me when, how, where?" And so Augustine told her that the combat was to take place at nine that morning, behind the Windmill, and that the gentleman  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6538-00000130"/> -24         GOOD STORIES, -, with whom Mr. Fitch was to go out had been dining at the hotel the night previous, in company with the little milor, who was to be his second. Quick as lightning flew Bunt to the chamber of her patroness. That lady was in a profound sleep; and I leave you to imagine what were her sensations on awaking and hearing this dreadful tale. Such is the force of love, that although, for many years, Mrs. Carrickfergus had never left her bed before noon, although in all her wild wanderings after the painter she, nevertheless, would have her tea and cutlet in bed, and her doze likewise, before she set forth on a journey, she now started up in an instant, forgetting her nap, mutton-chops, everything, and began dressing with a promptitude which can only be equalled by Harlequin when dis- guising himself in a pantomime. She would have had an attack of nerves, only she knew there was no time for it; and I do believe that twenty minutes were scarcely over her head, as the saying is, when her bonnet and cloak were on, and with her whole suite, and an inn-waiter or two whom she pressed into her service, she was on full trot to the field of action. For twenty years before, and from that day to this, Marianne Carrickfergus never had or has walked so quickly. "Hullo, here 'th a go!" exclaimed Lord Viscount Cinqbars, as they arrived on the ground behind the Windmill; "cuth me, there 5th only one man!" This was indeed the case: Mr. Fitch, in his great cloak, was pacing slowly up and down the grass, his shadow stretching far in the sunshine. Mr. Fitch was alone too; for the fact is, he had never thought about a second. This he admitted frankly, bowing with much majesty to the company as they came up. ; But that, gents, said he, "will make no difference, I hope, nor prevent fair play from being done." And, flinging off his cloak, he produced the foils, from which the buttons had been taken off. He went up to Brandon, and was for offering him one of the weapons, just as they   A SHiABBY GENTEEL STORY.         255 do at the theatre. Brandon stepped back, rather abashed; Cinq- bars looked posed; Tufthunt delighted: ' Ecod," said he, I hope the bearded fellow will give it him.' - Excuse me, sir," said Mr. Brandon, as the challenged party, I demand pistols." Mr. Fitch, with great presence of mind and gracefulness, stuck the swords into the grass. "O, pithtolth of courth," lisped my lord; and presently called aside Tufthunt, to whom he whispered something in great glee; to which Tufthunt objected at first, saying, "No, d- him, let him fight." "And your fellowship and living, Tufty, my boy?" inter- posed my lord; and then they walked on. After a couple of min- utes, during which Mr. Fitch was employed in examining Mr. Brandon from the toe upwards to the crown of his head, or hat, just as Mr. Widdicombe does Mr. Cartlich, before those two gen- tlemen proceed to join in combat on the boards of Astley's Amphi- theatre (indeed, poor Fitch had no other standard of chivalry), - when Fitch had concluded this examination, of which Brandon did not know what the deuce to make, Lord Cinqbars came back to the painter, and gave him a nod. "Sir," said he, " as you have come unprovided with a second, 1, with your leave, will act as orfe. My name is Cinqbars,-Lord Cinqbars; and though I had come to the ground to act as the friend of my friend here, Mr. Tufthunt will take that duty upon him , and as it appears to me that there can be no other end to this unhappy affair, we will proceed at once." It is a marvel how Lord Cinqbars ever made such a gentlemanly speech. When Fitch heard that he was to have a lord for a sec- ond, he laid his hand on his chest, and vowed it was the greatest h-honor of his life; and was turning round to walk towards his ground, when my lord, gracefully thrusting his tongue into his cheek, and bringing his thumb up to his nose, twiddled about his fingers for a moment, and said to Brandon, "Gammon." Mr. Brandon smiled and heaved a great, deep, refreshing sigh. The truth was, a load was taken off his mind, of which he was very  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6538-00000131"/>    266         GOOD STORIES. glad to be rid; for there was something in the coolness of thF crazy painter that our fashionable gentleman did not at all approv of. "I think, Mr. Tufthunt," said Lord Cinqbars, very loud, "tha considering the gravity of the case, - threatening horsewhipping you know, lie on both sides, and lady in the case, - I think we mus have the banrrier-duel." "What's that?" said Fitch. "The simplest thing in the world; and," in a whisper,a let m add, the best for you: Look here. We shall put you at twent paces, and a hat between you. You walk forward and fire when yo like. When you fre, you stop; and you both have the liberty c wallking up to the hat. Nothing can be more fair than that." sc Very well," said Fitch; and, with a great deal of preparatior the pistols were loaded. I 'll tell you what," whispered Cinqbars to Fitch, "if I had ni chosen this way, you were a dead man. If he fires, he hits yot dead. You must not let him fire, but have him down first." ' I 'll try," said Fitch, who was a little pale, and thanked hi noble friend for his counsel. The hat was placed, and the men too] their places. "Are you all ready?" "Ready," said Brandon. "Advance when I drop my handkerchief." And presently dowr it fell, Lord Cinqbars crying, "Now!" The combatants both advanced, each covering his man. Whel he had gone about six paces, Fitch stopped, fired, and - missed He grasped his pistol tightly, for he was very near dropping it and then stood biting his lips, and looking at Brandon, who grinne savagely, and walked up to the hat. - Will you retract what you said of me yesterday, you villain?' said Brandon. ( I can't." "Will you beg for life?" No."   ** * I     ------- ---            ,^i^B A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          257 " Then take a minute, and make your peace with God, for you are a dead manl." Fitch dropped his pistol to the ground, shut his eyes for a mo- ment, and flinging up his chest, and clenching his fists, said, "Now I 'm ready." Brandon fred, - and strange to say, Andrea Fitch, as he gasped  and staggered backwards, saw, or thought he saw, Mr. Brandon's  pistol flying up in the air, where it went off, and heard that gentle- man yell out an immense oath in a very audible voice. Whepn he came to himself, a thick stick was lying at Brandon's feet; Mr. Brandon was capering about the ground, and cursing and shaking a maimed elbow, and a whole posse of people were rushing upon them. The first was the great German courier, who rushed upon Brandon, and shook that gentleman, and. shouting, so Schelm! spitz- bube! blagard! goward!" in his ear. 'If I had not drown my i stick and brogen his damt arm, he wod have murdered dat boor young man." The German's speech contained two unfounded assertions; in the first place, Brandon would not have murdered Fitch; and, secondly, his arm was not broken,-he had merely received a blow on that part which anatomists called the funny-bone; a severe blow, which sent the pistol spinning into the air, and caused the gentleman to scream with pain. Two waiters seized upon the murderer too: a baker, who had been brought from his rounds; a bellman; several boys, -were yelling around him, and shouting out, "Pole-e-eace " Next to these came, panting and blowing, some women. Could Fitch believe his eyes? - that fat wotman in red satin! - yes - no -yes-he was, he was in the arms of Mrs. Carrickfergus!  The particulars of this meeting are too delicate to relate. Suffice it to say that somehow matters were explained, Mr. Brandon was let loose, and a fly was presently seen to drive up, into which Mr. Fitch consented to enter with his new-found friend. Brandon had some good movements in him. As Fitch was getting into the carriage, he walked up to him and held out his left rTe A     1   &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6538-00000132"/>  258         GOOD STORIES. hand: I can't offer you my right hand, Mr. Fitch, for that cursec courier's stick has maimed it; but I hope you will allow me to apologize for my shameful conduct to you, and to say that I nevei in my life met a more gallant fellow than yourself." , That he is, by Jove!" said my Lord Cinqbars. Fitch blushed as red as a peony and trembled verytch. "An yet,' said he, "you would have murdered me just now, Mr. Bran don. I can't take yoir 'and, sir." 'Why, you great flat,. said my lord, wisely, "he couldn't have 'hurt you, nor you him. There wath no ballth in the pithtolth." "What," said Fitch, starting back, " do you gents call that a joke  O my lord, my lord!  And here poor Fitch actually burst intc tears on the red satin bosom of Mrs. Carrickfergus: she and MisE Runt were crying as hard as they could. And so, amidst mud shouting and huzzaing, the fly drove away. What a blubbering, abthurd donkey!" said Cinqbars, with hi usual judgment; 4' ain't he, Tufthunt?" ,Tufthunt, of course, said yes; but Brandon was in a virtuou mood. "By Heavens!

It was no other than this, that, forgetting all maidenly decenc) and decorum, before Lord Viscount Cinqbars and his friend, tha silly little creature, Caroline Gann, rushed out from the parlor intc the passage,- she had been at the window ever since she was rid of her fainting fit! and, ah! what agonies of fear had that little panting heart endured during the half-hour of her lover's absence - Caroline Gann, I say, rushed into- the passage, and leaped upor   A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.          259 the neck of Brandon, and kissed him, and called him her dear, dear, dear, darling George, and sobbed, and laughed, until George, taking her round the waist gently, carried her into the little dingy parlor, and closed the door behind him." "Egad," cried Cinqbars, "' this is quite a thene! Hullo, Becky, Polly, what's your name?-bring uth up the breakfatht; and I hope you've remembered the thoda-water. Come along up thtairth, Tufty, my boy." *     X    X     X     X . When Brandon came,up stairs and joined them, which he did in a minute or two, consigning Caroline to Becky's care, his eyes were full of tears; and when Cinqbars began to rally him in his usual delicate way, Brandon said, gravely:"No laughing, sir, if you please; for I swear that that lady before long shall be my wife." "Your wife! - and what will your father say, and what will your duns say, and what will Miss Goldmore say, with her hundred thousand pounds?" cried Cinqbars. "Miss Goldmore be hanged," said Brandon, '- and the duns too; and my father may reconcile it to himself as he can." And here Brandon fell into a revery. It's no use thinking," he cried, after a pause. "You see what a girl it is, Cinqbars. I love her,- by Heavens, I'm mad with love for her! She shall be mine, let what will come of it. And besides," he added, in a lower tone of voice, " why need, why need my father know anything about -it?" "O flames and furies, what a lover it is!" exclaimed his friend. "But, by Jove, I like. your spirit; and hang all governors say I. Stop, -a bright thought! If you must marry, why, here's Tom Tufthunt, the very man to do your business."  Little Lord Cinqbars was delighted with the excitement of the affair, and thought to him- self, "By Jove, this is an intrigue!" "What, is Tufthunt in orders?" said Brandon. "Yes," replied that reverend gentleman: "don't you see my coat?  I took orders six weeks ago, on my fellowship. Cinqbars' governor has promised me a living."  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6538-00000133"/> 260          GOOD SVORIES.

And so on that very day, in Brandon's room, without a license, and by that worthy clergyman the Rev. Thomas Tufthlunt, with my Lord Cinqbars for the sole witness, poor Caroline Gann, who knew no better, who never heard of licenses, and did not know what banns meant, was married in a manner to the person calling himself George Brandon; George Brandon not being his real name. No writings at all were made, and the ceremony merely read through. Becky, Caroline's sole guardian, when the poor girl kissed her, and, blushing, showed her gold ring, thought all was in order, and the happy couple set off for Dover .that day, with fifty pounds which Cinqbars lent the bridegroom. Becky received a little letterfrom Caroline, which she promised to carry to her mamma at Swighy's: and it was agreed* that she was to give warning, and come and live with her young lady. Next morn- ing Lord Cinqbars and Tufthunt took the boat for London; the lat- ter uneasy-in mind, the former vowing that '( he 'd never spent such an exciting day in his life, and loved an intrigue of all things." Next morning, too, the great travelling chariot of Mrs. Carrick- fergus rolled away with a bearded gentleman inside. Poor Fitch had been back to his lodgings to try one more chance with Caroline, and he arrived in time -to see her get into a post-chaise alone with Brandon. , ,    -26 A SHABBY GENTEEL STORY.           61 Sixs weeks afterwards Galignani's Messenger contained the fol- lowing announcements: "Married, at the British embassy, by Bishop Luscombe, Andrew Fitch, Esq., to Marianne Calroline Matilda, widow of the late Antony Carrickfergus, of Lombard Street and Gloucester Place, Esquire. The happy pair, after a magnificent dejeune, set off for the South in their splendid carriage-and-fonr. Miss Runt officiated as bride's- maid; and we remarked among the company Earl and Countess Crabs, General Sir Rice Curry, K C.B., Colonel Wapshot, Sir Charles Swang, the Hon. Algernon Percy Deuceace and his lady, Count Punter, and bothers of the elite of the fashionables now in Paris. The bridegroom was attended by his friend Michael Angelo Titmarsh, Esquire; and the lady was given away by the Right Hon. the Earl of Crabs. 'On the departure of the bride and bride- groom  the festivities were resumed, and many a sparkling bumper of Meurices champagne was quaffed to the health of the hospi- table and interesting couple." And with one more marriage this chapter shall conclude. About this time the British Auxiliary Legion came home from Spain; and Lieut.-General Swa er, a knight of San Fernando, of the order of Isabella the Catholicf the Tower and Sword, &amp;c., who, as plain Lieutenant Swabber had loved Miss Isabella Macarty, as a General now actually married her. I leave you to suppose how glorious Mrs. Gann was, and how Gann got tipsy at the Bag of Nails; but as her daughters each insisted upon their 30 a year income, and Mrs. Gann had so only 60 left, she was obliged still to--ontinue the lodging-louse at Margate, in which have occurred the most in- teresting passages of this SHABBY GrENTEEL STORY. Beclky never went to her young mistress, who was not heard of after she wrote the letter to her parent, saying that she was married to Mr. Brandon; but, for particular reasons, her dear husband wished to keep his marriage secret; and for the present her beloved parents must be content to know she was happy.

Mrs. Gann talked unceasingly of her daughter the squire's lady, and her daughter the general's wife; but never once mentioned Caroline after the first burst of wonder and wrath at her depart- ure. -God bless thee, poor Caroline! Thou art happy now, for some short space at least; and here, therefore, let us leave thee. THE END. Cambridge: Stereotyped and Printed by Welch, Bigelow, &amp; Co.  &#xD;</p>
