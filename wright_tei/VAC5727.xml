                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <p>In a large, brilliantly illuminated room in the palace at St. Petersburgh, were seated two persons. The first was a man of tall, commanding presence. He was dressed in the uniform of a Russian general, with this exception, that his epaulettes were formed of black cord, instead of gold. The hilt of his sword was also black. On the middle finger of his left hand he wore a signet ring. It needed but a slight pressure of that ring to sign the death warrant of any one, or what was worse, to consign him to the icy regions of Siberia. Need we say that this man was the Emperor Nicholas of Russia.</p> 
                  <p>The other was a man of medium height. He appeared to be about forty-three or four years of age. He, too, was attired in the dress of a Russian general, but his dress was far more gaudy than that of the Emperor's. His manner betokened restlessness, and a mind ill at ease. Whenever he caught the Emperor's eye fixed on him, he quailed and dropped his eyes to the floor. Thus stood these two great men: the one a tyrant, the other a general.</p> 
                  <p>"So," said the Emperor, as he walked rapidly across the room, "you say he has escaped?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, your Majesty. I said that we failed to arrest him."</p> 
                  <p>On hearing this, the Emperor strode towards the speaker, and fixing his eagle eye on him, he said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Do I know the meaning of the word fail?"</p> 
                  <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5727-00000004"/> 
                  <p>"Your Majesty," said the other, entreatingly, "I have never failed before."</p> 
                  <p>The Emperor walked slowly backwards, and touching the signet with his finger, he said-"Beware!"</p> 
                  <p>On hearing that single word, Gortschakoff sank slowly into a chair, and drawing a handkerchief from his pocket, he wiped the heavy drops of perspiration from his brow.</p> 
                  <p>"Remember," said the Emperor, as he again pointed to the signet, "I never forgive the second time. If, by to-morrow morning, Charles Handermoff is not brought before me, Siberia receives another exile," and again murmuring the word "beware," he left the room.</p> 
                  <p>For a moment the general remained as though paralyzed.</p> 
                  <p>"God!" cried he, as he sank from the chair to the floor, "what can I do? Escape! Ha! the thought is a good one," and he sprang from the floor and walked rapidly to the window. "There is no escape," he muttered, in a voice of agony. "Fool that I was to think it. Who can escape-who has ever escaped the Emperor's wrath? The Emperor, did I say? Rather let it be the tyrant."</p> 
                  <p>"Have it what you will," said a voice near him. Gortschakoff turned and beheld the Emperor standing near him.</p> 
                  <p>"I have changed my mind," said the Emperor, in a fearfully distinct voice. "Should you fail, instead of exile, your reward shall be the knout and the axe," and again pointing to the signet, he left the room.</p> 
                  <p>"The knout!" cried Gortschakoff. "No, no, not the knout. How can I save myself from this indignity! Ha! I have it," and drawing forth his dagger, he raised it high above his head. For a moment he held it thus, and then dropped it.</p> 
                  <p>"I am a coward," he muttered, hoarsely. "I dare not die-and yet why should I die? Fortune may not have deserted me. I have ten hours before me, and what may not a man do in that time, especially when that man is striving against fate for his life?"</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the door opened and a man entered.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! Thulong, what is it? cried Gortschakoff, springing forward.</p> 
                  <p>"We have discovered some clue to the whereabouts of Handermoff," replied the man.</p> 
                  <p>"What! is it so?" cried Gortschakoff, joyfully. "Thulong, you have saved me from the knout, and you have made your fortune. Where is he?"</p> 
                  <p>"In the old mill by the river-at least we were so informed. The information may be false after all."</p> 
                  <p>"Order Major Wyckoff to get out his company," said Gortschakoff. "I will accompany him to the mill. Tell him that if<pb n=""/> he succeeds in capturing this young man, I will promote him before the week is passed. And now, let us away," and throwing his cloak over his shoulder, Gortschakoff and his aid left, the palace.</p> 
                  <p>Let us take the reader to the old mill by the river.</p> 
                  <p>In a small, dimly lighted room, were seated two persons. We will describe them as we go along.</p> 
                  <p>"And so my place of concealment has been discovered," said a tall, good looking young man, who was seated by the fire. As he is the hero of our story, we must describe him. His forehead was high and noble; his eyes were of a deep black; and his hair of a chestnut shade. He was attired in the uniform of a Russian captain, although the clothes seemed to set ill upon him, as though he were not used to wearing them. His complexion was very dark, too much so for one to take him for a Russian. On the table standing near him were two large pistols and a sabre.</p> 
                  <p>"It is so," replied the other, an old man, who appeared to be some seventy years of age. As he spoke he eyed the other keenly, as though wishing to observe what effect the words had on him.</p> 
                  <p>"And think you that they will come for me to-night?" asked the young man.</p> 
                  <p>"It is hard to tell, Monvau," replied the other.</p> 
                  <p>"Call me by my real name, Stractkoff," said the young man. "The assumed name of Monvau sets but illy on me. Would that I were safe in my own country."</p> 
                  <p>"Walls may have ears," said the old man, gazing around him. "The minions of the Emperor are everywhere; and for all we know, one or more of them may be near us now. Hark! me-thought I heard some one at the door."</p> 
                  <p>"Merely the wind," said the other. "But I'll make sure that there is no one there," and seizing his sabre he sprang to the door and threw it open. Hardly had he done so when the lamp was extinguished.</p> 
                  <p>"Strike a light, Stractkoff," said the young man, as he groped his way across the room towards the old man.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is the tinder box?" asked the other.</p> 
                  <p>Before the young man could reply, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and a stern voice summoned him to surrender. With one blow of his sabre the young man severed his enemy's hand from the wrist, and sprang towards the door. Ere he could reach it a dozen men sprang upon him, and despite his struggles they bore him to the floor. Hardly was this done when several men bearing torches in their hand entered the room.</p> 
                  <p>"And so we have you at last," said one of the men, the<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5727-00000005"/> commander of the party. "Little did I think when I set out on this expedition that I would return with but one hand."</p> 
                  <p>A man, whose figure was concealed by a cloak, now entered the room. On seeing the prisoner, he uttered a cry of joy.</p> 
                  <p>"We have succeeded," said Wyckoff, holding up his arm. "The only thing that consoles me for the loss of my hand, is your promise of promotion."</p> 
                  <p>"And I will keep my word," said the other, who, as the reader may already have suspected, was Gortschakoff. "Take the prisoner to the palace. Do not suffer him to speak, and see that no one approaches him;" and saying this he turned towards the door.</p> 
                  <p>"General Gortschakoff," said the prisoner, "suffer me to ask you one question, and I pledge you my honor that I will not speak to any one, unless it be in answer to your questions."</p> 
                  <p>"Speak then," said the general.</p> 
                  <p>"Who betrayed me?" asked the young man.</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know," replied Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>The prisoner pointed to the old man. "Did he betray me?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I can answer your question," said Major Wyckoff, stepping forward." One of my men saw you enter this house, and he immediately informed me."</p> 
                  <p>"The miller, then, did not betray me?" said the prisoner, interrogatively.</p> 
                  <p>"The miller," repeated Wyckoff, in surprise. "What miller?"</p> 
                  <p>The prisoner turned towards the place where the old man had been standing, but he had disappeared. A look of surprise stole over his features.</p> 
                  <p>"Who, then, was that old man who stood near me when you entered the room?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know," replied Wyckoff. "It was not the miller, of that I am certain, for I know him well. Search the house, men. For all we know he may be a spy."</p> 
                  <p>Several of the men immediately left the room. In a few minutes they returned.</p> 
                  <p>"He has escaped," they said, in answer to the major's inquiring look.</p> 
                  <p>"At any rate we have got what we came for," said the major; "and now, forward."</p> 
                  <p>Again we take the reader to the palace. In the same room where we saw him before, stood the Emperor. At a little distance from him stood several of his officers with uncovered heads. Suddenly the door opened, and General Gortschakoff entered. He was followed by several soldiers bringing with them the prisoner. With a haughty curl of the lip, and an unshaken brow,<pb n=""/> the latter stood before the Emperor, whom no man could look in the face without trembling.</p> 
                  <p>"The prisoner, Charles Handermoff, your Majesty," said General Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>"It is well," said the Emperor. "The knout which we had reserved for you shall be given to the man who now stands before us-that is, if he is proven guilty;" and saying this, the Emperor fixed his eagle eye on the prisoner.</p> 
                  <p>"Of what crime am I accused?" asked the prisoner, boldly.</p> 
                  <p>"He speaks our language well, too well" muttered the Emperor to himself-"and yet, I forgot. Report says that he was brought up amongst us. The dark complexion, those features, every thing about him shows that he belongs not to our faith."</p> 
                  <p>"Your Majesty," said the prisoner, "of what crime am I accused?"</p> 
                  <p>"Your name?" asked the Emperor.</p> 
                  <p>"Men call me Monvau," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Your real name?" asked the Emperor.</p> 
                  <p>"Charles Handermoff."</p> 
                  <p>"Your birthplace?"</p> 
                  <p>"Constantinople," replied the prisoner, proudly.</p> 
                  <p>"Your religion?"</p> 
                  <p>"The crescent. I am a follower of the true faith. I believe that there is but one God, and that Mahomet is his prophet. I am a Mahometan."</p> 
                  <p>On hearing this the Emperor crossed himself. The others, with the exception of the prisoner, did the same.</p> 
                  <p>"You are then a Turk?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am, both in birth and religion."</p> 
                  <p>Why are you here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ask your men, they brought me here. I came against my own will."</p> 
                  <p>"What reasons have you for visiting this country?" asked the Emperor.</p> 
                  <p>The prisoner made no reply.</p> 
                  <p>The Emperor made a threatening gesture with his fingers. The prisoner looked at him with a smile of scorn.</p> 
                  <p>"Answer me," cried the Emperor.</p> 
                  <p>The prisoner folded his arms and made no reply.</p> 
                  <p>"What, dog! dare you beard me here?" cried the Emperor, unable to restrain his passion.</p> 
                  <p>"Dare!" cried the prisoner, the red blood mantling to his cheek. "Aye! I do dare,-Emperor though you are, the Turk scorns you. Listen to the words of one who is looked upon as a prophet among his own people. The war in which you are now about to engage will be your last. In a year you will be without a throne, a beggar upon the earth! the cursed of God<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5727-00000006"/> and man! You will be looked upon as the murderer of millions. Your armies may cross the Danube, but they will never return, for the Turks have sworn upon the grave of Mahomet to spare none! The war that you are now creating, will, instead of a curse, prove a blessing, for it will give freedom to millions! Count not upon the aid of others. Prussia will not help you; Austria dare not, and the nations whom you count the most on, instead of fighting for you, will fight against you. Already, France and England have joined together, and soon their armies will be here to do you battle. The Cossacks of the plains will fight against you. The mountaineers of Circassia have offered us their aid. Your destiny has been written; it cannot be changed. Powerful when young, powerless when old! Like one stricken with some dread disease you will wander over the earth. No one will dare to help the ex-emperor. Millions will shout with joy over your degradation, and none will mourn the fate of the once powerful Nicholas of Russia!"</p> 
                  <p>He paused. So surprised were his hearers that for a few moments not a word was spoken. Nicholas was the first to recover from his surprise, but ere he could speak, the Turk again spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"You have asked me my reasons for coming here. I will tell you, but believe me, it is not from fear that I do it. I left my sunny land for this cold clime to discover your plans. I have succeeded, and ere now the plans of your fortifications, the number of your men, and, in fact, everything that you intend to do, are in the hands of the Sultan. Nicholas, if one Turk can do all this, what may not a million do?"</p> 
                  <p>"We shall see," said the Emperor. "Take this man to the darkest and deepest dungeon of the prison: chain him hand and foot; and hark ye, Major Wyckoff, I place him under your guard. If he escapes, the knout and the axe shall be yours."</p> 
                  <p>The major made a low bow; and at a signal from him, his men surrounded the prisoner. With slow and solemn steps they left the room, and descended the stairs to the street. Ten minutes' walk brought them to the prison. The major tapped on the gate with the handle of his sword, and then awaited impatiently for it to open.</p> 
                  <p>"So this is to be my residence," said the prisoner, with a bitter smile. "How long am I to remain here?"</p> 
                  <p>Before any one could reply, a loud hooting like the crying of an owl was heard. Before any one could prevent him, the prisoner had answered it three times.</p> 
                  <p>"Be prepared, men, for an attack," cried the major.</p> 
                  <p>"Calm your fears," said the prisoner, "there will be no attack. Ah!" he muttered to himself, "I little thought that I had friends so near me."</p> 
                  <p>The gates were now opened, and the party entered the prison.<pb n=""/> After ascending and descending several pair of stairs, they stopped before a large iron door. The major drew a large key from his pocket and inserted it into the lock. He then tried to turn it but was unsuccessful.</p> 
                  <p>"This door has been opened so seldom that the lock has grown rusty," said the major.</p> 
                  <p>"Let me try it," said Handermoff. "Two hands are better than one."</p> 
                  <p>"Try it then," said the major, standing back.</p> 
                  <p>Handermoff laid his hands upon the key, and apparently tried with all his strength to push it back.</p> 
                  <p>"I have so little room," said he, "that I can do nothing."</p> 
                  <p>"Stand back, men, and give him a little elbow room," said the major.</p> 
                  <p>So the men obeyed the order. Handermoff thrust his hand into his bosom, and drawing forth a small phial he pushed it into the key hole. So rapidly was this done, that the men saw it not.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, have you succeeded?" asked Wyckoff.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," replied Handermoff, as he gave the key a sudden turn. The door flew open and they entered the cell.</p> 
                  <p>"What, is this to be my prison?" cried Handermoff, as he gazed around on the bare walls. "Why there is not even a bed for me to lie on. I cannot live in such a place?"</p> 
                  <p>"Better, far better that you should die here than meet the Emperor again," said Wyckoff. "Besides, a bed could be of no use to you. You forget that you are to be chained hand and foot."</p> 
                  <p>"Truly, I forgot," said the other; "but surely you will not execute the order of your cruel master."</p> 
                  <p>"I must," said Wyckoff. "I dread the knout too much to disobey him."</p> 
                  <p>Without uttering a single word, the prisoner suffered his hands and feet to be chained. When this was done, the soldiers left him, locking the door behind them.</p> 
                  <p>"Could I but get these chains off my hands," murmured Handermoff, "I would call myself a free man. The inside of the lock is already destroyed. Little do they think that I can press back the bolt with my finger. Nitric acid acts very quick on rusty iron."</p> 
                  <p>The thoughts of the prisoner now took another turn.</p> 
                  <p>"Who was that that signaled to me just now? Perhaps it was Achemet. If so, I am saved," and murmuring a few words more he fell asleep.</p> 
                  <p>Several hours passed ere he was awakened by the bolt turning in the lock. The light of a torch flashed upon his face. Thinking it was the jailor, he turned his head towards the door. To his great surprise he beheld Stractkoff.</p> 
                  <p>"Hush," said the latter, placing his fingers on his lip. "I have<pb n="24-25 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000007"/> good news for you, news that will revive your drooping spirits."</p> 
                  <p>"Who are you?" said Handermoff. "I know you only under the name of Stractkoff. Is that your real name or an assumed one?"</p> 
                  <p>"Look;" cried the latter, holding the torch close to his face, and throwing off his false beard. With a cry of astonishment, Handermoff ejaculated "Omer Pacha."</p> 
                  <p>"Hush," cried the other, as he bent his ear towards the floor. After listening several moments, he turned to Handermoff.</p> 
                  <p>"I am indeed your general," he said; "and I have come to save you. Without the gate there is waiting one whose name would put the strength of a thousand men in your single arm. Need I tell her name?"</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Her</emph> name!" cried Handermoff. "What, can it be Marritta?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes it is Marritta. But you must not see her now. The meeting would be too much for your exhausted strength to bear. Believe me, I would gladly consent to your meeting, but it must be otherwise."</p> 
                  <p>"And can I not escape from hence?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, it is impossible. It would take five hours to remove the chains even if I had a file."</p> 
                  <p>"But I have the means, "cried Handermoff, eagerly. "Nitric acid will eat away the iron."</p> 
                  <p>"But these chains are of steel, and nitric acid will not act on steel."</p> 
                  <p>"So there is no hope," murmured Handermoff.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, there is hope," cried Pacha. To morrow you will be removed from this dungeon to the one at Pskov. On the road we will rescue you."</p> 
                  <p>"We" repeated Handermoff, eagerly.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, we," replied the other. Achemet and a small party of men are in the woods just outside of the city. The Russians, not suspecting an attack, will be defeated; and then we will have you safe amongst us again."</p> 
                  <p>"How did you gain admittance into the prison?" asked Handermoff.</p> 
                  <p>"Very easily. I bribed the jailor."</p> 
                  <p>"But he may betray you."</p> 
                  <p>"No, he will not," said Pacha. "I promised him a hundred sequins when I stood safe outside the gate."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps for a larger sum he would unlock these chains," said Handermoff.</p> 
                  <p>"I have tried him on that point," said Pacha; "but he has not the keys. They are in the possession of Major Wyckoff."</p> 
                  <p>How I long to be free," said Handermoff, with a sigh.</p> 
                  <p>"Free you shall be," said the other. "When the sun sets tomorrow, you will either be a free man or I shall be dead."</p>

                  <p>"No, no," said Handermoff, eagerly: "rather let me die than that you should peril your life for my sake. Remember, the Sultan has need of you."</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens!" said Pacha, "your words only make me the more determined; and I am more than half resolved to attempt your freedom this night. Yes," he continued, speaking to himself, "it would, indeed, be a bold act for me to attack this prison. It would give the Turks the more courage to think that they have for their commander, a man who dared to attempt the liberation of a fellow-soldier in the very heart of the Emperor's dominions-in fact, within one hundred yards of the Emperor himself-and that too with but twenty men. I'll do it," and he strode towards the door.</p> 
                  <p>"No, no," cried Hendermoff, as he attempted to rise, "do not attempt it. The lives of a thousand like me are not worth yours. Think, the eyes of all Europe, and indeed, America, are turned upon you. The hopes of the Sultan and the Turks rest upon you. Think then, how they would curse me were you to die in attempting my liberation."</p> 
                  <p>"Still, it would be a glorious deed," said Pacha, "a deed worthy of the fame-"</p> 
                  <p>Before he could conclude the sentence the gaoler sprang into the room.</p> 
                  <p>"Quick, quick-to the gate," said he, pushing Omar towards the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Adieu, Handermoff," said Pacha, extinguishing the torch. "We meet to-morrow," and he left the room.</p> 
                  <p>In vain did Handermoff close his eyes, he could not sleep. Impatiently he awaited the coming of the morn. At length a single ray of light peeped through the bars of his prison; he hailed it with a cry of joy. Soon the rising sun shone full in his face. Several hours passed and no one appeared.</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot bear this agony of suspense much longer," said he, as he attempted to change his position. Hardly had the words been spoken when a heavy footstep was heard approaching, and the door flew open. Handermoff raised his head and beheld the Emperor.</p> 
                  <p>For several moments both gazed at each other without speaking. At length, as though tired of silence, the Emperor waved his hand, and Wyckoff entered.</p> 
                  <p>"You have obeyed my orders to the very letter," said the Emperor. Unloosen his chains."</p> 
                  <p>Wyckoff drew a key from his pocket and did as he was desired.</p> 
                  <p>"Handermoff," said the Emperor, "you have had a taste of our dungeons. Could you remain here a week and live?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," replied the young man, "three nights more and death would claim another victim."</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"This dungeon compared with one at Pskov is a paradise," said the Emperor. "It remains wholly with you whether you are to occupy it or not."</p> 
                  <p>Handermoff gazed at the Emperor with surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"Suppose," said the Emperor, "that I were to offer you the commission of a general: what would be your answer?"</p> 
                  <p>"See you these bare walls? See you these chains? Breathe you the foul air of this dungeon? Sooner would I rot in this living grave than accept your offer. Aye, Nicholas of Russia, the Turk, poor and unknown as he is, spurns your offer. Sooner than turn traitor to my God and country, I would endure the most fearful agonies that your fertile brain can invent. Think not to make me change my mind. No power on earth can do it, not even Nicholas of Russia."</p> 
                  <p>"I have heard you patiently," said the Emperor, "and it is now my turn. Charles Handermoff, I have sworn upon the grave of my father, to carry on the war with Turkey, so long as I can raise an arm. I have sworn that your country shall be mine. Remember, Nicholas of Russia knows not the meaning of the word fail. I have more men and money than England and France can boast of. Your country is impoverished. Your Sultan is without money. The Turks are cowards. How, then, can you expect to carry on the war? and even should you succeed in defeating me, your country will be worse off than she was before, for England and France will divide the spoils, and most probably your Sultan will be left without a house to shelter him, or a nation to support him."</p> 
                  <p>"The United States will-"</p> 
                  <p>"Do nothing. She is jealous of England. Already have they quarreled about the island of Cuba. I, by the aid of my money and agents, will fan the quarrel into a flame, and the flame into a war. Everything goes against you. Remember, I have sworn to carry on the war, and nothing but death will cause me to break my oath."</p> 
                  <p>"Then death let it be!" cried Handermoff, as he sprang forward and drew the Emperor's dagger from the sheath. To his surprise the Emperor made no attempt to defend himself, and as he gave the blow he smiled.</p> 
                  <p>"The fate of my ancestor told me to be prepared for assassins," said Nicholas, as he opened his shirt and disclosed a coat of mail. "This attempt, young man, has sealed your doom. Away with him to the dungeon at Pskov; and hark ye, major, see that no food is given him. Let him die of starvation," and with a cold smile he left the cell.</p> 
                  <p>"You did wrong in attempting his life," said Wyckoff, as soon as the sound of the Emperor's footsteps had died away.</p> 
                  <p>"Would that I had succeeded," said Handermoff bitterly; "but<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5727-00000009"/> never mind. Although my arm has failed, the arm of another may not," and he sank upon the floor.</p> 
                  <p>Wyckoff now left the room. Handermoff made no attempt to escape. The scenes of the past hour had <choice>
                        <sic>weakenened</sic>
                        <corr>weakened</corr>
                     </choice> him so much that he was unable to rise. Soon, Wyckoff, followed by several soldiers, entered the cell.</p> 
                  <p>"You must prepare for a journey," said Wyckoff. "I am sorry that you are under my charge, for should you escape, my doom from that moment is sealed. Get up, for we have a long distance to go and I prefer traveling by daylight than darkness. Come, we must be moving."</p> 
                  <p>"Lift me up," said the young man, as he attempted in vain to rise to his feet. Pitying his condition, one of the soldiers drew out a flask of brandy, and poured about one half the contents down his throat. In an instant Handermoff felt like a new man.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you," said he to the soldier, "I can walk now."</p> 
                  <p>"Forward, then," said Wyckoff, and they left the cell. On reaching the street, Handermoff was accosted by the Emperor.</p> 
                  <p>"Accept my offer ere it is too late," said he, "your answer, quick."</p> 
                  <p>"The same as before," was the proud reply.</p> 
                  <p>"You will regret this ere three days have passed," said the Emperor.</p> 
                  <p>"I may, and I may not," said Handermoff as he mounted the horse that one of the soldiers held by the bridle.</p> 
                  <p>For a few minutes the Emperor silently examined the features of the prisoner, as though hoping that he would change his mind at the last moment. Handermoff returned the gaze with a smile of scorn. With a sudden effort to repress his rising anger, the Emperor left the spot.</p> 
                  <p>"Place the prisoner in the center, and keep him there," said Wyckoff, "and now, forward!"</p> 
                  <p>An hour's ride brought them to the outskirts of the city. Before them extended a long line of unbroken woods, many miles in length. After proceeding many miles in silence, Wyckoff spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"These woods," said he, "extend over three hundred miles. We must travel at least fifty miles before we reach our stopping place for the night."</p> 
                  <p>"I presume," said Handermoff, "that this is not the first time that you have traveled over this road."</p> 
                  <p>"No, far from it," replied Wyckoff, and they rode along in silence. Handermoff was too much engrossed with his own thoughts to break the silence.</p> 
                  <p>Hardly had the sun disappeared in the west when they reached the stopping place. It was an inn. The house was so old that it appeared in danger of falling at any moment. As the horses<pb n=""/> stopped at the door, the mistress, a tall, raw-boned, masculine looking woman, came forth.</p> 
                  <p>"We wish to remain here for the night," said Wyckoff; "I bear the Emperor's order. Look," and he drew a seal from his pocket.</p> 
                  <p>"You are welcome," said the woman. "Houch," she cried, clapping her hands,</p> 
                  <p>A short, fat, sleepy looking man came out, and without <choice>
                        <sic>nttering</sic>
                        <corr>uttering</corr>
                     </choice> a word, or bestowing even a glance on the travelers, he proceeded to water the horses.</p> 
                  <p>"I perceive that you have lost a hand since you were here last," said the woman; "How came you to lose it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ask that gentleman," said Wyckoff, pointing to Handermoff. On seeing him, the woman made a slight start.</p> 
                  <p>"How was it that Major Wyckoff lost his hand?" said the woman as she approached our hero. "Here, take this," she whispered, as she thrust a paper into his hand; "do not suffer any one to see it," and saying this she left him.</p> 
                  <p>Handermoff approached the window and looked out. Seizing an opportunity, he drew forth the paper and read:-</p> 
                  <p>"Do not sleep to-night. Be prepared to move at the slightest signal. Your friends are near you. O. P."</p> 
                  <p>"Let them come when they will," said Handermoff to himself, and he turned from the window and threw himself into a chair.</p> 
                  <p>An hour passed ere the hostess announced that "supper was ready."</p> 
                  <p>Handermoff ate but little. He made no reply to the numerous questions that Wyckoff put to him. The hostess, too, tried to engage him in conversation, but failed. When the meal was finished, Handermoff expressed a wish to retire.</p> 
                  <p>"Where do you intend to put him to-night," asked Wyckoff, of the hostess, as she was about to leave the room.</p> 
                  <p>"In the usual place," replied the woman, with a strange smile. "No one can escape from that room so long as the bars are strong, and my sleeping place is beneath it."</p> 
                  <p>"Lock him in and bring me the key," said Wyckoff, "or stay; I will go with you and make sure that the prisoner is locked in," and he arose from his chair.</p> 
                  <p>Hardly had he reached the staircase, when the report of a gun was heard, and he fell to the floor. The soldiers started up in terror.</p> 
                  <p>"Secure-the-prisoner," said Wyckoff, in a choking voice.</p> 
                  <p>Several of the men sprang upon Handermoff, and bore him to the floor.</p> 
                  <p>"Fasten-the door," murmured Wyckoff, as he laid his hand on the wound.</p> 
                  <p>One of the men stepped forward to obey the order, but ere he<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5727-00000010"/> could reach the door, another report was heard, and with a loud cry of agony he fell dead upon the floor.</p> 
                  <p>With terror stricken countenances, the soldiers gazed on each other. They felt that they were doomed men. How to escape they knew not. Instinctively they turned to their leader, as though hoping that he would aid them.</p> 
                  <p>"I am dying, comrades," said Wyckoff, as he raised himself on his elbow, and gazed wildly about him. Suddenly his head fell back-a convulsive movement-and he was dead.</p> 
                  <p>Handermoff now made a violent effort to throw off his assailants, and succeeded; he then sprang to the door. Before he could reach it, it was burst open, and twelve or fourteen men entered the room. Their dark complexions and dresses showed that they were Turks.</p> 
                  <p>"Cut them down? Spare none but the prisoner," cried the foremost, as with a blow of his heavy sabre he cut down one of the Russians who attempted to grapple with him.</p> 
                  <p>With loud cries of "Il Allah! Il Allah!" the Turks rushed forward. In vain did the Russians attempt to defend themselves; they were soon overpowered. As the last one fell, one of the Turks seized a torch and applied it to the curtains. In an instant the room was in a blaze.</p> 
                  <p>"Their battle ground shall be their grave," cried the Turk who had set fire to the room. "To the door, men, and permit none to leave the house excepting those belonging to our company and Handermoff."</p> 
                  <p>"And me," cried the hostess, as she sprang forward.</p> 
                  <p>"True; I forgot you," said the Turk, and he followed his men from the house. Hardly had they reached the green plat in front of the house when the hostess' features turned as pale as death, and her lips trembled so that she could scarcely speak.</p> 
                  <p>"What is it?" asked one of the Turks, who saw by her manner that she wished to speak to him.</p> 
                  <p>The woman pointed to the house and attempted to reply. She could not; her tongue was paralyzed with terror.</p> 
                  <p>"What is it?" again cried the Turk: "speak, woman!"</p> 
                  <p>The hostess seized him by the arm and pushed him towards the woods.</p> 
                  <p>"Omer Pacha!" she cried, suddenly recovering the use of her tongue, "the house is filled with powder and-"</p> 
                  <p>Before she could proceed farther, a dull heavy sound, followed by a terrific explosion, was heard. The house had blown up. All of the Turks, with the exception of Omer Pacha and Handermoff were killed. The latter received a severe blow in the face. The force of the explosion was so great that it caused the ground to open several feet, and from the opening there burst a large stream of water. Before the two men could get out of the way,<pb n=""/> the chasm had been filled up, and the water was rapidly approaching them. Its force was so great that several rocks weighing many tons were turned completely over by it. The two men, thinking that their hour had come, fell on their knees, and repeated aloud the confession of their faith. "There is but one God, and Mahomet is his prophet," cried Handermoff as the water covered his feet. "God help us, for all is lost!" cried the Pacha: "we will die together," he added, as he flung his arms around the other's neck. The waters rolled past them and they sank beneath the surface. The love of life which God has implanted in the heart of every human being caused them to release their hold of each other, and they rose to the surface. Both were expert swimmers, but what could they do against the fury of the current. Again they sank, and again did they rise to the surface. Finding that his strength was gone, Handermoff raised his head to take a last look at the sky: a loud shout caused him to turn his face towards the woods. Within twenty yards of him he saw a female on horseback, rapidly making her way towards him. On seeing her face, he uttered a cry of joy, and murmured the name of "Marritta." On hearing that name, Pacha raised his head.</p> 
                  <p>"We are saved!" he shouted, as he half sprung out of the water. With frantic haste Marritta urged on her steed, and as she drew near the men, she cried:-</p> 
                  <p>"Seize the pommel of the saddle, and keep a tight hold on it."</p> 
                  <p>The men obeyed. Each felt that on his hold depended his life.</p> 
                  <p>"Are you ready?" cried Marritta as she raised her whip.</p> 
                  <p>"Ready!" shouted the two men, and the horse dashed forward. In a few minutes they reached the woods. Five minutes more and they were on the dry land.</p> 
                  <p>"Handermoff," cried Marritta, as the young man embraced her, "talk not of love now. Away with it, and put on the courage of a lion. The enemy are around us, and we cannot escape without cutting our way through. Remember the war cry of our nation, and if you fall, fall with your dagger in the heart of your enemy, and let your last words be the name of the Sultan, and the confession of our faith."</p> 
                  <p>"But I have no arms," cried Handermoff.</p> 
                  <p>"Are our horses in the same place where we left them?" asked Pacha.</p> 
                  <p>Without making any answer to the question, Marritta touched her horse with the whip and the animal darted forward. Soon they were lost to view in the thickest of the woods.</p> 
                  <p>"Where has she gone?" asked Handermoff, in surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"After our horses, no doubt," replied Pacha.</p> 
                  <pb n="32-33 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000011"/> 
                  <p>He was right. In a few minutes she returned, leading two horses by the bridles. Across the pummel of her saddle was a small silken banner. As she reached the men, she raised the banner high above her head, and with a cry of enthusiasm exclaimed, as she pointed to the Crescent, "Behold the banner of the Ottomans?"</p> 
                  <p>"This banner," said Pacha, as he took it from her, "was made by the Sultan's favorite wife. When I received it from her I swore to dye it in the blood of our enemies. Aye! I swore it, and Omer Pacha has never been known to break his oath," and touching the crescent with his finger, he gave back the banner to Marritta.</p> 
                  <p>"It was made by a woman's hands; let it be carried in the thickest of the fight by the lover of the Prophet," said he, as he sprang upon his horse. "Come, Handermoff, your horse is waiting for you."</p> 
                  <p>The young man gave one last look at the inn, or rather what was left of it, and sprang into the saddle. To his great joy, he discovered a sabre fastened to one of the holsters.</p> 
                  <p>"How lucky that we took only our guns with us when we attacked the inn," said Pacha, as he drew a pair of pistols from the holster, and keenly examined the flints.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, it was lucky that you acted upon my advice," said Marritta; "but our poor comrades, where are they now?"</p> 
                  <p>"Dead," said Pacha, covering his face with his hand; "they lie beneath the wave; but fear not, I will avenge their death. And now let us forward."</p> 
                  <p>For several miles they rode along in silence. They knew that the enemy were around them, and that the slightest noise would betray them. They kept in the shadow of the trees as far as possible. Suddenly, Marritta stopped.</p> 
                  <p>"Hush," said she, in a low voice, "and do what I do," and drawing several pieces of cloth from one of the holsters, she tied them around the horse's hoofs. The others imitated her example in silence.</p> 
                  <p>"We are in the most dangerous part of the woods," said Marritta, and they again moved forward. "Keep your arms ready," said she, as they emerged into an open place. Hardly had the words been spoken when they heard a loud howl so near them that it caused them to start back in terror.</p> 
                  <p>"It is the wolves!" shouted Pacha in a tone of horror, and giving their horses the spur they dashed along the ground with the rapidity of lightning. Suddenly Pacha's horse stumbled and fell.</p> 
                  <p>"Mount behind me, quick!" cried Handermoff, as by the bright moonlight he saw a huge wolf springing towards them. In an instant Pacha was in the saddle and again they dashed forward. The horses seemed to know that the lives of their<pb n=""/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5727-00000012"/> riders depended upon them, and every moment they increased their speed. Soon the howling of the wolves grew fainter and fainter, and when they again entered the woods it had entirely died away.</p> 
                  <p>"What a narrow escape," said Pacha, as he wiped the perspiration from his brow with the back of his hand. "Sooner would I face a thousand men than fall into the fangs of a wolf, especially at this season of the year.</p> 
                  <p>"Let us stop a few minutes," said Marritta. "Our horses are tired, and it will not do for us to fatigue them too much. We have a long journey before us, and should we lose our horses Heaven only knows whether we would reach our country in safety."</p> 
                  <p>"Keep in the shadow of the trees," said Pacha. "Do not dismount, for it will be dangerous for us to leave our horses."</p> 
                  <p>"Would that we were safe in our own country," said Marritta.</p> 
                  <p>"Hush," said Pacha, "somebody is coming;" and he glided behind a tree. The others imitated his example.</p> 
                  <p>"There is no one," said Handermoff, after they had waited a few minutes in anxious silence.</p> 
                  <p>"A false alarm," said Pacha, with a smile. "And now let us be moving."</p> 
                  <p>They had scarcely proceeded a dozen yards when three men sprang out from behind a tree, and caught their horses by the bridles.</p> 
                  <p>"Surrender!" cried one, as he pointed a large, formidable looking pistol at Handermoff. Without a word, and with a movement rapid as lightning, the latter drew his sabre and gave the other a blow across the head that felled him to the ground. He then flew to the aid of Marritta, but before he could reach her, she had drawn a pistol and shot her assailant dead.</p> 
                  <p>On seeing the fate of his companions, the other flew towards the woods, which he managed to reach in safety.</p> 
                  <p>"Robbers, I presume," said Pacha, as they again started forward. They had not proceeded more than twenty rods before they saw three horses tied to a tree.</p> 
                  <p>"These horses appear to be fresh, while ours are weary," said Pacha. "Let us change." And springing to the ground, he untied one of the animals and mounted him. As he did so, he uttered a cry of joy.</p> 
                  <p>"Dismount," said he, "these horses are of the Arabian breed, the best animals in the world. They will carry us twice as far in one day as ours will."</p> 
                  <p>In five minutes, Marritta and our hero were mounted on the two horses. In one of the saddle-bags they found a supply of food, and several small flasks of wine.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"Your health," said Pacha, with a smile, and raising one of the flasks to his lips he poured the contents down his throat.</p> 
                  <p>"The best I ever tasted," said he, throwing the bottle upon the ground, "and now, suppose we remain here a few hours and rest ourselves."</p> 
                  <p>"Rather let us ride forward a few miles further," said Marritta. "Remember, every step we take brings us nearer our own country."</p> 
                  <p>"True," said Pacha, and again they rode forward. Several hours passed and not a word was spoken on either side. At length they reached a small spring. Here they stopped to water their horses.</p> 
                  <p>"If nothing happens," said Pacha, as he drew a small map from his pocket, "we shall soon reach the banks of the Dnieper."</p> 
                  <p>"Let us stay here a few hours," said Handermoff. "Marritta is tired. See, she can scarcely keep herself from falling."</p> 
                  <p>"Let it be so, then," said Pacha, as he tied his horse to a tree. When this was done, he threw himself upon the ground. The others imitated his example, and soon they were all fast asleep.</p> 
                  <p>The sun had not risen five minutes ere they were awake. After washing themselves at the spring they drew out the food from the saddle-bag. The long journey had given them a good appetite, and they enjoyed their meal the better for it. As soon as the meal was finished they mounted their horses, and again rode forward.</p> 
                  <p>At noon they reached the banks of the Dnieper. Pacha hailed a schooner, and offered the captain a large sum to take them to the Black Sea. The captain consented, and in four days they reached the city of Cherson. Here they were obliged to land and take to the woods, for fear that the vessel would be searched. In three days they reached Odessa. Here they remained for several days.</p> 
                  <p>One day as they were seated in the dining room of the inn, the landlord entered and in a hurried voice informed them that a party of the Emperor's soldiers were below, and that they were about to search the house. Pacha slipped a heavy purse into the landlord's hands, and the latter by an underground passage, conducted them to the woods. Here they found their horses tied to a tree. The landlord pointed out the road to Bender, and then left them. In three days they readied the town. As Pacha was acquainted with the landlord of the inn, he felt no apprehensions of treachery. The landlord appeared to be greatly pleased on seeing them and immediately conducted them to a secret room in the roof. When night came they set out for Ismail, and in five days they crossed the Danube. They were now safe in their own country.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <p>It was a clear, pleasant afternoon, January the 3d, 1854, that on the road leading to the town of Citale, might have been seen a body of troops numbering in all fifteen thousand men. The numerous flags in their midst showed that they were Turks. The army was divided into six divisions, each division numbering two thousand five hundred men. In the center of each division was a huge banner with a half moon stamped on it. The men were well armed, and appeared to be very happy. Some were mounted on horseback, but by far the greater number were on foot. In the center of the third division were fifteen pieces of artillery. At the head of the first division rode the commander-in-chief, Omer Pacha. Close behind him followed several of his officers, who were gaily chatting with each other. They heeded not the presence of their commander, for they knew that he would not interrupt them. While on the road, the men had permission to talk with each other as much as they pleased, and they, of course, took advantage of this permission.</p> 
                  <p>Behind the last division followed several hundred wagons. These were loaded with provisions, tents, and everything that was needful for the benefit of the army.</p> 
                  <p>"Yonder," said one of the officers, as he pointed with his sword in the direction of the town, "yonder lies Citale. We are advancing towards it with joyful spirits, brave hearts, and a good commander. How will we leave it?"</p> 
                  <pb n="36-37 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000013"/> 
                  <p>"As conquerers," said another. "Rest assured that although we came off second best at Sinope, it will not be the case with this place."</p> 
                  <p>"Think you that our commander will attack the place to-night?" asked another.</p> 
                  <p>"No, I do not," was the reply. "Gen. Pacha is too good a general to allow his weary troops to attack a place so strongly fortified as Citale, without giving them a short rest. At any rate, I prefer attacking the place to-night. I feel so ferocious that I could eat a dozen Russians for supper, and about the same number for my breakfast."</p> 
                  <p>"Ugh," said one of the officers, with an exclamation of disgust. "Your words are enough to make one sick."</p> 
                  <p>All the officers burst into a loud laugh.</p> 
                  <p>"The Russians seem to be prepared for us," said another of the officers, as he drew out his spy glass, and raised it to his eye. "We will have to fight hard to get possession of that place."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps so," said another. "I hope the general will make us a speech before we attack the place. Ten words from him make the Turks fight like devils."</p> 
                  <p>"I wonder what has become of Handermoff," said another. "I have not seen him for several days."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps the general sent him with a message to the Sultan. He appears to be a favorite with him."</p> 
                  <p>"And deservedly so," said another, warmly. "Although I have only known the young man a few weeks, I love him as though he were my brother."</p> 
                  <p>"Say rather that you love his sister," said another.</p> 
                  <p>"His sister!" repeated the other, in a tone of surprise. "Do you mean the female that carries the banner?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes; is she not his sister?"</p> 
                  <p>"No."</p> 
                  <p>"His wife, perhaps?"</p> 
                  <p>"Neither one nor the other."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! see how it is," said the other with a smile. "How strange that I did not see it before."</p> 
                  <p>"You are mistaken in your supposition. She is not his mistress."</p> 
                  <p>"How queer it is that the Turks entertain the idea that women have no souls," said the one who had first spoken.</p> 
                  <p>"Very strange," said another.</p> 
                  <p>"What a pity it is that Omer Pacha is not a Frenchman."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, it is a pity," said another. "It was very kind of him to give us a command in his army."</p> 
                  <p>"He would not have done so were it not that we understand surveying."</p> 
                  <p>"How lucky it is that we all rank alike."</p> 
                  <p>"Why so?" exclaimed several.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, were one higher in rank than another, we would be quarreling with each other all the time."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the general reined in his horse, and waited for the others to approach.</p> 
                  <p>"Gentlemen," said he, "although a general, I am not ashamed to ask your advice. Will it be the best for us to encamp on the right or left hand of the city, or on that rising piece of ground?"</p> 
                  <p>"Choose the latter, by all means," said one of the officers. "Although it is within reach of the enemy's balls, we shall be better able to stand our ground in case of an attack.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you think of it?" asked Pacha, of another.</p> 
                  <p>"Choose the latter-"</p> 
                  <p>His speech was suddenly cut short by a musket bullet, and he fell from his horse. One of his comrades sprang from his horse and bent over him.</p> 
                  <p>"Armoot," said he, "where are you hurt?"</p> 
                  <p>"In the breast. Tell my father that I died facing the enemy." And with a low groan he expired.</p> 
                  <p>"He is dead," said the other, as he wiped a tear from his eye.</p> 
                  <p>"Such is the fate of war," said the general, in a musing tone. "How many, like him, will be cut off in the flower of their youth. What will his parents think-what agony will they suffer when they hear that their only son is dead-but away with these thoughts. What have I to do with them? What right have they to<pb n=""/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5727-00000014"/> enter a soldier's bosom?" and putting spurs into his horse, he rode towards the first division.</p> 
                  <p>"Pass the word along the line to halt," he said, and in an instant that dark moving mass was as motionless as death. Drawing his sword, the general pointed to the town of Citale and cried-"Behold the town that we are about to attack. The first gun has been fired: the first victim has fallen. Within three days the flag that is now waving on yonder wall shall come down, and the crescent shall take its place. Show no mercy, for should we be defeated we need expect none. But we shall not be defeated. The general who commands you has sworn never to turn his back to the foe. Within three days that place shall be ours, or your general will have ceased to live."</p> 
                  <p>In spite of all their efforts to prevent it, a loud cheer burst from the Turks. The general smiled as he saw the effect that his words had upon them.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes the order was given to break ranks, and before two hours had passed all of the tents had been put up. In company with his officers, the general approached as near to the town as he could without endangering the safety of his officers. After a short consultation it was resolved that the town should be attacked on the eastern side. When the consultation was over, the general and his officers retired to the encampment, where they separated for the night.</p> 
                  <p>When the sun disappeared in the west, sentinels were stationed on all sides of the encampment. Numerous were the orders that were given them not to let any one leave the encampment or enter it without the watchword. When this had been done to his satisfaction, the general retired to his tent, but not to sleep. From a small iron chest that stood in one corner of the tent he drew several papers and attentively examined them. One of them was a map of the country, the others were letters from the Sultan. After perusing them attentively, a smile of satisfaction stole over his features. "I was sure of it," he murmured, as he leaned with his elbow upon the table. For above an hour he remained in deep thought; and then rising from the table he threw himself upon the bed.</p> 
                  <p>It was about nine o'clock in the evening, when the sentinel who was stationed on the right hand side of the encampment saw, or thought he saw, the outline of a tall figure creeping along the ground. Not wishing to disturb the other sentinels, he silently cocked his gun, and pointed it in the direction of the figure. Hardly had he done this when the figure arose from the ground and approached him.</p> 
                  <p>"Stand back," said the sentinel, as he laid his hand on the trigger. "Who are you-give the password."</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know it," said the other, as he continued to approach. "I have something of importance to say to you. Something that concerns the safety of your general."</p> 
                  <p>"What is it?" asked the sentinel, as he let fall his musket.</p> 
                  <p>"Bend your head-no one must hear me," said the other, and as the sentinel did as he desired he drew a knife and plunged it into his body. He then gave the body a kick on one side, and bending his head he listened attentively.</p> 
                  <p>"All is silent," he muttered, as he replaced the knife in his belt, and throwing himself upon his knees, he crept slowly forward in the direction of the general's tent.</p> 
                  <p>Hardly had he disappeared in the darkness, when a man sprung out from behind a tree, and followed him. Little did the assassin think that he was followed. Silently he crept along the ground, keeping all the while in the shade so as to escape observation. Soon he reached the tent. Here he paused, and laying his ear on the ground he listened attentively. All was still. With a low chuckle of gratification he drew his knife and cutting a slit in the tent large enough to admit himself he passed through. There was but one lamp burning, and that was standing on the table close to the general's bedside. Rapidly yet noiselessly the assassin approached the bed and drew back the curtains. The heavy breathing told him that the general slept. The assassin laid his hand on the lamp and stood for a moment as though undecided. At length slowly raising the lamp he held it before the general's face, and eagerly scanned his features. A savage smile passed over his countenance as he laid the lamp on the table and drew his dagger. Raising the weapon high above his head, he grasped the general by the throat and awoke him. The latter was so surprised at being awakened so suddenly that he made no attempt to resist.</p> 
                  <p>"Minion of the Sultan!" cried the assassin, as he again drew back his arm to give the blow. The general closed his eyes and thought his last hour was come. But the blow fell not, and he opened his eyes. To his surprise he saw the assassin<pb n=""/> struggling with another person on the floor. The light of the lamp was too feeble for him to distinguish his features. Fiercely they rolled over the floor, the assassin trying to regain his knife which he had dropped in the scuffle, and the other striving with all his strength to prevent him; the assassin succeeded however. It was then that the general thought of going to the assistance of his preserver. Before he could reach him, however, the assassin had managed to regain his feet. With a loud cry of baffled rage he sprang upon the general. The latter managed to grasp his wrist, and with a sudden exertion of his superior strength he forced back his arm, and giving it a sudden twist he dislocated it. With a loud cry of agony the assassin fell to the floor. In falling he upset the table on which the lamp had stood, and in an instant the tent was in a blaze. Unheeding it, the general threw himself upon the assassin and strove to prevent him from escaping. The assassin made some fearful attempts to escape, and at length he succeeded. Hardly had he disappeared when several of the soldiers sprang through the flames into the tent.</p> 
                  <p>"Pursue him!" cried the general, pointing in the direction which the assassin had taken. "Pursue him! and if you take him bring him to me. What! Handermoff, and was it you that saved my life?-but no words now-pursue him!" and seizing his sword the general rushed from the tent.</p> 
                  <p>By this time the whole camp was in motion, and it was a very difficult thing to follow the assassin. Handermoff alone managed to get upon the right track. The assassin took a direction towards the town of Citale. Fiercely did the avenger follow on his track. Several times Handermoff laid his hands on him, but still he managed to elude his grasp. They were now within twenty rods of the town, and Handermoff was almost tempted to give up the chase. The last words of his general, and the desire to avenge the death of the sentinel, made him keep on. Just as the man reached the gate, he sprang upon him, and a short and violent struggle ensued. Finding that he was getting the worst of it, the man uttered an exclamation for help, and at the same time shouted a few words, the meaning of which was known only to the towns-people. In an instant the gate was flung open and a small body of men came forth. Our hero attempted to rise and defend himself, but ere he could do so several men sprang upon him and dragged him through the gate. Hardly had it closed behind them when several of the soldiers from the Turkish camp came up, and in a few minutes the news was borne to the general, that his favorite, Charles Handermoff, was a prisoner.</p> 
                  <p>On receiving the news the general sent immediately for Marritta. When informed of the capture of her lover by the enemy she sank down into a chair. The general attempted to console her.</p> 
                  <p>"Fear not," said he, "we will have him again ere the rising of to-morrow's sun."</p> 
                  <p>"No, no," said Marritta; "when once a Turk of any consequence falls into the hands of the Russians his doom is sealed."</p> 
                  <p>"It may be so in some cases," said the general, "but they will not dare to hang Handermoff. They know he is my favorite officer, and--"</p> 
                  <p>"So much the worse for him," said Marritta. "Knowing that he is your favorite officer they will hang him the more readily. Poor Charles, I fear that he is already dead," and she covered her face with her hands.</p> 
                  <p>"Let them hang him if they dare," cried Pacha, grasping his sabre, "and oh! they will repent it to their latest breath. They will curse the hour that he fell into their hands. My vengeance may be slow, but it will be sure."</p> 
                  <p>"Aye! 'tis easy to talk of vengeance now, but while you are standing here they may be leading him to execution. Oh! General Pacha, men call you brave-I know that you are brave. Why not attack the town to-night? Your men are impatient to attack the place. Why not gratify them? The longer we delay in attacking the place, the warmer will be our reception. Remember, Charles saved your life at the risk of his own. In obeying your orders he was taken prisoner. Save him, for you alone can save him."</p> 
                  <p>"Marritta, it is <choice>
                        <sic>imposible</sic>
                        <corr>impossible</corr>
                     </choice> for me to attack the place this night," said the general, his lips quivering with emotion. "My men are tired, and they will meet with a strong resistance. The Russians will fight so long as they can raise an arm, for they know what their fate will be if defeated. To-morrow--"</p> 
                  <p>"To-morrow will be too late," said Marritta with a burst of agony; "but as you refuse to save him I must attempt it myself," and springing from her seat she rushed madly from the tent.</p> 
                  <p>Let us return to Handermoff. When the gate closed behind him he was dragged<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5727-00000015"/> through several streets by his captors, who, with exulting shouts opened the door of a large gloomy looking mansion, and bore him up the stairs. The young man made no resistance for he knew that it would be useless. When they reached the top of the stairs, one of the men opened the door of a room and entered closing the door behind him. A profound silence was maintained by his captors. Suddenly the door opened, and the man who had entered before made a sign with his hand, and before our hero had time to speak he was pushed into the room. On raising his head and looking towards the table he saw the well known features of General Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>"What," cried the latter in a tone of joy, "Charles Handermoff. This is indeed a prize. Little did I expect, young man, to meet with you again."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps not," said our hero, quietly; "but you will please to remember that I am a prisoner, and as such by the honor of your nation-if indeed there is any honor in it-you are bound to treat me gently, and to exchange me the first opportunity that offers."</p> 
                  <p>"And think you," said Gortschakoff, "that now I have you safe, I will permit you to go again? No, no, young man, you are mistaken. I know your power over your countrymen, and, believe me, it will be a long time before they see you again."</p> 
                  <p>"I spoke truly when I said there was no honor in a Russian," said Handermoff with a bitter smile: "but there is one thing that you have forgotten, General Gortschakoff, and that is, there is an army encamped within a mile of this place."</p> 
                  <p>"And what can they do?" said Gortschakoff. "Our walls are strong; our men are brave; and they are well armed. If your general takes this place a miracle will have been accomplished."</p> 
                  <p>"Let me tell you what we will do," said Handermoff. "We will batter down your walls, slaughter your men by the thousand, seize your arms and burn your houses. In a week, aye, perhaps sooner, this town will have been burnt to ashes."</p> 
                  <p>"This is sheer folly," said Gortschakoff. "Perhaps you do not know that an army of eighteen thousand men will leave Kavaul to-morrow and advance to our aid. What say you now?"</p> 
                  <p>"Simply that I do not believe you," replied Handermoff, coolly, although in his heart he believed the information to be true.</p> 
                  <p>"I will prove it," said Gortschakoff, clapping his hands. The door opened and the men whom our hero had pursued to the gate of the town entered the room.</p> 
                  <p>"Did any one leave the town yesterday," asked Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "Voutor departed yesterday for Kavaul."</p> 
                  <p>"When did he return?" asked Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>"This morning. He brought us the news that eighteen thousand of our countrymen will leave Kavaul to-morrow to aid us; but I thought that you knew that already."</p> 
                  <p>"So I did," said Gortschakoff, pointing to the door. The man immediately left the room. "You see the information is true after all."</p> 
                  <p>"It may and it may not be true," said Handermoff; "but suppose that the information were true, one Turk is a match for six Russians."</p> 
                  <p>"How so?" asked Gortschakoff, in surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"Because we fight in defense of our native land, to hurl back the invaders of our country, and to defend our religion. You fight because you are forced to do so-because you are obliged to obey the orders of your tyrant. Believe me, General Gortschakoff, before the year has passed you will find that men who fight in defense of their country fight far better than those who are forced to fight merely to gratify the will of a capricious tyrant."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the door opened, and a man entered the room. After whispering a few words to the general he retired.</p> 
                  <p>"I must bid you good evening," said Gortschakoff, "and I may as well inform you to prepare for death. Hope not for mercy, for none will be shown you," and rang a small bell which lay upon the table. In an instant the part of the floor on which our hero was standing sank down, and he found himself in gloomy darkness.</p> 
                  <p>Let us return to Marritta. On leaving the general's tent she instantly proceeded to her own, and throwing up the lid of a huge chest she drew out several uniforms. From among them she picked out one of the kind worn by a Russian soldier. After donning herself in this strange costume, she drew out several small bottles, and proceeded to change the color of her complexion. A false beard and a wig, and the<pb n=""/> transformation was complete. She then drew out several small pistols, together with a dagger, and placed them in her bosom. She then left the tent and walked rapidly in the direction of Citale. On reaching the outskirts of the encampment, she was challenged by a sentinel. A few words passed between them, and the soldier permitted her to pass on. On nearing the town she paused. She had not as yet made up any plan to enter the town. After considering a few minutes, a thought seemed to strike her, and raising her head she thanked Heaven by a look for the timely thought. She then ran swiftly in the direction of the town, and on reaching it she fell down on her knees beside the gate, as though exhausted.</p> 
                  <p>"Help! Open the gate," she cried, as with head bent forward she eagerly listened to hear if any one was stirring.</p> 
                  <p>"Who's there?" shouted a voice from the other side of the gate.</p> 
                  <p>"Let me in," cried Marritta, making her voice appear as rough as possible, "I have important news for the general."</p> 
                  <p>"Let me see how many of you there are," said the man, and mounting the wall he set fire to the rocket which he held in his hand, and looked downward. Seeing there was but one, and that one a Russian, he jumped down and unbarred the gate.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is General Gortschakoff?" asked Marritta, as she entered the town.</p> 
                  <p>"Come with me," said the man, "I will point out to you the house in which he resides; but first I must get somebody to watch the gate," and saying this, he ran off.</p> 
                  <p>"Now that I am in the town," said Marritta, "fortune must guide me. Shall I wait for this man or not? What have I to say to General Gortschakoff? Nothing. It will be better for me to guide myself than be guided by others," and she paused for a moment in deep thought. At length, on raising her head, she saw a man standing near her.</p> 
                  <p>"Comrade," said he, "you appear to be sad."</p> 
                  <p>"The news I received just now is enough to make me sad," said Marritta.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps your mother is dead," said the other.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, that is it," said Marritta.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, comrade," said the Russian, kindly, "it is no use in brooding over our troubles. Your mother is better off where she is, and perhaps she may be looking down upon you and grieving that you take her loss so much to heart. Come, cheer up, and come with me. There's nothing like a good glass of brandy. It makes us forget our troubles. It makes us think that we are in the second heaven. Come with me, comrade, and I'll soon make you forget your loss."</p> 
                  <p>Hardly caring where she went, Marritta followed him. They passed through several streets, and at length the guide stopped in front of a wine house. As he opened the door, the merry sound of laughter, and the jingling of glasses fell upon her ears.</p> 
                  <p>"This is the place," said the guide. "When you pass this door you leave care and trouble outside."</p> 
                  <p>As Marritta entered, several of the soldiers looked up and stared her rudely in the face.</p> 
                  <p>"Hark ye, comrades," said the guide, "this man is under my protection. You all know me, and you all know what I can do. So cease your staring. Dorick, it seems to me by the way you look at my friend that you see something peculiar. What is it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing," replied the other; and as soon as Marritta's back was turned, he whispered to two of his men and they left the house.</p> 
                  <p>"Bring us a bottle of wine, landlord," said Marritta's new acquaintance; "your best, mind you, and make haste about it."</p> 
                  <p>The wine was brought, together with two glasses. The guide poured out a glassfull for himself and another for Marritta.</p> 
                  <p>"Here, comrades," said he, as he raised the glass high above his head, "here is to the health of Nicholas, the Emperor of Russia, the man who has never turned his back to his foe, and never will. Drink, comrades, drink to the health of the Czar," and he drained his glass.</p> 
                  <p>"Your friend does not drink," said one of the men, pointing to Marritta.</p> 
                  <p>"Mind your own business, friend, and leave that of others alone. What is the matter with the wine, don't it suit you?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," said Marritta, glad of any excuse to get from drinking the toast.</p> 
                  <pb n="42-43 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000016"/> 
                  <p>"Well, well, people need not drink unless they like," said the guide. "Perhaps you would like to try a glass of brandy?"</p> 
                  <p>Before Marritta, could reply, the door opened, and three men entered the room. One of them walked up to her, and laying his hand on her shoulder, he said, "The General wants you."</p> 
                  <p>"What for?" asked Marritta.</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know," was the reply. "Come and see.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, this is too bad to rob me of a new acquaintance so soon," said the guide. "What does he want of him?"</p> 
                  <p>"He is suspected of being a spy," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"You may as well go," said the guide: "but fear not, no harm shall happen to you, at least if I can help it. I will accompany you as far as the General's house," and, followed by the three men, Marritta and the guide left the house.</p> 
                  <p>On reaching the General's house, she was taken into the same room in which Handermoff had been not five minutes before. Little did they think that they were within sound of each other's voice. As Marritta entered the room with the three men, the General waved his hand as a sign, and she was left standing in the <choice>

                        <corr>middle</corr>
                     </choice> of the floor.</p> 
                  <p>"Who are you, and what is your name?" asked Gortschakoff, as he examined her countenance attentively.</p> 
                  <p>"What right have you to question me?" said Marritta, as she folded her arms and gazed him sternly in the face.</p> 
                  <p>"The right that every general has to question the soldiers who are under him," replied Gortschakoff; "but you have not answered my questions."</p> 
                  <p>"My name is Ludock. By birth I am a Russian."</p> 
                  <p>"When did you enter the town?" asked the general. Marritta hesitated ere she replied, "This evening."</p> 
                  <p>"Who permitted you to enter the town?" asked Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>"One of your men."</p> 
                  <p>"His name?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know it, because I was not inquisitive enough to ask it."</p> 
                  <p>The general clapped his hands and a man entered the room. Marritta recognized in him the soldier who had opened the gate for her.</p> 
                  <p>"Is this the person whom you permitted to enter the town this evening?" asked Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>"It is," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Why did you not bring him here?"</p> 
                  <p>"I intended to do so but he escaped."</p> 
                  <p>"I was tired of waiting for him," said Marritta, "and as my news is important, the sooner you hear it the better."</p> 
                  <p>"What is it?" asked Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>"An army of thirty thousand Turks will be here to-morrow, and they will free their countrymen in the storming of this place. You alone can prevent them from coming."</p> 
                  <p>"How?" asked the general eagerly.</p> 
                  <p>"By destroying the bridge over which they intend to cross. Once destroyed they cannot get over; the current of the river is too strong for them to swim; and there are no boats."</p> 
                  <p>"And you advise me to destroy the bridge."</p> 
                  <p>"No, I advise you to saw through the timbers, and when the bridge is filled with men it will break down and thousands of the Turks will be destroyed.</p> 
                  <p>"A good plan," said the general, "and I will instantly send a party of men to execute it. Go, Starts, and tell Major Vane to prepare his men for marching instantly. Stay, I will write down the orders and then he will not be obliged to come here," and seizing a pen the general wrote rapidly for several minutes. "It is done; take it, Strats, and now off with you. Delay not on the way. Tell Major Vane that honor and promotion are in store for him if he succeeds in sawing away the timbers of the bridge before daylight."</p> 
                  <p>"Little did General Gortschakoff think that he was forming a trap to destroy the Russians that were advancing to help him. Little did he think that in order to be near him sooner they would cross that bridge. No, no, he thought not of that. He only thought of defeating the Turkish army that was advancing to the aid of Gen Pacha.</p>

                  <p>"And now," said the general, warmly, "how can I reward you for the information you have brought me?"</p> 
                  <p>"By giving me a pass to leave the town any time I wish," replied Marritta.</p> 
                  <p>"Take it," said the general, throwing her a small piece of paper. "Is there any thing else I can do for you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," replied Marritta. "A young man by the name of Handermoff was taken prisoner to-night. As I have a particular spite against this young man I would feel very thankful were you to make him over to me."</p> 
                  <p>"What would you do to him?" asked the general.</p> 
                  <p>Marritta drew her fingers across her throat.</p> 
                  <p>"You shall have him," said the general as he rang the bell. The door opened and a servant appeared.</p> 
                  <p>"Bring hither the prisoner, Charles Handermoff," said Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes several men entered leading the prisoner.</p> 
                  <p>"Charles Handermoff," said the general, "I told you to prepare for death. It now depends upon that man whether you are to live or die."</p> 
                  <p>Handermoff slowly turned his head, and fixed his eye on Marritta. No cry of surprise escaped from him although he recognized her at once. After gazing at her for a moment he turned his eye upon Gortschakoff.</p> 
                  <p>"General Gortschakoff can do with <unclear>me as</unclear> he pleases," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Take him then," said the general, "<unclear>and</unclear> see that he does not escape from you. Had we not better bind his arms?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, let him remain as he is," said Marritta. "I am a match for him or any three like him," and taking the prisoner's arm she left the room.</p> 
                  <p>In an hour they were safe within the Turkish camp.</p> 
                  <p>"Is the general awake?" asked Marritta, of the sentinel that was passing to and fro in front of his tent.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said the sentinel. "He is under great alarm about you."</p> 
                  <p>"I will calm his fears at once," said Marritta, as she entered the tent. The general was seated at a table. As Marritta and her lover entered he raised his head.</p> 
                  <p>"What, returned!" cried he in a tone of joy. Little did I expect to see you again, at least so soon.</p> 
                  <p>"General Pacha," said Marritta, "a small party of Russians will pass our camp within an hour."</p> 
                  <p>"They shall be cut off," said Pacha.</p> 
                  <p>"General," said Handermoff, "an army of eighteen thousand men will leave Kavaul to-morrow to aid the inhabitants of Citale."</p> 
                  <p>"This is indeed important," said Pacha springing from his seat; "but how and where did you learn this?"</p> 
                  <p>"General Gortschakoff himself informed me," replied Handermoff.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps the information may be false," said Pacha.</p> 
                  <p>"No, it is not, of that I am certain."</p> 
                  <p>"Then, by heavens! we will attack the town this night," said Pacha, springing from his chair. "Go! sound the alarm drum and tell my men to prepare instantly for the attack. Let the guns be loaded and place them on the left side of the town. Let three of the divisions remain behind and advance to the aid of the others when needed. Set fire to the tents and camp boxes. We will give the Russians a fair chance and show their Emperor that the Turks can defeat his armies even with the advantage on his side. Sound, sound the war cry of the Orlems! We fight for our Sultan, for God and for our country. Away! and prepare the men for the attack."</p> 
                  <p>In five minutes the whole camp was in commotion. The tents were fired, and by their light the men prepared themselves for the attack. In obedience to the orders of Pacha the cannons were loaded and placed on the left side of the city. Men were stationed beside them with lighted matches and ordered not to fire until the signal was given. Alarmed by the confusion that prevailed in the Turkish camp the Russians arose and stationed themselves on all sides of the town. The Russian flag was hoisted over he general's house, and several rockets were sent up to warn the Turks that they were prepared to receive them. The Russians knew that if they were defeated no mercy would be shown them, and for that reason they prepare to sell their lives as dearly as possible. As General Gortschakoff passed the different lines, he was greeted with loud cheers. In order to keep up their spirits he acquainted them with the facts that that the bridge had been sawn through, and that an army from Kavaul was advancing to aid them.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"I have," said he, in reply to an observation from one of his officers, "I have filled several of the houses with barrels of powder and applied slow matches to them, so that if the Turks should make a breach and enter the town they will find a warmer reception than they expect to meet. I have also barricaded several houses, and should we be driven from the wall we can defend ourselves for several days. I have also placed barrels of provisions in them; and in fact I have done everything that is necessary for the benefit of ourselves.'</p> 
                  <p>"There is one thing you have forgotten," said the officer.</p> 
                  <p>"And what is that?" asked the general, hurriedly.</p> 
                  <p>"The stream, you know, it runs near the Turkish camp and passes through our town. It is the stream that supplies us with water, and were the Turks to cut it off we would die of thirst."</p> 
                  <p>"My God! yes," cried Gortschakoff. Give the men who are not employed at the wall orders to fill all the empty barrels and everything that will hold it."</p> 
                  <p>The officer sprang from his side, and calling several men to him he ordered them to accompany him to the stream. It was not long ere the cry was raised that the stream had ceased flowing.</p> 
                  <p>"We managed to fill about a dozen barrels, and that is all we have to supply at least thirty thousand men, without counting the women and children," said the officer.</p> 
                  <p>"Then let them go without it," said Gortschakoff. "Place a guard around the barrels, and give them orders to cut down every one--"</p> 
                  <p>His speech was interrupted by a loud report and a sudden jarring of the earth.</p> 
                  <p>"They fired too low that time," said the officer. "Next time no doubt they will aim higher, and then if they make a breach in the wall we shall have some warm work."</p> 
                  <p>"We must keep them from entering the town as long as possible," said Gortschakoff. "It will be best for us to place a cannon near the point at which they are firing, and when they make a rush through the breach, fire. Load the cannon with nails and stones."</p> 
                  <p>"There goes another report," said the officer. "Look out, general, there comes a ball," and the officer sprang into the air. The ball rolled swiftly beneath him and disappeared in a bank of earth.</p> 
                  <p>"A narrow escape," said he, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"Very," said the general, also smiling; "but there comes another," and the general sprang to one side. "Look, they have made a breach, follow me," and drawing his sword the general rushed forward.</p> 
                  <p>It was true. The Turks had made a breach and were now pouring through it in vast numbers. General Gortscakoff motioned to his men to get out of the way, and hardly had they done so when the cannon was fired. Most of the Turks who had forced their way through the breach were either killed or wounded. Some few, however, were unharmed. These, maddened to fury by the groans of their comrades, sprang upon the Russians and cut them down with their sabres. So desperate was their onset that the Russians were driven back several rods, and it was only at the voice of their general reminding them that no quarter would be shown them if they were defeated, that they returned. Although the number of the Turks was but small, they fought with a bravery unparalleled. But their numbers were too small to insure them the victory. None of them turned to flee. They died fighting bravely, and even when in the agonies of death they tried to use their sabres and bring down an enemy with them. At length, however, the last fell and the Russians gave utterance to a faint cry of victory, that sounded more like a funeral dirge over the dying bodies of their companions.</p> 
                  <p>From a slight eminence a mile distant from the town, General Pacha saw the defeat of the party that he had sent to force the breach. In spite of all his efforts to prevent it, a body of nearly one hundred men rushed to the aid of their comrades. As it may be expected, these were driven back to the outside of the wall. Again they rushed forward, and again they were driven back, the number of them decreasing with every attempt. With sorrow and mortification the general saw the few that were left again enter the breach and fall fighting gallantly to the last.</p> 
                  <p>"This slaughter must be stopped," said the general, as he gazed around him. "Who, among the officers there, will dare to lead a body to the breach?" he asked, as his eye fell on several officers.</p> 
                  <p>"I dare," cried Handermoff, stepping forward.</p> 
                  <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5727-00000018"/> 
                  <p>"Go then," said the general. "Take the first division with you; and look you, Charles, much as I love you, I would rather see you meet a soldier's fate than turn your back to the enemy."</p> 
                  <p>"If I fall, look for me among the foremost," said Handermoff, waving his sword. "Forward, men! for God, our country, and our Sultan!" and followed by at least two thousand men he rushed forward.</p> 
                  <p>With a heart mingling with fear and hope the general saw the men disappear into the breach. In a few minutes they reappeared, for they had been driven back. In vain did the general look for Handermoff. He saw him not. The Russians pursued the retreating party even to the outside of the breach. It was at this moment that a solitary figure, mounted on horseback, and carrying a small silken banner, sprang out from behind the general, and dashed rapidly along in the direction of the breach. With a loud cry of "forward" and "I carry the Sultan's crescent," the figure darted through the breach and disappeared. In an instant the Turks turned on their pursuers, and with headlong fury drove them back to the breach. Here the Russians strove to maintain their ground, but with the fury of a mountain torrent the Turks drove them through the breach. Here the contest was short but bloody. At length, unable to withstand their ground, the Russians retreated to the houses which the general had prepared for them, and with a loud shout of exultation the Turks announced that the breach had been carried.</p> 
                  <p>"Forward," cried the general, waving his sword. Unable to restrain their impatience, many of the Turks broke from the ranks and rushed to the breach. These were speedily followed by all the others. The general smiled as he saw their impatience, and made no attempt to restrain them. When he arrived at the breach his first inquiry was for Handermoff. To his surprise he learned that the Russians had taken him prisoner, and that he was in the house over which the Russian flag was waving. Several of the Turks had attempted to force open the door, and they had paid for it with their lives. His next inquiry was for Marritta. To his surprise he learned that the person who had led on the Turks to the attack was no other than Marritta, and that she was safe, having only received a slight wound in the arm. In the presence of all his officers and soldiers he thanked her for her bravery, and vowed that, come what would, he would rescue her lover, and that too within the hour. He then sent a white flag to the house with orders to summon those inside to surrender. The bearer of the flag was shot dead. This act roused the general to madness, and he ordered his men to attack the house. It was in vain, however, that the Turks attempted to force open the door. The Russians fired through the loop-holes which they had made, and killed many. The general ordered his men to bring one of the cannon and place it before the house. This was soon accomplished. The cannon was then loaded and fired. A hole was made large enough for a man to crawl through. Again the cannon was loaded and again fired. This time the door was completely torn from its hinges; and ere the smoke had cleared away many of the Turks were in the house. Bravely they fought their way to the second floor, but here they were forced to stop. In vain did they try to cut their way to the third floor-it was impossible. Rendered furious by their desperate resistance, the Turks set fire to the house. In five minutes a huge volume of smoke enveloped the house. Under cover of this the Turks rushed up the stairs; and the Russians seeing that it was in vain to contend further, threw down their arms and surrendered.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is the prisoner whom you took at the breach?" asked the general, of one of the Russians.</p> 
                  <p>"In that room," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>The Turks entered the room, and saw a man bound hand and foot lying on the floor. It was Handermoff. Speedily his bonds were cut and once more he was a free man. The fire had now made such headway that the Turks were forced to leave the house, and hardly had they walked a dozen yards when it caved in. The house next to it caught fire; and it was at this moment that one of the Russians informed the general that the house was filled with powder. This startling intelligence caused all to retire many rods from the house. Not many minutes passed before a fearful explosion was heard and the ground rocked to and fro like the waves of the ocean. A thick cloud of smoke covered the house, and when it cleared away nothing was to be seen but smoking ruins.</p> 
                  <p>After a desperate struggle of three hours the remaining houses were taken. General Pacha then drew his men together and prepared to give the Russians, who were approaching from Kavaul, a warm reception. A favorable <choice>

                     </choice> was taken near<pb n=""/> the bridge, and the Turks awaited their approach in anxious silence. It was not long ere the "look-outs" descried a large body of men rapidly approaching. In obedience to the orders of Pacha, the Turks concealed themselves in a thick wood near the bridge. About one half of the Russians had got over the bridge when it fell in. Hundreds were drowned, and those that were on the other side turned and fled. The Turks did not pursue them. Early the next morning they set out on their march to Kavaul.</p> 
                  <p>Two months have passed away since the storming of Citale.</p> 
                  <p>It was a bright afternoon in March that a large body of men entered the city of Constantinople. In their midst were two persons. Charles Handermoff and Marritta. As they passed through the gate into the city the people who were awaiting their approach gave three loud cheers. In her right hand, Marritta held the banner which two months before she had planted in the breach at Citale.</p> 
                  <p>They passed through several streets, the crowd increasing at every step, until they reached the Sultan's palace. Here, in front of the palace, were drawn up in a line all of the soldiers that were in Constantinople. As Handermoff and Marritta passed them they raised their hands to their caps, and gave three loud cheers for the heroine of Citale. Hardly had it ceased, when the window was thrown open and the Sultan came forth on the balcony. In one hand he held a small silken banner, in the other a roll of parchment.</p> 
                  <p>"Charles Handermoff," said the Sultan, in a loud clear tone, "by virtue of our office, we hereby appoint you Pashaw of Egypt. Here are the rolls and seals of your office. Marritta, take this banner. It was made by my favorite wife. Take it, and when you again go forth to battle remember the giver. So long as we have such brave souls to defend us we need not fear the world. Take the banner, Marritta, and when next we meet, let it be said that the empire of Russia is no more."</p> 
                  <p>"Sultan of Turkey," said Handermoff, "I cannot accept your gift. Let it be given to one more worthy than I. My country needs my aid, and so long as I have power to raise an arm, so long will I fight for her. Nicholas of Russia has sworn to keep up the war until his demands are satisfied, or until death takes him from hence. I too, have sworn an oath-an oath that is registered in heaven. So long as Nicholas of Russia sends his armies to attack us, so long have I sworn to fight against him. Brought up in the Mostar Balkan mountains, God has seen fit to give me the gift of inspiration. Already have I warned Nicholas that he will, if he keeps up the war, perish in a strange land. He despised my warning. Ere many months have passed he will regret that he took not the Prophet's advice. Sultan of Turkey, hear the words of inspiration. Our nation, now on the decline, will grow up to be a great and glorious one. Ere a century has passed people will point to us and say-'This is Turkey, one of the greatest nations on the earth.' Our country will give birth to painters, poets, heroes, authors. But ah! in the future I see something that almost makes me curse my gift of inspiration. Our religion will fade away. The crescent will be taken down and the cross raised in its stead. The Koran will be thrown into the flames, and the religion of Mahomet-where will it be? Gone, forever gone from the face of the earth," and Handermoff covered his face with his hands. At length he raised his head and again spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"Sultan of Turkey, be firm, be wise, be prudent. Let your motto be-'Justice to the poor as well as the rich.' Sultan, I have done. Perhaps we shall never meet again. Forget not the Prophet. Marritta, hast thou resolved to go with me or remain behind?"</p> 
                  <p>"To go with you," cried the young girl with enthusiasm. "Wherever you go, I go. Together we will fight! Together, if needs be, we will die."</p> 
                  <p>"Then come!" said the Prophet, and waving his hand to the Sultan, he turned his horse's head to the army. In five minutes they had left the city far behind them; and in a week they arrived at the army.</p> 
                  <p>Reader, think you that the prophecy will be fulfilled? We do.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <p>THE year eighteen hundred fifty-three will ever be a memorable one in the history of Europe. In that year, France, England, Turkey and Russia were involved in a war with each other-a war, the end of which is yet to come; and when that end does come it will witness the destruction of one or more of these powers. And which of these powers, reader, will be destroyed? France? No. England? No. Russia? No. Turkey? Yes.</p> 
                  <p>Mahomet in the Koran, which, by the way, is but a mere alteration from the christian Bible, says: "My religion will last a thousand years, but no longer." The reader, by glancing at the history of Turkey during the last fifty years, will observe that the religion, of which God is the head and Mahomet is the Prophet, is slowly fading away, and christianity is taking its place. The customs of the Turks, too, are changing. The cushions on which they used to sit cross-legged, have almost entirely disappeared. The turban has been replaced by the European cap. The Janizaries, the most formidable body of troops that Turkey ever produced; who made emperors and destroyed them; who had existed for more than four hundred years; who had remained stationary while all Europe was advancing in civilization; this formidable corps was destroyed by Mahmoud H. in three days, that is, between the 14th and 17th of June, year 1826.</p> 
                  <p>It was a warm day in November that the Sultan of Turkey was pacing to and fro in his palace at Constantinople. At a little distance from him, and standing with their arms folded over their breasts, and their eyes cast on the ground, were several black mutes, whose hideous black features afforded a strange contrast to the pale, delicate features of the Sultan. The latter was attired in a black silk coat lined with threads of gold, and trowsers of the same material. In the center of his breast was a crescent covered with jewels. The sabre which hung by his side contained but one jewel; this was a diamond of the largest size. As the Sultan passed and repassed the single ray of light which beamed in from the window this diamond sparkled with a brilliancy that dazzled the eye. But the value of the sabre lay not in the pearl. The Koh-i-noor diamond now worn by the Queen of Great Britain, were it offered in exchange for the blade of that sabre, would not be accepted. And yet, when looking at the blade, we see but little to admire. Examine it closely and you will see small, thin lines of gold. A single stroke of this sword, when wielded by a strong arm, will cut a bar of iron in two, and that, too, without injuring the edge, which is as sharp as a razor. Need we say that the blade of this sabre is of Damascene steel?</p> 
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5727-00000020"/> 
                  <p>The Sultan, as we have said before, was pacing to and fro across the room. Several times when his back was turned, the slaves raised their heads and looked inquiringly at each other. What was the cause of their master's impatience? Had some one of his officers displeased him, and was he now thinking of some fearful punishment? They shook their heads at each other; and each one looked at his cimeter to see that it was ready to execute his master's will. After pacing to and fro for several moments, the Sultan raised his head.</p> 
                  <p>"Mahoud," said he, to one of the mutes, "has Omer Pasha returned?"</p> 
                  <p>The mute made a low salaam as he shook his head in the negative.</p> 
                  <p>Again the Sultan resumed his walk, and again he paused. Fixing his eye on the floor, he remained for a few minutes in deep thought. Nothing was heard but the heavy breathing of the mutes. Suddenly the door opened, and a tall, handsome man apparently about fifty years of age, entered the room. He was dressed in the costume of an English general. Without a word he advanced to the Sultan, and folding his arms he stood motionless as a statue.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! Omer Pasha," said the Sultan, as he extended his hand, which the other shook warmly, and then raised it to his lips. "We have been eagerly watching for your arrival, for Allah knows that we have had enough to torment us since you was here last.</p> 
                  <p>"My lord," said the other, in a deep musical voice, "in expectation of war between this country and Russia, I have been engaged in repairing our fortifications; increasing the number of men therein; increasing the taxes; exacting contributions and a certain number of men from the mountaineers of the Mostar Balkan range, and which they very willingly gave; and lastly, though not the least, I have had several maps of the country prepared, and which I now offer for your inspection." And saying this, he drew a roll of paper from his bosom and handed them to the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment a female entered. Her features were concealed by a thick veil. She was attired in the costume of a Circassian slave. On her head she wore a small crown covered with jewels. In a girdle at her breast was a small dagger. Her form was beautifully rounded, and her movements graceful. On seeing Omer Pasha she started back.</p> 
                  <p>"Come in, Torinda," said the Sultan. "Omer, this is my favorite wife. Torinda, take the veil from your face. You know I have done away with the absurd custom of my ancestors."</p> 
                  <p>The young girl, for she was hardly sixteen, suffered the veil to fall to the floor, and her features were disclosed. They were of surpassing beauty. So surprised was the general at her dazzling beauty that he started back, and an exclamation of wonder burst from his lips. The Sultan heard it with pleasure.</p> 
                  <p>"Is she not beautiful?" he said, gazing on her with admiration. "I have many flowers in my harem, but Torinda surpasses them all, not only in beauty but in accomplishments. She can speak several languages-among them the English and French. Ought I not to thank Allah for giving me so beauteous a bride?"</p> 
                  <p>Pasha made no reply-he could not speak-he stood like one in a trance.</p> 
                  <p>"Torinda," said the Sultan, again smiling, "have you nothing to say to our general?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Torinda, as her eyes wandered over the noble person of Pasha. "I have worked a banner with my own hands. Will Omer accept it from the Sultan's favorite?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said the general, suddenly recovering his speech, and speaking with an enthusiasm he could not control, "yes, I will accept of it. The old saying of the Prophet, that <choice>
                        <sic>whenvever</sic>
                        <corr>whenever</corr>
                     </choice> a banner, made by the favorite wife of the Sultan, is carried in front of an army, that army will be victorious, shall be verified in this case; for what Turk is there that would turn his back on Torinda's banner?"</p> 
                  <p>"Mahoud," said the Sultan-the mute sprang forward-"bring hither the banner."</p> 
                  <p>The slave bowed and left the room.</p> 
                  <p>"Is thy slave permitted, to speak?" asked Torinda, with a smile, as though knowing that it was useless to ask the question.</p> 
                  <p>"Speak," said the Sultan. "Thou art not my slave. Thou art my wife."</p> 
                  <p>"Omer," said Torinda, "the Sultan has informed me that you are to command his armies in the war against the Russians. Will you write to me often and let me know how the war progresses: and also, whether the Turks fight as bravely as they did in the days of Saladin the Great?"</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"I will," said Pasha;" but fear not that the courage of the Turks has deserted them. No, no; although they have had years of peace the shadow of what they once were still hovers over them."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh!" said Torinda, with a burst of enthusiasm, "would that I were a man, that I might lead on the armies of the Sultan against the invaders of our country."</p> 
                  <p>The Sultan smiled. "Torinda," said he, "we have enough of brave hearts to defend us. Retire to the harem. I will join you there shortly. Allah knows that when the women talk of enlisting in the army that the men cannot fail."</p> 
                  <p>"One kiss, my lord," said Torinda; and as the Sultan gave it she turned to Pasha. "Remember your promise," she said, and then left the room.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens!" said Pasha, as the door closed behind her, "but she is worthy of being your favorite wife. Many a man would sell his soul to the evil one for one glance of those bright eyes."</p> 
                  <p>The door opened and Mahoud appeared. In his hand he bore a small silken banner with a crescent and the name of Omer Pasha worked in it. Around the edges were the words-"There is but one God, and Mahomet is his prophet."</p> 
                  <p>"Hand me the banner, Mahoud," said Pasha, as the mute was about to lay it at his feet. Taking it in his hand, he said, as he raised it high above his head, "When next you see this, my lord, it will have been dyed in the blood of our enemies."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment a loud shout caused them both to walk to the window. On looking out they saw that the street was crowded with men, and that they bore arms in their hands. For a moment the Sultan trembled with fear, for he thought that an insurrection had taken place, and that the people were about to storm the palace.</p> 
                  <p>"Look!" cried Pasha, as a smile of joy came over his features, "look, my lord, these men have come from their distant hills to offer you their aid in hurling back the invaders of our country. They are brave, and from their youth have been trained to arms. Were you to exact anything from them they would turn upon you and the consequences would be fearful. But without asking, they have left their homes, their wives and children, to join our forces. My lord, these men will do more than a dozen legions of our regular troops. Need I tell you that they are Circassians?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," said the Sultan, "I recognized them at once. Who could mistake their dress, their arms, and the daring that is stamped upon their features for any other than that daring race? We are proud to think that they are under our sway. Well may Nicholas of Russia tremble when he knows that they are to fight against him. But invite their chiefs to enter our palace, for we would converse with them."</p> 
                  <p>The general left the room, but in a few minutes he returned followed by several men. Their half savage, half picturesque dress-their tall and brawny figures-the huge rifles they bore in their hands-the terrible battle-axes that hung in their belts-all these showed that they were fit spirits to command the wild and almost uncontrollable men who acknowledged them for their leaders.</p> 
                  <p>"The Sultan, Abd-ul-Mejid," said Pasha. "These, your Majesty, are the chiefs of the Circassians."</p> 
                  <p>While the general was speaking, the chiefs gazed around the room in wonder; they had never seen so much magnificence before. When the general pronounced the name of their tribe they turned and fixed their gaze on the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>"So this is our ruler," said one of the chiefs in a hoarse voice. "Why there is not a man in our tribe but what has more strength than he seems to have."</p> 
                  <p>"Is there nothing that you can do to give them some idea of your strength?" said Pasha, in a low voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said the Sultan. "Mesrour"-and he clapped his hands. The door flew open and the slave entered.</p> 
                  <p>"Bring me a bar of iron," said the Sultan, in a low tone. The slave bowed and left the room. Not five minutes elapsed ere he returned bearing in his hand a small bar of iron weighing, probably, six pounds.</p> 
                  <p>"Lay it on the floor," said the Sultan. When this was done, he turned to the chiefs, who were watching him with surprise. "Who among you," he said, "can break that bar with his axe?"</p> 
                  <p>"I," exclaimed the chief who had spoken; and handing his gun to one of the others, he drew his battle-axe. Raising the weapon high above his head he brought it down to the floor with such force that the palace shook violently. Still, however, the bar remained uncut.</p> 
                  <p>"Look," said the Sultan, and drawing his sword, he waved it several times around<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5727-00000021"/> his head, and then bringing it with terrible force across the iron bar he cut it in two. As he did so, the chiefs uttered exclamations of astonishment.</p> 
                  <p>"What think you of that?" asked the Sultan, as he wiped the sweat from his brow.</p> 
                  <p>"The arm of our ruler is of steel," said the chief. "My battle-axe must be sharpened again-your sword needs a new blade."</p> 
                  <p>"No," said the Sultan, as he held up the edge; "It is uninjured. Examine it for yourselves," and he gave it to the chief.</p> 
                  <p>"Worthy art thou to rule us," said the chief. "Comrades, let us do that which we have never done before. Let us take the oath of allegiance to our sovereign," and he fell upon his knees. The others imitated his example. On seeing this, the Pasha could hardly restrain himself from uttering a cry of joy.</p> 
                  <p>The Sultan gave them the oath, and when they had repeated it after him, they arose. Mesrour was again summoned and ordered to bring fifty purses of gold from the treasury. When he returned, the Sultan divided the bags among the chiefs.</p> 
                  <p>"Call to-morrow," said the Sultan, as the chiefs turned to depart. "I will see that suitable horses are provided for you. Have you tents to sleep in?"</p> 
                  <p>"Tents!" said one, smiling, and pointing to the window, he replied-"See you the blue sky above us? See you the grass that grows in your garden? The one is our tent; the other our bed. When we go forth to battle against our enemies, we take nothing with us but our food and our arms. To you the ground may be damp, the night air cold; but to us who are used to it, it is nothing."</p> 
                  <p>"Glad am I that these men have joined us," said Pasha; "but more glad am I to think that they have taken the oath of allegiance to you. Rude and untamed as these warriors are, they never break their word to friend or foe. They have never been defeated, nor never will be so long as they remain in their wild state."</p> 
                  <p>"But how came they to join us at all?" asked the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, that is the mystery," replied the general. "Some one must have induced them to come here, but who that some one was I know not."</p> 
                  <p>"I will ask them to-morrow," said the Sultan; and then clapping his hands, he said, as Mesrour entered the room, "I shall visit my harem now. Tell Torinda that I await her pleasure, Mesrour."</p> 
                  <p>Mesrour left the room, and after a short consultation with the general, the Sultan left also. As he disappeared through the door, the Pasha threw himself into a chair and drew a small map from his pocket and attentively examined it.</p> 
                  <p>"Should the Russians cross the Danube at this point," he said, "I will conceal the mountaineers behind the trees, and let the remainder show themselves. The Russians will think that our army is small and that it will be an easy matter to defeat us. No doubt they will advance without order. I will then order my men to advance towards them, and while we are attacking them in the front the mountaineers will spring out from behind the trees and attack them. The Russians will be frightened at the great odds against them and they will either throw down their arms and submit, or else retreat across the Danube. In either case the slaughter will be immense. Every Russian destroyed is an enemy less, and I must turn a deaf ear to their cries for mercy. God help them if they fall alive into my hands."</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE HAREM-THE SULTAN AND HIS FAVORITE-THE HISTORY; AND THE OATH OF VENGEANCE.</head> 
                  <p>The favorite's room in the palace was magnificently furnished. The rarest flowers of the universe were scattered on all sides. Statues from the best sculptors of Italy-paintings rare and valuable were there. Books bound in splendid covers were lying upon the table. On all sides of the room were magnificent mirrors which made the room appear larger than it really was. The floor was covered with a very beautiful and thick carpet. The furniture was of the most gorgeous description. From the ceiling in the center of the room there hung a large chandelier shaped like a tree; in the branches were placed many wax candles of different colors. Harps, guitars, music books, etc., were lying about the room. No room in the palace was so magnificently furnished as this, and well did it deserve the name of the "favorite's room."</p> 
                  <p>It was the hour of noon. Standing near one of the magnificent mirrors, and busily engaged in combing her hair, was Torinda. At a little distance from her were two female slaves, both very beautiful; but the beauty of Torinda far outshone theirs. They seemed like two planets by the side of the sun.</p> 
                  <p>"Khatoun," said Torinda, as she placed the small jeweled crown on her head, "inform my lord that I am prepared to receive him."</p> 
                  <p>The girl left the room. In a few minutes she returned followed by the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, Torinda," said the Sultan, as he seated himself on the sofa, "come and take your place beside me. Well do I love to retire from the throne and seat myself in this old, accustomed place. When you are near me, I forget the cares of the country, and think only of love. Leave the room, slaves, I would talk to your mistress alone."</p> 
                  <p>"And of what shall we talk?" asked Torinda. "Shall it be of war?" and her eyes flashed with an unusual brilliancy; "or shall it be of love?" and as she gave utterance to the word her voice became softer, and her eyes beamed with a strange melting light.</p> 
                  <p>"Let it be of love," said the Sultan, drawing his hand across his brow. "War! the name has rung in my ears for many months. Let us speak of anything but that."</p> 
                  <p>"Shall I sing of the daring deeds of Solomon the great?" asked Torinda, laying her hand upon the guitar.</p> 
                  <p>"Peace, peace," said the Sultan, with a smile. "Fain would I know something of your past history, Torinda. From the few hints that you have dropped out respecting your early life, you have awakened my curiosity."</p> 
                  <p>"Listen, my lord," said Torinda, and she thus began:</p> 
                  <p>"My history is a strange and eventful one. Born in the Caucasian Mountains, of rich and powerful parents, the fame of my beauty spread throughout your dominions, and many attempts were made to take me from my parents. Owing to my father's vigilance, these attempts were defeated. His influence over the chiefs of the country was very great. He was chosen arbiter in all their disputes; and in return for this the chiefs assisted him to 'put out of the way' all that dared to call themselves his enemies.</p> 
                  <p>"My education was well attended to, for my father knew that 'knowledge is power.' He was a very learned man, and could speak several languages with ease.<pb n="54 (Illustration) -55" xml:id="VAC5727-00000022"/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> The works of the most renowned authors were as well known to him as to the authors themselves. His memory was very retentive. He never forgot a friend nor forgave an enemy. I being his only child, was of course looked upon as his successor; and as his people were almost always at war, I was brought up to the use of arms. In my sixth year I could bring down the eagle from the crag-the wolf from his den. None could outstrip me in speed-and in the use of the sword none could equal me. Worthy was I to bear the name of Albia.</p> 
                  <p>"My mother was not only as beautiful as her daughter, but as well informed. She too was expert in the use of arms; and her influence over the people was nearly as great as my father's. Once, as he lay wounded in the castle a band of armed men made a descent upon it and took us prisoners. My mother was absent at the time. When she returned to the castle and heard that her lord and only child had been carried off by the enemy, she gave the call to arms, and sent the firebrand of war among the friendly chiefs. The chiefs aroused themselves at her call, and soon my native hills resounded with the cry of war. From afar the enemy beheld the preparations to attack them, and their limbs shook with terror. Like the mighty whirlwind my mother fell upon them, and like the falling of the leaves in autumn the enemy fell. Then resounded the cry of victory-then came the firing of the tents. We returned to the castle, and my mother smiled when she saw us in safety. My father smiled when he thought that it was her arm that had rescued him from captivity, and saved his only child from being a slave. Years passed on and I reached my twelfth year.</p> 
                  <p>"One day," and here Torinda's voice grew sad and sorrowful, "a chief of some distinction arrived at the castle. He brought with him his warriors, and they were many. He saw me and his heart became enamored of me. He swore that I should be his. We suspected no treachery. Late at night the castle was fired, and ere my parents could defend themselves they were slain. The chief entered my chamber and tore me from my bed. I saw his purpose, and drawing a dagger from beneath my pillow, I raised my arm for the purpose of self-destruction. The chief grasped my arm and wrested the dagger from me. He then bore me to the outside of the castle, which had just been fired, and ordered me to mount the horse which one of his men held. Knowing that it was in vain to resist, I obeyed. Many were the miles we traveled that night. At length we reached the river. Here we paused for the purpose of resting ourselves. While here my heart beat with hope-every moment I expected the arrival of my parents with a party-for I little suspected that they were no more. Time passed on, and they came not. Oh! how I wept that night. Allah knows that <emph>that</emph> night was the most bitter I ever passed. Daylight came and again we set off. Many, many hours we traveled-the burning sun shone down upon us, my throat was parched with thirst, my tongue clove to the roof of my mouth, and I was so fatigued that I could scarcely keep myself in the saddle. Yet I heeded not these, my whole thoughts were engrossed with my parents. Where were they? Had they failed to discover the road we had taken? No. What then? Little did I imagine that they were dead-that their bodies were consuming in the castle. Oh! Allah! look down upon me and help me to collect the thoughts which burn in my bosom like the simoom of the desert.</p> 
                  <p>"Three days passed when we reached the Black Sea. A ship was speedily engaged, and soon we were sailing over the dark waters. One night the chief entered the cabin and made insulting overtures to me. I replied with scorn. He grasped my arm and swore that I should be his. I resisted, and we struggled together. The events of the past week had so wrought upon my mind that I had lost a portion of my strength. Still, however, I managed to tear myself from him, and rushing to the cabin window I threw it open and swore by Allah that if he approached me but one step I would throw myself into the sea. The coward knew my determination; and he left the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>"Days passed on; weary days they were, for who could calm the tumult that raged like a stormy sea in the heart? Soon we approached the shore of Turkey. Glad were my feelings then, for I hoped soon to be separated from my persecutor.</p> 
                  <p>"One night as I lay upon my couch, the chief entered the cabin and locked the door. I knew his purpose and I sprang to the window; it was locked. On seeing this I folded my arms and gazed the chief sternly in the face. There was something in my eye-perhaps it was the cold, determined look of despair, that made him quail beneath my glance. Knowing, however, that I was a poor defenseless woman, without arms, with nothing to aid me, he bestowed on me a grim smile, and<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5727-00000023"/> again repeated his overtures. I made no reply, indeed I could not have done so had I wished. The ruffian then grasped me by the arm and drew me towards the bed. Despair lent me strength. I threw him from me; and seizing a large, heavy lamp that stood near, I grasped it in my hands and stood on the defensive. The chief gave utterance to an oath; and no doubt thinking that the death of my parents would terrify me, he briefly told me of their end. It was enough; in a moment despair and fear had vanished, and the demon of Vengeance had taken possession of my heart. With a calm smile-terrible from its very calmness-I walked to the door and leaned with my back against it. I then swore by Allah that I would wreak my vengeance on him; and that too, within the hour. The ruffian grew frightened; before, he had been the aggressor and I the coward; affairs were now changed. Oh! well did the ruffian know from the strange light that beamed from my eye that both of us would never leave that cabin alive; that one of us-perhaps both-would ere an hour passed be lying on the floor-dead. One would remain; but, who could that one be?</p> 
                  <p>"'Leave the door,' said he, drawing a pistol from his belt and aiming it at my head. I smiled as he did so, for at that moment I would have welcomed death instead of fearing it.</p> 
                  <p>"'Fire!' cried I, 'if you will and rid the world of your greatest enemy.'</p> 
                  <p>"'And throw away a fortune also!' said he, with a bitter sneer. 'No, no, Torinda, I have been offered an enormous sum for you, and I have had two much difficulty in earning it, to resign it so quietly.'</p> 
                  <p>"'Cursed <unclear>villain</unclear>!' said I, 'either you or I do not leave this cabin alive.'</p> 
                  <p>"'Leave the door,' said he, 'or by Allah! I swear that I will send a bullet through your body!</p> 
                  <p>"'Fire!' cried I, and he pulled the trigger. The bullet whistled past my head and lodged in the door. It was enough. Before he could draw another, I sprang upon him, and throwing him to the floor I drew his knife from his belt. He saw the act and strove to rise to his feet; but I held him down, for I had the strength of twenty men then. In imagination I saw my parents falling beneath the bullets, the castle on fire, the bodies consuming in the flames. Oh! with what a fearful joy I saw his fruitless efforts to rise; with what joy did I hear his cries for mercy and help. I could not strike then, for it seemed to me that the spirit of my mother stood beside me and restrained my arm. Oh! how I gloated over his agony. God! that hour was the sweetest I ever tasted for it was the hour of vengeance-the hour of retribution! The ruffian had taken me from my native mountains-from the stream wherein I had bathed my infant feet! he had destroyed the fondest of fathers-the kindest of mothers! and I, I who had suffered all this, had him in my grasp-groveling at my feet-crying for help-for mercy-mercy! Had he shown any to my parents? No! Aye! I had him thus: a single blow and I could have sent him to the place where he belonged-to Hell! But I would not let him die then. No! I would gloat over his agony-his cries for help were music to my ear! laughed at his sufferings, and at his ineffectual efforts to rise. Had the wealth of the world-the crown of Turkey-been offered to me to leave him then, I would have refused it. Had one of those bright angels, of whom we read in the Koran, appeared before me then and offered me Heaven if I would spare him, and Hell-eternal misery-if I refused, I would have accepted the latter with joy. Aye! 'many have felt the power of woman's love, but few have felt her hate.'</p> 
                  <p>"Cut this story short, Torinda," said the Sultan, as he crossed his face with his hands.</p> 
                  <p>"I will, my lord," said Torinda, and after pausing a moment, she continued:-"When the villain's voice became so exhausted that he could scarcely speak, then it was that I gave the blow; but, my hand trembled so, that the blow was but a slight one, and instead of entering his heart as I had intended it should, it merely gave him a slight wound. Again he rallied his exhausted strength and again he attempted to rise. I laughed wildly, for I felt that my sense were leaving me, and that what I had to do must be done quick or not at all. Again I raised the knife; again came the faint cry for mercy; again the blow fell; but, this time it entered his heart. I saw the glared eyeballs rolling in their sockets. I saw the half spring into the air, and then the hand clutching at vacancy. I saw him fall back into the arms of death; and then with a loud cry of gratified vengeance, I fell back insensible.</p> 
                  <p>"When I awoke I found myself in darkness. That I was still on board the vessel<pb n=""/> was evident from the rolling of the waves. I stretched out my hand and touched the cold face of the corpse. Any one else, perhaps would have shuddered at the contact; I only smiled. As I rose to my feet, a huge wave struck the vessel, and I fell on the corpse; my cheek against his cheek, my lips touching his. Again I smiled and rose. This time I succeeded, and I stepped lightly towards the door of the cabin. I reached it and turned the handle: I could not open it. Then the thought struck me that the key to the door was in the Chief's pocket. I stepped lightly over the floor, and kneeling down beside the corpse, I felt in the pocket until I had found the key. In a few minutes the door was open, and I ascended to the deck. Then the thought struck me that on learning the chief's death, the men would either murder me or give me up to a more horrid fate. I descended to the cabin, and drawing out the pistols from the belt of the corpse I again ascended to the deck. The night was dark and stormy; no stars shone in the dark, lowering sky. Nothing could be seen but darkness-utter darkness. I heard the rolling of the huge waves as they broke about the sides of the vessel. I approached the bow of the vessel and looked over. My eyes soon became accustomed to the darkness; and, soon I could see the white waves first dashing furiously together as though warring with each other, and then sinking far down, farther than my eyes could reach. Sometimes too, the vessel would be carried far up towards the sky; and then suddenly darting downwards as though about to be swallowed up by the angry waters. I grew wild with the excitement, and laughed at the furious efforts of the waves to sink us. Had any one passed at that moment, he would have taken me for the genius of the storm, and that I could make it cease at my pleasure. But no one passed; the sailors were too much occupied with taking care of the vessel, to see or heed me; and my wild cries were drowned in the roaring of the wind and the dashing of the waves. Oh! it was a fearful night and well suited to the strong passions that raged in my breast.</p> 
                  <p>"Daylight at length appeared, and I descended to the cabin. The storm had increased in fury and the vessel was far out of sight of land. The first thing that met my view was the corpse; the eyes were wide open and staring at me with a fearful expression. I threw myself into a chair, and drawing out the pistols, I removed the charges, and taking down the powder horn and bullet flask, I reloaded them. Hardly had I done this when I heard the steps of several men descending the stairs. Hastily concealing the pistols, I awaited their approach with calmness and even with impatience. No thought of danger flashed over my mind, for I feared not death, and had I not the means of defending myself? The door opened and the captain of the vessel attended by three or four of his crew, entered the cabin. They did not see the corpse for it had rolled in one corner of the room.</p> 
                  <p>"'Where is your master?' asked the captain.</p> 
                  <p>"'My master!' I cried. 'Talk you of a master to a Circassian?'</p> 
                  <p>"'The chief, then. Where is he?'</p> 
                  <p>"'There!' I replied pointing to the corpse.</p> 
                  <p>"'Well,' said the captain, without evincing any great surprise, 'I told you how it would be after all. Glad am I that she has saved us the trouble of putting him out of the way. Throw the body to the sharks, men; and then clean up the stains upon the floor. 'Tis a pity that she didn't do the deed on deck!</p> 
                  <p>"'The deed is done and can't be helped,' said one of the sailors; and then taking hold of the body he, with the aid of another, hove it to the deck and flung it into the sea. The captain and the other sailors were about to ascend to the deck when I spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"'What do you intend to do with me?' I asked.</p> 
                  <p>"'What did the others intend to do with you?' asked the captain.</p> 
                  <p>"'Sell me as a slave,' I replied, my lips writhing with scorn.</p> 
                  <p>"'And that is what we intend to do with you,' said the captain.</p> 
                  <p>"'Hark ye!' said I, 'alone and unarmed I attacked the chief. This act shows you, if you knew it not before, that I am brave-that I fear nothing. Suppose I were to say that I will not be sold as a slave: what would you do then?'</p> 
                  <p>"'We would use force,' replied the captain: 'and if you resisted we would throw you to the sharks.'</p> 
                  <p>"'And lose the fortune which the chief strove so much for,' said I. But I will not resist on one condition.'</p> 
                  <p>"'And that is--'</p> 
                  <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5727-00000024"/> 
                  <p>"'That you sell me to the Sultan.'</p> 
                  <p>"And who else, think you, would pay the price we ask?' said the captain. 'I am glad to see that we are on so good terms already.'</p> 
                  <p>"'I am glad to hear it for your own sake,' said the captain: 'but I can't stand here talking all day. I must attend to the vessel,' and saying this he left me.</p> 
                  <p>"At noon I was awakened from a short sleep by hearing strange noises on deck. There was a heavy tramping, followed by a loud yell, and the reports of several pistols. Then there came a loud shout of 'Go to your duty and I will see that the money is divided equally between you.' Hardly was this spoken when the clashing of cutlasses was heard: a pistol shot, and a heavy fall on the deck. Then the confusion ceased. I resolved to ascend to the deck and ascertain what happened. Seeing my pistols were ready for use I ascended the stairs. On reaching the deck the first thing that attracted my attention was the body of a man, his face dreadfully cut and his hair matted with blood. So surprised was I at this strange spectacle that I started back. At this moment the captain approached me. One of his arms was in a sling; in the other he held a cutlass, the blade of which was covered with blood.</p> 
                  <p>"'What has happened?' I asked.</p> 
                  <p>"'Why some of the crew have been quarreling about the money which we expect to receive for you, and they have carried the quarrel so far as to slay each other. The fools! they ought to have known better.'</p> 
                  <p>"Good heavens? was my whole life to be passed in scenes of blood? Such was my first thought; it soon passed away, and the same <choice>
                        <sic>savgae</sic>
                        <corr>savage</corr>
                     </choice> joy that had filled my mind the night before. The storm, as I said before, had increased in fury. Again I took my station on the bow of the schooner and again I shouted in wild glee. Suddenly the mist cleared away for a moment and I saw that the force of the wind and waves was driving the vessel on shore. Still, by informing the captain of the fact he could save his ship. But I would not, and when the mist cleared away the second time I saw that we were within fifty feet of land. It was at that moment that the crew perceived the danger; they uttered a loud cry of agony, and hardly had it died away when the vessel struck: the waves dashed over her and several of the crew were carried off. Again she struck, another wail of agony flew upon the breeze to Heaven, to tell God that in a moment twenty souls would appear before him. The wail had not died away when I saw a tremendous wave approaching the vessel. The loud cry was cut short as the wave broke over us and in an instant the vessel was lying at the bottom of the sea; the crew were drowned, and I-I was on the top of a large wave which was rapidly bearing me towards the shore. As it neared the shore it increased in strength and in a moment I was thrown far up the sandy beach.</p> 
                  <p>"My first thought was to fall upon my knees and give thanks to Allah: my second, to rescue some of my cowards from a watery grave. In vain, however, I looked around, I could see nothing of them: and then I knew that I was the only one saved.</p> 
                  <milestone n="*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>"After much toil I succeeded in reaching the top of a high hill. One glance showed me that I was in Turkey. A few miles distant was a large city. I recognized it at once, for I had seen, while in my father's house, many pictures of the diadem of the East. Yes, I knew at once that it was Constantinople.</p> 
                  <p>"After a fatiguing walk I entered the city. I gazed about in wonder at the magnificence of the houses and wondered whether Heaven was equal in magnificence to this. Soon I began to grow hungry. Then the thought struck me that I had not so much as a single sequin about me. I once the possessor of millions was now penniless. Where was I to get my food? Beg! What, I the daughter of Albia, beg! Sooner would I plunge the dagger into my heart than stretch forth my hand and beg a sequin.</p> 
                  <p>"At length, however, my hunger became so great that I was forced to sink down on a stoop: soon I fell asleep. When I awoke I saw a large crowd standing around me. Some gazed at me with admiration, others with pity, and others with that look which every one, more especially a young and beautiful female, can tell the meaning of in a moment.</p> 
                  <p>"Among the lookers on was an old man with a snow white beard. His features were very fine and his face expressed benevolence. I was greatly struck with his appearance. But, oh! little did I know that appearances deceive. Behind him<pb n=""/> were two slaves who watched his every motion as a tiger watches the enemy who is about to carry off its young.</p> 
                  <p>"'Girl,' said the old man, 'why set you here?'</p> 
                  <p>"In a very few words I told him my history.</p> 
                  <p>"'Come, with me,' said he. "Tis a pity that so fair a face as thine should be exposed to the heat of the sun and the gaze of the multitude. Come with me.'</p> 
                  <p>"I obeyed. He led me through several streets; the crowd still following us. Soon we reached a large gloomy looking mansion. The old man gave several taps on the door and we entered. To my surprise I saw about twenty young ladies about the same age as myself lying on the floor. Most of them were very beautiful. I knew from their features that they were my countrywomen-that they were Circassians. Some of them were weeping.</p> 
                  <p>'Old man, said I,' starting back, 'who are you, and what is this place?'</p> 
                  <p>"'I am a slave dealer, and here are my slaves.'</p> 
                  <p>"'It was of no use I could not escape from slavery.</p> 
                  <p>"'Set down, Torinda,' said the old man: 'you are the fairest of the lot. You are worthy of being a Sultan's bride.'</p> 
                  <p>"'I will be no other,' said I, 'unless it be the bride of death.'</p> 
                  <p>"Days passed on, the most beautiful dresses were purchased, and I reigned queen of the slaves. None dare oppose me, for often had they heard of my doings in their own country. The old man made no insulting offers to me. He knew the value of his prize and he determined to keep it perfect.</p> 
                  <p>"One day the Sultan's vizier came to the house. He saw me and was struck speechless with astonishment at my extraordinary beauty. Do not accuse me of egotism, my lord, for you know that I am beautiful. He asked my price, it was enormous. I was afraid that he would refuse it, and in obedience to the orders of the old man, I sang my sweetest songs-I spoke in several languages-I performed feats with the pistol, the bow, the spear, the knife and the sabre. I showed him how to handle the rifle, and how to strike off the head of a slave at a single blow. I danced, I played on the harp and other musical instruments which the old man had purchased for me. Aye! the daughter of Albia was well worthy the name of her race. The vizier was astonished, and paid my price without a murmur. The rich dresses were taken from me and I was attired in others of less value: but I cared not for this for I knew that I was going to the palace. Soon we reached the palace and my present master saw me. He was enraptured with my charms-and-and-I am now seated by his side."</p> 
                  <p>"Sweet Torinda," said the Sultan, straining her to his bosom, "your story has charmed me: it has made me love you more than ever."</p> 
                  <p>"My lord," said Torinda, as she gazed with her beautiful eyes upon the Sultan, "your slave is unhappy."</p> 
                  <p>"Unhappy," cried the Sultan. "What has made you so? Has any of my slaves injured you? Has my grand vizier insulted you? Do you doubt my love? Speak, Torinda, and let me know what is the cause!"</p> 
                  <p>"My lord," said the slave, her eyes glistening as she spoke, "I wish to fight the battles of my country."</p> 
                  <p>"What, you!" cried the Sultan. "No, no, Torinda, we cannot, we shall not part. The pride of the harem must not leave the palace, for if she did her lord and master would die!"</p> 
                  <p>"No, no, not that!" cried Torinda, grasping his hand. "Much as I love a soldier's life-much as I wish to fight the battles of my country! I would sooner die than that you suffer any pain on my account.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear girl," said the Sultan, "I love you too much to part with you. Allah knows that it was you that planted the flower of love in my bosom."</p> 
                  <p>But we need not record all the conversation that passed between them. Let it suffice for us to say that when the Sultan arose to take his leave he found that he could not cross the door sill. Something held him back. What was it? It was the power-the enchantment of love. Oh! Cupid! what fools thou dost make of us poor mortals.</p>

                  <head type="sub">TORINDA.</head> 
                  <p>IN a small, but splendidly furnished apartment, stood Torinda. She was alone It was her bed chamber, and she was seated on a small cushion near the bed. Her eyes gleamed with a strange unnatural light-her thoughts seemed far away. Ever and anon she would rise from the cushion and walk rapidly to and fro. What was she thinking of? Of her sunny vale wherein she had passed her youthful days? Of the high mountain where, with her rifle, she had chased the wolf and the antelope? Of the dark rolling river-the white gushing spring? Of her father's castle-of her mother's kindness? No, no, her thoughts were not of these. She was thinking of war. In imagination she was leading on a party of warriors-in one hand she bore the banner of the Sultan-in the other a sabre. And now the two hostile parties meet; and then comes the crashing of the cannons; the loud shouts of the Turks mingled with the groans of the dying. Soon the smoke surrounds them, and she sees nothing but wild figures rushing on each other-then comes the clashing of the sabres, the shouts of the victorious, the piercing shriek of the fife, the rolling din of the drum. Then the two parties separate-one party pursuing the other. Then comes the cry of the victorious Turks-the war cry of the Ottomans. Then comes the cry for mercy. Is it given? No! Soon the defeated party is cut to pieces and the Turks return. At their head is Torinda. The flag in her hand is dyed with blood-her face, her hands, the sabre, her clothes, are all stained with blood. Her features wear a smile of victory and of glory. And-before she could think further, the door opened and Khatoun entered.</p> 
                  <p>"The Sultan will be with you shortly," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"Tell him that I shall be ready to receive him," said Torinda, a smile of love playing over her features.</p> 
                  <p>The slave left the room. Hardly had she done so when Torinda sprang from the cushion.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes!" said she, "I'll do it. Better to die a soldier's death or win a soldier's fame, than live a coward's life-known to but a few-unknown to the world. My religion-my adopted religion-teaches me that in case of a war the women must fight as well as the men. Yes, I will do it, come what will-come what may!"</p> 
                  <p>For a few minutes she remained in deep thought.</p> 
                  <p>"But," exclaimed she suddenly, "how am I to escape from the harem? I thought not of that before!" and she gazed around the room. Suddenly her eye fell on a suit of clothes which belonged to the Sultan. The cloth was very plain-they had been made for him by an English tailor and in the English style. The thought struck her that she might disguise herself in them and then it would be an easy matter to escape from the harem. She drew them on-they fitted her exactly. She then resumed her own dress. Her eye now fell on a sabre and a pair of richly mounted pistols. At one end of the room stood a coffer containing drafts and an enormous sum in gold. The coffer and its contents had been presented to her by the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>"Allah has favored me," she said; "have I not everything I want-money, clothes, arms? Surely I ought to thank Allah for his mercy," and she fell on her knees. Not five minutes passed before a knock was heard at the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Come in," said Torinda, and Khatoun entered.</p> 
                  <p>"My lord wishes to know whether you are ready to receive him."</p> 
                  <p>"Am I not his slave? Tell him that I am ready."</p> 
                  <p>When the girl left the room Torinda drew out a small phial and poured a few drops into a bottle of wine-she then replaced it.</p> 
                  <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5727-00000026"/> 
                  <p>"Five drops, and the person who drinks it will fall asleep-ten drops and he will be dead," muttered Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes the door opened and the Sultan entered. He was attired in a beautiful dressing gown; his feet were covered with a beautiful pair of slippers; on his head he wore a magnificently embroidered night cap. On entering the room he advanced towards Torinda with open arms.</p> 
                  <p>"To the bower of roses, of which you are the queen," he said, with a smile.</p> 
                  <p>"Will my lord take a glass of wine?" asked Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said the Sultan; "for who would refuse to accept a glass from my favorite wife?"</p> 
                  <p>Torinda poured out a small glass and handed it to the Sultan, who drank it without in silence.</p> 
                  <p>"Come Torinda," said the Sultan, holding out his hands. Suddenly his eyes closed, his hands fell, and he sank back upon the couch.</p> 
                  <p>In five minutes Torinda was dressed in the Sultan's suit-the pistols concealed in her bosom, and the sabre by her side. She then proceeded to fill her pockets with bank notes and gold. When this was done she seated herself upon the couch beside the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! my lord, it is hard-very hard, to tear myself away from you, but I must, for my adopted country demands it. Perhaps I shall never see you again. Perhaps soon I may be lying upon the cold ground-dead. Oh, Allah! look down upon me and harden my heart. Tear from it the love which I have for the Sultan, at least for an hour. Thou knowest that I know not what fear is; but I <emph>do</emph> know the magic power of love. Little did the daughter of Albia think that her heart could love so warmly. I loved my parents with a daughter's love, but my love for the Sultan is deeper, stronger, wilder. Oh Abd-ul, were I to lose thee who could replace thee? None save my country's general, Omer Pasha. And yet my love for him is nothing compared to my love for thee. I love him because on him depends my country's hopes-on him and on my country's sons depend whether we are to live free or die slaves. Allah, look down upon my lord and let thy prophet Mahomet stand by his right hand and guide. Let his soldiers become victorious, and I will ask not for more," and she covered her face with her hands.</p> 
                  <p>Five minutes passed-five long minutes. Nothing was heard but her sobs, and soon they ceased. Rising once more, she kissed him on the forehead, and casting one more look of love on him, she left the room.</p> 
                  <p>On reaching the stairs she paused-what to do next she knew not, for she had not resolved upon any very definite plan. After pausing a few minutes she resolved to let things take their own course. Slowly she descended the stairs until she reached the second floor. Here again she paused. To reach the door that led out into the garden she would be obliged to pass through the sleeping apartment of the chief eunuch, and should he awaken, what reply could she make to his question? After hesitating a moment she laid her hand on the door and turned the knob. Slowly the door rolled back, revealing to her the apartment, which was brilliantly illuminated. The eunuch was lying on a sofa. Was he asleep or awake? The former, perhaps, for he did not move in the least. Drawing her sabre, Torinda closed the door and crept slowly along to the opposite side of the room. Keenly did she gaze on the face of the eunuch as she passed, and great was her joy when she discovered that he was really asleep. She reached the door without noise and opened it. Hardly was this done when a bell tinkled. At once Torinda discovered that a cord had been placed across the sill so as to cause the bell to tinkle whenever any one either left or entered the palace. She glanced into the room and saw that the eunuch was springing from the bed and rushing to the door with a drawn sabre in his hand. Knowing that if she attempted to escape him he would give the alarm, she placed her back against the wall, and grasping her sabre with a tighter grasp she prepared to sell her life dearly. Hardly was this done when the eunuch appeared.</p> 
                  <p>"Who are you-and what want you in the Sultan's harem?" cried the eunuch.</p> 
                  <p>"Look," said Torinda, as she moved her cap and suffered her magnificent curls to appear. "Now you know me, do you not?"</p> 
                  <p>"Torinda!" cried the eunuch, turning pale as death, for well he knew the consequence of suffering any one to pass through his chamber at night.</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, Torinda," said our heroine, "Suffer me to pass without molestation, for well you know that whether I escape or not your doom is sealed."</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"I know it," said the eunuch, sadly; "but I would rather fall beneath your sword than meet the Sultan's wrath. Strike!"</p> 
                  <p>"I will," said Torinda-and drawing back her arm she motioned to the eunuch to hold his head up straight. With a sad smile he obeyed. The sword descended quickly but surely upon his neck, and the head rolled from the body to the ground. After wiping the blade of her sabre, Torinda turned to depart. It was then that the thought struck her that she had no horse to ride to the camp.</p> 
                  <p>"I must have a horse at all hazards," she muttered; "But I forgot. I have plenty of money, and a horse can be purchased any time. And now to get over the wall."</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes Torinda stood safe on the other side of the wall. She knew that the army lay in a northern direction, yet how to reach it was a mystery that she could not fathom. She determined to inquire of the first passer by. At length she heard a heavy footstep approaching, and on looking up the street, she saw a man advancing towards her.</p> 
                  <p>"Friend," said she, stepping out, "how can I reach the army?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do not speak your language," said the man, in English.</p> 
                  <p>Torinda was as well acquainted with the English language as with her own.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish to reach the army," she said, in English.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! you are an Englishman?" said he, interrogatively.</p> 
                  <p>"No, I am a native of this country."</p> 
                  <p>"You speak our language well, at any rate," said the man. "The best way to reach the army is to sail as far as Burgas, and then ride on horseback the rest of the way. If I were in your place I would ride the whole way.</p> 
                  <p>"Why?" asked Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>Because a horse travels faster than a vessel sails. If you are poor, however, and wish to save money, I advise you to sail. I am the captain of as fleet a vessel as ever sailed the Black Sea, and have as gallant a crew under me as ever drew triggers or hoisted sail."</p> 
                  <p>"When do you sail?" asked Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"To-night," replied the other. "Even now my crew are waiting for me."</p> 
                  <p>"And will you suffer me to go with you,?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly, if you will," replied the other, as he caught sight of the magnificent emerald which Torinda wore on her right finger.</p> 
                  <p>"Let us go then," said Torinda. And they walked forward.</p> 
                  <p>"How long have you been a captain?" asked Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Count the fingers of your right hand, leaving out the thumb," said the other. "Yes; for four years have I sailed the Black Sea as a captain, and three years as a mate."</p> 
                  <p>"I presume that your vessel is a large one," said Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"No, quite the contrary," replied the other. "She rates at about two hundred tons. If the war continues I intend to change her for a larger vessel the first chance I get."</p> 
                  <p>"The war will continue so long as the Emperor of Russia continues to press his demands upon Turkey," said Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"I am glad to hear it," said the other. "A long war and plenty of prizes will make me happy."</p> 
                  <p>By this time they had reached the shore. The captain looked about him for a few minutes, and then picking up three large stones he threw them into the water one after the other. This appeared to be a signal, for a boat immediately put out from a small cove, and soon the bow grazed the beach.</p> 
                  <p>"Jump on," said the captain, and as Torinda obeyed he gave the boat a push with his foot and sprang in.</p> 
                  <p>"Row cherrily, men," said he. "From what I heard to-night, I am afraid that the hounds are in pursuit, and the sooner we reach the schooner the better."</p> 
                  <p>"Which is the schooner?" asked Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you see that vessel?" said the captain, pointing to a beautiful little schooner that lay nearly a mile from the shore. "That is the schooner which I have the honor to command."</p> 
                  <p>In a quarter of an hour they reached the schooner; a rope was thrown to them and the captain fastened it in a small iron ring in the bow of the boat. Then springing on the deck he offered Torinda his hand, and as her feet touched the deck he doffed his cap, and with a low bow, said:</p> 
                  <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5727-00000027"/> 
                  <p>"Hoist up the black flag, my men, and welcome, young man, on board the pirate vessel of which I have the honor to be captain!"</p> 
                  <p>On hearing these words, Torinda started back in astonishment, and then drawing her sabre she walked backwards to the mass and leaned against it.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you mean to harm me?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Harm you," replied the other, "and what have you done to me that I should raise my hand against you? No, no, young man, although I am a rover of the sea, and although I carry the scull and cross-bones at my mast-head, I would not harm you for the world. I promised you a safe passage to Burgas, and I intend, if nothing happens, to keep my word.</p> 
                  <p>Torinda stood for a moment as though irresolute.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps you mean to play me false," she said, at length.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you doubt my word?" said the rover, sternly.</p> 
                  <p>"I do!" cried Torinda, boldly.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens! young man!" cried the rover, "I'll force the words down your throat, and throw your body to the sharks. What! ho! there, my men, disarm him, and throw him into the sea. I saw a shark swimming beneath the bow of the schooner just now."</p> 
                  <p>With loud shouts the men sprang forward and attempted to obey the orders of their leader. Torinda extended her sabre towards them and for a moment kept them back.</p> 
                  <p>"Back!" she cried, in that calm voice which overawes all who hear it-the voice of despair. "He who seeks to cut me down will perish in the attempt."</p> 
                  <p>The men hesitated, and cast a glance at their leader.</p> 
                  <p>"What!" cried the latter, drawing his sword, "is it possible that one man can keep you in check? Stand out of the way knaves, and let me at him!"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop!" cried Torinda, as her eye fell on the pirate's sword and then again upon his features. Is it possible that Edward Wilks has forgotten his oath?"</p> 
                  <p>On hearing that name the pirate started back.</p> 
                  <p>"Who are you?" he cried, in a hollow voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Torinda! the daughter of Albia, your early friend," said Torinda, dropping the point of her sword to the deck. One of the men observed the action, and thinking that his leader would thank him for obeying his orders, sprang forward and raised his weapon. In an instant Torinda raised her sabre, and before the pirate could get out of the way or defend himself his arm was severed from his body.</p> 
                  <p>"Served him right!" cried the leader. "By heaven! if any dare to lift his arm against her, I'll blow his brains out!" and he drew a pistol from his belt.</p> 
                  <p>"The man was only obeying your orders," said one of the pirates.</p> 
                  <p>"What's that?" cried the captain, and cocking his pistol, he aimed it at the other and fired. To his surprise, the pirate remained unhurt.</p> 
                  <p>"Remember your oaths, men!" cried he, drawing his sword and springing towards the captain. With a grim smile the latter received him, and making a signal with his fingers, the other sailors sprang upon and disarmed him.</p> 
                  <p>"So you thought to throw me overboard and become captain, eh?" rover. "I knew it all from the beginning, even to the drawing the bullets out of my pistols. Then! what shall we do with him?"</p> 
                  <p>"Hang him!" cried the crew.</p> 
                  <p>"Two much trouble," said the captain. "A charge of powder will not be wasted by sending him out of the world."</p> 
                  <p>The men understood the <choice>
                        <sic>himt</sic>
                        <corr>hint</corr>
                     </choice>, and in a few minutes several reports and a splash in the sea told the captain that the mutineer was no more.</p> 
                  <p>"Thus perish all that dare to raise their hand against their captain," said the pirate; "but come, Torinda, let us descend to the cabin."</p> 
                  <p>In five minutes they were seated in the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>"How is it, Torinda, asked the captain, "that you recognise me?"</p> 
                  <p>"By your sword, Edward," replied Torinda. "I knew it at the first glance."</p> 
                  <p>"And well have I used the present," said the rover, with a bitter smile. "Oh! little did I think, Torinda to meet with you again-at least, under the present circumstances. Your boyish lover is now the dreaded rover of the black Sea: you-what are you?"</p> 
                  <p>"The Sultan's wife," said Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"But your father-what has become of him? Does he still live in the old castle?"</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"His ashes are there, but he is not."</p> 
                  <p>"What! is he dead?" cried the pirate. Torinda bowed her head in the affirmative.</p> 
                  <p>"And your mother, where is she?"</p> 
                  <p>"Dead," replied Torinda. "The same hand that slew my father slew him."</p> 
                  <p>The pirate wiped away a tear from his eye.</p> 
                  <p>"May the foul fiend wither the hand that slew them!" he cried.</p> 
                  <p>"I have avenged them," said Torinda, exultingly. "Aye, the murderer fell beneath my hand!" and she related to the rover what the reader has already read.</p> 
                  <p>"Torinda," said the pirate, "I, too, have borne and suffered much, but my history is too long to be told here. Rememberest thou, when in our youthful days we scaled the mountains and ventured where no human being had trod before? Rememberest thou when we slept together in the little cot beneath thy parents bed? Rememberest thou when we chased the wolf and the other wild animals of the forest? Rememberest thou when we practiced shooting, fencing, leaping, jumping, and other manly sports? Aye! and often didst thou beat me in them. Dost not the memory of the past bring thee bright visions of the future?"</p> 
                  <p>"It does," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Then what say you, Torinda, will you become the rover's bride? I have as galant a ship and crew as ever crossed the ocean wave. Worthy, worthy art thou to command them: aye, and thou shalt if thou wilt but accede to my proposition.</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot," said Torinda, "for I have a lover already."</p> 
                  <p>"Then throw him off!" said the captain. "Away with the sluggardness of a landman's life, for though thou art a woman, thou wast born to do great deeds. Thou wast born to win a name of glory-thou wast born to be a conqueror. Like Joan of Arc thou wast born to lead armies! Torinda, I offer you all-my ship, my crew, myself. Take them and win a name of fame!"</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot become a pirate's bride," said Torinda. "My destiny is otherwise. My country needs my aid and she shall have it. Where on this fair earth is there a brighter land? Where in this broad universe can braver sons and daughters be found? Look on our bright flag, the figure on it betrays at once our religion and our country! Aye! it is the crescent that leads our armies on to battle! It is the crescent under which they will gain their victories! It is the crescent under which they will die!"</p> 
                  <p>"But Turkey is not your country," said the rover.</p> 
                  <p>"It is my adopted country," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"A person cannot love his adopted country," said the other.</p> 
                  <p>"Why not? Does not a woman love her adopted child-a father his adopted son?"</p> 
                  <p>"True, true," said the other, "but will you accept my offer?</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot," replied Torinda;" my reason I stated before.</p> 
                  <p>"And who is he?" asked the pirate, with curiosity.</p> 
                  <p>"Abd-el," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"What he!" cried the pirate chief, his eyes flashing with scorn, "a poor, meddling, pitiful, drivelling fool! What he your husband! he who has a hundred wives already. Curses on him that he should win the heart of my early love!"</p> 
                  <p>"Peace!" cried Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"A fool who knows not how to manage his own affairs, but must hire others to manage them for him! A man-can I call him by that name-who passes his time in talking of love to his numerous wives. Why does he not imitate the example of Saladin the Great and lead his armies on to battle. Rather, Torinda, would I see you the wife of Nicholas of Russia than his!"</p> 
                  <p>"Dare say that again!" cried Torinda, "and I will forget that we are friends and hew you limb from limb!"</p> 
                  <p>The rover sank into a chair and drew his hand over his brow. Suddenly he started up.</p> 
                  <p>"Torinda," said he, "do not make me use force in this matter."</p> 
                  <p>"Force!" cried Torinda, "and will the pirate chief-my 'early love'-break his oaths?"</p> 
                  <p>The pirate arose and drawing his cutlass from the scabbard he threw it to the further corner of the room.</p> 
                  <p>"You will drive me mad!" he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Then leave me," said Torinda. "My temper is as quick as yours, my passions are as strong-but you have forgotten to give the order for sailing."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! and you are in danger of pursuit. What ho! up there on deck! Up with<pb n="66-67 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000028"/> the anchor and sails! crowd in all the canvass the schooner can carry. Keep the vessel in sight of land! Set her head in the direction of Burgas!"</p> 
                  <p>When he had given the orders he turned to Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Let us be friends," he said, extending his hand as he spoke. Torinda took it and shook it warmly. "To night," continued the captain, "It will tell you my history from the time I left you till now. It is a strange-a startling history which even you will acknowledge to be so when you hear it. It is of war-of captivity-of vengeance-of crime-of bloody and daring scenes. I will show you how I came to be a freebooter-how my hand came to be raised against every one and every man's hand against me; but I must attend to the vessel now," and saying this he left the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>"I must try and get him to join us," thought Torinda. "Yes, although a free-booter he would be a valuable acquisition to our side-but who is that speaking? As I live 'tis the voice of Mesrour-and-" before she could proceed farther, the door of the cabin opened and the captain entered.</p> 
                  <p>"Hide yourself-here, in this closet." he said, and touching a spring in the wall a secret door flew open. In an instant she sprang through and the door closed behind her; hardly had it done so when Mesrour the slave and Mahoud the mute followed by a party of soldiers entered the cabin.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE SULTAN AWAKENS FROM HIS DEEP SLEEP-THE SEARCH-THE DISCOVERY-THE SULTAN'S GRIEF-HIS STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE.</head> 
                  <p>It was several hours ere the Sultan awoke from the deep sleep in which the draught administered by Torinda had thrown him. His first sensation was a headache-his next a strange taste in his mouth. After lying still for a few moments, he stretched out his hand. Where was Torinda? In vain he placed his hand in her usual place-she was not there. So astonished was he for a moment that he remained motionless. At length, somewhat recovering from his astonishment, he sprang from the bed and called loudly on his guards. Mahoud, the mute, was the first to enter the room.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is Torinda?" asked the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>The mute shook his head in a manner which implied that he did not know, while his features exhibited the utmost surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"Is she in the garden?" asked the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>Again the slave shook his head.</p> 
                  <p>"Did she leave the harem?" asked the Sultan. The mute folded his arms. "You do not know?" asked the Sultan interrogatively. The mute shook his head.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the door opened and Mesrour entered the room.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is Torinda?" asked the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know, your Majesty," replied the slave, holding up his hands in astonishment.</p> 
                  <p>"Search the garden!" cried the Sultan-"wait!" he added; "I will go with you. Bring a lamp with you, Mesrour. Mahoud, you will go with us," and grasping his sword, the three men left the room.</p> 
                  <p>"She is not here," said the Sultan, after examining several of the rooms. "Let us go below," and they descended the stairs. On reaching the door of the eunuch's room, the Sultan flung it open. As we said before, the room was brilliantly lighted. One glance showed the Sultan that the room was empty. They then proceeded to<pb n=""/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5727-00000029"/> the garden. Here Mesrour discovered the body lying on a small plat, and the head a little distance off.</p> 
                  <p>"Who has done this?" cried the Sultan, his voice choking with rage and grief, for he prized the eunuch greatly.</p> 
                  <p>Mahoud looked up inquiringly.</p> 
                  <p>"What is it?" asked the Sultan, as he scanned his features attentively.</p> 
                  <p>Mahoud reached out his left hand as though he held a sabre in it, and then pointed to the one which the Sultan held in his hand.</p> 
                  <p>"My sabre," said the Sultan-"ah, you mean the companion to this one. What makes you think so?"</p> 
                  <p>Mahoud pointed to the body, and then made a rapid motion with his arm.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, you mean that the head was cut off at a single blow, and that no sabre in the country could have done it excepting the two belonging to me."</p> 
                  <p>Mahoud shook his head significantly in the affirmative.</p> 
                  <p>"You are right," said the Sultan; "The head was cut off at a single blow. But who has done it?"</p> 
                  <p>The mute laid his hand upon his heart as though embracing some one, and then closed his eyes.</p> 
                  <p>"Torinda?" asked the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>The mute bowed his head.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, it must have been her," said the Sultan, in a musing voice; "and yet I do not feel angry with her. But why-that is the question-why did she do it?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know, my lord, said Mesrour. "Perhaps she has returned to her own country. Perhaps the eunuch attempted to detain her and she slew him."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, that must be it," said the Sultan. "I am sorry-deeply sorry-that she is gone. Sooner would I have parted with half of my dominions than that she had left me thus. But Allah's will be done," and he bowed his head upon his breast.</p> 
                  <p>"My lord," said Mesrour, "if you will permit me, I will search the whole city until find her."</p> 
                  <p>On hearing this, the mute raised his head.</p> 
                  <p>"What is it, Mahoud?" asked the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>The black waved his hands slowly to and fro, and then made a hissing noise with his mouth.</p> 
                  <p>"I do not understand you." said the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>Mahoud made his hand move as though he were swimming.</p> 
                  <p>"He means for us to search the vessels in the harbor," said Mesrour.</p> 
                  <p>"Here," said the Sultan, drawing a ring from his finger, "take a party of men and search every vessel-every one, mind you-do not pass any without searching it-not even my own vessels. Show the signet to the captains, and should any resist, shoot them. Away!"</p> 
                  <p>When the Sultan was again seated in his chamber, he gave way to a flood of tears. This somewhat relieved him.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! Torinda, flower of my heart, pride of my harem-why didst thou leave me? Did Allah send thee from the sky to give me a few happy hours?-to make me taste the joys of paradise?-to show me what a houri is? Yes, it must be so; but oh! Torinda! if thy spirit is near me-if thou art now inhaling my breath-speak and whisper a few words of consolation in my ear. Tell me that thou art near me-that thy breath is fanning my cheek. A blast, deadly as that of the simoon of the desert, has passed over my heart-will it ever pass away? Allah only knows," and the Sultan again wept.</p> 
                  <p>It was many days ere the Sultan recovered from his loss. Recovered did we say? No, he never could recover from so great a loss as this. A deep melancholy settled over his features, and the once strong man was now wasted away to a shadow. In vain did the inmates of the harem try to distract his mind from his thoughts, which were constantly of Torinda; but days and weeks passed and she appeared not. One day the Sultan disappeared, and many weeks passed ere he was found. Search was made for him throughout the city, but he could not be found. Then the servants returned to the palace, and passed their days in anxious silence, dreading lest they should hear the news of his death-trembling lest he should return. Mesrour commanded that the strictest secrecy should be observed in regard to the Sultan's absence; and the inhabitants of the city little imagined that their Sultan was-where? No one knew.</p> 
                  <p>And now, reader, we must return to the vessel commanded by Wilks, the pirate.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE SEARCH-THE CAPTAIN'S STORY-A TALE OF BLOOD-THE PIRATE'S OATH OF VENGEANCE-HOW HE KEPT HIS OATH.</head> 
                  <p>At the conclusion of our third chapter we stated that the pirate chief touched a spring in the wall, and that a secret door flew open; that Torinda sprang through the door, and that it closed behind her; and hardly had it done so, when Mesrour, the slave, and Mahoud, the mute, followed by a party of soldiers, entered the cabin. The reader will thus see that all the following events take place on the same evening.</p> 
                  <p>"What is your pleasure?" said the pirate, as he stepped to the middle of the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>"We have come to search your vessel," replied Mesrour, casting a rapid glance around him.</p> 
                  <p>"Bear you the Sultan's order?" asked the captain.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," replied Mesrour.</p> 
                  <p>"For whom are you looking?" asked the rover.</p> 
                  <p>"For Torinda, the Sultan's slave," replied Mesrour. "Have we your permission to search the cabin, or must we do so by force?"</p> 
                  <p>"Am I not the Sultan's slave?-bear you not his signet? How, then can I resist the authority of the Commander of the Faithful. Search, and glad will it make my heart if you find her; although I know she is not here.</p> 
                  <p>Mesrour waved his hand, and the soldiers began the search. Old boxes and barrels were opened; things that had not seen daylight for many years were brought out, in short the cabin was turned, to use a homely expression, topsy-turvy. Still, however, the search was unavailing, and almost choked by the dust, Mesrour waved his hand as a sign to the soldiers to depart.</p> 
                  <p>"I am sorry that I have put you to so much trouble," said Mesrour.</p> 
                  <p>"And I am sorry that I cannot help you to find her," said the captain. "Give me a description of the girl. Was she pretty?"</p> 
                  <p>"See you yon moon?" said Mesrour; "can you find another like it? No. Imagine then, the beauty of the Sultan's favorite, when another like her cannot be found."</p> 
                  <p>"If I should happen to come across her," said the captain, "I will send you word and let you know. I presume that the Sultan will amply reward the person that finds her."</p> 
                  <p>"Even to the half of his possessions," said Mesrour.</p> 
                  <p>We must here inform the reader that Mesrour could speak English nearly as good as Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Phew!" whistled the captain, "I must try and get that reward." And as Mesrour ascended the stairs he muttered to himself, "I have tasted the bowstring once, and I would rather be devoured by a shark than get the cord around my neck again."</p> 
                  <p>While the search was going on, the schooner had been sailing slowly along at the rate of five knots an hour. When Mesrour and the soldiers got into the boat a sharp breeze sprung up, and filling the sails, caused the vessel to bound through the water like a bird upon the wing.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, Torinda," said the rover, as he opened the door. "all is safe. The fools searched for you a long time, but they gave it up at last. Ah! they ought to thank their Prophet that they found you not."</p> 
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5727-00000030"/> 
                  <p>"Why?" asked Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, sooner than permit any one to take a bird from under my wing I would blow up the vessel and all in it," replied the captain.</p> 
                  <p>"Then your last deed would be worthy of your life," said Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, it would," said the pirate; "but I promised you my history. Set you down beside me and listen.</p> 
                  <p>I am, as you know already, a native of England. Some love the land of their birth-I, the pirate chief, hate mine. Some look with joy over the history of their country-over the deeds of her sons. I have no such feeling. Often have I cursed the land of my birth, and with good reason, as you will learn hereafter. There is but one flag that I love, and that is the cross-bones and skull. I am wedded to a pirate's life, and who made me so? The poets of my-England. Oh! Torinda, rememberest thou those lines by Byron so descriptive of a rover's life? <q>

                  <p>And now to my story. My father, as you know already, was very wealthy. He traveled much, and merely for amusement. With him have I scaled the Alps of Switzerland, the Mountains of the Moon in Africa, the Andes of South America, the Rocky Mountains of North America, the Caucassian Mountains, the Ural Mountains, that divide Europe and Asia. I have crossed the Pyrennees of France, I have traveled among the green hills of Scotland, I have drank of the Geysers of Iceland. Aye, I have traveled far and suffered much, more than some beings that I know could bear.</p> 
                  <p>When we bade adieu to your family, we set sail for England. We had a very quick passage, and arrived there safe and sound. My father purchased a house in the neighborhood of Hyde Park, London. He had it fitted up in the best style, and there for some months we lived alone, contented and happy.</p> 
                  <p>A few doors from us resided a family by the name of Sycamore. They were said to be very rich, and of course, very respectable. A poor man in England, be he ever so well educated, is thought nothing of-a fool with plenty of money and little brains is courted and caressed. This family, no doubt, heard of my father-heard of his great wealth, and they resolved to win his acquaintance.</p> 
                  <p>One morning, as my father was reading a paper, the servant entered and handed him a note. It was an invitation from the Sycamores requesting him to attend a social party at their house, and to bring his son with him. My father wrote a suitable note in the affirmative. That evening we attended the party, and my father was introduced to Julia Sycamore, the eldest daughter. To cut the story short, I will say that he fell deeply in love-asked, and was accepted-and in three months he married her.</p> 
                  <p>Not many weeks passed before my step-mother began to treat me with unusual severity. I was too proud to complain of it to my father, and bore her ill-treatment<pb n=""/> in silence. Soon things began to be missed; and one day my father's watch disappeared. My mother suspected that I was the thief, and told my father as much. My father called me to him and bade me to confess the crime. I refused, because I was innocent. My father flogged me, and then sent me, supperless, to bed. As I passed by my step-mother, I saw a strange smile on her lips. Boy, though I was, I understood it at once. I rushed up the stairs and entered my bed chamber. In a few minutes my step-mother followed me. She closed the door, locked it, and then advanced to my bedside.</p> 
                  <p>"Edward," said she, in that low musical voice which Satan assumed when he tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, "what have you done with your father's watch?"</p> 
                  <p>I made no reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! Edward," said my mother, as she clasped her hands, while the crocodile tears rolled down her cheeks, "confess that you took it at once. Your father will then, I am sure, forgive you; and when your conscience is eased of the crime, your heart will be light once more.</p> 
                  <p>"Madam," said I, for I could not call her by the sainted name of mother, "I do not know where the watch is. Had you not better ask your brother where it is? Perhaps you took it yourself."</p> 
                  <p>On hearing this she uttered a loud scream and fainted. Instead of rising from the bed, I watched her in silence. Her face was turned towards me. Suddenly I saw her eyes open. When she caught mine fixed on hers, she closed them again. Thus we lay for several moments. By and bye the door opened and my father entered."</p> 
                  <p>"What is the matter, Julia?" he asked, in astonishment.</p> 
                  <p>My mother again burst into tears.</p> 
                  <p>"I came to request Edward to confess that he took the watch, and to ask your forgiveness for doing so."</p> 
                  <p>"Well?" said my father, seeing that she paused.</p> 
                  <p>"And he struck me."</p> 
                  <p>"By the great God above us!" cried I, springing from the bed, "she lies! For some purpose known only to herself and to God, she is seeking my ruin! Father, I am your only child, can you believe what that woman says?"</p> 
                  <p>"Woman!" cried my father, "call her mother!"</p> 
                  <p>"Sooner would I perish than call her by that name!" I cried. "Mother! she's no mother of mine. What have I done that she should try to ruin me?" and I stamped with my foot upon the floor.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! husband," said the woman, with another burst of crocodile tears, "do not whip him-he knows not what he says."</p> 
                  <p>"Boy," said my father, pointing to the floor, "kneel down and beg your mother's forgiveness."</p> 
                  <p>"Rather let her kneel!" was my reply. "Let her ask my forgiveness, and all will be well."</p> 
                  <p>It was enough. My father raised his hand and struck me a blow that laid me senseless and bleeding on the floor.</p> 
                  <p>Three months passed. I was an outcast and a wanderer upon the wide world. The woman had succeeded in her plans-she had made me homeless. Oh, God! it makes my brain crush beneath the weight of agony to think of it-but ah! I thank Him who made me that the hour of vengeance came!</p> 
                  <p>I joined a party of smugglers. At the age of nineteen, I became their leader. I was the most successful smuggler on the coast, and many attempts were made by the revenue cutters to capture me; but they failed. My many successful trips brought me enormous sums of money. The crew were delighted with their captain, and they implicitly obeyed my orders. Months passed on; I grew rich. One day, after making a very successful trip, I called my crew together, and told them to find another captain. The news was received with consternation. Nowhere, could they find so successful a leader as I had been. I silenced their murmurs with a large sum of money and by promising them that I would soon return. As I descended into the boat the poor fellows gave me three cheers. I could not reply, for I was weeping. Aye! the pirate, of the Black sea could weep then.</p> 
                  <p>I entered the stage coach and set out for London. When I arrived at the metropolis I went directly to my father's house. The blinds were closed, and there was a gloomy silence. I rang the bell, and soon the door opened and a servant appeared. I knew him at once for my father's favorite servant.</p> 
                  <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5727-00000031"/> 
                  <p>"Monts," said I. He uttered a cry of surprise. "Hush!" said I, "I am Edward Wilks. How is my father?"</p> 
                  <p>The old man wiped the tears from his eyes, as he replied in a solemn voice-</p> 
                  <p>"Dead!"</p> 
                  <p>On hearing that single word it appeared to me as though a hot iron passed through my heart. With a countenance blended with horror and astonishment, I repeated the word-</p> 
                  <p>"Dead!"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said the servant, "he died yesterday."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha!" said I, "then his body is in the house now?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, in the drawing room."</p> 
                  <p>"Can I see him without being seen myself?" I asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," replied the servant. "None of the family are at home excepting Mrs. Wilks, and she acts as though she was afraid to stay in the room alone."</p> 
                  <p>"Old man!" cried I, "think you that my father was-" I could not speak the word.</p> 
                  <p>"As I hope for eternal salvation," said the old man solemnly, "I do believe that he was poisoned."</p> 
                  <p>"Enough," said I, "take me to the drawing room."</p> 
                  <p>The coffin was standing on two stools. I approached it, and saw the pale, noble features of one I had so tenderly loved. Though cold in death, his eyes were open and fixed on me, as I thought, with a cold, glassy stare. His features were strangely distorted, as though he had died violently. The servant's suspicion came over me, and I knew at once that he had been poisoned. A slight noise in the room caused me to turn, and I beheld the object of my suspicions standing near me.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want here?" she asked, for she did not recognize me.</p> 
                  <p>"Look!" cried I, throwing off my cap, "do you know me now?" and I gazed at her with that look which Satan bestowed upon the Archangel Michael when he fell.</p> 
                  <p>"My God! it is Edward!" she said, as she fell fainting in a chair.</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, I am Edward Wilks! the son of the man you murdered! You triumphed over me once! it is my turn now!"</p> 
                  <p>The woman gazed on me with horror: her lips moved slightly, but she could not speak; the fearful heaving of that breast showed the agony that was working in her heart.</p> 
                  <p>"My hour of triumph has come!" said I; "but fear not, you shall not die by my hand. No! you shall die by the hand of the public executioner!"</p> 
                  <p>"No, not that! not that!" she cried, in a voice of agony.</p> 
                  <p>"My father's death demands it!" said I;-but why extend the tale. She was arrested and thrown into prison. In vain they-her friends-bribed the judge and the jury: she was found guilty, and sentenced to be executed. How I laughed with joy when I saw her trembling form borne back to prison. As she passed me she bent her face towards me for mercy:-mercy! I gave it! ha! ha! The same mercy that she showed to my father, I showed her! "The measure that we mete out to others, shall be measured unto us again."</p> 
                  <p>The night before the execution I visited her. She was lying on a couch. Her face once so redolent with the hue of health was now pale as death. Her features were haggard, and she was worn away to a skeleton. As I entered, she raised her head.</p> 
                  <p>"I have come," said I, with a smile that Satan would have envied. "I have come to bid you adieu. To-morrow you will be lying in the coffin which the undertakers are now making for you;" and I laughed with savage glee. Oh! none but those who have suffered as I have can tell the deep joy that reigned in my bosom then.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," I continued, "as I passed through the prison yard I saw the scaffold going up. I saw the trap door through which you are to fall; the rope with which you are to be hanged."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! spare me! spare me!" she cried.</p> 
                  <p>"Spare you!" said I; "oh! no, no. Think you that now the hour of vengeance is come that I will not enjoy it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Look on me," she cried. "See how I have suffered. The burning fires of agony and remorse-of hell-are burning in my heart."</p> 
                  <p>"The past is terrible," said I; "the future still more so. To-morrow comes the execution: after death comes the judgment."</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"Let me hear no more!" she cried. "What right have you to torment me thus?"</p> 
                  <p>"What right!" I repeated. "Who was it that poisoned the mind of my father against me? Who was it that turned me from the door; that ruined all the bright visions of my childhood days? Who was it that branded me with the name of thief? Who was it that poisoned my father? Who is it that will suffer to-morrow on the gallows? Who is it that will ere to-morrow night be in hell? Can you-dare you answer my questions?"</p> 
                  <p>The woman made no reply, but fell back on the bed: she had fainted. I called the jailer, and then left the cell.</p> 
                  <p>That evening I proceeded to the executioner's house: he was at home. I offered him a large sum of money if he would let me take his place the following day: he consented. I remained at his house all night. The next morning the sheriff came, and placing a mask over my face I set out for the prison, which I soon reached. As the executioner had given me directions how to proceed, I went immediately to the cell. The sheriff and some others belonging to the prison were there. I tied the arms of the prisoner behind her, and we set out for the scaffold. The chaplain of the prison walked on one side of her-I on the other. The chaplain, a tall, fine looking man, was whispering what he called "Sweet words of comfort," in her ear; but she heeded him not, for her thoughts were far away. Soon we reached the gallows. We lifted her up the steps-for she could not walk-and I placed the rope around her neck. The executioner had forgotten to inform me how the rope was tied, and I, of course, tied it the wrong way. The chaplain mumbled over a prayer or two, and I seized the axe to knock away the drop. At this moment my mask fell off-<emph>was it by accident?</emph>-and the woman saw my face. How I looked at that moment, no one can tell. I placed the mask over my face, and raising the axe I gave the drop a blow. In an instant she was struggling in the air. Generally, the struggle lasts two minutes; in this it lasted <emph>thirty</emph>. The crowd stood paralyzed with horror. Oh! it was a fearful sight to that dark, deep, moving mass, and that woman on whom their gaze was fixed, struggling on the gallows. The sheriff and his officers turned pale with fear. They had reason to be afraid, for that dark mass was slowly moving towards them.</p> 
                  <p>"For Heaven's sake end this," said the sheriff, while his whole frame shook with terror.</p> 
                  <p>"How-how?" I asked, wishing to prolong the struggle as long as possible.</p> 
                  <p>"Any way," cried the sheriff-"quick, quick!"</p> 
                  <p>Making one spring into the air, I caught her by the feet and hung on. The people below uttered a cry of horror and indignation; but they saw it was the only thing that could be done. In a few minutes the struggles ceased, and all was over.</p> 
                  <p>Months passed away. One day as I was passing near the Thames, I was seized by a press gang and hurried on board H. M. ship Duke of York. In a week we set sail for the Mediterranean Sea. While lying off the coast of Italy, I managed to make my escape. I then resolved to visit the castle wherein I had passed so many happy days. Accordingly I set sail for Turkey in a schooner. None of the crew were good sailors; many of them-for they always carry three or four dozen men to attack and rob other vessels whenever they get a chance-were drunk more than half the time. The captain found out that I was a sailor and that I understood navigation better than he did. He handed me his charts and ordered me to take command of the vessel. I obeyed. Soon we passed the straits of Messina. Hardly had the land disappeared from our view when we were chased by a pirate. I ordered the crew to arm themselves and be prepared for an attack. Instead of obeying me they fell on their knees and called on the holy Virgin to help them. This made me so angry that I kicked the captain overboard, and drawing my cutlass, I sprang among the sailors and drove them below. The pirate vessel was now within hail.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you surrendered?" cried a voice, that had something familiar in it, but for the life of me I could not recollect where I had heard it before.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," I replied. "Come on board and take possession;" and seizing the flag I pulled it down and threw it overboard.</p> 
                  <p>"All hands prepare for boarding!" cried the same voice, and as the pirate grazed the side of the schooner a dozen or more men sprang on board. One or them-the captain-sprang towards me with a drawn cutlass. Perceiving this movement, I drew my sword, resolving to sell my life dearly. Hardly had we crossed blades when we both exclaimed in the same voice "Edward Wilks." "Jonathan Williams."</p> 
                  <pb n="74-75 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000032"/> 
                  <p>"Jonathan Williams," said I, lowering my sword, and holding out my hand, which he shook warmly, "How came you here?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am the captain of the pirate vessel," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"But why did you leave the smuggling business?" I asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, all went wrong after you left us," he replied; "but, captain, what shall we do with this schooner?"</p> 
                  <p>"Blow her up-anything you wish," I replied.</p> 
                  <p>"And will you join us?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Under what office?" I asked.</p> 
                  <p>"As mate," he replied. "I was mate on board the Fire-fly-will you act as mate on board of my vessel?"</p> 
                  <p>I replied in the affirmative, and springing on board the vessel, I shook hands with some few of the crew with whom I was acquainted. The schooner was then set fire to, and we set sail in search of more prizes.</p> 
                  <p>Years passed on. One day in an engagement with a frigate our vessel was captured. Several of the crew, among them myself, managed to escape. Poor Williams was shot, and the remaining pirates set at liberty. They soon joined us. It was not long before we found another vessel, this one, and once more we were sailing over the sea. Again our vessel was captured, again I escaped. My name is a terror to all, from the sea of Azoff to Constantinople. Torinda, I have finished my tale."</p> 
                  <p>"Edward," said Torinda, "if you had a chance to win an honorable name would you not accept if as a boon from Heaven?"</p> 
                  <p>"Certainly," replied the rover; "but such a chance will never occur."</p> 
                  <p>"It will," replied Torinda, "the chance is before you now."</p> 
                  <p>"What mean you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Join the army," replied Torinda. "You have a large crew-no doubt they would be glad of such a chance to wipe away the stain upon their name. Were you to offer yourself to Omer Pasha I have no doubt but that he would gladly receive you."</p> 
                  <p>"As a common soldier, yes," said the captain; "but, Torinda, I was not born to obey, I was born to command."</p> 
                  <p>"I too, was born to command," said Torinda. "No doubt the general will give you a colonelship. He knows the daring of your men, and what a great acquisition they will make to his army. Believe me, you have only to offer your services and they will be accepted."</p> 
                  <p>"But my schooner?"</p> 
                  <p>"Do with her what you please," said Torinda. "If I were in your place I would destroy her."</p> 
                  <p>For a moment Wilks stood irresolute.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll ask my men," said he suddenly, and by heavens! if they consent to it, I will;" and he left the cabin.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes three loud cheers announced to Torinda that the proposal was accepted.</p> 
                  <p>"I have done something to aid our cause," she said. "How delighted the general will be when he finds that the pirates are to join him."</p>

                  <p>It was true. The pirates on hearing their captain's proposal accepted it at once. In five minutes the black flag-so long the terror of the Black Sea-was pulled down and thrown overboard, and the Turkish flag hoisted in its place.</p> 
                  <p>In six days the schooner reached Burgas. They remained here two days. On the morning of the second day a boat pushed off from the shore towards the schooner with a single man in it. On arriving near the schooner he hailed it and requested<pb n=""/>

                     <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5727-00000033"/> that a rope might be thrown to him, as he wished to come on board. In five minutes he was on board, and the crew crowded about him.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want?" asked one of the sailors.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish to see your captain," was the reply. "Where is he?"</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want of him?" asked the other.</p> 
                  <p>"What matters it to you, my man? I wish to see your captain. When I have seen him I'll tell you my reasons for visiting the schooner," and he ground his teeth as though not used to being contradicted.</p> 
                  <p>"You'll find him in the cabin below," said one of the crew.</p> 
                  <p>The man drew several gold pieces from his pocket and handed them to the man. The fellow started back in astonishment.</p> 
                  <p>"What is this for?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"For answering my question," replied the stranger. "Tell your captain that I wish to speak with him.</p> 
                  <p>"With pleasure," replied the other. "Come with me and I'll show you the cabin, sir" and he descended the steps followed by the stranger.</p> 
                  <p>Torinda and the pirate were at breakfast, when the door was thrown open and the sailor entered.</p> 
                  <p>"Captain Wilks," said he, "here is a stranger that wishes to see you on some very important business."</p> 
                  <p>On hearing this, Torinda raised her head. On seeing the stranger's features her face turned pale as death, and uttering a cry of alarm, she fell from the chair to the floor.</p> 
                  <p>"What is the matter?" cried the captain, springing from his seat and rushing towards her.</p> 
                  <p>"Take me in the other room-quick," she said, in a quick, hurried tone, yet so low was it that the stranger heard her not. The captain obeyed, for he saw that something unusual had happened. On reaching the other room, Torinda sprang from his arms and closed the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Edward," said she, in a voice that struggled with emotion, "know you who the stranger is that is now in the other room?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," replied Wilks, "neither do I care. If he is your enemy you need not fear him, for I will protect you."</p> 
                  <p>"He is not my enemy," said Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Who then?"</p> 
                  <p>"Bend your head-lower," said Torinda, and gazing fearfully around the room, she added, in a quick, startling tone-"it is the-the Sultan."</p> 
                  <p>"What!" cried the rover, in astonishment, "can this really be true?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-but silence," said Torinda. "Do not recognize him unless he reveals himself to you. Deal towards him as you would to any stranger. Think you that he would recognize me in this dress?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, I do not think he will," said Wilks; "but you had better change your sabre for another."</p> 
                  <p>"I will," said Torinda; and she did so. "You had better let me go out first, for he will think it strange if we both return together."</p> 
                  <p>Torinda opened the door and entered the other room. She Sultan was seated in a chair. On seeing Torinda, he arose.</p> 
                  <milestone n="*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>"I wish to secure a passage in your vessel as far as the mouth of the Danube," said the Sultan. "I am willing to pay a good price-twenty thousand sequins."</p> 
                  <p>"I presume that you carry despatches to the army," said Wilks.</p> 
                  <p>"You are right about the object of my journey," said the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes the sails were hoisted and they were sailing in a northern direction towards the mouth of the Danube. In ten days they reached it.</p> 
                  <p>Three days after they arrived at Oltenitza. It was with delight that Torinda beheld the place where she was destined to play so important a part. To the captain's great surprise, he learned that Omer Pasha was not with the army. He therefore wrote to the commanding general, telling him who he was and that he wished to join the army. The same day he received an answer which amply satisfied both his men and himself. That night the pirate's vessel was destroyed and the crew landed. The soldiers received them with joy. The Sultan's surprise was very great when he learned that he had been traveling with the renowned pirate. Little did he suspect that the captain knew who he was and that his heart's idol was so near him.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <p>It is night. No moon shines in the sky, and there is not a star to be seen. Nothing is heard excepting the heavy tread of the sentinels as they pace to and fro in front of the tents. They must be watchful, for near them is an enemy nearly three times their number. Suddenly one of the sentinels pricks up his ears; he hears a noise, a noise as of many men coming towards him. He looks carefully towards the river. He gazes but an instant-then comes the firing of a musket-then the alarm of "The Russians! the Russians!"-then comes the loud cries of men, the sudden blaze of torches-the call to arms-and the advancing party encounters another-then comes the report of cannons, the clashing of sabres, the loud shouts of the contending parties-another party from the Russian camp comes up to aid their friends-these are defeated-soon the whole army are there-and now the two armies are engaged together.</p> 
                  <p>The moment the alarm was given, Torinda sprang up and drew her sabre. The Sultan, who had not revealed his rank to any one, did the same. His example was followed by the pirate chief. In obedience to his orders, the men formed themselves into a large body and rushed from the tent. They were encountered by a small but determined party of Russians, who, without a word, sprung upon them. The conflict was long and well contested. Slowly, inch by inch, the Russians moved backwards towards their camp. Suddenly another party came up, and it was now the Turks' turn to retreat. Wilks, who had been attacking two or three of the Russians at some distance, now came up. In an instant he saw that the Turks were retreating and that a fierce and desperate charge alone could save them. Waving his sword he shouted, as he sprang into the middle of the contending parties, "Boarders, away!" In an instant every man felt that new life was infused into him. With a loud cry the Turks threw themselves upon the <choice>
                        <sic>Rusaians</sic>
                        <corr>Russians</corr>
                     </choice>, who, unable to withstand the impetuous charge, retreated. It was then that Torinda appeared. In one hand she carried a small banner, in her other a sabre dripping with blood. Placing herself at the head of the Turks, she charged upon the retreating enemy. The Russians turned to defend themselves, and gallantly did they maintain their reputation for courage. Numbers fell, but the others, undismayed by the sight of their fallen companions, fought on. They surrounded the Turks, and would soon have defeated them if another party had not arrived. Soon the Russians retreated to their encampment, and all, with the exception of the groans of the wounded, all was silent once more.</p> 
                  <p>At the hour of midnight, a man, dressed in a dark suit of clothes, left one of the tents and with a rapid but noiseless step left the encampment. The thick woods enabled him to reach the Russian camp unobserved. On reaching the central part of the encampment, he paused and looked around him. Not hearing any one, he advanced towards one of the tents over which the Russian flag was waving-a sentinel stood at the entrance leaning against one of the posts. Drawing his knife the man grasped him by the throat, and before he had time to speak, he plunged his knife into his body. Without a groan the sentinel fell a corpse upon the ground.</p> 
                  <p>After listening a moment, the man grasped the canvas and pulling it towards him peeped into the tent. No one was stirring. His quick eye caught the sight of three or four men lying upon the ground. They were sleeping soundly. Drawing his knife the man bent down on his knees and crept slowly towards the men. Soon he reached them. Raising his knife he drew it across the throat of the man that was nearest to him. He then listened attentively. Hearing no one, he crawled up to the next and drew his knife across his throat. The remaining two shared the same fate. With a quiet smile of satisfaction the man drew a large bag from his pocket, and cutting off the heads of the men whom he had slain, he rolled them into the bag. As he arose his eye fell on a small Russian flag with the name of the Emperor of Russia on it. He tore the flag from the staff and flung it into the bag. Then throwing his fearful load over his shoulder, he left the tent.</p> 
                  <p>In an hour he arrived at the Turkish encampment. Without speaking to any of the sentinels he went directly to the tent in which the Sultan slept. Wilks was the only one awake, and he was busily engaged in extracting a bullet which he had received in the arm.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is the Sultan?" he asked, as he gazed around the tent.</p> 
                  <p>"Gone," was the reply. "He left for Constantinople five minutes since. But where have you been?"</p> 
                  <p>"To the Russian camp," was the reply. "When the sun rises to-morrow the Russians will discover that their generals have been murdered."</p> 
                  <p>"And who done it?" asked Wilks.</p> 
                  <p>"I did," said Torinda-for it was indeed her-"I did. It was by my hand they fell. Their heads are in this bag."</p> 
                  <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5727-00000034"/> 
                  <p>"A daring, a noble deed," said Wilks.</p> 
                  <p>The next morning the battle was resumed. Seven times the Turks retreated and seven times did Torinda force them to return. The Russians were beaten-thousands were slain, and many were taken prisoners.</p> 
                  <p>Three months passed away. Torinda's daring deeds were on every tongue. The Sultan heard of them and requested Omer Pasha to let him-for no one, with the exception of Wilks and his crew, knew that she was a woman-visit Constantinople.</p> 
                  <p>"Young man," said Pasha, as he entered her tent, "the Sultan has sent for you. This makes the third time that he has sent for you. You must visit him. I have some important papers to send him, and you must be the bearer."</p> 
                  <p>Two weeks later. It was a pleasant morning in February, that a large body of men entered the city of Constantinople through the eastern gate. The streets were crowded with people, and all of the houses were decked with flags, banners, &amp;c. As the soldiers approached loud cheers rent the air. The object of all this attention was seated in the centre of the troops on a high throne drawn by two white oxen. It was Torinda. As they drew near the palace the gates were opened and they passed into the garden. The Sultan was seated on a high throne near the gate. Around him were all the foreign consuls and his officers in their robes of state. As the car approached the Sultan stepped from his throne and extended his hand. On seeing her features, however, he started back.</p> 
                  <p>"Young man," said he "I have seen you before, but where I know not."</p> 
                  <p>"It was on board the pirate vessel," said Torinda.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, so it was. I recollect you perfectly," said the Sultan.</p> 
                  <p>"My lord." said Torinda, struggling to restrain her emotion, "I bring you important despatches from the army," and drawing a large packet from her belt, she handed it to him.</p> 
                  <p>"Mesrour, take this," said the Sultan; "and now, young man, we are about to reward you. Whatever you wish for is yours. To day, you are the Sultan, and I am your slave. Name your wish; what is there belonging to me that you wish for?"</p> 
                  <p>"The <choice>
                        <sic>minature</sic>
                        <corr>miniature</corr>
                     </choice> which hangs around your neck is all I ask," said Torinda, her voice struggling with emotion.</p> 
                  <p>"That," cried the Sultan, starting back, "that contains the portrait of one most dear to me,"</p> 
                  <p>"And may I be so bold as to ask whose portrait it is?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said the Sultan, sinking back into a chair; "it is the portrait of-of Torinda."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the oxen started forward and Torinda's cap fell to the ground. Her curls, which she had merely placed in her cap, fell around her beautiful neck in luxurious profusion.</p> 
                  <p>"It is Torinda!" cried the Sultan, staggering back.</p> 
                  <p>"My lord," cried Torinda, and unable to restrain herself, she sprang upon the platform and clasped the Sultan in her arms.</p> 
                  <p>"Allah! I thank thee," cried the Sultan, as the tears of joy rolled down his cheeks.</p> 
                  <p>"My lord," said Torinda, timidly, "will you forgive me for leaving you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Forgive you!" cried the Sultan. "Yes, the joy of this meeting amply repays me for all that I have suffered."</p> 
                  <p>"Come," said Torinda, "I have much to tell you. Let us retire into the palace."</p> 
                  <p>That evening the city was brilliantly illuminated, and a solemn thanksgiving to Allah was made in the Mosque St. Sophia. All the inhabitants that could gain admittance in the mosque, attended, and great was their joy when they beheld the Sultan and his beauteous bride.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">DON MIGUEL.</head> 
                  <p>The calm twilight of a summer's evening shrouded the city of Madrid; the work of the day was over, and no sound was heard save the hum of voices and the occasional laugh of some gay cavalier enjoying the promenade in the soft air, puffing his cigaritto, and glancing at the fair forms on the balconies above his head. Among these idling gentlemen none were more remarked, and none received more approving glances from the bright eyes gazing down upon them, than two young men who sauntered languidly down the street, dressed in the richest style of the fashion of that period. They wore the gay velvet doublet, slashed with gold, with puffs of white satin along the sleeves, the brilliant embroidered waistcoat or jacket-fitting tight to the form-and the velvet breeches, reaching to the knee, terminating in a garter of velvet, embroidered curiously in gold. These rich and gorgeous costumes were completed by the broad, low-crowned beaver, the rim fastened up on the left side of the head, and a large plume drooping gracefully over the right shoulder. On their feet they wore white morocco boots, the wide tops of which reached half way up to the knee, disclosing silk stockings fitting neatly, which disappeared in the lace that hung over the top of the boot.</p> 
                  <p>The faces of these young men were entirely unlike, both in feature and expression. The one was of a dark and swarthy complexion, with bright black eyes, that revealed every sentiment, whether of joy or anger, that passed over his heart. His<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5727-00000036"/> long raven hair was carefully curled, and hung in ringlets beneath his hat, swept by the bright red plume that trembled and waved from side to side as the steps of its wearer passed over the uneven pavement. His nose was straight and finely formed; his mouth small, the upper lip concealed by a silky moustache as dark as the hair that clustered over his forehead and temples. When he smiled, which he did from time to time, he revealed between the half-parted lips, teeth white and regular, though large and compactly set. His frame was strongly knit, his arms large and muscular, and between the knee and the boot could be seen a finely formed leg, which gave evidence of its abundance of muscle at every step he took. He was above the medium size, and might have been called strikingly handsome but for the expression of his face, which denoted a sensual and cruel heart.</p> 
                  <p>His companion was the opposite style of person. His hair was much lighter than that of the one first described. His complexion was not of the same swarthy hue, and his face was full of gentleness and kindness. Its winning expression, aided by the glance of his soft blue eyes, had won for Don Miguel de Cazastro more favors from the beauties of Madrid, than all the manliness and stern beauty of his companion had secured for him, if the report spoke true that was echoed around among the gallants of that superb city. He wore no beard on any portion of his face except the slight moustache, which, though light and soft as silk, contributed not a little to his good looks. His dress was of the same fashion as the other's, only differing in colors-where the first wore red, the costume of the latter was blue.</p> 
                  <p>"Miguel," exclaimed the dark-haired cavalier, "the durance and the nature of our friendship both determine me to apply to thee for the assistance that I must procure for to-morrow morning."</p> 
                  <p>"And what calls thee, then, friend Pedro; is it another affair with some unreasonable brother or clamorous husband, who will not be quiet till he has assuaged the loss of his honor by the loss of a little blood, or is it an affair of play? Good faith, it cannot be a love affair, for they choose the night time, and shun the broad noonday, which, indeed, is sadly trying to the eyes!"</p> 
                  <p>"A truce to thy joking, Miguel, it is neither a <foreign xml:lang="SPA">duello</foreign> with a husband nor a brother, nor is it a love affair. In short, it is-"</p> 
                  <p>"It is-what?-for the Blessed Virgin's sake why keep me in this suspense!"</p> 
                  <p>"Thou wilt swear thyself to secresy?"</p> 
                  <p>"My hand on it!"</p> 
                  <p>"Agreed. It is, friend Miguel, neither more nor less than an abduction."</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"An abduction, Diavolo! and who is the fair subject of thy scheming?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is not a <emph>fair</emph> subject!" answered Don Pedro.</p> 
                  <p>"Ah!" continued Don Miguel, "she is old, then, and wrinkled, perhaps."</p> 
                  <p>"Neither old nor wrinkled," carelessly continued Don Pedro, wilfully provoking his companion's curiosity.</p> 
                  <p>"Who in the d-l's name is she, then?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is not a <emph>she,</emph> my dear Miguel-but look at those beautiful eyes gazing down upon us!"</p> 
                  <p>"The fiend take her eyes! "Wilt thou prolong my impatience still further? Who is it that my assistance is necessary to carry away, I tell thee? I am dying to know!"</p> 
                  <p>"What a face and what eyes, by Cupid! 'Tis like gazing into the sky reflected in the light of stars, for 'tis full as soft, and a thousand times as beautiful!"</p> 
                  <p>"May the fiend fly away with thy faces, and eyes, and stars, and thy love-sick nonsense! Wilt tell me who thou art to carry off?"</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, if thy curiosity is such that I can satisfy it by all that I know myself. To be speedy, then, it is a man."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, an old man with a sweet daughter, I suppose, and the daughter will pay the father's ransom!"</p> 
                  <p>"There thou'rt wrong, good Miguel, for 'tis a young man, with no daughter in the question; but his attentions to a certain donna Julia, that I wot of, are of too serious a character to be allowed to proceed any further."</p> 
                  <p>Don Miguel started, turned slightly pale, and inquired in a careless way-</p> 
                  <p>"And will he be alone, Pedro?"</p> 
                  <p>"By my faith, I hope so. Dost thou suppose, Sir Miguel Cazastro-thou a gallant and a knight-dost suppose a youth requires company in his ladies' bower? How should he be, if not alone?"</p> 
                  <p>"Then I will none of it!" returned the other. "If thou canst not settle thy affairs with a single man-thou a <emph>gallant</emph> and a <emph>knight</emph>-(emphasizing the words) breast to breast, and blade to blade, then I'll not play the part of the hired bravo, nor set upon a poor youth two to one!"</p> 
                  <p>"Hard terms thou makest use of, friend Miguel. Bravo is not an epithet for the ears of a noble of Spain."</p> 
                  <p>"I withdraw my words to no one."</p> 
                  <p>"And yet methinks were I to forget how long we had been friends, I could easily make thee."</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, with thy band at thy back"--</p> 
                  <pb n="84-85 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000037"/> 
                  <p>"My band!" echoed Don Pedro, starting from his companion's side, "what meanest thou, Miguel, by my band?"</p> 
                  <p>"Thy surprise is very well, and would do honor to a play-actor, but it dupes not me."</p> 
                  <p>"Hark ye, Sir Miguel, it is ill jesting on such subjects, and I pray thee dally no longer with my patience--"</p> 
                  <p>"It is my turn now, fair Sir Pedro," answered the light-hearted Miguel, laughing at his companion's impatience; "it is my turn now. Then thou shalt tell me the name of this young man thou proposest to carry away."</p> 
                  <p>"Faith, I know it not," answered Pedro; "all that I know is, that he has been seen to go there, and that he is of goodly mien; and that the fair Julia favors him is enough for me to know to hate him."</p> 
                  <p>"And now, my honest friend Pedro, I think, from various observations that I have made, that the chieftain called Bernado, the Bandit, and my friend Pedro, are one and the same person. Hist! no words, my gentle friend, and keep thy hand from thy sword-hilt. I have but to cry aloud to the citizens passing in this street, and they will not fail to earn the reward offered for thy head!"</p> 
                  <p>Don Miguel turned his eyes to the other side of the way, and when he again turned towards his companion he found that he had disappeared.</p> 
                  <p>"And now for the villa!" he muttered, as he turned down a street that led to one of the gates of the city, and was soon out of sight.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE SERENADE.</head> 
                  <p>In the midst of a richly cultivated garden stood a pavillion, built in the gothic style of architecture, surrounded by flowers and shrubs on every side, and shaded by the protecting branches of the large trees that waved over its gabled roof. The care with which everything was arranged, the neatness of the gravel walks, and the precise trimming of the hedges, all betokened the nature of the spot. In fact, it was fitted up as the boudoir of one of the most beautiful and haughty women of Madrid,<pb n=""/>

                     <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5727-00000038"/> where she passed her leisure hours. Often in the stillness of the summer evening a soft, sweet voice rose on the air, to the accompaniment of the tinkling guitar, dying away in the silence, waking the echoes of the little garden as it floated along o'er the heads of the listening flowers. Once, when the song was finished, and the fair singer had laid her guitar at her feet, a fine manly voice startled her from her reclining position, and she listened attentively to catch the words. The voice sounded near, and she judged that the singer must be concealed in the thicket behind her pavillion.</p> 
                  <p>The serenade was set to music of the most tender expression; the words might be translated as follows: <q>
                        <lg type="stanza"> 
                           <l>"Oh, heart! that no pleadings can move,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">I'd give up my hope of the skies</l> 
                           <l>For but one word from thy lips, love,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">Or but a glance from thine eyes!</l> 
                        </lg>
                        <lg type="stanza"> 
                           <l>Oh, would of the world I were king,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">Surrounded by beauty and pride,</l> 
                           <l>My all at thy feet I would fling,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">And pray-be my queen-be my bride!</l> 
                        </lg>
                        <lg type="stanza"> 
                           <l>Ah, soft is the light of thine eye,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">And maddening the touch of thy hand;</l> 
                           <l>Thy face is as fair as the sky,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">When summer shines over the land."</l> 
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p> 
                  <p>The singer had proceeded thus far in his serenade when he perceived with delight a small white hand protruding through the lattice window, which was open only wide enough to give egress to the taper fingers and small wrist of the fair Julia, for she was the beautiful goddess to whom this grove and pavillion were consecrated.</p> 
                  <p>The young man seized the hand and covered it with kisses, when it was withdrawn and the lattice closed over it. The young man was our acquaintance, Don Miguel de Cazastro, and this was the beginning of his passion for Julia. Every evening found him near the pavillion, and it was himself that had been discovered by the spies of Don Pedro, who had asked his aid in removing the unknown suitor from his path.</p> 
                  <p>Every evening, at the setting of the sun, the young and hand-some Don Miguel found himself near the pavillion, and at last his constancy was rewarded; the fair Julia, touched at his perseverance and patience, one evening sent out her maid to invite him to come in and partake of a cup of some refreshment after his ride, an offer which the young cavalier gladly availed himself of to become acquainted personally with his beloved. He entered the little pavillion, and was struck by the beauty of<pb n=""/> everything around him; the elegance and beauty of the various tables and pieces of furniture, the taste displayed in the selection of the pictures that adorned the walls, and by the loveliness and grace of the lady who seemed born to grace such a terrestrial paradise. Don Miguel partook of the fruit that was placed before him; never had he tasted such superb grapes as clustered on the vines of this lovely garden. He drank of the wine, and never had he quaffed such nectar before.</p> 
                  <p>It is easy, when we are in love, to make a feast of a very simple repast, provided it is shared with the object of our heart's affections, and thus with the youthful and ardent Don Miguel; he drank in the smile of his mistress with the ruby wine, and the one added to the effect of the other. Before he had spent an hour in her society the young man was madly in love. He hesitated not to avow his passion, and poured forth the burning avowal with all the earnestness of his impassioned soul.</p> 
                  <p>"And tell me, lady, I beseech thee," he concluded, "if in thy heart thou canst find one grain of hope for me; give me but the smallest foundation for hope and I leave thee not only satisfied, but delirious with joy. Speak, lady, speak, and decide my fate, for death is preferable to life without thee-the one is sudden and a sure remedy for my woes, and the other is a long and dreary road, leading to the tomb, it is true, but fraught with misery on the way. Lady, I would sooner die a thousand deaths rather than journey the dreary road of life without thee."</p> 
                  <p>And, dear reader, we must infer that he read in the tender eyes of his beloved those gentle hopes for which he prayed, and that he saw in the loving smiles that played on those rosy lips a language more eloquent than mere words, a language which spoke to him of love returned, a language that whispered to him in tones low, but thrilling as the throbbing of his own breast, welcoming him to the citadel of her heart.</p> 
                  <p>And that heart, that gentle, fluttering heart, was beating against his own, his arms enfolded her in a close embrace, and their lips met, in the first, long-lingering kiss of love.</p> 
                  <p>How shall we describe what so many older veterans of the pen have failed to do? How shall we describe the tender whisperings, the meeting hands, whose touches thrill to the soul; the low-murmured words that are breathed softly on the night air; the vows of constancy and ideal happiness floating through the dim vista of the future? Alas! how often do we find that those whisperings are not the breath of the true passion, but the promptings of the Evil one to the innocent and pure. Those low-murmured words, how often the language of deceit; those vows of constancy, how often made but to be ruthlessly broken; and those visions of ideal happiness, perhaps false as the heart<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5727-00000039"/> that prompts them, how often are they trampled upon sternly and pitilessly until the poor fluttering heart lies torn and bleeding in the icy coldness of the grave. No pitying hand will deck with the flowers of sympathy the marble above her head, and none will be found so careless of the <emph>world's</emph> opinion who will say an extenuating or a sympathizing word for the lost victim of man's perfidy and deceit.</p> 
                  <p>But in the case of Don Miguel and the lady Julia, sincerity and passion prompted the words that sprang from their lips, fresh from the limpid fountains of their pure hearts.</p> 
                  <p>We draw a veil over that lover's first meeting, for we feel that we never could do justice to the fervor of that interminable embrace at parting-that last kiss and that "Adieu!" breathed from two young beings on the soft night air.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE LADY JULIA.</head> 
                  <p>The lady Julia was seated on a softly cushioned divan, placed by the open window, the light breezes playing around her fair face, and tossing the auburn tresses, from time to time, over her white brow. Whether it was entirely for the sake of the evening breeze, that came laden with the perfumed breath of the flowers, which it kissed as it passed over their blooming heads, or whether she was watching the silver fountain leaping up, its snowy spray sparkling in the rays of the setting sun, or indeed what her real motive for choosing this situation was we cannot inform the reader, but we shrewdly suspect that it was not the fountain that attracted her gaze, nor the flowers that occupied her attention.</p> 
                  <p>She was looking up to the brow of the hill, behind which the golden sun was sinking in all his splendor; her eyes were fixed upon the winding road that led to the villa, and to the little village a few miles beyond. Expressions of disappointment flitted across her face, when a horseman appeared over the brow of the hill and passed quietly into the valley. The evening grew darker and darker, but still Julia kept her position by the window, and at last her patience seemed to be rewarded, for she started up from her reclining position, and exclaimed, her dark<pb n=""/> eyes lighting up with pleasure and a joyful smile playing around her mouth, "It is he! it is he! I knew he could not disappoint a heart so true to him as mine!" And looking up to the hill she saw a horseman galloping swiftly along, mid a cloud of dust which followed the hoofs of his horse. She saw the blue cloak and scarf, and the rose-colored plume that danced over his head. Nearer and nearer came the cavalier, until he was lost to her gaze in the windings of the road as it hid itself in the valley. But a few seconds elapsed and Julia was in vain trying to calm the beatings of her heart. Her quick ear caught the sound of a footstep on the floor, and in another moment she was clasped in her lover's arms. Don Miguel imprinted a kiss on her sweet, small mouth, and her non-resistance was the welcome she gave him.</p> 
                  <p>"My sweet love!" he exclaimed rapturously, as he seated himself on a cushion at her feet, "how fares it with thee?-art thou not dull?-dost thou not feel the want of a companion to thy loneliness?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am never lonely, dear Miguel," answered she, smiling, "when I have thine image before me, as it ever is; and how can I want any other companion but my own thoughts when they are continually whispering to me of thee?"</p> 
                  <p>The young man fondly pressed the hand which he held in his. After a moment of reflection he turned his eyes on the face of his beloved, and said, in a low, quiet tone-</p> 
                  <p>"My own dear Julia, it is sad to be bearer of bad news, but I feel that I ought to confide to thee what has come to my knowledge quite unexpectedly I assure thee. This very evening, as I was walking in the public street with a man I have known for a long time, an old schoolmate and companion of my earliest boyhood, he confessed to me his passion for-for whom think you, my dearest? Nay, you will never guess it, for it is none other than thine own sweet self!"</p> 
                  <p>"And yet, dear Miguel, I know not that I ever had speech with this friend of thine," murmured the lady, pausing in deep thought.</p> 
                  <p>"I am well aware, my sweet Julia, that there never has a word passed between you, and therefore that he ne'er has dared to press his insolent suit."</p> 
                  <p>"I know no suitor but thee, dear Miguel, and if Heaven will only vouchsafe thee to me, I will pray for no other."</p> 
                  <p>"My dearest and best," exclaimed the young man, kissing her hand as she spoke, "thy prattle is so sweet to me that in hearing thee speak I forget all else; I forget the world, all, and think of nothing but my own overwhelming happiness, and my most ardent love for thee. But I should warn thee, dear Julia,<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5727-00000040"/> against the machinations of this Don Pedro, for he has threatened to remove thy lover from his path, and a man who will carry away a fellow-being in the full blaze of noonday will not scruple to treat thee in the same manner; and once in his clutches, my dearest, I shudder to think what might befall thee!"</p> 
                  <p>"Fear nothing, my own," answered Julia, as she stole her arm soothingly around his neck, "thy Julia will ever be true to thee both body and soul. Seest thou this, Miguel, '<emph>Death before dishonor!</emph>'" and Miguel beheld in the left hand of his mistress a small, keen and exquisitely worked dagger or stiletto, which is so generally worn by Spaniards of both sexes. Don Miguel shuddered as the fearful thought crept over him, that flashing blade might once be buried in that soft and snowy bosom.</p> 
                  <p>No more beautiful group for the painter's hand was ever offered to the eye. The young and beautiful lady Julia leaned over from the sofa on which she sat, her right arm, round and white, was thrown around the neck of Don Miguel, who sat on the cushion at her feet. In her left hand she held the polished steel, and on it his gaze was riveted. Her large black eyes flashed with the excitement and the stern determination of her noble purpose, while his eyes gazed with an involuntary expression of horror at so deadly a weapon clasped in so beauteous a hand.</p> 
                  <p>"God grant, my beloved, that nothing may happen to thee that may render necessary even the <emph>thought</emph> of death, but I rejoice to see that thou art prepared--"</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, Miguel, I am prepared for a life of happiness and joy with thee, or I am prepared for death away from thee. I sometimes think, my own, that whate'er may be our fate in this world, that we will both meet again in the next, and when that meeting shall come who will ever separate us again? Let us hope, my own, let us hope!"</p> 
                  <p>"Julia, we are sad this evening; thou art not as gay as usual; and I, too, am sad. Sing to me, Julia, for thy voice is a cure for all my griefs."</p> 
                  <p>"But why should we be sad, Miguel, who could harm me, surrounded as I am by servants and dependents of the family? I have but to cry aloud, and one shriek will call to my aid a hundred men; and yet, as thou sayest, I am sad, but 'tis not a melancholy sadness, Miguel, since I can share it with thee."</p> 
                  <p>Julia took up the guitar which stood near, and running her taper fingers over the strings, her voice murmured rather than sang the following verses:<pb n=""/> 
                     <q>
                        <lg type="stanza"> 
                           <l>"The air is full of gladness,</l>

                           <l>Yet my soul is tinged with sadness,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">Altho' I know not why.</l> 
                        </lg>
                        <lg type="stanza"> 
                           <l>'Tis not of grief or sorrow,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">'Tis not of care or pain,</l> 
                           <l>For it whispers that the morrow</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">Will bring my love again!</l> 
                        </lg>
                        <lg type="stanza"> 
                           <l>Ever they at the evening hour,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">When the sun sets o'er the lea,</l> 
                           <l>Come, love, to thy lady's bower!</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">She ever waits for thee.</l> 
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p> 
                  <p>And here the manly voice of Don Miguel arose to the same air that his mistress had sung. <q>
                        <lg type="stanza"> 
                           <l>And when the day is over,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">And vanished on pinions fleet,</l> 
                           <l>Thou shalt welcome thine absent lover,</l> 
                           <l rend="ti-1">As he lovingly kneels at thy feet."</l> 
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p> 
                  <p>And thus in music and avowals of mutual affection the hours flew away, until Don Miguel reluctantly bid his last farewell to his beloved, and tearing himself away was soon flying on his way to Madrid. The sound of his horse's hoofs had scarcely died away in the distance when the figure of a man emerged from the thicket surrounding the pavilion, and crossing the garden was lost to sight. He pursued his way into the valley, and when he found himself under the shade of a large tree, isolated from the rest, he blew a blast on his horn that hung around his neck. Almost immediately a cavalier galloped up to the spot.</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, aye! Juan, I have seen him with mine own eyes, and have marked him. We shall see if this stripling shall cross the path of GUY ROMEZ with impunity! Follow on foot. I shall now hie me to the cave, Juan, where thou shalt find me. Adieu!"</p> 
                  <p>So saying he set spurs to his noble horse, regained the high road, and was soon on his way to the mountains.</p> 
                  <p>Meanwhile, as Don or <hi rend="i"/>Guy Romez, for he it was, was spurring to his mountain retreat, the lady Julia left the pavilion and regained the house at the other end of the garden. Soon the light, that gleamed like a star from her window, disappeared, and Julia was again with her absent lover in her rosy-colored dreams.</p>

                  <head type="sub">GUY ROMEZ.</head> 
                  <p>"Ha! ha! ha! my good Sebastian, what a boon companion art thou! By the holy rood! I have not laughed so heartily since the provost was going to hang me for theft. I quaff this goblet to thy health, and mayest thou live long to cheer us with thy ready wit."</p> 
                  <p>These words, interrupted by laughter from time to time, were uttered by a large and swarthy man, considerably past the prime of life, yet bearing great signs of vigor and strength. His face, nearly hidden in his huge black beard, was sinister and forbidding, though when he laughed as heartily as he was doing at the time of his introduction to the reader, the expression was not at all visible. His eyes were small, of a gray color, and set deep in their sockets, which, taken together with his large nose and wide mouth, displaying a huge set of wolfish looking teeth, and his abundant black beard, combined to render him not in the least a pleasing looking object.</p> 
                  <p>The company, consisting of from twenty to twenty-five persons, were seated round a large oaken table, on which were the remains of a plentiful supper. Flasks of wine, emptied of their contents, laid around the table, and others that yet appeared to retain some of the precious fluid were standing near the large cups and goblets of the men. They were men of all countries and climates mingled together, banded in the brotherhood of crime, to escape the penalties of the laws which they had outraged. The patricide, the murderer, the midnight burglar, the ferocious slave-dealer, together with thieves and other malefactors, here found a refuge, provided their courage and hardihood were well tried and proven. They took an oath on entering the band to observe the laws which bound them together, (for every community must have certain rules and regulations to guide them,) and to preserve implicit obedience to their commander, or leader, who was styled by his followers "GUY ROMEZ," to which was sometimes added "THE GUERILLA!"</p> 
                  <p>The apartment in which they were carousing was apparently hollowed out of the solid rock, but it was one of those caves<pb n=""/> which abound in the mountainous regions of Spain. It was lighted by torches, held by fixtures in the wall, which threw a lurid glare over the scarred and savage faces of the robbers, as they sat at their midnight feast, quaffing deep draughts of the intoxicating cup, and laughing aloud in their conscious security. Security, say we, for at every pause in the noise and confusion might be heard the measured tread of the sentinel marching silently to and fro on his post above their heads.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay! ay! my men, drink while we can and drive dull care away, for which of us knows what awaits him on the morrow? A song! good Sebastian, 'twill enliven us. Silence, down there, you roisters, silence for the song of Sebastian?"</p> 
                  <p>And while the ribald jest and the coarse song echoed loud under the vaulted roof, and the revelry and confusion was at its height, a mailed step was heard without, the rude door was flung open, and a young man stepped proudly into the apartment. At his presence every noise was hushed, every laugh was silent, and the song of the drunken Sebastian stuck in his throat. The man whose presence acted thus powerfully on those men so hardened by crime that no earthly presence could seem to affect them, was attired in a scarlet riding coat, bound in gold, a black plume bent proudly o'er his head, and the spurs on his heavy riding-boots clanked as he strode, erect and haughty, to the head of the table.</p> 
                  <p>A grim silence reigned supreme where but a moment since all was uproar and confusion. The intruder gazed around him with a piercing and scrutinizing look, a ray of fire seemed to flash from his eye when he encountered anything that displeased or any gaze that opposed. Beneath the fire of that flashing eye the stoutest heart quailed and the boldest gaze fell abashed. He gazed around him on the scene of debauchery and feasting, and a scornful smile curled his proud, determined lip.</p> 
                  <p>"Men!" he exclaimed, and the silence became, if possible, more oppressive than before, "I require ten of you, the boldest and most expert riders in my band, together with ten of the best steeds our stables can afford. See that they be properly equipped, and that there remains no girth to tighten or no impediment, for every foot shall be in the stirrup at sunrise. You have still two hours for sleep, and now away-and look you that my orders be attended to!"</p> 
                  <p>Without waiting any longer he ordered his lieutenant to pick the men, and attend to the execution of his orders, upon which he withdrew, and the heavy door closed once more behind him as his armed heel strode firmly through a long corridor in the rock which led to some other division of the cave.</p>

                  <p>Passing hastily along through a vaulted hall, lighted by torches fixed in the wall, Guy Romez entered a large circular apartment, which served for the guard-room. Here men were lounging, awaiting their turn to watch; some were sleeping soundly on the benches, others were playing with dice, and others were standing in groups, passing the time in gossiping and conversation. Guy passed on, unheeding all there save to acknowledge by a motion the salute addressed to him by his men, and passing through another corridor, he applied a key to a massive door at the extreme end, and swinging it on its creaking hinges, he entered, closed it carefully after him, and opening another smaller door, he stood in a small, exquisitely furnished room. A silver lamp was suspended from the ceiling; a thick carpet prevented his footsteps being heard. On an ample couch, o'ershadowed by curtains of damask and crimson silk, lay the form of a young and beautiful girl. Her beautifully moulded arm was thrown negligently over her head, as white as the pillow on which it rested. Soft brown eyelids threw a shade over the upper part of her face, and her parted lips showed her teeth regular and white, as the snow in the rays of the sun. A straight Grecian nose and a small dimpled chin completed the beauty of her features; thick tresses of curling auburn hair clustered around her temples and bathed the pillow which supported her head. Her well developed breast heaved gently in the unconscious slumber in which she lay. The bandit paused for a moment to gaze on this form, so light, so graceful, and glowing with youth and beauty. The blue veins were distinctly visible through the white polished skin that covered her symmetrical arms, and in those azure veins the life-stream of youth was leaping impetuously along, as you have seen some rivulet in the grim old woods, flowing rapidly over here a pebble, and there another impediment, but overcoming them all from the mere velocity of its course. The clouded brow of the chieftain relaxed its frown which had gathered there, and its stern severity faded away, leaving a smile in its place, as the sun, emerging from the black storm-cloud, brightens up with its heavenly light the face of nature, which was dark and scowling but a moment before. Guy Romez advanced softly to the<pb n=""/>

                  <p>"My Nina sleeps," said he in gentle tones, so unlike those in which he had addressed the band of revelers, that it sounded not like the same voice.</p> 
                  <p>"My Nina sleeps."</p> 
                  <p>"Nina sleeps," answered the girl, turning her large brown eyes full upon him, the red blood mantling in her cheek as she spoke. "Nina sleeps, for she is weary with watching for the return of her chief, and weary with sighing that he comes not. But her sighs are not heard by the absent one, and they cannot bring him back to her arms!"</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, nay, my gentle Nina, thy sighs have proved all-powerful, for behold me here at thy side. I come to tell thee, Nina, my beautiful, that our prospects are growing brighter, for this night I shall take two prisoners whose ransom will be a fortune in gold to us. Then, sweet heart, you and I will away from this mountain retreat, and with our wealth we will seek thine own fair land-the land of sunny France-and there, amid her blooming fields and vine-clad hills, we'll pass our lives away together and alone. Thou shalt have diamonds, and jewels, and satins, and lace, and all that thy heart can desire, and the queen in her palace shall not be as happy as thou!"</p> 
                  <p>The poor girl had raised herself on her arm during these bright words of the fair-spoken Guy, and the happiness of the future thus pictured to her imagination lit up her oval countenance with the glow of hope; her eyes flashed proudly, and she listened, with parted lips and head thrown back, to the enthusiastic promises of the crafty chief. In that one moment of credulity she forgot all the promises that had been made and broken, all the vows that had been trampled upon; all the past faded away from her sight, and she gazed on the bright picture of the future painted by the fairy-like pencil of Hope. She forgot the man, in the happy promises he made; she forgot his perjury, his desertion, and her own heartless betrayal. For the ruthless Guy Romez had taken advantage of her helpless condition to ruin her forever. Nina was but half a woman; beautiful as she was physically, yet she was but half-formed mentally. She was half-witted. Gentle and harmless, she wandered to and fro, and no one would dream of harming so helpless and so unfortunate a being. But the helplessness which even the savage Indian on the endless prairies of the West, and the untutored Turk, and the Arab on his native sands respect and protect, was no safeguard against the fiend-like designs of Guy Romez.</p> 
                  <p>The wild snatches of song echoed over the mountain tops, as<pb n=""/> the unfortunate young girl wandered beneath the shade of the lofty pines, gathering the wild flowers and wreathing them in her flowing hair, to welcome the return of the chieftain. But often he came not, and Nina was forced by very weariness to return to her couch, after nights of watching for him, <q>

                  <head type="sub">THE DEPARTURE OF THE ROBBERS.</head> 
                  <p>The gray light of the morning had scarcely tinged the rugged rocks with its leaden light, before Guy Romez, leading by the bridle a large and powerfully built black steed, which was to bear him amid the perils of the day, issued forth from an aperture in the rock, which closed up almost as soon as he had emerged in safety from its shade. He traversed the little pathway leading round the top of the rock, and soon stood in a circular meadow, around which the tops of the mountains rose on all sides, concealing the field from the view beyond. This had once evidently formed the basin of some little lake on the mountain, but the water had long ago dried up and disappeared, leaving about an acre of ground, in the form of an amphitheater, with a level gravel bottom, in some places showing signs of stunted shrubs and dwarfish grass. Into this arena walked the robber-chief, still leading his gallant steed; he was the first man on the ground; he sat down on a large round stone, and was soon lost in silent meditation. His horse began to nibble the few blades of grass that sprung up around the rock, from which pleasant occupation he suddenly desisted, for he threw up his head with a jerk that nearly tore the bridle from his pensive master's hand; his spread nostrils snuffing the wind, his listening ears erect, he stood as if awaiting some impending danger. Guy, however, scarcely noticed his horse's fear, for he stood silently awaiting the arrival of the cause of the noise and clattering in the distance. He had not long to wait, for with a wild cheer, a horseman dashed round the point of the rock, and galloped swiftly up to where the robber stood unmoved. The sight of a horse and rider bearing down at full speed upon a man<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5727-00000044"/> would, very probably, cause him to get out of the way, but the impassible Guy moved neither to the right nor to the left, and the rider continued his furious pace until within a few yards of where he stood, when he swerved gracefully and rapidly as an arrow that is turned from its course, and passing around, he at length stood still at the right hand of the robber chief, who bestowed on him a glance of approval. The rider who merited this encomium upon his horsemanship was a tall and slender youth, over whose head the dews of twenty summers had not yet fallen; his handsome face, and large, moist eyes, sparkling with the praise of his chief, his curling locks, all combined with his picturesque costume, rendered him strikingly beautiful to the eye of the beholder. He wore the common felt hat, or sombrero, of Spain, a velvet jacket, covered with buttons and ornaments, his vest of fancy colors disappearing in the wide, red sash, and his high horseman's boots, with his jingling spurs, proclaimed him a young guerilla, had not the brace of pistols in his belt, and the sword at his side, unmistakably attested the fact.</p> 
                  <p>He lifted his sombrero proudly in the air and saluted, with a perfect grace and ease, his chieftain, who still stood gazing at him.</p> 
                  <p>"Well done, Alfonso! thou art ever the first on the field when thy chieftain calls-and the others of my band, why tarry they behind?"</p> 
                  <p>"My lord," answered Alfonso, respectfully, "so please you, we are before the time; it lacks yet some minutes to the rising of the sun," and pointed with his hand to the crest of a neighboring mountain, behind which the approaching luminary was lighting up the eastern heaven with his soft and golden rays. Guy Romez looked in the direction indicated by his young lieutenant, for such was the youthful Alfonso, and gazed with admiration on the beautiful scene.</p> 
                  <p>"Alfonso, look at the rising sun! Mayhap 'tis the last sun that may rise on thy vision. I have prophetic forebodings of ill-fortune, which have clouded my waking senses and blotted sleep from out my earthly luxuries. This night I closed my eyes, I slept, 'twas but for a moment; methought I stood upon the rock o'erhanging that black abyss where men e'er this have found a tomb and none have been the wiser! Suddenly as I gazed into its fearful depths, I felt the moss on which I trod slipping gradually beneath my feet. The cold sweat stood out in huge, great drops upon my throbbing forehead, my brain reeled, I held my breath for very horror! Yet still I kept on in my slippery pace, I reached the brink; my ashy lips could not breathe the fleeting prayer that rushed to them for utterance;<pb n=""/> I reached the brink; I saw the dark, yawning chasm, and I felt myself precipitated, <emph>living, into my tomb!</emph> The frightful feeling of falling! falling! falling! awoke me to consciousness; and look ye, Alfonso, <emph>if there is a hell,</emph> I visited it in my dream this night!"</p> 
                  <p>The conversation of the two was interrupted by the same sound that Guy had heard alone. The two steeds pricked up their quick ears, snuffed the air, and as they did so, first the head of one horseman was visible over the point of rock around which he was coming, then another and another, and following in quick order, they galloped recklessly into the arena and formed into line before their leader.</p> 
                  <p>A gallant and a daring band they formed, and a wild, picturesque group they presented. Every variety of costume and dresses, according to the taste of the owner, from the small, shining steel cap to the peaked hat of the Italian bandit; from the cuirass of the dragoon to the gaily decorated jacket of the hussar. Every style and every material figured in that strange group. They silently dismounted to receive the orders of the chief, one or two were left to take charge of the horses, and the rest gathered around him in silence and alacrity. He detailed to them his plan, and as the sun rose on their glittering forms, his order of "To horse!" had been echoed back by the neighboring rocks and caves.</p>

                  <head type="sub">NINA'S EARLY LOVE.</head> 
                  <p>Nina stood on the mountain, gazing at the prospect spread out before her. She saw the wide and fertile plain stretching far away on each side, its grassy surface appearing like a field of rich green velvet, and the river that flowed peacefully through, on its way to the sea, reminded the poor girl of another river, not unlike it, in its winding course, far away in a land of hill and dale, more beautiful and fertile than this. There, on the hill-side, from the clustering vines, peeped out the blushing grape, there in that valley, far away, stood the little village, with the cot where she was born. Did the vines still bloom? did the grapes still cluster in the sun? did the village still remain? Such were the various questions she asked herself, for<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5727-00000045"/> she had no companion, no kind bosom friend, with whom she could interchange her thoughts. Once again, in fancy, the poor, lone girl stood in that oft-remembered valley, the evening song of the peasant struck familiarly on her ear, and from the distance, mingling with the whispering of the breeze, came the rippling music of the stream. The honeysuckle still clambered o'er the rustic thatch, and the flowers breathed fragrance on the air, while from the lattice window her mother's voice was heard, and the voices of the children filled the garden with their glee. Nina sat herself down on the moss beneath the pine tree, and her imperfect memory reflected her past life, as the troubled lake reflects the blue vault above.</p> 
                  <p>She was born and bred in the little village of Belle-rive. At the age of sixteen, Nina was almost a woman; her form was beautiful, and her reason then was perfect. Beneath the sunny skies of France love grows more rapidly than elsewhere, and indeed had the ancient mythologists not fixed the birthplace of Venus in some other land, we might suppose that it was in the bosom of some of the streams of France that the goddess of Love and Beauty rose refulgent from the wave. Nina, one cool evening in June, had wandered some distance from the little hamlet, lost in her thoughts and reflections. She was crossing a field to return home, when a low, threatening sound struck upon her ear, and turning in the direction from which the sound proceeded she saw a large and ferocious wolf, whose deep growl it was that had attracted her attention. These animals at that time infested the south of France, living in the woods, and sallying out by times in search of food when hunger drove them forth. Nina, terrified and bewildered, turned to fly, which the fierce animal perceiving, sprang after her, with a howl which curdled the blood in her veins. He was almost upon her, she could hear his panting breath close behind, she breathed a prayer and gave herself up for lost. But at that moment a form sprang from the thicket close by and intercepted the progress of the wolf. The furious animal turned upon the stranger, and a struggle ensued, which was short but decisive, for the knife of the young man had pierced his heart and breast in many places. So quickly was this done that Nina had not time to speak a word. The wolf once motionless, the intrepid young man drew the knife from its sheath in the animal's breast, stuck it to the hilt in the ground once or twice, to cleanse it, wiped it on the skin of the slain adversary, and quietly replaced it in its sheath at his waist. He then stood before Nina, revealing the strong, well-knit frame of a young man of twenty-one, with an honest and pleasing face and a form abounding in muscle.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, sir!" exclaimed Nina, at length, her cheek suffused<pb n=""/> with blushes, which only rendered her the prettier in the admiring eyes of the young man, "Oh, sir, how shall I ever thank you for your noble conduct? Without you I should have surely been torn to pieces by that furious animal, for hunger had rendered him over bold."</p> 
                  <p>"Mademoiselle," answered the youth, "I need no thanks, for the pleasure of doing <emph>you</emph> a favor more than compensates for the risk attending it. Mademoiselle, it is Providence that sent me to your deliverance this evening, for seeing you walking out, I involuntarily followed your footsteps. I have been here but for a few weeks, my father is the new blacksmith, and I am his son, Gaspar. It is useless for you to tell me your name, for since I have been here that name has formed the subject of all my thoughts and all my dreams. I have watched you often in the evening, and been nearer you than you could imagine at the time. Oh! Nina, I love you better than my own life, and all I ask is that you can love me a little in return. I should then be the happiest fellow in the village. Speak to me, then, Nina, may I hope?" And the blushing Nina bade him hope, and sealed her mandate with his kiss upon her pure forehead.</p> 
                  <p>For those two young hearts the hours were no more numbered, they flew away so rapidly, and Gaspar and Nina were affianced. The village priest had made all ready. Gladness and rejoicing filled the village; flowers were gathered, and wreaths were made, the feast was prepared, the wine stood in the bottles on the old mantel-piece, and Nina and Gaspar, the objects of all these preparations, walked around, perfectly unconscious of all these arrangements, for they were perfectly wrapped up in each other.</p> 
                  <p>E'er another sun had set, the one was destined to fall a sacrifice to the barbarous laws of his country, and the other was destined, in one day, to be a maiden, wife, and widow!</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE MAIDEN, WIFE, AND WIDOW.</head> 
                  <p>My dear reader, does my description of the humble life of the peasant weary your patience? Forgive my swerving from the direct course of my story, but I think that we sometimes love to escape from the noise and bustle, and gayety of the crowded<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5727-00000046"/> city, and steal a few days of quiet enjoyment in the country. One wearies of the constant rush and tumult of the town, and sighs for the quiet nook beneath those old trees where we played and sported in our infancy. And thus, I hope, dear reader, that you may find this chapter not totally uninteresting, as it describes what is happening every day in France.</p> 
                  <p>The wedding day had come, the little bride had donned her wedding dress; she wore no diamonds nor jewels of any description, but I will defy any one to find a prettier and more graceful bride. The jewels she wore were nature's freshest flowers, plucked that morning in the garden, the dew still sparkling on their heads. She wore no lace nor satins, but the simple snowy dress, fit emblem of purity and innocence, fitting tight to her lovely form, showed the perfect proportions of her heaving breast, her tapering waist, and buttoned loosely round her sculptured throat. Her little hands, not squeezed in little gloves, bore no rings nor jewels, and no satins nor velvets decked her form. But, reader, I have found that it is not always beneath satins, and velvets, and costly lace, that beat the truest and the fondest hearts, nor is it always the hand that is glittering in diamonds and in precious stones which you would do well to clasp at the altar.</p> 
                  <p>The day had come-the sun shone with its brightest rays, and nature bloomed and smiled beneath the unclouded sky, as if she had put on her best holiday attire to celebrate the happy scene. The village bell had scarcely ceased tolling, the first of the little procession had not issued from the small gothic church, after the ceremony which bound those two young hearts together for evermore, when, coming nearer and nearer, louder and <choice>
                        <sic>londer</sic>
                        <corr>louder</corr>
                     </choice>, came the sound of the beating drum! A grim terror, more awful, because so undefined, seized upon all present, and the new made wife clung to Gaspar's arm more tightly still. The wedding train passed from the church; they were met by a band of troops marching through the village, to recruit men for the war. They were ordered to halt; the men of the party were led out; the lots were cast; the first one fell to Gaspar; he was ordered to stand in the rank; with a heavy heart he obeyed, and tore himself from his wife's embrace. The rest shared the same fate-that is, those to whom the lots fell-and they were marched off to the tavern, to give rest to the troops, who were fatigued by their long march. Nina was led home by her sorrowful bridesmaids.</p> 
                  <p>About three hours afterwards Gaspar escaped from the guard that had the care of the recruits, to bid a last farewell to his weeping bride. It was evening, and he stole noiselessly to the house, but hearing voices in the garden, he pushed open the<pb n=""/> gate and strode in, and there he saw in the little arbor a scene that drove the blood leaping tumultuously to his heart and temples. Nina, his love, his life, his all, was struggling in the grasp of an herculean trooper, whose hand on her mouth prevented her screams from being heard. Passion and revenge fired his brain, and drawing the sword that now hung at his side, he rushed to the scene, and catching Nina from her assailant's arms, he grasped him by the throat, and shook him with his whole force, and only released him when he had become black in the face.</p> 
                  <p>"I had thought to kill thee, thou traitorous wretch, but as it is I'll but degrade thee. Here and here-and now begone!" Saying which he tore from each shoulder the epaulettes of his rank and flung them at his feet, trampling them in scorn into the dust; after which he actually kicked the would be ravisher out of the garden gate, and across the way, to the great delight of the villagers attracted by his cries. He then returned to his bride, whom he found fainting on the rustic seat. Her spotless dress was torn, profaned by lustful hands; her hair was disordered; her beautiful neck bruised in the struggle she had undergone. She opened her eyes at length to gaze upon her husband, and with a scream of joy she buried her head in his bosom.</p> 
                  <p>Their conference was interrupted by a file of soldiers, who came to the arbor and claimed him as their prisoner. They placed chains on his feet and wrists, and thus manacled he was led through the village, amid the sympathy of all.</p>

                  <p>The next morning, at day-break, the inhabitants were notified that Gaspar was to be shot! The fatal volley that deprived him of life deprived the wife of reason. He was shot for defending her from insult, but the sentence passed upon him by the court-martial was-"To be shot for striking a superior officer!"</p> 
                  <p>Nina was never more seen in her native village, she wandered away into Spain, where she fell a prey to the fiendish designs of the implacable Guy Romez.</p>

                  <p>Dear reader, the story which we have just related is not totally a fiction. Conscripts are drawn from their homes every day, and especially lately, since the bloody hand of War has stirred up the smouldering embers, and incited the grasping avarice for<pb n="104-105 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000047"/> territory of a crowned tyrant on a foreign throne. The fat merchant, as he looks in the newspapers for the prices of the markets and the state of the consols, little recks he for the misery and wretchedness produced by the war, provided he can fill his pockets with the proceeds of his speculations. Verily, the blood-thirsty NICHOLAS, on his throne, is not more of a tyrant than is the almighty dollar in this free republic of America!</p> 
                  <p>Dear reader, when you read of battles and struggles which are shortly to come to our ears, think of the lonely, anxious hearts waiting by the window, in the native village, waiting and watching for the courier who shall bring the news of the battle; how eagerly they peruse the list of killed and wounded, and how despairing is the shriek when the oft repeated name meets their eye.</p> 
                  <p>Battles are glorious and soul-stirring, but the huzzas and shouts of victory drown the groans and cries that are torn from the despairing hearts of mothers, and orphans, and sisters, and wives!</p> 
                  <p>Reader, the writer of these chapters once saw four thousand newly recruited troops marching through a village in France, in which he was residing for his health, on their way to Africa. Out of that band, he afterwards learnt, only <emph>seven hundred</emph> ever returned home! What the enemy had failed to conquer, the poisonous fever had laid low.</p> 
                  <milestone n="*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>We left Nina seated beneath the shade of one of the mountain pines, gazing down into the valley spread out before her. The next morning found her again in her accustomed place, and ere long her patience was rewarded, for she saw the file of men moving slowly along in the distance. But an hour had elapsed when they arrived at the cave. They bore in their midst a litter, out of which, to the surprise of Nina, there stepped a beautiful and elegant woman, much taller and much darker than herself. She watched this beautiful personage with the eye of a tigress, for she beheld how devoted and how respectful Guy appeared to be to her. She mechanically followed at a distance, as the captive Julia was being led along by the chief to the apartment devoted to her safe keeping. Don Miguel followed slowly between two guards; he had no sword at his side, nor other arms, for they had been removed by order of the robber-chief.</p> 
                  <p>Had Miguel's good sword been then hanging at his side it is probable that Julia would not have been long a prisoner. The two lovers, the evening before, had gone to attend a peasant's festival, held at a neighboring village. They had watched with pleasure the gayety and rejoicing of the honest villagers, and the darkness had already set in ere they started on their homeward<pb n=""/>

                     <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5727-00000048"/> way. They were obliged to pass through a little patch of woodland, where the branches and leaves were so thick overhead that a complete darkness wrapped its folds over and around them as they passed beneath. They had reached the middle of this little wood when Don Miguel felt himself suddenly seized from behind by two stalwart men, the bridle of his steed was held fast by another, and he was dragged from his saddle, without the power of moving hand or foot. The lady Julia felt the bridle of her horse pulled gently but firmly from her hand, and she saw the plumes of two men who were walking, one on each side.</p> 
                  <p>In this manner they reached the open ground, where the twilight showed them their captors. They consisted of a band of twelve, headed by a large and stern-looking chieftain, whom, when he turned around, Don Miguel immediately recognized as Don Pedro.</p> 
                  <p>Don Miguel appeared perfectly passive, but he was watching with eagle eye, the opportunity to escape.</p> 
                  <p>"Sir Miguel," said Guy Romez, approaching him, extending his hand, "It grieves me to meet you thus, and to be obliged to speak such words as those which are now on my lips. But, fair sir, duty is duty, and I have to warn you that if you give not your knightly word of honor not to attempt to escape from our hands, we shall be compelled to bind you hand and foot, and bring you with us by force. Choose, sir, and name to me your choice. Fair means or foul?"</p> 
                  <p>Don Miguel sternly and scornfully refused the proffered hand of the bandit, and seeing the utter hopelessness of escape at present, besides, not wishing to incur the degradation of being tied before the very eyes of his mistress, he gave his parole of honor not to attempt his escape, and to follow where his conductors might lead.</p> 
                  <p>When this conversation had been gone through with, Guy Romez mounted his horse, and taking the head of the escort, by the litter of the lady Julia, he gave the orders to march. The men sprang into their saddles with alacrity. Don Miguel's steed was restored to him, and the party traveling slowly all night, reached the cave early the next morning.</p>

The beauty and gorgeousness of her prison did not occupy her attention; she tried the door, she sounded the walls with her knuckles, she tried the fastenings of the little door on the side of the room, but all in vain. She was still ruminating on the hopelessness of escape when the side door opened noiselessly and slowly. Julia's heart beat high, she grasped the poignard in her bosom, but quickly replaced it on seeing who was the intruder. The visitor entered stealthily, seeming to glide rather than walk into the room. It was Nina. She was very pale; her long, fair hair fell over her marble shoulders; her tiny feet, thrust into embroidered slippers, were naked and white as snow. She seemed to have just risen from her couch and thrown on her dressing gown in great haste. For one moment the two women gazed upon each other in silence.</p> 
                  <p>The next Nina advanced towards Julia, and clasping her beautiful hands together, she exclaimed, with an imploring expression beaming from out her dark eyes, her quivering lip and pale cheek betokening the anxiety with which she awaited an answer, "Why comes the beautiful stranger to the mountain girl's home, to rob her of her only treasure? Why should they take from her everything that she loves? They murdered her husband-poor Gaspar-and now thou art come to take my chief from mine arms; he is all I have left me now to love. Oh, lady, go away to thy home and leave the chieftain to his bride."</p> 
                  <p>And Nina knelt at the feet of Julia, her clasped hands and tearful eyes raised towards her pitying face. A bright idea shot through her brain, and she smiled a joyful smile.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, child, I will promise thee that I will leave this place if thou wilt promise me to do whatsoever I shall tell thee. Thou knowest the youth that came here with me?"</p> 
                  <p>"The fair-faced young man with the rosy plume, with the soft blue eyes, that speaks to Nina of the youths of her native<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5727-00000049"/> France? Right well I know of whom thou speakest, lady, and I can have speech with him if such be thy pleasure, for here all doors open to me."</p> 
                  <p>"Go, then, Nina, fly as swift as thy little feet can patter along these gloomy halls. Go thou, and by some means which thou shalt invent, give him this note." And Julia rapidly tore a leaf from her tablet, and writing a few words in pencil, she gave it to Nina, who disappeared, and in the space of a few moments returned.</p> 
                  <p>"Lady," said she, "the youth is no longer there; Juan, the sentinel, is lying on the floor asleep, and they have changed their clothes. He is gone!"</p> 
                  <p>"He sleeps the last sleep, then, and ere this Miguel is on his way to Madrid," muttered Julia to herself, adding aloud, "Speak not a word of this to any one, dear Nina. Stay thou with me; thou shalt give me thy history, sweet girl, and we will while the hours away together."</p> 
                  <p>Nina, surprised at this outburst of kindness from one in whom she had expected to find an enemy, burst into tears, and threw herself into Julia's arms. Julia mingled her tears with those of the lost, betrayed maiden, who, happily for herself, could not know the degradation to which she had fallen. The hours passed on thus in mutual confessions and confidences, and night spread her pinions over the drowsy world. Nina was about to withdraw, when footsteps were heard hurrying to and fro in the corridors. Shouts, and cries, and exclamations, mingling together, gave signs of the commotion and tumult without. The next moment a mailed footstep was heard rapidly approaching the room in which the two young women were seated. The door was flung open with a crash, and Guy Romez stalked furiously into the apartment. He advanced towards Nina, and catching her by her long, flowing hair, he drew the dagger from his belt and plunged it, with a savage execration, in the breast of his victim. The poor murdered girl gave one shriek and fell to the floor. Raising herself on her arm, she exclaimed, feebly, "Take me in thine arms, Guy, thy Nina is dying. Let me lay my head upon thy breast and I am content."</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, die there, traitress as thou art. Never shalt thou touch the breast of Guy Romez. Thus, madam," he continued, turning to the horrified Julia, "thus, madam, we punish treason, and when you become what that thing is now, then take warning from her fate!"</p> 
                  <p>The unfortunate Nina was seen to go to the room of Don Miguel and to return. It was supposed that she had liberated and guided him from the cave. The brutal words of Guy Romez cut far deeper into that bleeding breast than did his murderous<pb n=""/> dagger. At that moment his quick ear caught the sound of conflict without, and he hastened from the cave.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE END.</head> 
                  <p>Julia supported the head of the dying Nina on her breast. Now that death was hovering over, with wings ready for flight, the light of madness that shone in her soft brown eyes faded away, and reason beamed once more from those pure orbs. Julia bent over her, weeping bitterly; her gentle heart was suffused with pity for the gentle being who, though so young, had yet suffered so much.</p> 
                  <p>Nina's pale lips tried to utter a prayer for her sinful soul. Julia bent down her head and whispered in the dying girl's ear, "Nina, remember, dearest, that <emph>He</emph> pardoned Mary, who had much sinned, because she had much loved!"</p> 
                  <p>It was as the breath of spirits on the heart of Nina; it seemed to her that angel voices were whispering in her ears and angel wings were fluttering around her to carry her to Heaven. What were the sights she saw that brought that heavenly smile to her lips, what were the whispered promises that bathed her soul in the sunlight of hope, it is not for mortal pen to write, nor mortal mind to determine. There, unconscious of the strife and tumult without, dreaming only of the holy calm within, with no agony and without pain, the spirit of the gentle sufferer escaped from earth, and let us hope, dear reader, Nina sleeps on her Gaspar's bosom once again.</p> 
                  <p>The lady Julia fell upon her knees, and burning, earnest prayers went up to Heaven from the pure fountain of her virgin heart. A step echoed behind her; she turned her head and she was seized in the arms of Guy Romez; his drawn sword, still in his bloody hand, was smeared and dabbled in gore, his dress was torn and disordered, and everything told of the dreadful struggle through which he had just passed.</p> 
                  <p>"All is lost!" he exclaimed, as he wound his arms around her form-"all is lost; but thou art still left to me; though I am conquered by his superior force, still I'll leave him something to regret during a long life of misery!"</p> 
                  <p>Julia slipped from his grasp, but she was again seized, and his hated embrace closed round her. In vain she implored and<pb n="110 (Illustration) -111" xml:id="VAC5727-00000050"/>

                     <pb n=""/> threatened; he heeded her not; her velvet dress was loose; her raven hair, unbound from its tresses, fell around her form; her pallid face and wild appealing eyes had no effect on the bandit save to push him still more determinately to his purpose. His breath was on her cheek, his foul lips had been pressed to hers, and Julia's strength was well nigh exhausted when a sabre waved in the air and fell on the head of Guy Romez. He released his prey, seized his sword and rushed furiously on his antagonist. The gallant Miguel met his attack with calm, determined bravery, for he knew that he was not only fighting for his life, but for the honor of her whose life was much dearer to him than his own life. Sparks flashed from the clashing blades, which leaped to and fro like living things; now high, now low, now covered with blood and flashing high again. Guy Romez lunged desperately forward; his foot slipped in the blood of Nina, and as he fell forward the sword of Don Miguel pierced his heart. A hellish curse, and a shriek of baffled revenge and lust broke from the bloody lips of the robber, and with the echo of that demoniac cry fled the spirit of the terrible GUY ROMEZ.</p> 
                  <p>READER, our tale is done for the present, when we inform you that Don Miguel and Julia were united but a short time after the scenes herein related. Of their offspring and their achievements in the war which has lately attracted the attention of the whole civilized world, we will speak in a book which will shortly follow this one, and in which, dear reader, if this tale has amused a leisure hour or two, we shall only be too happy to meet you again.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE MOUNTAIN-THE TWO HORSEMEN-THE SHOT-THE CAVE-JOHN A. MURRELL-THE OATH-"THIS COUNTRY SHALL BE AN EMPIRE!-ITS PEOPLE MY SLAVES"-THE TWIN BROTHERS.</head> 
                  <p>In the north-western part of the state of Alabama, and not far from the city of C--e, there is a high mountain, the sides of which are covered with rocks and small dwarf-like trees. The mountain rises in an almost perpendicular position from the ground; and few if any persons have ventured to climb up the sides. Those who have dared to surmount the many difficulties which lie in their way, speak with delight of the almost endless view of the surrounding scenery which may be had from the top. Far in the distance may be seen the river which gives the state its name; the white steeples and roofs of the city; the cattle grazing in the meadows; the white sails of the many vessels which glide up and down the river, and which add wealth to every place they visit. There may be heard the singing of the birds, the sighing of the wind among the trees, and the low rumbling murmur of the distant waterfall. It is a beautiful place, and if you once reach the peak of the mountain, you leave it with a sigh.</p> 
                  <p>This mountain is known by the name of "Murrell mountain," the reason of which will be seen hereafter.</p> 
                  <p>It was a dark and stormy night in November, year 18-, that two men might have been seen riding slowly along the road that led from the city to the mountain. One of them was a short, thin man, whose features were strongly marked with mildness and benevolence. He was dressed in a suit of black. In a belt around his waist were stuck a pair of pistols and a huge knife, made celebrated by its bearing the name of the gallant Col. James Bowie, of Texas. In the holsters of his saddle were a pair of large horse pistols, the barrels and handles of which were splendidly mounted. Hanging by a strap over his back<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5727-00000052"/> was a rifle, the bore of which was scarcely larger than a pin's head. To protect his arms from getting wet he wore a cloak over his shoulders, which almost concealed his features from view. His horse was of that small breed more noted for swiftness than strength. Every movement of this man, even to the lifting of his rein, was done in a studious manner. Few looking at him would have thought that he was one of the greatest villains that ever lived.</p> 
                  <p>His companion was full seven feet in height; his breadth across the shoulders was enormous; his eye was bright and piercing; his hair of a bright chestnut color; his forehead high and noble; his nose Roman. His face had that dark shade which indicates constant exposure to the sun. His clothes, though not very neat were yet clean. The bosom of his shirt was thrown open, exposing the broad bosom which lay beneath it, and which was of the same color as the face. He was armed like his companion, with the exception that his pistols were not ornamented, and his knife was somewhat larger. He also carried a huge axe in his belt.</p> 
                  <p>"Well," said the smaller of the two, "we have not much farther to go."</p> 
                  <p>"Glad to hear it," said the giant; "my clothes are wet through, and the moschetoes bite so that I can't stand it much longer."</p> 
                  <p>"Aye, you say truly," said the other; "this place is noted for its moschetoes, if nothing else. But hush! we are close to the mountain, and the sentinels may fire at us through mistake."</p> 
                  <p>The caution was not unnecessary, for hardly had the word been spoken, when a vivid flash of lightning revealed the figure of a man standing on one of the crags within fifty feet of them.</p> 
                  <p>"A gloomy looking place," said the giant, in a low voice. The other smiled.</p> 
                  <p>"Little do the inhabitants of yonder city," said he, "dream that I, the terror of the south-west, am so near them. They have spies scattered all over the country to catch me; but it is in vain. 'The Land Pirate,' as they delight to call me, is not to be caught so easily. Fools!" he exclaimed, shaking his clenched fist towards the city, "ye do not know that this country was made to be my empire; its people my slaves. Ere a year shall have passed, ye shall be slain, your houses destroyed; and by whom? The slaves of--"</p> 
                  <p>He paused suddenly, and fixed his dark eyes on the face of his companion, who, with head bent forward was eagerly listening to what he was saying.</p> 
                  <p>"You are not yet a member of our band," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"But I soon shall be," said the giant.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"True, but our secrets cannot be told to any one but the members."</p> 
                  <p>"Who goes there! who goes there!" shouted the sentinel, as a vivid flash of lightning revealed to him the two men. Without giving them time to reply, he raised his musket to his shoulders and fired. The bullet whistled between the two men without doing any mischief. "Friends!" shouted the smaller of the two; "friends! You are too quick with your gun;" he added, in a stern voice. "Lower the ladder."</p> 
                  <p>The sentinel obeyed. Both men sprang from their horses, and after tying them to a tree, they mounted the ladder, the smaller one leading the way. As soon as they reached the top, the sentinel spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"You bring a new man with you, captain."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. Are the men assembled?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"All?"</p> 
                  <p>"I believe so."</p> 
                  <p>"Keep a good look out. Come;" and taking hold of his companion's hand he plunged beneath a rock and touched a spring. Part of the rock immediately flew open, revealing a small entrance which had been cut through the solid rock. The captain drew the other into the passage.</p> 
                  <p>"Show a light within there," he said, in a loud commanding voice.</p> 
                  <p>The glare of several torches flashed along the walls. The captain again moved forward, followed by the other. After walking several rods he stopped.</p> 
                  <p>"Give me your hand," he said. "See you this narrow plank? Keep your eye on it; look neither to the right nor left. A false step and you are lost."</p> 
                  <p>"Why do you <choice>
                        <sic>not not</sic>
                        <corr>not</corr>
                     </choice> cover it over?" asked the other.</p> 
                  <p>The captain laughed.</p> 
                  <p>"You do not understand," he said. "When we are apprehensive of an attack from the police, when we are afraid that they have discovered our cave, we merely draw this board to the other side, and they, not knowing it, will fall at least fifty feet before they stop."</p> 
                  <p>His companion shuddered.</p> 
                  <p>"A happy contrivance, is it not?" said the captain. "But come; we have but a short distance to go."</p> 
                  <p>Both men stepped cautiously over the plank. On reaching the other side the captain clapped his hands three times. Scarcely had the echoes died away when an iron door flew open, and they found themselves in a large room, which was brilliantly illuminated by numerous torches stuck in the wall, and by an immense chandelier which hung from the ceiling.</p> 
                  <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5727-00000053"/> 
                  <p>For a moment the captain's companion closed his eyes: the light was too dazzling for him to bear. When he again opened them he started back in astonishment at the scene which met his view.</p> 
                  <p>The cave was filled with men; all of them, with the exception of the captain, wore dark cloaks and masks, which concealed their features from view. There were at least five hundred men in the cave. At the upper end of the cave was a raised platform, with three chairs on it. Two of these chairs were occupied; the middle one was empty. To conceal the bare walls, and to make the place look as comfortable as possible, large curtains hung from the ceiling to the ground. All of the men had their eyes fixed on the platform. For an instant the captain enjoyed the other's astonishment, and then waving his hand, he spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"I have brought a new man to join our league," he said. "Stand on that platform," said he. "Has any man anything to say against this man joining us?"</p> 
                  <p>For an instant the men silently surveyed him through their masks. One of them rose.</p> 
                  <p>"I know nothing against him," he said; and he seated himself.</p> 
                  <p>"If any man has anything to say against him," said the captain, "led him rise and speak."</p> 
                  <p>All remained seated.</p> 
                  <p>"Good," said the captain. "Are you willing to take the oath?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said the other, boldly.</p> 
                  <p>"Kneel," said the captain. The other obeyed.</p> 
                  <p>"Are you willing to be branded?" asked the captain.</p> 
                  <p>For a moment the other hesitated.</p> 
                  <p>"Where?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"On the breast."</p> 
                  <p>Without a word he bared his bosom. The captain waved his hand. A red-hot iron was brought him. For an instant he pressed it against the giant's breast, and then flung it into a tub of water which stood behind him.</p> 
                  <p>"Your name?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Charles Demmon," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Read the oath," said the captain.</p> 
                  <p>One of the men rose and read from a paper which was nailed on the table. Without faltering, the other pronounced the words after him.</p> 
                  <p>"Rise," said the captain, extending his hand. "You have known me under the name of Phillips; know me now under my real name-John A. Murrell."</p> 
                  <p>Demmon grasped his hand.</p> 
                  <p>"I knew you from the first," he said.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"Charles Demmon," said Murrell, "you are now a member of our band,-the dreaded banditti of the West. Soon you will know all our signs and pass-words. Do you know why this band is leagued together?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do not."</p> 
                  <p>"To promote the interests of its members; to make this country an empire; to make me its emperor. We count much upon the slaves of the South and South-west. Men of wealth and respectability, and even ministers of the gospel, belong to the band. Our influence is extended all over the States, from Maine to Texas. Our agents are in every place. Our wealth is immense, for we number among our members several of the best forgers and counterfeiters in the country. Your duty is, to do everything in your power to increase our influence. Remember you are ours, body and soul, and you must obey me. You will be surrounded with spies, who, if you attempt to betray us, will strike you dead. If you are in danger, you will only have to make this sign," and the captain made a sign with his finger, "and aid will come to you. If you are arrested, fear not to make the sign to the judge. Woe unto you if you attempt to betray us, for our power is great; our agents are everywhere."</p> 
                  <p>"You shall never have cause to regret my joining you," said Demmon. "Few equal me in strength; in all exercises I am a master."</p> 
                  <p>A few words more passed between them, and then the captain motioned Demmon to seat himself.</p> 
                  <p>"Men," said Murrell, "it is six weeks since our last meeting. What have you done to aid our cause?"</p> 
                  <p>One of them rose.</p> 
                  <p>"Speak," said Murrell.</p> 
                  <p>"I have gained thirty members," he said, with a look of pride.</p> 
                  <p>"Good," said Murrell.</p> 
                  <p>"And I," said another, "have passed all the money you gave me. I sold it all to one man, and he paid me in cash eighty thousand dollars."</p> 
                  <p>"Who is he?" asked Murrell.</p> 
                  <p>"A broker," was the reply; "his name is A--t Z--g."</p> 
                  <p>"Is he rich?" asked Murrell, quickly.</p> 
                  <p>"He is said to be a millionaire."</p> 
                  <p>"Good," said Murrell; "he is in our power. Think you he will join us?"</p> 
                  <p>"He dare not refuse," replied the other.</p> 
                  <p>Murrell drew a book from his pocket, and wrote the broker's name therein.</p> 
                  <p>"I will visit him to-morrow," he said. "What have you done, L--x?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not much," was the reply.</p> 
                  <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5727-00000054"/> 
                  <p>"Have you gained any members?"</p> 
                  <p>"No; but I have got my eye fixed on two persons."</p> 
                  <p>"Who are they?"</p> 
                  <p>"Brothers, twin brothers. They are so like each other that no one can scarcely tell them apart. They formerly resided in Baltimore, but have lately removed to the city near by. They work in a dry goods store."</p> 
                  <p>"Are you acquainted with them?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am."</p> 
                  <p>"Are they honest?"</p> 
                  <p>"They appear to be."</p> 
                  <p>"That is unfortunate."</p> 
                  <p>"It will not stand in the way."</p> 
                  <p>"No; I will visit them to-morrow."</p> 
                  <p>In an hour the meeting broke up. As Demmon entered the city, he exclaimed, "I shall find her yet! I shall find her yet!"</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE DRY GOODS STORE-THE TWIN BROTHERS-THE SISTER-THE BLOW-THE ARREST-THE TRIAL-W. . . . R AGAIN-JOHN A. MURRELL-THE OATH-THE PARDON-THE RING-THE DEPARTURE.</head> 
                  <p>In Weslyn street, near Caroline, stands a large and handsome brick building. The lower part is used as a dry goods store; the upper part, as a dwelling house. The store is fitted up in a superior manner. It is full one hundred feet deep, by twenty-five wide. Two large marble counters run from the front to the back. Behind the counters are numerous shelves, filled with dry goods. Behind one of these counters stands a tall, finely-formed young man, apparently between twenty-five and twenty-six years of age. His pale and intellectual countenance wears an air of sadness. His features are beautiful, and formed in the classic mould. His name is Albert B. Eganus.</p> 
                  <p>At the upper end of the store stands another young man, the exact counterpart of the other. He is dressed in the same manner;-his features wear the same air of sadness. No one can mistake him. His name is Cornelius D. Eganus, the twin brother of Albert.</p> 
                  <p>Seated on a stool, at the upper end of the store, is a tall, portly looking man. His face wears a smiling expression, which<pb n=""/> never leaves it. He is dressed in the most fashionable style. His name is W--r; he is the proprietor of the store.</p> 
                  <p>"Business is rather dull, to-day," said Mr. W--r.</p> 
                  <p>"Rather so," said Albert.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the door opened, and a young lady entered. Her features were very beautiful. Her face wore a winning smile, which added another charm to her features. She was attired in a close fitting silk dress; every movement was graceful; her teeth were pearly white, and her lips of a cherry red. As she entered, Mr. W--r raised his head.</p> 
                  <p>"By heavens!" he muttered to himself, "there she is again, and Oh! beautiful, more beautiful than ever. The fairest flower of Paradise would not equal her. Be still, thou throbbing breast, and let me hear her voice."</p> 
                  <p>"Ellen," said Albert, casting at the same time a glance to W--r, "you here again?"</p> 
                  <p>Ellen blushed deeply.</p> 
                  <p>"I could not help stopping to see you," she said. "A gentleman-a clergyman, I think-stopped at our house this morning."</p> 
                  <p>"What did he want?" asked Albert, quickly, and turning pale.</p> 
                  <p>"To see you," replied Ellen. "He left this note for you;" and she handed him a small, neatly folded note.</p>

                              <p>"Sir: I wish to see you this evening-say at eight o'clock. I have something of importance to say to you and your brother. Do not go out this evening.</p> 
                              <closer>
                                 <salute>Yours,</salute>

                  </q> 
                  <p>"Phillips! Phillips!" said Albert, musingly, "the name is unknown to me. What does he want with me?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do not know," replied Ellen. "You will not fail him. I think I have seen him before, but where I know not;" and with a pleasant smile she left the store.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. W--r rose from his chair and walked rapidly to and fro. There was a deep flush on his forehead, and his form trembled so that it required a violent exertion on his part to prevent the two clerks from noticing his agitation.</p> 
                  <p>"God help me!" he muttered to himself, "but I have tried in vain to subdue this passion which is now consuming my heart. Would that we had never met! "Would that the family had remained in Baltimore! I love her madly, and would make her mine; but my wife! Fool that I was to throw myself away upon her. But what has she to do with this new passion? Does she stand in the way? No! the brothers are poor, and Ellen is<pb n="120-121 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000055"/> an orphan. I am rich and respected. Money is power. To possess Ellen I would be willing to give one-half of my wealth. Were it not for her brothers I'd soon make her mine. Would that I could get them into my power. But a truce to these thoughts;" and he seated himself.</p> 
                  <p>Suddenly he spoke:</p> 
                  <p>"Did I not say yesterday that to-morrow we must take an account of stock?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," replied Albert, in a faint voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Get down the books," said W--r.</p> 
                  <p>In five hours they had taken "an account of stock," at the conclusion of which Mr. W--r manifested the greatest surprise.</p> 
                  <p>"Several very valuable things are missing," he said. "Hand me that book. Perhaps they were sold."</p> 
                  <p>"Strange," said he, a few minutes after; "I purchased three very valuable shawls last year. They are not among the stock, neither do I see them marked down in the sale-book."</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. W--r," said Albert, in a faltering voice, "the shawls were sold. I sold them."</p> 
                  <p>"But the money, where is it?"</p> 
                  <p>"It paid my father's funeral."</p> 
                  <p>A smile of joy passed over W--r's features.</p> 
                  <p>"Hear me," said Albert; "when we first came to the city we were poor, miserably poor. My mother was taken ill and she died. My father was taken ill; the weather was very cold, and he suffered greatly. Our wages were insufficient to support us. We owed the doctor a large sum. He refused to visit us again unless we paid him. What could I do? What would any one have done if he had been in my place?"</p> 
                  <p>"So, with the money you received for the shawls you paid the doctor?" said W--r.</p> 
                  <p>"Part of it paid him. I intended, as soon as my father got better, to return the money as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, he died, and the remainder of the money went to the sexton."</p> 
                  <p>"And so I am to lose that money?" said W--r, in a cold tone.</p> 
                  <p>"Not so," said the young man; "I will return it to you as soon as I can get it."</p> 
                  <p>W--r smiled grimly.</p> 
                  <p>"What if I were to bring an officer here and have you arrested?" he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, you will not do that," said Albert, entreatingly.</p> 
                  <p>"You would be tried, convicted, and sent to prison."</p> 
                  <p>Albert clasped his hands.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>
                     <figure> </figure>

                  <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5727-00000056"/> 
                  <p>"You would be pointed at, scorned-your reputation would be blasted forever."</p> 
                  <p>"Why torture me thus?" said Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"Your sister-how would she feel to see her brother in the felon's dock?" and the man bent his still smiling face upon the almost broken-hearted young man.</p> 
                  <p>"You will not do it!" said Cornelius.</p> 
                  <p>"I will;" and he rose.</p> 
                  <p>"Stay," said Albert, grasping his hand and sinking on his knees; "you surely will not do this."</p> 
                  <p>"But one thing will prevent me!"</p> 
                  <p>"And that is-what?"</p> 
                  <p>"Your sister."</p> 
                  <p>Albert turned pale.</p> 
                  <p>"Make her mine and"-</p> 
                  <p>With the quickness of lightning Albert raised his fist and dashed him to the floor. Then planting his foot firmly on his neck, he seized a stool, and raised it high above his head. Ere he could give the blow, Cornelius wrested it from him.</p> 
                  <p>"Rise," he said.</p> 
                  <p>Almost choking with passion, W--r obeyed, and shaking his clenched fist at Albert, he left the store.</p> 
                  <p>The two brothers looked at each other with dismay. Before they had time to speak, W--r returned, accompanied by an officer.</p> 
                  <p>"Arrest that man!" he said, pointing to Albert. The officer sprang forward and laid his hand on his shoulder. Albert did not resist him. In an hour he was in prison.</p> 
                  <p>Two hours after, he was visited by his sister, who attempted to console him, but it was in vain.</p> 
                  <p>Three hours after, he was tried and found guilty. The next day he would receive his sentence.</p> 
                  <p>The clock was just striking the hour of six when the door opened and W--r entered the cell. For an instant the young man glared at him, and then covered his face with his hands.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want here?" he asked suddenly.</p> 
                  <p>"To-morrow," said W--r, "you will be brought up to receive sentence."</p> 
                  <p>The young man shuddered.</p> 
                  <p>"Five years in prison."</p> 
                  <p>"Five years!" shouted Albert, springing from his chair. "Do you know what five years in prison are to the young heart? Five years! Good heavens! Three years will kill me."</p> 
                  <p>"I can save you."</p> 
                  <p>"How?"</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"The judge is my friend; he will do whatever I wish. Your sister-what say you?"</p> 
                  <p>"I," said the young man, hardly knowing what he was saying, "I--"</p> 
                  <p>"Refuse your offer," said a voice, and John A. Murrell, the land-pirate, entered the room. His features were concealed by a cloak.</p> 
                  <p>Albert and W--r gazed at him with astonishment.</p> 
                  <p>"What want you here?" cried W--r.</p> 
                  <p>"To converse with this young man," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Leave the room," said W--r, angrily.</p> 
                  <p>"Leave it yourself," said Murrell. "What! dare disobey me;" and Murrell threw open his cloak and exposed his features. W--r staggered back.</p> 
                  <p>"Go!" said Murrell, pointing to the door.</p> 
                  <p>Without daring to say a word, he left the place. When the noise of his retreating footsteps had died away, Murrell locked the door.</p> 
                  <p>"Your name is Albert B. Eganas," said he. The young man bowed his head. "My name," continued the other, "is Murrell."</p> 
                  <p>Albert half darted from his chair.</p> 
                  <p>"Sit still," said Murrell. "I have not long to stay, and when I begin a thing I always like to finish it as soon as possible. A few minutes ago I heard of your arrest and trial. To-morrow you will be sentenced to five years' imprisonment. I can save you."</p> 
                  <p>"At the same price W--r demanded?"</p> 
                  <p>"No; an easier one."</p> 
                  <p>"The price! the price?"</p> 
                  <p>"That you and your brother join my band."</p> 
                  <p>"But how can you save me?"</p> 
                  <p>"The judge, before whom you were tried to-day, belongs to my band. He has taken the oath, and is therefore bound to obey me in everything."</p> 
                  <p>"Enough," said Albert; "I am yours."</p> 
                  <p>"Think you that your brother will join us?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do!"</p> 
                  <p>Murrell was overjoyed.</p> 
                  <p>"You must take the oath now."</p> 
                  <p>"If you wish it-yes."</p> 
                  <p>Murrell administered the oath, and the young man slowly repeated it after him.</p> 
                  <p>"And now hear what you have to do," said Murrell, and he repeated, word for word, what he had told Demmon the last evening. The young man was horror-struck.</p> 
                  <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5727-00000057"/> 
                  <p>"Good heavens!" he exclaimed, "this is horrible."</p> 
                  <p>"Too late now," said Murrell, with a sardonic smile. "Better to live a life of pleasure than to die in prison."</p> 
                  <p>"Woe to the man who brought this upon me," said Albert. "W--r shall die a most horrible death."</p> 
                  <p>"Do as you please to him," said Murrell. "He is not a very valuable member; besides he is old. We want young men. Here are ten thousand dollars. They are counterfeits, yet no one can tell them from the real. When you have passed them, you must return me five thousand dollars in good money."</p> 
                  <p>Albert took the bills and thrust them in his pocket.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes the door opened and Cornelius entered. In a few words Albert informed him of what had occurred.</p> 
                  <p>"Since you wish it, dear Albert," he said, "I will join the league. Speak the oath, sir, I will repeat it after you."</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes Cornelius was a member of the league.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you wish to leave the prison now?" asked Murrell.</p> 
                  <p>"No; to-morrow will be time enough," was the reply; and seeing that his brother looked surprised, he added, "I wish to brood over my wrongs and think of vengeance."</p> 
                  <p>"It will be the best for you to leave the prison to-night," said Murrell. "Remain here till I return. I must get a pardon from the judge;" and he left the room.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes he returned. In his hand he held a paper.</p> 
                  <p>"Here is the pardon," said he. "Remember, in four weeks we meet at the cave. I will give you a sign by which you can gain admittance;" and he moved his hands in a peculiar manner. "Take this ring, and whenever you need help, show it;" and he left the room.</p> 
                  <p>A few words more passed between the brothers, and they both left the place. Soon they were walking swiftly towards their residence.</p>

                  <p>On leaving the prison, W--r hailed a cab. As it drew up to the sidewalk he sprang in. After receiving his orders, the driver drove at a smart pace towards the center of the city.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"Curses on Murrell!" muttered W--r to himself; "he defeated me at the moment of success. What does he want with Albert? Ah, I have it-to join the league. Albert will refuse him; of that I am certain;" and he closed his eyes. Suddenly he started up.</p> 
                  <p>"What a lucky thought!" he almost exclaimed. "She lives alone, and no one will interrupt us. Yes; I'll do it. Driver, turn your horse's head the other way. Drive to 56 W--m street. Stop at No. 30. She may be looking out of the window," he said, "and if she should see me, she would flee," and W--r rubbed his hands with glee.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes the cab stopped. W--r got out, paid the driver his fare, and dismissed the cab.</p> 
                  <p>"So far so well," said he; and in a few minutes he stood in front of the young lady's house. For a moment he hesitated, but mastering his fear, he mounted the steps, and turned the handle of the door. It was locked. He then rang the bell, and impatiently awaited for it to open.</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes he heard steps descending the stairs. Another moment and the key was turned. Without giving the young lady time to open the door, he turned the handle and sprang in, closing the door after him. On seeing him Ellen uttered a slight scream, and leaned against the wall for support.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Ellen," said W--r, with a triumphant smile, "you are now mine. No brother is here to save you."</p> 
                  <p>"Leave the house," said Ellen.</p> 
                  <p>"When you are mine-not before," was the reply.</p> 
                  <p>"Yours!" said Ellen, proudly, "I shall never be yours. Leave the house, or I will call for help."</p> 
                  <p>"Your cries will avail you nothing," said W--r; and rushing forward, he caught the young girl by the neck and covered her mouth with his hand. She struggled to free herself from his grasp, but it was in vain. Opening a door, he dragged her into a room and closed it. All this occupied several minutes.</p> 
                  <p>"You see you are in my power," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"God help me," murmured the poor girl. "Oh, Albert! would that you were here."</p> 
                  <p>"Albert is in prison," said W--r. "To-morrow he will be free. He has sold you to me."</p> 
                  <p>"Liar!" shouted a voice, and Albert sprang into the room, followed by his brother. For a moment the young man glared at W--r with a look in which joy and hate were intermingled together. W--r appeared like one paralyzed. Ellen uttered a scream of joy.</p> 
                  <p>The <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tableau</foreign> lasted but a moment. With one bound Albert caught the ruffian by the throat and bore him heavily to the<pb n="126-127 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000058"/> floor. At the same instant Cornelius snatched up an axe and raised it over his head.</p> 
                  <p>"Move your body a little, Albert," he said, for the young man stood in such a position that he could not strike without injuring his brother.</p> 
                  <p>"Spare me!" cried W--r, vainly endeavoring to rise, and holding up his hands entreatingly. "My God! you will not kill me! Spare-Oh! spare my life! For God's sake, spare--"</p> 
                  <p>The axe descended with such force that it buried itself in his brains. W--r half rose from the floor, clasped his hands together, as though entreating for mercy, and then fell dead upon the floor.</p> 
                  <p>"Good God!" cried Ellen, "what have you done?"</p> 
                  <p>"Sent the villain to where he belongs-to hell," said Albert.</p> 
                  <p>Cornelius dropped the axe, and for a moment stood terror-stricken at the deed he had committed.</p> 
                  <p>"Come! be a man," said Albert, laying his hand on his shoulder.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! brother! brother! how could you do it?" said Ellen, Sobbing.</p> 
                  <p>'Hush! would you alarm the neighbors by your cries?" said Albert. "What shall we do, Cornelius?"</p> 
                  <p>His brother made no reply to the question, but slowly raised his finger and pointed to the body.</p> 
                  <p>"He moves! he moves!" he cried. "Is he alive yet? Has his soul returned from hell to confront me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Hush!" said Albert, shaking him violently. "You know not what you say. He is dead. Ellen, a glass of brandy! quick!"</p> 
                  <p>"Drink," said Albert, when it was brought to him.</p> 
                  <p>His brother obeyed.</p> 
                  <p>"This is dreadful, Albert," he said.</p> 
                  <p>"It cannot be helped," said Albert. "What shall we do with the body?"</p> 
                  <p>Before Cornelius could reply, the door was dashed open, and several police officers rushed into the room. The body of W--r at once made them comprehend of what had occurred. The two brothers were seized, bound, and in another hour lodged in prison.</p> 
                  <p>"Our doom is sealed," said Cornelius, gloomily.</p> 
                  <p>"Not so," said Albert, who was the bolder of the two. "See," and he held up his finger. "I hold a ring which is almost as powerful as Alladin's lamp."</p> 
                  <p>Cornelius' features brightened up.</p> 
                  <p>The next morning, when the jailor entered the room, Albert asked, "Do you know Murrell?"</p> 
                  <pb n=""/>

                  <p>"What of him?" inquired the man.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you know him?" and Albert held up the ring.</p> 
                  <p>"I see you belong to the league," said the man. "I am also a member of it."</p> 
                  <p>"And by your oath you are bound to aid me."</p> 
                  <p>"Willingly. Do you wish to see Phillips?-our leader goes under that name in this city."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"He will be with you in an hour;" and the man left the room. In an hour Murrell entered.</p> 
                  <p>"A bad business," said he, "a very bad business. I saw your arrest in the papers."</p> 
                  <p>"We must escape," said Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"That can be easily arranged," said Murrell. "The jailer belongs to our league. We must bind him."</p> 
                  <p>"Bind him!" repeated Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes; we do matters in such a way that suspicion falls on no one. To-night, at nine, everything will be prepared."</p> 
                  <p>"But Ellen-what will become of her?"</p> 
                  <p>"She shall be attended to; fear not for her."</p> 
                  <p>"Whither shall we go?"</p> 
                  <p>"To the North. You can make a handsome living at the watering places. There you will not be recognized. Two fleet horses will be ready for you at the end of the city. I have a large number of counterfeit bills in my pocket, amounting to over one hundred thousand dollars. Had you not better take them? You can combine business with pleasure."</p> 
                  <p>"Let us have them," said Albert.</p> 
                  <p>Murrell drew a large roll of bills from his pocket, and handed it to Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"You will write to me often," said Murrell; "farewell; tonight we shall meet again."</p> 
                  <p>"We have no arms," said Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"I will supply you to-night," said Murrell, and he left the room. Evening came. At nine Murrell entered the rooms. The jailer suffered his arms to be bound behind him, joking all the time with the men. When this was done, they descended the stairs and left the prison. Soon they were mounted; the arms which Murrell had provided for them placed in their belts; and in an hour they had left the city far behind them.</p> 
                  <p>At noon they reached a small country tavern. Several men were lounging about the door. The two brothers threw themselves from their horses and called for wine. As they were something tired, they resolved to remain there all night. After drinking their wine, they requested the landlord to show them to their rooms.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"Don't make a noise," said the landlord. "A sick gentleman, as has lost his darter, is in the next room. The partitions are made out of boards, and o' course the least noise made in one room can be heard in the next."</p> 
                  <p>When night came, the two brothers undressed and went to bed. Through the cracks they saw a bright light shining in the next room. Suddenly they heard a door open. Albert motioned to his brother to keep silent, and springing from his bed, he applied first his ear and then his eye to one of the cracks.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you succeeded?" asked a voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Beyond my utmost expectations; so far as to gain an admittance into the cave," replied the other.</p> 
                  <p>"But my daughter-have you seen her?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not yet; but I hope to see her soon."</p> 
                  <p>"Is she in the cave?"</p> 
                  <p>"She must be; where else would Murrell put her?"</p> 
                  <p>"How are we to find out whether she is there or not?"</p> 
                  <p>"That is the difficulty. My plan is to get a large number of men together-this we can easily do by offering so much to every man-and to attack the cave."</p> 
                  <p>"Think you that you'll succeed?"</p> 
                  <p>"I should not attempt it if I were not sure of success."</p> 
                  <p>"Poor M--a," said the other.</p> 
                  <p>The sigh was echoed by his companion.</p> 
                  <p>This companion, as our readers may have suspected, was Demmon.</p> 
                  <p>"But how did you gain admittance into the cave?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am a member of the league."</p> 
                  <p>"Have you taken the oath?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes; but an oath made to such men is valueless;" and he informed the other what had occurred at the cave.</p> 
                  <p>"This is indeed a terrible plot," said the other. "The government must be informed of it at once."</p> 
                  <p>"This is sheer rashness," said Demmon. "If the leader is slain the league is destroyed."</p> 
                  <p>"'Tis lucky that our house is so near the cave," said the other.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps your negroes have been tampered with."</p> 
                  <p>"It may be so, but I'll soon find out. Do you intend to remain here all night?"</p> 
                  <p>"A few hours," replied the other. "Before daybreak I shall be up and far away. I will collect all my friends and you must collect yours. As Murrell says, 'every man helps.' Is the adjoining room occupied?"</p> 
                  <p>"I believe that the one on the right is."</p> 
                  <p>"You should have told me so when I first entered the room.<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5727-00000060"/> I'll sleep in the next room. If anything happens, call me;" and he left the room.</p> 
                  <p>For several moments the gentleman remained seated, with his face leaning on his hand, and his elbow resting on the table. At length he rose and went to bed. The lamp was extinguished, and all was darkness.</p> 
                  <p>"Cornelius," said Albert, bending over his brother, and speaking in a hurried tone, "did you hear their conversation?"</p> 
                  <p>"Every word."</p> 
                  <p>"What is to be done with him?"</p> 
                  <p>"Let Murrell settle with him."</p> 
                  <p>"Remember our oaths. We have sworn that if any suspicion rests on a member, to slay him."</p> 
                  <p>Cornelius shuddered.</p> 
                  <p>"What have we to fear," said Albert. "Remember that we are in Murrell's power, and if he should hear that we suffered this man to escape, he will say, 'behold the murderers of W--r."</p> 
                  <p>"And must we kill him?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes; have you not the heart to do it? You have only to hold him, and I will strike the blow."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! Albert, every murder makes Heaven recede from us, and brings us nearer Hell,"</p> 
                  <p>"Let us do the deed," said Albert. "Come; he is in the next room. My knife is sharp; a moment will finish the work."</p> 
                  <p>"And send a soul before its Maker."</p> 
                  <p>"Pshaw!" said Albert. "Get up; we will dress ourselves."</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes they were dressed.</p> 
                  <p>"Put your shoes in the pocket of your great-coat," said Albert, as he opened the door. A few steps brought them to the door of Demmon's room. Albert listened attentively.</p> 
                  <p>"He is sleeping," he said; and he opened the door without making any noise. A lamp was burning on the mantel-piece. Demmon lay asleep upon the bed. In one hand he held a small locket, the lid of which was open. Albert examined it. It was the picture of a young lady of the most surpassing beauty. Cornelius sighed as he beheld it; it reminded him of his sister. Demmon's features wore a smile; he was dreaming. His chestnut locks waved over his high and noble forehead. Both hands were folded over his broad bosom. His arms lay upon the table beside the bed. He was a very model of Hercules; he looked like a lover dreaming of his mistress.</p> 
                  <p>"Poor fellow," said Cornelius, "and must he die?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Albert, who, since the murder of W--r, appeared to have a delight for blood, "he must die."</p> 
                  <p>"Then strike?" said his brother. "If I remain here a moment<pb n=""/> ment longer, pity will take possession of my heart, and I shall awaken him. Strike, I say, for the angel of mercy is hovering over me with his wings."</p> 
                  <p>Without hesitating a moment, Albert raised the knife and plunged it into his heart. Demmon did not move, nor even groan. That one blow had freed his spirit, and he was-where?</p> 
                  <p>"The deed is done," said Albert, as he coolly wiped his knife on the sheets of the bed. "Let us see if he has any money about him;" and taking up the clothes which were lying on the foot of the bed, he emptied the pockets of their contents. There was a large purse filled with gold, and a pocket-book stuffed with bills. Albert chuckled over his ill-gotten gains.</p> 
                  <p>Hearing a noise, both turned toward the door. There stood the landlord, his features expressing both astonishment and fear. In his right hand he held a lamp; in his left a glass of wine, which it appeared the deceased man had sent him after.<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="WRIGHT2-0208-NOTE001" n="*"
                           place="foot">
                        <p >The landlord's wife stated to the Coroner that her husband was subject to fits, and that he always brought a glass of wine with him when he retired to his room. Many witnesses, who were acquainted with the landlord, stated the same. As but a few drops of wine were found, it is supposed that the murderers drank it.-<title>M--g Tribune,</title>
                        </p>
                     </note> Albert fixed his eye on him and moved slowly toward him. The landlord was too terrified to speak; his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth. He attempted to move-to raise his hand-but it was in vain. Slowly Albert approached his intended victim. His eyes did not wink, nor his hand tremble, even when he raised the fatal knife. Like a bird fascinated by the snake, the landlord suffered him to approach him. Albert gave him a blow in the breast and removed his eyes. The charm was broken.</p> 
                  <p>"Help! help! they murder me!" shouted the landlord. Repeatedly the assassin plunged the knife into his body. Suddenly his cries ceased, his eyes closed, and with a low moan he fell back-DEAD.</p> 
                  <p>The work was done, and the murderer rose. The glass of wine was lying upon the floor, and, strange to say, not a drop had been spilled. He stooped down and emptied the glass of its contents.</p> 
                  <p>"Let us escape," said Cornelius.</p> 
                  <p>Albert threw open the window; it was but twelve feet from the ground. He leaped out; his brother followed him. Hurriedly they made their way toward the stable. Suddenly a huge dog sprang up and caught Albert by the throat. One blow with his knife, and he was freed from this new enemy. The stable door was dashed open and the horses brought out. It took but a few minutes to place the saddles upon their backs. Hardly had they mounted them, when the door of the tavern<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5727-00000061"/> was thrown open, and several men came forth. By the light of the moon they beheld the brothers.</p> 
                  <p>"Shoot them down!" shouted one of the men; and drawing a pistol from his belt he fired. The ball passed through Cornelius' cap. Revenge prompted him to draw a pistol and fire in return. The man sprang several feet into the air, and fell dead.</p> 
                  <p>"Forward!" shouted Albert; and pressing his spurs into the animal's side, he leaped over the fence in gallant style. For an instant Cornelius' horse refused the leap, but a sharp cut over the neck with his whip caused him to make it.</p> 
                  <p>"Follow them!" cried one of the men; and the two brothers had not proceeded more than a mile, when they heard the sound of pursuing footsteps behind them. Each drew up at the same instant, and each held a cocked pistol in his hand. As they were standing in the shadow of a tree, the horsemen did not see them until it was too late. The two brothers fired at the same instant, and two saddles were empty. Then, again putting spurs into their horses' sides, they rode swiftly forward.</p> 
                  <p>When day broke, they had left the tavern far behind them.</p> 
                  <p>Reader, tales of blood are hateful to us. Would that this story were merely a fiction, but, alas! it is true, and we must give it as told to us by the brothers. Young man, master your passions while young, it cannot be done when old. Do not let your passions master you, but master them. Remember this.</p> 
                  <p>On reaching the city of Bornton, the young men went to the first hotel in the place, and ordered the finest apartments in the house to be placed at their disposal. As they were afraid that their resemblance to each other would betray them, they bought false beards, wigs, &amp;c.; and also ordered the landlord to send for Mr. H-, the merchant tailor. As soon as he came, they ordered him to measure them for several suits of clothes. They gave a short account of themselves to the landlord, in which they stated that they were cousins, and that their father had sent them to the city to inquire after an uncle by the name of Martyn. The landlord brought them a directory, and on opening it, they found that several persons in the city were named Martyn. They requested the landlord to send their meals up in their rooms, as they were bashful, and were not used to dining in a hotel. They also stated that they wished to sell their horses, and that they would let them go out of their hands for one half their value. The landlord, who suspected nothing, offered to purchase them, and to pay for them in cash, one thousand dollars. Albert saw a sprightly young negro boy playing about the floor, and he offered the landlord two hundred dollars for him. After a little wrangling about the price, the landlord consented, and Albert paid him in counterfeit money.</p> 
                  <p>As soon as their clothes were finished, they purchased tickets for New York, and having entered the cars, they were soon on their way to that far-famed city.</p> 
                  <p>It was several weeks after their departure before the landlord discovered that the money he had received from them was worthless. He raved and stormed, but it was of no use. He offered a large reward for their arrest, but years passed before he saw them again.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>

                  <p>New York City! Great thou art in riches, great thou art in crime. Many a young man hast thou ruined, many a felon hast thou made. Well worthy thou art of being called the "Empire City," for an empire thou art in crime and wretchedness.</p> 
                  <p>It was noon when the twin brothers reached New York. They were astonished at everything they saw; but as soon as they had somewhat recovered, they ordered a cab and were driven to the Astor House. On reaching it, they gave out that they were British noblemen, traveling for health and pleasure. Before night had drawn her curtain over the sky, numberless cards and invitations had been received. The two brothers were overjoyed at their success.</p> 
                  <p>"All goes well," said Albert. "That was a good thought of yours, the making out that we are lords. At any rate, we have more money than most lords have."</p> 
                  <p>"Let us visit the theatre," said Cornelius.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>"With pleasure. Waiter, call a carriage."</p> 
                  <p>A carriage was called and the two men stepped in. In an hour they reached the theatre. Neither of them had ever visited a place of amusement before. They were astonished at the large number of lights, and the splendor of the stage. The play was Macbeth, one of the most thrilling tragedies of the immortal Shakspeare. During the performance of the piece, Cornelius' agitation was excessive. When Macbeth made his exit to murder the king, it reminded him so forcibly of the murder of Demmon, that he was obliged to leave the theatre and return to the hotel.</p> 
                  <p>The next day they removed to a private house. That same evening they again visited the theatre, and when they returned, they found that their house had caught fire during their absence, and that nothing remained but a heap of smoking ruins. Unfortunately, they had left their money in their trunks, and, of course, it had been burned.</p> 
                  <p>"Altogether we have but fifteen dollars," said Albert, "and that, in a city like this, will last us but a few days."</p> 
                  <p>"What are we to do?" asked Cornelius.</p> 
                  <p>Before Albert could reply, he felt a touch on the shoulder which caused him to turn round.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want with me?" he asked, of a man who was dressed in livery.</p> 
                  <p>"Please, sir," said the man, with a low bow, and holding up a gilt-edged note, "my mistress told me to deliver this 'ere note to Lord Stanhope. Be that your name?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>Albert took the note, and breaking open the seal he read it. A smile passed over his features.</p> 
                  <p>"I will be there," he said to the servant, who immediately left him, after bowing several times.</p> 
                  <p>"What is it?" asked his brother.</p> 
                  <p>"Merely a note to attend a fashionable party this evening," said Albert carelessly. "It may be the means of putting money in our pockets," he added.</p> 
                  <p>That evening a carriage was ordered, and the two brothers entered it. In an hour they stopped before a large and handsome mansion on F-h avenue. Albert rung the bell, and the same servant who had handed them the note in the morning came to the door. On seeing them, he bowed to the floor, and bade them enter. When they had done so, he closed the door and led the way up a wide pair of stairs to the second story. Then, throwing open a door, he cried in a loud voice, "Lord Stanhope and his brother!"</p> 
                  <p>The room was filled with ladies and gentlemen, all of them dressed in the most fashionable style. On hearing the name, several of them made a rush toward the door. Among them was a lady of the most commanding beauty.</p> 
                  <p>"Back!" she exclaimed, waving her hand with the air of a queen. "Welcome, my lord. Make way there for Lord Stanhope;" and taking both their arms, she led them to the middle of the room.</p> 
                  <p>"You are Mrs. M--d?" said Albert, interrogatively.</p> 
                  <p>The lady bowed.</p> 
                  <p>"I have heard of your arrival and the destruction of your house by fire," she said, "and, as you are a stranger in a strange land, I could do no better than to invite you to my house."</p> 
                  <p>Albert smiled.</p> 
                  <p>"How like they are to each other," said a young lady, in not so low a tone but that Albert heard her.</p> 
                  <p>"This is Miss M--d, my daughter."</p> 
                  <p>Albert bowed; and as the music was striking up, he requested the honor of her hand for the next dance, which happened to be a waltz. She graciously consented. While they were dancing, Albert observed that she wore a very beautiful gold watch.</p> 
                  <p>"I may as well begin my career as a pickpocket here;" he muttered to himself; and watching his opportunity, he drew the watch from her neck without being observed by any one. Soon the dance was ended, and both seated themselves.</p> 
                  <p>"How do you like the country?" said Miss M--d, who wished to engage him in conversation.</p> 
                  <p>"Very well, considering the short time I have been in it," was the reply; and he fixed his fine dark eye on her face. It was then that he noticed that she was very beautiful.</p> 
                  <p>"How long do you intend to remain here?" she asked.</p> 
                  <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5727-00000062"/> 
                  <p>"I did intend to remain here a year, but I lost all my money and drafts by the fire last evening, and I must return to England for more."</p> 
                  <p>The young lady blushed slightly as she said,</p> 
                  <p>"My mother will lend you money to any amount."</p> 
                  <p>"Just as I expected," said Albert to himself; "but," he added aloud, "I am a stranger to your mother, she knows me only by name."</p> 
                  <p>"That will make no difference," said the young lady.</p> 
                  <p>"Really, my lord," said a fine, matronly looking woman, approaching, "you occupy yourself too much with Miss M--d."</p> 
                  <p>"Excuse me," said Albert, with a smile, and rising; "her conversation was so interesting that I quite forgot myself," and he made a low bow.</p> 
                  <p>As to Miss M--d, she looked daggers at the lady, who returned her look with a smile. Albert noticed it, and his heart beat with joy.</p> 
                  <p>"Let me introduce you to my niece, Miss Anna H--; Anna, this is Lord Stanhope."</p> 
                  <p>The young lady rose.</p> 
                  <p>"Be seated," said Albert, seating himself in a chair by her side. They had not conversed long when the mistress of the house approached.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish to speak with you in private, my lord," she said.</p> 
                  <p>Albert rose from his chair, and walked with her to an inner room.</p> 
                  <p>"You had a short conversation with my daughter a few minutes ago," she said. "You lost all your money by fire last evening. Oblige me by accepting this. It is a check for five thousand dollars."</p> 
                  <p>"How can I thank you for this unexpected kindness?" said Albert, as he placed the check in his pocket-book.</p> 
                  <p>"By saying nothing about it," replied the lady.</p> 
                  <p>"Madam, the generosity of the Americans is proverbial all over the world," said Albert, "but little-"</p> 
                  <p>The lady covered his mouth with her hand.</p> 
                  <p>"No thanks," she said with a smile. "You can repay me when I visit England."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! then you must visit my castle," said Albert. "I shall have great pleasure in showing you over London."</p> 
                  <p>"Your arm," said the lady as she opened the door. "What do you think of our American ladies?"</p> 
                  <p>"I think they are very beautiful," said Albert; "and, moreover," he added, as he subtracted a splendid bracelet from her arm, "I think they have a great taste for jewelry."</p> 
                  <p>"You flatter us," said the lady, smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Upon my honor, no," said Albert. "My words come from the heart."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment a short, pompous looking gentleman came up. His clothes, though fashionable, sat awkwardly upon him, and he had that nervous air belonging to persons who are not used to good society. On his fingers he wore several magnificent rings, and in the bosom of his shirt was a splendid diamond breastpin.</p> 
                  <p>"This is my husband, Mr. M--d," said the lady. "This is Lord Stanhope, my dear."</p> 
                  <p>"Very much delighted to see you, my lord," said Mr. M--d, extending his hand, and speaking in a hurried manner, as though he wished to get over the form of introduction as soon as possible. "Bad affair, that of your house;-very sorry-wife could speak of nothing else all day long."</p> 
                  <p>"How proud I am to make your acquaintance," said Albert, laying his hand on his neck. This appeared to delight the other extremely, so much so that Albert managed to slip the breastpin from his shirt, and put it in his pocket.</p> 
                  <p>"Excuse me a moment," said Albert, "I wish to speak with my brother;" and he left them. Cornelius was standing near a window, conversing with Miss M--d. Albert approached him, and made a sign that he wished to speak with him.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you done anything?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," replied his brother-"three gold watches."</p> 
                  <p>"Good; we are getting along famously," said Albert. "We are worth at least ten thousand dollars now. What a handsome breastpin your partner has got."</p> 
                  <p>Cornelius took the hint.</p> 
                  <p>"I will get it," he said. "Let us separate: see how the people are eyeing us."</p> 
                  <p>Albert again approached Mr. M--d and entered into conversation with him. Soon he managed to ease him of his watch.</p> 
                  <p>"Is it not supper time, my dear?" said Mrs. M--d.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>Mr. M--d put his hand in his vest pocket to feel for his watch, but it was not there. At the same instant he heard his daughter's voice exclaiming,</p> 
                  <p>"My watch is gone. Somebody's took my watch."</p> 
                  <p>"D-n me!" exclaimed Mr. M--d, "if I know where my watch is gone to."</p> 
                  <p>"My bracelet!" cried Mrs. M--d; "I've lost my bracelet!"</p> 
                  <p>Albert thrust his hand into his pocket.</p> 
                  <p>"Somebody's picked my pocket!" he exclaimed.</p> 
                  <p>"And mine!" cried his brother.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. M--d sprang to the door, and leaned with his back against it.</p> 
                  <p>"No one shall leave this house without being searched!" he exclaimed.</p> 
                  <p>Albert turned pale, but he still retained his self-possession. He sprang to Mr. M--d's side. Cornelius managed to slip through a side door into the hall. Knowing that everything depended upon himself, he entered the ladies' dressing-room, and seizing a lamp, he set fire to the curtains. In an instant the room was filled with smoke, which passed through the hall into the ball-room.</p> 
                  <p>"Fire! fire! the house is on fire!"</p> 
                  <p>The ladies screamed, and several of them fainted. Several of the gentlemen opened the window and leaped out. As to Albert and his brother, they showed their agility by leaping through the window, and running up the street. A cab was passing by; they hailed it and sprang in.</p> 
                  <p>"Where to?" asked the driver.</p> 
                  <p>"The Astor House."</p> 
                  <p>In an hour they reached it.</p> 
                  <p>"We must leave this city as soon as possible," said Albert. "How did the house catch fire?"</p> 
                  <p>"I fired it," replied his brother.</p> 
                  <p>"It was well done-just in the nick of time, too. I hope the house is insured:" and he laughed heartily.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you intend to visit Saratoga?" asked Cornelius.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," replied Albert. "We will take the cars for that place to-morrow. Let us go to bed. Good night."</p> 
                  <p>The next morning they were <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en route</foreign> for Saratoga.</p>

                  <p>In ten hours they reached Saratoga. The hotels were all crowded, but a few extra dollars secured them rooms at the United States hotel-the largest hotel in the place. Although somewhat fatigued, their curiosity to see the springs was so great that they resolved to visit them that evening. Accordingly, as soon as they had finished their supper they walked down Broadway to the Congress spring. After drinking several glasses of the water, they walked to the Indian encampment at the lower end of the village. Then they visited the Iodine spring, the Empire spring, the Putnam spring, &amp;c., and then visited the Pavilion theatre situated in front of the Pavilion spring. Then, feeling somewhat tired, they returned to their hotel.</p> 
                  <p>The next morning the rain poured down in torrents, and this, of course, confined them to the house. Albert entered into conversation with a young man, and discovered that he was the son of a wealthy planter in Georgia. His father had sent him to the North to purchase railroad stock-some thirty thousand dollars worth-and he had the money in his pocket. Albert's eye watered on hearing this, and he resolved that the money should change hands. At noon the rain ceased, and Albert invited the young man to go with him to the Indian encampment. He consented, and in company with Cornelius they set out. After remaining a short time at the encampment, they walked toward the open country. Soon they had left the village several miles behind them. Albert looked around him. No one was in sight. Cornelius engaged the young man in conversation, while Albert, watching his opportunity, thrust his hand in his pocket and drew forth a well <choice>

                     </choice> pocket-book. Before he could thrust it into his pocket the young man turned round, and seeing his pocket-book in Albert's hand he drew a Bowie knife and held it high above his head.</p>

                  <p>"Would you rob me?" he exclaimed. "Return me my pocket-book."</p> 
                  <p>"Take it; I was merely joking," said Albert, throwing the pocket-book on the ground; and, as the young man stooped to pick it up, he caught him by the hair, and twisted the knife from his hands. Then, before he could utter a cry, he drew the knife across his throat with such swiftness, that it completely severed the head from the body.</p> 
                  <p>"It is done," were the murderer's first words.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes! it is done, and retribution has yet to come!" shouted a voice near them; and a man on horseback dashed past them. For an instant their eyes met, but that one instant served to engrave his features on the murderer's heart.</p> 
                  <p>"Let us leave the place," he said, as soon as the man had disappeared.</p> 
                  <p>That evening they left the village and journeyed toward Montreal. The next morning they reached it.</p> 
                  <p>Reader, it is not our intention to detail all their adventures. Even if we wished it, our pen would refuse it. Our soul is already sick at the many scenes of horror we have been obliged to delineate. Would to heaven that the work were merely a fiction, but alas! it is not.</p> 
                  <p>In Montreal, Cornelius made the acquaintance of a young lady by the name of Harriet C--. Under a promise of marriage he seduced her; and, in a few weeks, growing tired of her, he gave her fifty dollars and set her adrift upon the wide world. Her brother, hearing of it, challenged Cornelius, and a duel was the consequence. They met, and the young man fell. As there were some suspicions of foul play, the brothers were obliged to leave the city. In two weeks they landed in Boston. They remained there but a few days, and then set out for Murrell's Mountain. To reach it they were obliged to pass through the city in which they had committed their first murder. In order to do this without being discovered, they disguised themselves so effectually that even their nearest friends would not have known them if they had met with them.</p>

                  <p>On entering the city their first thought was a visit to their sister Ellen. Accordingly they rode over to her house, but to their astonishment they discovered that she was not there-that the house was empty and destitute of furniture. A lady in the next house who saw them, beckoned to them, and as they entered her room she asked,</p> 
                  <p>"Are you looking for Miss Ellen Eganas?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," replied Albert, "she is my cousin, and I wish to see her very much. Can you tell me where she has gone to?"</p> 
                  <p>The lady requested the two brothers to be seated, and then informed them that Ellen's two brothers had murdered a man and fled the city. That a few days after they had left, a man who appeared to be a minister called at her house, and stated that her brothers had sent him to take care of her. That he took her to balls and places of amusement, and under a solemn promise of marriage seduced her. That in a few weeks he abused her, and to escape him Ellen fled with a gentleman she was well acquainted with, and who was one of the richest men in the city; and that was all she knew about her.</p> 
                  <p>"But this clergyman-his name?" asked Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"Philips."</p> 
                  <p>Albert grasped his brother's arm and dragged him into the next house.</p> 
                  <p>"Brother," he murmured in a hoarse voice, while a strange light beamed from his eye, "know you not that Philips and John A. Murrell are one and the same person?"</p> 
                  <p>"My God! can it be possible?"</p> 
                  <p>"It is more than possible-it is true. Cursed be the arm that struck my sister low. But I will avenge her;" and he took a fearful oath. "Aye! I swear to follow him, if need be, to the end of the earth, and wreak my vengeance on him. Murrell, beware, a bloodhound is upon your track. You have escaped the officers; you cannot escape him."</p> 
                  <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5727-00000064"/> 
                  <p>That evening they left the city and proceeded to the mountain. On reaching it, Albert gave the password and entered the cave. It was crowded as before; but Murrell was not there. The members gave them all the signs and passwords; and one of them who acted as captain when Murrell was absent, gave them a large sum in counterfeit money. After waiting several hours they left the cave. For three months they remained in the city, hoping to hear from their sister Ellen, but she did not appear. Albert forged a check for ten thousand dollars on a rich merchant and got it cashed. At length, growing tired of the city, they left it and proceeded south. On their way they stole several horses and negroes, and sold them for a large sum in New Orleans. The brothers were men no longer; they were fiends-devils in human shape. Well worthy were they of belonging to the dreaded Banditti of the West."</p> 
                  <p>On reaching New Orleans they lost all their money at the gambling table. Albert discovered that one of the gamblers lived in a house near the levee. He also discovered that he was worth several hundred thousand dollars, and that he kept the enormous amount in an iron box under his bed. He resolved to enter the house that evening, to kill the gambler, and to make off with the money.</p> 
                  <p>That night both brothers armed themselves, and set out for the gambler's house. It required but a few minutes for them to cut a pane from the window and crawl in. Albert carried a dark lantern in his pocket, but he did not light it. They drew off their boots and mounted the stairs. Each carried his Bowie knife in his hand. Soon they reached the top of the stairs. Then, feeling their way along the wall, they stepped lightly forward! Soon they reached a door. They softly opened it and entered. The moon cast a dim light through the window into the room. They saw the gambler lying on the bed, and by his side a female. Albert stepped lightly across the room, and raising his knife, he aimed a tremendous blow at his breast. At that instant the gambler stirred, and the knife passed through the bed-clothes into the wood. The shock jarred the bed with such force that it awoke the gambler. He saw a dark figure standing at his bedside, holding an uplifted knife in his hand. The gambler comprehended all. Thrusting his hand beneath the pillow, he drew a large Bowie knife, and made a thrust at Albert with it. Albert sprang one side, and before the other could again raise the knife, he brought his own with terrible force on his head. With a groan the gambler sank back. At the same instant the female uttered a cry for help. "Strike her!" cried Albert, thrusting his hand over her mouth. His brother made a pass at her with his knife, but the blade missed its object and buried itself among the bed-clothes. Again Cornelius raised the knife, and this time the blade passed through her heart. Albert drew the dark lantern from his pocket, and throwing up the side he lit it.</p> 
                  <p>"Let us see who the female is," he said, and he turned the lamp upon her face. He had hardly done so when he uttered a piercing cry, dropped the lantern, and staggered back.</p> 
                  <p>"Gracious God!" he exclaimed in a voice of horror-"we have murdered our sister!" and he covered his face with his hands.</p> 
                  <p>Oh man! man! well may you say, "Crime meets with its own reward." God has punished you. No more shalt thou be happy. Thy career of crime is almost over. A few days more and thou shalt perish on the gallows.</p> 
                  <p>When Albert raised his head, he discovered that the lantern had set fire to the bed. His brother was gazing on the corpse with an expression of terror. Albert was the first to recover from his astonishment.</p> 
                  <p>"Come," said he, laying his hand on his shoulder, and speaking in a husky voice, "let us leave the house."</p> 
                  <p>Cornelius drew a flask of brandy from his pocket, and passed the contents down his throat.</p> 
                  <p>"Shall we take the money with us?" asked Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"No!" almost screamed his brother; "it would burn my fingers; 't is made of my sister's blood."</p> 
                  <p>A wild light gleamed from his eye as he spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"Fire! fire!" shouted a voice from the street.</p> 
                  <p>"Let us leave the place," said Albert; "quick, or we shall be discovered."</p> 
                  <p>They left the house without being discovered, and without taking the money with them.</p> 
                  <p>Three days afterward, and they landed at S--h, Ga.</p>

                  <p>At S--h they gave out that they were two Russian noblemen. As usual in such cases, the aristocracy of the city sent them numerous cards, and invitations to attend balls, parties, etc. Of course the brothers took advantage of this, and not a day passed without bringing them a large amount of money. As fast as they made money they gambled it away. They did not care whether they won or lost; they gambled for the mere intoxication it produces. Often they would sit down and gamble away fifty or even a hundred thousand dollars, and then rise and leave the table with a smile.</p> 
                  <p>Soon it was rumored through the city that the brothers were worth fifty or sixty millions of roubles. Invitations poured in upon them. They strove to forget their murdered sister, but it was in vain. She was ever before them. Conscience, that still, small voice, troubled them, and remorse was gnawing at their hearts.</p> 
                  <p>One evening the brothers received an invitation to attend a ball. They went. The rooms were crowded with the beauty and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite</foreign> of the city. All crowded around the two Russian noblemen, and many were the toasts drunk to their health. Albert's partner was a handsome young lady, the daughter of a wealthy cotton planter. As soon as the dance was over, Albert led her to a sofa, and seated himself by her side.</p> 
                  <p>"Dis be a ver fine cite," he said, in broken English.</p> 
                  <p>"You should visit our watering places," said the young lady.</p> 
                  <p>At this moment a gentleman came up and introduced the Russian embassador.</p> 
                  <p>"Speak to me in de English tongue," said Albert, smiling. I no speak my native language dis night. I be an American dis night."</p> 
                  <p>The gentleman suspected nothing and after a short conversation, he left him. Suddenly the music struck up.</p> 
                  <p>"Will you dance?" asked the young lady.</p> 
                  <p>"No; I feel ver tire," replied Albert; and he gazed around the room. Suddenly his eye fell on a face that had haunted him for years. It was the man who had witnessed the murder of the planter's son at Saratoga. At the same instant the man's eye met his, and he made a movement of surprise. Without a word, he turned and left the room.</p> 
                  <p>"He did not recognize me," said Albert to himself.</p> 
                  <p>"Look at your brother," said the young lady, pointing to Cornelius, who was staggering about the room.</p> 
                  <p>"He be vat you call inebriated," said Albert. "Vere you live?"</p> 
                  <p>"In the city;" and she handed him a card.</p> 
                  <p>"You got a brother?"</p> 
                  <p>"I had a brother once," said the young lady in a mournful tone.</p> 
                  <p>"Vere is he?" asked Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"Dead," replied the young lady, raising her handkerchief to her eyes. He was murdered."</p> 
                  <p>"Murdered!" repeated Albert, slightly starting; "where? where?"</p> 
                  <p>"At Saratoga-three years ago."</p> 
                  <p>Albert sprang from his chair, and darted to the window, which he threw open.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh God," he muttered, "thy vengeance is pursuing me."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment the door opened, and several police officers entered. They were followed by the stranger.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is he?" asked one of the officers.</p> 
                  <p>"There," said the stranger, pointing with his finger to Albert.</p> 
                  <p>One of the officers approached him.</p> 
                  <p>"In the name of the law, we arrest you for the murder of Henry--at Saratoga, three years ago."</p> 
                  <p>"Arrest that man also," said the stranger, pointing to Cornelius. Several of the officers sprang toward him.</p> 
                  <p>"It was I that done the deed!" shouted Cornelius, as he leaned against the wall. "Back! back! thou gory phantom!" he exclaimed. "Art thou returned from the grave to pursue me?"</p> 
                  <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5727-00000065"/> 
                  <p>"Arrest him!" shouted the stranger.</p> 
                  <p>"Back!" cried Albert, drawing his Bowie knife. "The first man who approaches me, dies."</p> 
                  <p>"At him!" cried one of the officers. Several of them precipitated themselves upon him, and in spite of his struggles, he was secured and bound. Cornelius made no resistance, but suffered his arms to be bound behind him.</p> 
                  <p>"There must be some mistake here," said the gentleman of the house.</p> 
                  <p>There is none," said the stranger. "What his name is, I know not; but of this I am certain, and that is, that he murdered Henry--at Saratoga."</p> 
                  <p>"The proof!"</p> 
                  <p>"My own eyes. I saw him do it."</p> 
                  <p>Albert hung down his head.</p> 
                  <p>"Hold up your head," said one of the officers. "Ho! he wears a wig, does he," he added; "and a false beard, too, as I live."</p> 
                  <p>At this moment, one of the men passed through the crowd.</p> 
                  <p>"If I am not mistaken," he said, "this is the man that passed a large sum of counterfeit money on me several years ago. Yes, I am certain of it. I purchased a pair of horses of him for one thousand dollars, and got no good out of them, for they were stolen."</p> 
                  <p>Another man pressed forward.</p> 
                  <p>"I recognize this man," he said. "I knew him well in the city of C--e. He is one of the far-famed twin brothers. He murdered Mr. W--r. His name is Albert B. Eganas; the other is his brother, and his name is Cornelius D. Eganas."</p> 
                  <p>"And I," said a woman, stepping forward, "recognize him as the murderer of Charles Demmon, and of my husband, Nicholas D--."</p> 
                  <p>Albert covered his face with his hands.</p> 
                  <p>"Come," said the officer, laying his hand on his shoulder.</p> 
                  <p>"Where?" asked Albert, faintly.</p> 
                  <p>"To prison."</p> 
                  <p>"God have mercy on me," he said, and fell senseless on the floor.</p> 
                  <p>In an hour the brothers were lodged safely in prison.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE PRISON-THE TWIN BROTHERS-REPENTANCE NEVER TOO LATE-THE EXECUTION.</head> 
                  <p>A few days passed, when the brothers were brought out to the court house for trial. They were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to be executed.</p> 
                  <p>When taken back to prison, I visited them. Albert was lying on his bed, his face covered with his hands. Cornelius, who appeared to be very ill, was lying upon the floor. As I entered, Albert sprang up.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want here?" he asked, as though angry at being disturbed.</p> 
                  <p>"To do God's work," I replied.</p> 
                  <p>"God!" exclaimed Albert; "there is no God! I do not believe it! There is none-none!"</p> 
                  <p>"Wretched man," said I; "you do not believe in Him who is now punishing you."</p> 
                  <p>"Peace!" cried Albert. "I tell you there is none; and if there were, why did he bring me here? Why did he make me what I am?"</p> 
                  <p>"To bring--"</p> 
                  <p>"Silence!" exclaimed Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"I must do my duty," said I; and I seated myself upon the bed. With a curse Albert sprang toward me, and raised his hand to strike. I folded my arms and looked him calmly in the face. There was something in my eye that appalled him. His uplifted hand fell, and he trembled violently.</p> 
                  <p>"In a few hours you will be dead," said I.</p> 
                  <p>"Why remind me of my condition?" cried Albert. "Is it to torment me that you are here?"</p> 
                  <p>"In a few hours," said I, "you will stand before your Maker."</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>Albert turned pale.</p> 
                  <p>"Remember, unless you repent, you will be in a place of torment forever." Albert extended his hand.</p> 
                  <p>"Your mother-"</p> 
                  <p>"My mother," said Albert, the tears dropping from his eyes as he spoke. "Man, my mother's name has conquered me. Speak, and I will listen."</p> 
                  <p>Long and earnestly I conversed with him. When I left him he appeared much affected. He was on the road to repentance.</p> 
                  <p>"God will thank you for this," he said; "I cannot."</p> 
                  <p>That evening I again visited him. During my absence he had conversed with his brother Cornelius, and had brought his mind to a sense of repentance. He gave me a long account of his career in crime, beginning with the murder of W--r, and ending with his last robbery. When he spoke of his sister Ellen, he wept. I shuddered at the awful recital.</p> 
                  <p>"Young man," said I, "your sins have been great, but not too great but that God will forgive you. Pray to Him who hath said, repent, even if it be at the eleventh hour, and I will forgive thee."</p> 
                  <p>"I do repent," said Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"And do you not fear death?" I asked.</p> 
                  <p>"No; we wish to die," replied both.</p> 
                  <p>After presenting each of them with a Bible, I left them.</p> 
                  <p>The day on which they were to be executed came at last. I had remained with them the whole preceding night. Both requested me to accompany them to the scaffold. Soon the sheriff entered, and proceeded to bind their hands behind them. As he appeared to be a little harsh to the prisoners, I requested him to act as gently as possible. Soon the bell struck, and they were led forth. The houses around the prison were crowded with people, who wished to view the coming execution. I walked by the prisoners' sides, whispering words of consolation in their ears. Soon we reached the scaffold. I offered Albert my hand to lift him up the steps, but he refused it. Soon we stood on the scaffold. For an instant Albert's eye wandered to the housetops, and then around the prison yard till it rested on the scaffold. He shuddered slightly as he beheld it, but it was not with fear, it was at the manner in which he was about to die.</p> 
                  <p>"If you have anything to say," said the sheriff, holding up his watch, "say it. You have five minutes before you."</p> 
                  <p>"I have only this to say," said Albert, stepping to the edge of the scaffold, and slightly elevating his hand as he spoke: "I die guilty of all the crimes which have been laid to my charge. May God have mercy on my soul."</p> 
                  <p>"Have you anything to say?" asked the sheriff of Cornelius.</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing, except that I die guilty of all the crimes which have been laid to my charge. May God have mercy on my soul. Remember me, good people, in your prayers to-night, and pray God to have mercy on me."</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Ransom," said Albert, "beneath the pillow of my bed you will find a manuscript. Will you please publish it to the world, and show the young men the rock on which I have fallen."</p> 
                  <p>"I will," said I, much affected.</p> 
                  <p>"God bless you," said Albert; and turning to the sheriff he added: "I am ready." The sheriff placed the ropes around their necks, and seized the axe.</p> 
                  <p>"Adieu," said Albert.</p> 
                  <p>"Adieu," echoed his brother.</p> 
                  <p>The drop fell. For a moment they struggled in the air; the next, their struggles ceased, and the twin brothers were dead.</p> 
                  <p>God have mercy on their souls.</p>

                  <p>The above truthful lines, from Byron, exhibit the purpose of this work. It is to aim at reform, by relying upon truth for our examples. Fiction may be powerful, but we verily believe that one grain of truth is more fruitful of good effects, than bushels of romance. A career of good, penned upon paper, may sound well to the youthful aspirant; but when he tries to pursue the course thus pointed out for him by the novelist, he finds himself pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp, a chimera or bugbear. And very often the youth, ardent and sanguine, and unused to defeat and discomfiture, turns away with a sick heart, having in vain sought after good, upon the romancist's model; and then he may fall into vice after vice, saying that there is no good, nor road to good, in this sinful world. But take A. B., or C. D., for example, who are living in the next street, and have accumulated wealth by industry, and established a good name by their own honest efforts; and such a picture will establish more solidity and purpose in the mind of a youth, than all the fanciful paintings of the romancist's brain. Having faith in these views, we have selected two characters-twin sisters; one of whom, it will be painfully remembered, was very recently executed for the dreadful crime of murder; the other prematurely finished a career of sin. And we shall show, in as graphic a manner as we are competent of, consistent with the facts in the case, how, step by step, these young and beautiful girls fell into the depths of wickedness and shame; so that their lives, if of no use to themselves, may be productive of that result which our great Maker designed, a warning, a reproof, and a lesson abounding in wholesome, honest truths. In the course of these pages, we shall give some scenes repulsive to the reader, as well as to ourself; but we are pledged strictly to follow our text. We shall avoid everything which might sound harshly upon the most fastidious ear. We shall not imitate the romancist, who panders oftentimes to the passions and vitiated tastes of his<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5727-00000067"/> readers. No, our little work shall contain nothing which may be construed into licentiousness; but rather, all that may be considered moral. We aspire to making our simple narration of these two young girls, a class-book of truth, a companion book for young men, and a reference of consequences for young women. We hope that it may be admitted to the domestic fireside, and that the rich tones of the father may read it aloud to his family; and that its fruits may be told in the righteousness of future generations.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <p>PHILADELPHIA, on a light and brilliant day, when the dome of heaven is clothed in blue, deeper in tint as it reaches to the far-off horizon, and bright and clear o'er our heads, relieved by scattering clouds, that appear as golden feathers along the sky; what a sight art thou! with one of thine arms resting upon the heaving bosom of the delicious Delaware, and the other extending to the serpentine Schuylkill, who revel in and partake of thy charms, and whose unmatchable beauties contribute so much to thy fair fame, and envied position among sister cities in the old and new worlds. Thine holiday charms, the banners streaming from the house-top and the mast-head; the marches of patriotic citizen soldiers upon thy proud streets; the rush of well-dressed and handsome persons through thy midst; thine avenues, shading the passenger luxuriously from the genial sun, by thy majestic groves; the echoes of luscious music dying upon the ear; the pleasure steamboat, with its gay colors, and still more gay and light-hearted passengers, who are off to the sylvan heights of Florence, or to taste of the voluptuous scenery of Delaware's banks, immortalized and beloved for having borne across her bosom the faithful warriors of liberty; Newcastle rising to their eye from the western shore, and fair Wilmington, too, with its modest grandeur, retiring down yonder creek, shielding itself from the rude gaze, and yet contributing to the glory of Delaware's scenery.</p> 
                  <p>But to return. Gloucester, the hive of industry, the delicious village pedantly named city, with its loom and shuttle music; and how does the glorious Philadelphia look from this point? In solemn, quiet grandeur reposing upon the mighty river; no hovels, nor misery, appears to the view; nor strife, nor bustle, nor rush, nor shouting of voices, nor angry words greet our ear; but one immense line of roofs, of steeples, of masts and tree-tops, stretching far and wide; and as for noise, there is none-the city is, from the distance, a necropolis, as noiseless and motionless as a vast burial place. But once treading upon its docks, what angry looks, what anxious faces! how thousands rush to and fro. Whither are they going? whence have they come? Barrels are rolling in myriads on to a hundred vessels; goods in boxes and bales are piled up, now dragged down, then rolled along. Here a rush of porters; there horses dashing along, to the terror of squalling children and old age. Carts, omnibuses, coaches, are dashing about with affrighted<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5727-00000068"/> beasts and maddened Jehus. All is chaos, confusion, noise, bustle. What a change to thy far-off quiet look, and dead-like silence and inactivity. A ringing of bells; the roaring steam deafening the shouts of the bawling captain; the noise of wheels, and the din of commerce, make the sounds upon the ear almost amount to bewilderment. That is Market street; the depot of commerce, the mart of trade, the focus of enterprise. There is Chesnut street; the parade of beauty, the scene of fashion, and the abode of luxury. Yon is Walnut street; a land of lawyers, millionaires, idleness and woman. And each of these straight avenues, walled in by red brick, contains some feature of the Quaker City's glory or shame. These compact lanes, alleys and narrow streets, south of us, where houses are neither brick nor stone, but old and crazy, of rotting lumber made, are filled with the refuse of this civilized society; the ignorant, the pernicious, the lazy, the drunken and the refractory. North of us lies the neighborhood whereto our steps are now bent-S G. This majestic street, one of Philadelphia's broadest, is tenanted by the sinew of the city, its middle class; the storekeeper, the professional man, and the merchant; but all of second-rate power. This neat residence, with its pretty red brick, and tasteful green blinds, and white door, and marble steps, is the place where we shall rest the traveling reader-at the residence of Mr. Stephen Y. L-.</p> 
                  <p>The gentleman alluded to, sits in his easy chair, dandling upon his knee one of his children, a young and beautiful girl of not exceeding nine years, who crushes in her tiny hand his favorite newspaper, the <title>Pennsylvania Enquirer</title>, a privilege in the way of destruction not even extended to Mrs. L. Another girl, equally as beautiful, is teasing a small, barking lap-dog on the rug; and Mrs. L- is very industriously employed in hemming a pocket handkerchief, but occasionally directing the fond attention of the father to the babes' playing. He is a man of some forty summers, while the mother has not exceeded her thirty-fifth year. He is a tall, dark-complexioned man, tanned by Atlantic suns, vigorous in frame, and intellectual in appearance; while she is a light-complexioned woman, with auburn hair, blue eyes, full red cheeks, and rich ripe lips, with a rounded, matronly form, still portraying symmetry and grace in figure.</p> 
                  <p>It is not essential, in our brief work of editing these lives, that we should detail to our readers all the particulars of the studies, classes, and troubles of the youthful sisters, from their cradle upward; nor any elaborate exposition of the children's minds. Such a course would be tedious and unnecessary. Suffice it to say, that they were of about the same size, each having blue eyes and auburn hair. They were also, in all other respects, sisters and twins; and all that distinguished them was a slightly different expression about the mouth.</p> 
                  <p>We will now leave the children to their tuition and training, while we engage the reader with a brief synopsis of the lives of Mr. and Mrs. L-.</p> 
                  <p>Matilda Weston, now Mrs. L- was the daughter of a wealthy farmer, of Wilmington, in the state of Delaware. She became acquainted with her husband from meeting him at a party, at a friend's of their parents, he, at that time, being on a visit to that small and splendid city. He soon made proposals of love to Matilda, which were accepted, and they became man and wife. But over speculation in some mining operations reduced<pb n=""/> Mr. Weston, senior, to the lowest state of dependence; till at length we find him, not alone stripped of his estate, and incapable of contributing to the worldly comfort of his beloved daughter, but obliged to become a recipient of the bounty of his son-in-law, and a resident under their roof. This, with the old people's high notions of independence, did not end happily; for Mr Weston died shortly after, and his poor wife followed speedily. Mr. L- was a native of Scotland. He came to this country at an early age, and got a situation as errand boy in a stock-broking firm of Walnut street. Thence, through his acuteness, business tact, and fine education, obtained under the most inauspicious circumstances, he was elevated to a clerkship, and, at the time we find him, was a junior partner in the house. It was simply a business partnership; L-, entering without any capital, had to devote his labors for a mere moiety of the profits of the concern. Hence it was quite as much as L- could accomplish, to keep up appearances, in the eyes of the world, befitting his financiership. Not having received any assistance from home or foreign sources, his position was much to his credit, as an active, energetic, self-made man.</p> 
                  <p>The twin sisters, as they grew up, developed great beauty, combined with rare abilities, and became not alone the admiration of their parents, but a source of conversation and admiration to all persons of refined taste, who chanced to know them.</p> 
                  <p>The firm with which Mr. L- was connected, became embarrassed, and its affairs soon closed up, leaving Mr. Stephen L- burdened by debt, to commence battling once more with the hard circumstances of city life. His integrity and shrewdness soon won for him a situation of trust in another house of the same character. But this, of course, was a serious blow to the laudable ambition of leaving his daughters well provided for in his old age, or at his demise. But his misfortune came heavily upon him, and, notwithstanding the advice and retrenchments of his wife, it preyed sorely upon the man. Added to this, a fire broke out in his residence, and left L- in the world, without a home. This, with his previous troubles, and other embarrassments, led him, one morning, to the committal of suicide. Mrs. L- had gone down to breakfast, at the hotel where they were staying, leaving her husband in the act of shaving; when she returned to his bed-room she found him weltering in his blood, with his throat cut from ear to ear. For several days, the poor woman was crazed; but recovering herself, she removed from her expensive quarters, and took up her residence in the neighborhood of her first home in Philadelphia, occupying cheap and decent apartments. She was obliged to withdraw her daughters from school. They, by this time, were fifteen years of age, and certainly noble girls; either, in stature, was above the middle height, of erect form, carriage most queenly, and yet not verging into the pompous walk of pride. Their step was light and aerial, as they tripped along upon the prettiest, neatest, and yet plumpest little feet man ever delighted to look upon, or sculptor transferred to marble. Their busts were not yet fully developed into womanly fullness, but were most beautiful in their contour; their necks were sufficiently long, and from the poll curved in the most graceful manner till it formed the back; their shoulders shone with the gloss of semi-polished marble; their arms were round, plump, pale, soft, and curved into two most tiny wrists, and from thence their hands, so tender, with such<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5727-00000069"/> gracefully long fingers, that tapered off, and exhibited nails of filbert-like shape. Their faces were so much alike that it is quite impossible to make a distinction, for no difference existed. When they were together, it is true, Charlotte features were somewhat the larger, her eyes a trifle the bigger, and her form, mayhap, rounder; but divided from each other, it required the discriminating eye of one who was very familiar with the fair gazelles, to make a difference; and indeed, while at school, they were often taken for each other. The melody of their voices differed: not, indeed, that they were either harsh; but Charlotte's partook slightly of the contralto degree, while Helen's was a soprano. Their faces were of the oval shape, surmounted by a brow of dazzling paleness, developing some intellectuality, but not to that extent to make a strongly contrasted countenance. Their hair was so soft and rich, so light and undulating, as it hung around their beauteous temples, that it looked like locks of golden, rather than human hair. Their eyebrows were arched as with the accuracy of an artist's skill; and their eyes, so gentle, so expressive, like two mild orbs content to rest in their spheres, and revel in the rest that the golden fringes afforded them. Then their cheeks, so round, yet not fleshy; and upon these blushed two sweet pink roses; and their mouths, so small and prettily shaped, opening upon a row of brilliant, white, regular teeth; ears so pale, and when viewed from the profile, how transparent. Indeed, their whole physical being seemed to be a combination of nature's perfections. It looked as though they had been turned out of nature's studio, better conceived and executed works than any hitherto. We have done them injustice: <q>

                  <p>But no more of this. We must dispel angelic charms, "to pursue the even tenor of our way," among the features of our narrative.</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. L--, upon the death of her husband, or as near after it as she could command her energies, waited upon one of the principal tailoring establishments, and procured work as an embroideress, upon vest patterns. As her work was very superior to what they had been having, they gave her full scope to introduce new patterns, which her genius enabled her fully to perform; and thus she made from seven to eight dollars per week, while, as a worker upon other tailor's work, she could not have earned over four dollars a week, by the most intense labor. She then determined upon keeping Helen at home, to assist her in her few household duties, and learn her business at her hands; while the mother prudentially sought to give Charlotte another business, knowing that two of a family often disagree, when engaged in precisely the same business. How many brothers' love has this rivalry broken up? how many houses has it turned into a scene of contention? So Mrs. L-- soon found employment, as a fancy gaiter binder, for Charlotte.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <p>Mrs. L--, in a few months more, became reconciled to the loss of he husband, and her work steadily improved; while her daughters continued each to earn some four dollars weekly. Her situation, pecuniarily and mentally, was not so bad after all. Their earnings, for the three, at all times, equaled fifteen dollars weekly; and this, with the cautious hand of Mrs. L--, was made to contribute largely to a respectable position, and necessary comforts. So that the twin beauties were not destitute of the essential additions to good looks, in the way of superior attire; and there were few girls that dressed like the embroideress and the binder, to whom raiment lent so many charms, or, upon the other hand, who made dress so becoming. Their choice of style was marked by a fine eye for taste, elegance and neatness. While they desired to be fashionable, it was not their aim to outdo fashion; but they never selected anything for their wear, without a particular regard to its adaptability to their order of beauty. This made their dress all the more becoming; while other young ladies were spending much more money for clothing, they were making themselves ridiculously <foreign xml:lang="FRA">outre,</foreign> and robbed themselves of that dignity which should attend a woman of taste. Having said thus much, conceiving a useful lesson to be embodied therein, we shall proceed.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte's employer was a man of some thirty-six years, a fine-looking specimen of a gentleman; and, by his remarkable generosity, ingratiated himself into the graces of the young ladies who worked for him, and by this means, and his insinuating manners and polished address, succeeded in procuring the downfall of many beautiful and gentle girls, to satisfy his own depraved appetite. Charlotte, not being acquainted with the nefariousness of his designs upon her, drank in all the gentle, but well-directed flatteries he plied her with. His compliments were refined and even poetical, and his manner of applying them so fanciful, and regulated by the bonds of etiquette, that they could not fail to attract the admiration of a young, beautiful, and, of course, somewhat vain girl of sixteen. He gave her the best work to do, and would accompany that favor with another, of a superior price to what he paid the other hands; so that Charlotte soon was earning five, and occasionally six dollars weekly. He would often-accidentally, of course-meet her in various places, when he would pay her the most decided attention; till at length, they were upon terms of great intimacy, and Mr. Bellair, her employer, attended Charlotte in her evening walks, at church, at private concerts; and Bellair may be said to have introduced the young lady to "the world." At length he overcame, by dint of perseverance, her mamma's scruples against balls and theatres; and Miss L-- soon shone in the brilliant festive scene, at the feasts of Terpsichore and Thespis. Her graceful manners and winning ways told, with her beauty, in securing her many admirers; and flattery became pleasing to her ear, and her thoughts became dazzled with the brilliancy and pride of her own position.</p> 
                  <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5727-00000070"/> 
                  <p>Bellair had now been acquainted with Charlotte six months, and by this time she had assumed the manners of a most consummate coquette; she used her smiles for wiles, and her charms to attract the notice of young gentlemen. When first on the floor of a ball-room, she was frightened and dazzled, excited and exhilarated, transported and retiring. But now, instead of cleaving to the arm of Bellair, with the tenacity of a beautiful girl afraid of all around, she would leave him so soon as she could perceive another acquaintance whom she thought more available than her "chaperon." She could with complacency criticize the arrangements, and find flaws in that music which she once believed was more harmonious than any she had ever known. Her conversational powers improved, or, we should say, deteriorated; for she could talk sprightly things, appreciate good jokes, and beyond all her worldly accomplishments, she was a most excellent whist player, a splendid singer, a faultless waltzer, a perfect pianist, and a good player upon the guitar. All these contributed to her attractions, and brought the young men buzzing, like bees around a flower. She rewarded them equally, with smiles and tender looks, till Bellair felt himself almost sorry for having taken the trouble to introduce one who thought so little of him; or, at least, one whose affections he could not monopolize. But when they were alone, she bent upon him her soft looks of affectionate love, and Bellair forgot her faults. Indeed, we may say, that he retained more of Charlotte's attention than any other mortal; but her heart was divided among a hundred beaus.</p> 
                  <p>Helen, brought up at home, under the strict surveillance of her parent, was not so soon lost as Charlotte, and certainly displayed less of what the world calls force of character. One morning Charlotte returned from a ball, and had her sister locked in her arms, as she was recounting the adventures of the last rout, and of her triumphs there, first asking her sister's opinion of which young man she would most prefer, and then would follow an extatic description of all her favorites; then came names, and she would repeat off a whole list of names, asking her sister which she thought was romantic and pretty. Helen interrupted her sister, by asking her opinion how the name, Gerald Vernon, sounded.</p> 
                  <p>"O, charmingly!" said Charlotte; and raising herself above her sister, and reclining her splendid head upon her arm, continued she, "Why, do you know such a one?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do," said Helen, blushing deep carnation; "it's a pretty name, that's all," and she tried to draw her sister's attention off; but Charlotte remarked,</p> 
                  <p>"A lover, I guess, Helen."</p> 
                  <p>Her beautiful sister, finding herself cornered in her endeavor to conceal the name of Vernon, remarked,</p> 
                  <p>"Not exactly."</p> 
                  <p>But Charlotte was not to be thrown off so easily. She kissed her sister, and catching her luxurious locks, curled them around her taper fingers, and said,</p> 
                  <p>"Now, dear sister Helen, you do not use me well. I have told you all of my affairs; every secret of my inmost heart. I have reposed many secrets in your keeping, and have not asked even a pledge for their security; and you now have some little love affair which you keep like a<pb n=""/> suspicious little miser, safely locked up. O, it is too bad. At' least we ought to exchange civilities, or withhold them altogether."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, well, I believe you are right," said Helen; "but, Charlotte, I have kept my secret from you, not from any desire to keep you uninformed of my actions, but really because I felt you would laugh at me, and I almost entertain the same opinion now;" and she covered her blushing face with her hands.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, what's the matter with the girl?" said Charlotte, pulling her sister's hands from her face. "Don't you think I know you must have a husband, and, before that, lovers? Why, you are now seventeen years old, and it is not unusual for girls to get married at that age. So now, dear Helen, tell me all about it; how you became acquainted with your swain; what's the color of his hair; who he is; what he is; and what he looks like, and all the other information you can furnish. Come, be quick; I am dying with anxiety."</p> 
                  <p>"Now, don't you laugh," said Helen, looking into her sister's face, smilingly. "There, lay your head so;" and she took her sister's face, and turned it toward the wall, and then said-</p> 
                  <p>"Well; one night I was returning from: shop, and seeing some fountains play, amid some majestic trees, enclosed by a splendid iron railing, I thought, as the night was exceedingly warm, that it would be a delicious place to take a promenade in, previous to returning home; and as I saw several other ladies, and many gentlemen, seated and walking, it prompted me the more to join them; and I went in accordingly, and sat upon, one of the seats, and enjoyed the going down of the sun, the pleasant shade, and the music of the waters gushing from the fountains; and when I went near to the falling waters, and felt the cool spray dashing in my face, I was indeed happy. I saw a young man-O, so very handsome!-observing me. I felt that he was about talking to me. I was much afraid, so I hurried out of the enclosure, and looking up to the corner of the street, as I was emerging from the portal, at one of its four corners, I read the name-Washington Square. I then went home, and dared not turn round until I reached our steps, which I hurried up, knocked at the door, and as I, askance, cast my eyes, I beheld the figure of the young gentleman, who had followed me. I slept uncomfortable, lest he might visit the house, now that he knew where I resided. I went to the same place the very next night, as I had occasion to visit the shop at about the same time on the ensuing day; and there was the same gentleman, in precisely the same position, as upon the previous evening. I did not know what to make of it. I was filled with curiosity. I staid a short time, and returned; and as I approached the house, I turned round, and there was my relentless tracker at my back. Well, I did not go to shop for five days, and although this time elapsed, yet there I found my pursuer, ready to follow me home when next I went to the square. In three nights after, I went again, and the same scene was enacted over again. The next night, something occurred which gave a change to the matter. I had taken my seat opposite to the fountains; my gentlemanly pursuer was disposed of, I know not where, when, just as I was returning home, a man, in age, I should guess, about twenty-eight, with red hair saturated with grease, and a great fiery-looking beard, dressed very gaudily, was parading very pompously around the<pb n="152 (Illustration) -153" xml:id="VAC5727-00000071"/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> grounds, swinging a cane very swiftly. He seemed to me to be trying an experiment, of how near he could bring it to one's face, without absolutely striking you; and just as I turned round, he approached me, and lifting, in a most ridiculous manner, his white hat from his head, scraped a kind of how to me. I was lost in astonishment, and let down my veil to express my indignation at his salute. Finding himself foiled in his attempt to force an acquaintance upon me, he tried to complete his audacious effrontery, by saying, 'Why, Martha, you surely do not forget me.' I could see what this was intended for; to mislead the few spectators who had witnessed with pleasure the rebuff. 'Sir,' said I, almost crying, at being forced to hold direct converse with him, 'my name is not Martha, nor do I know you, never having seen you in my life before,' and was proceeding upon my return homeward, when he caught hold of my arm. 'Come,' said he, 'it's of no use; we 're old friends; what's the use of enacting scenes for the gaping multitude; let's shake hands, and be friends.' This was said with such an air of nonchalance, that I felt as though those who had been witnesses of the scene would believe him, and I lost all confidence in my ability to answer him with coolness, and I burst out into tears, and was fast relieving myself of my heart-rending vexation. At this moment, my mysterious pursuer suddenly emerged from somewhere, and said, in a rich manly voice, to the fellow-'Pray, sir, do you strive to insult this lady?' 'No, sir,' replied the rude fellow; 'she's an old flame of mine, and I don't want any of your interference.' 'Sir,' replied my defender, 'I tell you to begone; you are an impudent impostor; if not, I shall give you into the charge of the police; or perhaps,' said my welcome friend, 'I shall take the law into my own hands, and give you a sound thrashing.' Here the other grew mighty angry, and my friend whispered to me-'Leave this fellow to me; I pray you, make quick home.' I glided from the place, he following soon after; having disposed of my intruder by breaking his fancy cane into a thousand splinters, and dashing them in the red man's face, and quietly walking off, soon came up at the side of me; and I must confess, since I have confessed so much, that I did not walk home so quickly that night as hitherto. I thanked him for his gentlemanly conduct, and expressed myself under never-ending obligations for his manly vindication of myself in so marked a manner, and in so peculiar a contingency. He replied to me, that he was proud to have rendered me a service. He was sorry that it was under such disagreeable circumstances; lamented the occasion, and ended by felicitating himself upon having an introduction to me, one he had watched with so much attention. He then apologized for his rudeness, but excused himself in a most sensible manner; but what he said, I entirely forget. However, as he was a very splendid looking young man, I permitted him to walk home with me, and as he took my hand, and asked permission to see mamma, I felt compelled, through fear, to refuse him, but promised to meet him the next night; and then he repeated, in a melodious voice, Watson's lines: <q>

Of course, I dreamed about him; and when the next night came, although I emerged from my home conscious of having done wrong in not acquainting Ma with all that had occurred, I went forth with a heart beating quickly, and with certain emotions which it would be impossible for me to give expression to. He was there. We passed a pleasant evening together. In form, he is of the middle height, say five feet seven, to speak by rule. His hair is very black, very glossy, and very curly. The form of his face is oval; his complexion the most clear that you ever beheld on a man. His eyes are coal-black; his small, neatly trimmed whiskers are also black, and a healthy color blooms upon either cheek. His hands are small and well-shaped; and he is altogether a fine-looking young man. I should say his age is not exceeding twenty-one. And now I have given you a faint outline of my beaux; a young man to whom I am growing more and more attached, and whom I am going to meet this evening again. But, hark! here's Ma."</p>

                  <p>The beauties, in a few minutes, made their toilet, and each departed upon their separate daily avocations. It was plain that the seeds of consumption, engendered by over work, was fast reducing the vigorousness of Mrs. L--'s constitution.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <p>Bellair still continued his favors toward Charlotte; and, notwithstanding her coquetry and flirtation, she continued industriously at work. In fact, we might say, that she was more inclined to work than before she was introduced to society; for she found her expenses for dress increasing every day, and it required an extra exertion, even at her high wages, to keep pace with the increasing demands for wardrobe and jewelry. One day, Mr. Bellair, dressed in his usual careful and genteel manner, waited upon the gentle charlotte, and requested her to accompany him upon an excursion party to cape May.</p> 
                  <p>It was a beautiful day; the party was a large and respectable one, and the ride upon the majestic Delaware was most exhilarating and delicious. They remained over night, and had a ball in the meantime. We should mention, that, as Bellair sat beside the beauteous Charlotte, in a dark corner of the magnificent saloon of the Kennebec, he placed around her neck a beautifully wrought Indian gold chain, to which was attached a lady's beautiful watch, of most consummate skill and workmanship. She was eloquent in her praises of his munificence, and in expressions of admiration of his taste. As a return, she danced almost exclusively with him during the whole night; and kept her eyes more than usually fixed upon him. To keep the eyes of a coquette centred upon one man is a work of so much difficulty that we are constrained to mention to circumstance. She saw,<pb n=""/> We do not know how many Misters So-and-so, and So-and-so, that she knew, and was in the practice of flirting with, but whom to-night she scarcely noticed. The lights shone brilliantly in the crowded ball-room of the principal hotel, and Bellair, encouraged by Charlotte's preference for him, grew more and more familiar. She did not rebuke nor rebut him. The young lady felt overcome by the heat, and proposed a walk; so they left the magnificent scene of art for the more sublime work of nature, and rambled in the garden at the rear of the building. The flowers had gone to rest, and their beauties were not visible; but the moon, large and brilliant, and the gorgeous sky, reveling in mountain upon mountain of light ether clouds, was a study-a sight. Bellair conducted the splendid woman to the arbor, where she drank in, with almost stupor-like reverence, the honey of his words; till at last, after delivering a long rigmarole, he concluded by making her a base proposal; at which she started to her feet, and, cast her eyes staringly upon the base rascal, as if doubting what she had heard. He, of course, expected a storm, and commenced wheedling her in a maudlin manner. But this was not adapted to her present frame of mind. She wrenched the guard from her neck, and throwing the bauble watch upon the ground, stamped upon it with ferocity and madness.</p> 
                  <p>"You base scoundrel! leave my sight. You miscreant! you wretch! you worse than dog!" said she, straining her voice to an almost terrible height.</p> 
                  <p>"For God's sake, speak lower!" urged Bellair.</p> 
                  <p>"O, you ruffian! you wily wretch! begone, or I shall instantly have you put in the hands of the police."</p> 
                  <p>He entreated; but all Charlotte's answers were scorn. Then rushing upon her, he put his hands over her mouth; and after a brief but desperate struggle, he gave up his hopes of ruining Charlotte. She used invectives of the most desperate character, betraying passionate indignation of no mean order. Her rage was like the ocean; when calm, how placid, how gentle, how harmless, as on its broad and polished face, it reflects the beauty of the sun; but when troubled, how fearful, how desperate is it-a foaming, lashing, roaring, yawning gulph of death and destruction. The more Bellair entreated, horror-stricken at the tempest his vileness had raised, the more did Charlotte grow angry and violent, as thought after thought rushed upon her fevered brain, and recalled in more hideous characters the perfidy of Bellair's heart; till at length, overcome by her excitement, she gave one loud, long, and piercing shriek, and fell lifeless upon the sward. This brought persons but from the hotel; and coming to the point from whence they heard the female cry of agony proceed, they discovered Charlotte in hysterics, with Bellair vainly trying to restore her to sense and life. A doctor being among the visitors to the hotel, soon came, and, by his systematic mode of procedure, brought Charlotte back to reason and feeling. Her very first words, upon her recovery, were-</p> 
                  <p>"I desire to give this man, Bellair, into custody; he has used violence or the meanest character toward me," said Charlotte, coolly.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, the woman's mad," returned the astonished Bellair.</p> 
                  <p>She did not heed his remark; but seeing no one willing to arrest him, said-</p> 
                  <p>"Are there no gentlemen here, who will befriend a lady in distress, and<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5727-00000073"/> see that her desire to preserve her honor unsullied at the law's palladium, is fulfilled?"</p> 
                  <p>This appeal soon brought the spectators to a sense of duty, and Bellair was in the custody of a police officer in a few moments. Charlotte returned to Philadelphia; but how differently to her coming out. Her excursion of pleasure turned to a tour of woe. Bellair, who had come out a rich and respected man, returned a prisoner, a victim to his passions, and a shame in the eyes of the world.</p> 
                  <p>When Mrs. L-- heard her daughter's story of her insult, she commended her course, out mentally regretted her being thrown into the society of such persons. Although she would not communicate her own views upon the subject, from fear of annoying her daughter; yet she felt that her honor would have been better preserved, had she quietly left the villain, than in bringing her case into the open court of justice. This event added years to Mrs. L-'s consumption.</p> 
                  <p>At length, the case came on. The court was crowded even to suffocation; and many of the most fashionable of Philadelphia society were present, and seemed to hang with morbid interest upon the most disgusting features of the case. An able counsel was engaged for Bellair; and he, in his vile cross-examinations, hinted so much against Charlotte's character, as to leave the conviction in the spectators' minds that the prosecutrix was a depraved and vitiated woman; and when the young lady came from the stand where she had been giving her testimony, she found her mother and sister in tears, and she herself became so distressed, that she was borne from court in a fainting state. The court reviewed the case, and charged the jury so strongly against the prisoner, as left no doubt upon the jury's mind that the accused was guilty; and also demonstrated to the public that the bench looked upon the cross-examination as a foul slander upon the lady's character. Bellair was sentenced to one year's imprisonment; and thus ended the first important scene in which Charlotte had become an actress. Whether advantageous or not, the sequel will soon tell.</p> 
                  <p>This case became the subject of much moment, comment, and small talk. The newspapers dwelt upon it, with unctious love of exaggeration, and reveling in its most disgusting features. Charlotte's beauty became more notorious than ever; and when it was known that she had a sister, equally, if not more beautiful than herself, it turned the heads of all the fine looking men, youth, and dissipated roues of the city of brotherly love. And we know not how many plots were immediately set on foot to entrap the twin sisters.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <p>Now turn we to the career of our sweet Helen. Every night that transpired found her in the society of the young and noble-looking gentleman who had rendered her so marked a service. This, added to his appearance, his lovable ways, his intelligence, conversational tact, and general kindness,<pb n=""/> won the warm and tender heart of the young lady. Love soon grew out of their acquaintance, which seemed to be a mutual fire burning upon the altar of each other's heart. The only alloy to her great joy was the fact that her acquaintance with Vernon was conducted clandestinely to her mother. But still she dared not communicate to her the news of her love; and this gave her much distress, for she loved to make her mother's bosom the cabinet of her secrets. Gerald did not seek to be introduced to the young lady's parent, but kept on in the pleasant task of learning to woo her. And well and aptly did he learn it; for Helen's heart was deposited in his; and her whole aim was to convince and assure him of his entire possession of her love.</p> 
                  <p>We shall now speak of Gerald; we have already spoken of him, as a man of fine exterior, and of sterling capacities, we will now speak more distinctly of his worldly position. Gerald Vernon was the son of a wealthy senator in the western portion of the state, and resided at Harrisburg, the capital of the Keystone State, who desired that Gerald, who had just finished his education, should commence his studies in the office of a friend, a talented and highly reputable Philadelphia lawyer. Gerald was a good scholar, learned in modern and ancient languages, exhibited rare talents in historical lore, was a good mathematician, and not an indifferent poet, as the files of Harrisburg papers will testify; he was also a good musician, sang with taste, and danced very modestly, and possessed an inimitable share of small talk interspersed with choice quotations of the best ancient and modern authors. These qualities, handled with judiciousness, tended to elevate Gerald into a very lofty being in the mind of Helen. One night, (the very evening before that on which Charlotte had been insulted by Bellair, in the garden of the hotel at Cape May,) as Helen lay with her head resting upon the bosom of her lover, he was drinking in passion from her lips, as they sat in the front room of a Camden hotel, and the girl's heart beat high with love, and Gerald played most fantastic and soul stirring music that enraptured, exhilarated and entranced the fair Helen, and she became a victim to the wiles of the seducer. Helen soon after felt within herself the wrong she had done, but told no one of her fall, not even her sister. Gerald continued to pay her the same marked attention as usual, and she was compensated for her misfortune by his smiles; but as yet she had not awakened from her stupor of passionate love and blind devotion. The degradation, the shame, and the contumely had not yet demonstrated itself to her mind. She never calculated consequences-indeed she was ignorant of any, for she depended upon Gerald's eternal love and devotion. At about this time, Charlotte revealed to her mother and sister her insult, and intended destruction by Bellair; but while Helen was pleased to hear of the escape of her sister, she never stopped to compare her own situation, so wrapped up was she in a good opinion of her lover. How blind is love, how well does this expression suit those who are victims to the fascinating influence of passion. Here is one beautiful girl fallen-immeasurably, irretrievably lost, who could not see her own shame, but had a ready appreciation of her sister's less disagreeable situation. We often perceive faults in others what we think talents in ourselves. The trial caused considerable excitement among the small household, and scarcely any other subject absorbed the notice of Mrs. L-- and her beauteous daughters for several<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5727-00000074"/> days. This matter of Charlotte's produced a most melancholy effect upon the mind of her sensible mother; for several months the poor woman found no rest from the disgusting revelations which were made upon the day of trial, knowing as she did, what an effect such aspersions-whether grounded or not-would have upon her daughter's public character, she fretted more and more, until at last borne down beneath the weight of this trouble, she took to her chamber and remained very sick indeed for a few months. Mrs. L- had scarcely recovered from her last troubles, when another still more serious came to blast her comforts, her hopes and happiness; it was the news of Helen's advent to maternity.</p> 
                  <p>One night when poor Helen's situation became imminent, and she could no longer bear the suspense she had been thrown into, and when Vernon was no longer regular in his visits, nor warm in his attachments as before, the girl poured into the ear of her bedfellow and sister, a long tale of woe, of her fall and perilous situation. Charlotte was overwhelmed with surprise, at the destruction of one she had believed so unsullied and innocent. Notwithstanding Helen's remonstrances and protestations to the contrary, Charlotte communicated the whole matter to her mother, who was so overcome by the sad intelligence, that she once more returned to her couch of sickness, and now that her consumption had fairly settled upon her frame, she was no longer able to do her duty, and remained an invalid. Helen was soon an invalid also from less honorable causes. Charlotte's duties became onerous between the mother and sister's sickness.</p> 
                  <p>One morning poor Mrs. L- requested to see Helen's baby. The woman was a wreck, her full form had departed, the color from her cheeks had flown, the light of her eye was dead, and she was now a hard breathing coughing, sighing, debilitated candidate for a tomb. And when Charlotte showed her her sister's child, the affectionate mother dropped a hot tear upon her fevered face, and with her wan lips imprinted a feeble kiss upon the child of infamy, motioned Charlotte to her side, who uttered a prayer, and then fetched her invalid sister, who came just in time to kiss her poor mother's hand, and watch her lips as they moved to and fro-but her gasping breath would give no utterance. Charlotte and Helen knew it was a prayer, and they kneeled and prayed, and when they looked up again into their mother's face, they saw that she was a corpse.</p> 
                  <p>Oh what a sight was here! The death-bed scene is always truly awful. Woe to her or him who can look upon death with complacency. Such a calloused heart is not worth the having. But here there was more than usual bitterness in the cup of woe: not only was it the death of a mother, but it was the departure of the only prop that supported the girls in this world, and without which they felt they should be lost. And worst of all, oh dreadful thought! as one sister looked upon the other, either felt themselves guilty of this death. Their hearts beat with fear of having been a murderess, for they knew that their parent's death had been hastened by their own imprudence, if not their crime. Oh it was indeed a pitiable sight, there huddled together upon the floor, in tortures of woe, bathed in tears, in agony of the bitterest grief-prey to miserable dread-the two beautiful twin sisters. There upon the dead woman's breast sat the little babe, innocent of all around, adding its shrill pipe to the piercing cries of the prostrate daughters, little wotting of having earned a miserable title for his future<pb n=""/> life, viz. illegitimate. There it struggled unheeded, with "the helpless look of blooming infancy" upon him. <q>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
                  <p>The funeral obsequies of the excellent Mrs. L- were conducted with decency and due respect, and Charlotte and Helen appeared in mourning looking more lovely in these robes of regard to departed worth than in the fashionable colors of the time. They soon found that their united exertions were just competent to maintain them in their present style of living. We should mention, also, that Mr. Vernon now became a regular visiter to the house, and that the child was given out to nurse to a respectable German woman living in Manayunk. As soon as the season of grief was over, it was natural that the minds of the young ladies should now return to the arrangements of their worldly difficulties. Charlotte and Helen became more intimate than ever, and it was determined by them that some steps should be taken to redeem the honor of Helen by marriage or compensation. To this effect an interview was had between Vernon and the two young ladies, in which Helen submitted the arrangement of her affairs to her more worldly-minded sister. Since Helen became a mother, and from what her sister had told her of the course she suspected her lover was about to take, Helen no longer looked upon Vernon with that blind and implicit confidence that she had done, so that she was perfectly calm and collected in the matter and awaited the result with more stoicism than could be expected of her. Charlotte asked Mr. Vernon his intentions toward her sister in a manner so decided that he felt overwhelmed by the question. It was evident from his manner, that Vernon never suspected such consequences, but had rocked himself in the cradle of the hallucination of his great love, thinking that no notice would be taken of the matter after the death of Mrs. L- he thought that the storm had passed, but he soon found that what he had mistaken for it, were merely the dark and threatening clouds which pass over our heads and indicate the bursting out of the tempest with its pelting showers, forked lightnings, and cutting winds. Vernon, vain deluded man, in an embarrassed manner said that he had made up his mind to no particular course, indeed he had not thought any steps necessary. Although this was said in an innocent manner, yet it tallied so well with what Charlotte had told Helen, that the latter at once saw with redoubled force the necessity of coming to decided action in the<pb n="160-161 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000075"/> premises. The arbitratrix then asked the gentleman whether he was blind enough to think that after he had reduced the fair fame of a young lady, and made her charms subserve to his baser appetites, and that a child should be born as the result of such unlimited confidence in his honor, rather than as the results of any criminal desires upon the young lady's part, that she should submit to becoming a mark of infamy, and allow him to go forth unscathed and untouched to rob another home of its charms, to despoil another fair flower, to pluck it from its natal tree, to gloat over its hues and fragrance, and when his taste had been satiated with its beauties, to throw it aside to wither, and die, to be trampled under foot by the ruthless tread of the passer by. If he had so deluded himself with respect to her sister, she assured Mr. Vernon that he was miserably mistaken. He then declared that he had no such ideas, but the truth was that his love had come upon him like a thunder clap, he was not prepared for it, but having by accident become acquainted with the charming Helen, it was only to see her to love. Love and passion conspired in his bosom, and he fell a victim himself, For he swore before God that he never desired the name of seducer, but if any had told him that such he would be, before the dreadful circumstance had taken place, he would have branded that man as a liar. At the time that he became infatuated with Helen's beauty, he said he was, pecuniarily, unprepared to love, being only a student, without means; and he knew the temper of his parents too well, to suppose that his father would allow him at his early age to marry. He showed them clearly that his ruining of Helen was not a premeditated affair, that it was the result of love and passion of youthful heart; he showed to them also that he could not gain any thing by becoming a seducer; moreover that it would be ridiculous to force him to marriage now, because such an union would be one of misery, since he had not the first chance of supporting a wife-not even had he finished his studies; he suggested that as his father would make him heir to his splendid estate that they wait until the event of his demise.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte could not listen to this proposal. She remarked, that no matter how dearly Gerald loved Helen now, it did not follow that that love would not be replaced by some other at a future time. If not, it was scarcely likely that Gerald, on coming to a large estate, and into an elevated position, would proclaim himself to the public a seducer, by marrying the woman whom he had dishonored, and, furthermore, to father a son who would be a reproach and a shame to him. He protested; but Charlotte was not to be overcome. She desired him to write to his father, asking for a larger allowance, on the grounds that his present amount would not sustain him in that position which was essential to his lineage and pretensions. He did so; and his father answered by making some increase in his stipend, but not of sufficient amount to permit him to contribute largely to his child and Helen's support. Now, Charlotte, after this, felt that something must be done; and, having full permission from her sister, she determined upon seeing Mr. Vernon, senior. It was a long time before the affectionate Helen could be induced to sanction this step; but, as her sister urged, they were but poor seamstresses, as they were; and were they, because a man tried to crush them, to submit to his foot. "No!" said she. "We can elevate ourselves pecuniarily from this, which will be some solace for your troubles;<pb n=""/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5727-00000076"/> for then we shall no longer have to work the flesh off our fingers, and draw the eyes out from their sockets by night-light, for the mere sustenance of life. We can at least go into society; enjoy ourselves; and, who knows? instead of being workers here, we may elevate ourselves to a lofty and dignified position in society."</p> 
                  <p>Helen became less enamored of both Vernon and her position. Every day, more acutely did she feel the pain of her disgrace, and her shame was vivid before her; and being young, beautiful and captivating, she imbibed from her sister's glowing account, a love for fashionable life. Upon this, Charlotte started for Harrisburgh, and had an interview with Gerald's father. He was a very affable, kind old gentleman, and became much taken up with her manners; but when he heard the story, he was at first astonished, and seemed much distressed at his son's behavior; but afterward, he called in his wife, and narrated to her the circumstances. The poor lady was deeply affected. They gave Charlotte a splendid suit of apartments, and desired her to await the arrival of Gerald; to whom the honorable senator wrote a peremptory summons to return to his home by the next train. The young gentleman was astonished at this strange and sudden turn in his family affairs, and could not fathom the bottom of this matter. But guess his surprise, when arrived at the domain of his parent; instead of the happy emotional greeting he expected, he was received with marked coldness and indifference by his sire, and with tears and anguish by his usually fond and smiling mother. But this was not all; for, when he entered the drawing room, he saw, what at the first view he took to be Helen; but the experienced eye of the lover soon told him that it was Charlotte, and approaching her with all the calmness he could possess, he shook hands with her. He immediately fathomed the why and wherefore of this strange proceeding, and sat down with a very uneasy, unenviable set of feelings, to hear the worst. His father, in a business-like manner, and with more composure than could have been expected from him, related all, asking him for his reply. It was brief and manly. He confessed all; tried to palliate all, and begged his father to give his permission to his union with Miss Helen L--, of whom he spoke in the most generous, affectionate and loving terms. The father, determined to do nothing rashly, told Miss Charlotte that he would be prepared to give her his answer on the ensuing morning. That came, and with it his reply. He circumvented his decision with a fog of reasoning and logic; but the main points in the arguments were, that he had decided upon refusing permission for any union between the parties, for a thousand reasons, which we will not befog our readers with a repetition of; however, he determined to give her a compensation of five thousand dollars, which Charlotte, who pretended to work for a marriage, very graciously accepted, promising, upon the part of her sister, not to make any, further demand upon either Mr. Vernon, senior, or junior's estate, and promising to prevent, by all means in her power, the chances of Helen and Gerald's again meeting. Taking the money in large bills, and after many civilities, she took her departure, determined to spend with her sister a life of pleasure and gaiety. She returned to Philadelphia, embraced her sister, who was delighted at the success of her mission, and they slept in each other's arms, dreaming of the headlong career of gaiety and fashion it was their determination at once to plunge into.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
                  <p>As soon as the sisters could see a house, they commenced making arrangements for removal. They furnished their neat and elegant residence in a very modest and economical manner. It was situated at Kensington. Previous to making their outlays, they placed their money in the bank, in order to cause it to be noised abroad. Although neither of the sisters expected this small amount of money to attract a millionaire, yet they knew that men rather court women with some money, even if they do not require it, than poor beauties. This had the desired effect; and, of course, the fact of the Misses L- having furnished a splendid residence, and having five thousand dollars besides-for a story loses nothing in the charge of Mistress Gossip-they were soon objects of observation, and their great beauty filled the city with admiration. It will be remembered that Charlotte's appearing in a public court, though it added nothing to her laurels of virtue, contributed largely to her reputation as a beauty. They appeared at all the balls, and Charlotte's wit and coquetry surrounded her with numberless votaries; while Helen's debut in a more modest school, gave her a charm and a name among the more retiring. They were soon the recipients of invitations from the elite of the gay world; and brilliantly did the twin sisters shine in the splendid saloon, and at the card table. In order to be well thought of, they played cards for very high sums, and this, of course, attracted notice; but while it did so, it was fast reducing their deposit at the bank to a mere cypher. Among those who usually won was a young and splendid looking man named Frank Paton; and this first attracted the notice of Helen, for Frank's manners were pleasing to her, and it was only natural that she should watch, closely and intently, the actions of a man of whom she had become somewhat enamoured, and who paid her the most delicate attentions. Helen asked him the secret of his success, and he at once disclosed it in perfect confidence. He said he had commenced his career with a fortune of ten thousand dollars, and before he was twenty-two years old, he was not worth a cent; he had lost it at the gaming table. He afterward tried to follow an honest employment; but the infatuation for gambling had taken so fast a hold upon him, that he could not shake it off, notwithstanding that he used the most strenuous efforts to wean himself from all play; till, one night, he perceived some unusual shuffling of the cards by a player, and he at once saw that there was more in gambling than bringing money to the table. He then made experiment after experiment with the cards, until he could do almost what he pleased with them, and from that time his success had been marked; he had never lost a cent<pb n="164 (Illustration) -165" xml:id="VAC5727-00000077"/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> To show her what he meant, he first pulled from his pocket a couple of sets of dice and boxes, which he said he always carried about him. He further said that, on going into a room, if backgammon or dice should be played, he would use his own dice, which, he demonstrated to her, were loaded, so that they always dropped down with the lightest figures upon the face; that is, they would roll out in such a way that they would count very lightly. "Now, when I have to play, I use the regular dice, but, as you are aware, it is the privilege of the opposite player to put the dice in the box; I then throw in my dice, which I conceal in the palm of my hand, or in the sleeve of my coat, or in my pantaloons pocket, and perform this trick the same as the magicians and wizards do their's. I can, in two cases out of three, beat them, you see; for I roll with the regular dice, which very seldom count less than seven, while it is almost impossible for mine to roll so high. This is so perfect an arrangement that no one would suspect it; for instance, when people doubt others about cheating, they examine the cards or dice the suspected persons use; but you see, it would little avail them in my case, for I make them cheat themselves; the instruments they use are the spurious ones, and I use the honest implements. I never but once was suspected, and that by a fellow from New York city, and I insisted immediately upon having the dice examined, when it was <choice>
                        <sic>cleary</sic>
                        <corr>clearly</corr>
                     </choice> demonstrated to the uninitiated, that he had used the false dice, and I the honest ones. He was immediately beaten by the gentlemen in the room, and kicked out, while I was looked upon as a martyrized gentleman. Thus much for the dice." Then going over another of his pockets, he pulled out a very heavily chased silver cigar case. "Probably you will not take a cigar," said Frank, smilingly; then he proceeded. "Now, if I should get taken into custody by some of the marshal's emissaries, they would not be able to tell that this magnificent cigar case is neither more nor less than a card case. You observe that that silk lining, which looks as though it went to the bottom of the case, is shaded dark around the edges, to produce the effect of depth; the cigars are very flat, and ones that I never smoke; there is a false bottom to this;" and then Frank turned it over upon the palm of his hand, and then a lid sprang open, where the bottom should have been; and here lay, snugly concealed, a pack of very clean and fine cards. "Now these cards, said he, may be all known by their backs; these are what are called marble cards. You will observe that there is a line runs peculiarly at each corner, but all different, but so slightly that no one would perceive the difference; but I know every card of importance by its back, and can tell what kind of hand my adversary holds; This, of course, is an illimitable advantage. But further, by being dexterous in shuffling, I can deal myself or partner just what kind I please. I generally manage to give my opponents a good hand, if we have got a great start in the game, and allow them to go ahead somewhat; but making sure to pick them up when the time comes for winning." He then illustrated some tricks, in which Helen, at the request of Frank, would ask for just such cards as she wanted, and he would deal them out with the dexterity of an old player, and without any apparent fraud. She was surprised. He said that the way he managed to get his cards introduced was, by becoming acquainted with some one on the boat, in whose hands he would place the deck, so that, when cards are called for, these useful articles are<pb n="166-167 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000078"/> produced according to arrangement, which, he remarked, was a ten dollar perquisite for the person. "Or if I am in a room-and gamblers are generally very cautious about procuring a new deck of cards, whenever they are about to play-I put a poor looking boy there, whom they generally select to go for a new deck. He pretends not to know me, nor I him; but all the time he has my cards in his pocket. I use a great many decks in the course of the year; and we-that is to say, myself and a few others-keep a man engaged in making them. He gets sixteen dollars a pack for them, and makes some fifty or sixty dollars regularly per week."</p> 
                  <p>Helen was much astonished and delighted with this information, as she saw vividly that, with Paton's help, they might soon make an immense amount of money between the three. She communicated the whole to Charlotte, before whom Frank effected numberless tricks, which further convinced Charlotte of his being a master in the art. Before the night was out, the two young ladies understood the theory of shuffling cards; and before a fortnight was over, they could "make the cards speak," as Paton termed it. The intermediate time was spent in luxury and gaiety; and Charlotte and Helen made many acquaintances among the roues, and many conquests among the confiding jackanapes who abound, and believe that every woman whose course they cross, is in love with them.</p> 
                  <p>We will close this chapter by introducing an occurrence which intervened, and caused no inconsiderable excitement in the city of brotherly love. At a ball given for the benefit of a military company, Helen became acquainted with a citizen soldier of great wealth and high repute, and he frequently visited at the house of the twin sisters, and with whom Charlotte contracted an acquaintance of a disreputable character. But Mr. Merton did not contribute so largely to her support as she expected; indeed, it was an affair of disgrace which she had entered into with an idea of its turning out profitable. So it was arranged that Frank, who was the constant companion of Helen, and the two sisters, should administer a sleeping draught in some wine, which should be partaken of by Merton exclusively, and then his pocket book was to be extracted. A splendid supper was arranged and laid out, and combined all the luxuries of the season. The wine was passed around, and being some choice Curacoa and Chateaux Marjorex, delighted and tickled Merton's epicurean desires; but in a few minutes more, the worthy gentleman was so overcome that it was found necessary to send home the stupified man in a conveyance. In the morning, when he awoke, he missed his wallet, and feeling confident that he had left it at the young ladies', he immediately set off in search of the lost article, which was valuable for its contents. He found the three at breakfast, of which they invited him to <choice>
                        <sic>prrtake</sic>
                        <corr>partake</corr>
                     </choice>. He did so, but was surprised to hear nothing about his lost property; he, however, thought it was merely a joke, and when they all denied having seen it, he merely laughed; but Frank asked him if he was in earnest in supposing that they would be guilty of robbery. Merton replied, that having been the worse for liquor upon the previous evening, he thought it quite possible that, as his friends, they might have extracted it from his pocket, with the idea of returning it to him when he should next call. Charlotte was sorry for his loss, or pretended to be so, but was very much surprised at Merton's conduct. He at the same time began to feel more and more convinced of his not being any where else on<pb n=""/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5727-00000079"/> the previous evening, and the fact of his so soon becoming oblivious and stupefied by a very small share of wine, occurred to him; and being jaded on by some insulting remarks of Paton's, he called Frank a blackleg and a thief. The latter challenged Merton to fight, and before he could say a word, or take a step, the former, in an excited manner, pulled from his pocket a pistol, and taking deliberate aim at his victim, notwithstanding the entreaties, cries and shrieks of the young ladies, shot Merton through the heart, who fell dead in a pool of his own warm blood. The house was instantly broken into; the police secured Frank with the weapon in his hand, and he was dragged off to prison to await his trial.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <p>It was only by a mere chance that Charlotte and Helen escaped being indicted for the same offense with Paton; however, they were necessary to the evidence; and certainly the public did not hold the young ladies altogether guiltless of the matter. By an ingenious train of argument upon the part of Frank Paton's counsel, it was demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that Merton had tried to stab Frank, and that the pistol had been used by him in self-defence. Certain it is, that when Merton fell a knife was found in his hand; but he had made no effort, up to the time of his being shot, to stab Paton, His sentence was five years imprisonment.</p> 
                  <p>Bellair, who, it will be remembered, offered insult to Charlotte, at Cape May, had been long since released from his short imprisonment, and had remained silent some years; but, as the dust of prison wore off him, all his brazen effrontery, varnished by a liberal education, once more manifested itself; and, wincing under the sting inflicted by what he termed the scorpionism of Charlotte L--, was bent upon revenge. One day he chanced to meet her at the corner of Chesnut and Seventh streets, when he deliberately asked her, "How she prospered with the dead man's money?" This vulgar allusion to her supposed participation in the Merton tragedy, enraged Charlotte to a great extent, seeing that she was thus meanly as sailed on the principal thoroughfare of Philadelphia, before gaping hundreds. He promised her that he would meet her repeatedly, and repeat the same offense. The proud, haughty, and revengeful Charlotte was not to be used after this manner; so, placing herself near his place of business, a couple of days after the transaction, Bellair soon espied her, and accosted her in the same vulgar terms as before; but Charlotte, all prepared, drew from beneath the ample folds of her cloak, a rawhide, with which she belabored Bellair until he took to his feet, and was glad to escape. This pleased the spectators, and gratified her; but she knew that those repeated exposures, and coming in vulgar contact with the masses, would not add to her reputation. So they, the twin sisters, determined to travel west and packed up, and left their native city, never to return to it.</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>They spent a considerable time in the smoky region of Pittsburgh, where their beauty rendered them attractive. Captains of the western boats, and southern gentlemen, were introduced to them; and among their frequently newly formed acquaintance, were not a few who loved gaming; and upon these occasions, they used to advantage the tricks with the cards, that the unfortunate Frank Paton had taught them. They were generally flush of money.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte, taking up a, Tennessee paper one day, read an account of a union, or marriage, between Mr. Gerald Vernon and Miss Paumier, of Knoxville, Tennessee, extolling, in glowing colors, the young lady's virtue and the gentleman's probity; stating, furthermore, that the couple would take up their residence at the Oliphant Farm, a beautiful property not far from Knoxville. Helen, upon reading the paragraph, was aroused to a great excitement. The old passion she had long since entertained, revived in her bosom, and once more she felt the wrong of her youth very acutely; but at this time, not to become the lover of Vernon, but rather desired to enjoy the pleasure of being revenged upon him. It became a day thought and night dream with her. "Why," thought she, "should I be branded as a perfidious woman, and he, who made me so, pass current with the world as a virtuous man." No! she swore inwardly, that she would be revenged of this man; that she would haunt him night and day! No! that she would teaze and annoy him; and end by exposing his shame, and making known his early career. O, what a terrible mind was hers! stern and bloody, resolute and unrelenting!</p> 
                  <p>She told her sister that she was going to leave for Tennessee. Charlotte said she would accompany her sister wherever she went, and through every trouble and emergency; but advised her merely to make it a means for raising funds. To this Helen at once assented; but in her heart there was buried the thirst for Vernon's life. Helen sent for her boy-that illegitimate child, who was now, for the first time in his life, to see the face of his father. Arrived at Knoxville, they staid in most splendid apartments in the hotel there; and, of course, two young and beautiful women, as they were, became the immediate subject of village clatter.</p> 
                  <p>The honeymoon of Gerald and his bride was not yet over, when, walking by the window of the hotel, he saw a female face; like a flash of lightning, Helen's former face came to his mind, and he rushed to the instantaneous conclusion that it was she; but much changed from her virginal innocence to the bold beauty of the woman of the world. He turned deadly pale, and exclaimed, "Great God! can it be!" which alarmed the young and beautiful woman who hung, with much endearment, upon the arm of her husband. She asked him what was the matter; and it was with the utmost persuasion that she became convinced it was a mere spasm which had seized Vernon.</p> 
                  <p>At evening, when the sun had gone down, and Vernon was sitting in one of the commodious window sills, admiring the slowly approaching dark clouds which were to make up night, with his bride beside him, listening to his remarks with an avidity which bespake both her love and enjoyment. The windows and doors were all wide open, as if to invite the poor and needy, and those stray gusts of wind, which waft about at even time, in a warm climate like that of Tennessee, which gives health and salubrity to the hot, dry summers.</p> 
                  <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5727-00000080"/> 
                  <p>The house of Mr. Vernon was one of those large, commodious dwellings that characterize the south and west. Built, unlike our northern city residences, where every room is a kind of secret drawer in a writing desk, and requires an ingenious mind to find them out. No; this was a house very large in all its parts. Its tall was large enough for a residence; its drawing room was almost as capacious as the senate chamber of a state legislature. Its grounds were extensive, and certainly well laid out; while its front exhibited an utter disregard for the economy of lumber; for there was a wooden balcony, huge, wide and long, four immense pillars supporting a gigantic pediment head or Corinthian cornice, which, if chopped up, would have supplied a poor family with fuel for no inconsiderable time. The house had been newly furnished throughout, and newly painted entire, which spoke most audibly of a new possessor; and this was Mr. Gerald Vernon's abode at Knoxville, Tennessee.</p> 
                  <p>As we have before said, his wife was living upon the honey of her husband's lips, when two ladies, with a youth, entered. Gerald first, in courtesy, rises; but as his eye rests upon the paragon of beauty, Helen, he almost sinks with astonishment and despair. He tries to announce them by name to his wife, but the words cleave to the roof of his mouth; at length he stammers out-</p> 
                  <p>"Pray, be seated, ladies;" and Mrs. Vernon rises and places chairs for the three personages just entered, when Helen says-</p> 
                  <p>"There, Horace, go and embrace your father."</p> 
                  <p>Vernon shudders, his wife wonders, and the boy says-</p> 
                  <p>"So, that's my papa, of whom you have spoken so much."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, child; don't you see how glad he is to see you?" said Helen, with remarkable self-possession. "Go, embrace him."</p> 
                  <p>And then the child ran toward his father; but the latter merely extended his hand, and, with the other, hid the gushing and heart-ending tears which were oozing from his eyes. Mrs. Vernon, not being able to understand or fathom all this, arose from her chair, and said, with great earnestness,</p> 
                  <p>"I pray you, explain all this mystery."</p> 
                  <p>"T is easily explained," answered Helen. "Yon crouching thing to whom you have been allied, is a base seducer. He has seduced me; and that poor innocent boy, who now clings to his hand, is the result of his base villainy;" and as she repeated word after word, her voice arose with a fervency of passion not often exhibited in Helen.</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Vernon, almost frantic, fell upon a sofa, merely uttering the words, "No, no, no! it is not truth! I cannot believe you!"</p> 
                  <p>"I would have a word with you, sir," said Helen to Vernon.</p> 
                  <p>He stood up beside her, covering his confused face with his hands, when Helen drew, from beneath her dress, a poignard, and ran it into the heart of Vernon, who merely shouted, "I am murdered," and fell, scrambling to the chair from whence he had just arisen, Mrs. Vernon uttered a loud shriek, on seeing her husband fall, and had her hand upon the bell-pull. Helen rushed towards her, and like an infuriated beast of prey, stabbed the woman in several places. Charlotte stood horror-stricken and petrified. She had not expected her sister's vengeance to take such a bloody course. Then Helen fell heavily upon her face, amid the heavy death-groans of her two victims. Charlotte rushed toward her sister, and tried to arouse her to<pb n=""/> a sense of their mutual danger, and endeavor to induce her to fly the scene of this bloody and wholesale murder. At this time there came in a posse of men, who had heard the screams from the road, and who soon secured the sisters, while the unfortunate couple were carried to couches, and attended by competent surgeons. But, alas! the murderess' steel had entered too deeply into their hearts, and they soon died.</p> 
                  <p>This bloody and sanguinary deed caused the greatest excitement among the citizens, and no sooner was it known than around the country it flew, with the swiftness which always attends bad news. Never did occasion bring out more undisguised wrath. Had it not been for the stern inflexibility of the officers of the commonwealth, summary punishment would have been wreaked upon the young and beautiful, but alas, base women.</p> 
                  <p>The day at length came for the trial; and, after a long, painful, patient and careful examination, the, two beauties were found guilty. Helen protested her sister's innocence of the crime; but the jury had no evidence in coming to any other conclusion but that she was guilty, and they were both sentenced to undergo the extreme penalty of the law on the 20th of August. They were removed accordingly to jail, and Helen immediately commenced the editing of a statement of the affair, with a brief memoir of her life, hoping thereby to save her sister from the executioner's hand; but when it was delivered into the hands of the judge, and he refused to take any action in the matter, she had no more hope. Charlotte had concealed some poison in the lining of her dress; the day before the execution came, she partook of it, and when her door was opened, she was discovered in the cell, a black and distorted corpse. Helen, on a bright and clear morning, was led forth to the scaffold, and ended her eventful career by being strangled before the gaze of many. A yell broke from the mass. She protested her innocence to the time of the rope being adjusted, prayed, and in another moment she was swinging in the air, a vibrating corpse. The spectators slowly moved away from the revolting spectacle, let us hope, better persons. And, in conclusion, we trust, that those who rise from this book, will bear before their minds the career and; fatal termination of Helen and Charlotte L--, the Twin Sisters of Philadelphia.</p>

               <head>THE ROBBERS.</head> 
               <p>The discovery of gold in California has given a change to the affairs of the whole world. Since the first yield of the precious metal to Mr. Sutter, the race of mankind has been unsteady and transitory. While a new state has become settled, we might say, the rest of the universe has been unsettled. The eye of man has become gorged with visions of wealth, and stories of streams running with precious gold, and of mountains whose height is the almighty metal. All these illusions have aroused the latent spirit of enterprise in the unfortunate; has given scope to the vicious cravings of depraved hearts, and rein to the unbridled lusts of the dissipated. It has opened fields of enterprise, and revealed to us forests of vice. California gold has subverted religion, and made for us thieves instead of believers. Its highways, while they are choked with poor, honest, industrious men, seeking that which, in more Northern latitudes, they have never had, or, perhaps, have lost; fathers seeking dowers for their children, and a competence for old age; husbands pining for their wives, but hoping soon to carry back to their beloved ones, the only remaining link in the chain of happiness unconnected, and that is money; the young man who, desirous of procuring a name or a fortune, also clogs the thoroughfare; there is, lurking in the train, men whose life is alcohol, whose happiness is gaming, whose religion is money, and whose social comforts are to be found in nothing save in their own notions of them. Gold and crime have been synonymous terms since the discovery of the mines. It has brought into the world more scoundrels, more accomplished ruffianism, than whole ages could have otherwise organized.</p> 
               <p>Though the history of these pages is not immediately connected with California, yet the men whose doings we are about to narrate, operated on the highway to the gold regions, and lived upon the unwary traveler, or the boxed up earnings of thousands, passing, as they hoped, to their Expectant friends. But, alas! what must have been their feelings on both sides? of him in Oregon more acute, who has labored in fear of life, early and late, with relentless trouble, grasping, and at length, by the force of his energy, plucking out of the bowels of the earth, his first instalment to his friends at home. O, how most painful to those who are waiting the arrival of every steamship with anxiety, and learn, by letter, of gold to come; then, to hear of robbery and tales of loss. Yet even so it is; plunder is the order of the day. We should hope that in a land where the precious ore is to be gained by working for it, that few men would desire to gain the goal by a<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5727-00000082"/> shorter route. Let us opine that this is dying out. When the ploughshare is used; when the busy wheel of the mill shall foam and ripple the gushing creek; when the sledge hammer shall be wielded by the adventurer; when the loom and shuttle shall play; then shall the frightful deeds which have been committed in the name of civilization and commerce, be scarce in the historian's lore. As these are transpiring, so is crime being hunted out of existence. Let us hope that American enterprise, which has dispatched the Indian to the west, and made his vast hunting ground into a garden, will blot out of existence the labyrinth of iniquity which has so quickly grown up in that newest of new worlds-California. On the Isthmus of Panama existed, and probably now exists, in some shape, a desperate and rapacious set of men, combining their united strength for plunder, and even murder, if necessary to the accomplishment of their base and foul designs. Their name is <q>
                     <p>THE ROBBERS.</p>
                  </q> Their scene of labor is in the mountains which the passenger crosses to reach the city of Panama. Every tree might tell a tale of robbery; every nook and cranny have been hiding places for ill-gotten store; and the waters of its rivulets have been, crimsoned with the blood of butchered victims.</p> 
               <p>You have heard, reader, of mining associations, and gold washing associations and companies organized for the opening of huge gambling houses, and palaces of vice of another character; but as yet, with all the writings which have deluged the reading public upon the mighty Eldorado before your eye, with letter upon letter. Which have added to your knowledge, you probably have not heard of associations of thieves, robbers and assassins. Depravity is so low, and the gain so high, that men have actually left the olden countries to become members of banditti. Highway robbery on the isthmus, is as romantic and chivalrous an affair as we read of in Spanish and Italian novels; but the former are, in truth, known, while, for the latter, we have only to rely upon the inaccuracy of romancists for our information. The Derienni comprised intellect, perseverance, daring and unanimity, worthy of a better cause. Its deeds we shall bring to light; its more prominent crimes will be found in, these pages. Regardless of consequences, but mindful of truth, shall we push our work through to the last.</p> 
               <p>The public of Panama city has done its duty, in sending into the interior a band of honest men, to risk their lives in the summary punishment of the Derienni. Their labors were attended with partial success; they have scotched the snake, but not killed it. The monster Derienni shows its head now, sometimes, and when the stakes are ample, is not backward in making war upon life and property; and too often do we hear of a traveler murdered for the few grains of gold in his possession; and a mail train is occasionally attacked, and slaughter may transpire. We give the lives of the three men shot by citizens; they were hardened and depraved ruffians, but had been innocent once; and that remark contains a moral to the thinking mind, which may be of service at a future time. We do not pander to any morbid taste; but hope, by the exhibition of vice in its nudity and its undistorted state, to cause the young man to avoid the embrace of crime, and follow the path of honesty, perseverance and virtue, the only true road to wealth and peace.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">A CONVERSATION-THE CABIN AND ITS OCCUPANTS-THE DEAD MAN-THE ATTACK AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</head> 
                  <p>"Well, Hank," said a brawny-looking fellow, putting his feet upon the only table that served the apartment, "that express man fought like a wild fellow."</p> 
                  <p>"He did so," answered another man, similarly dressed, and of about the same age as the last. "Easing that train was a darned tough job, warn't it?" and up went the speaker's feet upon the other side, and, with an air of nonchalance, he stowed away a big quid of tobacco behind his cheek.</p> 
                  <p>"I would n't like to run the risk of another muss like that; great risks and small profits, Hank;" and the latter, in a most easy manner set to whittling the logs of the cabin, against which he was sidewise reclining.</p> 
                  <p>"Joe, boy," said his companion, "I tell you there haint such bad profits upon that haul. It was a $13, 000 trade, and that aint bad. No, sir!" said he, in an emphatic manner.</p> 
                  <p>"Well now, you divide that between fifteen fellows, and it haint worth the risk of losing your breath for," answered his companion.</p> 
                  <p>"Not so bad, old fellow, when we take into consideration the other work we've done lately." Then, changing his manner, "I wonder how that other expedition is going to succeed. It comes off to-night!"</p> 
                  <p>"Well," said his friend, "the boys are going to have a tough time of it. Them fellers are desperate chaps, and haint going to knock under without a struggle; but as our boys are well mounted, and have good nags under 'em, I don't fear the consequences," he continued hopefully.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish, Hank, they had let us gone off with 'em. I hate this mounting guard. It's a slow business-d--d slow!" and the man seemed to grow restless and uncomfortable.</p> 
                  <p>"O, well, these things must be done; so it's no use worrying. Let's take a nap;" and, bounding from the table, the man threw himself upon a matting.</p> 
                  <p>"Agreed," said his friend, following suit, drawing his bed across the door way, which he closed. In another minute the two men were fast asleep.</p> 
                  <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5727-00000083"/> 
                  <p>The scene was decidedly picturesque, though not comfortable. The interior of a log hut, which was no more than a barrier against the inclemency of the weather, being rude and ungarnished by wall furniture. A few weapons hung around the interior. Powder flasks, scabbards, cigars, bottles, knives, and revolvers, were carelessly thrown upon rude shelving; while garments and Panama hats hung around in profusion. A dim oil lamp was suspended from the roof; and huge trunks, with ponderous locks, served as seats. Opposite to the door at which one man was sleeping, was another door, which opened upon a smaller hut or cabin, in which, it was plain, the culinary or cooking affairs were carried on; for there, huddled up in a corner, with his immense chin hanging on his breast, lay a fat negro, who was sleeping with his arms locked around his knee, and snoring aloud.</p> 
                  <p>This cabin was the temporary residence of the terrible "Derienni." It was situated in a deep ravine, by a curious and intricate side of a mountain. It was not observable from the muddy, stony and difficult road, as it was secluded by the hanging boughs of many trees. Not even from the highest hill could you perceive anything of it, even in day time, more than a streak of smoke struggling through the leaves, to mingle with the skies above.</p> 
                  <p>The two men who were sleeping in the cabin, though of the same profession-either brave, dauntless and sanguinary-were of different build. Hank, as his friend called him, was named Harry Ryer, a large, athletic, powerful man, with a frame displaying energy and elasticity, and a face tanned by Southern sun, rendered still more dark by black, shaggy eyebrows, and hair of the darkest dye, growing over his lips and chin, and bristling all over his face, that left but a small matter of cheek, and his eyes, and a narrow strip of forehead unhaired. He had on one of those flexible felt hats, with a broad supple brim, which lend such a look of chivalrous daring to the Spanish. He wore a light green coat, most fantastically ornamented with bright buttons. A big belt and buckle girdled his waist, and gave a symmetry to the hugeness of his form. His pantaloons were dark, and rolled up over a pair of ferocious Wellingtons; and there he lay, in the slumber of powerful and vigorous health, with a blanket thrown carelessly over him, and a straw bed, with a stained covering, beneath him. The other man was not over five feet five in height, of light frame, but so encumbered with clothing that he looked a much more desperate customer than he would if he had been dressed as a fashionable New Yorker. His hair was of a reddish turn, and hung in profusion, and though his eyes were blue, and his complexion delicate, yet he looked like a man who had done some service, and could do it again. They had been taking a long nap, when suddenly the tramp of heavy feet was heard outside; then came a tremendous lunge at the cabin door, which brought Hank to his feet, as nimble as possible; and Joe was awake, but the old cook still slept on.</p> 
                  <p>"Hold on, boys, a minute, till I move the bed," and Hank, with the rapidity of lightning, hurled the bed from the threshold, and four men entered, carrying a wounded body, and two others followed, bearing a box, small and almost square, made out of very heavy lumber; in short, a "specie box."</p> 
                  <p>None of the men spoke a word, but looked sad and heavy enough, as they deposited the dying man upon a matting, which Joe rapidly spread upon the chest, and then, taking off their hats, they wiped the perspiration from<pb n=""/> their brows. The two fellows, putting down the specie, and just relieving themselves of a few encumbering articles they carried about them, went out again for the purpose of taking charge, and stalling their nags for the night. The remaining four, emptying their pockets, and pulling off their coats, formed a picturesque group, with their red and blue flannel shirts, their different attitudes of sympathy over the man, illuminated by the heavy light of their old lamp.</p> 
                  <p>"Here's a bad job," said Hank; "can anything be done?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing," replied Mathew, or Mat, and boss, as he was sometimes called; and another remarked, in a brief manner, "He's a goner;" and a third, in a husky voice, "Shot three times about the heart;" while a fourth was staunching the blood of his expiring companion upon his knee, with an immense bundle of rags. It was, after all, a pleasant sight to behold these men. How affectionately did they tend their friend! Not a word escaped them about the booty. Their minds were absorbed in his very look; and every wry face that the poor fellow made was rewarded and answered by an eloquent look of compassion from his fagged and rough companions; till at last his head fell heavily upon the man's arm who bore it; his eyes were open and garish, but Dan Decker was a dead man.</p> 
                  <p>For a few minutes after this, there was a dead silence. Not a word was uttered, till Mat said, "Boys, let's to bed. We'll bury the poor fellow tomorrow evening."</p> 
                  <p>The time of undressing was speedy; and, in a few minutes more, the other two returned from the stables, and the eight men retired to rest, in a manner that bespake their grief most emphatically. Not a sound escaped them. Rest soon came, to their eyelids, and there reigned in the cabin a silence as profound as its tenant-death.</p> 
                  <p>These men, all members of the Derienni, set forward that night to rob a small band of merchants who were returning from the golden regions to their mother States, with the rich rewards of their industry with them. The band of Isthmus pirates had been advertised of their coming, by a member of the body in Sacramento city; but he only told of there being three in number, so that the Derienni thought six would effect the business easily; and that being their number without the two who were always left at home, they did not think it worth while to ask assistance from their friends at Chagres, Panama or Gorgona, at either of which places they had formidable fellows, in all numbering thirty men, inclusive of their own strength. As night approached, Mat, who commanded, was standing upon an eminence, when he perceived, through his spy-glass, a train approaching, and communicated to the boys that he could plainly discern seven men with it. They felt a little surprise, but knew no fear of success. Mat, then gathering them, he asked whether they would chance it, or let the train pass; when Dan Decker said, springing up from the sward, "Boys, haint six of us enough for any seven? Shall the Derienni come down so soon. No! let's do our work like men." The six then determined upon standing the hazard of the die, and a loading of arms, and a preparation for an attack commenced, with that promptitude and method so peculiar to this band. The men were fixed: two, Mat and another, on one side of the road, at a bend, were to attack the party on the right, and Decker and another were located on the opposite side, while two, with rifle pieces, were to attack the<pb n="178 (Illustration) -179" xml:id="VAC5727-00000084"/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> party in the rear. The procession came at length, slowly and tediously dragging along, when Mat shouted "Fire," and the four men took aim and fired with a rapidity and precision that would have done honor to the most experienced disciplined soldiers. When the smoke cleared away, the unwary travelers had scarcely recovered from their surprise, and had just time to perceive that one of their number had fallen from his mule, and that he was mortally wounded, when the roar of guns was heard in the rear, and, in another minute, the six men, determined upon making their visit good, flew from their hiding places, and attacked the travelers with the utmost ferocity and daring. Each party being well armed, the struggle continued for a few minutes with great heat, when Dan Decker fell from the shot of a revolver, from the hands of one of the travelers. This incited and excited the Derienni, and they fought with demon-like ferocity. Cut, slash and fire was the order of the time till they hewed down the man who was riding upon the mule laden with the box of specie. One of the pirates, drawing the mule away, secured it to a tree, and then returned to the scene of action, to fight it out. The five remaining travelers put their boots to the mules' sides, and succeeded in making their escape, while the poor native guide, and one of the merchants, were left to mark the scene of a desperate and bloody conflict. In a few minutes, the mangled corpses were washing down the rapids, and four of the party had Decker on their shoulders, and were carrying him home to their cabin; two following, leading the horses, and carrying the money box.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE BURIAL-THE STORY TELLING ARRANGEMENT-LIFE OF MAT, THE BOSS.</head> 
                  <p>Gus. Randall and Rob. Bowler, two members of the Derienni, set to work early in the morning, digging a grave for their deceased companion. It was a custom with this, band that their men should be buried in a decent manner, or as near to decency as they could approach. They cleared a spot-a kind of jungle-and beneath this was the dead carcass laid. There was no mummery of prayers, for none were there who felt competent to the task of uttering them; nor were any chaunts uttered, nor disgraceful lines repeated, as has been often the case with organized bands of ruffians; but it was a calm, quiet, serious affair. The night was beautiful and moonlit, and no idea could be had of the natural romance of such a scene. The sentiment of the occasion was indeed beautiful. When the men returned to the cabin, they sat for a few minutes, some reading novels or old letters, others smoking cigars, till Mat called upon "Uncle," or Unc., as it was sometimes abbreviated, for a bottle of brandy, and some glasses, with which the old colored man came in, rocking from side to side like a narrow-beamed ship in a hurricane, and, waddling to the table, put down all that was required.</p> 
                  <p>"Some sugar, Unc," said Joe</p> 
                  <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5727-00000085"/> 
                  <p>"Hi, hi," replied the old man, in a very seaman-like manner, and the men, throwing off their previous gloom, prepared for a carousal.</p> 
                  <p>"Boys," said Mat, rising to his feet, "we have lost a good friend, a good pal, and a good worker for the Derienni. Dan Decker was the second man who joined this enterprise. I was the first, and I say it with pride, who organized this conspiracy, with little hopes of its reaching its present powerful and influential position. Now, I am not going to make a long speech; but I want you to understand that the laws of the Derienni require us to pay due respect to a brother chip who chances to be croaked while in the order. We have paid him that, and we should be unmanning ourselves if we continued to be low-spirited on his account. Let us hope that Dan is better off. He may go to worms, or to the devil, or to God; but I believe such a good fellow can only go to heaven. Now, gentlemen, I have nearly done. Our business is to drink to his memory, and then drown the subject in a bowl and song, and proceed with our calling like true men. Here's" said Mat, lifting a heavy glass filled with brandy to his lips, "here's to the memory of Dan Decker," and the fellows, rising to their feet, knocked the bottoms of their tumblers on the table, and then, raising them to their lips, drank off the contents, with the name "Dan Decker." Down they sat again, and Joe, who was considered the best singer, led off with the splendid song of "Paul Clifford," which his manly voice and natural dignity did ample justice to, and it was loudly applauded. Then followed Rob. Bowler with the song "Whisky in the Jar;" but when Mat was called upon, which, of course, was a compliment, for he seldom sung, save in a chorus, he said, in his usual coarse manner, "Lads, I'm no singer, and you know it. I generally tell you a yarn, which you accept as an apology, but to-night I am going to give my life. I am an old salt, and have many yarns stowed away up here," and he pointed to his head. "As this is an extraordinary 'casion, I shall tell you my history. I shall give you my life, as near as I can recollect it, from the first day Mat knew what he was, and a little afore." The boys seemed pleased with the arrangement, and, upon Mat's invitation, each man took another tug at the brandy bottle; and then came a terrible bustle in the way of cigar lighting, throwing away old soldier's, and putting in their mouths new ones, and placing their feet in a very elevated and comfortable position. Mat was a kind o' righting himself, and taking another small horn. He asked the boys-"All aboard?" They replied-"All aboard;" and Mat commenced:</p> 
                  <p>"Well, here's</p>

                     <head>"THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF MAT ROWLEY, THE BOSS DERIENNI.</head> 
                     <p>"Well, you all know that I am a regular full-blooded Yankee. I was born in the town of New Bedford. My father was a Cape Cod fisherman afore me, and, of course, it was very natural I should be a fisherman arter him. Well, I am now-I am. Let me see," and the old man looked up to the oil lamp, for the purpose of jogging his memory. "Yes; I'm nothin' short o' fifty-two years old, boys. Well, the old man died early; much afore he'd oughter, and left me, a boy of nineteen years old, to bring up my two young sisters, and attend to my mother. Well, I worked hard.<pb n=""/> I tell you. I fished later in the season, an' earlier too, than other men; and many a frozen finger and toe have I had off them Newfoundland banks. Howsomever, I was nothin' daunted, and my mother was as happy as her lone situation would allow her to be. She was a pooty woman, boys, and my sisters was two sweet looking critters as a man looked at. One was named Isabella, and the other they called Laura. Two spry names, warn't they?" and the boys nodded assent. "Well, nothin' particler happened, and all went along to hum as slick as needs be, when one day I returned to our pleasant cottage, and who should I find there but a fellow as they called Hiram Garnett. I thought that he'd come to borrow a net or line, or summut for boat gear. So I set myself down, an' axed Hiram, 'What's new?' and he seemed quite bamboozled, and in a kind o' fizzle, and said, 'Nothin' new.' He then got up, and walked his carcass away. When he was gone, I made bold to ax mother what Hiram wanted. She was astonished and bewildered, and I felt more anxious to learn what Hiram wanted, 'cos he never came to our house afore. Well, she kind o' baulked. But I warn't to be beat slowly, so I swore by G-- she must tell me directly. Well, she shuddered as I swore, for it was the first time I ever took an oath in her presence. She said 'No good would come of my swearing,' and then she up'd and told me how Hiram made love to her, and wanted her to consent to marry him. And then she burst into tears. I felt kind o' bad, and my blood warmed; and although I was then only a young un, I determined upon being even with Hiram for his insult to my lone mother. So, one day, a few of us boys were talking on shore, while repairing our canvass, about a big haul we'd made, and this Hiram interfered with us, and doubted something I said. Well, as the saying is, one word brought up another, and I told him he had insulted my mother. He doggedly replied, 'My mother warn't no better than she should be.' Upon which I rose up from my sitting, and, drawing off with all my might, I struck Hiram upon the temple, a heavy blow with my marlinspike, that shattered his head, brought him reeling to the ground, and in a few minutes Garnett was dead. All the fellers were taken aback, and set to carrying off the body, and I made my escape to the road, and cut along, and for several days wandered through the country like a stray dog. I had neither appetite nor rest. I could not work. I was like a mad feller, until one day I arrived in Boston. Here the immense population, and the strong wall of houses made me feel safe from the pursuers' vigilance, and finding a vessel bound for Liverpool, I engaged with the skipper as an apprentice, and, after a run of fifty-one days, which, afore these ocean steamers or Baltimore clippers had brought the old soil within a fortnight's voyage of us, was considered very fast work. Although I liked the sea, I left my ship, and was determined to scrape up an acquaintance with Master Johnny Bull. Well, I was only a lad, and I got kind o' home-sick, and felt as how I'd like to see mother; and yet I was scared to go home; and every thing I eat went agin me. I longed for buckwheat cakes and molasses. I liked hard cider better than their bully ale; and I tell you I felt as though I must die without some codfish, cooked as the old woman knew how. I was working at a warehouse on the dock, and was mocked by the men, who grinned at my Yankee greenness; but they were all pooty good-natured fellers, and I did n't mind it at all. They soon made me their acquaintance<pb n="182-183 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000086"/> and one of them introduced me to what he called 'life.' I fretted so much after my mother, and I could not return to her, that I found a solace for my misery in drink. I very often returned to my bed a drunken fool. Then, of course, I had not the experience in liquor I have now.</p> 
                     <p>"Well, I soon got out of work, and I found it bard to get into a berth again; so I removed to the neighborhood of Primrose Hill. Here I soon found a companion, in a woman named Sal Magnus. She earned enough 'tin,' as she called it, for the pair, and I became a fancy man. Sal was not a common prostitute, but what they call a picking-up woman in those parts. She would hail a fellow, keep him in tow for a few minutes, and end her interview by easing the fellow of his purse, his pocket handkerchief, or anything else she could grab. She was pretty generally successful, so we had lots of money and lots of fun. Gin made me forget my home, and prosperity hardened me to deeds of desperate character However, my gal was nabbed one night, and got seven years transportation. Her defence took all the money we had collected together, which was about forty pounds, and I was left in the world, without a character and without the means of employment. So I then turned what they cal 'sneak.' I used to write a neat letter. (I larned to write when I was East.) I'd then walk out and knock at some rich man's door, deliver the letter to the lackey or servant gal, he or she, whichever it might be, 'ud then take the letter to their master, as they call bosses there, and I'd bolt off with all the loose overcoats and trifles that was hanging in the hall, while the boss was reading my note, and the servant was waiting for an answer. I was very successful for six months. I could, average in my earnings, about five dollars a day; but I was overhauled, and they sent me to the Lancaster jail for a year.</p> 
                     <p>"I served my time, and made the best of my way towards Manchester. Let me see, it was about forty miles. I walked very hard, and did it in a day. I arrived very much fatigued, so I went straightway to Dan Galligan's, a brother to the man who bought my stolen goods of me in Liverpool. He knew me, having once seen me to his brother's. He kept what they call there a clothes shop, down a cellar in Swan street. He behaved very good to me, and introduced me to a number of thieves who operated in different ways; also, to a very fine looking woman, named Mary Bowers. She was a tall, splendid craft, and was dressed A. No. 1. Dan said that it was a special favor this introduction to Mrs. Bowers, for she was considered not alone one of the handsomest and showiest women out, but she was one of the best workers in the town. By this he meant she was an accomplished and ingenious female thief. Mary was a woman of good breeding and education, and used to play the lady in good style. She had never been an inmate of a brothel, nor did she bargain away her charms for gold. I was simply a business partner; and although I passed as her husband, it was a long time before, in private, she would allow me to approach her familiarly. Galligan provided me with dress; and although he had plenty of superior second-hand clothing, which even respectable men wear in the old country, still he persisted in my having my clothes made to order. He then put in my pocket a splendid gold watch and chain, and in my breast a magnificent 'prop,' or diamond pin. Mrs. Bowers and myself started on our mission. We were to stay at hotels in large cities, and 'operate' upon<pb n=""/>

                        <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5727-00000087"/> plate at table. We carried on our game, managing to do a large business; and when this failed, we planted 'bogus bills' on to the house. Our magnificent dress arrested all suspicion; and good dress and lots of baggage will take an old country hotel keeper off his guard, for traveling is not so general as in the States. We traveled in this way for two years, and sent all the proceeds to Dan. He used to keep an account-debtor and creditor-and pretended to work for a small percentage; but that was all gas. He made the rocks, while we ran the risk of being sent to Van Dieman's Land. I recollect the last bit of business that Mary and I transacted together was the following: But boys," said Mat, "let's liquor. I find this yarn is too long a one; so, if you'll let me off, I'll own up the corn, that I've begun what I can't keep through." They all persisted in his going on with the history, taking advantage of the pause to have a drink. "Well, Dan gave us a one hundred pound bank of England note, about five hundred dollars. He put us on what is called 'a plank,' and, providing Mary and myself with a splendid horse and open carriage, we took a ride round. Mary was to go a shopping; women buy the groceries there mostly. So, drawing up to the principal establishment in St. Ann's Square, in Manchester, kept by a very rich Quaker, Mary Bowers, escorted by a very perlite young man, walked into this tea and sugar palace, for such it was in reality. They had big plates of glass; and I stood at the door, watching the spanking horse I had there, and eyeing the gorgeous harness and the magnificent shay with pride and satisfaction, when one of the porters passed me and requested to know where he should stow away the bundle of groceries. I told him to stow it away mid-way; but as he was a land-shark, I had to stow away the cargo myself, 'cos he did not understand me. This done, I returned to the store, and Mary feigned sickness. She had not paid for the stuff-it was all arranged,-and when she got upon the bottom step of the door-way-for their shops go up a step or two-she fell, or stumbled against an immense pane of glass, and shattered it into a thousand pieces. She, of course, fainted away, and was led back again. The shop was in an immense flutter. I was, of course, extremely busy, very much excited and distressed. But at length I cooled down, when I saw Mary show symptoms of recovery. I was frantic with joy, and the shopman, or clerk, seemed to show symptoms of great contempt for my extraordinary love, when suddenly my Lucretia's eyes opened, according to agreement, and she asked 'Where she were?' and 'Where was her dear Horatio?' that was me, and a great deal more slang of the same sort; when I got her into the chaise, and all was in order for a start, though Lucretia, poor thing, was very weakly, and all the smelling salts were as nothin' to her nose, I had the ribbons in my hand, when the old Quaker came up, with a polished crown, and rubbing his hands as though he were using sea water and soap. Says he, very timidly, 'I beg pardon, sir, but you have not settled for your groceries, nor the pane of glass.' 'Botheration,' said I, in a fluster, 'you talk of being a member of the society of Friends, and yet, while my good lady is perhaps dying, you are following me up for a few paltry shillings.' With all the English pomposity I could scare up, I said this. He said, 'Those windows cost thirty pounds a piece. I will bear one half, and thee the other, and that, with your lady's purchase-five pounds two and sixpence-will be twenty pounds two and sixpence.<pb n=""/> Here Lucretia gave a groan, and requested me to drive on; but I requested her to be calm a while, and then we would drive home. I pulled out my hundred pound note, and contemptuously threw it towards the Quaker, he glanced at it in a hurried manner, rushed to the desk, and gave me my change-seventy-nine pounds seventeen and sixpence; in all, about four hundred dollars, so we did not do a bad job. Dan got a hundred dollars, and Mary and I divided the rest between us. We then parted. She had very little cash, but a wonderful stock of jewelry, worth in all over eight thousand dollars; while I had but a few pounds left. Dan gave me a pile of notes, and hired a colored rascal to serve me as valet. He had been a fiddler at dances. I was to travel as a rich American slaveholder, all over the continent of Europe. I paid my hotels in large bank bills of a bogus kind, and received good currency into the bargain, and gambled largely. I did not do any tricks with the cards, but confined myself to the bogus business. I did not care much whether I lost or gained; but when I gained, I kept the good money, and losing, I paid my debts in bogus; so it was a pretty sure business after all. Sam, the colored chap I had with me, was a lazy, dull, impudent fellow, and scarcely minded what I had to say. He threatened me, upon my promising to discharge him, to give me up to the police. This was at Florence, in Italy. So, not feeling safe, I made the best of my way back to Paris, when I gave him his wages. I became reckless of what he could do; but he informed upon me, and the commissary of police very politely tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me for my passport, which I immediately showed to him. He pocketed it, and requested me to follow him. I was soon in the presence of a magistrate, charged, as I learned, with being a notorious swindler and passer of bad money. My accuser was my discharged servant, who had no proof against me, and therefore they had no power to detain me. I spent money profusely among the gensd'armerie, and presented the captain of police, who took me on to the court, an X, which I slipped into his hand on the way. I was soon discharged from custody. I returned to my lodgings on the Rue de Richelieu; and about three months afterwards, a man requested to see me. It was my colored miscreant. He was in rags, and very poor. He had fallen away in size wonderfully, and looked for all the world like a feller as had been fed upon gunny bags for a few months. I was so enraged that I rushed towards him, and gave him a sound lashing. Well, I kind o' felt for him arter, and gave him five dollars; but I insisted on seeing him lay it out for a fiddle. He went to work to fiddling, and soon earned a good living. He was very thankful.</p> 
                     <p>"After going over the continent again, right up into Poland, Turkey and Russia, I returned to Liverpool, after an absence of five years. Here Galligan hardly knew me. I then took to betting on races, and, as I had a pile, I found little difficulty in making heaps of gold at that fun. I used to see plenty of pleasure, and lived in this way for about five more years, in great style; mixing with high and low, and leading a merry time, with lots of money at all times. I felt an anxiety to hear how my mother came on in the world. I found an American sailor-a young fellow, who was born in the town of New Bedford. I met him accidentally, at a shipping office. He told me of my mother's death, and that both my sisters were married to honest fellers. I began to believe that my mother's prophecy,<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5727-00000088"/> that no good would come of my swearing, was about fulfilled. I then thought it would be best for me to return to the States; and, going back into the sea-faring business, I got employment as boatswain for a large line-of-packet ship. On the voyage, nothing particular happened, save that I got into a row with the first mate about the provisions, struck him, and was carried into New York in irons. I was discharged before the alderman; so, for fear of being recognized as the murderer of Hiram Garnett, I took ship for New Orleans, where, with the money I had left, I became part owner and commander of a clipper built schooner, as sweet a craft as ever spread canvass. I was commissioned to go to the coast of Africa, and bring away negroes, and land them at the port of Cardenas. My vessel was well manned and well equipped, and we made some very profitable voyages. We were sometimes chased; once hotly by a big British ship, which sailed fast for her tonnage; but our broad canvass, and immense speed, made light of her shot. I had only one near approach to death. We were overhauled by a Yankee brig off Cuba. They boarded us, and them Yankee boys meeting us Yankees, it was a hard show. They fought for the constitution, while we fought for our lives. We ultimately cut them down, and made mince-meat of them. We killed three, wounded four, six jumped overboard and were drowned, and we made prisoners of the remainder of the crew, seven in number. They all turned out jolly good fellows; and, as we lost ten of our men by ship fever soon after, and the rest were sick, the fresh supply of men proved not only a boon, but our salvation. In that affair I was fortunately saved by the timely defense of a chap as they called David Breck. Well, I carried on the slave trade for about six years. It was a profitable game; and when I left off, and sold the craft at Norfolk, in Virginia, I had not less than, twelve thousand dollars, I then went to gambling. I played a foolish game, and much as I knew of the tricks of the table, I was seized with a desire for play. There's no accountin' for this taste, for most men know that the chances are against 'em. I played on for six months, and was left without a cent; and although I now commenced to play upon no capital, I found I could make a living at that at which I had lost a fortune. I one night was playing, for I was at the table eighteen months in all, and rose without a cent in my pocket. I returned heavily towards home; when, suddenly, thought I-Fred Pownell, the banker, would return with his wife towards home. They lived out in the country. I waited for them, under the shade of a tree; when, suddenly, they came to the spot where I was standing. I emerged from it. 'Fred,' said I, 'I do n't want to harm you, but I must have some money. You and your party have had my pile, and I am determined to have some of it back.' He protested against giving a cent; his wife remonstrated. 'By heavens, I am not going to be fooled. Now, Fred,' says I, 'are you going to stump up a few thousands; you've got plenty.' He was about answering by <choice>

She defied me; and stealthily using her husband's dagger, stabbed me slightly in the arm. Still, I would not wound her; but, taking my handkerchief from my pocket, I bound it over her eyes, and tied her up to the hedge, so that she could give no alarm, nor could she tell whither I had flown. I made the best use of my legs until I reached<pb n=""/> a snip ready to make sail for Charleston. I stowed myself amidships without being seen. Having waited a day or two, she loosed her moorings; and as I had lots of money, of which I had just possessed myself, wherewith to pay my passage, I found the best of accommodation.</p> 
                     <p>"After a pleasant trip of about seven weeks, we made Port Lavaca, in Texas, I stayed in that country for about three years, following one business and another; and at one time was engaged as a leader of a volunteer company to defend American interests, and Texas particularly, against the Mexican desperadoes on the Rio Grande. I went to California arter that, with some Galveston fellers, when the gold fever broke out. There I kept a drinking saloon, and was connected in business with a regular Tartar-a Spanish woman, named Christiano Marino. She was not satisfied with taking a man's money, and leaving him penniless, but was very fond of stabbing. Now, I did n't like this eternal cutting and slashing; so I cut her and escaped to this part of the world, where, for a long time, single-handed, I carried on all the business on this Isthmus; and then I formed the Derienni. And then, boys, you know the rest."</p> 
                     <p>"Now, lads," said Mat, "let's liquor and go to roost."</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE GRENADIANS-THE DERIENNI-THE ATTACK-THE DROWNING MAN-THE RETURN HOME.</head> 
                  <p>In these pages, we have not dwelt at length upon the many monstrosities and crimes of the bloody and sanguinary Derienni. Because, in feasts of blood we do not love to gorge our readers. It is an unwholesome food; one that hardens the mind, and makes callous the heart to the spilling of blood. Beyond a doubt, it has been ascertained that such is the result; for in some countries, and in several states of this Union, have the people gone so far as to abolish death punishments, believing that, instead of changing or deterring men from cruel murder, it merely produces and engenders an indifference to the spectacle of death. We say that we have not detailed their numerous crimes upon the unwary traveler, but one scene we cannot help recapitulating. The afternoon had far progressed towards its successor-night. The immense sun was pouring down its lava-like streams upon the isthmus from an almost purple face. The sky was tinged with fiery hues, and nature seemed scorching beneath the scathing heat of this all powerful sun. Three haggard and weary travelers were urging with cudgels and feet their unwilling and fagged mules along, whose tongues hung from their mouths, and, ever and anon, would stop and try to find water. But little progress was made in this way; their coats were hidden beneath the white foam of relentless perspiration, and the travelers, suddenly coming beneath the grateful shade of a huge tree, they halted, and got down from their pommels. These men were New Grenadians, who were crossing the Isthmus with some gold belonging to their government, They then<pb n="188 (Illustration) -189" xml:id="VAC5727-00000089"/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> observed the dust of riders coming toward them, and they thought, although with no expectation of relief from the travelers, that they would await in the shade their approach. Those whom they saw were the Derienni, upon a scouring expedition. These had observed the travelers resting, and made immediately toward them. Their mules having been but recently brought from the barn, they were comparatively fresh arid vigorous. After a long and tedious patience, the Grenadians saw the new-comers alight, and found, to their chagrin, that they could only speak an occasional word of the native language. This provoked the Derienni, who wanted to learn the cause of their travel; but there were not many ceremonies, for the ruthless robbery approached the saddle-bags of the mules, and commenced turning over the contents. When one of them saw a large red seal upon an official, diplomatic kind of paper, they, the Derienni, made up their minds that the strange travelers were agents for their government. The surprised travelers pulled off the man who had taken such an unwarrantable liberty, but were soon roughly handled, beaten and tied up for their pains, while the Derienni quietly removed the saddle-bags from their mules to the backs of their own. The Grenadians shouted and grimaced, but all in vain; the robbers merely laughing at the curious faces they made. "Well" said Mat, "having got so far, it's of no use going any further without caution. Let's make up our reckoning, and ascertain where we are, throwing himself upon the ground. The other pirates followed the example, and they held a consultation upon the sward.</p> 
                  <p>"Well," said Mat, "now that we have determined that these ere fellers be government officers, it won't do, boys, to let em go, for their government will send a number of men down upon us, and they will overpower us. Then we shall taste a rope dance afore we want to do, that's all; so, let's steer clear of breakers."</p> 
                  <p>"Well," said Hank, "the only way is to put an end to there being any clue to them," and out came his tobacco box.</p> 
                  <p>"You mean, to kill 'em," said Mat.</p> 
                  <p>"I do," replied he, coolly.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, that's my opinion," said the boss.</p> 
                  <p>The others concurred in this view, and the pirates arose from their seats with determination marked upon their brows. Mat gave orders to one of their band to lead home their newly-acquired mules and saddle-bags. The rest proceeded to untie one of their victims from his stake. He made a desperate resistance, but it was in vain. The five brigands tied his hands and feet, and then putting the disabled man upon the back of a mule, one leading the beast, others held steady the victim, until they reached the banks of the river, and then hurled the man into the gushing creek. They turned not an eye to perceive what became of the poor wretch they had so mercilessly murdered, but proceeded back to repeat the crime upon a second, then upon a third victim. This being all got through, they mounted the mules, and left the victims without remorse, pity or sense, a prey to the rapids. One of the poor fellows, the second one, had not been confined about the feet, like the first and last. The rope was certainly coiled, but the knot was not a secure one; and when the man was in the water, being an expert swimmer, he lay upon his back on the water, and managed to kick about with his legs until he reached the opposite bank, after much<pb n="190 (Illustration) -191" xml:id="VAC5727-00000090"/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> battling with the current. Here he lay exhausted for several hours, with his arms tied. He tried to raise himself, but unsuccessfully, until he dragged himself against the trunk of a tree. He managed to raise his body up by a slow and tortuous process. This was a work of no mean labor, and the big sweat drops stood upon his brow; he was almost exhausted. He walked slowly, however, and, almost dead with exertion and fatigue, he arrived in Panama, where his story was told, and a committee of public safety was the next day organized, for the purpose of putting down these miscreants. The best men lent their aid to the design, and there was great rejoicing when the mass learned that the people were going to take the law into their own hands, and execute that which their courts failed to touch. We are no friends to lynch law; it robs the accused of every right of defense; but, we ask, will any man doubt the wisdom of such a tribunal, where no other is calculated to be productive of the like results, In a state, city or village where the law can be administered, there is no necessity for the lynching system-it becomes in itself a curse; but in a case like this, there can be no doubt of its justness and fitness.</p> 
                  <p>The Derienni kept out that evening till the skies darkened. They traveled many, many miles in search of new victims. Not a word escaped them, as they rode along side by side, of pity for the poor wretches they had hurried into a premature grave. On, on they rode; story after story was told; halt after halt was made; observations taken, and nothing else appeared to attract their ferocity and rapine; so, jaded and haggard, care worn and tired, they retired to their cabin, and soon were buried in the deepest and profoundest sleep. Who shall say whether such brutish men had dreams at all? If they did, what spectres must have they seen? what misery must have been theirs. Rest to them seems unnatural; for dreams, horrid hallucinations, black phantasies, and dreaming tortures should be reserved only to plague the solitary moments of such terrible beasts. And this is no tale, but a simple record of facts, which are undeniably true.</p>

                  <p>The next morning, Pete Dunham was perched in a high place, on the look-out. The boughs of some splendid trees kept the sun from melting his burly frame, and spying three specks in the distance, he kept his glass upon them, until they had increased into a train of three mules. A shrill whistle made his friends aware of the lucky discovery of a good chance for pillage. They were soon equipped, and in about half an hour were near the spot where Pete was holding his watch. A few stray steps of a dance, a song or two, a drop of brandy, and whittling, managed to keep the party in amusement and glee, until the arrival of the fresh victims.</p> 
                  <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5727-00000091"/> 
                  <p>"Hold on," shouted Mat. "Bout ship!" as the three mules were carrying the listless travelers along. The travelers seemed taken by a paralysis, so surprised were they, when the Derienni coolly marched up to the ex-Californians. Mat then said, "We're very sorry to trouble you, gentlemen-very sorry; but the fact is, you've got a small commodity which we're very much in need on, and that is gold. We expect toll here, at this 'ere point; and as there are no justices at hand here, we're obliged to collect our dues by main force, gentlemen."</p> 
                  <p>At length, out spoke the old man, who was the father of his companions:</p> 
                  <p>"If you wish the few grains of gold I have, I will give it you without a murmur; but, gentlemen, I am a poor old man of broken fortunes. These young men you see with me, are my two young sons. I have been in business in Eastern Pennsylvania, where I failed, and we came out here to redeem our fortunes. I mean to re-establish my character. I have just a few dollars over what will pay my creditors. For God's sake, spare me, gentlemen; if you take from me these few grains, I shall die of a broken heart, and those who had confidence in my character will curse me in my grave. Rather kill me, and let my sons go home with the money, that they may redeem their father's name. I have a family at home, whose honor I wish to redeem; and in old age have I commenced a new life in a new country; and just as I am returning to make peace with my Maker, and die happy, I am met by you. You are all men; you have good hearts, and you would not rob a poor old man, who is willing to sacrifice his life, but not his honor," and the old man burst into tears. The young men plead in similar terms. The old man cried and entreated, and the robbers, after consulting together, determined to let the old man go. It was an awful moment of suspense for him; but right conquered, and the three pursued their course, while the old man delivered an audible prayer for the salvation of these desperate, yet noble men.</p> 
                  <p>That night the men were more joyous than usual, and over their cups they laughed and joked with light hearts and great glee. Every anecdote was received with laughter; every joke told twice well, when Hank said:</p> 
                  <p>"I have a proposition to make. I was very much amused and gratified at our boss's story of his life; and I would be glad if we should make it a rule that each man should tell his story. Each life to occupy a night."</p> 
                  <p>"Agreed, agreed," shouted the merry Derienni.</p> 
                  <p>"Now, to make the thing all right, I will lead off with mine. It is not a very amusing career; but, as I make the proposition to others, I think it right that I should set the example myself."</p> 
                  <p>This brief speech was received with loud shouts of "Aye, aye;" and then commenced the rotary movements of a black brandy bottle, a lighting of cigars, and an arrangement of seats; when Mat, placing himself at the head of the table, with his tumbler of brandy before him, asked,</p> 
                  <p>"All aboard?"</p> 
                  <p>The boys replied, "All aboard," as a signal for going on, and Gus shouted in enthusiasm, "Hank, let her rip."</p>

                     <head>"LIFE OF LOAFER HANK,</head> 
                     <p>"As they used to call me. My eyes first opened on the 'Points,' of New York city. We lived on a back street, and had a full view of the Tombs in our face-a splendid prospect. My father's name was Harry Ryer, and mine is precisely the same. All that I know of my parents is, that my father and mother kept a small grocery, or groggery, and that they were nearly always drunk. They quarreled often, and both of them used to lick me like Old Nick. This was done to make me a good boy, I was told; but it did not turn out a very useful thing in that way, for I never was either a good boy or good man. My father and mother would fuddle themselves, arid then turn round and fight each other. Well, when I was very small, the rowdy boys who used to come to our grocery, delighted in getting me drunk, so that, when I was six years old, I could drink any quantity of whiskey and rum, and smoke pipes and dance break downs, and so forth. I was a lusty little fellow, and was as hard as nails. At ten, I could whip everything of my age on the Points, and was considered a very promising youngster. Well, then, I went out with papers, and soon acquired a taste for becoming a fireman, and used to get drunk nearly every night. I soon found newspaper selling too unprofitable an employment, so I turned porter at eighteen, and was strong and commanded good wages; but I was not to be relied upon for punctuality, because I would repeatedly go off and get drunk. They soon discharged me. I then worked as a porter down at the ferries, drove a hack, or worked on a steamboat. I then married a young Irish woman, named Polly Maguire, she was a faithful good creature, but could not endure my bad treatment, late hours, and the cruel beatings to which I subjected her. We had a child-a boy; but, thank God, it died! the same day, too, that my mother died of delirium tremens; and my father soon afterward out his throat. I became a reg'lar loafer. I would n't work. All I would do was, engage for a few shillings, or a promise of drink, to make up one for an election muss. Yes, I certainly did the public some good by attending fires. One morning I returned at about three o'clock, and I found Polly up, ironing away. It was a hot night, and she stood there, almost falling from exhaustion, having been at work since five in the same morning. I had no pity for her, nor consideration. She chided me, poor thing, and I, monster as I was, grew irritated and quarrelsome, and ended by striking Polly, so that she fell, and then I kicked her ferociously. There she lay, bleeding from her throat, and I struggled into bed, and snored away, unconscious of having killed my wife. But the next morning came, and when I went out into the room, and saw what I had done. I knew not what to do, where to run or go. We lived down a cellar in Frankfort street, and I was soon in the custody of a police officer, and under examination before a police captain, then before an alderman, and ultimately before a judge of the sessions. The counsel, who was provided for me by the fire company of which I was a member, succeeded in proving to the jury's mind that I was insane, the result of which was, that was discharged. I then loafed around, and became a kind of pauper <unclear>in</unclear> my fire company. I retained all my strength and vigor. I became acquainted with some fellows, and I then went to house-breaking. This was at for about two years, and made considerable money, but spent it as<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5727-00000092"/> fast as I could, and laid about, wallowing in my stupid love of drink. During the two years that I was at housebreaking, I had several tussle with the police; but, by--, I never knew the policeman that was strong and powerful enough to take me. Well, then, I went to canaling and boating, and this I enjoyed most deliciously. The summer I spent on the water, and the winter in port, among the girls, fighting, loafing, and drinking. I then made a journey with a menagerie, which was bound for the Southern States; and when I got as far as Mobile, in the State of Alabama, I left them, and went on the steamboats. I felt myself getting less addicted to drinking, and more attached to gaming and pleasure than ever. After which I started for California, and I became a porter at a hotel. Here I drank largely and freely, and then, getting into a row with a man at the bar of a California hotel, a fight ensued, and I strangled him, and left him for dead. I was pursued by a band of citizens, and making a desperate rush, I escaped. Finding a steamer leaving for the Isthmus, after concealing myself for a night, we got under weigh, and here I arrived. I fell in with Mat, and now I am one of the Derienni: and that, boys, finishes my story."</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE ATTACK UPON-CHAGRES-THE DEADLY AFFRAY-THE DEATH OF MAJOR PEARSON-THE DAUGHTER AS A HOSTAGE.</head> 
                  <p>A special messenger having arrived at the cabin of the Derienni, with a request, or an order, for six of the party to go down to Chagres, as an attack was to be made upon the house of Major Pearson, who was an exceedingly rich person, and who had irritated the Derienni by making overtures to the wealthy citizens of that city, for forming a powerful armed force, to put down this system of Isthmus plunder and robbery, and to bring to punishment the miscreants who kept the whole country in fear, and made the roads as much a terror to the traveler as a forest of wild beasts of prey. These desperate men were so combined, that it was impossible for a weak party to cross their dangerous path. Hence, it became necessary to travel in immense numbers, which was inconvenient, and attended with considerable delay. Gus. Randall and Pete only were left at home, to protect the house and their stronghold. The other six men went forward on their way, and managed to arrive in Chagres by night, and so stealthy were they, that not a word was known of the arrival of any strangers in their small, irregular, wooden city. The major's house was on the outskirts of the place. As the doors were not locked-no such precaution being considered necessary, the Derienni soon found an easy ingress, and access all over the frame house. There were twelve men engaged in this affair, and eight more were engaged in a similar affair at the same time, in another part of the city. They had been collected from the four various points of the Derienni's rendezvous. They did not anticipate a resistance;<pb n=""/> but, as an alarm might be given, they thought they would go well armed with men. At a given signal, the party took possession of the house, and stationed sentries all around, four in number, and several at the thresholds; and so they proceeded with the greatest care and caution. A party, to the number of twelve, proceeded to the sleeping apartments. They bound the several female domestics, but, much to their delight, they did not find a single male, so they made sure of an easy conquest. Upon the Derienni reaching the large sleeping apartment of the Major, they were surprised to see him up and dressed, and his daughter standing beside him, with his rich nut-brown locks hanging in confusion around her snowy brow. Her face was very pale, but was relieved from ghastliness by two small circles of color, of about the size and hue of delicate roses, on her cheeks. She was much agitated, and held in her hand a splendid small pistol, which she seemed more disposed to throw away than use. The room was occupied by seven gentlemen, armed, some with rifles and bayonets, others with revolvers, swords and cutlasses. This was a desperate sight for the Derienni, who did not expect such a terrible resistance; when, no sooner had the door opened, than the citizens, prepared for the rush, fired upon the pirates as they were entering. Wounds were plentiful, but nothing serious happened. The Major took the command; and, as the apartment was very large, and led to another by which the <choice>

                     </choice> had entered, there was a fair field for battle. The struggle was hot and strong. Single-handed combats and cross-firing were kept up for nearly half an hour. Two of the victims lay upon the floor. The windows were shattered in their frames, and the walls and every piece of furniture, were perforated with shot. The major shouted out of the window-"Boys, scour the grounds," when the door of a barn suddenly opened, and several men rushed out, armed to the teeth; and the sentries of the Derienni, who thought their occupation was merely a sinecure, in a moment had to fight for their lives. As the citizen volunteers were evidently getting the worst of it, notwithstanding that the Derienni on sentry in the garden had made a rush up stairs, being less in number by fifteen than their opponents, this brought the numerical strength to the side of the defending party. But it availed them not, for the Derienni fought with their usual bravery and fearlessness, while the opposing party were not prepared for so fearless and bloodthirsty an attack. The major was engaged with Cal, a Derienni. The former was a tall, powerful, fine-looking gentleman of about fifty summers; but the latter succeeded in getting him down, and ran a long dirk into the brave man's heart, who did not even groan or wince. His daughter no sooner saw this, than with a desperate nerve she pulled the pistol, and before Cal could draw breath enough to raise him from his position, kneeling, as he was, over the corpse of the major, a ball had entered his neck, and he rolled over, and, with a heavy force, fell upon his face, gave a deep groan, tried to raise himself up, fell again with still heavier sound, and died. The fighting was desperate all around, and several lay upon the ground, bleeding and groaning. A rude hand caught the major's daughter by the waist, and carrying her a great distance, to where the Derienni had their mules, brought out a mule, a man following in the wake. The two, by sheer force, lifted her upon the beast, one mounting by her side; and Roda Pearson, half fainting and insensible, was riding away, with an assassin as<pb n="196 (Illustration) -197" xml:id="VAC5727-00000093"/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> an escort, to the Derienni's cabin. But fifteen of the band survived this dreadful attack; and twenty-two of the citizens was all that survived. The Derienni retreated irregularly until the whole party were back again. The last man who left was Mat; but so accomplished a pirate was he, that, although wounded, he would not leave the spot, until he had possessed himself of the deceased major's money, and, with one of the enemy's guns, he battered in the safe door-a rudely-constructed affair-and possessed himself of a large sum of money. We mentioned that another section of the Derienni had gone off to another place. They went to, an American commission and forwarding house, but encountered no great opposition. They made the best of their way to their quarters, and arrived there in advance of their friends, with their booty. Such a night, so fruitful in its gains, was, nevertheless, a sad affair for the band, and sadly did they feel it.</p> 
                  <p>It is morning. The cabins are all filled; but there is no joy nor festive occasion; no laughing; no light and happy faces, as name after name is mentioned, and old companions are known to be dead. But there is a new and strange feature to this den, since last we saw it. There sits, crouched in the corner, a most beautiful girl, whose face is innocence and charity. Oh, what a companion is she to those sanguinary and criminal faces who swarm around her. Her heart is nearly broken; her sobs are loud; her shrieking wild, and her grief is heart-rending. She mourns the loss of a father, whom she saw cut down by her side. She tried to save his life, but success was not hers; she only avenged his death. The Derienni plied her with food, but she would neither accept food nor consolation. For two days after her being first brought into the log hut, she neither slept nor ate, nor tasted of anything but water.</p>

                  <p>For satisfaction, we will state that the major was prepared for an attack upon the Derienni, but not by them. That afternoon, he had collected all the men and cattle under his roof, for the purpose of scouring the country in search of these scourges of the Isthmus. But accidentally going up to the top of a very high turret, he observed the Derienni approach the city. He knew it was them by their swift and rapid riding; none else ventured beyond a mere walk or canter. He came down, and arranged his men, part of them-the most part-in the barn, the fewer with him up stairs; wishing to receive the party with open arms, at his own residence, which he instinctively felt sure they were about to attack, for he was their known enemy. It is a pity that so noble a design was not to be attended with success; but the major was disappointed in his supporters, they being undisciplined and raw men.</p>

                  <p>Miss Pearson was lodged in one of the out-buildings to the log cabin which was fitted up with all the comfort that the Derienni could possibly furnish to the apartment. At night, the weather being warm, the men<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5727-00000094"/> paraded the grounds around the buildings, in order to keep watch over their fair hostage. Hank had brought the young lady away with no special purpose, but it was decided by the Derienni that she should be kept as a hostage. They expected that a truce, rather than an attack, would be the result of her being held, as the citizens would naturally expect that, if any force was used toward the Derienni, they would retaliate by putting to death Miss Pearson. She had never spoken since she had been with them, and had not even asked for anything, save of the old negro cook. The extra members of the band had retired to their old quarters, and this left the cabin with the same number of male inhabitants that it possessed when we first introduced it to the reader. We have already spoken, in terms of faint praise, of Miss Pearson's beauty. Her pensive look added a charm to her very beautiful countenance, and her silence lent a holy influence to the young girl. She sat on a low seat, occasionally, among the banditti, but did not join any of their affairs by word or look; and it was gratifying to notice that they did not insult her by carousals or bacchanalian feasts. In the course of one of their evening sittings, Mat called upon Joe for his life; to which he replied that he supposed an apology would not be received. The boss nodded as though he had guessed aright.</p>

                     <head>"THE LIFE AND VICISSITUDES OF JOSEPH S. BARTON,</head> 
                     <p>"Your humble servant.</p> 
                     <p>"I am a native of Ohio, I was born within a mile of Sandusky city. My folks were in the farming way, and had made considerable money by laying out their once splendid farm in village lots; for part of the city was built upon the estate. I went to school in due course, and received every kind of preferment that could be bestowed upon a youth. I was considered a very excellent scholar, and my parents, who were staunch old-school Presbyterians, had determined upon making a clergyman of me. I went to Harvard, and proceeded well, both in my theology and general education. My character was considered unimpeachable; and my parents looked forward to my introduction, or installation, into a pulpit, with hope, and expectation of my leading in that serious and splendid mission. I went to the city of Boston, to study under a theologian of great celebrity; and at the church where I used to attend, I became acquainted with a beautiful girl, who used to sing in the chorus."</p> 
                     <p>Here Joe looked down, and hesitated to go on, when the boss said,</p> 
                     <p>"Joe, go on boy; keep her full, and, by--, go ahead."</p> 
                     <p>Joe felt encouraged by the peculiar language of their nautical leader.</p> 
                     <p>"We became very much acquainted," said he," and, in fact, I loved her with my whole soul. She was indeed a beauty; so serene and lovely that I felt myself grow better and happier in her society; till, at length, she grew sickly. The color left her rosy cheeks, and her rich, full, mellow, ruby lips became parched and dry. I observed all these stages of decay growing upon her. She became a blighted flower, and King Consumption marked her for his victim. The winter came, and the snow reflected upon her cheeks. She was lividly pale. The church had no more charms for me, I grieve to say it, since Lilla had ceased to sing in it. The psalms<pb n=""/> seemed indeed without melody, when her voice was missing. I looked upon her successor as a veritable usurper of her position. Till one day Lilla laid herself upon her snow-white pillow, and went to sleep, but never woke again. My poor, poor Lilla had gone to the home of spirits-the abode of angels and rest!</p> 
                     <p>"When I learned that Lilla was dead-for I was insensible for many weeks-I became reckless. Upon several occasions I attempted suicide, but was hindered in my designs upon my life. I became a gay fellow. I mixed with some medical students, and soon became as dissipated a character as I had previously been a moral one. I spent all the money my father gave me, and was finally expelled from studies by my reverend tutor. My father soon came down; but, alas! how changed was he in his manner. He soon learned the tale of my depravity from my countenance, in spite of all I could urge. He entreated me to return home; but I was so dearly attached, so indissolubly bound to my idols, that I could not leave them. Ultimately, my father cut off my supplies; and, desperately placed and circumstances as I then was, I was prompted by the evil within me to commit forgery. I drew out a note, and signed it with a splendid imitation of my father's signature, for two thousand dollars. I took it to a banker's, with whom my father occasionally did business, and it was paid. When it came to my father's ear, the incident distressed him, but he paid it, and my crime was known only to him. Being a first-rate book-keeper, I found little difficulty in procuring a good situation, at a good salary. I pleased my employers well, and there can be no doubt that, had I conducted myself in a proper manner, at this time, instead of being a member of the Derienni, I should have been one of the prosperous firm of Meredith, Pratt &amp; Company, in Broad street, Boston. But, having contracted a heavy debt for a mistress of mine, for some jewelry and silks, I knew not how to get out of it; so, in an evil hour, I once more forged. This time it was a note upon the firm. I expected this would be unknown, as my first year's salary, of one thousand dollars, would be due before the note, which was only for five hundred and twenty dollars, became due; but it was destined to turn out differently, for the note was negotiated, passed into other hands, and I lost sight of it altogether. The day came, and I was arrested. The firm did not desire to convict me, but a sense of duty compelled them to make an example. I was thrown into prison, but I came out a much worse character than I had gone in; there was no separate confinement then in jails. As I was coming out of the prison walls, I was met by a man, whom I knew not, who shook me by the hand, and asked me whether I was named J. S. Barton. He took me to his house, and treated me very generously. I was surprised at all this, and could not fathom his motives in paying me such generous attention. He supplied me plentifully with money, and I once more dressed in style; and although I could not mix with my old companions, I was, nevertheless, well satisfied with my position, so much better was it than I could have dared to hope for. In about a fortnight more, he said to me that he was a counterfeiter upon a large scale, and that he had men scattered over the Union, to whom he sold bad notes. He then took me under ground, and showed me his apparatus. He was an engraver of the best kind, and his success at counterfeiting was beyond detection. He told me that, as I understood forging signatures, he<pb n="200-201 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000095"/> would transfer that branch over to me, the only one in which he occasionally failed, and would give me half what he had in the world, and half his profits. I should mention that all the persons he had here were ourselves and an old lady, his own mother, who was in perfect ignorance of what her son did for his living. I was very successful in the business, and our affairs went along most prosperously; till, about a year afterward, the police became aware, by some means we could not determine, of our operations, and as we were one night working in our shop under ground, we were alarmed by a rush to the door, which we, confident of our security, had left carelessly ajar. A rush was made by four police. They came, two to each of us, and we were, after a brief resistance, beat, and dragged off to the police station; but not before I succeeded in throwing into the face of one of the officers, the contents of a bottle of oil of vitriol, which was standing upon the bench, and which we used in our business. The officer's eyes were burnt out of his head, and his face was a chawed, crisp circle of blackness. I felt horror-stricken at the deed I had committed. We were tried, convicted, and sent to the state prison of Massachusetts for a period of three years each. When we came out again, my companion and I betook ourselves to New York city, where, with the aid of an exchange broker, supposed by the world to be a highly respectable, moral and religious member of society, we once more carried on a successful career of counterfeiting; until our place was broken into one night in our absence, and every thing smashed; but, gaining scent, through a friend, we did not return, but took to a retired neighborhood. The California fever broke out about this time, and my friend and I thought it would not be a bad spec' to counterfeit steamboat passage tickets. This was a very profitable game, until it was exposed by some of the newspapers, and then it blow'd up. We were pursued hotly by the police, and I took steamer for Panama, whither I arrived, and then fell in with the Derienni.</p> 
                     <p>"This, as far, boys, as I know; but God knows what may be the termination of my career, as I am only twenty-seven years of age now. I hope to God that there may be some change! for, great rascal as I have hitherto been, I believe that I shall yet live to do penance for my great crime, in having caused the breaking of my mother's heart, and the ruining of my parents' domestic hearth."</p>

                     <p>Roda listened with varied emotions to the life of Barton, now of pity, then of sorrow, anon in anger, then in contempt and fear. That night a vile proposal was made to the young lady, which we would not repeat, lest it might offend the ear; but it is sufficient to say that the contaminating influence of such society was lost upon Roda. No, rather let us say that her religion and chastity were established upon a firmer basis than before; her love of goodness was more solidly rooted in her heart.</p> 
                     <p>The Derienni harkened with pleasure to the recital of Joe Barton's story; but Mat broke in upon their reveries by saying:</p> 
                     <p>"Gentlemen, prepare; we're off to the road in half an hour from this. Joe and the Spaniard will do duty at home to-night. Boys, stand by."</p> 
                     <p>There was a movement directly. Mules were brought out, arms loaded, clothes put on; and all being ready for a start, Mat gave a whistle. The Derienni jumped into their saddles, and were off like a whirlwind.</p>

                     <p>Roda, left alone with Barton, spoke the first word of conversation that had escaped her since she had been a prisoner in the cabin.</p> 
                     <p>"Sir," said she, "I have listened with pain and anguish to your story. I am sorry for you; and when, once more, I get back into the world, I shall pray for your reformation. Why do you not leave these horrible men? oh why?" asked she, in an imploring tone.</p> 
                     <p>"I can not," he answered. "If I were to go back into the world, I should be a still worse criminal than I am;" and Joe's manner seemed to undergo a change, while conversing with the fair Roda.</p> 
                     <p>Here there was a pause, when Joe, looking up, said:</p> 
                     <p>"Would you escape?"</p> 
                     <p>"Why do you ask me?" said his fair companion.</p> 
                     <p>The Spanish member of the Derienni lay sleeping while this conversation was going on; but if he had been awake, his utter want of knowledge in the English language would have left him in as profound ignorance as his heavy sleep enwrapt him.</p> 
                     <p>"Would to Heaven that I could!" murmured the girl.</p> 
                     <p>"You shall. Follow me, softly; softly, mind, or you will alarm the Spaniard, and perhaps our old colored fellow, the cook. Can you ride?"</p> 
                     <p>"Yes," gently replied Roda, evidently astonished at this strange freak in the robber's career.</p> 
                     <p>They then went to a barn, and Barton led forth a splendid mule, which, by a circuitous route, he brought to the summit, when Roda mounted. The night was soft and gentle, chaste and grand, and the girl, like a caged bird scenting the air of liberty, longed to fly to her native home. She said to Joe:</p> 
                     <p>"Farewell! God will reward you for this act. I can not sufficiently thank you nor reward you."</p> 
                     <p>"In another hour I shall be a dead man," said Joe, forcibly.</p> 
                     <p>"How!" asked his companion, her eyes streaming with tears of pity.</p> 
                     <p>"The Derienni punish traitors with instant death."</p> 
                     <p>"O, let me then return," said Roda.</p> 
                     <p>"No, no," said he, hurriedly. "Keep straight ahead, and go on. Good bye. May God preserve you!" and, with a bounding step, he hastened down the circuitous path to the cabin.</p> 
                     <p>Roda looked up, and hesitated whether to go on or not; but, at length, she started the mule, and the faithful beast seemed to make light of his bargain, and sped on with more than his usual fleetness; and Roda was soon in her own house. She retired to her bed, without awaking the domestics; but she could not sleep, for her mind was wandering in thought-now here, now there-till, at length, fixing her mind upon her deceased parent, she gave vent to her feelings in a torrent of tears.</p> 
                     <p>The Derienni had fallen in with some travelers, who were encamping for the night, and whom they succeeding in robbing of a large stock of clothes, bedding, provisions, etc., but of little money or merchandise, as they were adventurers to the gold regions. They returned to the cabin, and Mat, seeing Joe in a study, he immediately asked where the gal was.</p> 
                     <p>"Gone," laconically answered the other.</p> 
                     <p>"Escaped, by--," shouted the party.</p> 
                     <pb n=""/> 
                     <p>Joe then stood up. He said-</p> 
                     <p>"Fellow Derienni. I was touched with remorse and pity at the poor girl's position. Her virtue was jeoparded among us, and my better heart told me we had better let her go; so I gave her my mule, and she is, ere this, in the house of her father. I know my punishment; it is death. I am prepared to meet it. The review of my own career, as told by me, has made me sick of myself, and hate life. So, do your duty;" and Barton calmly resumed his seat.</p> 
                     <p>Then followed a short consultation and arguing; but Mat called Joe. He said-</p> 
                     <p>"We do n't like to make a target of you, Joe. You have been a good fellow, and a faithful man; though this last act will undoubtedly sew up the Derienni. Another day may see our best men food for ravens. The gal is sure to blow upon us. Suppose we give you money, will you leave us, and not inform?"</p> 
                     <p>"I will not promise," said Joe.</p> 
                     <p>"Then," said Mat, authoritatively, "he must die; and the sooner it is over, why, the better for him and the rest of us. Joe, you are the last man whom I thought would turn informer."</p> 
                     <p>"I am none," replied he; but I desire to die at peace with my God, and end at once this valueless life of mine."</p> 
                     <p>The men then walked around to an open place; and Joe Barton, kneeling upon one knee, after shaking hands with his old companions, cried aloud-</p> 
                     <p>"May God forgive you for your sins! May this sinful soul be accepted of Christ!" and then, folding his arms, he cried,</p> 
                     <p>"Fire, boys, and together."</p> 
                     <p>Then followed the rattle of several guns in rapid succession, and, Joe Barton lay pierced with many balls.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE PLAN-THE ATTACK UPON PANAMA-THE RETREAT-THE CAPTURE-THE EXECUTION.</head> 
                  <p>The Derienni, in as various branches, heard of several organizations which were raising, for the purpose of driving them from their stronghold. They knew that a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de main</foreign> could alone save them. They felt that the end of their successful career was drawing near. Their only hope for the present, then, was in destroying the band which was equipping itself for the work of extirpating the Derienni from the fruitful scene of their labor, the grand highway to the gold regions. Mat, in a council of war, decided that all the men should make an attack upon the quarters of the committee of public safety, as it was called, where the men and arms were located; and, thought they, if they could succeed in routing their antagonists for the present, before another and more formidable army could be raised against them, they would have the means of escape opened to them. This<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5727-00000097"/> course was then decided upon; that their whole force, which now numbered twenty-six, having lost many and received some few additions, should meet in Panama, and take the committee depot by surprise, on the Tuesday of the next week.</p> 
                  <p>The death of Joe was more painful to the minds of the men than all the blood they had spilled, separately and collectively; and those pleasant evenings which they enjoyed were forever departed, and the Derienni locked around them with fear and distrust of each other.</p> 
                  <p>Once more the powerful and daring band are together. They rise in their saddles, proudly and nobly; their steeds paw the ground as though they were impatient for the fray. The men are equipped in their peculiar and picturesque manner, and are plentifully supplied with arms and ammunition, concealed beneath their blanket cloaks. At a given signal, they start off in their <choice>
                        <sic>full full</sic>
                        <corr>full</corr>
                     </choice> force, having just met, from various points, by appointment, and dash along over the almost impassable roads with a speed quite bewildering. Their eyes roll with watchfulness; their eyebrows are knit, and their hands upon their stilletoes, ready at any moment for action. They approach the city in compact mass; and as the population did not exceed five thousand, and it was night, dark as pitch, they had no difficulty in reaching the front of the depot of the citizen soldiery without any alarm. The time was about nine in the evening. They were sitting in a large room, playing at cards, when one of them, observing a number of men riding about opposite the building, gave the alarm to his fellows, who readily understood that this was intended to be a surprise. In another moment the hot shot was pouring in upon them from the street. They made faint return, and this emboldened the Derienni, believing that their opponents were weak; but the facts were, that a few were keeping up the fire, while the balance were preparing themselves for a grand onslaught. As many had betaken themselves to the barns at the rear, and were saddling their beasts, a buckling on of swords, a shouldering of all sorts of muskets went briskly on, and in another moment the Derienni saw at least thirty well-equipped men facing them. They were obliged to turn their attention to this new force, and they desisted from firing at the windows; they engaged with the new comers; but their old adversaries now were quietly at the casement, picking out their marks among the Derienni, and doing more damage than the cavalry. The noise of firing and fighting brought out the residents from the more crowded avenues; they returned for their guns and revolvers, and soon were on the spot, engaged with the work of death. One by one the men and their mules fell; till, at last, a retreat was made by one of the Derienni, for the first time since they had been a band; but now, so far as valor was concerned, it was not dishonorable, for their blood stained the streets, and many of their opponents' carcasses were laying in the confusion of war and carnage around them. Others soon followed, and then after them, with a wild shout of victory, followed the citizens. The chase was carried on for more than an hour. Several of the Derienni escaped; others were shot in the retreat. A ball struck Mat's shoulder, and disabled him from continuing his course. He was captured and brought back. In another minute, Hank's mule was shot under him and he was overpowered and captured. Gus Randall was the last one who gave in; his mule, weary and tired, refused to go further, and he took to his heels;<pb n=""/> but he was soon turned back, and brought into Panama, a prisoner. The three who were captured, Mat, Hank, and Gus, have been introduced to our readers before. The two former have given their lives in their own language, while the latter has been cursorily alluded to. He was a rough and hardened villain, a native of Baltimore, and, while there, one of its most feared characters. He was the author of many fires and other crimes; and he had this night fought with more energy than any of his fellows. He had dealt death and wounds around him with an unsparing hand, and his retreat was one of the hardest and most destructive to his pursuers.</p> 
                  <p>At length these three terrible fellows were made captives. They were placed in the same room from whence they received their first fire. The safety committee is organized, and are keeping them company; such is the primitive state of justice in our more southern latitudes. Cigars and drinking are the order of the night, and the committee do all they can to make their captives comfortable, until their death follows upon the following morning. The remainder of the men are engaged in picking up the corpses and few wounded men, and arranging the former for burial. Bonfires are lighted before the hotel, as an emblem of success; and the place seems all hilarity, at having successfully met the desperate band, whom they thought was more numerous.</p> 
                  <p>Early in the morning the committee room is filled with townspeople, eager to catch a glimpse of the three terrible Derienni; till, at length, at about twelve o'clock in the day, it was decided that the execution should take place in the street, in front of the depot. Mat entreated that they might be shot, instead of hung, and this was granted, after much cavil and talk. The men were brought out, and a circle was formed, which was very difficult, for the people would rather have had the ferocious pleasure of tearing them piecemeal, than to have summarily dispatched them by shooting. But the committee did its duty, and although it was an execution by lynch law, yet no sentence could have been more satisfactorily carried out than this was. The Catholic priests were present, but the three men refused any spiritual assistance, and died as they had lived, full of wickedness, awfulness and crime. The citizens fired in great numbers upon the men, so as not to prolong their sufferings; and after the immense roar of some dozen rifles, the mangled corpses of the three men were carried to a retired spot, and there interred.</p> 
                  <p>To live the life that these wretches did was bad enough; and to die without one spark of contrition in their hearts, or one prayer upon their lips to their God, may be called fortitude or fearlessness, but it is the fortitude of demons.</p> 
                  <p>That day was a day of much rejoicing in Panama, for, towards the night, two others were shot. These were the negro cook and the Spaniard, who were in the cabin when Roda escaped. The others escaped by the Chagres river, it is supposed; but, as robberies and murders are not unfrequent in those parts, even now, we rather incline to the belief that they still inhabit the same log hut of the Derienni in their prosperous days of crime</p>

                     <p>Grovenor I. Layton, the subject of this memoir, was born in the beautiful village of N--, on the west bank of the Hudson river, in the state of New York, May 7th, 1821, of highly respectable parents. From his earliest infancy a precocity of intellect was manifest in him, which was allowed extensive range by his fond parents, who spared no pains or expense to fully mature and develop every faculty. Under such genial auspices he thrived and grew to the age of seventeen years, when his fond parents, after much thought and deliberation, determined to make an M. D. of him. Having arrived at this sage conclusion as to the future course and destiny of their hopeful son, the next thing to be taken into consideration, was to find a suitable disciple of Esculapius who would undertake the task of teaching him the healing art. Such a thing, however, was not very difficult, as the wealthy have but to mention their wishes and desires to have them gratified. Among all the M. D. 's in N--, and there was a goodly number, none had attained such a high standing as Doctor McK--e. He was a man of great erudition, who after graduating at one of the first medical schools in New York, had visited England and the continent, and studied under Sir Astley Cooper, in London, Ricord, in Paris, etc., and had returned to the United States full of medical lore, and established himself in N--, some ten years previous. To this gentleman Grovenor's parents applied as being the most proper person to carry out to the letter their wishes and desires concerning the future prop of their house. The doctor loving his profession beyond measure, fully agreed with Grovenor's parents, that the science of medicine was the noblest of all the sciences, and undertook the task of teaching him the science<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5727-00000099"/> with pleasure. This being settled, Grovenor was at once installed as a student of medicine in the doctor's office, and introduced to the pharmacopoeia, the study of which soon enabled him to compound pills and potions. Then followed, consecutively, all the studies relating to the nature and cure of all diseases "that flesh is heir to," and the rules for prevention and cure. Grovenor having a precocious intellect, as we said before, soon mastered the fundamental principles of medicine, and at the expiration of two years had progressed so rapidly that it was deemed advisable by his parents, being seconded by the doctor, to send him to the New York Hospital, that he might have "the ocular proof" of what he had learned in "the books," and also attend the medical lectures before the faculty. Accordingly, every thing was arranged for his journey to New York, and his introduction in the Hospital, etc. It was also arranged, that, as Grovenor had never been in the great city, he should make the house of a physician, a friend of both his father and Doctor McK--e, who resided in Fourteenth street, his home whilst in the city. It was a bright and shining day in autumn, the sere and yellow leaves were just beginning to fall from the trees they had so beautifully decked with green a few weeks previous, a fresh and healthy breeze fanned the cheek, imparting a healthy glow; all nature seemed animated and joyous with renewed life, and there was hurrying to and fro in hot haste as the daily steamboat from Albany for New York was telegraphed above N--, and a motley crowd were gathered on the pier, waiting, with feverish impatience the arrival of the steam palace that was to convey them to the Empire City. Among that motley crowd were four persons we have mentioned before, viz: Doctor McK., Mr. and Mrs. Layton, the parents of our hero, and Grovenor himself. This was the day fixed upon for his departure, and they were there to see him off, and bid him a short farewell. Soon the boat made the pier, and cast out her gang-plank, when a crowd rushed ashore, and another rushed aboard. The last shake of the hand was then given to Grovenor by his friends, the last word of advice was whispered in his ear by his fond parents, smothered sighs were choked down, floods of tears were dried up by the, application of white linen handkerchiefs, the gang-plank was drawn aboard, the pilot's engine bell was rung, the steam was let on, the wheels began to revolve slowly, the boat moved majestically out in the beautiful bay like a thing of life, and soon N--, was left far astern. At first Grovenor was inclined to melancholy, but this soon wore off, and gave place to pleasant thoughts, as the beautiful scenery on either bank of the noble and majestic Hudson river claimed his attention, filling him with wonder and awe. Thus he spent the remainder of the day in a half dreamy reverie, contemplating the sublime and beautiful<pb n=""/> works of nature and nature's God, until the boat arrived at her pier, foot of Barclay street, New York. <q>

How many bosoms have swelled with rapture, how many cheeks have blushed with shame, how many hearts have been filled with joy, and how many have sunk in despair, at the sound of the magic name of New York! New York! Well! There is no doubt that New York is the heart of the United States, that the different states are its arteries, that the issue of its ventricles gives the prevalent tone throughout the western continent, and that therefore the pulse of this mighty republic is influenced, if not indeed governed by its action. But viewed as it is without reference to its external influences, what a mass of all that is vicious, pleasing and repulsive, horrible and honorable, pious and profligate, brutal and beautiful, philanthropic and ferocious, artful and amiable, slavish and tyrannous, credulous and skeptical, solemn and absurd, superficial and profound, correct and corrupt, convivial and cold, impudent and difficult, soft and subtle, atrocious and true, cruel and confiding, satanic and sincere, heartless and benevolent, crafty and covetous, craven and courageous, despotic and obsequious, virginal and voluptuous, contemptible and venerable; in fine, what a mass, what a chaotic mass of all that is good and bad, admirable and abominable, with all the varied shades which intervene, does this mighty heart of New York present. Nor is it the heart of the republic only, it is a world of <choice>

                        </choice>; a world in which all existing feelings, motives, passions, and propensities are to be found in perfection developed. The first appearance of New York strikes a stranger with amazement, let him enter at which point he may; and more especially effective is it if he should enter in the evening. It was evening when Grovenor arrived, and as he had to go in a carriage from the foot of Barclay street to Broadway, and thence through Broadway to Fourteenth street, the blaze of the light by which he was dazzled, the noise of the various vehicles by which he was deafened, the magnificent stores which he beheld, with the myriads of human beings streaming on either side as he advanced, had their effect of inspiring him with wonder. Where could the people be driving to? What object had they in view? Upon these questions when they suggested themselves he had not time to dwell. The motives by which they were actuated were as various as their forms; misery, hope, joy, pride, vanity, crime, love, relaxation and revenge, respectively impelled them on; but of this at that time he knew<pb n="210-211 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000100"/> nothing. The merchant, who had just achieved a great commercial swindle which would stamp him a good man for life; the items man, who had been walking all day, sustained only by the hope of an accident, praying that some important personage might fall and break his neck, that some atrocious murder might be committed before his eyes, or that some destructive fire might burst out as he passed, and thus enable him to dine at Mercer's or Sweeny's on the morrow; the clerk who had just given notice to leave, in the full conviction that his "firm" could not get on without him, a mistake of which he would have the proof practically soon; the tradesman who had a bill for two hundred dollars due on the morrow, and had not ten dollars to meet it; the little boss manufacturer, who had been running after money all day, and could not catch it, and who for the sake of being a boss worked eighteen hours out of the twenty-four, for a far less sum than he might earn by working ten hours without all this anxiety, as a journeyman; the pompous actor, the envious author, the heartless lawyer, the accomplished thief, the unprincipled gambler, the gaudy cyprian, and the haggard milliner, the poor but honest man, the highly respectable because wealthy rogue, passed on alike, for Grovenor viewed them only in the mass, without reference to their virtues, their vices, or their cares.</p>

                     <p>Arriving at Dr. W. 's residence, he was cordially received by the doctor and his lady, who were expecting him. After tea the doctor was called out professionally; and his son Robert-a young man about the same age as Grovenor-proposed a walk, which was agreeable to Grovenor, as he had been sitting nearly all day. Leaving the house, they walked out Fourteenth street to Broadway; and then sauntered along, arm in arm, down the west side of Broadway, till they arrived opposite the Broadway theatre, when, seeing the front of the theatre brilliantly illuminated, and a crowd pressing in, Robert proposed going in, too-seeing that Grovenor had never been in a theatre before. The proposition pleased Grovenor, so they obtained tickets and went in. Everything was new and strange, and Grovenor's eyes<pb n=""/> 
                        <figure> </figure>
                        <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5727-00000101"/> roamed about the house, taking in everything from pit to dome. He was bewildered, dazzled and amazed, by all he saw. Soon the orchestra collected, and began to discourse most beautiful and eloquent music. The bell rang, and the curtain rolled slowly up, accompanied by the stamping of feet, clapping of hands, and cries of "Hey! hey! hey!" by the turbulent portion of the audience.</p> 
                     <p>The play was "Othello, the Moor of Venice"-one of the most affecting of all the tragedies written by the great dramatic author, William Shakspeare. When the persons who represented the character of the villain Iago, and his dupe Roderigo, made their appearance on the boards, and the representative of Iago commenced to embody and unbosom that which was most within him, Grovenor watched every look and gesture, and listened to every word uttered with breathless eagerness, and often were the flood gates of "the fruitful river of his eyes" hoisted, and his tears flowed copiously, as the tragedy progressed in interest. And well might he, a verdant youth, be affected; for where is the man-I care not be he a stoic, cynic or philosopher-that has ever witnessed the playing of that celebrated tragedy, and not been affected, by it more or less; as there "the mirror is held up to nature, showing virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure."</p> 
                     <p>When the green curtain had fallen at the conclusion of the last scene of the last act of the tragedy, Robert said that as there was to be an intermission of some fifteen or twenty minutes before the commencement of the afterpiece, they had better go out and take the air; and he led the way to the vestibule. Here they saw a crowd hurrying up stairs to the saloon. Robert then told Grovenor if he would be discreet, and say nothing to the old folks, he would show him a contrast to what they had just witnessed. Grovenor promised secrecy, and Robert then led the way to the upper saloon. The sight that greeted their vision here was indeed a painful contrast, and is a disgrace to the age. To his amazement, Grovenor saw some thirty young women, of different orders of beauty, dressed in the gaudy flummery of fashion and fancy shops, their attire embracing all the hues of the rainbow. Many of them with cigars in their mouths, others drinking intoxicating liquors at the bar, and joking, laughing, and talking obscene language; others were bustling about among the crowd of both old and young men, importuning them to treat them, (the young women,) at the bar, or buy them fruit, confectionery and pastry, sold by a woman standing behind a counter at the north end of the saloon. Grovenor looked, doubted, and looked again, on the motley crowd before him, and could scarcely believe what his own eyes saw. Could it be possible<pb n=""/> that all those lovely-looking young women were cyprians, wantons, commoners, outcasts from the pale of society? he asked Robert. It was scarcely to be believed, and yet Robert assured him that such was the fact. They moved on in the crowd, and anon some one of the gaudy cyprians would mark his verdant look, and putting on what would be intended for a most captivating smile, would ask him to treat her; but he being instructed by Robert, would politely decline the honor, etc. They moved on to the southern end of the saloon, where they noticed one of the gaudy cyprians sitting alone by herself on a settee, lost in deep, pensive thought. There was something about her very look, that spoke louder than words, that she had seen better days, that she had not as yet become callous, indurated; that the garb of licentiousness ill became her. Grovenor and Robert were both transfixed to the spot for a few minutes, with wonder and astonishment, at beholding so much loveliness embodied in a single individual. She was indeed a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau ideal</foreign> for a Venus: in stature about five feet four inches; hair black as a raven's, and flowing in a profusion of curls down her alabaster neck; eyes dark and brilliant, which sparkled like stars; forehead classically massive, showing the moral and intellectual predominated over the animal; nose a very little inclined to the aquiline; cheeks like twin roses; ears small; lips neither too thick nor too thin, but in perfection developed; teeth like pearls; chin neither round, long nor oblong, but beautifully proportioned; neck like a swan; skin fair as parian marble; and a bust rivaling the Venus de Medici; in fine, take her all in all, she was the most beautiful female either of them had ever beheld. No wonder, then, they were both transfixed to the spot at beholding so much loveliness. She had already risen, and was on the point of removing herself from their presence and steady gaze, when Robert spoke, in a bland tone, and requested her to be seated again, whilst he took a seat beside her, and motioned Grovenor to do the same. He then asked her, in a kind tone, a few questions relative to her name, age, where she was reared, how long she had followed the abandoned career, etc., etc. She looked steadily at him for a few moments, to assure herself that his questions were asked in a spirit of kindness, or whether they were mere idle interrogations; but, at the expiration of a short time, she appeared satisfied that his was not an idle curiosity, she commenced and told him the sad tale of her wrong.</p> 
                     <p>"My name is Irene," said the beautiful fallen. "I was born in the beautiful village of A-, in the Mohawk Valley, and am just seventeen years old the present week. One short year ago I was innocent-the joy, pride and comfort of my fond and indulgent parents.<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5727-00000102"/> 
                        <q>
                           <l>"But alas! the cruel spoiler came.'</l>
                        </q>
                     </p> 
                     <p>"At that time a young man, who was head clerk in a large wholesale dry-goods house, in Maiden Lane, came to our beautiful village to collect moneys due his employers, and transact other business. I became acquainted with him at a party, soon after his arrival there. He had a most pleasing exterior and insinuating address, which fascinated me from the first moment I saw him; and I being young and unsophisticated, having no knowledge of the world, foolishly believed all and every word, every vow and profession of love he made; and in an evil hour, when wrought to the highest pitch of frenzied love, I became his victim, under a solemn promise of marriage. But he kept procrastinating the celebration of our nuptials, under this and that specious pretext, until the time came for him to return to New York, when he persuaded me to leave father, mother, and everything that was near and dear to me, and come with him to New York, where he would make me his bride in a short time. Well, I, poor simpleton believed that, too, and fled with him; but, instead of making me his wife, he consigned me to the keeping of Madame W--, in Mercer street, where I have remained since. Thus you have a synopsis of my painful history," said Irene.</p> 
                     <p>It was, indeed, a painful history, and affected both Robert and Grovenor to tears; and they both hated and despised the villain clerk who had plucked so fair a flower from the beautiful country garden, and brought it to wither and die, contaminated with the vitiated city air. The afterpiece being finished by this time, and the house nearly empty, Robert and Grovenor left the theatre, and returned home, moralizing.</p> 
                     <p>The next day Grovenor commenced his studies at the hospital, where he won many honors. He had been there but a few weeks before he became acquainted with many young men, who took it upon them to "form" him, and learn him "the ropes," as they were pleased to term the corrupting and vitiating of unsophisticated nature. Among that number was a young man by the name of James Jones, the son of a respectable and wealthy merchant, who had brought up his son James as most boys are brought up-with a slight infusion of religion, administered in weekly doses, and a wavering code of ethics, enunciated and illustrated in a random and somewhat contradictory manner. When his father died, James found himself at the head of a thriving business, which he detested, and in possession of a good round sum of money, which he did not class in the same category as his business. Gifted with a jovial and genial humor, great animal spirits, and the audacity of a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parvenu</foreign>, he very quickly "realized," i. e., disposed of his business, and commenced his merry career; and, at the time he became acquainted<pb n=""/> with Grovenor, he was what is known in New York as one of the "fancy." The following are the appellations by which he was usually distinguished: "A good fellow," "a jolly dog," "a knowing card," "a regular brick," and a "loose fish." He had managed, while spending immense sums, to make acquaintances and learn experience, which enabled him, when all was spent, to turn his acquisitions to advantage, and make them support him. James knew everything, and could do everything, that a man about town is expected to know or do. He was unequaled at billiards, strong at whist and eucher, adroit at faro or hazard, great in culinary and cellar knowledge, knew New York as well as his alphabet, and, as he expressed it, "could give the most knowing a wrinkle or two upon some point or other." James had always some new acquaintance-or rather, let me say, some inseparable friends-whom he introduced into the glories and pleasures of "life." This friendship was inviolable as long as the young man's funds lasted; but as soon as the silly gull began to request repayment of loans, or to lower himself in James' eyes by retrenchment of his expenditure, then James was suddenly called away from the city for a few weeks, or discovered some splendid young fellow who really never allowed him a moment's leisure, and thus he would "cut" his dupe. It was Grovenor's misfortune to make the acquaintance of this dissolute and unprincipled young man, who, in the garb of friendship, practiced upon his unsophisticated nature, and undermined little by little the moral and religious principle that had been infused into him from early infancy by his fond parents.</p>

                     <p>It was a beautiful night in early June; myriads of stars glittered in the dome of heaven's high concave, and shone like a multitude of beacon lights of glory in the blue-black of eternity; the silvery moon, pale-faced Cynthia, wandering Luna, or whatever people may choose to call her, promenaded the self-same path pointed out to her from the beginning of creation; gentle zephyrs fanned the cheek, and countless numbers of bipeds were promenading that great artery of the Empire City, Broadway. Among<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5727-00000103"/> the promenaders lounging along arm in arm, intent upon no particular thing, were Grovenor and his new acquaintance and friend James Jones. It is curious to notice what an influence, either for good or ill, some minds exercise over others. The minds of men are as various as their forms; and superior intelligence, whether it be pure or prostituted, has its votaries. It was so in this case. Jim Jones was a man of the world, and as such knew the most vulnerable point in Grovenor's composition, which he attacked assiduously, but not overtly; so that at length Grovenor became fascinated, aye, infatuated with him, and looked upon him as an oracle. Having had a surfeit of promenading, Jim proposed calling on Irene, the beautiful fallen, whom Grovenor had seen at the Broadway theatre some weeks previous. Grovenor at first peremptorily refused going, but soon the sophistry of Jim brought him around, and he consented to be led there, although his conscience rebuked him for so doing. Turning down Grand street, they soon came to Mercer street, up which they went a short distance, when they arrived at the residence of Madame W--. Ascending the steps, Jim gave three light taps at the door, which was soon opened by a huge negress, who, scanning their features, and recognizing Jim, admitted and showed them into the parlor, where they saw Irene. She was looking particularly well. A flush of animation gave a tint to her cheek, and additional fire to her dark eyes. In her raven hair a string of costly pearls were woven; large glittering bracelets encircled her well-shaped arms; and a black satin dress set off to perfection her handsome bust, which was lavishly displayed. She was seated on the sofa, propounding some humanitarian question, when the two were announced. She rose graciously, and received them with the finished grace of a Lady Blessington. The room was garnished with immense mirrors, reaching from the washboards to the ceiling, while sofas, ottomans, lounges, and divans were displayed in copious profusion-all of which quite dazzled Grovenor. Jim ordered champagne; a bottle was brought in, drank, and then another ordered, and still another. Irene's conversational powers were brilliant, and brilliantly did she display them. The champagne, and the delicious poison that Grovenor drank from Irene's eyes, soon acted as a stupefying opiate to his reason, a dreamy languor stole softly over him, and * * *. The next morning Grovenor awoke with an aching head and heart; he rubbed his swollen eyes with his clenched fists, and gazed wildly about, hardly conscious whether it was some horrid dream, or a damning fact that he had taken the first false step. The stupor, however, soon wore off, and he became fully conscious, and sensible of the painful truth that he was in a brothel, and had passed the night there. Conscience, that inward monitor, sternly rebuked him for<pb n=""/> his sin and folly. Filled with tormenting thoughts, he arose, made his toilet, and hastened from the spot, with the haste of a pursued criminal, and resolved never to associate with Jim again. Well would it have been for him had he kept the resolution, but his mind was too weak to resist the temptation of seeing Jim once more, that he might tell him his opinion of him, and then separate from him for ever. That meeting was had, and it sealed his doom, for Jim by his sophisticated reasoning fully exculpated himself from all blame in the eyes of Grovenor, who became more infatuated than ever.</p> 
                     <p>A few weeks after the events just narrated, Grovenor and Jim were again promenading Broadway, seeking for some amusement; arriving opposite the Park, they strolled listlessly through the grounds, when Jim proposed going to a billiard room in Park Row. After a little persuasion, Grovenor allowed himself to be induced to go, and they crossed over to the place pointed out by Jim. It proved to be a gambling house, as well as billiard saloon, as will be seen by the reader anon. They knocked at the door, and after a scrupulous examination on the part of the porter, who did not at first recognize Jim, no one being admitted except when introduced by a frequenter of the house, they ascended to the gambling room, where they found rather a numerous assembly. There were three tables. That in the centre was the most attended; it was the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rouge et noir</foreign> table. That on the left was devoted to roulette; that on the right to hazard. There was a low hubbub and confusion of voices, above which rose these sounds, "Make your game, gentlemen," "The game is made," "Seven's the main," "Red wins." Grovenor approached the centre table, and was instantly made way for by the lookers on. At the side centre sat the dealer, before him two packs of cards placed together, beside him two croupiers. Opposite sat two croupiers, and a man who collected and shuffled the cards. Piles of gold, bank notes, silver and ivory counters, were glistening on the tables, enough to awake the spirit of gain in the most prudent breast. It was a most painful sight. The features of the players were distorted by anxiety, those of the dealer and croupiers had become hardened into masks more hideous in their sodden calmness than agitation could have made them. Painful also the contrasts afforded by the players. Some were reckless, others calculating; some were feverish in their impatience, others lost in quiet despair small sums which to them were fortunes; while several passed hours together, pricking a card with a pin, and trying to wrest the secret of the capricious goddess, by counting the turns of the wheel, and then after as much calculation and patience as would if directed to any honest employment have produced a tangible result, hazarding their solitary dollar, and losing it in<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5727-00000104"/> astonishment and dismay. Seedy, withered men were also there, whose whole existence depended upon their trivial gains, who nightly risked their few shillings, content to retire with a few shillings' gain which they took home to their wretched families, and if they lost, content to abide the loss without further risk that night. There was one man there who bore the unmistakable marks of a gentleman, in spite of the worn, anxious face, and seedy dress; he was never known to miss an evening, and never to play more than four coups on each evening. His stake was invariably one dollar, and it was rare indeed that he did not win three coups out of the four, timing his stake with such knowledge of the chances. With the two or three dollars he thus gained he supported a wife and six children. Is there not something singularly distressing in such an existence? To struggle nightly with the capricious turns of fortune for a miserable pittance, and to gain that, too, by consummate self-mastery! Yet there are men who choose such a life, rather than one of honorable labor; men who have mastery enough over their passions to be <emph>cool</emph> at the gaming table, yet not sufficient mastery to keep <emph>from</emph> it! This would be inexplicable, did we not know the powerful attraction of all exciting uncertainty, did we not recognize the inherent desire for emotional excitement which is implanted in every heart. In honorable labor such men have not learned to seek their excitement; they find it at the gaming-table, and hence the fascination of gaming. It is to be noted, in confirmation of what has just been said, that inveterate gamesters are thoroughly aware of the enormous disadvantage at which they play, thoroughly convinced the bank <emph>must</emph> win-yet they play.</p> 
                     <p>The scene was new to Grovenor, and affected him painfully, as it always does those who are not carried away by the infatuating passion of gaming; but he was there, and Jim persuaded him to try his luck, as he would be sure to win the first time. So he surmounted his disgust, inwardly resolving that whatever might be the fortune of that night, he would never repeat the experiment. The room was singularly quiet, considering how many persons were assembled. The sounds of bottles being uncorked, the clatter of glasses, and the chink of money, were distinctly audible, conversation being carried on for the most part in whispers. Grovenor played. Jim, trusting entirely to the good fortune which so proverbially favors beginners, abstained from giving him any advice. He played at random-lost. Twenty dollars were soon gone. He took out fifty dollars more-all he had with him-they followed the others. As the last dollar disappeared, Grovenor saw a young man heap together a pile of notes and eagles: huddling them m his pocket, he called for some champagne, and having drank it, disappeared. He came down stairs at the same<pb n=""/> moment with Grovenor and Jim, in high spirits. "That's what we ought to have done," said Jim. "Why did you force me to play," said Grovenor bitterly, like all weak men, throwing the blame of his own folly upon others. "Who the deuce would have supposed you would lose the first time?" said Jim. "Well, it is a bit of experience," said Grovenor; "perhaps I have bought it cheap after all." He walked home, however, as angry as if by no means so satisfied with the bargain. He was restless that night. It was long before he went to sleep, and when he did fall into a fitful doze, he was troubled by strange dreams of the gaming table. Sometimes he was playing with a pile of notes before him, sometimes he had lost every shilling, and awoke in despair, to find himself in bed.</p>

                     <p>It was a sultry day in August, 1844, and the sun was pouring down from a cloudless heaven intense rays on the main street of N-g. There was a burned odor in the atmosphere, arising from the scorched pavement, and rayed forth from the garish brick houses. Silence and noonday heat reigned over the scene. The deep and portentous stillness was brought out into stronger relief by the occasional whine or bark of some lonesome canine, or the rumbling of a solitary dray over the macadamized road. Only a very few human beings dotted the street, here and there, at wide intervals. Two ladies, hot, dusty and demure, were shopping. High up the street three or four ragged urchins were plotting mischief, or arranging some boyish game. A proud, young, and blooming mother, apparently about eighteen summers, was dandling her infant at a shop door, as if desirous that the whole street, "as well as the rest of mankind," should be aware of the important fact of her maternity; for sure there never was such a charming baby before! To one a stranger, merely casting his eyes down that street, nothing could appear more lifeless, more devoid of human interest, more uncheckered by the vicissitudes of passion. It had the calm of a desert almost, without the grandeur. In such a place the current of life would seem monotonously<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5727-00000105"/> placid, existence itself scarcely better than vegetation. It was not so, however. To those who inhabited the place, it was known that beneath the stillness a stratum of boiling lava was ever ready to burst forth. Every house was really the theatre of some rude comedy, or of some grotesque tragedy. The shop, which to an unfamiliar eye was but the depository of retail goods with John Smith as retailer, was, to an inhabitant, the well known scene of some humble heroism or ridiculous pretension.</p> 
                     <p>To the eye of the person who now leisurely paced the street, the town was dull and lifeless, because it had not the incessant noise of a capital, and because he knew nothing of the dramas which were being enacted there. Yet even he was soon to learn that sorrow, not loud but deep, was weeping ineffectually over a tragedy which touched him nearly. He was a young man of about twenty-three years of age, with the unmistakable look of a gentleman. As he passed her, the proud young mother ceased for a moment to think only of her child, and followed with admiring eyes his retreating form. The echo of his quick, hurried tread, rang through the silent street, and soon he disappeared, turning up towards a large house which fronted the river. He knocked at the door, which was soon opened by the servant with great solemnity. "How are my parents to-day?" said Grovenor, for it was he. "Low, very low," said the nurse whom he had addressed; "the doctor has just left, and he says they can't possibly survive another day." This was sad tidings for Grovenor; and he sat down, buried his head in his hands, and cried like a child. Only the day before had he been advertised by letter that his father and mother were lying very low with the small pox, and wished him to hasten home immediately if he wished to see them before they died.</p> 
                     <p>Immediately on the receipt of the sad intelligence, he hastened to leave New York by the first conveyance, and had just arrived at home, where the melancholy tidings was confirmed, but too truly, as we have just seen. Having relieved his heart some what from the heaviness that was pressing upon it, by a copious flow of tears, he aroused himself and visited the sick room, where lay the dear authors of his being. It was a heart-rending sight. There lay his fond parents, their forms emaciated, their sunken eyes far in their sockets, their faces covered with red blotches, and apparently lifeless. This dismal sight melted him to tears again, which flowed fresh and fast, when he frantically threw his arms across them, and begged them to speak to him once more; but they heeded not his request, for they were too far gone to know anything.</p> 
                     <p>All that day, and through the still and silent watches of the night, did Grovenor watch with them; and when the day broke, it<pb n=""/> found their spirits departed to a better world, and him lying at full length upon the floor, in deep mental agony.</p> 
                     <p>The nurse came into the chamber of death as soon as the day dawned, and finding him, gave the alarm, and soon the physician and others were in attendance. Grovenor was removed from the room, and the two inanimate forms that lay placid in death, were properly laid out in solemn state. Three days after, Grovenor followed the twain to the tomb; and as the last spade-full of earth was thrown into the grave, he burst into tears, threw himself frantically on the grave that contained all that was near and dear to him, and fainted. Well would it have been for society and for himself, had he never recovered. If such had been his end, then we would not have been called upon to write this memoir; nor would so many have been sent, unprepared, with all their sins upon their heads, before the great Judge. But of that anon. He soon recovered from the swoon, and returned to his now desolate home, full of sorrow.</p> 
                     <p>About two weeks after the burial, Grovenor was waited upon by a smiling, smirking lawyer, who informed him that several of his clients, who were creditors of his father, wished to have their claims settled. A thorough examination of his father's papers, books, &amp; c., was then gone into, and the result of that investigation showed that his father had died insolvent-i. e., that by reason of speculations that Grovenor knew nothing about, his father had become so deeply involved that the whole of his property, when sold, would not pay half of his indebtedness. True it is that troubles never come alone; one calamity generally follows in the wake of another, as though one misfortune is not enough to visit upon humanity at once, but another must needs follow to keep the first company. Such is life, however, and we must submit to the chastening rod, whether we will or no. Grovenor was not prepared for this last blow; therefore it bore most heavily upon him, and made his life almost a burden too grievous to be borne.</p> 
                     <p>The hounds of the law came and laid sacrilegious hands upon every thing, which they advertised for sale at public vendue. The day of the sale came, and with it a motley crowd, and Grovenor had the mortification and misery of seeing one thing after another sold to the highest bidder, till all was sold, and he was a beggar. This virtually threw him in the slough of despond, and <q>

                     <p>His hopes, desires and aspirations, one and all being crushed by the events of the last few weeks, and every tie that held his native village near and dear to him being severed, he left it with disgust, and returned to the great city without hope or aim. The second day after his return to New York, as he was walking listlessly through the battery grounds, he chanced to fall in with Jim Jones, who expressed great joy at seeing him once more. Seating themselves on a bench in the shade, where the cool breeze blowing across the bay fanned their brows, Grovenor commenced and gave Jim a full and succinct history of all that had befallen him. They then rose from the seats they had been occupying, and started for a stroll. "Jim," said Grovenor, as they walked on, arm in arm, "I am going to ask you a question which generally disturbs friendship, but which won't alter ours, because you'll answer it candidly." "Grovenor, I know what that exordium means. Whenever a man begins in that solemn, circumlocutory manner, he can have but one object-money." Grovenor laughed, as he replied, "You have hit it, by George!" "Of course, I have. Do you think I have borrowed so much money without learning every symptom?" "Well, then, Jim, without disguise, I want to borrow a few dollars." "Make it shillings, Grovenor, and it will be quite as impossible. Egad! it is rather a queer sensation for one who has been so long a borrower to be looked upon in the light of a <emph>possible</emph> lender." "Say no more, you would do it if you could, I am sure." "Dog my buttons! if you are so sure of it, I'm not. I doubt whether I <emph>could</emph> lend. I don't know the trick of it; I should feel as strange and disreputable as if I were to pay a bill. Perhaps my friendship for you might overcome that; I don't know; perhaps it might. But it is all speculation, so let us trouble ourselves no more about it. As a matter of practice, judge how feasible it is, when I reveal to you the present state of my finances-four shillings and five cents, in good and lawful money as the lawyers say."</p> 
                     <p>Seeing the hope of getting any assistance from Jim was futile, Grovenor left him in front of the Astor House, and hastened to call upon those who had professed themselves his friends but a short month before. But he met with no better success. They were all sorry, very sorry, but just at that particular time they were very short of funds, and referred him to Mr. So-and-So, as the persons most likely to be able to accommodate him, etc., etc. Such cold, heartless comfort did he receive from his professed friends, one and all. Not one of them would lend him even a paltry dollar. Meeting with such cold, heartless repulses on every hand, he became desperate, and determined to have money some way; and as he could not get it honestly, he determined to get it dishonestly. The very night that he arrived at this wrong and<pb n=""/> wicked conclusion, he forged a check for five hundred dollars, on one of the principal banks, in the name of one of his professed friends, and the next day, disguising himself as a Quaker, he presented it for payment, when it was cashed without suspicion. This was the first crime he had ever committed, and his conscience rebuked him sternly; but he choked down all sensibility, and smothered every pang with the false philosophy that "necessity knows no law." That night he met Jim at Florence's, where they supped sumptuously, after which they adjourned to the house of ill-fame, where they both became intoxicated with champagne, and Grovenor passed the night in the arms of Irene, the beautiful fallen.</p>

                     <p>Ever since the night when Grovenor had first entered that gambling house, and lost there seventy dollars, the image of the joyous winner, huddling the notes and gold into his pocket, had pursued him like a phantom. He had resolved to play no more, and as his first adventure had been so unfortunate, he could not hope hazard would be in his favor. Men have extraordinary practical belief in their own "luck." Ask a man if he seriously theoretically believes in any thing of the kind, and he will answer, No. Yet that very man puts his name down in a raffle, or cuts cards against an adversary, or stakes large sums on any game of chance, "because he always wins," "because he is so lucky." Grovenor believed himself to be "unlucky." He was therefore averse to gambling. He had played, and "it was so like his luck," although the first time, yet he lost. In spite of this conviction, the image of that fortunate winner, with his "pile" of notes and eagles, would force itself upon him. While be was reading, while he was thinking-at his meals, during his walks, while dozing in bed-that figure stood before him, crumpling the notes, calling joyously for the champagne, and sauntering down stairs in thorough self-content. In his imagination he followed that young man through a series of fortunate nights, during which<pb n="224-225 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000107"/> he had amassed large sums, with which he purchased a charming little house in the country, and forswore the gaming table for ever. It was a most coherent story; coherent as imagination loves to be. The real story may be told in a few words. Three weeks after that prosperous night, the winner, utterly ruined, poisoned himself. Had Grovenor known the real story, it might have made him pause; but he only knew what he had seen, and fancy supplied the rest. Like a tempting fiend did the image of the winner pursue him; seductive, irritating, he tried to banish it by thinking of his constant ill luck, but it would return, and his present discouragement made the temptation stronger.</p> 
                     <p>"Jim," said he, "I wish you would take me again to Park Row." "What! you want to try another <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup?</foreign>" "Yes; I have a presentiment I shall win. At any rate it is worth risking a few dollars." "I am going there this evening. Dine with me at Windusts, and I will explain to you a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup de main</foreign> by which we must win." That night they went to the house in Park Row, where Grovenor had first played. Jim won two hundred dollars-Grovenor lost every cent. "Jim lend me twenty dollars, I am desperate." "Here they are, old boy; play cautiously." Grovenor seized them with a greedy clutch. "Make your game, gentlemen," said the dull-eyed dealer. Grovenor threw the twenty dollars on the red. The cards were dealt with leisurely precision. "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Apres</foreign>," said the dealer. The croupiers, in accordance with the laws of the game, deducted half the stakes on the table. "Is that your caution, Grovenor?" whispered Jim. "It is my desperation," he said, between his teeth. "Make your game, gentlemen;" "The game is made;" "Red wins." The perspiration burst from Grovenor's pores; the tightening suffocation in his breast was relieved. He allowed the money to remain in its place, again to take its fortune. "Make your game, gentlemen," said the dealer, in his unvarying voice. "The game is made;" "Red wins." There were now eighty dollars on the red, belonging to Grovenor. "Take up thirty," suggested Jim. "No; hit or miss, I risk all." The gambler's recklessness possessed him; he was in such a state of excitement that he knew not what he did. "Red wins," again said the dealer. One hundred and sixty dollars were now heaped upon the red. "Shall you keep the stake there, sir?" asked a smiling gentleman with bushy whiskers, who had taken great interest in the game. "Yes," said Grovenor, firmly. "Then I shall back against you," said the smiling gentleman, twirling a whisker around his finger, and throwing a dollar upon the black, with the air of a man undertaking an important enterprise. "Red wins," again said the dealer. "There's a rush upon the red," sighed the bushy whiskered gentleman, as his dollar was raked away, and three hundred and twenty dollars<pb n=""/> 
                        <figure> </figure>
                        <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5727-00000108"/> stood there as Grovenor's winnings. "I shall back you this time, sir; you are fortune's favorite, sir. Take a pinch of snuff, sir;" and with recovered hilarity he offered the box to Grovenor, who bowed coldly, and took a pinch. "Make your game, gentlemen," said the dealer. "Try the red again, Grovenor," said Jim, "but take up a hundred to guard against accident." He staked fifty dollars himself on the red. Grovenor followed his advice; he had now two hundred and twenty dollars staked. "The game is made." "Wait a minute," said the bushy whiskered gentleman; "I have not yet staked." He threw down a dollar upon the red. These three were the only players that backed the red. Upwards of five hundred dollars were on the black, and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup</foreign> was watched with breathless anxiety. With unimpassioned, inexpressive face, did the dealer throw down the cards, as if all the chances of the game which so excited the players, were powerless upon him. "Red wins," he again said, in his hollow, indifferent voice. Grovenor raked the four hundred and forty dollars toward him in a sort of delirium; the sight of the gold was to him like a vision of fairy land. The smiling snuff-taker snatched up his two dollars, and again requested him to take a pinch. "Pretty game, sir; very pretty, when fortune takes you in hand." "We had better travel now," said Jim. "Not yet." "Yes, Grovenor-come while you have got the money. Don't tempt your luck too far." "I must-I will play another <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup</foreign>. I'll try the red once more." "Do n't! be advised, Grovenor, do n't." "I must. "Well, then Wait till the next. Let this deal go by, and try the next." Grovenor did so. "Black wins," said the dealer. Jim looked at Grovenor, as much as to say, "you see I was right. "Grovenor smiled. His smiling friend was glum, for he had lost two dollars on the red. He threw down another two dollars again Upon the red. "Back the winning color," said Jim, staking fifty dollars upon the black. Grovenor made a pile of two hundred dollars in eagles, and placed it also on the black. He won again.</p> 
                     <p>"Now, Jim, I'm ready to go. Waiter, some champagne, and a cigar, waiter." Grovenor having called for the champagne, placed the gold in his purse, and seemed to have realized his dreams; glimpses of a fortune sparkled on the froth of the wine. His brain was in a whirl, and the chink of the money, the rattle of the dice, the unvarying phrases of the dealer, the brief remarks of the players, all sounded like fairy music in his ears. He was impatient to be gone, for he felt that he was succumbing to the fascinations of the place rightly named a "Hell."</p> 
                     <p>As he went to the side table for his hat, he espied his smiling neighbor standing, looking into the glass, with one hand under his chin, fiercely pushing his whiskers forward so as almost to<pb n=""/> cover his face while with the other hand he made terrific menaces at the reflection of that face in the glass. "Ugh! you old fool," he vituperated his own image, at the same time shaking his fist at it. "Did I not <emph>tell</emph> you <emph>so?</emph> Did I not say you would lose? You donkey! you donkey! Ten dollars have you thrown away this blessed night! Ten dollars! Will you never learn wisdom? will you never leave off play? Donkey! fool! donkey!" Grovenor with difficulty restrained his laughter, and advanced saying, "I'm sorry you have not been <emph>fortunate,</emph> sir." "You are sorry, are you?" fiercely replied the little man, sharply turning round upon him, delighted at having some one else on whom to vent his wrath. "And pray, sir, who are you? Who are you, sir, that presumes to be sorry for me? Am I a donkey, sir? am I a boy? am I a noodle? to be pestered by the pity of a puppy like you? Do you wish to quarrel with me, sir? do you wish to quarrel? If so, say the word. I am not quarrelsome myself-not I; but I am not to be bullied, sir; you shall find that I am not to be bullied. You may try it on, sir; you will find it no go! And since you are determined to fight me, sir, fight <emph>you shall</emph>. You force me to it, but I am not one to back out of it." Grovenor looked at him a moment, in surprise and smothered anger, but choking down his passion with a desperate effort, he turned upon his heel, put an arm within Jim's, and went down stairs. The little fiery gentleman ran his fingers several times through his whiskers, and then turned again to vituperate his own repentant face in the glass. Having relieved his choler thus, he called for some wine, and left the gambling house for his lodgings-which he never reached alive.</p> 
                     <p>After leaving the gambling house, Grovenor and Jim walked as far as old Tammany, when they separated for the night, and Grovenor walked back toward the gambling house, and waited patiently for the little bushy-whiskered man, who had so grossly insulted him. He had not waited long, before he saw him come out of the gambling house, and walk up Chatham street. Grovenor followed stealthily behind him. Arriving at Orange street, the little man left Chatham street, and proceeded up Orange street. When he had nearly arrived at Anthony street, Grovenor approached stealthily, and seizing him by the throat, plunged a large dirk knife into his side, saying at each successive stab, "Take that for your insolence, you old fool! donkey! fool!" Each stab was enough to inflict death, but Grovenor was so excited with passion, that he continued to stab, even after the little man had relaxed the hold he had on his arm, groaned, gasped, and yielded up his spirit. Grovenor then dragged the body into a court or alley, close at hand, where he deposited it, and then walked coolly out to Centre street, thence through Leonard street<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5727-00000109"/> to Broadway, through which he passed, and soon found himself at his lodgings, when he threw himself on the bed, and passed the night, troubled with dreadful dreams.</p>

                     <p>The year 1848 was pregnant with great events; and not the least of these, was the discovery of that bane of man-gold, in California. The golden news reached New York late in the fall, and soon spread to every city, village, and hamlet, throughout this vast republic; causing a greater commotion than any event that had transpired since we had been a free people. "California!" "gold!" was in every body's mouth, from early morn till dewy eve; and thousands upon thousands of adventurous men bade adieu, and left fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, wives, children, homes, every thing, and started for the El Dorado of the Pacific, the Ophir of America, to reap the golden harvest. O! those were momentous, stirring times!</p> 
                     <p>Among the first who took the gold fever, was Grovenor. He became thoroughly intoxicated with the exhilarating idea of digging the precious metal. Gold! gold! gold! was his food-raiment-God. He consulted with Jim, who laughed in derision, and said "It was all gas; he'd not believe a word about it; couldn't fool him; no, no; he was a little too sane for that; and if it were true, he'd not leave a luxurious place like New York, to dig in the sands of California for the yellow boys, when he could get them so easily here-not a bit of it." Grovenor then betook himself to Irene, and painted to her in glowing colors, the pleasures to be derived from making an early start for the new El Dorado. They would amass such "piles," and return to New York, greater millionaires than Astor or Girard had ever been.</p> 
                     <p>Irene became as infatuated for the golden harvest as was Grovenor; and she consented to accompany him, as soon as he could raise the funds necessary to defray the expenses of the journey to California. This being settled, Grovenor determined to obtain the money by hook or by crook; and the most feasible way to obtain the money he thought would be to try his hand at forgery again. Accordingly he forged a check for one thousand and nineteen dollars, on a bank, in the name of a heavy jobbing merchant<pb n=""/> down town; and dressing himself in the garb of a clergyman; with white cravat and gold spectacles, he presented the check, and had it cashed without hesitation. Taking the bank notes he had received at the bank, he went to an exchange office, and got-gold for them. He was now ready for his journey; but Irene was not, neither did she get ready before the spring of 1849; and he was cautious enough to put his money in bank till they were both prepared for the journey.</p> 
                     <p>The spring of 1849 came, and found them both ready; and the month of April found them on the briny ocean, in one of Howland and Aspinwall's splendid steamers, bound for Chagres, N. G., where they safely arrived in due time. Landing at Chagres, they engaged boats to take them to Gorgona, at an enormous price; and after great trouble and exposure, they arrived at Gorgona Here they met with new difficulties: mules had to be hired or purchased for them to continue their journey to Panama, where they were to take a steamer for San Francisco, California. After much vexation and trouble, they at length succeeded in purchasing two mules; and hiring a guide at an enormous charge, they proceeded, on their journey. When about half way between Gorgona and Panama, they were attacked by three banditti, known as the "Derienni," who robbed them of their baggage, and took one of their mules. Not satisfied with this, they violated Irene; and then giving Grovenor a severe castigation, they suffered him and Irene to retain the other mule, and proceed on their way; and after much hardship, Grovenor having, to walk all the way, they at length reached Panama, quite exhausted.</p> 
                     <p>Here new and unforeseen troubles greeted them. There were more than five thousand persons at Panama, waiting for a passage to San Francisco, and no steamship to take them. So they had to wait a month; and in the mean time Grovenor was not idle, but was extensively engaged in little petty thefts, burglaries, and robberies, to get even with the "Derienni," who had robbed him; though what analogy there was between the merciless "Derienni," and the peaceable inhabitants of Panama, and the honest strangers sojourning there, has not transpired. At the expiration of a month, a steamship arrived, and took about three thousand persons on board, and among the fortunate ones were Grovenor and Irene.</p> 
                     <p>After a passage of twenty-six days from Panama, they arrived in San Francisco bay, to the great joy of all on board. The next day they were taken off in boats, and landed in San Francisco What a thrill of pleasure ran riot through every heart of all that immense company, as their feet pressed the soil of the new El Dorado! They had arrived at the goal, and were about to reap the reward due all their toils, privations, and miseries. No<pb n="230 (Illustration) -231" xml:id="VAC5727-00000110"/>

                        <pb n=""/> wonder, then, the blood coursed rapidly through their veins, and made their hearts beat with rapture. But their toils were not passed; they were only begun as yet, for the ground was to be dug, washed. etc., before they could possess themselves of the precious metal. San Francisco is beyond cavil the world's theatre. There you have people of every nation, the productions of every clime, and the work of every land. This empire city of this truly wonderful state, is destined to be ranked among the great cities of the Union and the world, for its growing importance, its commanding commercial advantages, and the unbounded enterprise of its Citizens. It is situated on the west side of the noble bay from which it derives its name. There, also, is to be found every species of vice, as well as good, that is known in the world-as there the most reckless, daring, vicious, wicked, depraved, and debauched of every land, and every clime, congregate and inhabit.</p> 
                     <p>Grovenor and Irene put up at the California Exchange; and after looking around the city a day or two, he concluded that he could make more money by gambling and other nefarious means, than by journeying to the mines, and slaving there for the glittering tinsel. As they were both thoroughly vitiated and depraved now, they were not at a loss to find boon companions. They soon opened a gambling house in Montgomery street, on an extensive scale, where all the thieves, robbers, assassins, murderers, forgers, counterfeiters, etc., etc., found a daily and nightly resort. They kept this "hell" open one year, when they were burned out by the great fire that destroyed more than half of the city; but they were soon in full blast again, in Washington street, on a more extensive scale than ever. Here they carried on their hellish work for nearly a year longer, when an event happened that made the vigilance committee turn their attention to them, which made them leave suddenly, between two days. The cause of this attention on the part of the vigilance committee, was this: A Spaniard, who had just returned from the mines, having some thirty thousand dollars in gold dust in his possession, had been inveigled into Grovenor's house, and being pretty well intoxicated, was induced to play faro, which he did, and quite unexpectedly won three thousand dollars, instead of losing his thirty thousand, as was anticipated. But he had not quite as good luck in getting away from the place, for they robbed and murdered him-as was supposed-as he was never seen afterward. This coming to the ears of the vigilance committee, they determined to arrest Grovenor, Irene, and all their associates.</p> 
                     <p>But they got wind of their kind intention, and fled to Benicia, on the north side of the Straits of Carquines, at the entrance of Suisun Bay, where they opened another gambling house, under<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5727-00000111"/> assumed names. They met with great success in Benicia, for a while, as there is a navy station and arsenal there, and the Pacific Steam Packet Company have erected a handsome dock, where their steamships come up to refit; all of which adds importance to the place, and brings an immense trade.</p> 
                     <p>One night after they had been in Benicia about three months, two sailors belonging to the U.S. Marines, were out on a glorious spree, and happening to pass Grovenor's place, the delightful strains of music discoursed by a brass band that he had hired to attract and allure customers, enticed them to enter, which they did, and drinking freely, they became quite intoxicated. They were then induced to play monte at a side table, where a beautiful woman, who was none other than Irene, was dealing. They were soon cheated of all their money, and not being so drunk but that they could see through the cheat, they became infuriated, and commenced demolishing the gaming tables, counter, bar, etc. This created a general row, and in the melee, both were stabbed to the heart, which caused instant death. Soon the news spread throughout Benicia, that a horrible and double murder had been perpetrated in Layton's gambling hell, and an excited and infuriated mob soon assembled to take summary vengeance on the perpetrators of the atrocious deed; but in the excitement of the moment, the villains escaped, no one knowing where or how.</p>

                     <p>Being warned in time, of the intended visit of the vigilance committee by spies that he had abroad in Benicia, Grovenor and his associates fled into the mountains back of Benicia, where they remained for weeks, almost famished with hunger, until the excitement had blown over, and their confederates in crime had arranged matters for a flight to some part of California where they were not Known. When the excitement had sufficiently calmed to warrant the undertaking, their confederates procured them suitable disguises, and arranged other matters, and they left the mountains, and came down to the bay, some six miles north-east of Benicia, and took passage on a steamboat going up the Sacramento river, to Sacramento City</p> 
                     <pb n=""/> 
                     <p>Arriving in that city, Grovenor and his associates gave out that they were just from New Orleans; and after looking about a day or two, they conceived the idea of joining their united capital to open an exchange office and banking house. This being agreed upon, they united their capital, which was some seventy thousand dollars, in gold, and opened a banking house and exchange office, under the firm of Brandon &amp; Co., as Brandon was the name Grovenor had assumed. Their good address, backed by a large capital, gave dignity and respectability to their business, and they soon won the confidence of the whole community, and also of the miners, who came there to sell their "dust," and buy provisions, etc., etc., to carry back to the mines; and thus they did a most thriving business.</p> 
                     <p>But honesty was no longer a part of Grovenor's composition; and he soon began to worry, chafe, and smart, like a wild beast confined in his den; he did not feel contented unless he was plotting and executing some dark and terrible deed. So he soon made the acquaintance of a gang of counterfeiters, who were extensively engaged in counterfeiting notes on different banks in the Atlantic states. Among the numerous counterfeit notes he received from the gang, were some ten thousand dollars in fifties on the Bank of the State of Missouri. These he managed to dispose of to the unsuspecting miners, who were returning to their homes in the Atlantic states, in exchange for their hard-earned "dust," paying them at the rate of seventeen dollars per ounce, when other bankers were paying only sixteen dollars per ounce for the dust. This seemingly generous dealing on his part, brought him many dupes, and put over eight thousand dollars in his pocket. It was a most cunningly devised and executed scheme of villainy, and worthy only of the abandoned wretch that he had now become.</p> 
                     <p>Not long after the consummation of this extensive swindle, people began to notice the many flash-looking men that resorted daily to this office, and it was soon whispered about that he was no better than he should be. As soon as this breath of suspicion began to float about, a certain man who envied him his success, hired a stranger to take some dust to Grovenor, and offer it for sale, and whilst negotiating its sale, to strive and obtain something derogatory to his character, etc. The plan succeeded beyond the envious man's most sanguine expectations; for Grovenor, not suspecting any thing, bought the dust of the stranger, and paid seventeen dollars per ounce for it, in counterfeit notes on the State Bank of Ohio. This was soon known, and immediate steps were taken to arrest him; but when they came to his office, he had decamped. One of his spies happened to be present when the stranger who had received the counterfeit notes in exchange for the dust, returned to the man who sent him, and he (the spy)<pb n="234-235 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000112"/> soon notified Grovenor of his peril, and thus gave him time to escape.</p> 
                     <p>From Sacramento City Grovenor made his way to Stockton, on Stockton Slough, three miles from San Joaquin river, where he went under the name of Rawson, and soon connected himself with a gang of counterfeiters, and undertook the sale of the numerous counterfeit notes they put in his hands. In the short space of one month, he succeeded in disposing of some four thousand dollars' worth of these spurious notes, to the hardy miners, in exchange for their dust; and then thinking he had better leave before his swindling was discovered, he left Irene at Stockton, and went to Tuolumne City, which lies on the north bank of the Tuolumne river, a short distance from its mouth.</p> 
                     <p>He remained a short time in Tuolumne City, selling counterfeit notes; but not finding it very profitable, left there, and went farther up the river, to Jamestown, a small mining settlement on Wood's Creek. Here he remained a few days, when learning that some Chilians were digging an immensity of gold at Mormon Gulch, just a little north of Jamestown, he started for the Gulch, resolving to have a share of the precious dust. Arriving there, he found two men and a woman, Chilians, who had a rude cabin erected near where they were digging with might and main. They were able to converse a little in broken English, and Grovenor pumped them until he learned that they had been there four months, and had taken out some ten thousand dollars' worth of the precious metal. This was the kind of news he liked to hear, and he ingratiated himself in their eyes, by every artifice he was so well master of; and they kindly consented to let him join them at digging, and agreed to give him one-fourth of all they accumulated thereafter. Upon these terms, he commenced digging, and worked steadily for a week; but having a surfeit of hard labor by this time, and all suspicion on the part of the Chilians being allayed, he determined to rob his three partners of all their dust, decamp, and leave them in the lurch. To accomplish this, he feigned sickness one afternoon, and retired to the cabin, apparently to lie down, and take a little rest. When he had been in the cabin about an hour, the men sent the woman to take a look in the cabin, and see if the stranger was in want of any thing. Accordingly the woman repaired to the cabin, and there caught Grovenor in the act of breaking open an old chest that contained all their gold dust. She immediately halloed to her companions; but she had not halloed more than three times before Grovenor rushed to the door, and stabbed her to the heart with a huge bowie knife, and she fell, mortally wounded, in front of the cabin. By this time the men came running up, and Grovenor rushed upon them with fiendish ferocity, and stabbed them both<pb n=""/>

                        <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5727-00000113"/> to the heart, in quick succession, with the same murderous weapon that he had just slain the woman with. They both fell to the ground, with a heavy groan, and expired; and he then dragged the three bloody corpses in the cabin, to which he set fire, after securing all the gold; and while the cabin was still burning, he started with his booty, over the mountains, for Sonora, where he arrived the next day.</p> 
                     <p>As he was entering the town, the greater part of whose inhabitants are Chilians and Sonorians, he attracted the notice of many, who remarked his haggard look, and some spots of blood upon his clothes He passed into the heart of the town, and put up at the best house of entertainment, and told the landlord that he had just come over the mountains, from Murphy's Diggings, in Calaveras county, and had been attacked by Indians, two of whom he succeeded in killing, and made his escape. The story was believed by some, and by others it was not believed. About two weeks after this, as some Chilians were passing Mormon Gulch, they saw the ruins of the cabin, and turning over some of the charred and burned timbers that had not been entirely consumed, they found some human bones; this made them suspect that all was not right, and they began and searched some distance from the ruins, and found the mining implements lying just as they were left by the Chilians when called to the cabin by the cries of their companion. Believing that a foul murder had been committed, they gathered up every thing, and carried them to Sonora, and told what they had seen, and what they suspected.</p> 
                     <p>The dreadful news soon spread through the town, and caused great excitement The persons who had seen Grovenor enter the town a week before, remembered his looks, and at once came to the conclusion that he was the perpetrator of the infamous deed; and they at once informed the vigilance committee of what they had seen, and what was their belief. The committee at once had Grovenor arrested, and interrogated him, concerning where he came from, what he had been doing, etc. But he answered them so straight-forward that they were inclined to let him go; and were on the point of discharging him from custody, when a man stepped forth from the crowd and said, that he saw Grovenor in Jamestown some weeks before, and had spoken to him, and told him about Mormon Gulch being a good place for digging gold, as he knew some Chilians who were making their fortunes there, and upon hearing him say this, Grovenor said he would go there immediately, as there might be a chance for him too. Hearing this, the committee empanneled a jury of twelve men, and proceeded to try Grovenor at once. The gentleman from Jamestown, whose name was Wiles, was then put upon his oath, and swore to the facts as stated above. A stranger who had just<pb n=""/> arrived, then stepped forth and said that he would be sworn too, as he knew something about the matter. Being duly sworn, he deposed and said: that some three weeks before, he was going from Sonora to Pleasant Valley, in Calaveras County, and that he passed through Mormon Gulch, and saw the prisoner there, and then in company of three Chilians, two men and a woman, and that he stopped and talked some five minutes with him (Grovenor) therefore he could not be mistaken in his identity, etc. The evidence was too strong to admit of a doubt in the minds of the jury, so they convicted him, without leaving their seats, and he was sentenced to be hung within two hours.</p> 
                     <p>The committee commenced preparations at once for the execution, by fastening a block, through which was run a rope, directly over the middle windows of the committee room, fronting the street. By this time, some three thousand people were collected in the streets, around the committee room, and the culprit was brought to the window and told that if he had any thing to say, he had an opportunity then. Seeing there was no hope, no escape, but that he <emph>must</emph> suffer the penalty, he said: "For years have I exerted a passionate and reckless life, in a spirit of defiance to all laws that men consider, and reverence as holy. I have been incited by poverty, and the heartlessness of men, to do deeds that 'made heaven weep and all earth amazed.' There was a time, I remember me, when I was innocent, and knew no guile; but a change came over the spirit of my dream, and I turned disdainfully from the beaten paths in which my fathers walked, and followed in pursuit of a phantom which tempted me on with its luring smile and siren song, until its delusions have melted away, and I am to-day confronted by that judgment which I know full well is as certain as human action. I confess, with shame that I perpetrated 'this most arch deed of piteous massacre,' with which I am charged, and for which I am about to pay the penalty with my life. If this were the only crime I have stained my soul with, I might hope to be forgiven; but I have perpetrated so many crimes that I cannot hope to be forgiven, either in this, or the world to come." Here his emotion was great, and his utterance was choked by sobs and groans, so the fatal rope was adjusted around his neck, and he was run up to the block, by a dozen strong men, who pulled the rope into the committee room, and made it fast, thus suspending him by the neck, between the heavens and the earth; and soon that vitiated and depraved spirit of his left its mortal tenement, and departed with all its imperfections, to appear in solemn judgment before the great Judge of all the earth.</p> 
                     <p>That the sad end of the felon, Grovenor I. Layton, may be a warning to all, and deter many from taking the <emph>first false step,</emph> is the sincere prayer of the writer of this memoir.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <p>The Waldegraves came soon after the pioneers to the Genesee county, N. Y., and settled themselves in that splendid section of the valley known as Livingston county. Mr. Peter Waldegrave-the father of the unfortunate woman whose life we have to record-was the son of a wealthy and intelligent preacher of the Presbyterian persuasion, who bought for his son Peter an immense tract of land on the Phelps and Goodhue purchase, on the banks of the Serpentine and beautiful Caneserago creek. The estate increased in value many times its original price, and even the vestige of it which remained in the hands of its original possessor, was an immense fortune in itself. Peter Waldegrave was esteemed as one of the wealthiest men of Western New York-one of its best citizens, a good father and a highly religious and moral character. His wife was an amiable, religious woman, whose calm, dignified and pious demeanor was the subject of much eulogium and frequent allusion. The parents of Margaret were a pattern of that moral grandeur, youthful enterprise, honesty and benevolence, which characterized the New Englanders who first turned the sod of the sylvan valley of the Genesee.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret was born on the 2d day of July, in the year 1825, at Mr. Waldegrave's splendid residence, at the hedge of Lima township, on the Monroe county or Rochester road. The birth of this person will be well remembered by old residents, for it brought a child to the desolate hearth of the father, but robbed him of his wife, Mrs. Waldegrave, who died a painful death while becoming a mother. Who shall say whether Mr. Waldegrave was repaid in receiving a daughter at the expense of losing his fond partner in life-who had struggled with him in primitivism and plenty-who had worked in the forest, and shone as a brilliant ornament in her own drawing room? But enough. Waldegrave was a man of the world; and, as he brushed the tear from his eye with the coarse sleeve of his heavy coat, he mused with himself upon the responsibility of training up an infant in the paths of rectitude and religion. But great as was the task, he felt that it must be undertaken arid carried through. The infant Margaret was put out<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC5727-00000115"/> to nurse, and progressed well under the vigorous motherhood of Hank Meredith's, the wagon maker's, wife.</p> 
                  <p>At an early day, Peter Waldegrave looked about him for a teacher or governess for his beloved child. It is not necessary that we should attempt to describe his love. Fathers, you will best understand how a parent will love its only child, and when that babe's face is a reflex of its mother's, and that mother torn from our hearts, a young and blooming thing, and turned into clay.</p> 
                  <p>He succeeded, after much difficulty, in procuring the services of a young widow, who resided at Warsaw, in Wyoming county, and was recommended by the clergyman of that village as a sober-minded and religious lady. Her husband had died at sea, while on a return voyage from the West India Islands, whither he had gone to St. Thomas' for the benefit of a severe consumption, but, as we have shown, did not live to return. His widow had since that practiced the profession of governess and in that capacity she was to take charge of the youthful Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>Myriam Holmes-for such was the gentlewoman's name-was in her person an elegant and captivating woman, of well-stored brain and serene gentility, and pleased Mr. Waldegrave well, likewise her pupil, who progressed amazingly under her tuition, and betrayed great precocity.</p> 
                  <p>When Margaret had grown to be a girl of twelve years, her father determined upon sending her to a seminary, but found himself loth to turn from his door Mistress Holmes. She had won not alone Peter's respect, but his love, for her manners were so interesting; and, moreover, she had long since ingratiated herself into the affairs of the household, and evinced such extraordinary tact and capacity in the management, that Waldegrave ended by offering Myriam his hand and heart, which she accepted, and they were married, while Margaret was sent to Canandaigua to finish the education so hopefully commenced under Mrs. Holmes. The seminary was conducted by Professor J--, whose talents were universally acknowledged, and the institution stood high in the estimation of the public. Here she progressed rapidly, and was not alone the most talented scholar, but one of the most fascinating girls of the school. She became acquainted with a youth named Charles D. Ellas, and often strolled with him through the beautiful walks which encircle the splendid village where the schools of Charles and Margaret were situated-familiarly known to all travelers, being the county seat of Ontario. Charles Was a willful, daring boy, with an eagle eye, a proud lip, and splendid hair, which curled in grand confusion over his lofty brow; he was tall of his age, and was sixteen years old, while Margaret had been at school three years, making her age fifteen. She had been home to her parents at holidays, and no more.</p> 
                  <p>There might have been a courtship between these children; but, as our purpose is with the serious side of life, and not with the more trivial tints of a novelist, we merely mention this acquaintance as necessary to the proper development of the history of the extraordinary woman. She was a most perfect beauty. <q>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <p>During the time that Margaret had been at school, Myriam became a mother; and now that the girl returned, she found a fine boy of two years usurping her position, as she supposed. Myron-for such was the child's given name-had certainly made the heart of the father glad, but had not worked any change in the love he bore towards his first and eldest child. As for its mother, her conduct was not so meek, nor so loving, towards Margaret, but she played her part well; and this was not apparent to Mr. Waldegrave, who never imagined any change in his wife's or daughter's mind. Without any manifest signs of trouble, there was a dreadful domestic revolution working rapidly in the minds of the step-mother and step-daughter. Myriam viewed Margaret as a barrier to the progress of her son in its father's affections; while Margaret felt that the interest of a young child would make incipient to her father all the ovations and caresses he had formerly lavished upon her. These attentions having been paid her during her growth, she looked upon them as an essential part of her happiness; and thus worked things. After the novelty of home had worn off once more, and these mutual passions and jealousies had become seated, the hitherto happy home of Peter Waldegrave was turned into an abode of trouble, anger, dissatisfaction and hate. That which had been unseen and unwatched by the eye of the father, at length burst out like the burning lava of a mountain, and threatened to scorch and, burn to destruction all within the sphere of its fall. It bewildered him, and he knew not what to do: he was buried beneath the suddenness and weight of his misfortunes, when one morning Myriam, after a lengthy dispute with Margaret, came to her husband with tears in her eyes, and told a tale of bad treatment and insult that she had received from <emph>his</emph> daughter. While Margaret followed soon after, with her beautiful face flushed with anger, and her large black eyes flashing fire, as she recounted all the contumely that had been heaped upon her by his wife-of her slightings, and how it was her belief that even her father's heart had become estranged. Myriam declared that, if Margaret should stay in the house, it was her intention to leave it forever; while Margaret declared she had become sick of home, and could no longer submit to remain under the dominion and misrule of her step-mother.</p> 
                  <p>Many proposals were made, and truces entered into, between the parties, but all to no purpose. No sooner had the first excitement of making up, between the step-mother and daughter, died away, than the feud broke out again with renewed vigor and virulent spirit.</p> 
                  <p>Ultimately, after much trouble, discussion, and correspondence, both a profession and a teacher was found for Margaret. It had been decided that she should learn the millinery business, at the fashionable establishment of Mrs. H--, in Buffalo, who was to teach the young lady every branch of the art, treat her as a daughter, and looking both to the religious exercises and intellectual development of the young lady, who was, when learned<pb n="242-243 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000116"/> enough in the craft, to become a partner in Mrs. H.'s highly lucrative business. Her father was much pained to see her depart.</p> 
                  <p>Arrived at Buffalo, Margaret was fast ripening into womanhood, and was developing herself a magnificent flower from a promising blossom. Her beauty was dazzling-her voice melodious-her manners agreeable-her intellect fascinating. She was now but eighteen years old, and just the age and the person to become enchanted with the city pleasures.</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. H--'s polished manners, and warm concern for Margaret's welfare, endeared them to each other. To an experienced mind, this condescension in Mrs. H. will be easily accounted for, when we take into consideration the wealthy parents of Miss Waldegrave, and her great command of money. Margaret did not remark this; and if she did, she thought it was her fascinations, manners or embellishments, and advantages over the Other young ladies, that placed her so near to the heart and confidence of Mrs. H--. The circumstances of her training, and her recent quarrels, made Margaret an impetuous and passionate, self-willed girl; but her culture enabled her to conceal these things from the observant eye.</p> 
                  <p>It may be imagined, that being in business in a great city, boasting of wealth and prosperity, such a charming woman as Mrs. H--, would draw around her a great circle of admirers: this was so-for at this house visited more of the aristocratic male members of Buffalo society, than a millinery shop would otherwise attract. A Miss Bevington was Mrs. H.'s principal assistant; indeed we might say that she managed the whole of the business department-Mrs. H. doing little more than adorn her person with the most fashionable costume, and talking with the ladies, and chatting with her gentlemanly visitors, who would be repeated in their calls, during even business hours.</p> 
                  <p>Lydia Bevington was a beautiful creature-tall, dignified and lovely in her person. Her dark hazel eyes were fringed by long silken eyelashes; her cast might be called that of the brunette, for her olive complexion, and her delicately transparent skin, plainly stamped her as one of the darker beauties. She could sing and play superbly, and was an easy, graceful, agreeable, confiding and generous girl. Lydia's age was about twenty; and it was generally remarked that it was strange she did not marry, so many opportunities and offers that she had had. This splendid woman became the councillor, tutoress, and even bedfellow of Margaret Waldegrave.</p> 
                  <p>It was remarked that Mr. Florence, the son of an extensive ship-owner, of Providence, R. I., was introduced by a Mr. Ormstead, a handsome young man, who was in the same occupation, as agent for his father at the port of Buffalo. The latter was almost a daily visitor at Mrs. H--'s establishment, and was courteous, attentive and very acceptable to Lydia; while the former, by his polite and. manly courtesy, was favorably received by Miss Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>In the course of a few weeks, Florence made overtures of love to Margaret, which were favorably received, and much encouraged by Mrs. H-- and Miss Bevington. Mr. Ormstead lent his influence, and everything seemed to go along well. This being the first affection of Margaret, it was natural that it would be a warm and sincere one. Such it was, for Florence was unremitting in his repeated tokens of endearment. They loved each<pb n=""/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5727-00000117"/> other sincerely, and in a few weeks understood each other as lovers only can. Florence told her that he had come on at the mere mention of her beauty, for the purpose, if satisfied with her charms and mental ability, to offer her marriage. Things had taken a proper course, just as he would have them, and, as for herself, he had found, her more than his "fancy painted her." He had written to his father, and was daily expecting a reply; he moreover informed her that his parent was a kind and generous one, and allowed him full scope of his desires, and had no doubt that the next mail or so, would bring a favorable reply as to their union.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret reposed the strictest confidence in the truth of Florence's statements and well she might, for he was a man of probity and honor. But one day, while on a pleasure tour to Niagara Falls, previous to the letters arriving from Rhode Island, the couple were lolling upon a sofa, caressing and returning words of sentiment and love. Margaret looked still more beautiful, with her girlish womanhood-if we may be allowed the term-than ever, and was heart and soul in love with Florence. He, as he expressed it, "was dying by the delay of his father's-that his love was a burning passion, and would consume him, and that if Margaret desired an alliance with him, it must be by secret marriage, and at once." She protested and pointed out the propriety of awaiting his fathers' consent-he replied by placing her soft hand upon his fevered brow. Such a reply was irresistible. The clandestine marriage was arranged that night, and Margaret was the wife of Florence. That night they returned to Buffalo, and Florence, with an unsteady hand, entered upon the register of one of the best hotels in the city, the names, Mr. and Mrs. Florence.</p> 
                  <p>The husband wrote a letter almost immediately, announcing to his father all the circumstances of the case, and telling him that he had waited beyond human endurance, for his consent to their union. With anxiety the newly-married couple awaited the reply from Florence's father to the second letter.</p>

                  <p>The long-looked for letter came at last, and as Florence cast his eyes over the epistle in their private room, Margaret watched with anguish the changes of color, or rather the pallor which suffused the face of her husband; he sunk into a seat at the opposite side of the table-she learned the contents of the epistle before she perused it, from the face of her now distracted husband. The letter ran thus:-</p>

                  <p>While Margaret perused it line for line, Florence left the room. Before she had scarcely folded the letter, a report of a pistol went thundering through the spacious hotel. The thought flashed upon her, her husband had committed suicide. In a moment the door of his chamber was burst open, and there in a pool of blood, lay the dying husband. Margaret had just time to reach him when he made a horrible grin, which was intended for a smile, and dropped DEAD.</p> 
                  <p>As soon as the burial obsequies were over, Margaret returned to Mrs. H--'s house, but kept herself more secluded and quiet than before; she did not appear in the custom department at all, but confined herself exclusively to the working branch, and superintended the young ladies.</p> 
                  <p>Lydia and Margaret increased in friendship, and daily improved their association by confiding some secret to each other. In a, few months the latter discovered her proximity to maternity. The fact of her peculiar situation was known to Lydia, who was desired to keep the matter a secret, for Margaret did not wish to have it known, as her mind was fast undergoing a change, and she did not care to have the responsibility of bringing up a child. Again she nursed the false philosophy, that a child would make her widowhood unpleasant, and blight her hopes of a re-marriage at any future day. Lydia listened to these strange and unnatural conclusions without a wince, for she was an unprincipled woman, as the reader will see anon. When Margaret had ceased speaking, Lydia said.</p> 
                  <p>"Then you wish to avoid this thing, do you?"</p> 
                  <p>"I do."</p> 
                  <p>"You wish to employ some powerful agent to effect the object you have in view?"</p> 
                  <p>"Precisely-can you help me in my dilemma?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes; there is a woman here practicing the business of fortune-teller, astrology, etc., whom I can and will introduce to you, as she knows everything."</p> 
                  <p>"And now," said Lydia, "seeing that you hare unbosomed yourself to me without reserve, I will tell you a portion of my history that will astonish you. When first I came to this city-for I, like yourself, was born in the country, on a farm near Ravenna in the state of Ohio. My parents were not so rich as yours, and I came here to learn a trade, so that I might<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5727-00000118"/> support myself-I soon became an object of watchful attention to several young men in this place, and of all the acquaintances I had among them, for I was a coquette, I preferred young Ormstead, as he seemed to win my fancy. He was an accomplished and witty young man; his joked I took for innocence, and his manners I thought resulted from the morality that was infused into his nature by his fond parents from his youth up; and so I loved him, and reposed every confidence in him, but he abused the trust, and in an evil hour I fell into the snare that he had set to rob me of all that holds a woman's life dear-her honor. This was about three years ago, and about a year after I possessed an illegitimate--"</p> 
                  <p>"But where is it now?" burst in Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>"Listen to the end. You not only see in me a child of folly, but a murderess."</p> 
                  <p>"Great God!" said Margaret clasping her hands.</p> 
                  <p>"I kept my own secret, as I slept alone on the bank of the canal; and as soon as I was able to leave my room, I mercilessly murdered the little innocent, placed it in a large basket, with some stones, (which I had concealed in my room,) closed it up, took it to the bank of the canal, and threw it in. There was one splash in the water-a shudder-a fear-and all was over! I soon returned to my room, and pleaded sickness on the morrow, which continued to excuse me for several days, and not a soul-save God-knows anything about it to this day, no, not even my wronger, save you."</p> 
                  <p>"Then, how, dear Lydia, is it," after listening with mingled horror and surprise, to this tale of blood and secret crime in one she thought so lovely and innocent," that you can ever tolerate this Ormstead, after so cruel and base a seduction and desertion?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why, because I love him. There is an infatuation and a passion that I feel for him which is unaccountable and unworthy of me. I ought to insult him, and brand him to the world as a villain; but I cannot. No, when I talk with him all my asperities soften down, and though Ormstead should be my murderer, I should kiss the hand that plunged the knife into this heart."</p> 
                  <p>The friends then embraced, and slept, and dreamed in each other's arms.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret carefully concealed the signs of her approaching maternity from every eye, and in a few weeks, when her position became imminent, she removed to a very secluded house near the wheelbarrow point of the Buffalo Creek, feigning sickness; and as her means were plenty, there was no trouble about her being excused.</p> 
                  <p>About a week after the removal, on a very dark night, the heavens seeming to darken to assist Margaret's base object, she emerged from the doors of the house with a parcel in her hand, and rushed precipitately to the water's edge, and there like her preceptor, threw in that poor little innocent-and became at once an unnatural creature, for worse than a murderess is she who will deprive of life her own offspring, and that child so young, so innocent. How selfish must be her mind who would do such a deed for the gratification of any particular fancy, as Margaret did.</p> 
                  <p>The splash of the water aroused a man who was sleeping in a scow-boat, and while Margaret was hurrying from the spot, she heard a man cry out in a loud voice-"Stop, there."</p> 
                  <pb n=""/> 
                  <p>Electrified, she stopped a moment and up came a brawny-looking fellow who, catching hold of her wrist, said in a positive manner-</p> 
                  <p>"You have been committing infanticide, I know you have. I have watched you here for several days-I am a man not to be fooled. Now I want money-you have got it. Give me a thousand dollars, and I will let you go. Come, what do you say? will you hang, or give the money, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>"Good God! I have not the money with me! You would not see me hanged, would you?" asked Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>He briefly replied, "I do n't care anything about you, either one way or the other. It is not likely I should care about you, who would commit murder, is it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Hush! for heaven's sake, speak lower. I know not what to do, if we should be discovered here-all would be revealed. I will get you the money by morning."</p> 
                  <p>"I shall let you go, but I shall drag for the infant, directly," said he. "I have all prepared, and I shall hold that as a hostage against you. Now look ye, Miss, there need be no nonsense twixt you and I. I know your name, it is"-and he whispered it in Margaret's ear. She shuddered-"now I will meet you at Mrs. H--'s, to-morrow evening."</p> 
                  <p>"I shall not be able to return before three nights hence," observed Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, let it be, then, on the morning of the fourth day. Now, as you are sick, why return to the house and seek rest and comfort Do n't forget, on Thursday morning I shall be at Mrs. H--'s. Recollect, $1000-till then, farewell."</p> 
                  <p>Margaret faintly replied, "farewell," and betook herself to the house. She went to bed-no one having perceived her absence. Next morning she received a visit from Lydia, who brought with her the astrologist and fortune-teller, Madame Grous. Margaret at first refused the assistance of Madame, but upon her friend's persuasion, she received her as a confidant. Lydia soon left her friend again, and Margaret was in charge with Madame, who set about in an ingenious manner to minister to Margaret's wants, physically, and even mentally.</p> 
                  <p>The patient found great relief in her hands, and was progressing well and rapidly.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret said at length, in the voice of a sick person-"I do n't know whether you are aware of the fact, but I wish to conceal my position from the persons in this house, as well as all else."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, do n't alarm yourself my dear, I 'm very, very discreet-very discreet; do n't talk, that's a chick-a-biddy, said Madame Grous. I will talk to you, and you must do the hearing."</p> 
                  <p>Margaret smiled at this consideration, and the fortune-teller proceeded.</p> 
                  <p>"You see this is my business, and of course I have to keep quiet. I hear all and say nothing. Oh! I 'm very discreet. Any secret entrusted to me is safe, my business is to keep secrets. I am consulted upon all matters, of various natures, some very delicate questions indeed, in the course of a year, so I must keep my tongue and my own council. Oh! I could hang and imprison a great many here in Buffalo, if I liked." Margaret<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5727-00000119"/> shuddered, but the nurse proceeded. Oh, Miss-or shall I call you Madame? please say."</p> 
                  <p>"Madame, if anything," replied the sick woman.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you. Oh! I 'm very discreet. Ah! as I was saying, I have been in a great many bad scrapes, but then, I am the tool of others; they pay me and that is all they want to do, and ail I want of them. I tell them the means, you see. I am acquainted with all the poisons-their workings upon the system, but I use my knowledge very carefully. Oh! I am very discreet, I assure you; but I do n't tell anything about names. Oh! I 'm very discreet. People say, I wonder why they do n't put this beldame down, that's me Madame, but they do n't know all. I hold the secrets of thousands in my little finger, under this finger, and I can snap it at them. Oh! Madame, I could show up their dark doings; I know it all. I know everything about them. I know all about you. You were attacked last might by a ruffian-you promised to give him a thousand dollars. Oh! I know it all-but I am very discreet. Oh! very."</p> 
                  <p>"How did you hear of this," said Margaret, in a wild tone.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! my chick-a-biddy, lay its pretty head down, there, go to its sleep. I have talked too much. I know it; but how I know it, that's another question. But your secret is safe with me. I want no pay to keep quiet. No pay. Its my business to keep quiet. Oh! Madame, I am very discreet."</p> 
                  <p>Margaret having partaken of some soothing medicines, soon fell to sleep, and upon waking up called Madame Grous to her side.</p> 
                  <p>"Madame," said the sick woman, "I want some poison, for-for-for-"</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! you need not trouble yourself with any reasons, or giving me any account of what it is for; that is your business and not mine. I'm very discreet-name the effect you wish produced on the patient, and I will tell you what is the surest."</p> 
                  <p>"I wish it to take effect by degrees upon a stout frame, you understand," Margaret became bold and confiding.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, yes! I'm very discreet, Madame, put a very small quantity of 'Strychnia' in some liquor or wine, and administer it in doses, that is safe and slow," said the Madame. My dear continued she, "will you have the isinglass or the 'blanc mange' now? I have got a little of the poison with me, here it is," said she, fumbling over a reticule. "Oh, I 'm always ready. I 'm very discreet you see."</p> 
                  <p>"I am going to think a little," said Margaret, * * * she laid herself back upon her pillow. "I will take no refreshment, now."</p> 
                  <p>The patient soon recovered, and upon parting with Madame Grous, she gave her a large sum in notes, who took them with the parting words. "Oh, I 'm very discreet, my dear. I am very much obliged to you; nothing shall escape me-secret as the grave. Discreet, very. Good day, Madame," and the astrologist took her leave. Margaret started for home almost immediately.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <p>Seated in her private chamber, was Margaret C. Waldegrave. How different was she from the moment we first found her. Although still a beautiful woman, there was no trace of her modest and girlish character. Where had flown that serene and religious face, and whence had come that wild and startling beauty? Her calm and quiet looks had indeed gone, and a face betraying cunning, passion, and misfortune, was only there. Margaret was running over her pleasures of youth, and comparing them with her recent trouble. Oh, how great was her grief! what a contrast was there!</p> 
                  <p>The last letter she had received from home brought intelligence of the death of her father, and with it, a sum of ten thousand dollars, all that he would give her out of the estate. She had never seen him from the moment she had left her home to join Mrs. H--. How bitter were her feelings now. Her cup was almost filled to overflowing, and the gall was fast entering into her disposition. She had not shed a tear, there was no such relief for her; the luxury of tears was denied her. Ah! grief with dry eyes, is misery indeed.</p> 
                  <p>A low tap is heard at the door. She faintly and shudderingly says, "come in," the door opens, and in walks a huge unshaven man; his face was tanned, and it was only his broad frame which pronounced him not Indian, His eyes were black, but buried beneath a heavy forehead, and garnished by huge eye-brows; his black hair was shining and glossy, and made into two "pooties," on either side of the cheek; he wore a green coat covered with a large number of buttons; his hat was an old white one, with the flattest of brims, and put on awry; he had on a red flannel shirt; his pants were turned up over a heavy pair of boots. He was a brawny, tall man, very fierce in his looks, and with a voice almost choaked by hoarseness which was perpetual.</p> 
                  <p>"I am the man that--," he commenced.</p> 
                  <p>"Be seated, sir, if you please-shut the door. I do n't require any repetition of the sad scene. You want some money of me; will the thousand dollars I give you now, satisfy you quite?"</p> 
                  <p>"Perfectly; do n't want no more," he replied in a careless way.</p> 
                  <p>"Enough! enough," said she, rising from her chair, "I will give it to you, but I wish you to understand that this is all the money I can ever afford you, for my father has just died, and he has left me but a moiety of what I expected, and I have no further means of getting money in any amounts," and she proceeded to her drawer.</p> 
                  <p>He answered doggedly," I know all about it."</p> 
                  <p>"There is the money," said she, "there are ten one hundred dollar bills, they are all good.</p> 
                  <p>"That's so," said he, merely drawing out a greasy wallet and placing<pb n="250 (Illustration) -251" xml:id="VAC5727-00000120"/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> them therein, and then shoving them down into his pocket with great force; he buttoned it up, and with "sang froid," he said, putting his hat on the side of his greasy head, "you won't hear anything from me, Marm, in future, I warrant. We are friends! give us the tip of your paw," and he held out his callused hand, in which she timidly placed hers.</p> 
                  <p>"I am glad to hear you say so."</p> 
                  <p>"Good day," said he, relinquishing his grasp.</p> 
                  <p>"Won't you have a drop of fine brandy, that I have received from a friend? It, was a curious present to a lady, but it does for one's friends," remarked Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! you women, I knows all about it, takes drops on the sly. Well, I 'll drink with you, I aint a proud man."</p> 
                  <p>She brought forth the bottle, and she was looking about for a glass, which she knew was not to be found.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, do n't trouble yourself Marm," said Grous, and he lifted the bottle to his mouth. "By gollys," said he, "that's what I call the sort; why, do you know that beats mother Cockrane's brandy, and that's not to be winked at."</p> 
                  <p>"Well," said Margaret, "you are welcome to the rest."</p> 
                  <p>"Thankee," said Grous, and hammered in the cork with his clenched fist; stowed away the bottle into one of his huge pockets, and disappeared.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret reclined herself in the chair, and when she heard the street door close, said, "Great God! where will this end? my hands are stained with another murder; that man is poisoned," and fell back into her chair.</p> 
                  <p>We will now follow Rufus Grous, for such was the desperate-looking man's name, who had caught Margaret in the act of drowning her babe and who had just received the ten bills as the price of his secrecy; and furthermore, who had drank of the brandy, drugged with "Strychnia." The man returned to his bed, and threw himself upon it; his wife, who was the fortune-teller, was engaged with a lady upon some of the delicate and intricate affairs of her profession, and did not return home until night Rufus felt himself getting momentarily worse; but the infatuation of drinking, has such a hold that he never imagined he was imbibing his death from that bottle. He drained the last drop of the poisoned draught with the eagerness of a regular sot, and dropped back upon his bed, with a deep groan, and a struggle, his eyes bursting from his head, and Rufus Grous was a dead man.</p> 
                  <p>The Madame just returned, looked about for her husband, and found him upon the bed; she fumbled over his pockets, and soon possessed herself of his greasy pocket-book, and its contents. She turned her face upwards, and her eyes rested upon the repulsive looks of Rufus. She uttered a scream; the experienced woman knew he was poisoned, and the thoughts of who was the perpetratress of the deed, flashed upon her mind with the rapidity, of lightning, as she saw the bottle lying by the side of his bed.</p> 
                  <p>There was no time to be lost, Madame Grous never shed superfluous tears, but putting her bonnet on carelessly, and throwing her shawl over her shoulders, she called a carriage and drove to the police office-narrated, the circumstances of the case, and immediately officers-cunning and ingenious fellows-were sent in all directions. Madame Grous added rewards, to the emergency of the case, and of course, gave an impulse to the search<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5727-00000121"/> for the murderess. But, so far as the city was concerned, not an iota could be heard of her; the search was vain and hopeless.</p> 
                  <p>We will now return to where we had left Margaret in her chamber, at Mrs. H--'s. Immediately upon Grous's leaving, she commenced preparations for her escape-nay her race for life. We may as well just remark, that Margaret's motives for assassinating Grous, will be plain to every reader. She had no confidence in his secrecy; she concluded that a man who would take a reward to keep silent upon a deed of blood, would as cheaply and as readily expose it. Hence she felt that her life would be in the hands of this base ruffian, at all times, and she could not be secure at any time. Thus, then, by committing one crime, it will be seen that we must continue our course, to conceal the first. Horrid as this may appear, it is true; this accounts for the double and treble murders we so often hear of. It is not the design of the assassin to put aside more than one person, but there generally follows another which will be enabled to bring the murderer to justice, as connecting the evidence; and therefore, to escape punishment, another murder must be committed; and so on, till the murderer has felled by his own hands, more persons than he desired to do.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret disrobed herself, and, drawing out of the secret drawer of a splendid writing desk, a small bottle filled with an inky liquid, she saturated her face, neck, shoulders, arms, etc. with it, rubbing it in with the palms of her hands, until her complexion was extremely dark, and which gave her the color of an Indian; her dark hair, and dark eyes added to the illusion, We should say, that this liquid was the essential juice of the walnut shell, diluted, and will stain skin easily. She then drew from the drawer of a magnificent wardrobe, some garments which were entirely of the Indian character; and when draped in this costume, Margaret was a splendid specimen of a "Squaw," and taking some moccasins, and reticules, and cakes which she had purchased at a variety store on Main street, emerged from the house, and traced her way like one of the poor aborigines, we see daily wandering in our streets, shrinking before the superior intellect of the white man and longing for their own wigwam and hunting ground. She, Margaret, did not offer her articles for sale, but betaking herself to the dock, soon found a schooner that was going out for Port Stanley, in Canada West. She presented the Captain with some of her wares, and he took her on board, and they soon arrived on British ground. While on board, the Captain paid special attention to Margaret, and even went so far as to put his arm around her neck and kiss her; but this Margaret quickly resisted, and withdrawing from her girdle a splendid poniard, waived it in the air, and threatened if he did not desist in his improper civilities, she would plunge it into his heart It is only just to Margaret's character, to say, that as yet, she had betrayed no regular licentiousness, no base voluptuousness. She was fast passing into the character of an assassin, but not a wanton.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret next traveled towards Toronto, where she occupied a splendid suite of apartments, and applied a powerful acid for the purpose of removing the stains of the walnut coloring, supplied by a chemist; this, in the course of a week, entirely removed the color which she had covered her face with, during which time she confined herself to her room, and engaged no domestic. At the end of that period Margaret assumed her former beautiful<pb n=""/> complexion; but alas! since the poisoning of Crous, her face had undergone still more change, and now there was not a trace of simplicity nor meekness left in her face, but a haughty, proud, tragedy-queen like countenance.</p> 
                  <p>She engaged a young and handsome girl as a domestic, and who grew much attached to her, and the latter felt much respect and esteem for the girl, who was a young French Canadian with a broken accent; every word of which rendered a melody to the English language, and made Camilla still more fascinating than her natural charms.</p> 
                  <p>In the cool of evening, Margaret took a walk upon the principal street; she saw her maid in company with a man whom she was certain she knew. Camilla recognized her mistress, and blushed, while the man-a young and beautiful one-cast his eyes in the direction of the woman who had called forth his companion's blushes. A look of intelligence passed between Margaret and the young man; they knew one another, but yet neither could fix upon each other's identity. Till afterwards, while pursuing their separate course, turned over and over the images of each other in their mind, and still could not give an intelligent account of their previous acquaintance.</p> 
                  <p>The next morning, said Margaret to Camilla, "I would like you to introduce to me that young man whom I saw walking with you last evening."</p> 
                  <p>The young girl blushed, and nodded assent, and withdrew. In the evening they met. Margaret was dressed in the most consummate style of fashion. Jewels shone all over her person; laces adorned her, and satin lent a lustre to her magnificent beauty. The young man approached, and Margaret, in a dignified manner, pointed to a seat in which he, with very easy grace, placed himself-and opened the conversation thus:-</p> 
                  <p>"Madame, or Miss," said he, inquiringly, with a smile displaying a fine set of teeth.</p> 
                  <p>"Madame," said Margaret, with a bland look. "I appreciate your compliment, sir, but I am a widow."</p> 
                  <p>"We met last evening, and I at once recognized your countenance as a familiar one, and you seemed to know me, and yet, said he, with your permission, I will introduce an Hibernianism, we know not each other. It is of no use to bewilder ourselves further, here is my card."</p> 
                  <p>Margaret rose to receive it, and as she read it, with a start, said-</p> 
                  <p>"You are, then, Charles D. Ellas."</p> 
                  <p>"At your service; now pray, may I take your card?" and the lady pointed to a silver salver which stood upon the centre table. No sooner had he read it, than Charles shouted with astonishment-</p> 
                  <p>"And you are my old-my dear friend, my schoolmate, Margaret," and they were both lost in amazement.</p> 
                  <p>Soon followed mutual explanations, which placed Margaret in the power of Charles, for, without explaining her career, the matter was now so opened by police reports, as not to call for any secrecy in the premises. Charles's career had been almost as eventful as that of Margaret's. He had gone to New York to practice law, but deserted his professional studies, and became connected with the most depraved and dissipated roues, from whose society he escaped a gambler. He then went to the South, and from thence to the West, and went with the steamboats, sailing on the Mississippi river, and occasionally on the Ohio and Missouri rivers, where he followed the occupation<pb n="254 (Illustration) -255" xml:id="VAC5727-00000122"/> 
                     <figure> 
                        <p>J.W.ORR Se.N.Y.</p> 
                     </figure>
                     <pb n=""/> of a regular gambler. He did not hesitate to commit any meanness while at play. On board the "Red Stone," he one day was playing at poker, for large stakes, which resulted in the fleecing of a young western merchant-who, becoming irritated, called Charles "a swindler, and a coward." Charles always daring and brave, retorted with the opprobrious name, "Liar." Upon which followed, as soon as the boat came to a point, a landing between the belligerents, an arrangement of seconds-duel, and the death of Mr. Horace De Quincy, the young western merchant. Charles flew to the landing, there was a boat for Pittsburg, in which he took passage in. From this depot of manufacturers, he flew as fast as conveyance would carry him to the shores of Canada, where we now find him. Here he joined a party of gamblers who had taken quarters in a splendid house on King street, and were playing with the officers of the British army, who were there in barracks.</p> 
                  <p>The above is merely an outline of what had occurred to Charles, and but a mere fraction of what he told Margaret, but the whole of which it is not essential that we should repeat.</p> 
                  <p>In the course of the next interview with Charles, Margaret called in Camilla-her help, and told her to Charles' face her acquaintance with him would end in shame. That he would merely win Camilla to satisfy his own lust, and then cast her upon the world, a blighted thing. Charles hung down his head while Camilla watched her mistress' countenance, and turned over in her mind all the disappointments and procrastinations that Charles had invented for the purpose of delaying their wedding day. The light dawned in upon Camilla, and much as she had loved Charles, now as quickly and as warmly did she loathe him. She thanked her mistress, and told her she believed that she was sincere, and speaking her honest convictions. Margaret told her that she knew Charles from youth, and that he had just recounted his history to her, and from what she could learn, he was not fit to be the associate of an honest, virtuous girl. Margaret told Camilla that she was herself, too impure and vicious a person, for so innocent a girl to serve, and then presented her with a sum of money, and bade her return to her friends in the neighborhood of Quebec, in Lower Canada. Margaret now possessed little over seven thousand dollars, and with this she knew not what to do. So she consulted with Charles, who told her that she might profitably employ it by investing it with the firm of Fontainbleau and Company, who were the proprietors of the gambling house he was connected with. She did so, and soon learned to her dismay, that her entire property was robbed from her by the proprietor. She was satisfied Charles knew nothing of this, for he himself was reduced to the position of beggar. Charles now became the paramour of his old school-fellow, who now found herself in the world almost penniless, save what her jewels would bring; without friends, without any employment, and without a character. In this dilemma they knew not what to do, and had well nigh given up all hope, when Charles hit upon a plan-which was to travel through the state of New York, to New York City, and deliver lectures on Mesmerism and Animal Magnetism, as he had become familiar with those things, by attending lectures and reading different books relating thereto. No sooner did he inform Margaret of his plan, than she begged him to go<pb n="256-257 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000123"/> at it at once. So without delay they left Toronto, and went to Rochester, where Charles, under the name of Belville, soon had large posters posted all over the city, which attracted a large and respectable audience, night after night, to Corinthian Hall. From Rochester they went to Syracuse Utica, Albany, etc., to New York City, and met with good success in every place. Arriving at New York, they stayed only a short time, and then hastened to Philadelphia, where he attracted large audiences at the Chinese Museum for weeks.</p> 
                  <p>While Charles was humbugging the staid Philadelphians, with his mesmerism, etc., Margaret was not idle. She had managed by her finished address, as a lady of ton, to ingratiate herself in good society, and drew around her a coterie of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau monde,</foreign> who felt highly flattered to bask in the smiles of the fascinating Mrs. Belville. Among her visitors, was a Mr. Copeland, an owner of many collieries in northern Pennsylvania; a man, who, if measured by his wealth, was certainly one of the most powerful in the city of "brotherly love." He saw Margaret very repeatedly, and their acquaintance became daily more interesting and secret in its character. Charles never showed himself during his visits, and so Copeland enjoyed these <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete-a-tetes</foreign> secretly, till emboldened by the friendliness of Margaret, he made improper overtures to her. Instead of rebutting these things as she should have done, she merely sighed and cried a little, but did not yield to his frequent importunings. She told him that she was prepared to make any sacrifices for him, but that of honor. Copeland's presents were profuse and costly, and although Margaret did not feel any admiration for these baubles, no more than their marketable value, she pretended to be flattered with these things, and every word to his ears conveyed the idea that she was daily becoming more endeared to him. He asked again; she then plead the vile subterfuge of "What would her position be if it should be discovered." To this Copeland promised a competency for life. She at length pretends to consent to his improper proposals, and the millionaire was in ectasies when he found himself in the private apartments of the beautiful Margaret</p> 
                  <p>He was on the point of locking, the door, when a loud thundering knock came at the panel. "Open the door, I say! open the door! thieves! thieves!" shouted some one, but not sufficiently loud to alarm others. Margaret timidly opened the door, previously having disposed of Mr. Copeland in a recess, before which hung a curtain.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha! base cyprian, have I caught you? Is this your treatment?" and Charles swore and raved in a most natural manner, while Mrs. Margaret protested her innocence in a way which would have established her position as a first rate Desdemona. Never was a scene better acted-never a deeper laid plot so successfully carried out.</p> 
                  <p>Charles, after making sundry thrusts under the bed, and in the air, as if digging for a Lothario, suddenly drew back the curtain, and there stood, hat in hand, Mr. Copeland; he came forward, tried to speak, and so forth, but stammered. Charles locked the door, and Margaret was fainting, recovering-shrieking, and re-fainting in a most consummate manner upon a large velvet stuffed rocking chair. Charles then proceeded to curse his wife, and her Lothario, and asked what would become of him now? he was a ruined man, and he threw in some beautiful figures about his Jewel<pb n=""/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5727-00000124"/> being stolen, and so forth. Copeland whispered compensation-he replied, "what could repay him for a ruined health," &amp;c. &amp;c. However, before the interview was over, Charles received a check upon a bank for five thousand dollars. Copeland began to think it was a hoax, but he knew an exposure would be disastrous to him, and his position, he being a married man, and moving as a religious character before society. Thus the pseudo Mr. and Mrs. Belville, were in possession of a large amount of money. They laughed most immoderately at the grand fleecing to which they had subjected Margaret's rich friend.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
                  <p>Not long after the affair with the rich Mr. Copeland, one of Margaret's numerous acquaintances begged permission to introduce one Monsieur Garamie, a French gentleman, to which request Margaret graciously consented, and the next evening Monsieur Garamie was introduced in due form. No sooner did he speak, than Margaret recognized in him, the man Fontainbleau, who had robbed her of so much money, at Toronto. She said nothing, However, but entertained him to the best of her ability, and when at length, the hour for dispersing arrived, she managed to whisper in his ear, to call on her the next morning at the hour of ten. He supposing that he had captivated her, felt highly flattered, and promised to be punctual at the hour. The next morning, at the hour of ten, he called upon her, and began to thank her in a bland tone for the compliment she had conferred upon him. She heard him to the end, and then in a cold tone, asked him how he had thrived upon the money he had so basely stolen from her at Toronto? He was struck with amazement at first, and could hardly believe it possible that she was Margaret. But he soon recovered himself, and held out his hand to her, which she refused at first to take. In another minute he pulled out a large calf skin wallet, and opening it, took therefrom a large roll of bills, and, handing them to her, said, "There is all the money I wronged you out of, and I freely return it with many thanks to you for the use of it, as it has been of great service to me; I have made more than ten thousand dollars by it." He also took a splendid diamond ring off his finger, and presented it to her, saying, "I hope you will now believe that I am not altogether forgetful of past favors," Margaret took both the roll of bills, and the jeweled ring, the latter of which, she put upon her finger, and then spreading out the money, she counted it; when, finding it all right, she felt softened towards him, and, holding out her hand, she said, "Come, let's make up, I own I judged you harshly," Fontainbleau took her hand and raising it to his lips, respectfully kissed it. They then talked over all that had befallen each other since they last met, and before they separated, he had so far won her, that she consented to leave Charles D. Ellas, and fly with him to New Orleans. So they-Fontainbleau and Margaret-assumed the names of Monsieur and Madame Lehocq, and hastened to leave Philadelphia for New Orleans, to carry out to the letter, their gigantic<pb n=""/> gambling scheme. Arrived there, they took a large house, and furnished it in the most gorgeous, and sumptuous manner. Soon their anticipations were more than realized. Things went along exceedingly well; money was rolled into the establishment, and Mrs. Lehocq was the centre of attraction. We should mention, here, that Madame Lehocq was the presiding goddess at the tables, but this of course, was only at the private tables; her wit was brilliant, and this was refreshed by wine; her education useful, and she knew well how to bring it prominently forward, whilst her refinement added a lustre to her queen-like beauty. Lehocq, or Fontainbleau, which even name the reader will recognize him by, was a tall, well-proportioned man, of about thirty-five years; of a very dark complexion, but of very red cheeks, though not vulgarly so; face rather long; he wore no whiskers, but a beard of a rather lighter cast than his very dark and glossy hair; well-proportioned nose, rather lengthy, and fine black eyes; his appearance was gentlemanly; his voice agreeable, and his manners like all other Frenchmen, extremely polished and fascinating. They prospered well, as we have before stated; that is, as far as their pecuniary means was concerned.</p> 
                  <p>Nothing worthy of note transpired for months, till one day in early spring they were both surprised by the sudden appearance among them, of Charles D. Ellas. Ellas had never known what had become of Margaret until then. By the merest chance in the world he stumbled upon them, and was quite as much surprised to see them both there as they were to see him. He pretended to care nothing about what had transpired, but inwardly resolved to possess himself of Margaret, and also revenge the wrong Lehocq had done him. He had not fully matured his plans when, the next evening, as they were discussing a bottle of champagne, both being quite inebriated, they commenced to quarrel like friends. Fontainbleau arose and struck Ellas a heavy blow in the face, and Charles pulling adroitly from under his sleeve a poniard, he made a desperate rush upon Fontainbleau and stabbed him several times, till he, bleeding from the many gaping wounds, fell to the floor, a corpse; and the drunken, infuriated murderer looked at the body in surprise and vexation, in remorse and terror, at his own bloody deed. This being all the work of a moment, Margaret stood lost-horror-stricken, and dumbfounded. She knew not whether to fly or stay; to lift the corpse of him who had been a husband to her, or fly upon him who had been in the same position towards her. She knew it would not do to raise an alarm, because Charles held the cord over her head as a terror. So they set about burying the body under the hearthstone of the kitchen. When this was accomplished Margaret feeling that suspicion would rest upon her as an accomplice in making way with her husband, as Lehocq was generally understood to be, determined to give up the establishment to Charles, and flee the city.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret gathered up all the loose valuables, and ready cash, which, with her jewels, amounted to a sum little short of twelve thousand dollars, (this was the price of her crime,) and hastened to secure a passage on board a vessel bound to Havana, which vessel weighed anchor shortly after she was on board, and away she went at the rate of ten knots per hour, towards the "gem of the Antilles,"-Cuba.</p> 
                  <p>We may as well just give the particulars of Charles's career in the Crescent<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5727-00000125"/> City. He soon deserted the order of things as they had been pursued at Lehocq's well regulated establishment, and turned it into a rendezvous for the greatest desperadoes, pickpockets and counterfeiters; these organized themselves into a body and converted the magnificent establishment, now owned by Charles, into their head-quarters, and made him treasurer. They called themselves "The Alumni;" they numbered thirteen at first, but soon swelled themselves into a band of one hundred and fifty-regular correspondence was kept up. They were the most desperate and formidable gang of ruffians ever associated-naught was too powerful nor too mean for their execution.</p> 
                  <p>They would rob from the person, break open a house, murder a family it necessary, or kill a man, on the hiring of an enemy. They would pass broken bank bills in the different sections where they were not known. Thus, a man in New York city would purchase all the notes on broken banks he could find, and these were dispatched to the different members of the Alumni, from the principal office at New Orleans. Regular accounts were kept against each gang; and each sub-division operated in a different quarter, under a leader. The business of the New Orleans department was to keep the different branches posted up in the excitements of the day, so that if any grand event was coming off, a deputation from the Alumni might be reckoned on. There is scarcely any desperate or extensive crime carried on, even to this time, that this band does not have connection with; while several are weekly being imprisoned in various parts of the Union. More converts are daily being made-the number is now over four hundred. They have been hunted from their New Orleans quarters, but are understood to branch out from the great Empire City, and even to the present day they evade all search and detection as a body. Secretly are their arrangements made, and its organization carried on. There is no branch of chicanery and maneuver that these desperate men are not awake to; they are composed of all nations-French, Swede, German, Russian, English, Scotch, and American. They are principally from the large cities on this and the European continent Their leader at the time we write, was Stew art McNulty-a deep, calculating, cunning, avaricious, and talented Scotchman. But as our business is not with the proceedings of the Alumni, in its midnight and noonday attacks upon the peace and property of society, we shall leave them to their course, and follow the subject of this narrative, the notorious Margaret C. Waldegrave.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
                  <p>Margaret in vain tried to sleep, though the night was tranquil as death; yet in her soul was chaos that, admitted of no rest. She arose from her couch, the most downy and voluptuous that the brilliant city of Havana could furnish, in which place she had been residing one month, and throwing around her a loose mantle, sallied forth. The gay city was at rest.<pb n=""/> A zephyr-like breeze bore away the perspiration from her brow, and she felt herself much refreshed. The moon-pale faced and bright, large and resplendent was standing tranquilly in the heavens, surrounded by a most gorgeous, serene and transparent sky. And now she looked at the fleecy clouds of ether which slowly seemed to pass along, how beautiful-how bright-how light were they. These were a contrast to her saddened and crushed heart of crime. Then turned she away and cast her eyes full in the faces of Phbus, the queen of the night; and that moon was to her like a changing face, which reflected first her mother, now her father-anon Florence's would be stamped upon its silvery surface, and he too would change into the murderous face of Grous; then would her child appear with its little eyebrows pursing at her, its mother! Oh! horror of horrors, this dissolving view, was a picture of misery! she tried to turn away but that dread fascination which often makes us look at sights that we would avoid, caused Margaret to look up to this ever changing moon. Now her poor, murdered child relaxed, and Madame Grous appeared with her wrinkled and sinful look. Next came Fontainbleau, with his cuts and bruises; he too would vanish into the smiling face of Lydia Bevington. She would desire him to stay for awhile that she might look upon the face, but no such pleasure was granted to her. She could gaze no longer, her eyeballs were scorching balls of fire. And then looked she upon the limpid stream beneath her feet, gushing, it seemed to cool her vision-but this was not for long, for while she was drinking in its magic beauties, it changed to a lake of BLOOD, She tried to drag herself from the spot, but it was vain-a thousand demon's strength seemed to hold her to it. Now turning her eyes towards the trees waving as they were-and rejoicing in most eloquent and natural music, she saw in the mingling of the leaves, a struggle between two deadly foes; and all Nature's simplicity and beauty seemed to her more dreadful than the painter's ideas of hell had ever realized on his canvass; till she could endure it no more, and throwing herself forwards, fell with a heavy weight, her full length upon the moistened grass. She had lain there some time when she was aroused from her dreams by a small voice which sounded like a flute-so sweet and genial was it to Margaret's ear.</p> 
                  <p>"Arise, woman," said the pleasant voice, in perfect Spanish, "this is no place for thee."</p> 
                  <p>"Art thou mortal, that you are wandering here," said Margaret looking at this strange apparition, as she thought it.</p> 
                  <p>"I am mortal, but soon I hope to be immortal," said the melodious voice, "I shall soon die and go to Heaven, I hope," and then, continued the musical voice, "whither art thou wandering? you too should go to Heaven."</p> 
                  <p>"Alas, I am too wicked," and the scalding tears fell thick and fast-uttered Margaret, in a suffocating voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, no," said the young girl, for such was the voice's embodiment, "but you are not prepared as I am-you are robust while I am, thank God! poor and wan, am I not?" this was asked as though an affirmative answer was desired most.</p> 
                  <p>"You are indeed very thin, and look as though you were fast going into another world," replied Margaret sympathetically.</p> 
                  <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5727-00000126"/> 
                  <p>"Thank you. I love you for that, for they all tell me I shall live. I shall die," and she clasped her almost transparent hands with joy-simply said the poor girl.</p> 
                  <p>"Where do you live?" said Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>"Here," said she, "all about these parts-this is all my home," said the fragile gazelle, casting her large eyes all round her. "How do you like my home?"</p> 
                  <p>"I like the grounds amazingly, but where is your house?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! old; you think I <emph>must</emph> live in a stone house. Oh, but I do not. I prefer a shaded tree on a summer night, and this arbour," pointing with her attenuated finger, "in winter."</p> 
                  <p>Margaret sighed, but questioned her, "Where is your food."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, I live upon fruit-do you love fruit? asked she of her new acquaintance.</p> 
                  <p>"I do, but not wholly," answered Margaret, "come said she, you have shown me your home, will you see mine?"</p> 
                  <p>"I will go, but do n't take me too far away, or my friends will miss me," answered the sickly girl.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you any friends-pray who are they?" asked Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, yes, I have many friends-every tree is peopled with them, and they prosper on every bush; my friends are the birds and the flowers. Who are your friends?" asked the girl.</p> 
                  <p>"Alas! I have no friends," said Margaret shedding tears.</p> 
                  <p>"Do n't cry; but you must be <emph>very</emph> miserable without friends, are you not," answered the flute-like voice, uttering a fearful though simple truth.</p> 
                  <p>"Will you be my friend," asked Margaret.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, yes. I'd like you for a friend, you are so lovely-but I cannot be with you always, for I must see my other friends; the birds would be very angry if I did not come to hear them sing."</p> 
                  <p>They soon arrived at Margaret's splendid dwelling, when the latter asked the poor consumptive lunatic girl her name. "They call me Jane, but my name is Violet, for the flowers call me that, and I know it is my true name."</p> 
                  <p>Margaret had her conveyed to a bedchamber beside her own-the poor girl was placed upon a bed, and there, from sheer exhaustion, fell asleep, probably the first time for weeks. Margaret slept soundly that night, and awoke refreshed, going into the girl's room, she found her up and walking about like a caged bird, still more death-like than before.</p> 
                  <p>"Ha," said she, "I'm not pretty, nor can I sing; so set me free, and I will pray for you up there," pointing upwards. "Indeed I am no bird. I am only the friend of birds," urged the girl.</p> 
                  <p>But Margaret soon introduced a doctor to her who know the child well, and said that she was the daughter of an Artist who had died of brain fever. Still she felt an interest in her, and wanted to adopt her as her natural offspring, but the medical man told her she would not live for another day. Violet became very calm and asked for a bird or two, and a flower to kiss and fondle, and when supplied with these wants folded them to her heart, then kissed them, and cried over them, and looking up, said, "The fountain of my eye is very refreshing to flowers-they flourish under it"</p> 
                  <p>In a few hours more, she took Margaret's hand, and told to prepare, for<pb n=""/> she and her friends were all going to Heaven; her head fell back upon the pillow, her face wore a gracious smile, and the painter's mad daughter was a corpse-though she looked the same in life. Her flesh and form was parian marble to the gaze. Margaret's disappointment was great at Violet's death, and felt that she had killed the wild plant by nursing it as an exotic. This was not so, the feeble frame of the mad girl was worn to the last. But Margaret was convinced in her mind, that her presence had withered the flower-her hand had been the death stroke to the girl, and for sometime she would pine and fret after her mad girl. Violet's death was a sad disappointment to Margaret, and it added another passion to her number-another grief to sour her life.</p> 
               </div> 
               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <p>Margaret had by this time resided three years in the city of Havana, before any event of note occurred in her checkered career. She had led a reformed life. Her fortune was competent to maintain her in plenty. She had a comfortable residence, and nothing now marred her peace, save her night dreams, which were often of the most horrible character, and conscience, which Shakspeare has said, "makes cowards of us all," certainly beat down the spirit, impetuous, turbulent, and irascible as it once was.</p> 
                  <p>We will not attempt an analysis of her character at this time. "She was tired of blood," and would fain have given up her worldly possessions and her physical charms, for an honest, innocent mind. Others prided themselves that they knew the world-she cursed the time that she became familiar with it. She would have exchanged looks with the most wrinkled visage of hideous age, or the penury of the street beggar, if she could have made herself a woman whose hands were not stained with blood. Margaret's loneliness made her thoroughly miserable, and she knew not what to do, where to find relief, or how to secure it. The walls of her rooms were to her eyes a panorama of her vicious life, from her cradle to this woful zenith of life. Her bed was a sea of tortures. Every angle brought a victim or a criminal associate to her face. Her pillow tossed her upon thorns, and her dreams were as horrible as hell itself. All that a dreadful, sinful life could conjure up, was there. She would start and stare, and the heavy perspiration would stand on her in drops of anguish, while she thought-and think she must. Oh that she could have plucked out her brains, and made herself a living carcass, a moving empty thing, with words, but no <emph>thoughts</emph>. Crime indeed brings-its own rewards. Charity may cover a multitude of sins; yes, minor ones, we grant, but not cruel, foul and unnatural murder. Nothing can wipe this out. No-not if religion be true, and there be a hell, and it is a place of scorpions, devils, and inexplicable tortures; surely to such must blood-stained minds come at last.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret now commenced to write her life; every day seemed to add to<pb n="264-265 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5727-00000127"/> the bulk of this book, and as it was written upon the paper, it seemed as though her heart grew lighter and happier; it was a load taken off her incubus-burthened mind. But still there was no real relief for her. Thoughts bowed down by grief, and a soul living in dread of itself, is no light or pleasant companion. Margaret at once found that all hopes of finding relief in a secluded life were a delusion and a snare, and so she made one deep and dreadful plunge into the excitement of fashionable life, excitement and entertainment, hoping thereby to dissipate all the devils that haunted her. Her house was opened to the gayest of the gay of the Cuban metropolis. Gambling was carried on to a powerful extent, but so far as Margaret was concerned, without any business profit. Her "salons" were opened to the most fashionable, and were more universally eulogized than any others in this region of pleasure, dissipation, and amusement.</p> 
                  <p>Among the persons who paid Margaret the most attention, was Signior Cordoval, a wealthy Spaniard, who had just arrived from the mother country, and was supposed to be connected with a secret diplomatic mission from the court of Madrid. He played very recklessly, but generally won. His companion was a Pierre Dupont, an accomplished French gentleman, with plenty of means, and the heart to risk them. These men were two members of "the Alumni," and had contrived by watching, to observe where Margaret had concealed her wealth, and planned the means of robbing her. This was to be done when the saloons were filled with company. But they found more assistance was necessary than themselves; and their rough and hardy companions who were in the city were not adapted to such a superior branch of the profession, and Lorenzo and Paul, after due deliberation, determined to send on for the best member that the Alumni could boast or spare. A letter was dispatched accordingly to head-quarters for help. In the meanwhile Lorenzo continued unremitting in his attentions, and Margaret seemed well pleased with his society. But as the latter knew that rogues might appear in good clothing, she kept a sharp and vigilant look over all her visitors; and her suspicions were aroused when she caught Pierre trying to get a wax imitation of the key of her closet, which was carelessly left on the table. But Margaret seemed not to notice it, and continued to receive Lorenzo as one of her more favored guests. The Havana branch of the Alumni received a letter from the head-quarters, that McNulty was off east on some important affairs, but that Ellas would soon be along; and shortly afterwards arrived in the city Mr. Charles D. Ellas, whose career commenced and seemed almost inseparable from Margaret's, and who had progressed or digressed so remarkably in their deeds, that their names will ever be remembered as two of the worst criminals of society. Margaret, in the meanwhile, removed all her money from where she had previously concealed it. She received Charles very coldly, and great surprise was manifested in both their actions and behavior when in the gay and brilliant drawing room their eyes first met. The company perceived nothing strange in this. It was a re-uniting of old friends. Cordoval and Dupont were both there, but their hearts fell when they saw that their treasurer was recognized by the lady herself. Margaret, with that quick perception which characterizes those who have long been acquainted with<pb n=""/> 
                     <figure> </figure>
                     <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5727-00000128"/> such robberies, mastered all the secrets of the affair, understanding, at one thought, that Charles had been sent for to engage her while the robbery was to be committed in another part of the house. Our lady fell, or seemed to fall into the snare most directly, for she even proposed herself, that she and Charles should go out to a country seat she had taken and furnished for the summer, in the suburbs of Havana, about half a mile from the metropolis, beside a beautiful stream. The place is called the Chateau de Berrien, for Margaret still assumed the French character.</p> 
                  <p>When they had arrived, Charles admired the beauty of the building and its arrangements, as he thought once more of becoming Margaret's partner; but she hated him for the murder of Fontainbleau. When he was reclining upon the sofa, Margaret approached him, and embracing him with one arm, she drew secretly, from beneath the ample sleeves of her magnificent dress, a poniard, and ran it into the heart of Charles. He shrieked, tried to rise, but it was vain; the blood came so fast that he could not assuage it, and he lay upon the sofa, in a bath of his own blood, while Margaret, whose looks had become terrible with rage, and whose beauty seemed to render her blood-bespattered countenance more hideous and revolting, was standing over him. "Charles," shouted Margaret, "I have had my revenge. I preserved you for my own revengeful spirit. Your friends are not alone disappointed in their money adventure, but are now charred and mangled corpses." He groaned. "That groan is a payment for your treachery. You-whom I have befriended and helped-you were the one that treacherously conspired with Dupont and Cordoval, to rob me of my last cent, and if necessary, you would have murdered me; but the tables are now turned, and my old schoolfellow,"-and she grinned with the ferocity of a tigress-"is now my victim." Charles was trying to staunch the blood, but it spirted all over the room, and Margaret laughed, fiend-like. "Your friends I have blown up by means of gunpowder. You see, my dear Charles, that when I learned it was the intention of your band to rob me, I removed the cash"-another laugh-"and strewed the room with torpedoes and gunpowder, which of course exploded, the moment they placed their feet upon them. Hark! what was that?" and a thundering sound, like an earthquake, rent the air, a horrid light of an explosion illuminated the chamber, and Charles was a corpse.</p> 
                  <p>Margaret looked at him, and as she was viewing with mingled degrees of satisfaction, awe, and horror, a thundering knock came at the door. It was several police officers, who, passing by the Chateau de Berrien, were attracted by groans. Margaret trembled; but so horror-stricken had she become, that when the officers had battered in the door, and had her confined between them, she had not recovered herself; and it was only on the morrow, that Margaret remembered the events of her last murder. The horrors of Castle Moro, with its heavy stone chambers, blank and dark cells, and heavy black window bars, soon awoke her to a sense of her dreadful position.</p> 
                  <p>It was not long after her arrest, before she was brought out for trial, and much pity and commiseration were felt for her by all who saw her; and one Senor Narciso, a member of the Havana bar, undertook her defence; and most ably did he defend her to the last. But all his efforts were in<pb n=""/> vain. The terrible facts were too glaring to admit of any doubt as to her guilt in the minds of the judges, and she was convicted of the foul murder of Charles D. Ellas, Lorenzo Cordoval, and Pierre Dupont, and sentenced to be publicly garoted, in Plaza Square, July 9th, 1852.</p> 
                  <p>After the sentence was pronounced, she was taken back to her cell in old Moro, and bade prepare for eternity. Seeing that no hope remained but that she must die an ignominious death, she became partially reconciled to her fate, and consented to receive a reverend father of the Catholic church, as a spiritual adviser.</p> 
                  <p>Friday, July 9th, the day fixed upon for her execution, at length dawned upon Havana. It was a clear, cloudless day, and at an early hour every body was astir, for since the garoting of Lopez, nothing worthy of note had transpired to create an excitement equal to this. By 9 A. M., every avenue to the scaffolding, on which was to be enacted the bloody scene, was filled by an eager multitude, whose animal propensities incited them to feast their greedy eyes on the horrid spectacle. Fair senoritas, and brave cavaliers, lined the streets, and occupied every eligible position at the windows, and upon the house-tops. At length the dread procession began to move from the Castle Moro, toward the plaza, preceded by a file of Castilian soldiers, having Margaret, who was attended by a minister, in their midst. Oh! it was a grand, but sad spectacle! and as it moved along in solemn silence, many a heart that beheld it, quaked with fear. The soldiers, gaudily dressed in crimson and gold, mounted on proud, neighing, prancing steeds, which pawed the ground in disdain, while the sun reflected the burnished steel arms borne by the soldiery, gave the street the appearance of a molten sea of silver.</p>

                  <p>Arriving at the scaffolding, Margaret, in a sable colored dress, ascended the platform in a languid manner, supported by the executioner. She then knelt down, while her face was ashy pale, and received a benediction, after which, she was raised up by the executioner, and placed in the fatal chair. Soon the cold iron collar was placed around her neck, and she was fastened to the fatal post, the deadly screw was turned, the cold steel penetrated the spine, and in a moment she was a hideous corpse. Margaret, the once beautiful and accomplished woman, was dead. She had outraged the laws, both human and divine. Man had made her pay the penalty for breaking his laws, and sent her to stand her trial before the Great Judge of divine law. Who shall say what the <choice>
