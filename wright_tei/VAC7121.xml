THE following pages have been written during the inter- vals of a busy life, engrossed by duties, many of which have brought me into more or less close contact with some of the scenes I have endeavored to describe. In thinking over the causes that involve much of the action and reaction, the ebb and the flow, the joys and the sorrows of our modern American Society, it appeared to nme that they had scarcely been adequately described by any native writer of fiction. I of course do not include such short stories of Far West- ern Mining Life as those which have recently made Bret Harte's name famous, or that delineation of strictly eastern manners and morals in Mrs. Beecher Stowe's "Old Folks at Home " ; but these are in their very nature exceptional extracts, as it were, froml the book of life, rather than glances at the more fiequently observed portraits scattered through the whole volume. Eventually the omission will doubtless be supllied by a host of authors, for the novel has now, to a great and increasing degree, invaded the field of the pamlli- let, the disquisition, and the essay, and I can see no valid reason why the American soil should 'not, be as favorable to  &#xD;<pb n="vi-vii (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7121-00000004"/> vi          PREFACE. its culture as that of Eur6pe. It is true that we have not tile gorgeous tints to be drawn from courts and their sur- roundings, or the peculiar complexities of situation presented by the wide differences between classes still perceptible upon that side of the Atlantic; bult human nature is the same every- where, and " they who cross the seas change their skies but but not their minds." Here, moreover, owing to the greater absence of conventionality, the passions have freer scope. Malice and 1.Envy, Avarice and Vanity, are here perhaps more unblushing than in older communities, and in the due har- mony of creation their opposite virtues, Charity and Love, Generosity and R etiring Modesty, are in an equal degree stronger, more life-like, and more influential; again, for all a novelist misses in the different ranks of society in Europe, lhe can find compensation in the great religious and social questions that in a comparatively new country are more vigorous ald promiinent than in an old. These oDportunities of contrast, incident, and thought, I have attempted to utilize, and if in the impartial judgment of the reader I have at all contributed to forward good work in my generation, my labors will have been well repaid, and my reward be ample.

So sweet a iiss the golden sun gives not To those fresh mornilg d(rops upon the rose, As thy eye beams, whenv their fresh rays have smote The dew of nilht that on my cheeks do\wn flows. Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright Through the tranllparent botom of the deep, As doth thy face through tears of mine give light; Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep. No drop but as a coach doth carny thee; So ridest thou triumphing in my woe, Do but baehold the tears that swell in me, And they thy glory through my grief will show. But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep My tears for glasses, and still make me weep. O queen of queens! how far thou dost excel, No thought can think, no tongue of mortal tell. SHAKESPEARE. THE balmy atmosphere; the rich green grass; the trees in their fresh raiment of new leaves; the fields budding with the forecast of the coming harvest; the birds, flitting from branch to branch, singing and chirping vivaciously as they flew-all these and a huh-  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7121-00000006"/> dred other welcome signs, proved that the dreary winter was at an end, and the merry spring, with all its promises, blossoming again for the children of men. There is a sense of relief to the farmer and the- shepherd, to the merchant and the banker-all alike rejoice to see the long iron winter at an end, 'and flowers and tender leaves growing green, and fresh, and beautiful, where, but a few weeks ago, field and garden and meadows were veiled in broad sketches of cold frozen snow. The landscape was lovely indeed, and the young cattle, browsing in the meadows, added a new charm to a picture the noblest artist living might have been proud to paint. Sud- denly a shrill whistle was heard, as a train rapidly emerged from a woody brake, bounding the view in the back-ground, and, with all the privileges of our craft, we will peep into one of the cars, and introduce the reader at once to two of the occupants. "In ten minutes, if nothing happens, our train will reach the depot, and then we shall soon arrive at our snug home," said a young man, hopefllly and cheerfully, to a lady of pre- possessing appearance, who shared the same seat in the car, and folndly nestled her head on his manly arm, looking lovingly up to his beautiful, frank, and open countenance, but made no remark. C Are you not glad, dear?" " cannot say that I am, for our wedding tour has not been so extended as I expected. I, did not wear one-third of my wardrobe," answered the lady despondingly. "I must express my regret at your disappointment. Still, if you reflect, and take into consideration that it is ten weeks to-day since we left home, have visitedl the principal cities and places of note, and are both fatigued froin travel, it is reasonable that we should return to our cozy home, and be among tlosC who long to sec us, anld wiLth whom we love to live."    cU, U' DFESTINY.        I I The train reached a tunnel, and 'the young couple im- proved the opportunity to exchange ardent kisses. The en- gine again gave a loud whistle, and in a few seconds halted at the depot, where all was bustle and excitement, with the arrival and departure of passengers. "Be carefil, dear! Don't jump from1 those high steps. Let me help you; and the young husband lifed his wife wilt as much ease as if she had been aIn infant. "Thank you, Otto; how strong .you are!" 'exclaimed the wife with a smile.   , "Love makes strong," replied the husband. They reached the grand entrance of the depot; the wife looked wistfully at the long row of carriages; a shade of deep disappointment passed over her handsome face, and she ex- claimeld in a regretfiul tone, "' Why, I1 don't see my ma's carriage. How shall we reach our homcle? ' Very easily and pleasantly," answered the husband promptly. "I will hire a hack." "Mr. Wehien, I amr not used to ridin(g in a hack in my native city," said the young wife, somewhat sharply. "Viola, I am aware of it; but you must remember that your husband is not able to support a cariage, and therefore must be contented to ride in a hack, and what is good enough for the h1usband, must be good enough for the wife, or vice versa; " and without another word, he motioned to a driver of the handsomest hack in the row, assisted his wife gracefully to a seat, and ordered the driver to take them to No. 214 Rox Street. '"Rox Street, did you say?" "Yes, dear."  I never heard of Rox Street. Where is Rox Street-what kind of a street is it?" asked Mrs. Otto Wehlen in quick succession. "Rox Street is situated in the northern part of the city.  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7121-00000007"/> It is a new street, fifty feet broad, on high grounds, from which the largest part of the city and river can be seen. The scenery is charming. I hope that you will like the spot that I have selected as our future home." I hope I shall, but I have my misgivings." "Why have misgivings?  "Because I desire to reside on a fashionable street, where there is a good neighborhood." Rox Street is not what is called a fashionable street, but I vouch that it has a good neighborhood," returned the hus- band earnestly. The carriage now turned and ascended a somewhat hilly, but well-paved street, adorned with young trees carefully encased, to protect them in their infancy from rude hands. "You see, dear, this is Rox Street," exclaimed Mr. Otto Wehlen, watching with great anxiety to see what impression the street would make on his wife, who leaned forward to view the street as the coach passed on. She made no remark, and with a sigh threw herself back in her seat. The carriage stopped, the young husband alighted briskly, and affectionately extended his arms to assist his wife, who mechanically accepted his attention. He paid the fare, and turning to his wife anxiously asked "How do you like the appearance of our house? does it not look cozy?" "The stable at my father's house is grander than' the house you propose as my home," answered the young wife in a dejected tone. The husband looked disappointed, and remarked: "I did not aim to have a grand, but a comfortable house, and I hope that you will find it so." He quickly opened the front door, which led to a broad hall that ran through the entire building. In the centre of the hall was a comfortable stair- way with a heavy banister, lit from the top by a skylight. "You see, dear, on the first floor is the parlor, reception   OR, OUR DES7TINY.  and diling rooms, kitchen and servantss' roomn; up-stgais, four rooms and bath rooml; drying and storerooms are col- nected with the kitchen by dum lb waiters; a good cellar be- neath the entire building ; all well ventilatedt ; and the waste water connected withl the drain. This house is built on a natural bed of gravel, which absorbs the damp." Pray, what else can you say in its favor?" ( What else?" answered the husband with a smile. "That each roonm has a separate entrance from the all; it can, therefore, be kept in good order with less exertion ; and by opening the front and rear window of the hall, there is a cur- rent of firesh air which will be beneficial to the health of its occuplants." And he continued, "Please step to the front window and look in the direction of the city. Does it not appear like a panorama--the river like a mirror? and you see those forest-covered hills; they not only look clarming, but they waft us on their wing of the wind invigorating kisses. It is delightful scenery, i it not, dearest?" "It is,' ans;wered the wife, condiesccndinl^y ; but look at this street, There is not one ston-front buiiil ding onl t1he AV1o1e1 Square; n oth, in T 1 lwhole square; nothing b1ut brick, and even frame buildiltgs, filisignificant alpi)earance, no doubt inhabited by ieoDle who are as insigniflicant as the premises they occupy. ,  You are greatly mistaken. Very eminent people live in those houses that you are pleased to call insignificant. One is occupied by a judge of the suplreme court, who is a icor- ruptible as he is able and just. In the next house adjoining -residles an autthor of several standard works, w1hose wise say ings have become hollsclhold words through0lout the land, In almost every house lives eithler a man of lettes or. a man of art that lhas mlastered his calling. Those are worthy neigh- bors, and that induced me to make in this street my home." "They may be nice people, but they are not fashionable, remarked the wife pensively.,    &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7121-00000008"/> "   TIIE FORGIVING KISS;" " "You are right. An upright judge is getting to be very much out of date. Fashionable judges live in fashionable streets; so do fashionable bank tellers, and fashionable cash- iers, but judes, clerks, and cashiers, with old-fashioned principles of integrity, have no desire to live on fashion- aile streets. To them, a street like Rox Street is good enough; and'if you love me as you profess, then make no frther objection to the streetand the house I have chosen as our future residenwce. "  I ndeed, Mr. Wehilen, if there is any one who has a right to doubt the sincerity of love, it is I ; for no husband who loves his wife will rent or buy a hduse before first showing it to his wife, and consulting her wishes. It is unreasonable for you to expect that I, the daughter of Mrs. John JaJmes I . Monte, who is a born Bottwell, should be content to live on Rox Street, and in such a house as this."  ";I admit, it would have been proper for me to have con-i sutilted you before buying this property, but it was offered to me while we were on our wedding tour. The house was fully dscribed to me, and a complete list sent of the families re- siding in the neighborhhood, whom I personally knew to be honorable. The price o f the property came within my means; I bouight it, had it completely furnished, and expected that Dyou would be delighted to find on our arrival our house ready for us to occupy and go to housekeeping. I feel keenly disappointed that you are not pleased with my choice, and hope that you will change your opinion and-" "No, never, never," interruptd the wife with great energy. "4A daoughter of Mrs. John James ILa Monte, who is a born Bottwell, cannot be content to reside on Rox Street, and in such a house." Is  a aware that you are a odaughter of Mrs. John James Ia Monte who is a born Bottwell, but you are now more than that--you are the wife of an honest man, and an honest man   ON, OUR/ DESTIN Y.        15 is the noblest work of God. To remain honest, I must live within my income, and, as a good wife, you will assist me to retain justly that great title, 'ani hons'l mans.' We must prac- tise economy, and remember the maxim, a 'penny saved is a penny earned.' In economy there is safety; in extravagance ruin-" "Pray do not continue your remarks," pleaded the wife; "there is no poetry in them." "Perhaps there is more truth than poetry in what I say- and the truth is so unfashionable ; but, dear, we must not aim to be a fashionable couple, but a truthful one: true to our- selves, to God, and toward our fellow-men. Then only can we expect to lead a happy life. In vanity, outward show, and extravagance, there is danger that we shall not remain true to ourselves, God, and our fellow-men. The mind will be too much occupied with the body; the spirit-that better self of man-will be neglected, and the prospects are that we will find ourselves, in our old days, poor in means, poor in love, and poor in spirit.- Can there be anything poorer than sucl an old couple! We should be objects of pity, with none to pity us, for we should have idled away the fair chances of life. No, we must aim to do our best not to become such a couple." While uttering these words, he withdrew a gold locket from his breast, touched a secret spring, which opened the locket and represented the tablets of the ten commandments on which those matchless laws were engraved, while on the reverse were three capital letters-"S. S. S." Behold, my dear wife, these tablets. They contain the ten commandments, which are no doubt engraved on your heart. Add to these commandments my three symbolic S's -Self-Reliance, Self-Denial, and Self-Culture. These com- mandments, and this motto-S. S. S.-have made me what I am, honored and beloved by those who know me best." :?  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7121-00000009"/> The young wife listened, but she was more attracted by the glittering jewel than by the words of her husband. "What a beautiful contrivance this is!" said she in a win- ning tone. "Please let me have it. I will wear it." I do not like to part with it. It is the gift of a very dear friend ; but you can have it. Wear it, and profit by its great lessons. May it prove to you an armor to shield you from peril. Let it be to you a talisman in that sense." "I accept it, and will cherish it as such," replied the wife, placing the souvenir within her bosom. Quickly withdrawing it, she exclaimed, "No! before I keep this syymbol near my heart, I must know who that dear friend is from whom you- received it." His name is Julius Solomon, a nobleman by nature, and whom I honor for his excellent worth.. He is a scion of that race whose ancestors were prophets, princes, and heroes. I delight in his friendllhip. -He is an intellectual giant, and lacks not a good heart." "And of whom did he get this novel charm?" "He told miie that it is a family heirloom. For centuries it has been handed firom father to son. Soime of his relatives. claim that it has adorned that good Queen Alexandra." "It is strange that he should have parted with-it," ob- servedl tihe wife, replacing the jewel within her bosom. He gave it to ince before he started for Europe, there to complete his professional studies. No doubt gratitude in- duccd himL to present it to me, for I assisted him pecuniar- ily, to enable him to master his calling. Gratitude is one of the lpromineCnt traits of his character. He would have felt of- fended had I not accepted the jewel as a memento. You will treasure it dearly, will you not, dearest?" asked the hus- and, affectionately. It shall always be near to my heart," answered the wife promptly.   I7 "And will you also vividly remember what is engraved there? All civilized nations, all races, and all creeds ac- knowledge their obligation, and none can be happy in this world or the next who neglect their precepts. My darling, guard this talisman in your heart of hearts, and the lessons it teacles will guard you now and forever. Look now on the other side, and there you will see my symbolic mottoes- S. S. S.---Self-reliance, Self-denial, and Self-culture." "I will," answered the wife, tears gathering in her eyes at the earnest appeal of her husband. "Then let us seal the promise with a kiss." "Not one, but three: one for each symbolic letter," cried the young wife. At each kiss the husband exclaimed, "Self-reliance, Self- denial, Self-culture--these are the safe-guards of a married life. Let us practice them sincerely, and God will be with us here and hereafter." "Amen!" exclaimed a voice full of tenderness. Both looked and exclaimed, "Mother!" "My children!" exclaimed the nother, embracing and kiss. ing them afifectionately; and looking at them with admniring eyes, sad, You both look splendidly. Marriage seems to agree with you. How happy I am to see you at home, and looking so vell. I observed the carriage passing my house, and had a glimpse of Viola. I became so nervous from joy that it took me longer than usual to dress. I came in, and felt delighted to hear Otto explain his symbolic S. S. S. Those are great words. May you live up to them, and I am quite sure that happiness will be your reward. By the way, a law- yer brought a large sealed envelope to my h1ou1s, and re- quested me to hand it to you immediately upon your arrival, as it is very important, relating to your land adjoining the Grand i Park."  With these words Mrs. Wehlen placed her hand in her pocket, but found no envelope there. "Wat?  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7121-00000010"/> not in my pocket I' exclaimed she in alarm. "I must eithel have lost it on my way, or left it in my house;" and she quickly left the room. The door-bell rang, and the young husband hastened to answer the call. "Is this Number 214?" asked a man roughly. "Yes, sir." "Then let's have your checks for your trunks. Three of them are big enough to contain an elephant apiece." "Here are the checks, and a dollar for yourself. Bring the trunks up to the rooms. You baggage men have a way of carrying a trunk with case. You will find those large trunks to be light; they contain ladies' dresses." "Yes, yes," said the man pleasantly. The dollar he felt in his palm made a wonderful difference in his nature. 'The trunks being safely brought to the rooms, the master of the house unlocked them,- and began to assort the contents. "Don t, dear, touch those clothes," exclaimed the young wife, "You will spoil them; they must be handled with great care."  "Well, then, I will only put away my own clothes, and you, dear, in the meantime, go and prepare some breakfast, for I am actually hungry." I! to go and cook the breakfast?" asked the wife with astonishment. "Of course ; it is the duty of the wife to prepare the meals. Who else should do it?" "Employ a girl, or let mother come and cook." ( Employ a girl-the right girl-is easier said than done, It is best to mIanage without one. As for mother to cook for us is entirely out of the question, for I consider it very unreasonable to have our mother to wait on us. Filial love requires us to treat our mothers as our honored guests, and not as our servants."   "J, u UK 'S7J^2v yg "Indeed, Otto, you are too flowery in your filial views toward your mother. She will think nothing of it, to do the cooking for us. It will be a pleasure to her, and very pleas. ant to m1e." "But not to me, for I have a contempt for those young ladies who pass their time in making their toilettes, for hours rocking or gossiping with their neiglbors, while the Dmother has to do the work they should do themselves, and many a mother brleaks down under the exertion, and often shortens the days of her natural life. No i thrice no! my wife shall not be one of those young ladies, who make a pack-horse of their mlother." "Mr. Wehlen, you alarm me. Don't speak so excitedly." "Excuse me, if I have spoken with so much energy; but really, to my mind, there is nothing more unreasonable than for full-grown young people to allow the aged and feeble to wait on them ; and they to take it as a matter of course. Such young people deserve the contempt of every honorable man and woman. You, mly darling, shall not belong to that class. You will be a model wife, who is self-relying. Now please go and prepare the morning imeal, and if mother comes she shall be our guest." - This was said with so much earnestness and tenderness, that the young wife briskly stepped into the kitchen to cook the first meal for her husband. She rolled up her sleeves, opened the stove, filled it fll with paper, kindling wood, and coal, lit a match and applied it to 'the paper, but it would not burn. The stove was too full, and thus obstructed the draft. 'OlOh dear; ,me!" ex- claimedl she ; "this paper and this wood will not kindle. What shall I do to make them burn? Otto is hungry, and I too feel as if I wanted my breakfast." She lit match after match, but it would not kindle. She became angry, and wrung her hands in despair. "Let le look into the cupboard.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7121-00000011"/> 20      c TIiT FORGIVING KISS;"  Perhaps there is a can of petroleum. I will pour it upon this coal, wood, and paper. I am sure it will burn then.' She looked into the cupboard; it contained a barrel of flour, a box of sugar, a bag of coffee, a tin box of tea, smoked beef and tongue, sardines, cans of oysters and other delicacies. "Everything seems to be here, except what I need most-a can of petroleum or kerosene oil. I will send my husband for some." She stepped in the hall, and called pleasantly," Otto, Otto dear, please come down." "I am coming. What do you want, dearest?" "I cannot start the fire in the stove, and there is no pe- troleum in the house. I want you to go to the nearest gro- cer and send some." Gracious! Viola, you do not mean to use petroleum in kindling a fire in the stove. You run a risk of burning to death, and having an explosion besides," observed the hus- band gently. ' Let me see where the difficulty is." He examined the stove, and said, ( I see you did not place the paper and wood properly, and you put too much coal on the top. Take out the coal and wood, and 1 will show you how a fire is kindled in the stove quickly." He took his penknife and a piece of wood, which he commenced to cut into small, thin pieces. "O, dear me, what a work this is!" sighed Viola. "How one soils the hands." "Whalt of it? there is plenty of water and soap," said the husband good-naturedly. "I know there is, but when I was single I was not obliged to make a fire and cook; and you do not even in- tend to employ a servant girl. I think we had better give up housekeeping, and board in some fashionable boarding- house." "It is a great pity that among your accomplishmiltets you' did not acquire the art of kindling a fire and cooking a   OR, OUR DESTINY 21 meal. If you could coo/k, we could do without a servalt girl. 0We could hire a person, who would come once or twie a veek, do the wa shing, and assist in ironing, and do the rough scrubbin But I do not give it upyet.

No, my dear, we will have a home of our own, and we will have it as we will make it. Servant girls are often great disturbiung elements in a family; therefore, self-re. liance!

She listened to all that her hus- band said, and watched with admiring eyes how easily he lit the fire.  She too wanted t o O something toward prepar- "ing the morning meal. She took the coffee-pot and filled it brimful with water, and Was in the act of placing it on the "That is not right, Viola; you have too much water in the pot.

Then only, and only then, can we justly expect to be free of op- pressing cares, and feel secure against poverty in our old days." "You seem to think the management in the kitchen is of the greatest importance." "I most assuredly do; as well-prepared food is essential for the preservation of good health, and without good health and economy it is almost impossible to achieve success, and accumulate property. That secures us a certain independ- ence that keeps the wolf fromn the door. But what shall we have for breakfast? I have almost a headache firom hunger, and you, dear, look pale. A good breakfast would do you good," exclaimed-the husband. "IWell, what shall we have for breakfast?

I did not then have to trouble myself with kinidling a fire in the stove, preparing the breakfast, and listening to a lecture on cooking and economy.

Earth will then be a paradise, and you would not change your position of a beloved wife and mother for that of a duchess.,"  A violent ringing of the door-bell was heard. The bus- band hurried to answer the urgent call, when, opening the door, his nother-in-law Mrs. John James La Monte, ap- peared, very excited; he greeted her respectfiily and affec. tionately; but se aid no attentio to him, and asked in a cor(mmanding tone, "Sir, where is my daughter?  iViola heard the voice, rushed from the kitchen to her mother's arinms and exclaimed, My mother!'

Mri' Otto Wehlen, did you hear what I have said, that I will never consent that mIzy daughter should reside on Rox Street?

The houses on this street are built on solid ground, while Jiger Place lies low in the valley, and the dwellings are built on ground made from the refuse of the streets. Jiiger Place, though very fashionable, is very unhealthy." "That is a trumped-up objection. I do believe  or of it," interrupted Mrs. La Monte. "The statistics will show that more children die on J:ger Place than in any other part of the city," rejoined the son- in-law promptly. ' An what of it? Children re  ble. It is not fash- ionable to have children." "Children may be a trouble, and be unwelcome to the fashionable people of our day, but to menof my concption of life they are a pleasure and a blessing, for every child is of life they are a plteasure F a        that recognized by them as a fresh plcdge of the covenant that exists between God and imen.

That requires patience and enduring exertions, which the fashionable are too fashionable to bestow ; hence, children are to them a trouble, and declared unfashionable; but is it not wrong? What would your own life be to-day without children? Even I, humble as I am, would not for a 1moment pause to con- verse with you, for a woman that calls scientific mechanics, upright judges, autaors, and men of letters, 'nobodies,' bcacuse they are limited in wealth, has a very vague com- prehension of real worth and--" "And you mean to say that I owethe honor of hearing your views to my daughter," again interrupted Mrs. La Monte, growing still more excited. "Pardon me, you do," was the ready response. Mrs. La Monte looked astonished, and meditated. What   OR, OUR?

I must humble him. I must bring him to his knees before me. He must be my slave, and feel my power that can make or crush him. All this passed through her mind like a flash of lightning, and her angry look became veiled with a smile. "Indeed," said she, pleasantly, "I am -very glad to see that you place such high value on yourself that you consider it a condescension to even speak to me." She laughed sarcastically, and continued in a pleasant tone and man- ner, "Put really you ought to do something to please the mother of your beautiful wife. You ought to con- sent to reside on some more fashionable street than Rox Street." "You should indeed," added Viola. "I will take it into consideration, and commnunicate to. ! you my conclusion at some future day." "No; you must decide at once to move from this street. If you have objections to Jliger Place, then make your home on Clinton Heights. It has the most charming resi- dences on the continent," pleaded the mother-in-law. "Mst!" rejoined the son-in-law; "must is a dictatorial word, which I only recognize under pressing circumstances I see no cause why I must decide so quickly, on such aa im- portant matter. I prefer to have the subject under considera- tion. As for making Clinton Heights my future residence, it is not advisable." "And may I ask why?" "I have several reasons." "And they are-?" asked the mother-in-law quickly. "I prefer not to state them," answered the young husband thoughtfully.    &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7121-00000014"/>  "As a good husband and a good son-in-law, you should state the reasons why you object to make your home on Clinton Heights, for I am sure that your wife would be delighted with Clinton Heights. Am I not right, Viola?" "Yes, ma, it would be so grand." "Too grand!" exclaimed the husband; and turning to his wife, he said affectionately, "Dear, let us be content to live where we are. It would be fatal to our happiness to move into those fashionable quarters. Here we will live undisturbed in our love, and our love embraces the whole world, Jaiger Place and Clinton Heights included. Free from cares, free from outward show, and free from envy, we shall have time to observe the grandeur of nature, and see God revealed a thousandfold. We will recognize Him in our hearts, as the lispenser of all that is good, as the father of all, and we will endeavor to become His worthy children. Kiss me, dearest, and promise that you will be content to give this home at least a trial." He outstretched his arms with an appealing look. The young wife threw herself into the outstretched arms, kissed her husband fervently and exclaimed, "I will! I will!" "You will not," ejaculated the mother-in-law, tearing hus- band and wife apart, with the fury of an enraged tigress. "You will not make such a promise. I will not allow you to live in this house. The house and the street are not good enough for my daughter. It may answer for some mechanic, a tradesman, or some old fogy of a book-worm, but for a grandchild of the Bottwells it will not do. If you, sir, have t not the means to provide a better home for my daughter, you should admit it, and I, as her mother, will assist you. Here is a roll, containing thirty thlousand dollars in coupons,  being six per cent. interest on my five-twenty bonds, and if  this is not sufficient to buy a home on Clinton Heights, then   OR, OUR DESTzY.         27 I will give you the same amount of coupons, which you can collect six months hence." Mrs. La Monte expected that her son-in-law would accept the handsome present with joy, a shower of thanks, and gratitude; but she was disappointed. He said in the most dignified mannier, "Thank you; Otto Wehlen accepts no gifts." If a thunder-bolt had fallen down from a clear sky before Mrs. John James La Monte, it could not have more sur- prised and terrified her than the words and manner of her son-in-law. She looked at him with mingled surprise and contempt, and asked herself, "What does this poor young man mean? Has he lost his senses, not to accept thirty- no, sixty thousand dollars in American gold coin? No; he is right in his mind. He wishes to be coaxed, before he accepts my princely gift." Recovering her self-command, she addressed him thus: "You cannot be in earnest in re- fusing 1my offer of means to buy a home for yourself and wife. Take it; I can easily spare it." "No, I thank you. I have a home which I consider good enough for my wife and myself. If you can spare that sulm so easily, spend it for charitable purposes." "Charity should begin at home,' " responded the mother- in-law. A flash of anger mantled over the face of the young hus- band at those cutting words, and he exclaimed with great energy, "' Thank God that I am no object of your charity! Please let us change the subject. How is my father-in-law? how is Rosalind? and have you received any letters from WTinfr-ed?"' "No, I will not change the subject. I came here- for the purpose of inducing you to move into some fashionable quarter." "I will not move.

A gentle knock was given at the side entrance, and old Mrs. Wehlen entered with a large envelope in her hand, made a -respectful bow to Mrs. La Monte, and handed the letter to her son, saying, "Here, Otto, are the papers which the lawyer left at my house for you, and which he requested you to read carefully, and said they woulld explain how you could make the title good to your valuable real estate." "I have heard enough of that valuable piece of real estate. I don't believe your son ever owned that piece of property; it was all set up for a purpose," said Mrs. La Monte, with disdain. Old Mrs. Wehlen bowed her head in sorrow, while the son exclaimed, "TIhis is more than I can bear;" and addressing his mother-in-law, "Madame--" "rty son, remember that Mrs. La Monte is your mother, and you mlust respect her as such," said old Mrs. Wehlen feelingly. "Then she must respect me as her son, and not treat me as a confidence man." "Treat you as my son-never! for you intend to make of my daughter a maid-of-all-work, and that is the reason that you insist on living on Rox Street, where non-. of her former friends will call on her, that none should see and know of her drudgery; but you shall not succeed in your purpose, you mean plebeian! I curse you, and I curse the breast that has nourished you!" exclaimed Mrs. La Monte, the born Bottwell, with all the wrath of her natture. Otto Wehlen turned deadly pale, his eyes flashed fire, and his clenched fist resembled a sledge-hammer. He hissed be- tween his firm-set teeth, L Woman! were you a man, I would make you take back your cruel words and apologize, or you would feel the power of my arm. As it is, leave my pres-   OR, OUR DESTINY.        29 ence; for I cannot answer for what I might do if you remain longer under this roof. Begone!" "My son, for the sake of peace, master your anger, for your mother-in-law is not responsible for what she said, as the floodgates of her angry passions were wide open." "None of your pleadings, old witch; I will begone, and you, Viola, will go with me." She grasped her daughter and alhost lifted her from the room into her carriage, and ordered the coachman to drive home as fast as he could. Otto rushed from the room, and called loudly, "Viola, my wife, don't leave me! we will be happy if left alone!" but the carriage started with the curtains drawn down. The unhappy husband turned into the house, a cold pers- piration gathered on his brow, and he sank almost exhausted into the nearest chair. His mother threw herself on her knees, clasped the fever- ish hand of her dearly beloved son, covered it with kisses, and exclaimed with tears, "My son, my dear son! what will now becoe of you? Will you bear up under this hard blow like a man, or will you, like thousands and tens of thousands of men, who have been disappointed in their fondest hopes, try to drown that disappoiatmnent in fiery spirits that burn and consume the better part of man? Promise me, my child, that you will not touch intoxicating beverages; promise  for every moment of suspense seems like a century of suf- fering." "Fear not, mother. I promise you not to drink! My heart is pierced; it bleeds, and my soul is in mourning, but I am not one of those that hope to be cheered up by ar- dent spirits. I hope to be cheered and comforted in these my hours of trial, by the 'Great Spirit,' whom we call God, who is my rock and my hope. Rise, my dear mother; lament not, and go to your quiet house.

The son sprang to his feet, greatly alarmed at the words and grief of his usually calm mother, pleading, "My dear mother, you really alarm me! what do you mean by, ' when you know all?' Why do you weep? speak, explain I im- plore you!" "' No, I cannot! it is too dreadful for me to tell ; you will know it soon enough; prep)are yourself for a greater calam- ity than that which has now befallen you. Oh, God 1 what a misfortune, that people are so vain." "You are right, mother. Vanity is a great misfortune to humanity. Many a once happy heart has been made to beat in sorrow; many a once happy family has been torn asunder through the demon of vanity: even nations have shed torrents of blood, and loaded posterity with olDress- ive debts, in order to gratify vanity. If individuals, families, states, and the nation at large, practice and worship vanity, how could I, as a part and parcel of the whole, escape its baneful effects? I am now its un;fotunate victim. I know it, I feel it. Shall I surrender my individuality, my man- hood, my independence, and become a vain puppet? that is the question. No! thrice no!" exclaimed the young hus- band; and continued, "I have acted right in refusing that gift, which would have unmanned me anl-d undcermined lmy fiture happiness. Let me be sure on that point that I am right." He walked up and down the room in deep medita- tion, paused before his mother, and related to her all that had happened between him and his mother-in-law, while she was gone to bring the documents. "You have done wisely not to accept that present, for you would have lost your self-respect. Mrs. La Monte and   OR, OUR DESTINY.  her daughter would have tyrannized over you, and made your existence miserable; but what will you do now?" "Behave as if nothing had happened. If Viola will not come back, I will count myself among those ' who marry in haste and repent at leisure.'" He could say no more; his feelings overpowered him, and he wept. "Weep, my son, for blessed are those that can weep when they grieve. Those who 'marry in haste and repent at lei- sure,'-their number is legion ; but only a few weep to en- able the cloud to rise and let the sun of cheerfulness again shine within them ; they suppress their tea-rs; their spiril remains oppressed; darkness prevails within, and obstructs the power of reasoning wisely, to enable them to snatch suc- cess from the- very threshold of ignominious defeat. Weep, my son ; do not suppress your tears; they are a Godsend in such an hour; and after you have wept sufficiently, then men- tally glance 'over the situation, and reflect calmly; in order to decide on the course to be pursued. Remember that your whole future depends on your decision. Let it be based on forbearance and hope. Viola is yet somewhat childish ; will her through your exemplary virtues ; give her your whole heart; and when she gives you her heart, in re- turn, she will surely make you a good wife." "Mother! what do you mean? You doubt that I love Viola, and have wooed and married her from other motives than the purest love. I love her sincerely and devotedly." Mrs. Wehlen grew pale at that frank confession, and re- marked, "I doubt not that you love your wife, but only love her as thousands of husbands love their wives, 'partially' -dividing their affections between their wife and horse, their gun, fishing-tackle, with coloring their meerschaum pipes, with the well-filled bottle, a pack of cards, or perchance a pop- pet, artistically bundled up in dry goods, glittering with jew- els and shining paint."  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7121-00000017"/> 32      "THE FORGIVING KISS;" Thank God, that I am not addicted to any of those vices; the punctual performance of my daily duties, and my literary and musical studies, have no doubt saved me from contracting habits which are destructive of health and moral worth. I hoped that Viola would be a wife that would partake in my elevating p)leasures, and we would lead a quiet, unassuming, happy life, for such seemed her inclina- tion when I wooed her; but alas! I found her mind occu- pied with but one thought--that of dress, and the arrange- ment of her hair. She had to wear a particular costume at the breakfast table, another at noon, still another to take a walk, another again at the supper table, then change again for the opera. At each change of dress'the hair had to be differently arranged, and so the time passed, while we were gone, with dressing, and commenting on dress. It appeared very ridiculous to me, and I began to argue with my wife, that we have not been created only for the purpose of con- tinually dressing, and thinking of nothing else besides dress and fashions. While thus reasoning, a man of cultivated appearance introduced himself, and, with an air of great iniportance, handed me his credentials, showing that he was a reporter and correspondent of a metropolitan news- paper, which has a large circulation, being published daily and weekly ; and as he is about finishirig a letter to his paper, published in our native city, he would request to see the dif- ferent costumes that Mrs. Otto Wehlen was wearing on her  bridal tour, in order to describe them more fully. He would ask the lady to assist him in enumerating the names of the various laces, trimmiings, ornaments, and so forth. "I felt the blood rush to my head, for I looked upon the request, and the behavior of the man, as a piece of impu- dence, and peremptorily replied, that I did not wish the toilette of my wife gazetted, and bowed him out of the room. Viola-"   OR, OUR DESTlVNY.  33 -"You have made a great mistake," interrupted the moth- er, "by treating that reporter harshy, for the press is- a pow- er in our day, and this explains to me the allusion made of you, in one of the letters of that correspondent, published a few days ago. I brought the paper with me, to show it to you;" and Mrs. Wehlen drew from her ample pocket the Daily Metropolitan Journal, and read: "'Among other guests at the Grand Hotel, I noticed from your city Mr. and Mrs. Otto Wehlen, on their wedding tour. Mr. Wehlen looks the very type of young manhood, but somewhat stern for a young husband. Mrs. Wellen is loveliness personified, and the costumes in which she ap- peared on various occasions are marvels of richness, ele- gance, and good taste. May the character of the newly- married couple be as well blended and matched as the color and trimmings of Mrs. Wehlen's apparel.'" "What do you say to that?" asked the mother, looking earnestly at her son. "Say to that? nothing! but that it is just like the man, -polite and impudent in fine style." "I wish I could pass it by as lightly as you do, but know- ing what an effect that paragraph had on Mrs. La Monte, I regret its appearance in the paper. You had a taste of it this morning, and God above knows where it will lead and end." The son made no answer to the remarks of his mother, but continued to pace the room in revery, which his mother observed with great attention, trying to solve his thoughts. "Yes,!" exclaimed he, "I am too blunt, too upright i I have not made hypocrisy a study; it seems very much in vogue as a fine art; almost necessary to move on pleasantly, in certain circles of society, who call themselves the fashion- able, the elite." Mrs. Wehlen bowed her head mournfully, and said, "Alas!  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7121-00000018"/> 34      "THE FORGIVING KISS; " it is so, and yet you must reconcile yourself to the state of affairs that surrounds you. You must not be a blunt, but a fine polished instrument, that shapes and moulds those with whom you come in contact, after your mode of reflection and action-that of uprightness and sincerity--but not of positiveness, for positive can only be He who is all-wise; but we poor human creatures, with our grain of wisdom, we dare not be positive that we are always correct. We must respect the feelings and the views of. others, and this makes me think that you have acted hastily in finding fault with Viola's love of dressing, in objecting to have her outfit described by the correspondent, and by not complying with the request of your mother-in-law, to make your home in a more fashionable quarter." "Mother, you seem not to keep in view that this would have encouraged the vanity of my wife; and to reside in a more elegant neighborhood would have cost more than I can afford. Plain facts must be plainly dealt with. On the whole I have not acted unwisely." "Then you have given up really all intention of trying to make the title of your real estate good? See at least what the lawyer proposes. Being possessed of a million of dollars in real estate, you could afford to live elegantly on Clinton Heights, become the pride of your mother-in-law, who would then assist you to make Viola as you wish her to be--a plain, unassuming, charitable, good wife, who loves her husband, and those whom God has given her to love and to bring up in the path of virtue and usefulness." "Yes, yes, my darling mother; that was my. hope, my fondest dream, that my wife would be, when I wooed and married her, but-" "I know what you want to say, my son," interrupted the mother. "Such wives are not born, but brought up. Your wife has not been blessed with a mother that could bring   OR, OUR DESlTIY.        35 her up to be such a wife. What a mother's inattention or in- ability has failed to accomplish, the husband must rectify. It is a great task but a worthy one, which secures peace, prosperity, and happiness." "That was my intention; and I hoped to succeed, and would, no doubt, have succeeded, if left alone by my mother- in-law. It is a misfortune that she called and meddled with our affairs, and made us both miserable, perhaps for life." "No, mly son, I hope not. I hope that by wise and prompt action on your part, you can become reconciled with your mother-in-law, and through that reconciliation you will make of Viola a wife according to your heart's desire," A- gleam of hope beamed fi'O!l the tearful eyes of the young husband, as the words were uttered by his mother, "You will make of Viola a wife according to your heart's de- sire," but that ray of hope was quickly eclipsed by a cloud of gloom, and he despondingly exclaimed, "No! I never can become reconciled with my mother-in-law. She has of- fended us both too deeply to approach her in the spirit of reconciliation. No, I cannot lumble myself thus." "The good often humble themselves for the sake of peace and prosperity. It is only the proud and arrogant that stand on their dignity, and will not move a hair'sbreadth to concil- iate and again live in harmony. You must be wiser than your meddlesome mother-in-law.

"Forgiveness is an oil from Heaven ; it is a healing balm *for a wounded spirit; it is the dew that prolongs life, and paves our path with flowers instead of thorns."

Her tongue and wrath are terrible, and her demands unrcason-  able-" "Not so very unreasonable," interrupted the mother.    -:; Let us view the whole case calmly. Mrs. John James La , Monte is the only daughter of a very vain, wealthy mother,  : who never thought of anything but fashionable dress and family pride, with which she stored the mind of her child, and which she practiced as a wife and mother to the ex- tremest end.' She bent her energies to be most fashionably dressed in the costhest attire, and at every opportunity  boasted of being the born Bottwell, and lamented that Mr.  : John James La Monte, though an excellent man, and her    i: husband, was of humble origin, and consoled herself with the idea that her daughter should marry a foreign dignitary. Counts were invited for that purpose, but fortunately or un- -  fortunateiy, I do not know which, those Counts were no    ' Counts at all. You serenaded me. Viola heard and saw you,  r' and fell in love with you. You made a New Year's call by in- vitation, and reciprocated that love, proposed, and were accepted by the parents of Viola, looking upon your real estate as being worth a million of dollars. As a millionnaire, you were accepted, even by Mrs. John James La Monte.     I Imagine their disappointment when they found that the title to your real estate was valueless. It is to your credit as a man of honor and good sense, that when you found the, title  to your real estate worthless, you proposed to break off the proposed union, which was too late to be done without dis- grace." Mrs. Wehlen paused, as if to collect her thoughts. Since you were gone, the will of old Mr. Bottwell has' been opened, and revealed the fact, that his only daughter, Mrs. John James La Monte, became the sole heir of his estate, amounting to one million five-twenty United States   6R, OUR DESTINY.         37 bonds, and large unimproved property of prospective value. Not one cent did that mnillionnaire leave for public good. Now Mrs. La Monte, being herself a millionnaire, feels it so much keener that her son-in-law, whom she expected to be one of the European nobility, or at least a millionnaire, is only one of the sovereigns of the great American Republic, and not a millionnaire at that; the worst of all, that that son-in-law will not consent to make a grand display of wealth, so dear to the hearts of the Bottwells; will accept no gifts, but content , himself with living within his own means, rich in hope, and firm in the faith of building up his own home and future." "That is my resolve," ejaculated the young husband earnestly. "It is a noble resolve," replied the mother; and she hesitat- ingly continued : "You must rely on yourself. Alas! your wife is not a helpmate ; her education has been whimsical and of elegant idleness. If idleness can be called elegant, she has not the slightest conception of the real duties of a wife. What she expects of her husband is to be courted, petted, and waited on. In return, she will waste money fool- ishy and dress extravagantly, and thus pass her time without taking any further interest in the welfare of her husband and family, or the community at large." The husbandslistened attentively, and a heavy sigh escaped his breast. The mnother quickly perceived it, and. tears gathered in her eyes, slowly rolling down on her wan cheeks. ' Yes, my son," said-she in a mournful tone, "I feel that it is almost sacrilegious to say anything about a wife to her husband that would lower her in his estimation, or mar his hope for happiness; but I feel it as my duty to forewarn you of what you really have to expect firom your wife.' You must keep in view that 'her grandmother was one of the most vain women that perhaps ever existed; that her own mother  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7121-00000020"/> 38      "THE FORGIVING KISS; " is not less vain ; that her grandfather was a relentless money- maker, who neveir gave a poor man a chance to earn a dol- lar, for fear it might not bring as quick an interest on the outlay as if otherwise invested: that he was an uncharitable man, as his last will testifies, for not a cent did he bequeath for charitable purposes. He lived and died a miser. Her father, you know as well or perhaps better than I do. She is, therefore, the child of extreme vanity and extreme selfish- ness-a shadow out of which love alone can create a being to perform cheerfully the higher duties of life, and rear a virtuous family-to add to the intelligence, prosperity, and happiness of the community, and elevate mankind. It re- mains to be seen whether her love for extravagance and show is or is not greater than her love for you, and-" "Please, mother, do not demolish the idol of my heart. Viola, with all her faults, is my wife, and I hope, through my patience and God's blessing, she will be a good wife, who  will cheer and bless my existence, as I will try to cheer and bless hers," exclaimed Otto Wehlen feelingly. "God forbid," exclainmed his mother, alarmed at the ges-  { ture and tone of her son, "God forbid that I should say or do anything intentionally to eradicate your love for your wife; She is almost as dear to me as you are, lut what I am  aiming at, is for you to putrsue the riglt course to become  reconciled to your mother-in-law, and through her to your wife, and that reconciliation can and will only be effected by your making the title to your real estate good. Being once more the millionnaire, and living in the style of our modern millionnaire, the road of reconciliation between you and   7 your mnother-in-law and your wife will be as smooth as velvet; but, unless as a millionnaire, your chances for reconciliation : are very precarious. It is of vital importance that you should promptly act in this matter.. Here are the documents that  the lawyer left with me; and, as Goethe says, I now say to  * ' ' ^     I   R, OURz DESTINY.         39 39 you,  'What's left undone to-day, to-morrow will not do: "' Waste not a day in vain digression. With resolute, courageous trust, Seize every possible impression And make it firmly your possession.'" "Thank you, mother," exclaimed her son (as he took the envelope, and placed it in his pocket). "I will give this my undivided attention, in due time; but, before I proceed with this, tell me who -was my father, what was his profession, when and where did he die, who were my relatives, and-- Spare me these questions," said his mother beseechingly. "I have nothing of your father in my possession, except this, my wedding ring, and my marriage certificate; the rest has vanished. As for your relatives, they are only so in name. They have never cared to know you, and advance your pros- perity but once become the acknowledged millionnaire, and they will appear and buzz about you like flies on a sun- beamed window, and you will then have ample opportunity to know themll." "Mother, please tell me something about my father and my ancestors. I have so often asked you to give me our family history, and you have invariably evaded my reasona- ble requlest." "I expect from my son filial confidence. If his mother de- clines to relate family matters, just now, she has her reasons for it which ought to suffice. Let the past alone, but take good care of the present, and the future will take care of itself, even if you do not know all about your ancestors." This was said with so much commanding energy, that the son did not dare to allude to the matter, of so vast impor- tance to him, but remained silent and lost in reflection, from which only a quick ringing of the door-bell recalled hiil. He stepped to the door.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7121-00000021"/>  "Patrick, is it you?" exclaimed Otto Wehlen as he opened the door, and beheld his former ostler: "walk in." "Yes, squire ; thank you ; it is your old Pat, who comes to see whether you would engage him to take care of your horse,  and make himself generally useful." "You are married now, and should not live out, but have an occupation that gives you the chance of being with your family." "That was my intention when I married, but alack! when young I learned no trade, and all that I am now capa- ble of doing is ostlering, and working with pick and sliovel. The wages for a good picker and shoveller are one dollar and fifty cents to two dollars a day; it depends on the extent of the job, but, unfortunately, this was a wet season. When, it rains, the pickers and shovellers have to stop, and when the weather is pleasant, the next day they cannot work, as the road is too munddy for the teams to haul, as the dump is too  soft, and thus there are often weeks when I can only earn fromn one and a half to three dollars, which is not sufficient to  support ime and my wifet." "I dare say not. Ilow much do you pay for rent, and how many rooms have you?"                    , "I pay eight dollars a month for one room; that is all we occupy." "Eight dollars for one room is not that rather high? It must be on some proninent street, in some grand structure." "That is as cheap a room as I could find in the city; it is on one of the side-streets ; the house is an old tenement-house, full of people and vermin, and if it were not for the excel- lent cat that my wife has, the rats would gnaw up whatever  little we possesS."               ' " "And that is as good a room as you could find?"  "For that price it is, and I have hard times to pay even 1 that."    ........'. 41 "I don't see how you can subsist, if you have weeks when you only earn three dollars." "It is lucky for me that my wife is not too prougd to work. She goes out washing and ironing, and that helps consider- ably to make both ends meet. She told me that if I could find a good place where I could tend the horses, and she to do the house-work, she would be willing to break up house and take the place. Perhaps your lady would like to have a com- petent person. My wife is an excellent cook. Augustine taught her to cook well, and IMithout waste." "Who is Augustine?" "That is the name of the girl xyho was at Edward Hun- ting's, where my wife was doing the chamber-work, blit who afterward proved to be a countess, and married Captain Augustus Hunting." "Yes, yes, I now remember; I am really sorry that you have rather hard times, but you are a good deal to blame for it yourself. When you were attending my horses, I paid you wages, and often reminded you to save your money, to de- posit it in the savimngs bank, but you had. the habit of depos- iting it for drinks and cigars, at the saloons, for yourself and a set of idlers who loitered around the bar. Had you followed up my advice, you would now have been able to start out West with your wife, where land is almost given away, and farm. The rains that you now complain of as a disadvan- tage, would under such circumstances prove a great blessing. You would not have been compelled to crowd yourself in one room in a crowded tenement-house, and pay your hard- earned eight dollars monthly for that sickening privilege. You would not be compelled to see your wife go and wash other people's clothes, and acknowledge that those earnings saved you from starving, and readily consent that your wife should again become a servant. All this humiliation you brought on yourself, because you would not save your earnings while I-   --      1   -IIi iI  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7121-00000022"/> 42      "T  fHE FORGIVING KISS.;" you were single, with which to build up a home of your own, and grow up with your family in comparative independence. Yes, Patrick,you would have been a different man to-day if you had heeded my advice, and not taken the arch enemy in your mouth, that not only consumed your means, but your ilmus- cle and brain." "Before I nmrried, Ellen made nme take the pledge, which I have kept and will never break." "That's right; I hope that you will act like a man and keep the pledge." "Squire, give me one more chance. I like to work for you, and you will see how saving I will be. You have spoken words that wenf like a blast through my soul. I see myself now as others see me : instead of being a day-laborer or servant I ought to be a farmer-, on whose propriety the pros- perity of all in a great measure depends." "Pat, you are of a quick comprehension; profit by it. As for engaging you, I cannot do it, as I have made arrange- ments to board my horse at a livery-stable. Read the ad-  vcrtisements; perhaps some one can make use of your ser- vices." "Squire, will you please look in the paper for me, as I cannot read," stammered Patrick, with a blush. Otto Wehlen picked up the newspapers, saying, "It is in- deed unfortunate that you did not in your youth learn at least to read and write. Who is to blame: your parents, the State, or your church? I think Infallibility is at the bottom of it." He carefully read the advertisements. "This, I think, will answer your case," which he read: "Wanted : a first- class coachman and gardener, who thoroughly understands his business, is a good stylish driver and a fancy gardener;  sober, honest, and obliging; a married man preferred, whose wife is a good cook and ironer; best references required. Apply at Peacockview Cottage from Io A. M. till 3 P. M."   OR, OUR DESTNY.         43 "This will suit me exactly!" exclaimed Patrick, joyfully. "Well, you can go there and name nme as a reference." "Thank you, Squire; may God and the holy saints bless you with youthfulness, till you reach threescore and ten!" and he bowed himself out of the room. Mrs. Wehlen looked proudly at her son, and said, "You have acted wisely in not engaging that man, and have given him a lecture that was worth listening to. I hope that he will benefit by it." "I think he will, for I made an impression on him; and beside that, he has evidently a good wife who will keep him on the right path." "No doubt she will as long as he will abstain from strong drinks.; but should he again drink, the poor woman might as well try to manage an infuriated bull who runs headlong to destruction, as her drunkard husband. God help her, and be with her and all other wives and mothers whose husbands or sons are drunkards! It is the hardest blow to the prosperity and happiness of the family ; they can expect everything that is bad and not a grain of good in return ; in the drunka d's breast are germs of crime in its thousand forms which makes sad havoc with prosperity and often life itself. Oh, my son, whatever misfortune should befall you, never, never seek relief in the cup, for then you cease to be a man, and be- come a vicious beast." "  Mother, have no fears; your son will not try to find re- lief for his sorrow in the cup; he will bear his misfortunes with religious resignation, and hope for better days." "Thanks, a thousand thanks, for your blessed words.- I must now go, for I have a great duty to perform. I will send you Mrs. Goldrick, who will attend to your household affairs." "No, mother, I would not allow you to deprive yourself of her services."  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7121-00000023"/> "      THE FORGI ING KISS;" "I can get some one else in her place, while you, under your present circumstances, could not get a person who is so suitable to keep house for you as old Mrs. Goldrick." She kissed her son with all the fervency of a mother's love, and quickly departed. She was hardly out of the house when she met Peter, the old porter at the bank, who, seeing her, exclaimed, "I am so glad to meet you. What a time I have had to find lRox Street, and now to find the residence of your son!" "It is the second house from where we stand; you see Otto? he is now at the front window, looking in this direc- tion." "Yes, I see him. Thank you." "Stop, Peter, anything new at the bank? Was Mrs. La Monte or Rosalind down at the bank this forenoon?" No, Mrs. Wehlen, there is nothing particularly new at the bank. I have not seen Mrs. La Monte nor Rosalind there to-day. They seldom come down. Mr. and Mrs. La Monte don't seem to be on good terms since the marriage of Viola to your son. I am sure that Viola never could have got a nicer husband than Otto is, but these big folks don't know, half the time, what they want. Too much money, too much wealth, and no cares, make them half crazy. I am sorry for Mr. La Monte. It begiis to tell on him." "Peter, you babble too much." "Only to you, Mrs. Wehlen, only to you " for he was interrupted as Otto beckoned to him to come on. "I am heartily glad to see you. How do you do, my dear Otto?-no, Mr. Wehlen." "' Never mind, Peter; just call me Otto as you have done these last fifteen years." "Wtell, if you have no objection I will continue to call you by your given name; it will be more natural to me, and   OR, OUR DESTINY.        45 I will not respect you less for it. You look somewhat care- worn. I heard you are well; and if you are not, I am sure that, residing on this street, you will recover your former health. ful vigor. I never would have believed that it is so charm- ing to live on these high streets. How clear the air is up here, and how grand those distant hills and the good old river ap- pear from this point! Viola-excuse me, your wife-must like this scenery; she used to be so fond of landscapes when she was a little miss. I presume she is taking a xest, being fatigued from travel. I often thought of you both when you were gone, and wondered how the children are enjoying them- selves. Dear me, how the time flies! It seems to me like a month ago when Mr. La ATonte us-l to call me, 'Pete, go home; I believe the girls have left us. Help Mrs. Wehlen to bring up some coal to the kitchen and rooms, chop some wood, and if the weather permits take the children out walking.' Viola was then yet a babe, and I had to wheel her in her little carriage, while I had Winfred in my arms, and Rosalind held herself fast to my coat. They had then no horses and carriages ; it was not so fashionable as it is now." ' I was not aware that you ever went to the house of Mr. La Monte to help about the house." "I had to keep it to myself, as Mr. La Monte positively instructed me not to mention it. It would have cost me my situation if I had done so. I had to go there often, for Mrs. La Monte had such a terrible temper that no girl would stay there. All the work was too hard for your mother, and I had to come and help her." "Why did you, not tell me that my mother had to work so hard?" "Because I was forbidden by Mr. La Monte to tell any one that I worked at the house; and besides that, I thought you know of it." "I wish to God that I had known it, I would not have al-  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7121-00000024"/> lowed it. I was told that she was only a superintendent of the household affairs, seeing that the servants did their duty, and that the children learned their lessons and did not associate with ill-behaved children, and that, in short, she was treated as one of the family." "That's it, that's it " exclaimed Peter, clapping his hands. "Now I understand why Mr. La Monte was so particular for me not to tell that I went to the house-so that you should not ask me what your mother was doing. And now it -is clear to me why you left your mother there. Otto, she had to work very hard and stand much abuse fromn Mrs. La Monte. But. this is now past; better days are now in store for her." Tears stood in the eyes of Otto, which the old porter noticed, and said, "I could slap myself for having babbled so  much; but I did not mean any harm, Otto; please don't be ; angry with me."  "No, Peter, I am not angry with you; I am angry with  myself; I fear I have not done my duty as a good son toward  my mother." "Had you known it, you would no doubt have behaved  otherwise."  "Here lies the blame: I ought to have known it; it is the most solemn duty of every son to know whether his mother passes a happy life, and how he can best promote her happi-  ness. I feel wretched that I have failed to perform that great duty," "Now don't worry over it; you can make up for it, and I am sure you will, for your heart is good, your prospects are - brighlt, and you are now the millionnairc. Ever since you were . married the boys at the bankl have been talking about your , prospect and your lots at the park. There is even some talk now of their building the Grand Hotel of the city on your f lots, or adjoining them. Surely you made a lucky hit   t-/ when you bought that God-forsaken hill. - Twenty-five years ago a man on horseback, hatless, and hair dishevelled, stop- ped before Imy stable, saying, 'Neighbor, for any kind of a saddle, an old hat, and a chew of tobacco I will deedl you the adjacent hill.' I looked at that man to see whether he was in earnest, and he soon convinced me that he was ; I gave him a chew of tobacco for notlhig, but preferred my old hat and saddie to that hill." Otto Wehlen laughed, and asked, "Are you sure it is tlat hill ? "I know it is, for I often thought of the circumstance and that bareheaded man on an old nag." ' Did you ever meet him " "No, never, although I often looked for him." "Now this same property is considered a bargain at fifteen hundred dollars per front foot. This is indeed a great world we live in! "And which is made far greater and pleasanter by the activity of man," replied Otto, as if speaking to himself. "Yes, activity-that is the great word with Mr. La Monte; and that reminds me in what haste he was to send me for you.. You shall please come down to the bank at your ear- liest convenience." "Anything up' at the bank?" Yes, something extraordinary must have happened : the whole board met, had a prolonged session, and closed by emptying a dozen bottles of Golden Eagle; the gray-heads were as jolly as boys of eighteen. Some lost claims of a large amount must have becomn  available, else they would not have been so merry." Otto listened, and mused, "Our bank has not lost any money, to my knowledge, for we do not discount any paper unless it is first-class; the moment-we have a shadow of a doubt whether it will be met at maturity we take the benefit  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7121-00000025"/> q48    "TIZE FORGIVING KICSS;" of that doubt and pass it; it is the only safe way to do a banking business. I must go down and see what Mr. Ia Monte wants, but before I go I must send this note to my mother." He took his mlemorandum-book from his pocket, and wrote in pencil: "MY DEAR MOTHER: "I will consider it a great favdr if you will not send Mrs. Goldrick to take care of my house, but keep her in your service, for I am sure that she will do her best to add as much to your comfort as she possibly can, which it is doubtful any other person will do as well. It will put me to no inconvenience, as I have a reliable man- servant in view who will attend to my wants; Mr. La Monte wishes to see me. I am going to the bank. Will be back by 5 P. M. and call at your house. In the meantime I beg you to be cheerful, and borrow no trouble on account of your loving son." Otto Wehlen folded the note, and handed it to Peter, say- ing, "Please take this to my mother; she lives on this street, the sixth house below, opposite." Peter took the note as directed, while Otto locked the doors and shutters, and was on the point of closing the front door when he noticed a lady hastening toward his house, mo- tioning to him to wait. She soon reached the gate, and while catching her breath exclaimed, How glad I am to find you at home. Perhaps you don't know me; my name is Mrs. Susan Fraa-" again catching her breath, which was too short to finish the word. Mr. Wehlen, noticing her exhausted condition,  invited her in and offered her a chair.         .

Mrs. Goldrick always made up the parcel for me, and paid me the next. lay after I brought it." "You are Susan the seamstress, in whose welfare Mrs. Goldrick took such a lively interest. Have you brought anything for me to-day?" "Yes, sir; half a dozen shirts, in which I have inserted new bosoms and cuffs. I never could think why those cuffs fringe out so quickly; it 1must be because I used to line the cuffs with common cotton cloth, and when the cuffs get starched the cotton absorbs more of the starch; it therefore is stiffer, and that cuts the edge of the cuff. In order to avoid that, I made these cuffs three-ply, all out of the same linen, which I think will make them wear miuch better." "But this will give you less work hereafter," added Otto Wehlen, good-naturedly ; "have you brought my bill?-" The seamstress timidly handed him the bill, which read: Six shirt-fronts @  35 ......... ........... , .

The ten dollars in her hands are of greater value than the million dollars in the hands of my mother in-law, Mrs. John James La Monte, the born Bottwell." He flung the door to and locked it, and with a firm step hurried down town to the bank.   OR, O UR D  ,ES TINY.       5 CHAPTER   II.

SHAKESPEARE. T is midnight.   The streets of the large city are all fl  deserted. A storm rages which sends the idlers and !:   city night-owls sooner to their nests. The rain splashes heavily on the sidewalks, and the few trees planted on the streets by some lover of nature bow down before the storml-king. A woman, poorly but neatly clad, of regular feat- ures, illuminated by the diadem of purity and duty, drew the window-curtains and looked out on the gloomy streets. A flash of lightning disclosed the anxiety depicted on her face and bearing; she wrung her hands, and exclaimed, "What a night to be out, what a night to be alone waiting for him to come!"She drew down the curtain, and threw herself into a chair of which half the cane seat was out.

The clock of the cathedral struck. The occupant of the gloomly room gloom- ily counted the strokes. "It is twelve o'clock, and not at 1Cho)m yet." C Maa, water; ma, water," called a child, lifting its head fromn the pillow. "Della, be quiet or you will wake the baby. Here is water ; drink and go to sleep." The little girl took a hearty drink, and soon again slum- bered healthfully. "He has not come yet. Let me sew; the time will not Dass so heavily;" and with these words the mother stepped to the bureau, opened it as noiselessly as possible, and took out her sewing-basket, and soon plied her needle quickly. She. was hardly seated when the-lbabe began to cry; she rocked the cradle with her foot, sewing still. But rocking did not satisfy the baby. '"He wants to be taken ; he is hungry; I have nothing for him, but will give him what I have; " and the clild was soon in the mother's arms and at her breast, and botl fell asleep. A voice was heard in the hall, and a man roughly entered the roonm, took off his hat, which he threw under the bed, Iulled off his muddy boots, which he placed on the table. The wife and mother awoke and was firightened at the awful sight, for her husband was tottering drunk. "O God! what do I see! Drunll again, notwithstanding that he signed the pledge?

The carouser sprang to his feet, seized the nearest chair, lifted it high up over the head of his wife, and said, "Call me a drunkard again and I will dash your brains out!" The babe in the mother's arms uttered a cry of pain ; little Della also awoke, and cried, "Papa! papa, don't!" which brought the drunkard partly to his senses; he lowered the chair, and without undressing, threw himself across the bed, and soon fll into a heavy sleep.

"Don't be afraid ; God watches over us and-the good pray for us." (God is good and there are good people in the world, you always say, ma." "Yes, Della ; now cover yourself up and go to sleep." The oil in the lamp being consumed and none in the house to fill it, the taper flickered, and gradually the light grew dlimmer, and. darkness prevailed in the room. The storm without raged nlore and more furiously; the very heavens seemed to open and flashed forth lightning of an awful grandeur, accompanied by claps of loud thunder, torrents of rain, and violent wind. Slowly and cautiously did the mother leave her chair, stepp)el to the cradle, and laid the sleeping babe down. Another flash of lightning slione upon the peaceful features. The mother watched; she bent down and kissed the little brow, threw herself on her knees, clasped her hands, lifted her eyes heavenward, and prayed: O God 1 Thou m lly I:Ieavenly Father, who hast endowed man with reasoi with a longing to become better and nobler, to be worthy of Thy image, to be worthy to govern  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7121-00000028"/> 54      "T IrE' FORGIVING AKISS;'" what lives and exists on earth, avert from mankind the living curse of drunkenniess, which makes of men ferocious beasts. Look down on my distracted home, which drunken- ness has ruined. Be mercifil unto us if we have erred and deserved it; send succor for the sake of our innocent chil- dren." She could not proceed with her fervent prayer, for  grief overpowered her ; she sobbed, and sank exhausted on the floor, and nature kindly sent her to sleep. The storm without gradually grew less violent, the clouds dispersed, and the cheerful face of the moon lit up the hori- zon. Streaks of light made even that umble rooml more cheerful, and displayed the reposing featulres of its sleeping occupants: a hapDy smile rested on the countenance of the wife and mother; she dreamed that she was in the country, where the sunlight is not blinded by stones, brick, and mor- tar ; she walked on a velvet-like lane, dotted with flowers in full bloom, while near her were-tall trees which bowed un- der a gentle breeze, and on their branches clung .birds sweetly singing ; near them she saw a well-built house with large barns in the rear. A big NewCfoundland dog bounded forth joyously and licked her hand re peatedly. "Go away, Sigan ; don't be m-naughty, Sigan; li dot\ n,. Sigan," escaped her lips. -Her voice seemied to attract the attention of a lady living in the colfortable ohouse, wlio exclaimed, ' I am so glad you are here Susan.

You must drink some of the fresh milk, and wash your face, hands, and arms, so that you may be even fairer than you are. Come, darling dalugttelr, come." The Ilother clasped her hand tenderly, and led her toward the stable.  Stately-looking cows walked slowly toward their abode, still mowing somel of the grass on which they feasted ; and the amply filled udder gave the richest alnd sweetest nilk. "Drink, drink, my child, to your heart's content; drink   OR, OUR DESTINY.        55 this milk, it will do you good." The dreamer seemed as if she partook of the warm, health-giving drink. A quick tramp- ing of horses' hoofs, and the rattling of a wagon which halted before the house, awoke the dreamer; she sprang to her feet, stepped to the window, drew the curtain aside ; she saw the mlilkman measure out a quart of milk, who left with it his team, walked into the yard by the side entrance, lifted the dover of the milk-pot which stood there ready to receive it; he examined the inside of the pot carefully, as if to find something there. "Nix!" exclaimed he witl disdain: "kein geld [no money]; bin wieder betrogen" [am again cheated]. He put the pot down, and gave it an unceremo- nious kick, walking back with the quart of milk. All this the dreamer, awakening, noticed. She quickly lifted up the window, and called out in an undertone, "Milkman, I had to disappoint you again by not placing the money I owe you in the milklpot, for the money I expected did not come to hand ; but I surely will pay you to-morrow. Just leave that quart of milk here 1 " "Nix, Mrs. Fraazer, nix; you haf promised fery often," and he walked on. "Then leave only a pint of it here; I need it for the chil- dren!" But the milkman made no further reply, stepped into his wagon, poured the milk back into the can, gave the horses a sharp stroke to vent his anger, and kept exclaiming, "Kein geld ; bin wieder betrogen." "So it is if one does not pay one's debts. Gradually the credit dwindles down, so that one cannot even buy a pint of milk on credit from an ignorant Dutchman," said Mrs. Fraa- zer to herself, biting her finger-nails; and she continued: "But why call that German ignorant? he is more intelligent than my husband, for my husband places no value on property.

I have not eaten a square meal for months, and the children share the same poor fare. There is no water, no fuel, no light in the house. The water-works trustees have turned off the water because the water rent was not paid. The coal dealers would not deliver any coal, unless it is paid in advance; and the same is the case with the gas company, who turned off the gas. The landlord threatens to turn us out on the street if the rent is not promptly paid; hle seems ldetermined to do it. Can there be any one poorer than I am?"Tears gathered in'the eyes of the poor creature ; she rolled up the window curtain, gazed at the moon, and whispered, "Thou beautiful moon, Hlove to gaze on thy strange face, for I know that my good mother loves to look at thee and speculate on thy habitation and space. Thou, moon, hast seen the timle when I walked lovingly and hopefully with him, and listened to his thousand promises. Thou, moon0, hast seen when Hno, let me not speak of it, let me try to forget it; let me try to forget what I was and what I am." A flood of tears rolled rapidly down on her wan cheeks, and her loud sobs, which she could not suppress, awoke the infant. "My duty c:!ll me," said she; " let me be cheerful or the babe will be as gloomy, as unhalpy, and wretched as I am." But the mother's breast had no nourishment. It cried, it moaned, it kicked its little feet, and resolutely attempted to feed from its mother's breast, but alas! there was none. "Child, drink my life blood, but be quiet, or else you will awake your father before he has slept off his drowsiness, and there will be, oh! such terrible trouble;" and the mother pressed the babe closer to her breast. "What a beautiful dream I had! I wished I had some of the good milk I used to have in sich abundance in my childhood-but no, I must  not think of it." The baby still cried, and the mother grasped a faded shawl, wrapped the baby in it, and noiselessly walked downstairs.   R0, OUR DESTINY .        7 Reaching the kitchen, she placed the infant in a baby- chair, took the teapot and examined a few tea-leaves in it. "Yes," said she, "by boiling some hot water I can yet steam some fiagments of tea out of those leaves, although they have been boiled over and over again. But where find some coal or wood? Let me search again in' that heap of coal-dust: perhaps I can find a few nuggets, and whittle from the stair-steps a few strips of wood to kindle the fire." Down she went into the cellar with poker in hand, and be- gan to dig up;the pile of accumulated coal-dust and ashes, for some of the tenants have a habit of taking dow!n a bucket of ashes in the cellar and bringing tup a bucket of coal; it saves a step to take it out in the yard and place it in the ash-barrel; never mind the uncleanness and unreasonable- ness: nobody sees it, and the heartless landlord can have it cleaned at a great expense. Mrs. Fraazer was not success- ful in finding nuggets of coal, and she lost her temper. "I must have fuel; I must cool some of that tea for the baby and myself." The joist on wlich the floor rested looked tempting; she grasped the hatchet, but could not reach up. Nothing daunted, she proceeded with the same hatchet to tear up the bricks of the cellar floor, and soon had enough up to make a comfortable foot-stool, on which she was able to reach the joist, and with energetic blows she soon chopped down enough, not only to cook a cup of tea, but to roast a ten-pound breast of veal. The baby in the meantime kept crying lustily, and the angry mother kept saying, "Just cry, my son : it will make your lungs stronger, and you may need them when on the stump to be elected a senator or per- chance President of the United States." With the same energy'with which the wood was chopped from the joist it was placed properly in the stove, ready to be lit; but alas! there was no match in the house, and Mrs. I'raazer hastened to the nearest grocery-store.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7121-00000030"/> 5g      " /THE F OR CIVIG A' ISS;" The clerk was just taking the shutters down and getting ready for business. Mrs. Fraazer greeted him with a very pleasant "Good-morning," to which the salesman made a very indifferent reply; but the poor woman went on; 1 should like to get some matches." Y;ou can have anything we keep in stock, for cash!" "Then you don't trust any more?" "Yes, madam ; poor trust is dead : cash on the nail has superseded him. No more trusting in this store!" "Well," answered Mrs. Fraazer, ' I only. wanted five cents' worth of matches, a nine-cent loaf of bread, a pound of good brown sugar, and-" "And a piece of soap, a bag of self-raising flour, a scrub- bing-brush, a broom, and a pound or two of dried beef, a pound of mixed tea, a pound of coffee!" interrupted the clerk with a sneer. "You need not make fun of mly poverty; whatever 1 owe you or may buy on credit I will surely pay; it is only a question of time," pleaded Mrs. Fraazer. "Time is everything, and that is what you and your husband take to pay your debts with. ;Just wait, we ain't ready ; we need more time.' Well, madam, we have decided not to lose any time and any more money with customers like you." "You are very severe this morning. Just let me have five cents' worth of matches, and a five-cent loaf of bread. 1 will surely pay you to-day." "No, madam, I am  determined not to trust. Grati- tude to my employer demands it of me. He took me into his employ when I was a poor boy, and what I am and what I possess I owe to his kindness. He was then a healthy and roblst man, his affairs in as healthy a condition.

And the shortest road to regain our former healthy condition is not to trust. We must either have goods or cash. Here: I loan you out of my own pocket fifteen cents, with which you can buy matches and bread; but please do not ask ume to sell anything on credit." "You are very kind. I will pay you the fifteen cents be- fore night, even if I have to beg for it." Being in possession of the much-treasured bread and matches she hurried home. The fire in the stove was soon in full blast, and the water boiled with which Mrs. Fraazer steamed out a passable cup of tea, which she and the little in- fant greatly relished. "Let me leave some of the bread and tea for Della, and while she is asleep let me take the sewing to Mrs. Goldrick, and see whether Mr. Wehlen has arrived from his wedding tour." She wrapped up the sewing, and took the baby with her, and after a long walk reached the house of MArs. Goldrick, where she learned that Mr. Wehlen had arrived. Then leaving the baby at Mrs. Goidrick's, she arrived at Mr. Otto Wehlen's house, as we have already related. Mrs. Goldrick was very fond of little babies, and gladly im- proved the o)pportunity of giving the baby some sponge-cake and warm milk, and then hugged and rocked it to sleep. " 1Who is that lady?" asked Mrs. Wehlen. "Hler name is Susan, and 1 believe her husband's name is Andrew Fraazer. I knew her mother well before she was married. She befriended me. She not only paid the entire funeral expenses of my poor husband, so that I could give him a decent Christian burial, but also recommended me to several very nice families that gave me steady employment and good wages. I am right glad that I could repay her kindness by getting her daughter work, for she has done all the sewing for Otto these eight years, and he always left more money to pay for the sewing than she asked, saying,  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7121-00000031"/> 6o      "TIE FORGIVING KISS;" "Let that poor seamstress have a few dollars more ; the Lord knows how sorely she may be in need of it." "And whom did her mother marry?" "Well, Mrs. Wehlen, I really forget the name. Let me think. I believe it is Caleb Rusha Titus, or something like that." "Caleb Rusha Titus!" exclaimed Mrs. Wehlen, growing deadly pale. ' I only know of one Caleb Rusha Titus. There can be no other like him." "Wait. When M7rs. Susan comes I will ask her the name of her father and where they live, although I know she does not like to be questioned: there seems some mystery about her being in the city and so poor." ' No, Mrs. Goldrick, no ; for pity's sake don't ask her," and Mrs. Wehlen took the nearest chair, murmuring, "O God, strengthen my loins; I tremble in every limb with weakness and fear." At this moment Mrs. Susan returned, holding firmly the money received from Mr. Otto Wehlen for her needle- work; and while she is introduced by Mrs. Goldrick to Ars. Wehlen, let us, gentle reader, pass down fromn beau- tiful Rox Street to the crowded valley below, and to the bank, where Mr. John James La Monte anxiously awaited the arrival of his son-in-law, Mr. Otto Wehlen.

As .for me, I would not give a fig for the difference. If anything, I would pre- fer her marrying Charles Hunting, for he' seems of late to have entirely reformed, is a capital business man, which his large, increasing deposits plainly indicate; and, what is more, he very seldom discounts, and all the paper he discounts is met promDtly. Outside of his business, he seems a growing public favorite, for he plans or heads handsomely every public enterprise. He is a rising young man, worthy to be the son- in-law of John James La Monte, president of one of the most successful banks on the continent." He paused, took his cigar-case, selected a Havana, lit it, and smoked in the most abandon malnner, curling the smoke and watching it leisurely, while his thoughts seemed to be pleasantly occupied. "Yes " exclaimed he, " on the whole, I prefer that Rosa- lind should marry Charles [Hunting, because he is her first love.

He paused again, gave a long whiff, and then commenced   OR, OURA DES7TINY.       63 to smoke more rapidly to suit the train of his 'Iying thoughts, and again resumed, speaking to himself: "I would like to see Otto and hear from his own lips hIow he has passed his wedding tour. I hope he had a more pleasant time of it than I had. Theodosia made a perfect valet of me. I had to wait on her like a princess, and indulge all her caprices and a thousand unreasonable demands and re- marks. I made a mistake then and there, when I did not draw the line and determine, once for all, how far I could be commanded and abused, and make an effort to command that respect which is due to a husband." At those words he threw the cigar impetuously away, exclaiming, "It has been a mistake, a great mistake, for which I have paid dearly!" He stepped to the window, which had a full view of the street for a great distance. "Yes, it's he. But how measured his step. is! What a deep gloom rests on his face! Something serious must have happenled, for Otto is generally able to suppress trouble so that none can read it in his face. I feel uneasy. Let me )prepare myself for unpleasant news.

And in a mournful voice the son-in-law told all that had happened since his arrival at home ; the objection of his wife to ride in a hack in her native city; her objection to reside on picturesque Rox Street; objecting to the house as not being grand enough and the neighborhood as not as fashionable as she expected.

"Yes, pay anything for adoration and admiration, peace of mind, peace of home, comfort, health, and even honor ; all that is clear and sacred to life, all in order to make a grand display and excite the envy of the neighbors," exclaimed the son-in-law, with great disdain.

"I cannot make a sacrifice," answered the son-in-law    t thoughtfully. "You call it a sacrifice to accept from the parents of  your wife, for whose future welfare you seem to be so much concerned, a comfortable home in a neighborhood where  the most refined reside, and which is suitable for your posi- tion in society; and that gift is offered to you by me with the tenderest affection, and which I press on your accept- ance for the sake of peace. Surely you cannot and you should not call it a sacrifice, but a pleasant duty and a token of affection." "I would gladly acquiesce, but it is a sacrifice, and in- deed too great." "I don't demand of you a sacrifice, but what I expect of you is sincerity. If you are sincere in your affection toward your wife, and if you are sincerely attached to her parents, then you should not insist upon a residence on Rox Street when the welfare of your wife and her parents requires, a house on Clinton Heights."

The yo ung husband leaned over the back of a chair, lost in deep reverie, while the father-in-law gazed through the window to the sky, curling his mustache nervously. He abruptly turned round, took a few steps toward his son-in-law, and a(ddressed him in a commanding attitude and voice. "Otto-or Mr. Wehlen, if you prefer it--tfhere are mo- ments in a man's life when the whole future is to be de- cided--' to be or not to be' the successful man, the fortu- nate man, the happy man, the representative man, the man who leads, who elevates, and who in return is elevated by his fellow-men." "I am aware of it," remarked the son-in-law. "I have not finished, sir," was the quick response, and Mr. Ia Monte continued in the same tone: 'Such mo- ments, such an epoch, I may call it, only occur once in a man's life.

"My new father!-or Mr. La Monte, if you prefer my calling you so-please do not excite yourself; be calm, and - hear me " begged the son-in-law eagerly, -and continued: "I relmember nothng of my early childhood so distinctly as when you came into our poorly furnished room in a crowded  tenement-house, spoke to my mother, who, after you left, drew re near her, threw herself on her knees, prayed fervently, while a fountain of tears streamed from her eyes. She took me to . Mrs. Goldrick, and from that day I hardly ever had a chance of seeing my mother; either she was not at home when I called, or I was not at home when she called. Years rolled on, and when I became a man, and asked you about the welfare of my mother, you assured me that, al- though she was the superintendent of the household affairs, she  was treated as one of the family, and felt happy and con- tented. That assurance from you, and my mother's taci- turnity on subjects concerning her and the past, made Ime take it for granted that it was so.- But alas! only of-late have I learned that my poor mother was not the superin- tendent of your household, but the very pack-horse of the   OR, OUR DESTINY.        71 family, who had not only to toil, but also submit to the very hard taunts which Mrs. La Monte's unreasonable whims dictated, and all that-and more, perhaps, than that -mly poor maother suffered for my sake, that I might remain under your protection, and gain your favor for the sake of her sufferings, and of all of vhich I was kept systematically in ignorance." He lpaused, wrung his hands, and exclaimed: "Would to God that you had never called at our humble home! My mother would never have suffered as she did; and I, if not as educated as I am, would at least have ful- filled the duties of a son toward his mother, and would not have felt the mortification of having been duped. These thoughts caused my silence to your question, whether I feel such a friendship for you as an elevated feeling of gratitude would dictate." The father-in-law listened with awe. He never expected to hear such words from his prot6ge, whom he had rescued from the lowest strata of society and helped to make what he was. "Ing-atitude is the world's reward," he thought. "The thousand benefits that this young man and his mother -have received from my hands are forgotten, and I am even hated for a small real or imaginary wrong. Shall I be angry with him? No! fools are angry; wise men forgive or forget, and reconcile themselves to the force of circumstances, and by their wisdom turn every enemy into a useful friend. I must never forget that I am John James La Monte, who hates to be defeated and act the part of a fool. I must rule, and rule I can only through calmness and wisdom." Turning tow- ard his son-in-law, he said, "I admire your frankness; it pleases me, for it convinces me that I have not misjuldged you'; you are of a noble nature, or you would not feel as you do in behalf of your excellent mother, and be so frank in pointing out to me a wrong which I had inflicted on you and your parent; but let me prove to you that the wrong is olly  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7121-00000037"/> imaginary on your part, and not real; in fact, I admit that soon after my marriage it was mly misfortune to be unable to retain servants, for to keep servants and make them do their duty to the fullest extent, and pleasantly, requires a diplomacy of a high order, \vhich Mrs. La Monte at her age and inexperience did not then possess ; and being harassed by the continual change of servants, I started out to find some person that would stay and do the work without entailing on my wife the art of diplomacy. Thus I found your mother. She came into my house not only poor, very poor, but also very illiterate. At first she had to work very hard, and stand somel pretty sharp scolding, but I made no secret of it when I engaged her; however, gradually she learned the shady side of Mrs. La Monte, avoided it, and by her tact brought out the sunny rays, and her task became every day pleas- anter.  Other servants were engaged and were under her direct control. As the children advanced in age, I engaged the best masters to give them lessons, and insisted upon their being always given in the plresence of your mother, who im- proved the opportunity and became an apt scholar.  She now speaks, as you are aware, the purest English, under- stands French and Geriman, and reads the three languages fluently and with a clear comprehension.  She made good use of my extensive library, and knows Shakespeare, Goethe, Schiller, Milton, and other great poetical works by heart; she is well versed in history, and as for the Bible, she can recite the most admirCed passages from memory. While she was thus storing her mind with a weaith of knowledge, I was making her wealthy financially, for my remuneration was not only liberal, but I kept it invested at every favor- able opportunity, and when she left my house she bought 'and paid for her pleasant homestead, and has yet to her credit the sum of thirty-six thousand dollars, as the secret archives of the bank will show, and which, as cashier, will   73 nlow come under your care. Compare her preselt position, ladylike appearance and bearing, her own house and her resoiurces, with her former position, and it will forcibly im- press upon you the fact that, ritenout my aid and good-will, she never couIld have attained it; and you yourself, instead of becoming a street Arab, drifting perhaps into a chiannel f of vice, have grown up tiunder my protection and guidance, tLhe  ! orderly youth, the promising young man, the man with brigtft prospects, who is respected and courted by the best of our society." "You have mly warmest thanks and ly most loyal grati- tude for all you did for me and my mother, and I lhole that we have always provedourselves worthy of your protection, guidance, and good-will." "You have, you have," was the quick rejoinder; " and because you and your mother lave been obedient to my . will, and left yolurselves without much questio6ning to my  guidance, it was plossible for mne to achieve for you sucl  gran d success. Now abandon yourself henceforth, as you  lave done in the past, to mly guidance, and you will be ICell rewarded., A knock was heard at the dloor. Colme in,l" answere Jr. La Monte, and Peter entered; this time not the " ab- )ling Peter," but "Peter the Silent," who quietly and with n obedient mien handed his master a letter, which Mr. La fonite quickly opened as he recognized the handivriting o le envelope. The letter was short, but shot as it was, iade, nevertheless, that strong-willed ma'n quiver; it ran us: " DEAR PAPA :-Please come home immediately; your 'esence is an imperative necessity.

"Yes, sir." "Bring my buggy, and on your way stop and bringnme a  box of M. Haas' Havana Regalia cigars," handing him at the same time ten dollars. After Peter was gone, Mr. La Monte proceeded: "Otto, I invite you and Viola to tea this evening. Now follow me; I wish to introduce you to the employes of the  bank as the cashier ;" and offering Otto his arm, he stepped with him into the centre of the banking hall, tapped a'bell, and called out in a clear voice: "Gentlemen in your vari.  ous capacities, I have the pleasure of introducing to you Mr. Otto Wehlen, who has been unanimously clected cashier of this bank, and who in my absence will also act as presi-  dent of this institution. I request you to extend to him the same courtesy and good-will whch you, have done to me;" ;.  and handing to his son-in-law the safe-keys, he departed with  a bow. The buggy vas already before the door. "have placed the cigars below the seat," said Peter.  ",et me see whether they are genuine."          Yes, sir, they are: I bought them from the old gentleman  himself."                         , "Did you? Nevertheless let me see them."  Peter brought forth the box, which Mr. La Monte ex- amined. "Yes, they are genuine: the best." Seating himself ili the buggy, and taking the reins, he gave the spirted horse a slight touch with the whip, and whirled -- out of sight. Peter watched him carefully, and said, "I T-e cannot fi0ol me ; his lquestioning about the hlorse being shod, his ordr- inig the cigars, slowly examiinig thie to see whether tley    ..*.    75 were genuine. This was all said and done to make tne and Otto believe that the letter he received was of little im- portance. Something must be up at the house. ittwas Miss Rosalind's 'handwriting, and she would not summon her father during business hours if it were not absolutely neces- sary to have him at holme. Mr. La Monte is now very rich, and even the president of the same bank heentered as a poor boy; but I'll be flogged if 1 would change with himi, if my wife were like his. She is a rouser, or my name isn't Peter. But now let me go into the bank and congratulate Otto on his good luck in being now cashier; that boy worked himself up. I only hope that Viola will not turn out like her mother. That would spoil it ali; for a man  without a good wife is like a man paralyzed : he breathes and that is about all. They call me a talkative fool, but I know I amn right in saying that a man without having a good wife has but little joy in life." With those words on his lips, he reached the cashier's desk, and found Otto sur-roltndod by all the emnployes delighted to see him in the bank again, all asking about his wed(ding tour, which the new cashier clut short by saying plleasantly, "Gentlemen, this house is con- secrated to business: we have no right to deprive it of one minute by idleness. Let us all go now to work, and at some future day we will have a social gathering. If there are any applications for discount, please hand me the papers and also the correspondence which requires my attention." At those few words, all repaired to their respective desks. Peter alone stood and looked at the young cashier with adm,,;ilrin eyes, and said, "I have nothing to do. Let me congrathlte you now: may you always' plrosper, and lmay every body love and admice you as well as Peter, the old bank portr-, does." "Thanll you, Peter," said the cashier, examilning varliols notes offered for discount. "()ne thing nlore before I leave: tell 1e mwhether I shall call you hereafter Otto or Mr. Wehlen.'

None in the bank knew that voice so we'll as the young cashier. He sprang to his feet, and exclaimed, "Mrs. Goldrick, here I am; please step this way. Be seated. What has brought you here in such haste?"  "O dear! I am suffocating. How close the air is in the city, compared with it upon Rox Street. Besides, I have been running for fear I should miss you, for I would like to have you come home at once, your mother -feels ioorly." "My mother unwell!" gasped the son ; " quick, tell me, has anything happened? I left her well. What ails her? Did you send for a doctor before you came?" "'She complains of feeling faint, and requested me to go and tell you that she wishes to see you inmmediately. Her paleness alarmed nme so that I ran down to get you, and never thought of stopping for a doctor." "Peter, get a carriage for Mrs. Goldrick to take her home ;" and with those words Mr. Wehlen hurried fromi the bank in- to the street, called the first hack that he met, and gave direc- tions to drive to Doctor Dettman's. The doctor w;as about to take his after-dinner nap. "Sorry to disturb you, doctor, but I have received a message that mly mother is sick; please come at once. Do not lose time in putting on your boots; your slippers will do; I have a coach before your door." "Why such haste? Is it anything serious?" "That is just what I am in a hurry to find out. Please, doctor, oblige me by stepping into the carriage without further change of apparel." No, you must wait until I slip on my boots ; it may rain, and in that case slippers will not do, although you have a carriage at my disposal." Adjusting his spectacles, taking the slate and pencil, he   OR, OUR DESTINY. -       " wrote in a firm, bold hand, "Will be back soon." "Now my hat and cane, which are in the hall, and I am ready." Step- ping into the carriage, Mr. Wehlen gave the driver directions, bidding him to drive as fast as he could to Rox Street and stop at. No. 214. "Where is Rox Street?" asked the doctor. "Rox Street is in the northern part of the city, beautifully situated, has a romantic view of the town, the river, and the adjacent hills. It is a delightful place of residence for quiet, unassuming citizens, and is within easy reach of the business portion of the city." "The city is growing so rapidly that I am almost getting to be a stranger in it. It is wonderful how every spot is made available for building, and'those hills, which once were thought worthless, have become the most beautiful places of residence. We have reason to be proud of our achieve- ments, having turned a rugged wilderness into the garden- spot of the continent." "So we have; still it is only an outline of what it will be thirty years hence, when our water and railroad facilities are fully developed, our parks completed, and our street im- provements under the direction of one clear-headed, upright, and practical engineer, the paving of the streets not done per- haps so scientifically as now, but based on good common- sense principles, and honestly carried out-" "Ah!" interrupted the doctor, " you are too sanguine ; you expect too much." The carriage gave a violent jerk in one of the holes on the street, dislodging the doctor's spectacles, which he quickly caught and carefully adjusted. "You expect too much," repeated he. "In this egotistical age some one would lose the grip on the public crib by such a wise and system- atic course. You see, this street on which we now ride was paved only six weeks ago.. I passed over it in my buggy, and was pleased with its smoothness. Iardly was it finished, when  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7121-00000040"/> 783      TIE F ORCIVING KISS;"  the water-works had to tear it up and lay a larger main pipe. They have now finished, and in this morning's paper I read that the sewer commissioners have decided to build the sewer in this street, so that it will be torn up again, and then there is a chance for the contractors to draw handsomely from the public treasury at any time, and the taxes are rap-  idly increasing, for which we get discomforts in return." Yes, the taxes are getting enormously high ; I 'am paying on a piece of property twenty times the amount that it act- ually cost me fifteen years ago." "And where is that piece of property?" "Opposite the Grand Park entrance." What! are you the fortunate possessor of those lots op- posite the Grand Park on which it is proDos(ed to build the new hotel, and are you Mr. Otto Wehlen?" "That is my name." "I know your mother well, and I knew she had a son, but  never had the pleasure of meeting you before. Allow me to congratulate you on your marriage. I officiated at the birth of your wife, and so did your imo:ter. She did not then think that she was attending and hCelping to brillng up her filtutr daughter-in-law-but such is human life; somne would call it Providence." The carriage stopped, and Mrs. Goldrick was already waiting and exclaimed, "I am glad that you camne and brought Doctor Dettman ; your mother is anxiously awaiting yoi, and wanted to send for the doctor." "How is my dear mother?" Poorly," was the sad reply. "The son and the doctor both hastened to the sufferer. The practical eyes of the doctor quickly perceived that the attack was one of a very severe nervous prostration, which, if not very skilfully treated and carefully nursed, would prove fatal. The son became then thoroughly alarmed at the death,                   ,   OR, OUR DESTINY.         79 like paleness of his mother, and evinced plain signs of the greatest solicitude and disquietude. "Mr. Wehlen, you must now be quiet and calm. All that medical skill can do for your mother shall be done. But what she needs above all is perfect rest, freedom from all anxiety, and good nursing." Taking his watch in one hand, and feeling the pulse with the other, he then leaned over the patient to listen to the beating of the heart. After a careful examination, he tore out of his memlorandum-book a leaf, penned a prescription, handed it to the son, saying, "Please go to the nearest druggist, and wait for the medicine ; it will take several minutes to prepare it." Mrs. Wehlen beckoned the doctor and whispered, Please tell Mrs. Goldrick to go and prepare some hot water. I wish to be with you alone." The doctor didas requested, and as soon as Mrs. Goldrick was gone, Mrs. Wehlen said in a slow and measured tone and voice: "Doctor, you are aware that I am a Catholic, and always professed that religion, which I called blessed and blessing. I am still a firm believer in its beneficial teachings, but I have lost faith in its ministers. Instead of being like their immortal Master, humble, full of pity, piety, forgiveness, and the teachers of peace, they are become and are vain, arrogant, unforgiving, disingenuous, and mercenary. Nothing is too low for them to stooD to in order to gain their selfish ends. With this my candid opinion of the priests, it will not sur- prise you that I decline to make a confession to a priest of my own church."  There the invalid paused ; a heavy sigh escaped her bosom, and after a few imoments of rest she con- tinued: '"1 feel that my hour is drawing near when 1my soul will depart from my body; but before I become the re- pulsive thing without a soul, 1 wish to impart to you a secret, not for my sake, but for the sake of my only son., Please  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7121-00000041"/> 8o      "T THE FORGIVING KISS;" bend your ear down to my lips. I am exhausted, I cannot speak loud, and besides, none shall hear it. You are now as my priest: to you I confess, and you are at liberty to make use of my confession if you think it best." "Mrs. Wehlen, there is no need of your making a confes- sion to me. You will, I hope, recover, and live many years  yet," said the kind-hearted doctor feelingly. "No, doctor, my nerves are unstrung, and I feel that I am sinking : sinking into the grave. Be quick, and bend your ears to mle." The doctor listened, and his calm, intellectual face be- came flushed with anger, and the words "base 1 degrading! dastardly!" escaped his compressed lips. "Please, Mrs. Wehlen, say nothing more, or you will be- come so prostrated that there will be no help for you; I know enough." "Not yet; I must tell you all," whispered the dying     womnan.  "My professional duty commands me to insist on your silence and rest. Please be quiet," pleaded the dloctor au- thoritatively. "I will feel better, and die with greater resignation if I completely unbosom myself," observed Mrs. Wehlen in an imploring tone. "Then proceed briefly!" said the doctor almost in anger. But Mrs. Wehlen could not proceed. Her pent-up grief needed and found relief in tears, which deprived her for the nmoment of speech, and which the doctor carefully watched. "Now that will do ; calm yourself, Mrs. Wehlen ; your son  is coming." O' God! be with me, or send Thy kind messengers in this my hour of trial and desolation!" exclaimed the sufferer feebly. "God is with you, for your soul still lives in your body,   Ut, auunlc rJ1lV Yvy,     8I and the tears you now Nrweep are His kind messengers; they are the dew-drops of the soul that permit the spirit to rule cheerfully over the flesh 1" said the doctor, for his profession and his nature had taught him the arts of consolation. "How learned are your words, doctor! Be the friend of my son! Let Otto enjoy your friendship, your confidence, and share in your wisdom." "I will endeavor to befriend him for your sake, for his sake, and for the sake of a common brotherhood. But now do please be quiet; I am glad that your son is heie, and the medicine at hand." Otto stepped into the room with the medicine, a soup- spoon, and tumbler of water in his hands, the perspiration streaming down from his brow, while the deepest anxiety was depicted on his face. "How is my mother, doctor?" "About the same. Please let me have the bottlej and go call Mrs. Goldrick." The doctor took the bottle, shook the contents well, and gave the patient a spoonful, saying, "I I urgently request you to keep yourself perfectly quiet; try to forget the past, and do not be anxious about the future. Let Mrs. Gold- rick attend to you, and your son go about his business." Mrs. Goldrick now stepped into the room, and the doc- tor addressed her: '"You will please remain in the room with Mrs. Wehlen. Every hour you will give her a spoonful of this medicine; shake the bottle well before you pour it into the spoon. But in case Mrs. Wehlen should sleep, do not awake her.

"The malady is not yet fully developed. I will come again this evening about nine o'clock, and would like to meet you here ; will you ride down town with me?" "Indeed I will 1" exclaimed the son, feeling the safe-keys in his pocket; "I will just bid good-by to my dear mother."  "Tell Mrs. Goldrick that you will be back soon, and do  not speak to your mother; she needs undisturbed repose." Mrs. Goldrick stepped on tiptoe from the sick-room, say- ing, "Otto, your mother is asleep. What do you want for supper?" "Never mind the supper; just remain in the room with my mother until I come back. I shall not be long." The doctor was impatient, which Mr. Wehlen observed, and hastened into the hack, but paid the driver before taking his seat, instructing the man to drive first to the doctor's.  The carriage rolled smoothly on, and the observant doc- tor remarked, "This street seems to be excellently paved."' "Yes, it seems to be a good job of macadamizing on a well-graded bottom, Awith ample cover of good gravel. The controlling property-owner of this street had a good deal of trouble with it. He had it splendidly graded about two years ago, but before having the street macadamized, he applied to the board of trustees of the city works to lay the pipes, which they promised, and actually delivered the supply water- pipes on the street, where they remained for six successive weeks before they had them laid; after they had them down in the ground, the heavy fall and winter weather set in, and it became too late to set the curbstone and macadamize the street, which was thus only graded over the fall and spring months. The water made sad havoc with it, washing down an immense amount of earth from the adjoining hills, and cutting deep ravines in some parts of the street, which made it necessary to grade the street again, which was done.   OR, OUR DESTINY.        83 But now the gas-piples are to be laid before the street is paved. The application was made to the gas company, but the gas coinpany would not lay their gas mains unless the city ordered gas-lamps on the street. Application was made by the board of common council, and a resolution intro- duced to instruct the city engineer to stake the gas lamp- posts on Rox Street, as the contract for paving was about to be given out, to have gas-pipes laid before said street was paved." "Such resolution is business-like; for a street that is worth grading and paving is entitled to be lighted at night," ob- served the docto'r. "Common-sense would so dictate, but one of the city leg- islators jumped utp who had more impudence than brain; made a speech against the resolution; it ought to be re- ferred to the Committee on Light. The member who intro- duced the resolution had the brain but 'not the pluck to combat the noisy and impudent demagogue, who was a hin- drance to practical work." "And what did the Coiimittee on ,ight do?" inquired the doctor. "' Reported favorably, no doubt?" "The chairman of the Committee on Light had it now in his power to have the gas-pipes laid on Rox Street or not, and the property-owners called on that chairman. They found him to be as difficult to approach as the Czar of all the Russias, and when they were honored with an audience, they found him as overbearing, and perhaps more so, than that potentate. He would at some future dlay take the matter under advisement. His public duties were so great, he said, that he could not say when it would be convenient for him to give it his attention; he would, however, endeavor to think of it." "You are mistaken in calling that member who wished that resolution referred to the Committee on Light an impu-  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7121-00000043"/> 84      "THE FOR GIZVIG KISS;" dent fellow: le was a rascal, and expected to share in the  bribe that the chairman of the Committee on Light was fish-  ing for," remarked the doctor. The conversation was at this point interrupted, for the car-  riage drove over a villanously paved, worn-out Nicholson  pavement, full of dangerous holes, and the occupants-of the carriage had to watch in order to balance themselves as the carriage jerked. At last a crash was heard, and the car- riage broke down in one of the holes; the horsesbecame frightened and pulled the broken vehicle along; the driver held on to the reins whih an iron grip, and called out with might and main for help. Otto Wehlen wanted to jump from the carriage, but the calln, collected doctor kept him back, sayinig, "You are ; : safer in the hack than in jumping out." A few stalwart pedestrians seeing the misfortune of the  hackman hastened to his assistance, grasped the horses, and brought them to a stand-still.  The occupants of the carriage were only too glad to get out and avail themselves of the street-car.  The hackinan lamented, and in his agony called loudly out, '"Six years I have worked hard as a porter, saved every cent that I could, bought this turn-out to be my own boss and support my family better than I did, but now, alas! the carriage is broken; the horses frightened and used to run.  I am a ruined man." "Not at all, not at all," said one of the bystanders; "you can sue the city: it is a clear case. It is the duty of the city to keep the street in a passable condition ; it is full of holes. You broke down your hack on that account, therefore the  city must pay your damage. It is a clear case, a clear case. Call at my office." "ord save me from the tempter!" interrupted the hack-  man. "I have heard enough in my days of the clear cases and I i    Ufa, u  U/ ILz. I 1.

The words were hardly spoken when they were sealed by a square blow from the fist of the lawyer, which was readily returned, and which grew into a regular street fight; each of the belligerents havin'g friends, one party claiming that the hack-driver was wrong to speak as he did, while the other party claimed that the lawyer had no right to hit. Angry words ended in blows, which were cut short by the police, who arrested the hackman, the lawyer, and a few of the most turbulent, and dispersed the rest. The doctor reached his comfortable house in safety, and related to his amiable wife the incident of the break-down 6f the hack. She listened with great sympathy. Aviolent pull of the door-bell was given, which the doctor himself an- swered. "Glad to find you at home, doctor! Quick! read this let- ter, there is not a moment to be lost." "Who sends you?" asked the doctor, noticing the livery of the man. "John James La Monte, Esquire," answered the servant proudly. "Now I recognize you; yes, yes. Step in; I will read the message." "Doctor, please be quick; my horses are foaming with sweat; they will catch cold by standing long." *"I will. Be seated," pointing to a chair in the hall, and walking into his office, where his wife met him and anxiously inquired who had called in such hot haste. ":The coach- man of Mr. John James La Monte brought me this letter: let me read it to you;" and breaking the seal the doctor read:  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7121-00000044"/> 86      "TIE FORGIVING KISS;" "My DEAR DOCTOR DETTMAN: "Your professional skill and friendship are greatly needed in my house. Oblige me by accepting my equipage as your conveyance. The bearer of this is a reliable coachman.-With great respect, Yours, "LA MONTE." "Very kind to send his equipage, but I prefer to drive out in my own buggy ; my horse is not so fast, but he is safe," remarked the doctor as if speaking to himself. "But this seems to be an urgent call, and every moment's delay may prove fatal," observed the mistress of the house; "shall I get your medicine-chest and instrument-case?  "Yes, dear, I will take both with me ; but I am not decided whether to tlrust myself under the care of that coachman. He may be an expert whip, but these young horses are indeed dangcrous on our bad roads. My old horse got used to our horribly paved streets, and knows how to avoid the bad places with military precision." A knock was heard at the door, and the coachman thrust his head into the room, exclaiming, "Please, doctor, hurry; my horses are getting restless." "Are they? Then just drive home, and tell your master I will come soon in my buggy."    ' "My orders are to bring you in our team, and I would not dare to drive home without you, for they are awaiting you with great anxiety. I have never seen Mr. La Monte look so pale and troubled. Please, doctor, just step into the carriage or let me lift you in," exclaimed he, stretching out his arms. "'Thank you ; I have my own limbs, and am anxious to preserve thnem ; that is the reason I prefer to ride in my Cown conveyance." /   OR, OUR DESTINY.         87 "Then you are afraid to ride in the carriage when under my charge?" asked the astonished coachman bluntly. "Exactly so; your horses are restless, and you seem to share their spirit," was the prompt reply. "Yes, doctor, they are restless ; but let me get the reins in my hand once and they will be as docile as lambs. If Sis- ter Hulda is not afraid to ridein the carriage when I drive, nont need be afraid, for she is the greatest coward I know. I wish she were in Jericho." This last sentence was said in an undertone, which the doctor did not at first seem to hear, but at the name Sister Hulda he seemed to be electrified, and for a moment almost bewildered; then exclaiming quickly, "My medicine chest and case!" he lifted the lid of the box, glanced to see whether all the instruments were in their places, kissed his wife, and said, "( I may not come home before to-morrow morning. If I am wanted anywhere urgently, let the hostler call for mein my buggy with my old horse; their horses. are too fast for me." And turning to the coachman he said, "Take this chest and keep it on the bottom of your seat. Keep the chest steady, or the bottles will break and the medicine be spoiled." With this precaution, the doctor seated'himself in the superb car- riage resigned, and murmuring, "When will Americans learn the value of good roads? How long will the lives and limbs of men and animals be exposed' to the dangers and wear and tear on account of dilapidated roads? How long will this cruelty be prolonged?" The coachman, after placing the chest carefully and snugly at his feet, said to himself, "I'll be ground to powder if that old doctor is not careful of himself; is he a coward on ac- count of it? No! Fools do not care for their health and limbs, but wise men do- Get up lively!" The horses understood and started at a quick trot.  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7121-00000045"/> 88      "THE FORGIVING KISS;" While Doctor Dettman is on the road to the grand man- sion of John James La Monte, let us, thougltful reader, enter there, and see the scenes that were enacted and the changes that have taken place since the marriage of Viola.

HE  exterior looks even more inviting than when the bride at her wedding first left those imposing priemises, for the garden surrounding the building was now decked with a velvet-like green sward, and rare and costly flowers in full bloom, while the well-trimmed trees were covered with leaves and buds of a thousand hues. It was a charming sight, that pleased the poetical senses, and im- pressed the passing observer with the idea that harmony prevailed in that stately residence ; and so it would, were it not for the great vanity and the great wealth unemployed that the mistress of that enviable palace possessed. Ever since Mrs. La Monte became the heiress of one million five- twenty bonds, with all the coupons attached, she was less  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7121-00000046"/> o90      TIE FORGIVING KISS;" contented to be only the plain Mrs. John James La Monte, whose mother-in-law was a washerwonan, and that her darling daughter Viola should have married plain Otto Weh- len, a bank teller, whose mother had been cook and house- keeper. These thoughts were therefore bitterness. She would often exclaim, "Why did I give my consent to that hateful marriage? Why did I not travel abroad with my daughters, who, no doubt, through their great beauty, ac- complishments, and wealth, would have secured a Baron, a Count, a Lord, or perhaps even a Prince for a husband?"It was a great mistake--a mistake, she thought, that lowered her and her daughters in standing and dignity. Her Viola was only Mrs. Otto Wehlen, and Rosalind in love with Charles Hunting, whom she vowed to marry or remain unmarried for life. What prospects! What poor prospects! to be only the mother-in-law of a money-changer, or a shop- keeper, when she might have been the mother-in-law of a Baron or a Prince, who would have bestowed on her the title of a Baroness or Princess. It was a galling mistake, that lhaunted her like an uneasy conscience. "Whose fault is it?" exclaimed she. That such a mistake was made, was the fault of her husband and Mrs. Wehlen. Why did he ever cross her path--she, the born Bottwell, who had been created to dwell at royal courts, and he only a La Monte, with a plebeian nature, contented to dwell among neighbors who are no better or worse, who plods on, and will plod on all the days of his life, and at the end will feel happy to have his daugh- ters married to a mere Otto Wehlen and a Charles Hunting! Wlhat a fate! Often did Mrs. La Monte walk in her garden and under the shade of the trees, lamenting that she and her daughters had married below their dignity. This lamentation had its effect, for there was a growing coldness between the hus-   OR, OUR DESTINY.        91 band and wife, and Mrs. Wehlen was now openly hated by Mrs. La Monte, which made her presence unendurable. She therefore decided to commence housekeeping, and en- joy the fruits of her labor. Mrs. Wehlen communicated her decision to Miss Rosa- lind, who wept and implored her to stay. She pleaded tearfully, "You have so long been the peacemaker between my parents; you alone could bring back my mother to the path of reason and harmony! Remain at least until Viola and my brother-in-law return, and then we will all endeavor to make ma happy." But Mrs. Wehlen shook her head, and sadly said, "For the sake of peace, and for your sake, I would prolong my stay ; but, alas! my strength is vanished; I am no longer able to stand the work. I have not now the requisite energy to manage and keep your mother in check; besides that, she hates me, and would no longer allow me to appeal to her better nature." Rosalind buried her face in her hands, and exclaimed, "Sad! sad that we have to part i Take with you my most grateful thanks for the thousand favors you have bestowed on us, for the thousand sacrifices that you have made in our behalf: for I know that it is you who have attended us in the hour of sickness and danger; I know it is you who have received the poisoned-arrow words from my unhappy mother that would otherwise have been heaped on my good father. To your palliation and resignation we owe not only our position, I believe, but the appearance of a happy family be- fore society. Shall we retain it after you are no longer under our roof?" "With God's help you will! But you must now be the ministering angel," said Mrs. Wehlen earnestly. I console when I -myself need consoling! My heart is heavy, my grief is bending me to the earth, and I long for my bed in its lap."  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7121-00000047"/> 92      "THE FORGIVING KISS; " At these words a fresh flood of tears streamed from the lovely eyes of the graceful Rosalind. ' To my heart! to my heart, then!" cried Mrs. Wehlen nervously, outstretching her arms, in which the lovely maiden quickly reposed and wept vehemently. "Weep, my child, even be they tears of shame " said Mrs. Wehlen in a broken voice. Hardly were these words spoken when the unhappy Rosalind sprang back, and looked at her aged friend in dis- may, and disdainfully said, "Is it possible that you, who know me from  infancy, should doubt my purity, my honor?" "A thousand thanks for your words! what a relief do I feel!" exclaimed Mrs. Wehlen happily, and continued: Your words! my heart is heavy! My grief is bending me to the earth ; 1 long for its bcd in my grave; and your vehe- ment weeping forced on my mind the most crushing thoughts. Thanks to our Heavenly Father that your tears are not the tears of shame! that you are still chaste and pure, and have no right to lament as you do, for your soul is pure and will shed its heavenly ray within you, and make you, single or lovingly mated, a happy being. Speak! tell ine all!-why are you bent down with grief, provided you still think me worthy of your confidence?" "My dear Mrs. Welilen, I have no secrets with you, and still I cannot repeat to you what I have said to my dear darling Charles, that now so heavily rests on my spirit," answered Rosalind with a deep blush. "Two are better able to carry a load-especially a load of grief-than one ; let me help to carry your burden. Bodily J am weak, but my spirit is strong. I feel strong. I will close my eyes and listen," said Mrs. Wehlen almost in a whisper. Rosalind hesitatingly said, that soon after Charles   OR, OUR DESTINY.        93 Hunting returned home, he sought an interview which she granted. Under yonder venerable oaks he pleaded guilty of his misconduct, threw himself on his knees, begged her forgiveness, and stepped forward to receive from her a 'for- giving kiss. At that moment the enormity of his behavior flashed before her mind-ihe, the man she loved, and with whom she had exchanged vows of love, to have trifled with the vows of endearment and marriage engagement, and be- come the visitor and companion of the outcasts of society, where he not only forfeited his manly honor, but became addicted to vicious habits! He appeared to be a culprit that deserved no pardon, and she waived him back with the words, "Touch me not!  "Touch me not!" indeed she had said, with an almost imperial gesture of disdain and horror. "Touch me not!" and she remembered her words, although even in that moment of excitement she shrank from their repetition even to her kind friend. They had been indeed bitter, and had, perhaps, been due to momentarily startled indignation, rather than drawn from the very depths of her heart. But  we mnay pierce behind the veil and tell again the words which, in their passionate intensity, had sounded almost like a curse. She had said, "Touch me'not! for I am a virgin. Touch me not! for thy lips and thy body are impure. You have embraced creatures who for a price allow them- selves to be loved by thieves, housebreakers, and cut-throats, by murderers, and all kinds of degraded human beings. Touch me not! for you are impure.  Nature demands seven years to renew the crust of the human body, and seven years you must wait for that kiss. If I find that you have for seven years truly repented, and become an honora- ble man, in the fullest sense of the word, then I will gladly forgive you; and if you then ask me to become your wife, I will marry and love you with my whole heart and my whole  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7121-00000048"/> 9      "TIZE FORGIVING KISS ;" soul ;" and without another word she had left him as if rooted to the spot. He seemed thunderstruck as he listened and saw my at- titude, for my whole being, soul and body, sanctioned the rebuke. He staggered and fell to the earth; pale as a corpse I left him there, and have not seen him since. Have I acted justly? Have I not overstepped the bounds of mod- esty? Will my action reform him, or throw him into a deeper pit of pollution? These questions and fears are making my heart sad and embittering my existence." Mr. Wehlen's sad and careworn countenance changed and beamed with joy and happiness as she listened, and gleefully exclaimed, "My darling Rosalind, your tale has made me twenty years younger. You have not only acted justly, but nobly, in the broadest conception. Would to God that there were more maidens like you, who have the moral courage to rebuke and refuse to associate with a man that is ilmmoral, for man has no more right to be immoral than woman.  If society does not as strictly demand pure morality of men, it shows plainly that that community has not sufficiently advanced in the scale of civilization, and that it has not shaken off a relic of barbarism that drags it down to the level of savagery ; but the day is dawning when man will cease to be immoral with impunity. A few more such lessons as you have given your Charles will have a benefi- cial effect. Have no fears of the result. Your Charles will reform ; he will see his errors, and strive diligently to be- come worthy of you. As to whether you have overstepped the bounds of modesty by the words you have uttered, I think not. Those are words that will live in the memory of him who deserves to hear them, and if they reform him, then they were golden words, for they will secure you a virtuous hus!a1nd, with whoml you will thuild u a castle of happiness that no enemy can invadel. I ie will live for you alone, and   OR, OUR DESTINY.        95 you will rejoice in his love, You will be a mint of affection, a mint of hope, and with God's blessing will find yourself surrounded by a progeny as lovable-" Mrs. Wehlen could not finish the sentence, for Rosalind blushingly laid h1er hand on her lips, threw her arms Lound( her neck, and wept tears of relief and hope. The door opened suddenly, and Mrs. La Monte stepped in, elaborately dressed and adorned with costly jewels, add- ing greatly to the imposing presence of her commanding form, and she would have been really beautiful if peace, kindness, and charity had dwelt in her heart; but her dis- contentment and want of charity made an unfavorable im- pression on her otherwise regular and classical features. "Again in Mrs. Wehlen's room! Your arms again round her neck and weeping!" exclaimed Mrs. La Monte, in an angry tone ; and she continued "I hope that I shall soon be relieved from such a sight, and that Mrs. Wehlen will now go lhousekeeping on her own account. She can afford it since her son is become a millionnaire-a millionnaire on paper," repeated she, with a sarcastic laugh ; a laughter that made the blood freeze in the veins of Mrs. ;Wehlen, who ineekly answered, "I have just taken leave of Rosalind, Whose good and grateful nature makes her weep at my de- parture." "Good and grateful she is to you, but to me, her mother, she is unkind and ungrateful, for she does not mind me. Heed mv advice to give up the thoughts of ever marrying Charles Hunting, a gambler, a libertine, an outcast! How my daughter could love such a reprobate is more than I can comlprehend, especially if a nobleman like Count Carl Muller Vo'n Mardeck is making  overtures to her! I)Daghter, do not throw yourself away, but ilmprove your grand chance, and become the Countess Von Mardeck," cried MArs. La Monte, with great energy.  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7121-00000049"/> 96      "THEI FORGIVING KISS;" Mother, you distress me! Please do not lower my be- loved Charles in my estimation. Make mle hope he will re- form, his whole nature will change, and he will become one of nature's noblemen. In that hope I am his betrothed, and if that expectation should become blest with realization I will be his wife, for my heart he possesses, and my hand shall be given to whom my heart leads me," pleaded Rosa- lind, with tears. "Foolish girl! to trifle with the fairest prospects of be- coming the Countess Von Mardeck," remarked the mother angrily. "We will speak of this some other time and in calmer moments. Now please go to your room. Change your costume. I have directed the maid to have your blue cord- ed silk reception-dress ready, and to replace the cut steel buttons with diamond studs. She will also adorn your head- toilet with the pearl coronet, and place a diamond star in the centre. It is a jewel which you have not yet seen, and which I had made expressly for you. I think it will become you admirably. Be quick, daughter, for I am expecting grand visitors, and I wish you to appear to your best advan- tage. Do, for once, please your mother, and trust in my wis- dom to secure your future welfare." Rosalind cast a mournful glance at Mrs. Wehlen, who quickly noticed and comprehended its meaning, and re- marked, "It is proper that you should assist your mother to receive and entertain visitors." "I have no objection to that, but what I dislike is to dress so grandly: it shows bad taste, for it conveys the idea that we try to outshine our visitors, while good taste dictates that we should do all in our power to have our guests appear to their best advantage." "'This is an old-maidenish view. Your mother knows best what is right and proper. Just dress in the best you have on such occasions ; there is nothing like appearing to   OR, OUR DESTI'y         9 97 our best advantage when called upon, especially when the visitors are of the titled nobility, as our visitors to-day will be--the Count Carl Von Mardeck and his beautiful and acconmplished sister, the Countess Augustine,' remarked Mrs. La bMonte proudly. "Will her husband accompany her?", asked Rosalind thoughtfully. "Of course he will. Captain Augustus Hunting is so much in love with his wife that he is her constant compan- ion. Happy man, to be the husband of the charming count- ess! But now, daughter, ask me no more questions, and do not tarry. Try to be ready to receive them when they ar- rive. I like to have you by my side to aid me in the recep- tion. It is a great task, especially to receive such distin- guished personages. Let me now see whether the reception- saloon and parlors are in order." And Mrs. La Monte left the room as abruptly as she had entered it. "Mrs. Wehlen, please come and assist me to dress; per- haps it is for the last time that I will have the honor and thS pleasure of being waited upon by you, my dear, dear friend. How my heart aches at the thought that we must 'part and no longer live under one roof, no longer pray together and cheer each other with words of hope and consolation! I shall miss you in my hours of devotion, I shall miss you in my hours of joy and sorrowV." "Though parted, I will be constantly with you. I will pray for you and implore divine aid in your trials, for trials you m1ust expect. But remain firm, and trust in the grace of our Heavenly Father, who shields and protects the meekest and weakest of His creatures. He will also protect you. Have courage to do your duty, and remember, to the coura- geous haIp)iness belongs. Now come, and always look up." Thlley reached Rosalind's apartment, and the costly gar- Iments and jewels were spread onl the table and on the bureau,  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7121-00000050"/> 98      "TIIE FORGIVING KISS;"  while the maid was waiting to attend upon her young mis- tress. "I see that you have prepared everything. You may now go to your own room and have an hour for yourself. Mrs. Wehlen will assist mle." With a pleasant "I thank you," to Miss Rosalind, the maid retired. "I cannot express to you with what reluctance I am put- ting on these showy clothes and brilliant jewels. This single costume, with these eighteen diamond studs-thepearl coronet with the diamond star in the centre-cost not less than twenty- five thousand dollars. What a pity my mother does not place her money to a better use. Suppose she had deposited this money on interest at only six per cent., this would have real- ized annually fifteen hundred dollars; and had she given that sum to the board of trustees of the Union Relief, with the express instructions that those fifteen hundred dollars should  be expended to pay the rent for widows in very poor cir-  cumstances, what a relief this would have given to many a careworn mother when the rent becomes due-mothers who, in order to save the rent, have to clothe themselves in scanty clothes, be sparing in food and fuel, and thus become the victims of sickness and untimely death! Why does my mother not think of these things! why is she so vain and uncharitable!" exclaimed Rosalind sadly. "Because she has not been educated better. Your grand- parents were both very selfish. Old Mr. Bottwell passed all the days of his life in making money, and never gave a cent for charitable purposes. He considered everybody as a use-  less being if he could not make money out of him. And Grandmother Bottwell! Why, she would not think of any- thing else but dress and show to arouse envy-that was the aim, of her life. It is therefore not to be wondered at that your mother is vain and uncharitable. She is not to blame;   OR, OUR DESTINY.        99' she is to be pitied, for wealth to her is not a blessing. It is a pity that the ministers of our day spend what little eloquence and influence they possess on dogmas, and preach precepts by which we can reach heaven, and absolutely neglect to educate the heart to feel for the struggling poor. The conse- quences are that many of the rich are ready to spend twenty- five thousand dollars for one outfit and not twenty-five cents for charity. The heathen could not be worse than they are in that respect." Mrs. La Monte entered the room flushed with anger, for she had been eavesdropping, and heard the whole conver- sation, and exclaimed, "It is about time that you should leave my house, for a woman who will run down and try to lower a mother in the eyes of her daughter is not a fit per- son to have in the house. Begone!" "I will not part with you in anger, nor have you a right to be angry with the words which I have spoken. I have prolonged my stay at the request of Rosalind, whom I am assisting in her toilet. 'Shall I continue it?" said Mrs. Wehlen calmly. "Yes, you may," answered Mrs. La Monte in a calmer tone; and she continued: "You are right: we ought not to part in anger, considering the many years we have passed together. But I really believe that I have a right to be angry, for you have too much influence over my children, and use it to lower me in their esteem." "I know that this has been your impression for years, or you could not have treated me as harshy as you have. But God is my witness that your accusation is groundless. I have always endeavored to impress on the minds of your children the ten commandments, and none did I repeat to them so often as ' Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee'--and they do honor their parents with their  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7121-00000051"/> I00     "THE FORGIVING KISS;"  whole heart and soul. But, while they honor you, they also reason; for I taught them to reason on everything that ap- pears before their mental vision, and not to accept any- thing as right and proper before they have reflected upon and weighed it, and their reason has sanctioned it. I consider  reasoning the sentry, the safeguard against error. Reason- ing makes wise and prudent men and women; prevents them from committing grave mistakes. Those who reason are not easily to be duped; they do not accept everything as genuine coin: they must first feel its heft, and hear the clear ring before it will pass with them for what it is presented. Those who believe in glitter, in flattery, and in everything that is told them without reasoning on it first to judge whether it is right, true, and proper, are liable to be deceived. Such humnan beings are made of moonshine, and as easily melted as butter. The least cloud obscures them; the least prosperous sun-rays melt them away in excesses of over-  bearance and fastness; they are everywhere overtopped, overrun, and overthrown; the spurious beset them as the flies beset a dead carcass, and feast on them of whatever is yet left. But those who reason first before they believe, promptly reject what is spurious, and accept only what is genuine. You have a right to be proud of the sentiments that Rosalind has uttered. It is better to spend so much money for a charitable purpose, than for the gaudy clothes and flashing jewels which distort, and do not add to, true beauty; hence those who are truly beautiful and truly good disregard showy clothes and jewels, and wish the money ex- pended for nobler objects. They are content to dress plainly, and are still very handsome ; for a triumphant soul rules within them, and sheds its heavenly rays over the con- tented countenance, that has the impress of God's grace." These remarks were uttered by Mrs. Wehlen with such enthusiasm, that even Mrs. La IMonte, the born r   OR, OUR DESTINY.        IOI Bottwell, admired them, and exclaimed, I am opposed to woman mingling with worldly affairs. I believe that woman's true sphere is to adorn a home; but I believe that you, Mrs. Wehlen, would make a splendid preacher, and with your calm, convincing manner and tone could draw your hearers from earthly ambitions nearer to God. Suppose you try the pulpit?" "Anything to get rid of me," replied Mrs. Wehlen, good-naturedly; and turning to Rosalind, "Now, my dear, I will place that pearl coronet with the diamond star in the centre, and fasten it to your wealth of hair; and with that my work in this house is done." "No, not to get rid of you do I recommend you to mount the pulpit. I verily believe that one so pious, so sincere in the admiration of God and His creation, would do a vast amount of good. I confess that no minister's sermon and prayers have awakened in me such religious sentiments as your prayers and remarks have done on many occasions," observed Mrs. La Monte earnestly. "You comlliment me, indeed. But I presume you have heard the story of the master and his jewel?" "Not that I can remember. Relate it," answered Mrs. La Monte. "There was once a man who passed his time in fishing. He would leave his home early in the morning, equipped with fish-hook, line, and tackle, select some retired spot on the stream, and fish, and feel happiest if he could return home with a large splendid specimen fish. Once he caught one which for size and liveliness never was known to exist in that stream. He triumphantly hastened home, passed through- the most frequented streets, and exhibited the ex- traordinary fish to his friends, whom he at the same time asked to come and partake of it. Many accepted the invitation, for that gentleman had not only the reputa-  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7121-00000052"/> 102     "TIlE FORGIVING KISS;"         ,  tion of being a good hand at catching fish, but also of preparing them for the table in a masterly manner. As the fish was being dressed, a stone as large as a walnut, of the clearest water and of beautiful brilliancy, was found in its stomach. All present admired the jewel, and speculated on the value of that extraordinary gem. 'No money can buy this diamond of me,' exclaimed the master of the jewel. 'I will have a hole bored through it, and wear it as a trophy of my fishing exploits.' His friends did not approve of his having that jewel pierced: it would destroy in part its matchless brilliancy and lower its value. But the lucky possessor would not listen to the reasoning of his friends, and went to the jeweller to have the stone pierced. He called on all the jtwellers of that town; none would un- dertake it. He ordered his horses and carriage, and in post haste drove to the nearest city, visited there the jewellers, but they all declined to pierce the extraordinary jewel. He posted from city to city, visited all the jewellers, but they all declined to pierce the gem. Disheartened, he returned home, and bitterly complained that there was not a jeweller in the state who would pierce his jewel. "Let me have it,' exclaimed his hostler; and in utter de- spair the master of the precious jewel ventured to have the diamond pierced by his servant." "And did he pierce it?" asked Mrs. La Monte with great interest. "Yes, he did, and made of the most precious and costly jewel that ever existed a cracked and disfigured stone of  little or no value. So it is with religion and the expound- ers of religion. Religion is the most precious jewel that ex- ists; but it requires those who are pure in thought and well versed in the accumulated wisdom of mankind to ex- pound it; alas! we have now many who preach and expound. religion, who are neither pure in thought nor well versed i,   OR, OUR DESTINY.        103 in the accumulated wisdom of mankind. They know as little of practising and preaching religion as that hostler did of piercing that precious stone, so miraculously found in the belly of the fish. Compare me with those jewellers who de- clined to pierce that precious jewel for fear of injuring it and lessen therewith its great value." "Yes, you are right; it is irksome to listen to a sermon which is void of compact wisdom and eloquent delivery. Our minister is a splendid-looking man: he is always as neat as a pin; but when he commences to preach a ser- mon, he looks like a school-boy who does not know his les- son, and he behaves more like a wood-chopper than a priest," said Mrs. La Monte smilingly. "Perhaps he has missed his calling, and the poor man is not to be blamed," observed Rosalind charitably. "Missed his calling: that is one of the great evils of hu- inanity. A man who has a natural inclination to be a farm- er, and would succeed splendidly in farming, chooses to be a lawyer, and makes such a poor lawyer that he has not tal- ent enough to support himself honorably, much less to support a wife and children. Another has natural talent for a good mechanic, chooses the ministry as his profession, and makes such a mess of it that even the uneducated Indians wonder that any denomination could send such a man out in the wide world as a missionary. And so we could continue to trace misfortune to 'missed his calling,'" said Mrs. Wehlen thoughtfully. Mrs. La Monte did not listen to the remarks of Mrs. Wehlen, but was absorbed in admiring her daughter, who had com- pleted her toilet, and exclaimed joyfully, "Rosalind, you look truly beautiful, perfectly magnificent; grand-grand enough to mount a throne; that azure blue, trimmed with white point, and those brilliant jewels, set off to such good advan- tage your alabaster-like complexion, with its rosy tint. Come,  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7121-00000053"/> 1r04o     THE FORGIVING KISS ;"  darling, let me kiss you, and let me hope that this day you will become the affianced of Count Carl Von Mardeck. Give up the thoughlts of ever marrying Charles Hunting. You were not born to be a shop-keeper's wife. A countess or a princess is your true destiny." Rosalind buried her face in her hands, and sadly exclaimed,  "Mother, your remarks are painful to me. I cannot receive your expected visitors in this costume: it is. too fantastic; it will answer to appear in the ball-room, or an evening devot- ed to gayety, but not to receive afternoon callers; it displays poor taste and poor judgment, to which I cannot consent." And with great rapidity she disrobed herself, and threw aside the costly dress and rich head-ornaments. Mrs. La Monte looked bewildered at the remarks and actions of Rosalind, and bitterly complained of having a daughter who would not try to appear before noble visi- tors in her best apparel. "What a misfortlue to be the mother  of such a child!" A knock at the door stopped the torrent  of lamenting words that Mrs. La Monte had ready on her lips. "Come in." The maid entered, and brought a letter, saying, "A lady of genteel appearance called, and requested me to hand you personally this letter." Mrs. La Monte took the letter, glanced at the seal, and nervously exclaimed, "lWhat! a letter to me bearing the seal of his Grace the Archbishop. Where did you leave the lady that brought this letter?" "In the ante-room," answered the maid. "Quick! show her into the reception-room, and offer her the best chair. I will pay her my respects in a few mo- ments." Opening the envelope and reading the letter, which con- tained only a few lines, she exclaimed, ("Even his Grace takes 1   OR, OUR DESTINY.        105 an interest in my welfare : I am no longer alone; " and on tip- toe she left the room, to receive the strange visitor. "What does this mean that the Archbishop should write a letter to my mother, and send it with a special messenger " asked Rosalind thoughtfully. "It means money. You are of course aware that your mother is a born Catholic, but her parents did not attend at church because it would have cost some money, and old Mr. Bottwell avoided everything that required an expenditure of cash ; and, after her marriage, she readily joined the church of your father; but now, since it became publicly known that your mother is in her own right the heiress of a million dollars of 5-20 bonds, the clergy have undoubtedly resolved to save her. It is too valuable a soul to perish,without being saved, and at the same time doing something for the church: that church which has for its mission to save mankind, at the cost of enlightenment and liberty, in order to make men more flexible, and readier to be ruled and ruined by the clergy. I despise them. They are mean plotters. When I was a poor woman, who scrubbed and washed for a living, and was shivering with cold and hunger, not a priest was to be seen who would have called, spoken to me words of sympathy, and tried to alleviate my sufferings; but now, since they have learned that I have saved some property, and have a .son who is reported a millionnaire, I have received the most distin- guished consideration at their hands. Still, I pay no attention to their sly overtures. I avoid them now; as they avoided me when I was- poor and needy. Well would it be for your mother, and for the whole family, if she would do the same." "And can I in any way guard my mother against their machinations?" "You can, by not making your mother angry and dis- please her.

Be on the alert." "I will; but, good Mrs. Wehlen, can you not prolong your stay and assist me to conquer the difficulties that seem to beset our family?" asked Rosalind affectionately. "No, my dear, I cannot. It is best that I should leave;  i but you know lly place of abode, and my doors will always be open, and lmy arms ready to receive you; for my heart anld mly whole being are at your service, glad and happy at -the opportunity to save and to promote your welfare," ex- claimed Mrs. Wehlen feelingly. "I amn happy in your friendship. I shall miss you ; our house will look deserted without you. If we must part, then bless me before you go." And with these words the beauti- ful Rosalind bowed her head before her aged and devoted friend, who gently laid her hand on her head, and with uplifted eyes said, in a supplicating tone:  I invoke our Heavenly Father, the Cause of all causes, the supreme Architect and Ruler of all that exists in heaven and on earth, to bless you with His choicest blessings-good health, peace, a quick and clear comprehension, the power to withstand temptation, and abundance of patience, and a long life to enjoy the benefits of those blessings. God, thou ever watchful Protector of all, grant my supplication, for my soul prays for it-that soul'which I verily believe is a part and parcel of Thee, the great Spirit who gives life to everything; who has appointed man to be the lord over  earthly creations, through whom Thou beautifiest the earth,  and elevatest the faithful to heavenly perfection." The  friends embraced, wept silently, and their lips moved as in prayer. They kissed affectionately and parted--one to her house on licturesque Rox Street, with her Bible as her com- panion, while the other remained at her parental mansion, with its grand prospects of hope, disappointments, and hope agail-i-the world.  J   OR, OUR DESTINY.         107 CHAPTER V. Wild courage may the moon display; A Christian's boast is to obey; For where the Lord of earth and skies Walked in a servant's humble guise, The fathers of our order there The vow of holy knighthood sware, The hardest duty to fulfil, To curb our own rebellious will!

'  LEASE step this way, madam; be seated: my lady will see you in a few moments," said the maid to the BUS!- lady of genteel appearance, who followed and ac- cepted the proffered chair. Being left alone, she looked around, and minutely examined the room and furniture, and in a low tone said, "What sort of a Catholic lady is this, who has not in her reception-room a picture that indicates her reli--' gion? How beautiful an engraving of the Virgin Mary, with her blessed son in her arims, would look! or the painting of Jesus on the cross, showing plainly the nails and the blood- drops as they spouted forth! Such a picture is truly inspiring- it is edifying, and no true Catholic is without a crucifix. But what do I see?" and at those words the lady of genteel appear-  ance quickly crossed herself and repeated, "What do I see? the picture of Moses, with his long white beard, and the tablets of the ten commandments in his hand, embroidered on canvas in an exquisite manner, and bearing the inscription, also marked with a needle,-' MosEs, the great captain and  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7121-00000055"/> I03     "TTHE FORGIVING KISS;  lawgiver, whom I honor.-Rosalintd a MAont.' Undoubt- cdly the work of one of the daughters of the house. A girl who will embroider such a picture on canvas is spiritually lost. What a great field America presents to be saved from  utter destruction! how fortunate for our holy cause and  mankind that his Holiness [crossing herself], the infallible Pope [again crossing herself], has decreed that this country  is to be reinforced with his true disciples, ivho will work and toil, that those who are born Catholics shall, remain so, and those who are not should become good Catholics, and obey the church in everything; and the church does not approve of a picture of Moses being seen in their houses.' She  paused, reflected, and continued: "Why should the church object to a picture of Moses? If there had not been a Moses, would there have been a Jesus?"She started at these words, and quickly crossed herself, exclaiming, "What evil thoughts, what naughty words to be uttered by me, a devout Catholic! What would Father Ignatius say and do if he had heard  them. Put in spite of myself I will think, I will rea- son, when left to myself. I am restless; there is a good deal  of sin in me, if to reflect and reason can be called a sin; but my church comimands belief and obedience; and believe and obey I will, for the church is my master. Through the church I hope to be made happy, and to be  saved." Mrs. La Monte slowly opened the door, and overheard the exclamation, "'The church is my master; through the church I hope to be made happy, and to be saved." She  good-naturedly observed, "I am glad, madam, to hear that your thoughts are Iusy with the great thlee, ' to be saved.'  The lady of genteel appearance lowered her head, and meekly said : "Please do not call me madam : call me Sister Hulda. I am made happy by h earing you call to be saved' the great  :   OR, OUR DESTINY.        109 theme, for it is indeed a theme of the greatest importance that concerns man." "And why call you Sister Hulda?" "I have been called so many, many years m my native land, and would never have come to America were it not for the cruel mandate issued by the heartless Prince Bis- marck-" "Perhaps it is best it should be so. The Israelites have been dispersed, and instead of having Palestine as their home, the whole world is now their country. They seem to be at home, and prosper everywhere," said Mrs. La Monte. "Madam, I am surprised," cried Sister Hulda, crossing herself, " that you, a Catholic lady, should look upon these events so lightly, when the faithful of the church are driven out of their country, and even compare them to the wander- ing Jews." "The wandering Jews?" repeated Mrs. La Monte. "Per- mit me to correct you; the Jews are not a wandering class. The young emigrate from their birth-place to have a broader field for their enterprising spirit; and wherever they find the climate congenial to their health, and the community of an enterprising nature, they make there their home, and add through their enterprise to the prosperity of the country, of which they become a part. It is a mistaken impression to call the Israelites wandering Jews; they are citizens of the world, whom we must in justice respect, regardless of all that has been written and said against them." Sister Hulda listened attentively, but made no answer; her lips moved in prayer, and she crossed herself several ti:les, which Mrs. La Monte observed. "You seem to pray," said she in astonishment. "I have been praying, praying that the Lord Jesus may forgive you the sin of taking the part of the Jews who have crucified Him."  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7121-00000056"/> "This is also a wrong impression, for it is a historical fact, which every candid mind must admit, that it was the Roinan soldiers who crucified Jesus, and not the Jews; and crucifixion was the mode of execution in, that age, as hang- ing on the gallows is now-in vogue for murderers, and even patriots," said Mrs. La Monte earnestly. "And can you point out to me the volume, the chapter, and the pages, in which it is proven that it was the Roman soldiers who crucified our Lord, and not the Jews ? " asked Sister Hulda, with flushed cheeks. "I cannot; but my daughter Rosalind will: she is a great historical reader." "The same young lady that has worked in zephyr-wool that picture of Moses on canvas ? " asked Sister Hulda, bow- ing her head as if in sorrow. "Yes, Rosalind is a great admirer of Moses, for he has been an extraordinarily great man; he has vastly benefited mankind." "Indeed ! indeed !" again exclaimed Sister Hulda.  I fear that mother and daughter have been reading the wrong books; The Lord be blessed that he has directed me here " and she withdrew from her bosom an ivory crucifix, kissed the emblem tenderly, and pressed it toward Mrs. La Monte, exclaiming with intense energy, "Kiss it! kiss it! and on your knees pray, for it is your Saviour; without His media- tion you cannot be saved, and your soul is everlastingly damned." " Your conclusions are harsh. They may influence the ig- norant, but not tle enlightened mind. I need not kiss the cross, or kneel before the emblem of the Lord Jesus, and still be a good Catholic, a good Christian, who inwardly believes He is the Mediator, the Saviour of mankind, to whom I can pray, and worship devoutly in silence, and without ostenta- tion; and even if I should experience moments of doubt,   that He is the Son of God, that He is the great Mediator be- tween God and man, and that He is not the Saviour of man- kind, that man can be and is saved through God's direct grace, I cannot believe that the Lord Jesus will, on account of my doubt, condemn my soul everlastingly. If He would, He is too selfish, too revengeful, unworthy of His exalted position to be the Mediator between God and man. I claim the high-' est privilege that man possesses-' to reason."' "To out-reason reason," interrupted Sister Hulda; to be- conic an idolator, to run after false gods. Believe in the Lord Jesus and you are saved. You are moored to the 'Rock of Ages;' doubt Him as the Mediator, the Saviour of mankind, and you float on turbulent seas, without a compass, liable to swal- luwyou up and dash your crushed body and soul into everlast- ing wrath. It is blasphemy to doubt Jesus as the Son of God, the Saviour of mankind; to believe in Him, and believe in Him firmly, is sublime wisdom, which is rewarded with peace on earth and everlasting happiness in heaven. Kiss His image. Kneel before Him in humility. Be quick, ere it is too late. You hesitate? You shake your head? You are on the brink of destruction. I will not condemn you, but pray for you. Permit me to be near you in any place you  choose, as your slave, as your sister, as your religious teacher, as your guardian angel, who, of her own free will, will make every sacrifice to save you as the faithful child of the church, as the pure lamb of Jesus, who trusts in Him as her shepherd, her star, her guide to heaven, before the throne of grace." "You are recommended to me by his Grace the Arch- bishop as a worthy person. You may stay in my house as my aid and companion, and share with me the joys and sorrows of the family." Wilh these words, Mrs. La Monte pulled the bell. The maid quickly appeared, and received her lady's command: "S Show this lady, Sister Hulda, to the  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7121-00000057"/> "2     " /  U -HE R FOl' G' VI-NG ZKISS;"I room just vacated, as I see, by Mrs. Wehlen; and you will please obey Sister Hil da with the same readiness you obeyed the orders of Mrs. Wehlen." Sister Hulda made a respectful bow, and followed her guide. Reaching the apartment, and being left to herself, she  knocked on the walls, saying "These walls are only partition walls. I must be careful not to speak too loud when I speak to myself.  This room looks comfortable; but strange! what do I see? an engraving of King Solomon sit- ting on the throne to judge between the two women, both claiming the living child as being their own. What a taste, to have such a picture on the walls, instead of the picture of St. Paul, St. Peter, St. Stephen, St. Luke, St. Matthew, St. John, St. James, St. Mark, St. Thomas, St. Joseph, St. Fran- cois Xavier, or some other saint! Any of them would be more inspiring than a picture of Solomon. I iill have this picture removed, and replaced by the saints." At these words, Sister Hulda paused and looked thoughtfully upon a ring on her left middle finger, in the shape of a serpent, bearing the engraving R. O. R., signifying "f Rule Or Ruin. "Rule or ruin I will in this house!" exclaimed she; and continued: "My resolve is firm to become one of the foremost members of our holy order, and when I reach that eminence which I hope to attain, my revenge on his Grace the Archbishop shall be  overwhelming and complete, for he has treated me with a  haughty discourtesy, which is unbearable, and which must  be revenged. For notwithstanding my credentials and rec-  j ommendations from abroad, he has not granted me even an  audience and an interview. Were it not for the clever stroke  of policy pursued by Father Ignatius, of furnishing me with that letter to Madamne La Monte in the name of the Arch- bishop, I should never have obtained a footing here, where I can do most good; for a million of dollars is a large sum, and I must and will obtain it all for our holy order, our holy '4   OR, OUR DESTINY.        I13 church." With these words, Sister Hulda drew the ivory cru- cifix from her bosom, intensely clasped it, and with uplifted eyes prayed, "Jesus! my Saviour! be with me in this holy task." Hardly had she uttered this invocation, when the cross fell from her hand, and she exclaimed in an alarmed tone, "What does this mean? the cross burns my hands as if it were burning coals! Is it an omen? Is it a warning that I should desist from ' ruling or ruining' this family? Is it possi- ble that Jesus, the Son of God, the Saviour of mankind, should not be in favor of the church obtaining all the wealth it can gather, and use that wealth to extend its power-that church which rescues mankind from the folly of thinking and acting of their own will and pleasure, instead of under the guidance of the priests-those anointed servants? No! no! Jesus my Saviour cannot approve of so much wealth remaining in hands like the La Montes; who waste it away in extravagance, in gauds demoralizing to the young and the loor. Far better for the La Montes, that it should pass into the coffers of our order. We can place it to a better use." The door opened suddenly, and Miss Rosalind stepped into the room. She started on seeing Sister Hulda, and asked, in a tone of surprise, "May I ask your name? By whose authority are you in this lallowed room?" "I am called Sister Hulda. Lady La Monte has, upon the recommendation of his Grace the Archbishop, bestowed on me the great honor of being her aid and companion, and had me escorted by the maid to this room as my own," answered Sister Hulda, bowing rcspectfully, but not sub- missively, before the young lady of the house. "I was not aware that his Grace the Archbishop com- bined with his exalted position an intelligence-office," re- marked Rosalind, sarcastically. "His Grace is like our Master-humble and ready to do good," observed Sister Hulda.  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7121-00000058"/> "4     ' TIlE FORGIVING KISS;  "Well would it have been for mankind if the prelates had been as their Master, humble and ready to do good, with- out a selfish purpose. But, alas! the past and the present teach that the priests are arrogant and selfish. Their motives are invariably setf-agtgrandizement, at the sacrifice of peace, harmony, and good-will between men and men.  Their arrogance, their selfishness, their grasping motives have caused more misery to the family of man than all the storms that have ever' passed over land and sea, than all the sickness in its thousand forms that has ever visited the human family. To divide, and then to rule, has been their tactics from time immemnorial. Thanks to the able and courageous authors who have vigorously torn away the mask of the priesthood, and shown them before the public as they have been-as they still try to be. Thanks for their silvery blast, which rings pleasantly in the ear of every, intelligent human being. Beware of priestcraf, if you value your' liberty and peace. Thanks to our Heavenly Father that the day is dawning when the power of the priests for mischief will forever vanish," said Rosalind, with a poetical earn- estness bordering on sublimity. Even Sister Hulda could not help admiring the noble maiden, although every word she uttered was like a thorn in her side. She hardly knew what to say, and hesitatingly stammered, "Let me, oh let me pray for you!" crossing herself quickly. "' Let me pray for you," she repeated, " for you are a sinner." "Stop! you need not pray for me. I can pray for my- self. You have no right to call me a sinner, as long as my motives are pure ; as long as my heart pleads unselfishy and lovingly for mankind, without any distinction, which I feel and know it does. Can you conscientiously say as much?" asked Rosalind, earnestly. Sister Hulda, although a master in the art of masking the   OR, OUR DESTINY.         5 feelings, could not at that moment repress them and appear placid. Her cheeks became flusled, and her usual cool, calculating eyes flashed strangely under the searching glance of her intelligent questioner. Composing herself, she ex- claimed, "You need praying for. You are a sinner-a great sinner; because you denounce Christ, the Shepherd who takes care of His flock; who for eighteen centuries has soothed the griefs of mankind and led them triumphantly out of barbarism and fanaticism to the present state of civil- ization. Your assertion that your motives are pure, that your heart beats unselfishy and lovingly for mankind, with- out any distinction, is a delusion. It embraces too much to be of any service to any part. ' To do good' you must unite yourself with the church, and uphold its arms to convert all to believe in the Lord Jesus as the Redeemer, the Pop6e as His infallible vicar on earth, and the clergy as the represent- atives of both, whose wisdom is supreme and is to be re- sDected accordingly." Rosalind listened attentively, and thoughtfully answered: "I excuse you for persistence in calling me a sinner, for your remarks have convinced me that you are not a caln reasoner, but a fanatical one, who without reflection assumes the right to condemn every one who differs with you in your views. I judge that you are with, or perhaps without, selfish motives, infatuated with the idea that the Pope is the in- fallible vicar of God on earth, that his clergy possess all wis- dom, and that nothing good can be accomplished except through the church, while history teaches the reverse. Every- thing has truly advanced; civilization has been developed outside of the pale of the church. That country in which the clergy rules is centuries behind in civilization and pros- perity. Look at Spain, once the foremost power on earth. She has, under the rule of the clergy, dwindled down to a fifth- rate power, whose inhabitants have become narrow-minded  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7121-00000059"/> I 6     "THE FORGIVING 7KISS;"      : and fickle; and who, as they look to the priest for advice, will still further decline. For the priests are, with a very few exceptions, no patriots ; their allegiance is given to the Pope, and as the Pope is a creature of the Jesuits, he orders the priests to act as the Jesuits direct, and the Jesuits know no country save their order; and to advance the interests of their order, there is no dark deed which they would-: hesi- tate to execute. Everything must bend to their will; what- ever is in their way must perish; and often, as a consequence, the prosperity of a nation has vanished and its downfall has followed. For me to unite myself with such a church would be an unpatriotic act; would be to countenance dis- union, in bringing on strife between man and man; to favor limited instead of liberal education among the masses. I am too religious to give whatever influence I possess to such a course." "Do you mean to say that the Catholics are an unpatriotic people? disorganizers and abettors of ignorance?" asked Sister Hulda, in an angry tone. ' I have nothing to say against the Catholics as a people; they are patriotic, brave, orderly, zealous for the welfare of their families; but I consider their priests, if not as a whole, yet in the majority, as mischievous, as detrimental to the prosperity and true greatness of their flock.. They aim to keep them in darkness, and 'rule them for their selfish ends, which causes many to live in hovels and pass their time in saloons, where they endeavor to drown their miseries." "It is a slander; for it cannot be demonstrated by facts," exclaimed Sister Hulda in anger. Mrs. La Monte stepped hastily into the room, with a tel- escope in her hand, saying, "Rosalind, I have been on the observatory, and through my telescope could,see a carriage, drawn by two fast horses, accompanied by two horsemnen, coming in this direction.   OR, OUR DESTINY.        117 The carriage, no doubt, contains the Count Carl Von Mar- deck and his sister, and the horseback riders appear from the distance to be Augustus and Charles Hunting. You had better prepare your toilette to receive them." Rosalind blushed deeply, and a happy light shone firom her beautiful brilliant eyes, which Sister Hulda, with her lynx look, quickly observed, and murmured, as mother and daughter left the room, "That young lady is in love. Let me first find out with, whom, and I will throw every obstacle in her way. Girl, you know too much. I must humble you, and, half-crazed, bring'you knocking at the cloister, begging for admittance to pass the rest of thy days, and thy property shall pass into the strong box of the order which you so thoroughly despise. Ha, ha, ha!" she laughed. "You are able, but I have, no doubt of the result. I will bring you to terms, you slanderer of the church!" "No, ma. I object to appearing excessively dressed. I  feel more at ease in my usual apparel. I. dislike to be over- dressed. It exhibits not only a vanity but a positive weak- ness, which in the eyes of the truly worthy detracts more than adds to gracefulness. What I like to adorn is lmy soul with pure thoughts, with noble deeds; these are ornaments which appear beautiful before God and in the sight of man. Let me be plainl, but good," remarked Rosalind, in a tone as if speaking to herself. Mrs. La MXonte clasped her hands and exclaimed com- plainingly, "XWhat an unfortunate mother I am, to have a daughter who has such a graceful form and so many rich and costly dresses, aid 'will- not wear them, even when an unmarried Count honors us with an afternoon call.

Listen to my advice, or you will live and die an old maid." "Anl adorned body without an adorned soul resembles a rose without fragrance," replied Rosalind. They reached the reception-room. Mrs. La Monte pulled the bell three times in succession, a sign for Jim the coachman and house-servant, who promptly responded to the call with an obedient bow. "Jim, quick, change your working clothes for your full livery, including your white vest with the silver buttons, for I am expecting grand com- pany, and the master is judged by the appearance of his ser- vants. Be on hand when they come, and be attentive." Jim bowed again, and left the room soliloquizing, 't Expecting grand company! Perhaps some Count whom Mr. La Monte will again escort to the gate with a loaded revolver; but this time there is no good Mrs. Wehlen in the house-to apprise Mr. La Monte of strange doings that require such an ex- pulsion.

While Mrs. La Monte gave her directions to Jim, Rosa- lind opened the piano and sang and played the following beautiful morning hymn; SING TO THE LORD. [A MORNING HYMN.]  1.

The mother listened attentively to the song and the music, and was highly pleased7 for in Rosalind's ,inging and play- ing her poetical soul took an earnest part. "Beautiful! magnificent!" exclaimed Mrs. La Monte. "Where did you select that beautiful hymn?" "From Dr. Isaac M. Wise's Hymn-book, and the music has been composed by Professor Carl Barus. Do you like it, ma?" "Yes, I do; but why do you sing a hymn written by a Jewish rabbi? Why do you not select something that his Grace the Archbishop has written'?" "I am not aware that his Grace the Archbishop has written any hymns; if he has, they were not printed, and therefore beyond my reach; but I doubt that his Grace or any other of his compeers composed anything. They have, no doubt, the ability, but the talents and time of so many bishops are occupied with self-aggrandizement; efforts to obtain wealth, position, and political power; to dictate to others who are to obey and bow to their ilnmerial will, under the cloak of religion. A rabbi has no such ambition ; his aims are to educate his flock, and lead them to recognize God as the living Source of all that exists, as the Being and Father who graciously gives us ample opportunity to live happily on earth and prepare ourselves for a higher and an eternal life.

"Daughter, you enumerate these Jewish doctrines with an emphasis as if you believed in them." "They please me well, I must confess," replied Rosalind, promptly.  "Let me sing to you another hymn, from the same book, by the same author." And before the mother could make a reply, the young lady sang with her silvery voice, accompanied by the piano, a hymn by the"same au- thor and composer: 4 From Sinai's height a fountain springeth, And far away its waters flow: A stream that blessing ever bringeth, The purest, sweetest, here below. Whoe'er its limpid water drinks, Delights to strengthen inner links.

While Rosalind played and sang, Mrs. La Monte opened the door which led to the passage, and was not surprised to see Grandfather Hunting, Augustus Hunting, his beautiful wife, and her brother, the Count Carl Von Mardeck. The grandfather motioned to Mrs. La Monte to be silent, and not disturb the beautiful songstress: an intimation Mrs. La Monte readily obeyed, being delighted to give Rosalind the opportunity of being heard by her distinguished visitors. As soon as Rosalind finished, she was the recipient of a hearty bravo, and clapping of hands by the whole company. Ros- alind received with a natural grace, the visitors whom Grand- father Hunting introduced. Count Carl Von Mardeck com-  plimented the young lady very sincerely upon her beautiful singing and playing, and remarked: "When I read of Amer- ica, it made the impression on my mind that the whole pop- ulation-men, women, and children-were all occupied with hewing the forest, or draining the swampy ground, and that, consequently, the higher arts of education were totally neg- lected. I feel happy, indeed, tp find myself mistaken, for music and song are as highly appreciated and cultivated here, as they are in my dear fatherland. I am, like all Ger- mans, fond of music; and now may I request you to play and sing another piece?" This was said in such a pleasant, pleading tone, that the request was promptly complied with,   OR, OUR DESTINY.         127 and the young lady, turning a leaf in her note-book, com- menced to play and sing : "Hark! What sounds from heaven's lyre So grand, so powerful, so sublime! God reveals His will in words of fire, Eternal truth, unchal ged by time. "Hark! What sounds from Horeb's height O'er thunder peals the word of truth! God expounds His will in words of light, Reclaims His sons to sacred truth. "Hark! It sounds with strength and might: Our God is true, His words divine. God is wisdom, truth, and light; All glory, Lord of Hosts, is Thine." When she concluded, the whole company applauded warmly. Count Carl Von Mardeck exclaimed, "This is di- vine! this is divine! Who composed this? Is it by Men- delssohn? , I know all his productions by heart; his music leads us to the very portals of heaven. This piece, which you played and sang so inspiringly, seems as if composed by that same immortal author." "I am glad you admire it. The poem was written by our home talent, the Rev. Dr. Isaac M. Wise, and the music was composed by Professor Carl Barus.. I admire and cherish the old masters, but I revere our own geniuses, who have the courage to publish their productions at the risk of being ridiculed by some thoughtless critic who, perchance, occupies that elevated position to form public opinion. I like to encourage home talent; it helps to bring forth what we have among us, what is really worth possessing, viz., thought-thought that quickens elevating thoughts in others," observed Rosalind. The Count was pleased with the remarks of the young  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7121-00000065"/> 128     "TI IR FORGIV[ING K'ISS;" lady, and said, "To quicken elevating thoughts is the aim and substance of all education, and that method which pro- motes it the most quickly is sure of being universally adopted. Thus far, the methods have been greatly at fault, and therefore the results are defective. Religion is certainly one of the methods which is intended by our Creator to awaken in us elevating thoughts, and therefore religious in- clination is a part of our very nature; b'ut the religion,as- preached and practiced in the past and present,has been, and still is, too egotistical, and, as a consequence, it has failed in accomplishing as much good as it should; its ego- tism has often been so fiery, that it has caused hate, instead of love, disunion instead of union, among men, and were it not for music, which is now practiced by all denomina- tions in their religious services, religious instructions would lose their hold on the community, for the prevailing and ad- vancing intelligence in society' makes men weary of the dissension and hate that is thundered from many pulpits by preachers who may have talent to tend a flock of sheep, but not to preside over the house of worship, as a place where words of true wisdom should be uttered in a manner that ele- vates a whole congregation. In what -the preacher fails, music sutDlies. Music, well played and sung, is the language of the heart. It knows no egotism ; it knows no prejudice; it whispers a thousand thanks to God and man; and grati- tude is the foundation of love. Love is godlike ; it creatgs, it preserves, it is forbearing, it forgives, it makes hopefufl- all this music quickens into life. Thanks to God for the musical ear he has implanted in our nature, and thanks to those who have promoted it, for it brings us nearer to the Great Spirit, the Builder of the universe, and the Preservcr of all that is and ever will be." "Count, you have expressed my sentiments!" exclaimed Grandfather Hunting. "Mvsic is the fount of grace that   OR, OUR DESTINY.        129 God has placed in our possession. It is a common inherit- ance, and it is well to lean on, in our hours of joy or sor- row. The whole week I longed for the Sabbath, tlat pearl of days, when I can go into the house of worship-not to hear the sermon of the minister, for I have outlived his theory that one must be a Methodist, or he cannot be a good Christian, and hope to be saved. No! Such reasoning is distasteful to me. What I enjoy is the music of the or- gan and the song of the choir. It assists me to pour out my gratitude to my Maker, and I feel as if His spirit of grace were resting on me, inspiring me with new strength and love. Oh, there is nothing like music! sacred music![ when one gets as old as I am. Count, please play some of Mendelssohn's compositions. His music is not too lively, and therefore suits my ear." Rosalind left the seat before the piano, which she grace- fully offered to the Count, who, returning the courtesy, ac- cepted the chair. Adjusting the same to the proper height, he took his seat and commenced to play Mendelssohn's St. Paul in a manner that seemed to carry his listeners heavenward; and when he reached that part, "O Lord have mercy," the whole company, including even Mrs. La Monte, the born Bottwell, by one accord joined in the chorus, "O Lord have mercy." Grandfather Hunting was the happiest of all; but when the Count finished playing, he exclaimed, "This has been a musical treat, long to be remembered. Play another piece; please do!" begged the noble old man. "I will, but not sacred music;" and the Count com- menced to play from that charming opera, "Martha," in such a style that one could understand the very words of the opera. He seemed to direct his whole power on that part where Nancy sings, 'Ikch kann nehle, Ic/h /ann stricken, ich kanin flicken lind kleideor maccen," etc., etc. In the midst of it he stopped and exclaimed: 6*  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7121-00000066"/> "Variation is the order of the day. Let me imitate on, this instrument the sounds of the animals;" and forthwith he produced the roaring of a lion, the hissing of an angry cat, the barking of a dog, the melodious song of the night- ingale, which astonished his listeners. Rosalind looked be- wildered; her admiration for the wonderful playing was boundless, and unconsciously she looked upon the talented young Count with admiring eyes. He appeared to her not only beautiful in person, but poetical in nature and senti- ment. She leaned forward and complimented the Count upon his marvellous playing, saying, "Never would I have thought it possible to bring forth on the piano such variations of tone, and were I not a wit- ness of its performance, would never have believed it. It is almost miraculous." "Your praise makes me happy," responded the Count, with a graceful bow. "My brother was fortunate enough to have a piano on board his vessel, and on his long cruise he whiled away the hours by practicing, and thus became a player of extraordin- ary brilliancy. There is nothing like practicing. Practice makes the master," remarked Mrs. Augustus Hunting. "Sister Augustine is also enthusiastic about my playing. I am thrice happy." "Yes, Carl, you deserve to be complimented; and well would it be if other commanders of vessels would imitate you, and have a piano or an organ on their ship, and practice music. It would not only be a source of pleasure to then, but also to their subordinates. It would improve the taste ; of the sailors. How much good could be acomplished if all would try to elevate their fellow-men in the scale of knowl- edge, in the proper mode of life-" Augustine was interrupted in her remarks by Grandfather Hunting, who, having noticed a book on the table, with the   1,V .N UJ -3"V. V.'     13 title ' Atonement," commenced to read it, and was so well pleased that he exclaimed, "Permit me to read to you a few passages of the divine service of American Israelites for the Day of Atonement, by Dr. Wise: it is a literary treas- ure." All signified their willingness to listen, and the old patriarch read: "' O Lord God of the spirits of all flesh. Thou who kill- est and revivest, lowerest down to the silent grave and call- est forth Thine image from the night of death to cernal light. Thou hast appointed this day of atonement for Is- rael to sanctify our lives on earth, to prepare for death and life eternal. Thou hast hallowed this day to be a Sabbath of the mind, that the repenting soul be redeemed of the op- pressive burden of guilt, freed of the earthly fetters, and soar aloft to the illuminated height of eternal truth. And in con- templation of Thy boundless grace, anticipate the bliss which Thou, in the realm of eternity, bestowest on the pure and sanctified soul. O give angel's pinions to the panting soul, to rise above the mutable, brief, and dolorous life in this frame of clay, and behold the rays from the luminous palace of eternity, where the sun of Thy grace radiates eter- nal felicity on Thy returning children. Man is feeble and perishable. His devices and efforts are vain. Like a sha- dow passes the son of man, and no trace is left of his foot- prints. Scarcely born, he walks on his sepulchre ; over pain and disappointmenl, he hastens into the night of the grave. Thousands wet their scanty morsel of bread with their tears, and in the sweat of their brows struggle painfully through a grievous life, till finally their fondest hopes expire in death. Like fiery coal, the passions burn in the human breast, and beguile to enjoyment and wickedness. But the delight ex- pires in enjoyment, and remorse follows wickedness. Sin consrunes the marrow of life. The heart shrinks in enjoy- ment. Combat and victory, or remorse and pain, mark the'  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7121-00000067"/> 132     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" hours of our earthly pilgrimage. All his lifetime man wars against the elements, against man; within himself, the struggle never ceases; he prevails or fails, only to resume the combat the next moment. From his cradle to the grave man struggles. "' What is man, the son of dust? What is man, O Lord? ' The eye is never satisfied of seeing; endless are the wishes of the heart. No mortal has yet had enough of wealth, power, respect, honor, knowledge, or wisdom, when death coses his career. The son of man devises new schemes on the fresh graves of a thousand disappointed hopes. When Moses had acomplished the work of redemp- tion and revelation, the greatest ever done by man, he stood dissatisfied on the summit of Mount Nebo, and beheld the promised land, which to reach, God in His wisdom had refused him. Discontentment abides in palaces as in the beg. gars' huts, and an insatiable heart heaves in the breast richly decorated. More, still more; man desires, in the midst of the brightest opulence. Finally death closes all. The combat and the struggle, grief and joy, pain and delight. The broken eye is satisfied of seeing. The benumbed heart has enough of earthly possessions. The lord and his servant, the rich and the poor, the mighty and the feeble, the wise and the simple-death equalizes them all; the earth covers the re- mains of a king like those of a beggar. "' What is man, the son of dust? What is man, O Lord? ' 'However gladly we wouild forget all this, we cannot. We are reminded thereof at every step on the path of life. Every suffering, each pain of the morbid body, -reminds us of mortality. The sepulchres tell the tale of corruption,   OR, OUR DESTINY.        133 and the mourner's tears speak of our perishable nature. As the leaves in autumn drop from the tree, we see one man after another go home to eternal repose. T'Ihere, a father, a mother, returns to the womb of the earth; with aching hearts orphan children follow the coffin; and often they return from the parent's grave to a life of sorrow and desti- tution. There, pain-stricken parents with tearless eyes fol- low the coffin of their child, their fondest hope, their sweetest joy, and return disconsolately and inconsolably to their cheerless home. The widow who with hot tears wets the grave of the friend of her youth, and laments his untimely death, looks sadly and woe-stricken on the cold sepulchre; the father who, in the cheerless circle of his motherless children, bewails his lost joys, silently mourns over the loss of the partner of his heart. All of them, and many more, remind us of our frail and perishable nature. That we are like the fleeting shadow that passes tracelessly-a dream, whose phantoms vanish like the dust which the wind dis- perses. The heart is feeble; it trembles; it quakes at the memorial of destruction. The soul shudders at the horrors of corruption; it revolts against the claims of annihilation. What is man, the son of dust.? What is man, O Lord? "'O Lord, my God, Thou hast created this universe. Thou preservest and governest it in Thy wisdom. Every- thing therein is so reasonable, so wisely placed, so harmon- iously excellent, and Thy goodness reigns over all things. No creature, no mote of this immense creation, is subject to annihilation, or misses its proper aim. Thou bestowest a thousand joys on the irrational creature, and showest end- less delight on fields and groves. Man alone, Thine image, cannot be destined to suffer and struggle, to disappointment and pain, for death and corruption; MAN only, whom Thou 5  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7121-00000068"/> 134     ' THE FORGIVING KISS;" hast gifted with reason and free will, to whom in Thy pater- nal goodness Thou hast revealed Thyself, cannot be born to an aimless existence. Thou art supreme goodness, O Lord. Thou hast not gifted us with this mighty yearning after Thy light; this indomitable panting after the infinite; this rest- less longing after unattainable and indefinable ideas; this eternal dissatisfaction with the world, its treasures and charms, to disappoint us at last, and deliver us to the worms of the dust, after a life of struggle, anxiety, and pain. Thou hast inscribed our soul with the flaming characters of im- mortality. Thou deceivest not. Thou art the God of truth. Supreme justice art Thou, O Lord. There must be a reward to virtue which suffers on earth, and a punishment to wickedness which shouts with gladness on this sublunar world. Those who struggled and prevailed, renounced, over- came, and sacrificed--Thou crownest them with the reful- gent rays of victorious virtue in life everlasting; for Thou rewardest and renderest every creaure its due. Thou art our father; Thou dcstroyest not Thy children. Supreme reason art Thou, O God. Thou sufferest not reason to perish or intellect to be wasted; Thou abandonest not my soul to the grave ; Thou art supreme love ; there can be no death ; it is eternal birth; Thou sufferest not thy holy ones to see cor- ruption. Thou art our rock, O Lord, our confidence, our trust, the life of our life, our light on earth, and our hope in eternity. "Whoml beside Thee have I in heaven? and with Thee I desire none on earth." "' Thy glory, Lortl, surroundeth The souls of saintly mortals, And seraphs' music soundeth From heaven's open portals, To pious pilgrims greeting, At dawn of life's new morning.

They are nigh in the moment of victory and elevation over mortality. The spirit approaches the spirit, the rays of eternal mercy entwine them.

Amen. "' Rise brethren, and in memory of the dear souls who are now present in our minds, praise the only and sole God of Israel as your ancestors did.'" Tears stood in the eyes of Rosalind at many of the beautiful passages of this inspiring prayer. When the grand- father finished, he remarked, "A man who is thus addressed by a minister, lives a solemn hour. When men have as- semnbled in the house of worship, they cannot but be bene- fited; for, to make the first step to become truly good, we must first conquer our excessive vanity and pride, and ac- knowledge to ourselves that we are weak mortals, whom the slightest unfavorable draught prostrates, and is likely to make us helpless creatures; that our strength and our wis- dom are limited ; that we need God's aid and God's inspir- ation to fulfil our destiny fitly." i"What I like in that prayer especially is the silent devo- tion of the child, the husband, the wife, the brotlers, sisters, and friends," observed Mr. Augustus Hunting. "Yes!" exclaimed the grandfather; it carries with it a great moral lesson for the father, mother, husband, wife, brother, sister, and friends, to lead such a pure and noble life as to be worthy to be thus remembered by their children and relatives when they are no more. This undoubtedly has the influence of making every father and mother act their part well as parents; to be not only a father or a mother in name but one in deed. To be such a father and such a mother, it is their most solemn duty to lead an exemplary life, so that their children may grow up with good examples  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7121-00000070"/> 138     "TIE' FORGIVING ICISS; " instilled in their very nature ; to be minidful of their health and of their proper education; that they should be capable of self-denial, self-reliance, and self-help; that they should inherit not only of their parents' wealth, but also useful knowledge, and above all a good name. A father who'is an idler, a libertine, a drunkard, a gambler, a breaker -of the law; or a mother who is careless of the name she bears of a wife, whose home is uninviting, the disorder that prevails in it, the dust and filth testifying to her laziness, who has 'I don't care' fixed in her mind and heart, who slowly but surely becomes ' frivolous' in the fullest sense of the word-such a father or such a mother cannot expect to bring up children to be an honor to them, and an honor to themselves and society; they having failed to keep their passions in check, they having failed to do their duty as man and woman, to lead a life of true purity and honorable use- fulness, they are doomed to bear the sad consequences of being despised by their fellow-men, and are not honored by their own offspring when they are yet among the living, and are quickly forgotten when they are dead." The grandfather paused, wiped the sweat from his brow, and continued with the same energy: "What a warnihg is this to those who have entered the holy bonds of matrimony. Let them be as true as steel to each other; let there beono other magnet between them ; let them resolve to lead a pure, virtuous, and useful life ; let the husband be up and doing at a fixed occuDation ; let the wife be careful not to irritate him with her personal behavior and useless expenditure; let her strive sincerely to be his talisman, his angel, and her home is heaven on earth ; and let them both rejoice in their mutual efforts to build up a good name, which inspires confidence in building up a solid home which will shield them against storm and winds in their advancing age; let them thrice re- joice if their love is blessed with children who will renew   OR, OUR DESTINY        139 their love as they grow older, and who will strew flowers be- fore them as they advance onward, onward, in the high esteem of their fellow-men; and when their soul, the picture of universal creation, goes home to Him who has given it, they will strew flowers over their remains, and remember them in their prayers." While the grandfather eloquently uttered these remarks, which the author humbly requests his kind reader forever to remember, the grandchildren, Augustus and Augustine, as husband and wife clasped each other's hands, and their eyes expressed their thoughts-we will be such a couple, true as steel to each other; there shall be no other magnet between us; we will do our whole duty to build up a name, a home, that will be an honor to us and to ours. Count Carl Von Mardeck and Miss Rosalind La Monte, both candidates for matrimony, thought that the grandfather uttered words of wisdom, but Mrs. John James La Monte, the born Bottwell, did not like the whole proceeding. To her, the reading and remarks made by the grandfather appeared like a prayer-meeting. She should have preferred it, if the grandfather would haVe quietly taken a seat in the corner and read the Bible for himself, and let the young-people have some fun, in which she could have joined ; and she hoped that the conversation would take another turn, when, to her great displeasure, Mr. Augustus Hunting remarked, "Science has made rapid advances in every department cx- cept in religion. The expounders of religion still cling to mysteries, and by their )reaching try to make it more mys- terious, and even now they endeavor to paln off on millions of Christians the idea that the Pope is infallible, and grad- ually dress him up as a living saint, who is to be more potent than God Almighty Himself. The tendency of such teach- ings has tlese effects: Thousands have lost respect for reli-  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7121-00000071"/> "O     "TIE FORGIVING KISS;" gion, and are thus delrived of its great blessings, which is not only an injury to them, but also to society. "What is actually needed, is to preach less of the saints, less of the future state of men, less about reward and pun- ishment, but more morality and the observance of the ten commandments; to be true as man and true as woman; not to shrink from the duty we owe to ourselves, to those who are near and dear to us, who have claims on our friendship; to be not only a consumer but also a producer, which adds to the comfort and wealth of society; to live and to let live; not to be too grasping, but to give a fellow-man also a chance, so that he can better his condition and advance intelligence and prosperity, and to remember that life is a bat- tle, and where there is-a battle there must be some wound- ed. They are those who have not received proper drilling in their childhood, who consequently lack energy, forethought, and perseverance; they find themselves shattered in body and broken in purse; it is a duty of the victorious sons and daughters to stretch forth a helping hand, and place them again in a position to get a livelihood, and prosper, and not become beggarly poor. Such are the sermons we need, and would, no doubt-" Mr. Augustus Hunting was interrupted by the appearance of Mr. John James La M'onte, who expressed his happiness at re- ceiving his guests, and turning to Mr. Augustus Hunting said, "Please continue your remarks." "Our topic has been a religious one, and I expressed my views of what sermons should be in all the places of worship." "I wish, Mr. La Monte, you could have come home a few moments sooner, and listened to the remarks of Mr. Hunt- ingg; they would have suited your views," said Mrs. La Monte, with a strange smile, which none except the husband understood. "Indeed, I am sorry I did not arrive sooner, and had   OR, OUR DESTINY.        I41 the pleasure of listening, for a sermon that ought to be preached in all the places of worship must have broad and deep wisdom, as a foundation on which an edifice can be built to hold all the sects; and the Lord knows how many there are on this planet of ours," answered Mr. La Monte, philosophically.  "It could be summed up in two words, not to be too grasping," observed Mrs. La Monte, eyeing her husband with a peculiar look. Mr. La Monte could hardly suppress his anger, for it touched him to the quick; for he had that strange tendency to charge a good round percentage to those who discounted at his bank, and many were the firms who, through his high rate of interest, became hopelessly insolvent, and thus scat- tered their once happy prospects to 'the four winds. He was aware of it, and therefore felt the taunt of being " too grasping," keenly. Recovering his usual self-command, he remarked, "It will be a pretty hard task for the ministers to preach not to be too grasping, when they themselves never can get enough. Look at the church of Rome; look at the churches of other denominations, how grasping they are after wealth; what they now possess is immense, and still they are always poor, always begging for more." Grandfather Hunting shook his head, and said approvingly, in a sad tone, "So it is, so it is," A vigorous pull was given at the front-door bell, and a clear manly voice rang throughout the hall, "Express!" to which the master of the house responded. "'Express!" repeated the express agent, evidently in a great hurry; "please sign a receipt for these three flowers and flower-pots; fifteen dol- lars and seventy-five cents express charges on them." "You do not mean to say that the express charges are fif- teen dollars and seventy-five cents?" inquired Mr. La Monte in astonishment. *   &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7121-00000072"/> 4t. -     I  ule ;U,  FJfZ'G AKISS;'"  "These are the charges. The Pacific mail steamer, and Pa- cific Railroad Company, and the express companies, want to be remunerated for carrying and handling freight," answered the express agent promptly, and in a business manner. "Carrying and handling freight which you hold in one hand  and for which they have the audacity to charge fifteen dollars and seventy-five cents! But I presume there is no use to argue about it. It is a soulless monopoly." He signed the re- ceipt, paid the icharges, and soliloquized: "I grasp, we grasp, they grasp, and the forty-second United States Congress en- acted a back-pay grab. 'To the victors belong the spoils,' is now carried on to an extent that would astonish that old veteran, President Andrew Jackson." He entered the re- ception-room, bringing with him three very rare plants, saying, "I have great pleasure in exhibiting to you flowers which have been sent to me by our consul at the court of the Flowery Empire. I value them highly, for they will be a val-  uable addition to my plants. May I invite you to my con- servatory, and show you my botanical treasures?" All accepted the invitation. Grandfather Hunting, Mr. and Mrs. La Monte headed and made up one group; Mr. andt Mrs. Augustus Hunting followed, and Count Carl Von Mardeck offered his arm to Miss Rosalind La Monte, which i! the young lady blushingly and hesitatingly accepted, and t slowly, as if by design, they followed their relatives.  "Your father seems to be quite an enthusiastic botanist."  "He studies vegetable physiology."            ; "That is a great study, and those who pursue it with en-  thusiasm are richly rewarded, not only by becoming aware of the great beauties of nature which surround 'us, but also by leading a calmer and more philosophical life. Have you  ever observed that persons who cultivate flowers, who love  flowers, are less apt to be tyrannical, less exacting, and of a [ sweeter d(isposition? Flowers are the living poetry of  , ;::   OR, OUR DESTINY.        143 nature; like music, they have the tendency to ennoble us-. "And make us look heavenward," responded the young lady, looking up. She met the eyes of the young Count, and a deep blush mantled over her lovely face, for it was that look which only appears, when the eyes that meet see in each other a world of beauty, of purity, of an everlasting bliss; that look which strengthens every nerve in our body, that strengthens us in our hopes, that girds us with a will which conquers every obstacle, that makes us bear with fortitude innumerable cares and responsibilities which rise mountain high; that look which makes of us giants, heroes, that makes us take. root and grow up like a mighty oak which withstands storm and wind, and which gives shelter as a whole or a part; that look which leads us, through our mutual affections, to a blessed matrimony, which makes of the restless youth the thoughtful man, and of the pleasure-seeking girl the care- ful woman, who feels her great dignity as a wife and mother in whose hand the honor and welfare of her husband and children rest; it is that look that lightens our cares, and makes us resolute to lead an honorable life, and a successful career; that look that gilds our dearest possession, the im- pression of which even death cannot efface, for the soul follows it even to the heavenly homes, there again to be united, never- more to part."

You, alas! I cannot hope to possess, but your image will keep me on the path of uprightness and duty, and thus at least I may be worthy of your friendship." Rosalind made no reply; they reached the conservatory. Mrs. La Monte greeted them pleasantly, with the remark, "( You have been slow in coming to see our bota,ic treasures."/ To which neither the Count nor Rosalind made any reply, and which Mrs. La Monte duly noticed; she perceived also the gloom that rested on the countenance of the Count, and the somewhat flushed cheeks of her daughter, and she mused, "Has the Count proposed, and Rosalind rejected him on the plea of being engaged. That would be just like her! Unhappy mother that I am, to have such a daughter, who would refuse the hand of a Count and prefer a shopkeeper. This will never do. I will enforce my maternal authority, and compel her to marry that nobleman." Mr. La Monte commented eloquently on his rare collec- tion of flowers and botanical specimens. He knew every flower by its name and origin, and the effect. flowers have upon our senses; he continued in an earnest strain: "On me the cultivation of flowers has produced a never- ceasing delight; it has wedded me closer to humanity; it has conquered to a large extent my prejudice and my ego- ism ; has taught me the great lesson of attraction to be drawn from the beauties of nature, to reflect on them, and see how the ' Slupreme JIMjcsly ' nurses and protects every parti- cle in whatever form it exists--no part exists without the other to sulpplement it, and none is fully beautiful alone  Shall then man be less to man?

Flowers in their mute lan- guage appeal to us with a resistless, unerring meaning: 'You wish me to bloom and sweeten the atmosphere with my delicious perfume; place me so that the sun can shine on me; study how much water I need, and let the industrious hand bestow it on me in the proper time ;' and those who re- spond to this rppeal are surrounded by a paradise of flowers that add so much to the charm of life. Hiumanity has the same appeal: 'Plac e we were the suZ can shine on me, study what I need to be prosperous, and bestow it on me in the proper time.' To respond to that appeal is our duty, and if we fail to perform that sacred duty, we are surrounded by a humanity which resembles poisonous thistles instead of sweet, fragrant flowers." "Bravo!" exclaimed Grandfather Hunting: "you have expressed my sentiments. Humanityis withal good ; every- body tries to be good, tries to better his conditibn. But.* how many are there who encourage the struggling in their worthy effort, give them a helping hand, and place them where the sun can shine on them and make them prosperous? Not only do the struggling ones receive no encouragement, but they are in many cases cruelly oppressed and discour- aged. Thousands become wicked through unjust legislation, through bitter discouragement and disappointment. Most men who through their natural capacities, or through superior education, become masters of their positions, are too busy, too selfish, to devote a part of their talent and wealth to the promotion of the welfare of their less fortunate fellow-men, and the consequences are that there are grave mistakes committed in legislation, in the education of our youth, in the manners of a community, in enacting and enforcing laws, in ?  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7121-00000074"/> I46     "THE FORGIVING KISS ;" the growing power of the monopolist, in the corruption of public officers, all of which have the strong tendency to make the rising generation less self-relying, less attached to self-re- spect; the rich richer, and the poor poorer; and this makes many human beings resemble poisonous thistles instead of sweet, fragrant flowers. I am therefore delighted that you, Mr. La Monte, have been attracted to the higher duties of life and respond to the appeal of humanity. Place me where the sun can shine on me, study what I need to be prosperous, and bestow it on me in the proper time." "Attraction," exclaimed Mr. Augustus Hunting: "the laws of attraction are as fixed as all other laws which gov- ern the universe with its teeming fluids, gases, geological, botanical, and animal inhabitations. Attraction is almost as essential to lead a happy life, as air, water, and ample room to move about in. Attraction is an invisible power, yet it is one of the strongest that exists; it binds the very ele- ments together. I verily believe that God is attracted to the human family with the same supreme love and confi- dence as good men are attracted to God with reverence, with love, with confidence in His grace, salvation, and everlasting bliss. Attraction has the most powerful bearing and influ- ence on our lives; well it is with those youths Wvho are attracted to playmates who are, by their yery nature and parental influences, honorable in their feelings and ambitious to achieve success; such playmates leave their indelible im- press on the mind. Well is it with those who have been at- tracted to learn a trade which gives man the capacity to domin- ate over matter. Thrice well it is with those who have been. attracted to marry not only a handsome face, a graceful fig- ure, splendid eyes, or a silky mustache, but a beautiful soul which is imbued with the noblest of principles, which like. an eagle will expand its mighty wings to protect its loved ones, and will soar high above the dust, high above tempta-   OR, OUR DESTINY.          147 tion, high above mean acts, too high to stoop to that which is low and contemptible. And those are the souls that need no palaces or a troupe of servants, in order to be happy; a few rooms, nay, a hut is sufficient; no furniture which only a railroad magnate could afford, no clothing which only a de- faulting cashier can pay for, grace their home and honora- ble bodies; plain furniture and plain clothes suffice for them. And thus they live and walk hand in hand, direct before God and man, attracted only by what is just, attracted to their holy love, to the fruits of that blessed love which they in 'union' try to bring up as models to society; and if they succeed in that, they have succeeded in everything. For without children, without good children, life has been a shadow, a failure; with them, a triumphant success. They will finish the work which our own defective education, and perhaps a defective life, has not permitted us to carry out. "Let me, with your leave, if my memory serves me right, quote from the immortal author: "'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear, Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use, Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear; Things growing to themselves, and growth's abuse, Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breathed beauty; Thou w    - begot-to get it is thy duty. "Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed, Unless the earth with thy increase be fed? By law of nature thou art bound to breed That thine may live when thou thyself art dead; And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive, In that thy likeness still is left alive.'" Mrs. Augustus Hunting blushed and cast a happy glance at her young husband, for she felt herself a mother; she felt she was a wife, and hoped to be a mother who would have patience and intelligence enough to bring up children who  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7121-00000075"/> "8     "TIEM FORGIVINVG KICSS; 1 should serve as models to society. Her loving husband understood her noble thoughts, and impressed on her one of those kisses in which two souls become closer united. Mrs. La Monte, the born Bottwell, felt almost angry with the remarks of Mr. Augustus Hunting, and exclaimed, ' You are only just married: that is the reason you wish so ardently for children. You do not know what trouble it is to bring them up-and when they have grown up they do not always obey." And she almost related how her daughter Viola married the son of her housekeeper, and Rosalind would not marry a Count; but her husband interrupted her by saying: "Count Carl Von Mardeck, have you seen our suburbs? they are pronounced the most magnificent on the continent; and if it suits my visitors, I will have my horses saddled, and we will all take a ride to view the grand scenery." "No, I thank you; some other time we will avail our- selves of the pleasant offer," answered the Count, promptly. "Do, please," responded Mr. La Monte; and the whole company left the conservatory, and the visitors soon left, promising to come some otlher morning and take the prom- ised drive. Mrs. La Monte related her good fortune in having en- gaged a ladylike woman, whom his Grace the Archbishop had recommended, and whom she thought would more than fill the place just vacated by Mrs. Wehlen. Mr. La Monte made no response; in fact, he hardly listened to his wife. His thoughts were occupied with the bank; the notes he had discounted that day; the amount of money on deposit; the probable course the stock-market would take, and whether it would be advisable to buy some particular stocks just now for an advance: a few thousand dollars could be thus made easily, provided he could but hit the right time to buy. To hit that time was the uppermost thought in his mind, and this is, alas! the fault of many a husband and   OR, OUR DESTINY.        19 father who .keeps continually thinking how he can grow still wealthier, and thus pay but little attention to the selec- tion of those whom he receives into his home, or the per. sons with whom his children associate, and this negligence leads to family catastrophes which not only swallow up the accumulated wealth, but what is far more valuable, the good reputation, and send the parents dishonored to an un- timely grave. Far better to have less property, less worldly honors, but have a home in which none but those who are honorable and with pure motives enter; have a home in which the spirit of the commandments rules supreme, in which the wife acts as a priestess, whose thoughts are not bounded by vanity of being the most expensively dressed, of having the grandest house, the finest carriages, and the most spirited horses, in order to excite the envy of her neigh- bors and acquaintances, but whose aim is to be beautiful i . life; to have not only children who are beautiful in person, but beautiful in behavior; in whom the principles of honor and dignity are instilled ; who have been trained to obey, not because they must, but because it is right that they should. For such a home, such a wife, such children, almost undi- vided attention is required, and the more attention we be- stow on our home, on wife and children, the more we are apt to enjoy the true blessings of life, for a good home in which purity and peace dwell, with an angelic wife as its directing spirit, and children who are obedient, is the genuine comfort, the genuine pleasure. All the rest we may possess is also desirable; but compared to a good, orderly home, to a good wife and mother, with loving, obedient children, a mere nothing. This being the fact, it behooves every man to de- vote the greatest part of his thoughts to his home, to his wife and to his children. Mr. La Monte having failed to do this, has trained a wife full of vanity, and nothing else, which bitter fruits he will be conipelled to swallow.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7121-00000076"/> 150     " "TIR FORGIVING KISS;" CHAPTER VI.

LA MONTE was glad that her husband did not V I I enter into the particulars of the engagement of Sister Hulda narrated in the last chapter, and forth- with ordered Jim to take Sister Hulda to the city in the " par- cel teamh," and bring back her trunk and bag. Sister Hulda availed herself of the opportunity to question Jim about the family, and ask whether Mr. La Monte were hard to please, whether Mrs. La Monte were good-natured and Miss Rosa- lind received company, and all about the prospects of a speedy wedding, all of which queries Jim answered with abruptness. This Sister Hulda quickly noticed, and changed the topic, saying, "In Germany we have an idea that the colored people resemble the apes, but I find it a mistaken idea. The colored man in the ' United States' is not only straight and strong-limbed, but has a broad, deep chest, a well-proportioned neck on which a well-shaped head firmly   OR, OUR DESTINY.       I15 sits, with intelligent eyes and thoughtful features. The handsome teeth compensate for the dark complexion." Jim smiled, and soliloquized, "That girl tries to softsoap me. This child is too smart for that." Sister Hulda continued: "As for the colored woman, our European princesses would feel proud if they were as beau- tifllly shaped as they are. In all my travels I have never seen women with such neat waists as the colored women generally seem to possess. The Greek sculptors could not chisel them more artistically than nature has made them." This compliment softened the suspicious Jim. He cracked his whip, saying, "The colored ladies have some- thing queenly about them, that's a fact. I like them well." "No wonder you do," quickly interrupted Sister Hulda, "for is there anything more beautiful in God's creation than a neat, tidy figure of a woman, with a neat, slim waist, eyes that shine as bright as the stars, and teeth that resemble pearls? To be sure you like them well, and have, no doubt, selected the handsomest of them all for your sweetheart. I wish you success. What is your name?" "My name is George Washington, but Mr. La Monte when he engaged me said that I would be called, for con- venience sake, Jim.' I had no objection, and am there- fore called ' Jim ' by the whole family." "Jim is short and sweet," observed Sister Hulda. "And how long have you been in the employ of the La Montes?" "Many, many years," observed Jim, proudly. "So you know all about them. Tell me who were the parents of Mr. La Monte and the parents of Mrs. La Monte. You will think me inquisitive, but you must remember that I am engaged to stay with the family for many years, and it is but natural that I should wish to know. Tell me all; I will consider it a favor, and return it willingly at some future time."  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7121-00000077"/> 152     "THE FORGIVING kIS;" ; 'That woman is going to be the real mistress of the.  house; she is devilish smart. I imust keep on a good foot- ing with her," giving a s1harp crack with his whip which made the spirited horses start at a brisk trot. "Don't drive so fast, Jim ; please don't; it makes me feel dizzy; drive slowly, and tell me all about the family with whom I have chosen my home." "She is not a common servant: she has chosen to stay with the La Montes," thought Jim, drawing in the lines; and he commenced to say that Mr. John James La Monte, now a millionnairc, was the son of a washerwoman, and Mrs. John James La Monte, who has now a million of dollars of her own, and is the greatest aristocrat in the State, is the grand- child of a ragpicker and the gatherer of kitchen refuse, an occupation which laid the foundation of her great present wealth. "No one is good enough for her to condescend to associate with ; no one is grand enough for her to give him her daughter in marriage. Her greatest ambition is to marry her daughter Rosalind to a baron, a count, or a duke if pos- sible. IBut Miss Rosalind is a sensible girl; she is in love with a young merchant, Charles Hunting, whom she will marry or remain forever single. Her other daughter married Otto Wehlen, the teller of the bank, a son of the former housekeeper, Mrs. Wehlen, who was reported to. be worth a miillion of dollars, but whose title to the property proved worthless, and this troubles Mrs. La M1onte greatly. She is maturing a plan to bring about a separation, a divorce b1e- tween the young people; but Mr. La Monte will not con- sent to such proccedings, and this makes trouble between husband and wife. Mrs. Wehlen was always the messenger of peace between them, but now she is gone. Who will fill her place?" A close observer could have observed a grim smile rest- ing on the placid features of Sister Hulda, who inwardly re-   OR, OUR DESTINY.        153 joiced at the opportunity of fanning that spark of discontent between husband and wife, into a bright flame that would consume them both so much the quicker. "And are you sure," she continued, " that you are not misinformed that Mr. La Monte is worth a million of dollars, and Mrs. La Monte is also worth a million?" "I am sure they are worth as much, if not more. I over- heard their conversation. They are rich, very rich," answered Jim earnestly. "And in what is the money invested? ' "Mr. La Monte has it nearly all in cash and railroad stocks, on which he has to pay no taxes; and Mrs. La Monte has her million all in five-twenty United States bonds. They follow the advice of old Mr. Bottwell, who recom- mended them to have their property so invested as not to pay any taxes and assessments. 'Let the merchants, man- ufacturers, and the owners of the soil pay the taxes,' he used to say, 'and you reap the benefit of it.' He argued that to pay taxes consumes a share of the marrow of the estate; and besides, the taxes paid are foolishy squandered by city, county, and State officials. It is therefore best to pay as little taxes as at all possible, and this Mr. and Mrs. La Monte religiously observe." "And are they in other ways religious?" asked Sister Hulda persuasively. "They do not trouble themselves much about religion. Mr. La Monte prefers not to drive to church; to stay at home, smoke his fine Havanas, read the papers and maga- zines, and make himself generally comfortable, in which he is not contradicted, provided Mrs. La Monte has not a new dress or bonnet to wear, for Mrs. La Monte does not care to drive to church unless she has a new dress; then she is religious enough to go, otherwise she stays at home under the excuse of being unwell or fatigued." 7*  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7121-00000078"/> 154     "TtHE FORGI VING KISS;" "You are a clever observer," remarked Sister Hulda, good-naluredly) patting him on his shoulder. "I like to observe the notions of the great people; they are sometimes very queer," said Jim aside. "And how is Miss Rosalind on the subject of religion? Is she, like her mother, inclined to go to church when she has a new dress to wear?" asked Sister Hulda, archly. "Miss Rosalind never goes to church, unless it is an- nounced that the retired minister of their church will preach a sermon. Then she is sure to go whether it rains or snows, for she likes to hear the old minister; she says he preaches from the heart to the heart, while the young, fashionable minister preaches vanity to vanity, which she does not care to hear. When she does not go to church she calls all the servants together in the dining-hall, reads several passages from the Bible, and then expounds them in a style that brings the tears to our eyes. Miss Rosalind is a lovely lady;  she is the star of the house; you will like her if you like any- body in the house." Sister Hulda turned aside, smiled contemptuously, and nult- tered: "Like Rosalind Ia Monte! I hate her with all the hate of my nature. I see in her the only obstacle to rule that family for the benefit of the order of our church. To conquer her is not sufficient. To crush her is a necessity, and at which I will not hesitate, for now it is not only a question of one, but of two millions of dollars!" At that thought her eyes flashed a strange light, her nostrils expanded, her lips became firmly compressed, while her hands quivered as if she liked to grasp the rich millions. Recovering her  usual serenity, she asked, "And how about the neighbors. -do they visit at the La Montes?" "Not often, although they are very nice people. Mrs. La Monte does not encourage their visits, for they are not as rich, and Mrs. La Monte only considers those her equals   OR, o0R1 DESTINY.        I55 who have as much wealth as she is possessor of; and as there are only a few as rich as she, there are only a few who visit and whose visits are returned." "And how does the family pass the evening? without visit- ors it must be lonely. And is the place safe at night from marauders?" questioned Sister Hulda earnestly. "If the weather is pleasant, they all ride out; if the weather is not agreeable, they spend the evening in reading. Miss Rosalind plays and sings so that it makes the hills re- sound. Mrs. La Monte retires early, for she believes that going to bed early preserves her beauty; to preserve a handsome face is her greatest care. Some one recommended her to wash her face with fresh rain-water, which has the effect of making the complexion clear and youthful. And she prays for daily rain, and never feels happier than when- it pours so that she can have fresh rain-water by the pailful; then the face-washing goes on for hours. I said before that the rich people had queer notions, and so they have, I swear. As for the marauders to molest our place is out of the ques- tion : we have a splendid watch-dog. ' Warrant' is a power- ful sentinel; bad luck to those that come to the place with a view of harm ; he would tear them to pieces in the twinkling of an eye." "I guess if the burglars threw him a fresh piece of meat he would amuse himself with eating it, and let the burglars quietly proceed," observed Sister Hulda. "Warrant would not eat from any hand but Miss Rosa- lind's or mine. Miss Rosalind has trained him so that he growls at everybody who offers him anything to eat, and considers it an insult he would readily resent upon strangers with a few powerful bites. I tell you Warrant is a remlark- able dog. Whom Warrant don't lik&amp;eon the premises de- serves to be watched."  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7121-00000079"/> I56     "7YIE FORGIVING KISS;" , Sister Hulda grew a shade paler at that piece of news, and  Jim continued:  "Besides that extraordinary watch-dog, it is known that  Mr. La Monte is the best marksman in the State; he is a dead shot. You will be surprised at his feats of shooting;  he will hit the 'bull's-eye' every time. Burglars are apt to ,; avoid such a house when the master is such a dead shot." This, too, was unpleasant news to Sister Hulda, for he might i get angry, and an angry man who is such a dead shot might prove dangerous to those who arouse his anger. And she  silently reflected on all she learned from the talkative Jim,  and resolved to be careful.                  i They reached the city, and stopped at the boarding-house  where Sister Hulda had her trunk and bag. She requested Jim to wait; she wanted to make a call on a friend, which  might take thirty minutes, and with eager speed she hastened , toward the Archbishop's residence to have an interview  with Father Ignatius. Ignatius Garnier, who passed as the secretary to his Grace the Archbishop, was about thirty-eight years old, of mediuml  stature, well built and strongly knit; his chest was broad and  1owevrfill, supI orted by strong limbs and arms ; his neck was  manly; his head well shaped in front, but the back was some- what too pointed, showing that excessive pride and animal passions largely predominated; his brow was massive ; his eye coal black and piercing; his nose prominent and aqui- line; his mouth had the savage lines of the bull-dog, which in connection with his heavy chin and strong jaw-bone, indi-  cated strong passion and fixed determination to conquer ob-  stacles at every price. His complexion was of a dark hue, showing that he was of Italian descendants. Father Igna- tius was very joyous, for a special messenger from Rome had brought him the glad tidings that he had been appointed as the head of all the Jesuits of the United States, as a recogii-   OR, OUR DESTINY.        157 tion of his marked services rendered to the order, and for his clear and practical plan for the future operations in the United States, Canada, and other British provinces, submitted to the general at Rome, which had been highly commended and intrusted to his care to be carried out to the very letter. ' But who is this messenger?" inquired Father Ignatius, "that he has come 'not only as a messenger, but also as a spy-on that I have no doubt. But what is his position in the order? what relations does he bear to his chief? These are important questions. For all I know, he may be the General Beckx himself. This explains why the chief objects to be photographed. At all events, be he who he may, my course is clear:-to be on my guard. Caution, great caution is of the essence of our order; I will observe him.. 1, will observe him," repeated he, "but while observing him let me treat him with great civility; this costs onlyattention, and may bear good fruit." He rang the bell, and a prelate of the lower order answered the call. "Brother Paulus will please order my dinner to be served in my private sitting- room, the table to be set for two. -Make a memoranda of what I want: first, young chicken soup with six young pig- eons roasted and stuffed with bread soaked in butter; a breast of veal, roasted, also stuffed; chicken pie, fried oysters, stewed oysters, green peas,- mashed potatoes, firied potatoes, rasp- berry pie, sliced tomatoes, a few pounds of Malaga grapes, apples, pears, and a few bottles of the best champagne, with a few bottles of Ungersheimer '65 chambertin to be placed on ice. Dinner to be as usual well prepared and served pre- cisely at four, Frantz to serve at the table." Brother Paulus bowed and left the room, musing on his way, '"The deaf and dumb Frantz to wait at the table shows that this is to be a diplomatic dinner; I must post myself in the closet to hear the conversation; but this is too risky: Father Ignatius is so sly."  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7121-00000080"/> 158     'T TIE FORGIVING KISS;" Precisely at four the dinner was announced ready, and Father Ignatius escorted his guest to the table with great courtesy. "Please be seated, Father Pontifus, and consider yourself at home. I, my servants, and whatever I possess are at your command: the contents of my cellar, with its rare vintage, and all." "Kind, very kind!" exclaimed Father Pontifus with nat- ural grace. Glancing at the well-supplied table he said, "I see you fare as plainly here as we do in Rome." Both the fathers smiled. "Yes, we try to make a meal. Let me serve you with some of this chicken soup," observed Father Ignatius. Father Pontifus readily offered his plate, and commenced to partake of it, with the remark, "This soup is delicious; your cook is a true chef." "Yes," replied Father Ignatius, "I am very glad to have secured the services of a good cook; it is as essential to the body as the right kind of books are to the mind." "To be sure it is; a good cook is of more importance to one's happiness than good books." Father Ignatius pricked his ears at this remark of Father Pontifus, and said to himself, "Did he say this in earnest, or was it only to mislead me. However, I am on my guard." "What wine do you prefer: chambertin, Ungersheimer, or champagne?" asked Father Ignatius with a pleasant bow. "I never drink red wine at my meals. I like champagne well, but it is not advisable for a priest to drink it, as it has the tendency to arouse the electricity of manhood to almost an uncontrollable mood ; and being absent from home, Ungersheimer or Rhine wine will do." "That man is of a low order; he is not much more than a beast," mused Father Ignatius.; and 'while serving his guest, he good-naturedly said, "You know the old proverb, He is the strongest who can keep his passions in check."   OR, OUR DESTINY.        159 "This is a very wise proverb, but it is still wiser not to arouse our passions; it requires so much less effort to keep them in check. I will take, with your permission, another glass of your excellent Ungersheimer." "Certainly, help yourself, just as if you were under your own roof," answered Father Ignatius hospitably. "I will. Waiter, bring larger tumblers, it saves the trouble of filling them so often," said Father Pontifus. The waiter did not move, which aroused the anger of the father, who was used to be obeyed at a nod, and which Father Ignatius quickly noticed, and observed  "Frantz is deaf and dumb;" and he motioned to him by dumb alphabet to bring larger tumblers, and a few more bottles of Ungersheimer. "It is a capital idea to have a waiter at the table who is deaf; he cannot report the conversation. But did you hear of that celebrated Doctor Aristotle, who had the same idea, only to employ deaf and dumb waiters, in order that they could not make use of the art which he practised in their presence? Once a very emiinent man called on the doctor, bringing his wife with him, saying that she had taken a walk in the garden, and while resting on the bench, fell asleep, and had ever since suffered a severe headache, and finally became totally deranged, and offered the doctor a very large fee if he could cure the unfortunate lady. The doctor undertook to cure her, on condition that she be left entirely under his own charge, and he to treat the case as a matter of life or death. The husband reluctantly consented. The doctor gave the patient a draught to sleep for twenty-four hours, and after she had slept soundly, cut open the scalD, which revealed the brain, oh which a grass-worm leisurely crept. The doctor was on the point of picking up the worm with his knife, when his deaf and dumb servant exclaimed, in a commanding voice, ' Halt, doctor! your touching that  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7121-00000081"/> I6o     "TILE FORGIVING KISS;"    .        , worm with the point of your knife would forever injure the brain, or kill the patient. Get a grean leaf, and the worm will crawl on it.' You can imagine the doctor's surplrise that the waiter he had for years and years thought deaf  and dumb could hear and speak well." "The dumbness and deafness of your waiter may also be assumed for a purpose," said Father Pontifus, eyeing his host keenly. "I know that he was born deaf and dumb, and being good-natured, I took him into my employ," answered Father Ignatius readily. "To have a good-natured servant is one of the blessings of life. These pigeons are splendid: I will help myself to another. In Germany they have a saying that America is a country where roast pigeons fly into one's mouth; it has the effect of inducing epicures to emigrate. There is something in that common remark-' All the delicacies of the season paid for by a well-filled purse.' In Europe only the best class live thus. America is indeed the country for the poor who want to toil and have something for their labor," observed Father Pontifius; peering into the chicken-pie, and-trying to select the choicest morsels. "The United States of America is perhaps the only land on the whole globe which is inhabited by a people which almost to a man hlave one fixed p)urpose in view; and that purpose is to make money. It is the natural consequence of emigration. Every emigrant who arrives comes for the pur- pose of bettering his condition; and to accomplish that he must work hard and endeavor to be richly paid for his labor; and in a new country, where so much is to be done, he can more readily obtain work than in an'old country." "And do the Catholics observe all the holy days," asked Father Pontifus, cutting a nice slice of veal and filling his glass again.   OR, OUR DESTINY.        161 "The women as a rule do, but the men only partly so. For instance, a laboring man told his priest that he considered it more religious to work and earn the bread for his family honorably, than to keep a holy day and let them suffer on account of it. As for Sunday, he considered it a day of bodily rest and mental elevation. We have our eyes on that man for fear he will go astray," remarked Father Ignatius. "And what preventives will you use? for I presume you )elieve in the principle that one ounce of prevention is bet- ter than a pound of cure.". "I most decidedly believe in that wise principle, and practice it, that the laborer's position is now receiving careful attention, and as soon as we ascertain the strong and weak points of his character, the religious feeling of his wife and associates, we will set to work, not only to keep him within the pale of the church, but use whatever ability he possesses for the promotion of its interest. We have found some excellent material among the lower classes, whom we have elevated to high political positions; while others we have advanced to prominent merchants, bankers, master me- chanics, and large public contractors, and they invariably serve the church's interest well." "This is as it should be, and it makes 'Rome' great everywhere," remarked Father Pontifus proudly. "Great everywhere, except in Rome herself," replied Father Ignatius in an angry tone. Father Pontifus laid down his knife and fork, and ex- claimed, "Do you mean to find fault with the management at Rome?" "I cannot at this distance find fault with the management at Rome, as I am not thoroughly acquainted with the diffi. culties that beset the European affairs; but so much is sure, that the managers have not been equal to the task, for Rome has lost her grip on the direction of great public affairs; she  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7121-00000082"/> 62     "T THE FORGIViNG KISS;" is no longer the Rome she was a quarter of a century ago." "I admit this to be a fact," admitted Father Pontifus sadly, "but it is not the fault of the Pope and his advisers; it must be traced to the changed public spirit of 1848, when all Europe was up and in arms to gain its liberty, and the mon- archs found it necessary to compromise with the people, gave' them enough liberty to be emancipated from the church, and recognized the Jews as citizens of the land, and these hate- ful descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the most formidable enemies of the Roman secretary. They with their matchless eloquence and mighty pens ridicule the im- perial assumption of the holy father. 'It is they who, in every capital, form public opinion, which all the machina- tions of our holy order, and the power of Rome, ,can not counteract. There are no other such determined opponents to be encountered. These are men who for eighteen centuries have been trained to combat for their religious views and natu- ral rights. They possess all the great qualities difficult to con-  quer, namely, native intelligence highly cultivated, coupled with great energy, sustained with an unrelenting will, backed by great wealth and unlimited credit, and they use these advantages in a masterly manner," observed Father Pon- tifus. "The only sure way to conquer a formidable opponent, is to make a friend and ally of him," replied FatherIgnatius thoughtfully. "But if Rome allies herself with these Israelites and their followers, she must first surrender her traditional principles, namely, that the church is above, the state, and the state must be governed according to the dictates of the church; that the confession to the priest shall be sacredly observed by all without distinction; that the Pope shall be considered infallible, and as the highest authority in the church and   OR, OUR DESTINY. /       I63 state, and his priests ever to be obeyed in everything that most nearly concerns the welfare of man. Can Rome give up these grand ideas? She might as well cease to exist; she will cease to exist if the ideas of the Israelites tritumph. They say that the church has. nothing to (do with the state; that the people should enact their own laws and execute them ; that sins can be atoned for without the aid of a priest, through sincere repentance and through a multitude of good deeds; that it is the duty of every man and every woman to be a priest and a priestess unto them- selves, and that paid priests are only teachers whose funcr tions are to assist their congregations in their elevating re- ligious thoughts, to make them free in the fullest sense, free from task-masters, free from enslaving passions, free froml prejudice, free from fear of. death, and hopeful of a happy present and a glorious future hereafter. These ideas have been so eloquently expressed and explained, that the whole of Europe has accepted them as wise council, and incorporated them into systems of government, with terrible effect against the Roman Church. To change that system, and those sen- timents, is now the main aim of Rome. This will sufficiently explain to you why the power of Rome has declined, and what obstacles she has to encounter, to regain in Europe her former grandeur. But what are the pros)pects for the Roman Catholic Church in the United States?" asked Father Pontiff s anxiously. "The prospects for its future prosperity are so grand that it makes one almost dizzy to contemplate them. Every- thing is in our favor; and if nothing extraordinary slouldl happen, the Roman Catholics will in less than half a century control the United States government and own almost all the property of the country, for they will outnumber three to one of any other faith," answered Father Ignatius with much enthusiasm.  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7121-00000083"/> I64     TTIL' FORGIVING KIrSS;" "Ulpon what do you base such an opinion?" asked Father Pontifus. "M/y basis for such an opinion is the prevailing crime, that exists in this country-child prevention. High and low are practising that horrible crime without the blush of shame, without the least repugnance, without regard for the consequences to morality, health, and the de- creasing population. Every denomination is more or less affected with this fashionable dark murder, and fashionable ministers close their fashionable eyes to this deep-dyed crime, and pass it by with grave silence. Slowly but surely grow the families less in number, and weaker in frame, and one by one drop into their graves, and gradually whole fam- ilies pass out of existence. But this is happily not the case with the Roman Catholics. None would dare to practise that abominable crime, and hope to receive from their priest absolution for their terrible sins, extreme unction, and the Lord's Supper. The happy consequences are, that the Rloman Catholic families are now as numerous and vigorous as they were of yore; and while all decrease, they increase, and to them will belong the honors and the land."  "Are you not mistaken?" asked Father Pontifus eagerly. "As sure as I am that my name is Ignatius, so sure am I that the crime I have referred to exists to an extent that strikes at the very root of the nation." "It cannot exist to that extent, or the legislative body, the pulpit, the press, and the courts would surely give it due attention," remarked Father Pontifus, uncorking a bottle of champagne in a manner which showed that he was no nov- ice at the work. "This is one of the great drawhacks under which the United States suffer. It is the strife of one political party to oust the party in power. To accomplish it, and for one party to retain power, and the other party to obtain it, consulme   OR, OUR DESTINY.        I65 the most valuable energies; and real measures which would benefit the body politic are thus totally neglected; the pul- pit is divided by party cries, and most of the prelates have not the moral courage to speak as they should and would- like." "The press does not like to dish up before their readers topics which are unpalatable and they pass it by with the excuse, It is an evil, which will cure itself. As for the courts, I do not recollect whether it has ever reached the courts," answered Father Ignatius, accepting the proffered glass of champagne. "Let us drink to the grand prospects of the Roman Catholic religion, and its power in the United States." Both priests arose from their chairs, emptied their tum- blers, which Father Ignatius again filled, and said, "Now let us drink to your health, Father Pontifus, and when you again reach Rome, may you be welcomed as a cardinal." "Thanks, thanks," responded the guest, emptying his tumbler; and filling it and that of his host, he proposed, "Let us now drink to the health of Father Ignatius, di- rector of all the Jesuits of the United States, Canada, and the British provinces. May his power never grow less, and increase as he increases in wisdom and experience." They drank to this toast also standing. The glasses were again filled, and Father Ignatius pro- posed to drink to the health-of the Pope, "The aged sage who is ripe in age and ripe in wisdom." They drank to this toast with bowed heads. Father Pontifus now uncorked another bottle of cham- pagne, filled the glasses, and proposed to drink to the health of the sisters, who are so indefatigable in their labors in be- half of the order and the church. They drank this toast standing erect, and with glee. Father Pontiftus again filled the glasses, and proposed:  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7121-00000084"/> i66     "THE FORGIVINVG KISS;" "Now let us drink to the future prosperity of our order, which takes root everywhere. Mzundus vult decipi." They drank to that toast with one energetic draught. Father Pontifus again filled the glasses. "Not for me!" begged Father Ignatius. "'Then I jnust drink for both, for I propose now to drink to the health of his Grace the Archbishop of this rich diocese ;" and Father Pontifus emptied both glasses in quick succession. Father Ignatius thought, "That Father Pontifus drank wine as a fish drinks water, and does not get drunk. I would like to see him intoxicated; perhaps he would then disclose who he really is, and for what purpose he comes to the United States." With this object in view, he encouraged his guest to empty one bottle of champagne after another, but it had no effect on Father Pontifus. Seeing this, Father Ignatius motioned the waiter to leave the room, and said to himself, "I must try to make him senseless with my Havanas, which I keep under lock and key, and will bring them myself." With this last remark, Father Ignatius left the room, opened a secret drawer in his bureaut, from which he brought forth a closed casket, from which, when opened, a green-like vapor evapor- ated. He took from the same casket a few cigars. Smelling them, he remarked: "They are well saturated; a few whiffs from one of these cigars will make him sink froni his chair under the table." At the same time, he took from his cigar- case one cigar for himself, and returned to his guest, to whom he offered a cigar taken from the strange casket. He lit his cigar' first, and then offered one to Father Pontifus, who ac- ce pted one. Hardly had he given a dozen whiffs, when the cigar fell from his hand, his eyes rolled strangely in the sock- ets, the eyelids became heavy, and closed as if life were extinct.   OR, OUR DESTINY.        167 Father Ignatius quickly bolted the doors of the room, and exclaimed with a fiendish exultation, "Thou glutton, I have you now completely in my power; let me find out what you have about you!"And with these words yet on his lips, he resolutely set to work. He loosened the outer gar!ents, pulled them off, and felt round his waist. "Yes, he has a belt about him, just as I expected i" He raised the under- garments, and saw a broad leather belt, closely fitting to the body, but with no clasps. The whole belt seemed as if riv- eted round the body. A shade of deep disappointment passed over the face of Ignatius, and he uttered fierce oaths. "Let me swear less, and work better; fools swear, wise men are calm ; let me be calm, and try to ascertain whether these rivets are not connected with some spring." He turned and rolled the sleeping man around as if he were a log, but he could not find the secret of unfastening that mysterious belt. "This belt so carefully fastened round the body contains documents, which secrets I ought to know." He took the carving-knife firom the table, and was about to cut the belt; he paused, reflected, and concluded not to cut; firstly, he might cut valuable papers; secondly, it would be an evidence against him that he had seen the documents, and their se- cret might be of such a nature as to endanger his proud position, and even life itself. "Let me see what else he has about him." He soon found round his neck a-small gold chain, to which a gold locket was attached, and which nestled near his breast. He opened the locket, which con- tained the picture of a middle-aged lady. "This picture does not resemble him; it is not his sister, but his sweetheart: he is in love." Looking still closer at the picture, he thought, "How familiar the features of this picture are to me! I am sure I have. seen the original before. Who can it be? Who can it be?" repeated he, trying hard to recall when and where he had seen the lady. "Ha!" exclaimed he sav-  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7121-00000085"/> t     Z ^0A% A , W - .-I - A - J ;- I agely, "It is Hulda, my prot6g'S. She has been sent from J Rome to spy upon me.

HFulda is an extraordi- nary woman, worthy of my attention."' At this moment a strange knock was given at the door. "What! do I hear correctly? The knock of distress of our order at my door. I  must answer that call, even though it should cost my life."  He quickly replaced the locket, buttoned only partly up the  clothes of the sleeping father, and when the mysterious knock was repeated, he unbolted the door, and Sister Hulda  stood before him erect and resolute. "Why that sign of distress?" asked Father Ignatius, in a surprised and angry tone, standing in the door. "Please let me, in and give me a chair, for I feel that I  shall faint." "Come in." Offering her a chair, he at the same time pulled the bell twice, to which Brothers Paulus and Frantz responded. "Brother Paulus, my guest drank so heartily that he  fainted; you and Frantz will assist me to carry him to the . nearest sleeping apartment, where you will apply restora- tives," commanded Father Ignatius, eyeing Sister Hulda at the same time, who was preparing to faint in an artistic manner, but who nevertheless noticed that Father Ignatius observed her closely. As soon as she was left alone, she I  ,-i   OK, OUR DzESTINy.       169 exclaimed, "It is--it is his Eminence! I never knew him to get intoxicated ; he has no doubt been dr!gged. Father Ignatius is an unscrupulous man1. Can a Jesuit be other- wise than unscruDulo us?-and as he is now the director of the Jesuits of America, he has the right to be unscrupulous. I must court his good-will; and nothing secures to a oman the good-will of a man so quickly as to arouse in him pity for her; many a woman has secured a good husbanld, not through her loveliness or superior intelligence, but through pity; to arouse pity in a man's breast is woman's strongest point. I will manage that, and ths secure the good-will of Father Ignatius, then rule him, and through him the whole order." She heard footsteps, and quickly placed herself in a fainting position, and, to all ailearances, seemed lifeless. Fatler Ignatius, on reaching the room, hastened to Sister Hulda, slowly took her haandand felt her pulse, and gazed on her face with great admiration, and said, '"She is truly beautifil! but what character is covered by that beautiful lask ; none know it positivey, only He whomn we call God-- Hle who has formed the leart-He knoivs its innermost s&amp;- crets, but man knows them n)ot; man only can guless-and to guess correctly is the essence of wisdom.

Those whom they often consider wickedl are saints colmpared with. those whom they consider good. The more one knows of mankind, the more he is com- pelled to acknowledge God's boundless forbearance." With this acknowledgment yet on his lips, Father Ignatius took from his amnlple breast-pocket a wallet containing several vials carefully labelled; fromi one he removed the stopper dropped five drops into a spoon, and after replacing the vial into its notch in the wallet, and placing it again in his am- ple breast-pocket, he took the spoon containing the chem-    &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7121-00000086"/> I70l    "TILE F ORGIV r NG t'SS; " ical preparation, applied a burning matcll to it, and in an instant the whlle room resembled a mass of burning flame. Sister Hulda sprang firol her chair alarimed, exclaiming, "Is the house ol fire?" ' No; I only wanted to revive you. from your fainting," replied Father Ignatius, meaningly. "That is a strange restorative which you are pleased to employ," answered Sister Hulda, nervously. "It is a mode of my own. What do you do to revive people from a faint?" asked Father Ignatius. "I apply fresh air, cold water, and brandy; with some camphor wash the face, head, and handsl6, and give them a good rubbing at the same time," answered Sister Hulda. "Will you please come with me? A Father, Pontifus by name, arrived lately from Rome; I invited him to dinner. The good mnan ate and drank so heartily that he fainted as you arrived; we carried him to one of the sleeping apart- ments, and have tried to revive hil, but without success; follow me this way." Sister Hulda readily followed; and when she reached the room, and beheld the deadly pallor resting on the features of Father Pontifus, she exclaimed quickly, "Open all the win- dows; bring cold water, brandy, and camphor!" Her or- ders were promptly obeyed, and energetically were the rem- edies applied to the senseless man. Gradually he came back to consciousness; and as soon as he recognized Sister Hulda he gave an unearthly shriek, begging piteously, Take her away, take her away! this room is filling up with the spirits of the dead whom she has murdered with her lur- ing eyes, her tongue, and deadly poisons! take her away! I see not only the spirits of the dead, but their very bones rising from their graves, seeking revenge; take her away " repeated he. Springing froml the bed, he commenced the dance of fantasia with an uncontrollable fury. Father Ig-   OR, OUR DESTINY.         7 171 natius, Brothers Paulus, Frantz, and Sister Hulda, all tried to hold him, and if possible to pacify him, but he threw them aside as if they were paper dolls. Suddenly he .dropped down a corpse. For a moment all in the room seemed as if paralyzed. Father Ignatius bent down, felt the pulse, and sadly said, ' His spirit is fled! may the divine power of Jesus, that has guided him on earth, guide. his soul before the throne of grace, and may it everlastingly dwell among the blessed saints who have toiled for our church!" "Dead, under the roof of his Grace the Archbishop, with- out the aid of a priest to confess, receive absolution and extreme unction," moaned Sister Hulda. "Those who die in delirium cannot expect to receive in their supreme hour priestly aid and the holy sacraments; they made themselves unfit and unworthy of those great blessings," remarked Father Ignatius. It required the assistance of all in the room to place the corpse on the bed. Sister Hulda wept silently, and her lips moved as if in prayer, which Father Ignatius carefully no- ticed, and said, "Let us all pray, my children," motioning Frantz to kneel. All except Father Ignatius fell on their knees, and with folded hands and bowed heads prayed for the departed soul. Father Ignatius bowed over the dead body, and while he prayed aloud, quickly removed Sister Hulda's portrait, which he carefully hid away. He concluded his prayer with Pax Vobiscm, "peace be with you, my children," and he left the room, giving a sign to Sister Hulda to follow him. On reaching his study, he said, It will never do to let the world know that Father Pontifius died of delirium ; we must say that he died firom convulsions, while under the influence of an epileptic fit. I will so report it to his Grace." "And will his Grace not inquire into the particulars of the  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7121-00000087"/> 172     "T HE7 FORGIVING KISS; " sudden death under his own roof?

" Indeed, you are - of great assistance to him, I know, and are therefore fully aware of the demands made upoi his tilme; but, father, I think you could do hlis work lnore quickly and better than he does; you otught to be the archbishop-and, ohl can I not help you to become so ?" ' You are not only very bleaLtiful, very wise, but also very complimentary. I feel flattered by your remark, and am obliged for your proffered aid ; but before we proceed into the plans of the future, it would ple1ase me if you would give me a glimpse iinto yonr, past, and explain why Father Pontiffus should have shown suchI horror when he recognized you ?" Sister Hulda grew somewlhat pale, but she quickly recov- ered her usual color, and readily answered, " We have noth- ing to do witll the past; it is with the presentand the future that we have to grapple and to deal with. What matters it by what mueanis you have attained your present proud po- sition ? What matters it if some of your opponents had to succulmb throulgh fail or foul Iplay ?

Father Ignatius did not object to these loving caresses, and even reciprocated the endearment by pressing the beau- tiful Hulda to his bosom. Kissing her, he said, with great energy, "No, we must not forget ourselves; we must re- member that I am a priest, and you are a bride wedded to the church." With those words, he disentwined the hands of Sister Hulda, who still clung around his neck, and led her to a chair, took his seat behind his desk, and asked, "What brought youh-ere so suddenly, and why did you give the sign of distress?" Sister Hulda blushed; her cheeks were also flushed with anger, for s'uch a rebuff she had never before experi- enced fribm any man whom she had tried to win through her female blandishments. It required a great effort on her part to appear calm, but she succeeded, and pleasantly said that-she was in haste to tell him how she had secured a position in the house of the La Montes, and how well she was now informde about the past and present history of the family, and their mode of living; she gave the outline of her plan, how she intended to win Mrs. La Monte to the chlrch, and how of her own free will she would lead her to present the church with a share of her great wealth, and in what manner she expected to manage to secure the bulk of the estate of the La Monte family, for the order and the church. Father Ignatius listened attentively, and gave his approv- ing nod and said, "I will assist you to carry out yo1ur llan to secure the wealth of the La MAontes for the benefit of the order and the church. Order of me any aids you wish for assistance, and I will promptly furnish them in the garb of a beggar, a priest, who shall be completely under your direction to carry out so laudable an undertaking.

"Thanks, a thousand thanks for ;our advice and your powerful, sustaining help. I may and may not need it; it is, however, a help already to know that I enjoy your friendship, your confidence, and your good-will. I will al- ways endeavor .to be worthy of it." With these few words, Sister Hulda made a courteous bow, and left the room. Father Ignatius closed the door after her, and --laimed, "Apnge Sata/na, 'get thee behind me, Satan!' :" ,e con- tinued: "For the first time in my life I am complet ,atisfied with myself, for now I feel that I am master of ' tongue and my passions.

Those who cannot master themselves cainnot expect fill that mission, for they are themlselves slaves to their passions, and such slaves cannot be ' Lords.'

He paced the room up and down in rapid strides and in deep meditation. He stolpped and soliloquized : "I will not try to become an archbishop, but a cardinal, and if possible, pope-not a pope who puts half of the world in ban, but a pope who rules the world through the power of a mighty intellect; that makes and unmakes kings, queens, and em- perors; who lifts a nation into a grand prosperity, and who throws a prosperous nation into poverty; and such a pope   OR, OUR DESTINY.        175 will I, Father Ignatius, be." He was interrupted by the hasty appearance of Brother Paulus, who exclaimed,'"Quick, Brother Ignatius! come to the room where the remains of Father Pontifus are; the face is changing to a black and blue color, as if the man died by strangulation." "And what of it?" answered Father Pontifus, " the father died while in an epileptic fit; one of the blood-vessels burst; that causes the effect on the remains. Prepare hiilm for burial, and do not disturb me," giving Brother Paulus a look as if to say, "Beware of insolence!" Brother Paulus understood the meaning of that look, and left meekly. Father Ignatius, left to himself, mused: "Can it be possible that that cigar was so much saturated with ppoison that it killed the father? I must investigate it. I must satisfy myself whether I had anything to do with his death. So far, my hands are free from blood: they shall ever remain so ;" and he took the casket containing the fatal cigars from its hiding-place, and commenced to investigate; but he changed his mind and said, ' This requires more time and reflection than I can now bestow on it. Let me post- pone it to some other time, and see to the burial of Father Pontifus. Let him be buried with all the lionors due to his dignity." Jim, the faithful and reliable servant of Mr. John James La Monte, was almost out of patience, for the horses be- came restless from waiting SO long, and the coachman's tem- per was up, and he said, "That popish-looking woman has more impudence than Mrs. La Monte has, and the Lord knows Mrs. La Monte never takes anybody's feelings into consideration; but even she would not make me wait so long.

"Your race has by its acts historically proved that you are a people full of for- bearance, for when the Southern States were almost pushed to the wall by the Northern armies, you three millions of slaves, full of manly vigor and courage, remained loyal to your masters; -not because those masters deserved it, but your forbearance pronmptedd-it-and will you have less for- bearance toward a lady who let you wait an hour or so longer than she expected?

Sister Hlulda to her husband, who paid no further attention to the matter, and continued to read the evening paper. Sister Hulda repaired to her room and re- ilected deeply on what had happened that day, and con- cluded her reflections with the -remark, llThe money this family possesses must be bequeathed to the church and to our order, and I must keep on a good footing with Father Ignatius, for he is the rising sun on the Catholic firnmamlent, It would not surprise me if he should become His Holiness the Pope.'

Sister Hulda was aware of its power, and decided to avail herself of it. She managed to have the cook and other female servants of the house dis- charged, and replaced through the mystic agency of Father Ignatius. They were excellent servants; the cook. was es- pecially a master in her art.

The house-maids were neat, tidy, and quick with their work, and all seemed happy in their occupation. All looked upon Sister Hulda as a matron worthy not only to be obeyed, but to be almost revered. Mr. and Mrs. La Monte felt very happy in having been so fortunate as to secure the services of such an excellent manager as Sister Hulda proved herself, and treated her with grateful kindness. There was only one unpleasant feature about those excellent servants, from the gardener up to Sister Hulda inclusive : they all insisted on going to church on Sunday to Mass, which greatly discom- moded the family. In order to obviate this, Sister Hulda suggested to Mrs. La Monte to build a chapel on the prem- ises, where not only the family and servants could worship, but also the neighbors, who were devout Catholics. . They would no doubt obtain priest and choir if Mrs. La Monte would build and furnish the chapel or churchl; and Sister Hulda continued with great sincerity, "Once have the church on the premises, and Miss Rosalind would also wor- ship therein, and listen to the sermon of-a Catholic priest, which will make her obey your wish of marriage with the Count. Carl Von Mardeck." "Not one, but two churches would I build and furnish; not my neighbors, but myself ' would procure and pay a priest for the church, if I were sure that Rosalind could be induced to change her mind, give up that shop-keeper, ChaHes Hunting, and marry the Count Carl Von Mardeck," exclaimed Mrs. La Monte with alacrity. "It is worth trying,' responded Sister Hulda readily. "Mr. La Monte would not agree to it. lie does not be- lieve in churches," said Mrs. La Monte tholughtfully. Sister Hulda crossed herself, and prayed that the Lord may forgive Mr. La Monte his sin in thinking so lightly of churches and priests; and she pleaded, "It is your duty to   OR, OUR L)ES'TNY'        179 save him, and you cannot save him without the aid of the church and a priest, who must be within easy reach; for Mr. La Monte, with all due respect to him, loves his comfort too well to go, or even ride, a great distance to church. You must have a church and a priest almost within a few steps. How glad. I am that the thought occurred to me to reconl- mend it to you! How fortunate that you are able to build a church and supply it with a priest and a choir without im- pairing your means in the least!" "Yes; I am able and also willing, but I fear the opposi- tion of my husband. I know he would oppose it, and it would destroy the harmony between us." "( Every sinner is hard to save, but so much greater is the triumph when you succeed. Your husband proposed to pay a visit to Winfred, and to be away six weeks. Encourage him to make that visit and to prolong his stay, and by the time he comes back the church will be ready. It will be a surprise, and I feel sure an agreeable one, for the servants will not then be obliged to go to the city in order to go to church. All the neighbors will avail themselves of it, and worship in your church. It will not only add to the personal comfort of the family and neighbors, but it will spiritually do a great deal of good, and none will be more benefited than Mr. La Monte, whose religious spirit has been greatly neg- lected, and must now be looked after ere it is too late," urged Sisteir Hulda with great devotion. Mrs. La Monte looked surprised, and asked in an excited tone, "Who told you that Mr. La Monte intended to visit Winfred? I am sure that I did not mention it in your presence, and I did not inform you of it. Who did?" "Bridy did. She told me that Mr. .a Monte said he was going to visit Winfred and be gone three or four weeks, and she was afraid to stay if the master of the house was gone. I had hard work to satisfy her that there would be no danger  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7121-00000091"/> ISo      TIlZ FORGIVING sKISS;" at all, even if Mr. La Monte should not be at home, for Warrant will do his duty faithfully." "I do not like Bridy. She invariably lingers in my room to listen to what I and my husband say. You will discharge her and get me another girl," said Mrs. La Monte. "She does not mean anything by it; it may only be a habit of hers. But if you insist on the change, I will try to get another girl." "Do," was the prompt response of the mistress. "It will be necessary to change all the servants of the house, unless you should conclude to act favorably on my suggestion to build a chapel on the premises, and consecrate it to the glory of God, to the glory of the Lord Jesus, who are with us, living or dead-that house in which to prepare to meet death without fear. To be ready for an everlasting life is the duty of the rich and mighty, as well as of the poor and humble. What are wealth and earthly honors compared to the glorious thoughts-we love CGod; we are the meek servants of the Lord Jesus and the Blessed Virgin, for; whose glory we gladly make sacrificesi and thlls prove worthy for this mediation before the throne of grace! What is wealth? What are all the honors compared to a pure soul which re- turns to its Maker laden with the noblest deeds, and accom- panied with the blessings of thousands of human beings who have felt its divine presence? You have it within your power to have your soil expanded within you and gain that grand title, 'a large-souled woman,' whose mission it is to save souls from becoming small-so small and insignificant that they are hardly worth saving. To save souls from utter de- struction, we must have churches within easy reach, and priests to administer the holy sacraments. You, my gra- cious lady, have the means to buiild a church, and even to endow it. Do it, and you will feel blessed. Do it, and you will bless your husband with peace of mind ; for by his   OR', OUR DIETINYF        1S. not going to church to worship God, to worship the Lord Jesus and honor the Blessed Virgin, he worships too much nammon ; and those who worship such a god can never gct enough of him, and are in dread of losing him. Lead him away from the demoralizing thoughts of continually makiln money and keeping it. They who hold to it fast become its slaves instead of its masters. Save him! It is your solemn duty to save him. Save your daughter Rosalind, for she, too, is on the high-road to destruction. Save them! save others who are not so near and so dear to you. Do it, and you will deserve the crown of glory." At these words, Sister Hulda threw herself before Mrs. La Monte, and ex- claimed with great earnestness, "Never did I feel so deep a regret as I now do, that I do not possess more wisdom, more knowledge of the English language, more persuasive cloquence, in order to convince you, my noble lady, that it is your duty to heed my advice to become a servant of the Lord, and, through the means at your command, build a church, remunerate a priest, whose meek example, wlhose words of wisdom, will lead the errinig ones back to the path  of Christian duty, to live a life of enlartged charity and uni- versal love." She withdrew from her bosomr the crucifix, kissed it tenderly, and with bowed head, plrayed : "O O Lord! I feel a lack of wisdom-a lack of eloquence to persuade this, my mistress, born but not arared in the same holy faith. Let her feel a change for the better! I)irect hie thoughts firom earthly vanity to the glories of religious achievements! Let her become an apostle who wields her ability and wealth for Thy glory and the edification of mankind. O Lord! hear and grant my prayer, and may the -oly Virgin and all the blessed saints help me, I implore Thee!" At the last utterance she sobbed and large tears (always at the command of schemingi wolmen) flowed fast down her cheeks. Mrs. La Monte, who was unaccustomed to behold  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7121-00000092"/> I S2     "TIlE FORGIVING KISS;" grief in any form, could not judge whether this prayer and this crying were feigned or from the heart. She was moved, and lifted Sister Hulda affectionately from her prostrate po- sition, dried her tears, and said: "God has indeed directed you to my house to inspire me with religious feelings, and with the conviction that I have a higher duty to perform than to dress tastefilly, and even extravagantly, live sumptuously, and give no attention to re- ligion and to the demands of charity. To my shame must I confess it. But only a' few months ago, a committee colm- posed of eminent manufacturers and merchants, bankers, and divines, called on me to solicit a donation toward a fund to rebuild the burned Bethel building, in which the homeless and naked are temporarily housed and clothed. But I sent them away empty-handed. One of the committee could not well suppress his disappointment, and pleaded resolutely for a donation to, such a laudable cause. 'Madam,' said he, the substance of all wisdom is, so to live and so to manage that peace rules within us, within our families, within our neighbors, within our congregations, within our State and nations anarge. The essence and substance of all religion is to practice charity in the broadest sense: give first to the hungry and naked, and afterward ask whether they were worthy of it. Fifty years hence it will be the same to the estate whether you gave a thousand dollars to such charity, or not; but to you, madam, it will not be the same. If you- give, your memory will live in grateful remembrance, and youtr posterity will be proud of the gift. Permit us to enroll your name among the noble benefactors. The remarks made a deep impression on me ; but having once said no, 1 thought it beneath my dignity to say yes, and begged to be excused. 'The same committee-man had the courage to say, without a moment's hesitation, ' In ancient times Deo- ple were judged not by what they possessed, but by what   OR, OUR DESTINY.        183 they did to alleviate the sufferings of their fellow-men.' I felt the rebuke, and admitted it was a deserving one. You shall have no reason to' complain of me. I will heed your advice: I will build a church to seat one hundred; we will keep it a secret, for the La Monte family were Htiguenots and terribly persecuted by Louis the Fourteenth, of France, which to this day alienates Mr. La Monte from the Roman Catholic Church. But as I will build the church with my own funds, and procure the priest nyself, I am sure my husband should not object." Sister Hulda's face changed as if by magic from extreme grief to extreme joy; she kissed Mrs. La Monte's hands with ecstasy; she kissed the cross with the same exuberance, and exclaimed, "TheLord Jesus and the Holy Virgin be blessed and bless you for such divine resolutions. But no time is td be lost in carrying them out. I have among my effects, sev- eral beautiful drawings of chapels and churches; I will bring them to you,; " and without waiting for an answer she left the room, and quickly returned with a roll of drawings repre- senting several very picturesque designs of chapels and churches. ,                  ! "My dear lady," said Sister Hulda, with all the charnling sweetness at her scommand, "this represents a chu:rch built by the portly Duke Von Schneidach, as a birthday gift to his beautiful andlccomplished duchess ; I think this design will suit you." Mrs. La Monte examined it with great attention, and ex- pressed herself satisfied, but said, "This church has the ap- pearance of being built of cut and dressed stone, which would require much longer time to build the church than can be allowed if it is to be finished in the absence of Mr. La Monte." "I have an idea," observed Sister Hulda, " not to change the appearance of the church. It can be built on iron pillars,  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7121-00000093"/> 184     ' TIIfE FORA GJ /G A'I S';"  the inside to be wainscoted with seasoned walnut, while the  outside to be finis hed with strong galvanized iron accoirding to the drawing, and being painted stone-color it will resem- ble it. True, six weeks is a short timle to build a church, but four weeks before Mr. La Monte starts you can give out the contract; this would give the t mechanics so much time to work ahead, and in that mannerhey can have the church complete before the return of Mr. La Monte. American  mechanics have the reputation of being the most practical  in the world, and will build a castle in as many months as it takes other nationalities years, provided they are sure of payment when the work is done." "We must consult a master builder, to see if your idea is  a practicable one, and whether the church can be built within that time," said Mrs. La Monte, thoughtfully.  "I will request Father Ignatius, who is the secretary of  his Grace the Archbishop, to send yout a trustworthy master builder, for he knows lthem, as many of the churches which were built in this city and the surrounding country were un- der the direction of Father Ignatius ; he can be of great  assistance to us, and he no doubt will, for his heart is for j the noble cause," exclaimed Sister Hulda.  "Yes, he can assist us in the great undertaking. Suppose  you write to him about it, and if he has a capable manl i:l view, let him come here between the hours of ten A. M. and three P. M., when my husband is at the bank,." "I will attend to it at once," remarked Sister Hl-Ila; and  with a graceful bow she left the room, alld on reaching her t apartments wrote the following letter: "DEAR FATHER IGNATIUS:  " I could shout for joy that I have  succeeded in influencig Mrs. John Jn ames 1a Monte to  build a church on her premises fronting the Pike ; the build-   OR, OUR DESTINY.        Is5 ing must be erected in the absence of Mr. La Monte, who is to know nothiig about it. He will leave on a visit to his son in about four weeks, and will be gone six weeks ; within that time the church inust be completely finished. Pray send immediately a master mechanic who enjoys good con- nections, to call at our house, from ten A M. to three P M. to make the contract. He must charge fifty per cent. more than he can afford to build the church for, and agree to pay you the fifty per cent., which is to go to the secret fund of the order. Mrs. La Monte intends to pay the priest of the church out of her funds, but he must be an eloquent man, who is to preach universal charity and univer sal love. Please to select the right man who will impress on the mind of Mrs. La Monte that charity begins at home, and that 'our church' is jealous of the chllrity and love which her children can bestow. I am sure that you will do your best to select a priest for this important post who will possess the power of converting men to the church with such attachments, that for its glory they would sacrifice their dearest posses- sions, and even life itself. "The bearer of this is Bridy, whom the innate acuteness of Mrs. La Monte detected listening to the conversation between her and her husband, and requested me to dis.. charge. I quickly colnplied with her request, as under suspi- cious circumstances she could no longer be of any use to me. Please reward her faithful services by securing to her aged mother, who is an invalid, a light occupation. This will give Bridy a chance to lay up her savings. You may, if you think proper, give her twenty-five dollars besides, and assist her to obtain some good p)lace as a nurse or housemaid. She is able and willing, and can be of service to the order. Please send me at once, another girl to serve as a house- maid (give her instructions). 'But she must be a girl who is quick as a cat and sly as a fox; with the eyes of a lynx, and  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7121-00000094"/> 186     "THrE FORGIVING KISS;" ears of a weasel, for that hateful daughter of the house, Rosa- lind, is now watching me ard the servants with great dili- gence; she is suspecting that we are not as good as we ap- pear. May the Holy Virgin and all the saints assist us! "I close this epistle, and remain your ever obedient ' SISTER HUIDA." Within five minutes Bridy was on her way with the above letter to Father Ignatius, who promDtly executed the order. Mrs. La Monte for the first time in her life felt that she had compromised herself with her husband. It was wrong to build a church without telling him of it beforehand, es- pecially as the religion to which that clihurch was to be ded- icated was not genial to him ; still, she reasoned that she had a right to do with her money what she pleased, and an eloquent priest might succeed in changing Rosalind's inten- tion to marry that young merchant, Charles Hunting, and persuade her to marry the Count Carl Von Mardeck, might have the effect of inducing her husband to become a candi- date as Governor of the State: for with the Catholic vote in his favor, the election was almost a certainty. What are twenty-five or thirty-five thousand dollars that the church might cost, compared to the gratification of having a Count as a son-in-law, -a Couritess for a daughter, and her husband, His Excellency Governor La Monte!  The expectation alone was worth the money. A gentle knock at the door was heard, to which the purse- proud and title-loving woman responded, "Come in." Rosalind entered; she looked pale and even careworn. "Do I disturb you, mother?" "You do not, and I am glad to have you near me!" Without uttering a word, Rosalind stepped to her mother and kissed her with all the sweetness of her loving nature, and wept silently.   OR, OUR DESTINY.        187 ( Unhappy daughter!"exclaimed Mrs. La Monte, 't these are the grave consequences of disobeying your mother. Hlad you obeyed, you would now have been the happy bride of a Count instead of the unhappy maiden who withers like an autumn leaf." "Do not call me alone unhappy, but call the whole fam- ily unhappy. Ever since Sister Hulda came to our house, there has been growing a coldness between you. and father, and as for poor me, I am distastefil to you ; my presence seems at times to be positively irksome. At first I did not know what to make of it, but now all is clear to me, for I fathom the rea- sons why the Archbishop has sent Sister- Hulda to our house. I have analyzed the character of Sister Hulda, and I proclaim her to be a cold-hearted, far-sighted, scheming sycophant, a servile Jesuitess, an adept in all that is wicked; a consummate hypocrite, who, to serve her masters would in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Virgin Mary uproot order and cause dissension between husbands and wives, between parents and  their children, between brothers and sisters, between neigh- bors, communities, and states; destroy peace, prosperity, liberty, property, and life. Nothing is too sacred, nothing is too unlawful for her as a Jesuitess, or a servant of a Jesuit, to do to promote the interest of the society of Jesus. She is a tigress, a hyena, a crocodile, who feels no mercy, who destroys with unrestrained fury thdse whom she cannot gov- ern for the benefit of the Jesuits. Such is Sister Hulda; such is the character of a Jesuitess; such is the woman you have taken in your house, and pressed to your bosom in preference to your loving daughter Rosalind." "The love without the obedience of a child is a mock- ery," replied the mother with disdain. "I have obeyed you in everything but marrying a stran- ger, when I am already betrothed to a worthy young man, a schoolmate, a friend of my youth; with whom I hope to lead  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7121-00000095"/> I88     "TIE FORGVINVG KISS;" a happy wedded life, to be his honored wife, and he my honored husband; whom 1 love and who loves rne ; who are a joy to each other; who will strive to be worthy of God's grace and the respect of our fellow-men-" "That will do, that will dr " interrupted the proud mother. i"With all that you will only be the plain Mrs. Hunt- ing, while if you would obey me and marry the Count Carl Von Mardeck, you would be the Countess Von Mardeck." "Titles have no attraction for me ; what I admnire is to see in a man true virtue, courage, just principles of indus- try, activity, perseverance, charity, mercy, which make of him a firm friend of iilberty and enlightened progress. These qualities my betrothed has, arid with them the plain Charles Hunting is a true nobleman, the highest title a man can have, for that title he has wrought, and not the laws en- acted by man." "This the langutage of my daughlter!" exclaimed Mrs. La Monte peevishy. And she continued'; "Little did I dream, when I nourished you as a babe, that you as a grown maiden would be so much the reverse of all I wished. It seems as if only the plebeian blood of the La Montes flows in your veins, and noneof the noble blood of the Bottwells; you are thus a plebeian by nature, and hence are incapable of appreciating the title of a Baron, a Count, a Lord' a Duke, and therefore disregard the opportunity of marrying one. It is a misfortune of our country to have a governmeunt which has not within its power to bestow titles of nobility to those who are distinguished for their wealth and social losition; but I hope that the time will yet come when our government will be changed, and that it will be vested with the power of bestowing title, and thus draw a distinction between the wealthy and the poor, the enlightened and the ignorant." Rosalind started at these remarks so earnestly uttered, and   OR, OUR DESTINY.        189 exclaimed, " O Heaven! did I hear correctly? My mother despising our republican government, and longing for a monarchy with all its false theories and dazzling pomp? Mother you cannot be in earnest?" "I am," answered Mrs. La Monte promptly. "I have of late changed my opinion in regard to -the form of government and religion. I think and believe that a monarchy' is more beneficial to the different classes than a republic, and the Roman Catholic religion far superior to the Protestant. I hope and pray for a monarchy, and I have concluded to join the Church of Rome: its tenets are more impressive." ' Mother!" gasped Rosalind trembling, " you will not bring that shame on your kind husband, my noble father, on your devoted son and daughters; you will notgive up your hereditary faith for a faith which dictates complete sub- mission to the pretension of the Holy See, the authority of tradition, purgatory, transubstantiatipn, the sacrifice of the mass, confession, penance, extreme unction, the invocation of saints, aind kneeling before wooden gods--all of'which en- slave the mind with trembling fear, and as a consedquence make men slaves of crafty priests, who, under the pretense of saving your soul froml utter destruction, will rule you for , their own selfish ends. For God's sake, for your own sake, for the sake of your family, and for the sake of public opinion, do not take such a step, which will prove fatal to the dearest interests you have on earth and. in heaven." With these words, Rosalind thrrew herself before her mother, and contin- ued beseechingly: "' Do not adhere to that fatal resolution ; re- consider it, and remain a Protestant. Emancipate your mind from dogmas, and endeavor step by step to pray to God your- self without the aid of priests and trinkets, which slowly but surely triumphs over prejudices, and teaches that all men are of one comnmon brothlerhood, who have God as their father who is just, who is mlieciful, who is benignant, who will pro-  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7121-00000096"/> Ig90     "TH FOR GIVING KASS;" tect us while we live on earth and mete out our rewards in heaven." Your appeal is useless; my resolution to become a  Catholic is firm ; it is the true faith; it is the only religion which makes a distinction between classes, which unerringly and punctiliously assigns the proper position to those who ounght to govern and those who are to be governed. The power and the great adherence that the Roman Catholic faith everywhere acquires show that it is under direct divine pro- tection. A hundred years hence it will be the religion of the whole world." "It seems that I not only hear the voice of my mother, but the language of Sister Hulda, who has so often preached those doctrines to you, that you repeat them parrot-like. Pardon me for these words," exclaimed Rosalind sorrowfully, "but I am distressed. I am angry that iat e has sent that Jesuit woman to our house; she is doing her best to make an apos- tate of my mother; use you and your wealth to advance  deep-laid schemes for the aggrandizement of ihe Catholic clergy. Religion with them is a secondary consideration. If they taught the Catholic principles in their primitive state, mankind would have been spared to record deeds of cruelty which make men blush with shame, and which even now in our enlightened age would be continued, were it not checked by the master minds of other creeds. Look at Italy; lool at Spain; look at France and Mexico, where the Catholic clergy rule. Their thirst for gain and their thirst for vengeance convulse those countries with agony, hinder the process of education for the masses, paralyze trade and industry, thus cloud the faces with anxiety, and depress the hearts of millions. The rich have become poor, and the poor poorer;  and this sad fate you would have the heart to encourage and inauguralte in our glorious country.

"It is a base calumny!" exclaiimed Mrs. La Monte in an angry voice. "If the utterance of truth can be called a calumny, then it is, for my remarks are not based on imaginative but historical facts, which also daily transpire in our very midst. The Catholic clergy is an army of disciplined soldiers, who blindly obey and are well officered. The Pope is the emperor; the cardinals are the generals, the archbishops the colonels; the bishop the lieutenant-colonel, and so down to Hulda, who serves as a spy for the grand army; and in her humble position performs valuable service. You and thousands like you are valuable acquisitions to the great mass which is to be gov- erned for their selfish purpose. Mother, -pray be on your guard; pause and reason on what I have said, and you will abandon your intentions." "I will pause and reason on what you have said, if you pause and reason on my advice to become the bride of Count Carl Von Mardeck and--" "I will, I will," interrupted Rosalind energetically. "To save you from becoming a Roman Catholic, and an apostate, I would sacrifice my life." Sister Hulda suddenly entered the room, her face flushed with excitement. She evidently had listened to the animat-ed conversation between mother and daughter. Rosalind, ob- serving her and her sudden entrance, thought so, and angrily asked, "You are again intruding when I am engaged in con- versation with my mother: leave this room instantly, you eavesdropper!" "Your accusation is false! I have not been listening to  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7121-00000097"/> 192     "TIZE FORAGIVING IASS;"  your conversation. I will not leave this room at your comr- nand; I only obey the orders of Madam La Monte, and not a silly, insolent miss." Rosalind grew deadly pale, her eyes flashed fire, but she  quickly recovered her composure, and calmly said, "' What other language can one expect froml a sycophant who has wormed heiself into the good graces of my too confiding mother. I confess that I have been too hasty to order you out of the room, and thus give you an opportunity to insult and quarrel with me. I will not take anl insult from such a source; you are too far beneath me! you are a spy! you  came to this house for a base purpose. I aml in your way. You aim to drive me out of the house, in 'which, however, you will not succeed. I will not order you out of this room, but I hope to see the day when my good mother will order you out of the house. I w*ill then remind you of your remarks- 'I only obey the orders of Madam La Monte.'"With these  words, Rosalind left the room.  On reaching her apartment, she fell on her knees, clasped her hanl s, and with uplifted head and eyes she prayed;l 0 God! 'hou my Heavenly Fathcr, whose beni-gnant kindness  protect every -worm that creeps in the dust, every creature that exists in streams and oceans, every animal that roams on } the face of the earth ; who sweetens the water-springs, wlho  fattens the land, and Dmoistens with dews in the season every blade of grass, every leaf ill this wide universe ; who also pre- pares minerals for the iuse of man : protect me whom Thou  I hast blessed with reason, to complrehend Thy parental good- ness; Thou hast planted in my heart a longing to give thanks  to Thee for the unaccountable blessings which Thy ilmmeas- urable grace bestows on man, for whose happiness Thou hast created this beautiful world, which in the smallest part there- of bears the imprel-s of Thy incomprehensible wisdom, love, tand j ustice.

On Thy merciful arm I lean ; I trust Thou wilt not forsake me, and those whom I love; Thou Great Spirit who hast formed the heart of man, who knowest its innermost secrets, its emotions, inspire them with Thy love, with Thy justice, and with Thy boundless mercy, that there should be less perversion and oppression between man and man. Banish ignorance and wretchedness froml Thy children, that they may live in- telligently and pleasantly on Thy earthly paradise, and be worthy, when' their pilgrimage here is at an end, to enter the heavenly regions which lead to the throne of eternal grace." Refreshed, the noble maiden rose from her supplication, paused, and considered what course to pursue in order to rescue her mother from the fatal machinations that sur- rounded her. I must not," said she, " apprise my father of it, for it might excite him to such an extent as to endanger his life by the violent palpitation of the heart that he is subject to. -If he is to be informed of it, it nmust be done by a third  party, who must in a playful manner point out to him the true character of Sister Hlulda. Who can that third party be? None other but the Count Carl Von Mardeck, whose visits to our house I must henceforth encourage. But what will my beloved Charles Hunting do when he hears of the frequent' visits of the Count to our house? Will it not irri- 'tate him so much that he will again begin to lead a wild life?"At that thought a heavy sigh escaped her oppressed breast; she again paused and. reasoned, and in a few mo- ments a joyful gleam illumtinated her angelic features, and she exclaimed happily, "To Winfred I will write the full pariticulars ; request him -to come home immediately; he can see dear darling Charles, explain to him why the Count Carl 9  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7121-00000098"/> I94     "TIlE FORGIVING KISS;" Von Mardeck visits our house, and with our combined efforts we will drive that Jesuitical woman away. Thank God that I have a brother, and that brother so affectionate, dutiful, and brave!" With these words yet on her lips, the young lady took paper, pen, and ink, and wrote a clear and com- prehensive letter to her brother Winfred, closing it with an urgent request not to delay a rnoment, but to come home at once. After sealing and directing the letter, she was on the point of ringing the bell for Jim to take it to the post-office, but thinking that he might also be under the influence of Sister Hulda, and might give her the letter, and thus her plans might miscarry, she resolved to take the letter herself. She quickly dressed in her riding-habit, and rang the bell for Jim. Jim, please saddle my horse quickly." ' Miss Rosalind, it almost breaks my heart to let you know that I have just received instructions from your mother not to obey any of your orders, and to report to her anything that you say or do. I cannot obey your order without endangering the loss of my situation, which would be to you even a greater blow than my disobedience, for you can rely on my fidelity, while if another coachman comes in my place you could not. I will not report to the mistress what you say or do; for I need not hear what you say, nor need I see what you do. You are wise, and you will excuse and comprehend me." Rosalind was thunder-struck, but her usual presence of mind did not forsake her, and she playfully remarked, "Jim, this is not true; you are jesting." "The gloom on my face and the tears that are gathering  in my eyes prove that it is only too true." And maiy I rely upon your loyalty, that neither money nor flattery will induce you to prove false?"   . "I swear bly the saintly ashes of President Lincoln, who !4   7R, OUR DESTINY.        195 made me a free man, that I will remain your faithful ser- vant. I cannot obey your orders openly, but will do so secretly." "Thanks, thanks," repeated Rosalind, gratefully. "Sad- dle my horse, leave him in the stable; keep yourself busy within sight of Sister Hulda and my mother, so that they cannot accuse you of having assisted me." Footsteps were heard, and Rosalind quickly opened the door, and loudly said: "'Jim, have those flowers cut and tied in three bunches; I wish them placed on the supper- table." "I will first see Mrs. La Monte, whether she allows it, for I am henceforth tnly to obey her orders; Miss Rosalind has nothing to say." Rosalind slammed and bolted the door, thinking, "My mother has not paused and reasoned, or Jim would not have received such orders." Tears, those messengers of relief, rolled down her pale cheeks. Changing her riding-habit, she kept herself busy about the house until night set in, when she mounted her horse, rode to the city, mailed the precious letter, and returned home unobserved. The night passed, and the morning sun rose in its maj- esty. The birds sang their sweetest melodies, giving thanks to the Author of the universe for the cheering, invigorating sun which so grandly illuminates His handiwork. It required the morning rays, the sweetness of the atmosphere, and the melodies of the feathered songsters to cheer up the spirit of the noble Rosalind. Catastrophe threatened the peace of the family. Viola's marriage to Otto Wehlen was distasteful to Mrs. La Monte, and she so expressed herself to her con- fidante, Sister Hulda, who fanned that dislike into hate. The letters which Viola sent home fromn her bridal tour were not of the happiest tone ; her husband had so many corrections to make in regard to her love of extravagant dress, etc., and  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7121-00000099"/> I96     "THE FORGIVING KICSS;" she had hard work to please him, although he convinced hei that he was right, but she never had to learn so many things as now, that it made her not so happy as she ex- pected to be; and were it not that she loved Otto she would hasten home. The last letter received was even more de- sponding ; Otto would not permit a correspondent of the Z/IuepJleden/t Aiorning Journal to lescribe in his letter her elegant dresses which she wore at theopera and in which she received calls. This was more than she could bear; such cruelty made her married life burdensome; she wished she had never married Otto, although loving and very atten- tive, which endeared him to her, " but he is so exacting," she said-" so resolved to make me dlo what he thinks is right and proper, and will not recede one iota from a reso- lution once formed." It would have pleased her so highly if her many costly and artistic dresses had been artistically described by that able correspondent, and her many'friends of her native city would have seen it all in the IAlc3endcnt ilorning Journal, which almost everybody reads; but cruel Otto would not gratify her, and insisted that her vanity must be checked, and almost showed the obliging corre- spondent the door, who called expressly at the hotel to see the splendid dresses which were so much admired and envied. This letter was read by Sister Hulda at the morning meal, and she laid great stress upon the words "cruel Otto,"' which made Mrs. La Monte regret that her beautiful Viola was married to such a brute of a man, and exclaimed, "I will see to this; Viola shall not wither under his oppres- sion. Happily the maxim, '-What God has joined no man shall put asunder,' has lost its force in our country, and an able lawyer will have no trouble in making a good case and obtaining a divorce for my poor Viola." "Just so, just so," joined Sister Hulda in an encouraging   OR, OUR DESTINY.        197 tone ; "the son of the former housekeeper ought to bend his knees before the datghter of this princely house, even if he is her Lhusband; he ought to idolize her, and not find fault, and use his authority as a husband to prevent his wife's wardrobe being described in public print. It is cruel to de- prive his wife of such innocent pleasure ;" and Sister Hulda rattled away in the same strain, lowering Otto Wehlen in the estimation of Mrs. La Monte, and impressing on her mind the necessity of having her daughter Viola divorced froml her husband. Rosalind listened to this base counsel, but made no remark, for she reasoned that Sister Hulda felt herself stronger in her position than before, and she only made these remarks in her presence to arouse her anger and again humiliate her before her mother. "Better wait until Otto and Winfred were at home: then will be the time to speak and act." As the day advanced, strange visitors made their appear- ance at the house, and were closeted with Mrs. La Monte and Sister Hulda. Rosalind wondered at the strange pro- ceedings; no one was permitted to enter the room when the whispering became the mode of conversation in the house. At each succeeding day new visitors called and paid their respects to Mrs. La Monte with a language as if she were the empress of a great empire. All seemed to take special pains to please and flatter her. Rosalind was not permitted to partake in the receptions, and was not only coldly but harshy treated by her mother. "What does all this mean?' soliloquized the unhappy young lady ; " where will all this end?"That there was a grand plot laid to entrap her mother to the church of Rome, and therewith secure to that church her great wealth, was finally fixed in her mind. But who laid out that plot? and who directed it? Those were the great questions over which she pondered. While her thoughts were thus occupied, she heard Sister Hulda joyfully exclaim:  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7121-00000100"/> I98     "77HE FORGIVING KISS;" "My good lady, even his Grace the Archbishop is coime to congratulate you; prepare to receive his Reverence." Rosalind looked from her window, and observed an elderly gentleman of dignified mien briskly step from his elegant equipage, adjust his cravat, and wend his way toward the  grand entrance of the house. "Yes, that is the Arch- bishop; I have seen his portrait for sale in some of the book-stores. And while he is paying his respects to my mother, perhaps even preparing to make arrangements pub- licly to receive her in the church of Rome, I will avail my- self of the opportunity to visit my friend Mrs. Wehlen, there to pour out my suppressed feelings, and with her take coun- sel of what is best to be done to save my poor mother from { the skilful meshes that surround her." With these words on her lips, Rosalind dressed in her walking costume, left the house unobserved, took an omnibus, and reached Rox Street, where Mrs. Wehlen had just finished furnishing her new house. The friends embraced and kissed; both wept for joy at being again together. Mrs. Wehlen exclaimed: "If you were an angel from heaven and had visited me, I could not have been made more happy than I am by your visit; you can form no idea how I longed to see you, to talk to you, to cheer you up, and to advise with you on what is best to be done, for I know all that is going on in your father's house." You dlo " exclaimed Rosalind, greatly surprised. "Yes, I do." How so?" "Jim is my trustful messenger. You are aware that I have taught Jim to read and write, and have induced him ,to cease to swear, to chew, to smoke, to drink, and to save his money. Ever since then he has been very grateful to me. He called on me several times since I left your home, and told me what kind of a woman Sister Hulda is, and I con-   OR, OUR0 DES7TIN.       199 eluded at once that she was a Jesuitess, who will need close watching-and Jim is watching her; hle is acting faithfully un- der my instructions. Are you aware that your mother is contemplating building a Roman Catholic Church on the premises?" 'No, I am not," answered Rosalind, with great astonish- ment. Yes, your mother has already signed the contract. The church is to be put up while your ,father visits Winfred, and Mr. La Monte is to be pacified, when he returns and sees the edifice, by being promised the Catholic vote for Gover- nor of the State, provided he will acquiesce good-naturedly in the step that Mrs. La Monte has taken of joining the Roman Catholic Church, in which she will be an ostensible leader, but a mere slave with her purse to Iriestcraft." "You astonish me!" exclaimed Rosalind, wringing her hands in distress. "This is the scheme, and it is pursued with all the energy that characterizes the order of the Jesuits." A happy smile lighted up) the features of Rosalind, and she exclaimed, "But my father will have no occasion to visit Winfred, for I wrote to Winfred to tell him what danger .besets our house, and bade him come home imme- diately; I expect him every day." "Did you? And with whom did you send the letter to the post-office?" "I myself rode at night to the city, and dropped it in the letter-box." "W ise, very wise," answered Mrs. Wehlen. Rosalind related what letters Viola had sent home, the effect they had upon her mother, and that she actually contemplated a divorce between Viola and her husband. Mrs. Wehlen listened and sadly bowed her head, and said: "Would to God that old Mr. Bottwell had left a smaller  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7121-00000101"/> 200     "THE FOt RGIlVING KIZ"SS;" estate to his child, and more sense of duty, morie practical knowledge. How much better it would now have been for the whole family. But old Mr. Bottwell paid little or no attention to the proper enlightenment of his child ; he kept on piling up money, set the example to his wife and child that to get very rich is the highest duty, to be very rich the greatest pleasure, and to associate with any one who is not as rich, beneath one's dignity. All this is bearing the fruit of discontent and discord, of which the 'buzzards' of society will take advantage and ruin her and bring misfortune on the family. But what most distresses me is that your father, who is a self-made man, walks in the footsteps of your grandfather Bottwell. A few days ago I caEled at the bank, wishing to speak to him about Sister Hulda and her intentions, but he was looking on what is called the telegraphic stock indicator, exclaiming, ' Western Union Telegraph is again advancing, Lake Shore is recovering, Express stocks growing stronger-the whole market is firmer. I breathe more freely,' rubbing his hands with delight. I addressed him : Mr. ILa Monte-' but at this moment the indicator again said ' tick, tick, tick,' and Mr. La Monte hastened to it; his face grew gloomy, and he mut- tered, 'The market is off again. What Western Union three points lower? Good God! what is up?' He nervously rang the bell. The head clerk reslonded to the call, and received his imperative instructions : ' Call in at once all the call loans; there is a panic brewing in Wall Street, and we cannot lell where it will end.' ' But,' expostulated the head clerk, ' by calling in the loans our manufacturers and merchants will be greatly embarrassed, and the working classes greatly suffer by it.' 'That is none of our fineral,' was the harsh response. It froze the blood in my veins when I heard it, for I thought of the hundreds of families that would suffer through meas- ures which would deprive heads of establishments of capital to prosecute their labors. The impression that your father   OR, OUR DESTINY.        201 made on'me that day was that he no longer belonged to himself; the buying and selling of stocks makes him love money more than anything else. I approached him again and tried to converse with him, but he said, ' Mrs. Wehlen, I have not the time now to speak to you.' "'When shall I come again, for I have matters of great importance to speak to you of?' I asked. "'Is it about finance?' was his question. 'If it is not about finance I have no time: I am always busy.' "I left the bank disJheartened, and could not muster cour- age to call and see your father again," concluded Mrs. Weh- len. "I notice a great change in my father: he is continually thinking of finance; nothing else interests him except the cultivation of flowers, to which I have turned his attention, and even that he is now neglecting." "Making money and making it in large amounts is evi- dently occupying his attention ; every thing else-religion, wife, children, relatives, and the State-are with him a sec- ondary consideration. Where will this end?" "Money-making at the sacrifice of the proper performance of the higher duties of life is a fatal delusion," said Rosalind sadly. "Let us not despair; let us draw with a confiding heart nearer to God, and have faith in His grace, in His help. In the hour of need He will give us health, wisdom, and en- ergy, and send assistance in due time." A knock was heard at the door, and Mrs. Wehlen opened it and received a letter from the carrier. She broke the seal and read aloud: "MY DEAR MOTHER: "At last Viola has consented to turn homeward. I am tired of this bridal tour, and long to be at home, snugly settled in my house. We may stop a day or 9*  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7121-00000102"/> 202     "I    c(GIVINGV AISS;"  two at Niagara Falls. Expect us anon. I hope these lines  will find you in good health, and I remain "Your loving son, "OTO WEHLEN." Both friends rejoiced at the good news. While Rosalind spent a few hours at Mrs. Wehlen's, Sister Hulda was in her room elated at her'great success. She felt that-she was complete master of the situation. With Mrs. La Monte her word was law, and with Mrs. La Monte on her side she was mistress of the house. But only one thing disturbed her-the silence of Rosalind, and the cold contempt with which that young lady treated her. "If there was opposi- tion to be expected," thought she, "it will come from Rosa- lind; that shrewd girl is even now preparing an opposition which will be overwhelming, and before she can' carry out  her project she must be disposed of either by fair or foul play.  To break her heart would be a triumph over which I would  4 greatly rejoice. Let me manage for Count Carl Von Mar- deck to invite her to a ride and get. her past the house of Charles Hunting, sothiat he will see her publicly riding at the side of the young Count; his jealousy will break his resolu- tion not to drink and carouse, and after she has fully con- cluded to marry the Count, let him be recalled by his gov- ernment; but, alas our church has very little influence at the court of Berlin; that hateful Bismarck with his Jewish secretaries is too wide awake for us. There is a shorter road to all this," exclaimed she with a curled lip, gazing intently  on the snake-like ring on her finger. "But no, let this be  the last resort; let me bear in mind the advice of Father Ig- natius to avoid violence." Mrs. La Monte entered the room and actually kissed Sister Hulda, saying, "I cannot express to you how happy I feel; the visit of his Grace the Archbishop has invigorated me with   OR, OUR DES7AY.        203 new life. Never did I listen to such comprehensive arguments in behalf of our duty to be religious and use every means to convert others to lead a religious life. I felt that one of the apostles of old was in my presence doing his best to save me from an inglorious life; and when he left me his Grace affec- tionately pressed my hand and expressed a hope that I would become a shining light of the true church, an earnest apostle, whose self-sacrificing example would bring hundreds of mis- guided heretics, and perhaps even Jews, into the fold of the church. I implored his guidance, his blessing, and the blessing of his Holiness the Infallible Pope." "And what did his Grace say to this?" asked Sister Hulda eagerly. "Tears of joy gathered in his eyes; he waved his hand affectionately, bade me adieu, and I felt that a true friend had departed." The loud and joyful barking of Warrant attracted the at- tention of Sister Hulda and her mistress. Both looked out, and Mrs. La Monte exclaimed, with profound astonishment, "Why, it is my son Winfred! his horse foaming and cov- ered with dust. He must have ridden post-haste. I wonder why he came so unexpectedly." Winfred gave a whistle which made the hills re-echo, and called out, "Jim, Jim! quick, take my horse and give him a good rubbing; cool him off gradually; attend to him. Wait, let ine take my pistols from the holster." Jim looked amazed at his young master, who had altered wonderfully since he left home His face was sunburnt and weather-beaten, his form strong and muscular, his step quick and firm, his mien dignified, and his voice and look command- ing ; he was the very picture of health and self-reliance. lie was one of those youths who have studied with a fixed pur- pose to-become a useful member of society, and who, as the State geologist, put his knowledge to a practical use. lie  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7121-00000103"/> 204     "THE FOR GIVING KIfSS; ' was not one of those youths who study, leave the school with high honors, aind there end their career; who hide t'eir lazi- ness under the folds of the dress of a doting mother or a ca- ressing sister, who are continually concerned and in agonizing fear that the son or brother will hurt himself with his studies or embark in the wrong profession, or what is worse, that the young student is courting young ladies and is weak enough to believe that they are all in love with him, and which grad- ually monopolizes his thoughts, that weakens his mind, and which unnerves him for a fixed occupation. And thus many a promising young man fades away to nonentity. He becomes a curse to himself, a burden to his parents, a stum- bling-block to his sisters and brothers, a reproach to his rela- tives, a drone on society. He is in his own way, and therefore in the way of everybody else. All point their hands at him to pass on, and on he passes, like a fleeting shadow, to his grave, not to be missed and therefore quickly forgotten. Wififred had acquired every good. habit, hence he was blooming, with health, and felt within himself strength to conquer all obstacles. On entering the room, his mother kissed him. The son felt it was a cold kiss-a kiss which was not given with all the heart. ";What brought you home so suddenly? and how sun- burnt and weather-beaten you look!" exclaimed the mother' in a reproachful tone. "I had a presentiment that some danger besets my father's house, and hastened home with all the speed that a good horse could lend. As for my complexion, the delicate tint has been sacrificed on the altar of useful activity." "A presentiment of danger!" exclaimed Sister Hulda looking at Mrs. Ia Monte. '"My son, this is Sister Hulda." Winfred coldly bowed, and said, "I was not aware that you had a sister."   OR, QUR DESTINY.        205 "Of course I have no sister; this lady is called Sister Hulda because she belonged to a sisterhood in her native Germany, and still retains the title of sister ; and in her po- sition with me she is like a sister, a confidante." "Clever, very clever of Sister Hulda, who in such a short time has made herself so agreeablethat she takes the posi- tion of a sister in your affections, and is your confidante. I always thought that a mother found in her grown daughter the lost sister, and that only a husband is the confidante of a wife; but I see that in this instance I am mistaken." "How explicit you have become in your' views, and in your mode of expression- And pistols you carry too?" "I have learned to be explicit in thought and language, and pistols I have to carry for my safety, when exploring the wild regions-in my geological survey, where one is liable to encounter a bear, a wolf, a lynx, or a reptile. I have be- come a dead shot. You see, mother "--and at the same time  the young man looked at Sister -Hulda-" you see, mother," he repeated, "in yonder tree, which my noble father planted in honor of my birthday, you see on the twig to the right is on one of the' leaves a caterpillar slowly creeping to despoil that beautiful tree; tlmt very caterpillar my bullet shall shatter into a thousand atoms." He took the pistol, aimed, and blew away' the leaf on which the caterpillar crawled. Sister Hulda, pale and trembling with fear, crossed her- self rapidly, and exclaimed, "The Holy Virgin have mercy!" "And God has mercy on those who unintentionally sin, but on those who wilfully-sin I doubt whether they are so mercifilly treated," said Winfred with suppressed anger, which Sister Hulda qcickly noticed. "Retire to your room, and take your pistols with you keep them out of the reach of any one'," said the mother. "He had better unload those shooting-irons ; a loaded pis-  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7121-00000104"/> 206     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" tol is a murderous weapon, and ought not to be tolerated in the house," remarked Sister Hulda with great earnestness. "Yes, you had better unload them," pleaded the mother. u' I will take care of them ; they will harm no one, unless they deserve 'to be harmed," observed Winfred, throwing a side glance at Sister Hulda, who looked sharply at the pistols as Winfred took hold of them. "But where is Rosalind, and what news have you from Viola?" "Rosalind is in her room, and Viola, poor Viola, she is to be pitied, for she is married to a cruel man." "Otto Wehlen a cruel man? It is hardly possible that a man of hiI intelligence and refinement shouldbe cruel, and  especially cruel to his wife. In what does his cruelty con- sist?" exclaimed Win fred. "Think of it: the hard-hearted man would not even allow a correspondent to describe her elegant outfit in one of his letters to our Arf opolitan Jourinal, and thus a golden oppor- tunity was wasted for their friends and all the fashionable  world to know what super-elegant dresses, costly trim- mlings, and rare jewels she possessed. I can imagine how bitterly she wept. If I had been present, would I 'not have given it to that plebeiana! He is not worthy to have her, and he shall not keeD her." "Mother, I think that Otto is right not to have his wife's clothes paraded in the newspaper; it encourages vanity, which every good husband ought to suppress." "So you too take Otto's part? You are as unnatural a son as Rosalind is an unnatural daughter. Leave my pres- ence!"  Winfred bowed with great humility, and left the room.  "You have acted rightly to order your son from your presence; he is insolent and sliritually lost; he has grownl too old for you to train him proerly ; lie requires a stronger  nature and a firmer hand to lead him on the right path; the -    OR, OUR DESTINY.        207 less you come in contact with him, the better it will be for your health and spirit; use your influence to make him leave the house with as little delay as possible, for a young man that can shoot as well as he does is not a pleasant companion," pleaded Sister Hulda. "I do not like Winfred, he is too democratic and too independent. Mrs. Wehlen, who had Rosalind and Winfred under her special charge, made them what they are. Viola I took care of, and she is a child after my heart; and even she was' captivated by the beautiful exterior of that hateful Otto Wehlen. Oh! I wish that you instead 6f Mrs. Weh- len could have come to my house; how different would have been the education of my children!" "They would have reasoned less, but obeyed -better, I can assure you; still it is not yet t6o late; command theml to obey me, and vest me with the power of acting as if I were their mother, and you will soon notice a change for the bet- ter. As educators of youth we have no equal." "Whom do you mean by we?" "I mean the Sisters," answered Sister Hulda unhesitat- ingly. If she had said the Jesuits, she would have expressed her full meaning. The Count Carl Von Mardeck was announced. "Show him into the reception-room, open the piano, and tell him to amuse himself until we come." Turning to Sister Hulda, Mrs. La- Monte said, "The Count could not have arrived at a more inappropriate timle; but a mother who wishes to marry her daughter to the right man must put herself to great inconveniences." "Poor lady, you have your trials," said Sister Hulda with great sympathy. Winfied on reaching his room rang the bell; the maid answered it.  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7121-00000105"/> 208     "fT/IE FORGIVING KISS'; " "Please tell the cook to prepare a dincer for me; some roasi-beef, a few potatoes, and a cup of tea will do." "Dinner has been served already, and the cook will pre- pare no dinner, unless..the order is given by Sister Hulda," answered the maid with poQitiveness. "Please tell Jim to come up." "I have not been hired for that purpose. If you want Jim, call him yourself," was the dry rejoinder. "You are a charming girl; you will .do, and will do still better by being gone. Don't be on the point of going, but hegone." Winfred rang the bell twice; a sign for Jim, but Jim did not answer. He rang again and again. At last the old ser- vant came up, and said, "At yout service, sir." "It took you a long time to lmake your appearance." Jim made no answer, but bowed his head sadly. "Jim, there is going to be a general clearing out of the present servants from this house, commencing with Sister Hulda; you will be retained, but I expect prompt obedience. Here is a dollar; get one pound of dry beef cut in thin slices, a loaf of rye bread, and a pitcher of water; be quick, for I am hungry; but before -you go, tell me where Rosalind is, and who is playing on the piano." ' iiss Rosalind has just come hoe; she is delighted that you are arrived. The Count Carl Von Mardeck is playing.". Rosalind rushed into the room, joyfully kissed her brother, requested him to dress and come down into the reception- room as quickly as possible, and invite the whole party to take a ride, which would give them a better chance of ex- changing views. "For in our house we are surrounded by Jesuit spies," said she sadly. "I understand. I am of course at your entire service," answered Winfred earnestly.   OR, OUR DESTINY.        209 Left to himself, he thought, "What my father's house now suffers, the whole nation will soon' suffer, under the domi- neering power of the Jesuits, who will deprive it of union, of liberty, and prosperity, as soon as they feel ntrong enough. It is gathering strength; it must be met before it gets too powerful." "Jim, I am glad you came; dinner comes slowly when a man is hungry. When Mrs. Wehlen was in our house, it was not necessary for me to take such a dinner. But so it is in places where the Jesuits rule the people dine on crumbs, and the Jesuits on the fat of the land. There is a wide difference between Mrs. Wehlen and Sister Hulda; Mrs. Wehlen is a Christian at heart, and Sister Hulda is a Christian only with her tongue." "That is true; the one has reached the very threshold of divinity, and the other the very verge ofinfamy." Mrs. La Monte, Rosalind, and Winfied soon repaired to the reception rootl, where Winfired was cordially introduced to Count Von Mardeck, and after they conversed, played, and sang, they resolved to take a ride on horsback. Sister Hulda noticed their departure, and exclaimed with unbridled rage, "God is my witness, never did I hate any human being so intensely as I do that girl Rosalind. It is she who has ordered her brother to come .home it is she who will counteract all my plans; she is the only obstacle in my way." She withdrew the cross from her bosom, and said with a sinister intensity, "I swear it by the cross that I will make of her a bedridden decrepit, or a corpse " She rang the bell with great energy; the maid quickly answered, and With head bent was ready to receive her orders. "Tell me, Mary Ann, what was Rosalind doing, and what did the young man who arrived to-day say to you, and did Rosalind speak to him? give me full particulars." "Rosalind left the house, dressed in her shopping suit,  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7121-00000106"/> 210     ' TIRE FORGIVING KISS; " and was not in the house whe'n the young man arrived. After the young man left his mnother, he rang the bell. I answered the call. He requested me to tell the cook to prepare a dinner for him; I answered that dinner had been served, and the cook wouM not prepare anything, unless the order is given by Sister Hulda." "And what did he say?" "'Please tell Jim to come up.'  "And you obeyed?" asked Sister Hulda, her eyes flashing fire. "I know better than that; I told him that I was not hired for that purpose. If he wanted Jim, to call himi himself." "' Bravo I bravo! and what did he say?" "He said that I was a charming girl; that I would do, and would do still better being gone. ' Don't be on the point of going, but begone,' said he." "And what did you do?" "I left the room as quickly as I could, for there was a look in his eye as if he would take hold of me and throw me out of the window." "Did he swear and appear angry?" "No, he did not; he was cool and collected. He appeared to me like one who is used to command, and who has the power within him to have his orders executed." "And how about Jimn-did he call him?" "Yes, he rang the bell several times, and Jim answered the call, and he sent him to buy some smoked beef and bread." "When Rosalind returned, did she greet her brother?" Yes, she did, but she stayed in his room only a few mo- mlents." "Watch the brother and sister to see what they do ; listen to their conversation; be careful not to be observed;" and waving her hand she dismissed her subordinate.   OR, QUR DESTINVY.       2" "1 have reasoned correctly," soliloquized she, "Rosalind has by letter informed her brother of my intentions; that is the reason that they conversed a few moments together. That young man despises me ; that explains his glance when shooting at the caterpillar; that explains why he did not ask me to order a dinner for him. He is self-possessed, but will he remain s o when, misfortune lays its hand heavily on him? Some young men possess a bold front as long as everything goes well with them and those they love ; but the moment some misfortune befalls them or their friends, they are forever undone. I must devise some catastrophe for this family which will dishearten them, and make them pious, and look to me to guide them to the fountain where balm for their wounds may be found." A letter-carrier brought a letter addressed to Mrs. La Monte, which the maid promptly delivered to Sister Hulda, who carefully and with a practised hand opened it and read: "rY DEAR MOTHER: "Otto will not gratify my wish to visit Quebec, that Gibraltar of America. I have therefore to abandon the anticipated pleasure of seeing that a)cient city, and it is the samle with Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto.

With these words, Sister -Hulda crossed herself, bolted the door, and sank into the near-  est chair, lost in deep meditation. Mrs. La Monte felt buoyant and proud as she rode by the  side of Count Von Mardeck, for Rosalind managed to ride ahead with her brother Winfred. She related to him the fiull particulars about Sister Hulda, and gave her viewsfreely, explaining what she thought Sister Hulda aimed at. Although Winfied flluy agreed that Rosalind was correct in her views, yet he thought it was hardly possible that Sister Hulda should consider his father and mother so foolish as to be thus entrapped and governed. "You see how she has succeeded in becoming the mis- tress of our house. The servants are her creatures ; we can- not do anything of which she is not minutely informed, and gradually we must do as she pleases. She completely con- trols mother, and has a great influence over father; for you know father loves his ease and comfort, and this he now en- joys to a degree which he never enjoyed before. I never saw such servants as we now have: they do their work   OR, OUR DESTINY.        213 quietly, and in splendid style. A look froim Sister Hulda makes them tremble with fear of a dismissal. The eatables could not be better prepared than they are, and are served magnificently; this pleases father, and he has often said that he would rather lose the best clerk in his bank than Sister Hulda. She is an angel in her manner, and a capital housekeeper; Mrs. Wehlen is nowhere compared with her. Besides all this, Sister Hulda has hinted that she has great influence with the heads of her church, who could be pre- vailed upon to ust their immense influence to secure the Catholic vote for father as Governor of the State, and she says his Grape the Archbishop has more money on deposit by his flock than he knows what to do with, which he might be induced to place in father's bank on very favorable terms. Father is of late very ambitious and greedy; to satisfy both, he might in a weak moment form an alliance with the Cath- olic Church." "Never, never!" exclaimed Winfred with great energy. "Father may not, if promptly appealed to ; but mother, I am almost sure, has determined to join the Catholic Church, and nothing will save her but to get her out of the power of Sister Hulda. To expel that terrible woman from our house is the great work before us, and I invoke God's help." "Amen!" responded Winfred. "But see, mother has turned toward the city, and is motioning us to follow." "1 understand why she rides to the city ; it is that, per- chance, Charles Hunting might see me riding in company with the Count Von Mardeck. If he should, you, Winfred, must see him this very day and explain to him that I did not ac- company the Count, and that I am his forever." "Still in love with Charley," said Winfi-cd, good-naturcd- ly. The cavalcade reached the main thoroughfare of the city, and were met by a grand procession which stretched out for  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7121-00000108"/> 214     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" miles, with thousands of men, and even school-boys, in its ranks, all in regalia, carrying banners with the emblem of the cross and numerous saints, all formed into companies, with a large number of marshals, and grand marshals on horseback riding to and fro, and every division accompanied by a band of music playing lively airs. It was an imposing scene. "Our Catholic friends are celebrating the birthday of some saint: they are the most devotedly religious people on the face of the earth," remarked Mrs. La Monte to the Count. "They are; the ignorant portion are devoted to their re- ligion through fear, the enlightened through interest. The heads of the church aim to rule the world, and to rule the world pays. If all these people whom you see in this pro- cession had a correct conception of religion, what do you suppose they would do?" said the Count. "What would they do?" asked Mrs. La Monte quickly. "If each man who wastes a day's wages, and perhaps in honor of the gala-day spends the earnings of two more days, would devote that money, and the money which is spent for music, carriages, and other incidental expenses, making a total of fifteen or twenty thousand dollars,-if they would place that suml into a relief fund, appoint out of their number a board of trustees to divide it quietly among the worthy needy who need an intelligent, helping hand to bridge over a difficulty when want of employment or sickness overtakes them-this is true religious devotion ; but to waste a day in parade to pay for music, carriages, etc., because some useful man called a saint was born centuries ago, is a folly. .It is a wicked waste of tinme and money, as it often ends in carousing and riot. 'Far nobler would it be if the leaders of the church discouraged such waste of time and treasure, and inaugurated a plan in- stead to devote the earnings of that one day for a charitable fund to support their owni poor, with which, I am informed,   OR, OUR DESTINY.        215 the 'Relief Union' in every city and town is now bur- dened," observed the Count with great earnestness. "Count it seems to me that you have a prejudice against the Catholics," remarked Mrs. La Monte in a bitter tone. Madam, you do me a great injustice to suppose that I am so retrograde in my mental development and civiliza- tion as to harbor thoughts of prejudice against an individual or a class on account of race or creed. Thank God, that I feel that I have reached that high point of civilization which enables me to look upon every individual, of whatever race and creed he may be, without prejudice. I look upon every man as a being of noble motives and ability as long as the contrary is not proven-" Very considerate; but still I notice a mistrust and a dis- dain in your remarks as regards the Catholics," interrupted Mrs. La Monte. ' The Catholics are, on the whole, a people of many merits. They are not afraid of work, they are brave and valiant, they have no fear of marriage and its natural results; the only fault they have is, that they do hot pause and reason on relig- ious matters; that they blindly obey their clergy and' even be- lieve that the head of their church is ' infallible,' and that he is to be obeyed in political as well as religious matters. This very imposing procession which we now behold is dictated by their clergy for no religious purpose, but political effect, to entrap political demagogues, who are to be used to carry into effect whatever the conclave of priests may decide upon. If there be a mistrust and disdain in my remarks against the Catholics, it is owing to the fact that, when a numerous peo- ple blindly obey their clergy, and that clergy is determined to rule church and state for their own sellish purpose, such people expose themselves to the mistrust and disdain of every enlightened, liberty-loving man," observed the Count tholughtfully.  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7121-00000109"/> 216     "TIE FORGIVING KISS;" " "It is a scare-crow! just as the playing of the passing band of music is to mv horse. Let us ride to the next street, to avoid the procession, as my horse is getting rather unnman- ageable," said Mrs. La Monte, turning to the next street. Rosalind remarked to her brother, "Did I not tell you mother is anxious that Charley should see ime riding in corn- pany with the Count? If he should see us, you must explain it to him this very evening."  "I will; but see, mother is riding headlong, regardless  of pedestrians and the city ordinance. Let us follow;" and on  they rode in quick trot, and soon reached that part of the street which was devoted to the wholesale traders, and it  being unusual to see on that thoroughfare ladies on horse- [ back, they attracted general attention. Charles Hunting,  j now a partner of the great house of Edward Hunting &amp; Son, also looked to see who was passing, and when he beheld Miss Rosalind La Monte, his beloved, beautiful Rosalind,  looking the very picture of graceful dignity, riding in the company of the Coun t Carl Von Mardeck, his heart stopped.  beating for a moment, the blood left his cheeks, he grew pale, his teeth were firmly set, and angry flashes shone froml his piercing eyes. Rosalind observed him, and coinprehended  his feeling. She nodded to him very friendlily, and dropped her handkerchief to give him an opportunity to pick it up and her the chance to whisper to him, ' Yours forever,' but Charles was too excited, too angry to see, and too ungallant to stooD and pick up a handkerchief for her for whom he would have sacrificed his life. Rosalind was distressed. The thought that her dear Charles might, on account of seeing her riding in the company of the Count Von Mardeck, again lead a dissipated life, made her very unhappy. She reached her room, suffering firo a severe headache, and was glad to retire and seek consolation in prayer, and in the hope that Winfred would see Charles and   OR, OUR DESTINY.        217 explain, inr which, however, the trusty brother did not suc- ceed; for Charles Hunting would not grant him an interview. Winfred on reaching home found the family retired, and impatiently awaited the morning to dawn, and impart to his father the true character of Sister Hulda. Winfred was up early in the morning, walking in the gar- den watching for his father, who used to take a morning walk before breakfast. But since he had changed his home his father had changed tin many respects: he slept later and conversed less than formerly ; his time was now more occu- pied with reading the newspapers and attending to his hot- house. Winfred was astonished at the great change and the coldness with which he was received by his father. Breakfast was served. Rosalind did not appear, as she felt too unwell. Mr. and Mrs. La Monte seemed in a very bad humor, which was the result of Viola's letter and the com- ments thereon by Sister Hulda. Mrs. La Monte severely blamed her husband for consenting, and, if anything, encour- aging, the marriage between Otto Wehlen and her darling Viola. She now openly declared that she would do her best to bring about a divorce between the young couple, and use her full power to marry Viola to the Count Carl Von Mar- deck. All this was a bitter, a very bitter pill for Mr. John Janes La Monte to swallow, and he hastened to leave the house, and reach the bank, where he was lord, courted and flattered by those who needed his financial aid. Winfred had therefore no chance to speak to his father that morning. Mr. La Monte was hardly gone, when a telegraph mes- senger arrived, bringing a dispatch which read: "MR. AND MRS. JOHN JAMES LA MONTE: "We will arrive this morning at eight, and will be very happy to see you in our home on Rox Street.

Where is Rux Street? It cannot be a fashion- able street, for I was born and brought up in this city, and never heard of Rox Street. No! my daughter shall not live on Rox Street! And how he signed that telegram-Otto Wehlen and wife  Why not Mr.- and Mrs. Otto Wehlen,  or Otto Wehlen and Lady? But what can one expect from a plebeian! He looks upon his wife as a partner, and signs the telegraphic dispatch accordingly. But he shall not have her as his partner! the very name of Wehlen is common to my ears and eyes. She shall not remain his wife unless he will live and do as I direct." "I should say so," interrupted Sister Hulda. "He ought to be glad that you, my noble lady, take such a great inter- est in him. Thousands of sons-in-law would feel gratified to have such a mother-in-law who takes such an interest in them as to direct them to live on a fashionable street; and if Mr. Otto Wehlen could not afford to live on a fashiona- ble street, he had no right to marry your daughter." "You are always right, Sister Hulda; I wish my husband had half the sense that you have, I would have been spared the humiliation of having my daughter married to a son of my former housekeeper, and who now resides on Rox Street. But where is Rox Street?" "Perhaps Jim knows; shall I ring the bell for him?" You are again right; ring the bell." Jim appeared promptly, and made his usual obedient bow. "Jim, do you know where Rox Street is?" "Yes, madam, I do. Rox Street is in the northern part of the city; it is on high ground, from which the whole city and river can be seen. It is in a healthy neighborhood; 1 passed there several times, and noticed particularly the A-,'   OR, OUA DESTIIY        29 219 children, how healthy they looked-beautiful, notwithstani- ing their patched clothes." "Mercy! mercy! My daughter to reside on a street where the children wear patched clothes! This will never do for a born La Monte-for a grandchild of the Bottwells! Quick, quick! bring my carriage! let me hasten there and bring her away, before it gets known among lpy acquaint- ances that my daughter lives on Rox Street, where children play in mended clothes." "You are correct in your views; it must be a poor neigh- borhood, for rich parents would not have their children go about in old mended clothes," added Sister Hulda, with gravity. "Yes, it must be in a German neighborhood; the Ger- mans are very economical; they make one coat serve three generations; and after having faithfully served as a coat for three generations, it is ripped apart, and the best part se- lected for a jacket and a vest, and what is still left is saved for patching. This may suit the Germans, but we Ameri- cans have ,no taste for such saving and scraping; at least, my daughter need not learn such economy. How impatient I am to get there and give that son-in-law a piece of my mind "  Mrs. La Monte continued in the same strain, which Sister Hulda warmly encouraged. The carriage drew up before the door, and Mrs. La Monte, stepping into it, assured Sister Hulda that her son- in-law must obey, or she would bring her daughter Viola with her oh her return.  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7121-00000111"/> o20   6 TIH FORGIVING KISS;" CHAPTER VIII.                .

IN the first chapter, the author has minutely described the arrival of Mrs. La Monte at the home of the young couple, her conversation and behavior, al- most forcing Viola into her carriage, and carrying her off to her palatial home, in which a Jesuitical woman was rooted with a fixed purpose of ruling or ruining. Sister HuLlda was delighted when she saw Mrs. La Monte bringing her daughter Viola, and congratulated her upon her success, and said, "Your.triumph again confirms tne in my opinion that you are a lady of extraordinary qualities; you possess the sagacity to plan, the will and the energy to execute, whatever you think right and proper.  I verily think that your belief in the Catholic faith, and especially your belief in the infallibility of his Holiness the Pope, makes you so wise. My noble lady, I rejoice that every- thing goes so well with you. I feel happy in the thought of the great future you have before you, for I predict that you will be one of the foremost leaders of the Church of Rome. Your name will be spoken with veneration wherever the light of civilization shines. As a token of my regard, and as my prayerful solicitude for your future welfare and greatness, accept of me this cross; wear it as a symbol of. your' firm    OR, OUR DESTINY.        22. 221 faith in Him who died for us that we may live, and who is now represented on earth by the Holy Father, to whoml we all owe allegiance before any one else." I thank you for your praise and for your present. I do not deserve them, and you will not be of the same opinion when you hear that I have almost decided not to join the Catholic Church." Sister Hulda grew pale, crossed herself, and quickly asked, "Why have you changed your mind?" "It distresses Rosalind, and the Count Von Mardeck has also enlightened me somewhat on the subject. But let us not now speak on so grave a topic. Viola has had no break. fast; please have it served. I wish to be alone, for I have misgivings that I have acted wrongly in forcing the wife away from her husband." Sister Hulda was about to make her usual observation, which Mrs. La Monte observed; she waved her hand, and said with an unusually commanding tone, "I wish to be left alone." As soon as Sister Hulda left the room, Mrs. La Monte exclaimed, "Rosalind, you have uttered a sentence which has entered into my soul as sunbeams into darkness; it is, 'pause and reason!' and henceforth I will pause and reason." Sister Hulda stood outside the door and listened to Mrs. La Monte's ejaculation, and silently repeated, " 'Pause and reason' is fatal to the plan of the Jesuits; 'pause and rea- son' is fatal to the doctrine of the Pope's infallibility, and his pretensions to represent the Lord Jesus Christ on earth. I hate Rosalind more than ever for having planted this fatal principle, ( pause and reason,' in her mother's mind. If this principle, 'pause and reason,' should take root in her nature, she is irrevocably lost to the church and the cause of the Jesuits. I too will now 'pause and reason, survey  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7121-00000112"/> "TIE FORGIVING KISS; " the whole field, and see where I actually stand, and what my prospects are for success. And she thought on: " The idea of building the church in the absence of Mr. John James La Monte must be abandoned, as the sudden appearance of Winfred at home gave his father no opportunity to travel, to visit him. The Count Von Mardeck, who is a Catholic, is evidently one of those Catholics who call themselves ' Lib- eral.' They believe in the sublime teachings of Catholi- cism, but not in the clergy, whom they would like to see di- vested of their temporal power and dignity. I hate such Catholics more than I do even the Protestants. Henceforth I will endeavor not to give the Count the opportunity to slpeak to Mrs. La Monte unless I am present. But who is it that counteracts all my designs? It is Rosalind-it is she who has caused her brother to come home. It is she who, no doubt, invited the Count to lower Catholicism in the esteem of her 'mother.  It is she who is ily mortal enemy, and whose superior intelligence will thwart all my plans. She it is who causes me all this agony and fear of failing. Vengeance ! vengeance! cries my innermost nat- ure. I will be revenged on her. She is in my way, and whoever is in my way, and the order's, must be removed, and she shall be removed." Softly Sister Hulda entered the room of Rosalind, and found both sisters weeping. " I like to see sisters weep for joy. Your mother has directed me to ask you what you will have for breakfast, and will you have it served in the dining- roomi or in this rooml ? As Miss Rosalind complains of being unwell, it may be more convenient to have the break- fast served here." "We will breakfast as usual in the dining-room. What will you have for breakfast, Viola?" " Anything you order, Rosalind, will suit me," answered Viola.    OR, OUR DES7NTVy. 223 "A cup of good coffee, some eggs, and some toast; that is all," directed Rosalind(, Sister Hulda left the room, and soon after announced that breakfast was ready. The sisters repaired to the dining-room, took their seats at the inviting table, and Sister Hulda poured out the steaming coffee into the cups. While thus engaged, she gave a slight pressure on the snake-formed ring which graced her middle finger, a drop of liquid fell into the cup, and that cup she offered to Rosalind, who took it. Viola said, "Rosalind, let ine have your cup; mine has too much cleamll in it."  The sisters made the change, while Sister Hulda stepped to the window to draw the curtain lower, to keep out the rays of the sun. Viola drank the poisoned coffee to the very last drop. Suddenly she exclaimed, " The blood rushes to my head! "Where am I ? What do you want of me ?  I am not crazy ! I have my senses !"  She grasped the tablecloth, pulled it from the table, and made a wreck of the crockery, shouting, "I defy you all ! I have the strength of a tiger ! hi, Ihi, hi ! you cannot-harm me, I have my senses !" Rosalind sprang to her feet, and tremblingly exclaimed, "Hold, my dear sister ! Viola ! for God's sake, what is the matter with you ? Your looks, your words, your actions fireeze the blood inl ly veins." " Leave- me alone ! hi, hi, hi  I am not afraid of you !" grasping the back of a chair, and lifting it high up in a threatening manner. Rosalind ruslhed froml the room, calling in a voice full of distress, " Mother! mother! mother! please come down ! something has happened to Viola-she is crazy ! "My Viola crazy!" responded Mrs. La Monte, with agonizing fear, and rushing into the dining-room, where she   &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7121-00000113"/> 224     1 , TIE FORGIVING KISS;"        ,  found Viola holding Sister -Hulda by the throat, shaking her as a cat shakes a caught mouse. "'Who are you, you false creature? I want my Otto! Give me back my Otto, or I will choke you to death!" With great effort, the mother and sister succeeded in  loosening the hands of Viola on Sister HUnlda, who gasped for breath ; a moment longer in the furious grasp of Viola, and she would have been a corpse. "Viola, my darling Viola, what is the matter with you? Don't you recognize me, your loving mother?" The voice of the mother seemed to recall her senses, and Viola gazed on her mother with recognition, and slowly said: "You-nare--my-mlother---but not a loving mother; you-have-torn--me-away-from-lmy husband, and a mother who tears away a wife from a husband has no right  to call herself a loving mother; hi! hi I hi i hi! I am not  crazy; I want my Otto. You have robbed me of my Otto, woman! give me back my Otto, or I do not know what 1 shall do with you ;" and with these words the unfortunate Viola upset the table with a crash. For the first time in her life did Mrs. La Monte feel real grief. In the possession of health and wealth, she never thought of the poor, of the forsaken, of the unfortunate, who, through ignorance, through sickness, through unjust laws, through bad customs, or through bad habits become helpless creatures who need the helping hand of the intelli- gent and wealthy. That hand which to a large extent she could stretch forth she never extended, therefore she never saw grief, and as a consequence knew not how to alleviate it and soothe misfortune. Thunder-struck, she stood before her smitten daughter, and tears of heart-felt grief, the first she ever shed in her life, flowed fast down her checks. Rosalind gently laid her hand on her sister's head, gazed in her eyes, and in her most affectionate voice said,   . i   OR, OUR DESTINY,        225 ' Viola, my dear sister, come with me to your room ; I will dress you, and then you and I will go to Otto and make it all up." "Will you dress me beautifully?" ".I will dress. you beautifully you shall look prettier than ever. Come " Slowly did the sisters repair to the same roolm which they only a few moments before had left hopeful of a happy future. Alas, what a change!-one with an impaired. mind, the other with an almost broken heart. "Sister, dear," said Rosalind, "would it not be better if I wrote a few lines to Otto, to have him come here and make it up? it would look better." "Did you speak to me?" Rosalind repeated her remarks. "Yes, yes, yes, yes," was the slow, absent-minded re- sponse. Rosalind quickly took pen, ink, and paper, and wrote hastily to her father to come home without a mIoment's delay, and dispatched the letter at once by Jim l While this sad scene was passing at the hpuse of Mr. John James La Monte, Winfred was in his father's private office at the bank, begging him to dismiss Sister Hulda at once; as he said she was one of the Jesuitical schemers " who work with might and main for the interest of that order, which is continually on the alert to discover the weak side of every character; to flatter every passion and prejudice; to cause discord and jealousy where love and confidence ought to exist, for -the purpose of extracting secrets which could be made profitable to the Jesuits, and to-" '"Vour fears are groundless," interrupted the father; ' I have not seen anything wrong in Sister Hulda ; and even if she is a Jesuit, she could not influence your mother, for she is a lady to the manor born.

"This is very unfortunate for our country, for the Irish and German women will be the future mothers of the largest part of the population of this republic, and if the Jesuits have influence over them, they will shape its destiny." "Stop " again interrupted the father; ' your observations are unbecoming to a young man of your age. You had bet- ter leave the city, and be about your geological pursuits. I am (ispleased, and disapprove of your leaving your post with- out first asking my permission. I now direct you to at once go about your work, and do not trouble yourself about Sis- ter Hulda. She is an excellent servant; I should not like to lose her services." "But, father-" "No buts! I command you at once to j ount your horse, and ride post-haste to your field of occupation. Adieu!" With these words, the father left his son standing almost petrified. "Yes," exclaimed he, "I will go, and many will be the years before I return to the home of my youth, for my mother and my father feel no more affection for me." Quickly he tore a leaf from his 'nemlorandum-book, and wrote: "DEAR SISTER ROSALIND :-Father has ordered me to leave immediately for- my field of occupation, and not to trouble myself about Sister Hulda. Seeing that my influ- ence is so small with our parents, and fearing that in some moment of anger 1 might commit a too hostile act toward that hateful Jesuit, I leave the city, and bid you an affec- tionate good-by.

Mr. La Monte entered the discount-room angry and discontented, and found the head clerk waiting to show him several notes which had been brought in to be dis- counted. The chief glanced at the "paper," and exclaimed in a sullen voice, "I will not discount them to-day; return them 1" The clerk looked amazed, and ventured to say, "Mr. La Monte, you have not perhaps noticed the signature of the notes; they are from Edward Hunting &amp; Son. The house is not the same as it used to be before the son took an active part in it. Formerly they had trouble in meeting their paper promptly; it resembled an elephant without blood. But Charles put life in it." "Pass the notes to their credit at the rate of eight per cent.," said Mr. La Monte ; and speaking to himself, "Vhen shall I be so enlightened that home troubles will not influ- ence and cloud my judgmnent."  Charles Hunting is a rising man. Did you see in the morning paper that he is announced to deliver a lecture before the Young Men's Christian Association?" re- marked the observing head clerk. I did not see it ; where is it?" It is in the local columns;" and the young man took the newspaper, and read  "' A FREE LECTURE. "W e are glad to announce that the Board of Control of the Young Men's Christian Association have succeeded in inducing hAr. Charles -Hunting, of the prominent hottu s of Edward Hunting &amp; Son, to deliver the first lecture of the fall season before the Youn1g Meni's Christian Association.  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7121-00000115"/> 228     "T TiE FORGIVING K!"SS;" We sincerely hope that a full house will greet that promising young man, and that he will prove as successful a lecturer, as he is a merchant.' " "Very flattering," said Mr. La Monte thoughtfully. At this juncture, the Board of Directors were announced. The result of their meeting, and the subsequent interview be- tween Mr. John James La Monte and his son-in-law, Otto Wehlen, have been already laid before the reader, who will now follow Mr. La Monte to his home, which he found in great confision, as Viola was raving mad, breaking furni- ture, and threatening the lives of the inmates. It is sad for parents to have children whose minds are slow to learn; whose inclination is to idle away their time with trifles; who are unreasonable in their demands ;. who insist upon associating with companions who are distaste- ful to their larents and relatives, because such association endangers their moral character and good standing in society, and embitters existence. Parents of such chil- dren deserve not only a heartfelt sympathy, but all the as- sistance that their neighbors can render them. But how iluch more are they to be pitied, if one of'the children is mentally deranged. This is a ghastly wound in the heart, which bleeds ceaselessly; which neither prayer nor philo- sophical reasoning can heal. Such a wound Mr. La Monte now received * in his heart; it bowed him low down to the earth, and he wept tears of the bitterest agony. He approached Viola, and affectionately held her hands, and spoke to her in his tenderest voice. She gazed at him without seeming to recognize him, trying to free her- self, and exclaiming, "Let me loose, or I will show you that I am the strongest." "I know you are," answered the unhappy father good- naturedly ; at the same time withdrawing from his breast coat-pocket an album containing the photographs of his   OR, OUR DESTINY.        229 whole family and Otto Wehlen, he asked, "Can you tell me whose photographs these are?  "This is my Otto!" exclaimed she, snatching the al- bum violently from her father's hand. "You cannot have this album : it is mine! Otto is mine-! Otto! hi! hi! hi! hi! you cannot have him," she cried, trying to hide the album within her bosom ; and at the same time she with- drew the golden tablets which her husband on the same morning so impressively presented her with. A cry of joy escaped- her lips; she kissed the souvenir, called loudly, "Hi! hi! hi!" threw herself on her knees, and began to pray in unintelligible language. The father in the meantime dispatched Jim with the car- riage and a letter for Doctor Dettman, with orders to drive post-haste, and to be sure to bring the doctor back with him. The careful reader will no doubt recollect with what re- luctance Doctor Dettman accepted the offer to ride in Mr. La Monte's carriage drawn by a pair of spirited horses; and nothing but the name of "Sister Hulda " gave him the courage to trust his precious life to the charge of such a fast team and fast driver. Though very careful of his limbs and health, they became with the good old doctor a second consideration when there was real danger, and where his eminent professional knowledge was necessary. There he hastened regardless of storms and villanously bad roads, perilous though they might be to life and limb. "Thank God that I am here at last, with the only acci- dent of breaking my spectacles! the fearful shaking threw the spectacles from my nose. What roads! When will they have roads in America as they have in Germany?" thoughlt the doctor, as he entered the spacious hall of the princely mansion. Rosalind was the first to greet the trusty doctor.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7121-00000116"/> 230     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" 1 "Rosalindchen, you look agitated," said the doctor, laying his hand on the head of the young lady, and kissing her brow in a fatherly manner: " who is ill?" "Doctor!" exclaimed Rosalind; but she could not pro- ceed-her heart was too full with sorrow. A flood of tears drowned her words.  Mr. La Monte mournfully said that Viola had lost her reason. "Lost her reason! Why, she only returned this morning from her wedding tour, as happy as only a loving wife- can be. Tell me all that has occurred since her arrival in the city and at home." Mrs. La Monte sadly related her visit to Rox Street; her objection to Viola's residing on that street; her gener- ous offer to her son-in-law, to buy him a residence on Clin- ton Heights; his objection to live there; his firm decision to dwell in his house on Rox Street; her anger and humilia- tion at seeing her daughter reside on a street where there  was not one stone-front house, and where none of the fashionable people lived- Fashionable fools," interrupted the doctor, with sar- casm. "I did not see a single elegantly-dressed lady on the whole street. Nothing but plainly dressed women, like the wives and daughters of poor working-men. For my daughter. to  reside on such a street is more than T could bear; and 1  forced Viola into mly carriage. She cried the whole way,  and several times wanted to jump out; but I forcibly held her back. After we arrived home, she and Rosalind took breakfast, and at the table she became raving mad." "On what did she breakfast, and who waited on her? asked the doctor quickly. "Nothing but toast, eggs, and coffee. Sister Hulda waited  on her."   OR, OUR DESTINY.        231 "Where is Sister Hulda? I must see Sister Hulda at once. Please call her." "I will," answered Mrs. La Monte, and called Sister I-ulda. Not receiving a response, she went to her room, and after giving several loud knocks, tried the door and found it locked. Sister Hulda asked in a feeble voice, "W Who is it knocking, and what do you want?" "It is Mrs. La Monte. Please come down immediately to the reception-room; Doctor Dettman wishes to see you." "   I am praying and do not wish to be disturbed," answered Sister Hulda promptly. "Postpone your praying, and come at once; the doctor is waiting." "Prayer before anything, is my rule. I would not post- pone my prayer if the Emperor of Germany himself com- manded it." "It is Mrs. La Monte, whose frienidship you seemed to court and value, who now requests you to come with her to the reception-rootm, and explain to Doctor Dettman how Viola behaved when she becIame demented." After a few moments' hesitation Sister Hulda unbolted' the door, and accompanied Mrs. La Monte to the recep- tion-room, where the doctor waited, carefully noticing the movements and words of Viola. "You are not Otto," exclaimed Viola, holding fast to the armn of the doctor, " for your mustache is gray-white--Otto -Otto-Ol:-to-give me your memlorandum-book and pen- cil." And the unfortunate young wife at the same time snatched them from the doctor's hands and wrote hastily: "Otto, take me as I am, And improve me all you can."  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7121-00000117"/> 232     "THEI FORGIVING KISS;" The doctor quickly noticed what Viola wrote, and mut- tered:  "A sure sign of lunacy when one begins to write verses." Viola continued- "I am beautiful, I am handsome, But without you I am lonesome." The book and pencil fell froml her hand, and she moaned and groaned in an unnatural manner. Suddenly she paused, but alas! her reason was dethroned ; she flung the door wide open and called, "Rosalinosalind salind! Ros- alind! where are you? I want to pray; teach me how to pray. My mother! hi I hi hi hi! hi! my mother! hi! hi! hi! Rosalind! Rosalind! where are you?" "Come, my dear darling daughter, I will lead you to Ros- alind: she is in her room," begged the unhappy father with a broken voice. Mrs. La Monte wrung her hands in despair, and said, "'Would to God I had not interfered between her and her husband i If it was good enough for the husband to reside on Rox Street, it ought to have been good enough for her. And I, miserable creature that I am, woe is me! woe is me! I am the cause of her misfortune; woe is me!" and mourn- fully she followed Viola and Mr. La Monte to Rosalind's room. As soon as the parents and their unfortunate daughter left the room, Doctor Dettman quickly locked the door and placed the key in his pocket, which Sister Hulda anxiously noticed and grew a shade paler. "We are all alone, and I ask you to tell me what kind of poison you have administered to that young woman ; be quick with your answer, for there is no time to be lost." "You impudent Jew; how dare you accuse nme, a servant of the Lord, of such a crime!" exclaimed Sister Hulda   OR, OUR? DESTINY.       233 with earnestness, and all the dignity of which she was ca- pable. "I have no objection for you or any one else to call me a Jew, for this is a title that only a handful out of the mil- lions of men possess. What I object to is, for you or any one else to call me impudent, if I interfere with your pur- suits of fostering ignorance and crime. H-ulda Mucker, you are not a servant of the Lord, you are a servant of the devil. You are a slave of the Jesuits, and their impudence knows no limits: it fills the whole world. The schemes of the Jesuit order have caused humanity to weep and to bleed; and, what is worse than all, to retrograde in civilization and enlightened liberty. They would have made of earth a hell, were it not for the Jews, who stood up, an :unbroken phalanx  for religious liberty, the right to reason before they believe; -and as sure as the Jews are right in their view that every one has the right to worship according to the dictates of his conscience, so sure am I that you, Hulda Mucker, have poisoned that young woman, and if there is a spark of hu- manity yet left in your bosom, you will not hesitate a mo- ment to tell me the name of that singular poison, as it may aid me to cure the unfortunate lady." "I have not poisoned that young lady; it is a false ac- cusation." "You will either tell me the name of the poison which you have used, or you will not leave this room a sane per- son. Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth; and I will add, reason for reason." "But you have to prove the guilt by a positive and unde- niable witness, before you can execute the laws. This is the Mosaic law," said Sister Hulda, alarmed at the doctor's de- termined voice and mien; for he now took a vial from his medicine-chest. "Hulda Mucker, you are not a stranger to me. Father  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7121-00000118"/> 234     "TIIE FORGI'VING KlSS;" Pontifus Matznevsky, a former school-fellow of mine, who lately arrived from Rome and so suddenly died, told me your history. You are wicked--wicked enough to poison a hundred persons, if you thereby can serve your purpose. That you have poisoned Viola, I have no doubt in my mind. The only thing which I cannot explain is, why you have poi- soned Viola instead of Rosalind. This is what puzzles me, but ,who can tell the motives of the wicked? God only knows them." "And God only has a right to punish them," interrupted Sister Hulda promptly. "And so He has, but society has the right to protect itself from such monsters as you are. Once more I ask you whether you will tell me the name of the poison which you have used. Answer quickly, ere I remove the stopper from this vial." The doctor hesitated a moment, drew a handkerchief from his pocket, made a loose ball of it; placed it in his mouth, and pressing a part of it against his nostrils, removed the stopper from the vial, and stretched forth his hands. With one hand he grasped Sister Hulda's wrists, and with the other, held forth the vial, from which emanated an odor that benumbed the senses. "Take away the vial, and I will show you the poison which 1 have used," begged Sister Hulda. The doctor quickly placed the stopper in the vial. "( You were not a moment too soon. What is the name of the poison? quick with your answer." "I do not know its name; it was sent to me from Mexico. You will find a part of it in this ring on my finger. Please open the window-I am growing dizzy." The doctor sprang to his medicine-chest, opened another vial, and said, "Inhale of this as much as you can; it will give you relief, and save you from insanity."   OR, OUR DESTINY.        235 Sister Hulda looked suspiciously at the doctor, who conm- prehended her look, and answered, "I do not claim to be a servant of the Lord, but I claim to be a servant of humanity. You can trust me, for whatever I do, I do for the best for my fellow-men." Sister Hulda inhaled from the second vial, and soon colm- nmenced to sneeze in rapid succession, and to bleed from the nose. "Ten drops of blood you must lose," said the doctor, and commenced to count the drops. At the ninth drop he lifted her left hand high up, and held it for a few monwe1ts, and the bleeding of the nose ceased. "You are now saved," said the doctor; "open the ring, and pour the contents into a tumbler" (which he took from the medicine-chest). Without an answer, Hulda Mucker obeyed. The doctor started at the sighlt of that poison, and ex- claimed, It is the same which has been used on the Eml- press Carlotta of Mexico! Poor Viola! what will be thy fate?" "And what will be my fate? I am now in your power, and the Jews are revengeful." "The Jews as a class are too wise to be revengeful, for they know that revenge is sweet, but remorse is bitter. Ple- sides that, they are the politest people in the world. I would tlherefore recommennd you in the politest manner to leave this house instantly, and if possible go back to Europle. I know that the territory in Europe is getting rather limited for the Jesuits and their instruments. From G(erman)ly lh1, are expelle1d; fromn Italy they are expelled ; from Rome itself they are expelled ; in Austria they have only a slippery foot- hold.

The doctor unlocked the door, and pointed to Hulda Mucker, to be gone. Humbled and grieved, she left the room. Arriving at her apartment, she wrote the following letter: "MR s. JOHN JAMES LA MONTE: "MY DEAR MADAMT :-Your continued hesitation to enm- brace the Catholic faith las undoubtedly brought on as a great punishment the misfortune to your daughter Viola, who through your conduct has lost her reason; and my stay in your houtse is now useless and unpllleasant. I have there- fore determined to bid you adieu, assuring you that in my seclusion I will pray for you and yours, that you may bear all afflictions with Christian resignation, and that you may yet resolve to embrace the true faith, and become one of its great stars, whose brilliancy will even shine before the glori- ous abode of his Holiness, the infallible Pope, who will bless you with his choicest blessings. Amen. "SISTER HULDA." After the doctor left the house, Mr,. La Monte hastened to the room of Sister Hulda, where she forund the letter  on the table, which she read with mingled surprise, astonish- ment, and mortification, and exclaimed, "What is the meaning of this? her flight so sudden? Is it possible that she is indeed the heartless, scheming Jesuitess which my wise Rosalind described? One should pause and reason before }.   OR, OUR DESTINY.        237 taking any one into one's house and into one's confidence. Thank God, she is gone." Sister Hulda, dejected in spirit, arrived it Father Ignatius' busy office, where now were fifty secretaries writing: some answered letters, some made inquiries of their extensive correspondents in regard to the men who, were to be candi- dates before the preliminary elections, while some wrote ed- itorials for the different papers published in all parts of the country, with a view to shape public opinion,' and have the school fund divided in order to have all the Catholic youths educated under the direct supervision of the Catholic clergy. This measure was decided upon in Rome, and Father Igna- tius, as the general of all the Jesuits in America, was intrusted with the speedy execution of this measure in the United States, to which Father Ignatius gave his closest attention. Not only did he dictate the ablest editorials which appeared in defence of the division of the school fund, but he actually used his great influence to have all the papers put under ban which boldly opposed the measure and manfully objected to the Catholic clergy's shaping legislation to advance the prosperity of the Roman Catholic Church, and enable it to govern the state. Sister Hulda could not be admitted into the private office of Father Ignatius, as he was closeted with his Grace and other dignitaries of the church, who seriously debated the bold measure of placing such papers under ban as were not friendly to the Church of Rome. His Grace the Arch- bishop expressed great doubts whether the ban would be wise, but Father Ignatius replied, "'Papers which cannot be bought to support our aims must be crushed out of ex- istence for want of patronage. As long as a paper enjoys a large circulation, it enjoys an extensive advertising patron- age, which makes it independent of politicians and our church; but let its circulation diminish, and its adver-  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7121-00000120"/> 238   ,  "THE FORGIVIVG AIWSS;  tising patronage diminishes with it; and you will soon see those independent, valiant journalists begging on their knees our good-will, and our good-will they can only have by giving us mnlplete control of their editorial and local columns-as far as all church questions are concerned." "Nothing would suit me better than to have the press of this country under my censorship," observed his Grace; and continued with a sigh: "Where are those happy days when our clergy controlled the press, or those still better days when there was no press at all; when there was no spirit of inquiry among the masses, and whatever wisdom existed was in the possession of the Catholic clergy and the Jews, but whom we pushed back and terrified from uttering a word to enlighten others? Those were happy, happy days; we were then masters of the situation, but now we have to battle to hold our own." "Our cause is lost if we do not control the press. rThose who are not for us are against us, and they must receive our serious opposition. The sooner they are out of exist- ence the better. I therefore move that a ban be placed on such journals, one at a time," said Father Ignatius with great energy. The motion was carried, and steps taken to put it in force. This being disposed of, the names of the various candi- dates were read who aspired for municipal or state govern- nmet. Every candidate was carefully commented on, and if found to be of a positive character, and one who could not be controlled by money or position, was crossed from the list, and the political wire-pullers of the preliminary election advised of the fact. "Reverend gentlemen," said F atter Ignatius gravely, "nothing is so important as to get the right men on the school board; what I mean by that is, men who are careless   OR, OUR DESTINY.        239 in attending to. meetings; and if they do come to the meet- ings, consume the time in airing their windy eloquence and in being very, very lavish in appropriation; build very costly school-houses on very expensive lots ;crowd as nany incapable teachers as possible into one school; have a great many superintendents; teach the children what is posi- tively useless to them, and favor as many vacations as pos- sible. To have such men on the school board is a godsend to us, and if we do not get them on that board it shall not be our fault." His Grace was decidedly of the same opinion, and the lists of the candidates for the school board were re-com- mitted, to be acted upon at a special meeting to be called by Father Ignatius. The public library was then taken into consideration. A catalogue of the books was produced by one of the fathers of the conclave, and earnestly discussed. "The Wandering Jew," "Our Prospects," and even the "History of Eng- land," by Macaulay, were considered bad books for the Catholic youth to read they enlightened them too much for the good of the reader, but to the great disadvantage of the Catholic clergy and the Jesuit order. Father Ignatius again was the main spokesman, and ad- dressed especially his Grace, who should, as the spiritual guide of the Catholic community, protect his- flock, especially the rising generation, from reading such vile works; he was in favor, and sincerely hoped, that his co-laborers in the church would entertain the same views, of his Grace the Arch- bishop in his official capacity publicly denouncing the public library, and warning parents and the children not to take any books from its shelves. None made a remark. The archbishop with great dig- nity said: "Reverend fathers, before 1 take that course, I deem  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7121-00000121"/> 240     "77 TE FOR GIVING KISS;' it my duty to draw your attention to the fact, that to exclude all the Catholic children from the public library, as it has been suggested, is impracticable, and I think almost impos- sible. We ought not to discourage our children from read- ing, or they will remain too ignorant to cope successfully with their fellow-men in the daily walks of life; we ought, if anything, to encourage them to read, but only good books.  I would therefore request Father Ignatius to so shape his suggestion as to warn parentijand their children not to take any books from the public library, except such as the priests of their respective congregations from time to time recommend." These remarks made a deep impression, but Father Ignatius was obstinate; he was not in favor of half measures; he thought it best to keep the children entirely away from the public library, for when they once get there they read too many newspapers, and. among them '"Harper's Weekly," another sheet which he said ought not to be seen by young Catholic eyes. "It is best to totally discourage our youth from visiting the public library; I will therefore not shape my suggestion as his Grace advises, but beg your leave to withdraw it and offer it in its original or its amended forml at our next meeting." No objection being made, Father Ignatius was permitted to withdraw his suggestion. The archbishop's intellectual countenance grew a shade paler from suppressed wrath, in seeing his suggestion so coldly and diplomatically treated; he was well aware that Father Ignatius, now as the director of the order of the Jesuits in the United States, would again press his original pro- posal, and insist that it should be adopted, and by him ex- ecuted. It was a bitter pill for his Grace to swallow, and what most mortified him was that it was his former secre- tary who had so much power, and who enjoyed exceedingly   OR, OUl DESTINrY.        24 letting him feel that power. He could have had that posi- tion himself if he had devoted his time and talent for the benefit of the order; but he preferred to devote both time and talent to the enlargement of his personal wealth, and he was now the slave instead of the master of the order. Father Ignatius correctly guessing the thoughts of his Grace, heartily enjoyed his triumph ;.and after a few moments of silence, asked his Grace whether he had anything to sub- mit for consideration. "Yes, we will now consider the names of such Catholics who are wealthy, and who do not contribute liberally tow- ard their church and her institutions," answered his Grace, opening a huge document containing hundreds of names of numerous villages and cities. "This is very important business, which requires and deserves very careful attention; it is necessary to ascertain how much wealth each man or woman actually possesses, their mode of living, their natural inclinations, and what influences must be used in order to attach them to the church' and her institutions. It is also necessary to have their priest make the proper suggestion, when they make their last will and testament, not to forget to leave a share to the church. To go into details is too laborious; 1 therefore suggest that this list be referred to a special commnittee of three, with power to act and report progress." "How shall that important committee be appointed?" asked his Grace. B( y the archbishop," was the unanimous response. "I appoint Father Ignatius as chairman, with power to appoint the. other two of that committee." All looked amazed at his Grace, wondering that he should appoint that committee in such an unusual manner. But Father Ignatius comprehended at a glance what his Grace aimed at, and quickly- stated that he declined to appoint the "  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7121-00000122"/> other two of the committee, and would therefore request his Grace to appoint the whole committee. "If that is the general wish, I will name the remainder of the committee at some future time." There was again a painful silence and. disappointment prevailing among the reverend fathers. His Grace expected the courtesy of being added on that committee; and seeing that that courtesy was not offered, revenged himself by not appointing the whole committee from among the members present. His Grace, then, speaking of the conversion of prominent Protestants to the Catholic Church, said that Mrs. John James La Monte had expressed a willingness to embrace the Catholic faith, and build in its honor a beautiful church on her premises, and provide for the priest. "This great event must remain, however, as yet strictly secret, as Mrs. La Monte wishes to obtain the consent of her husband to her change of religion, and that consent can only be obtained: by assuring to vMr. La Monte the Catholic vote as Governor of the State, and negotiations through prominent politicians have already been commenced with Mr. La Monte, who is nibbling at the tempting bait; but it is yet a question whether he will be caught. However, the proper efforts are now in progress." Father Ignatius was displeased with the report of his Grace, because he did not make any allusion to Sister Hulda, who had worked the case up to its present promising state; and he therefore wished that the whole would prove a fail- ure, as his Grace seemed to take all the credit to himself, and resolved to work accordingly. All the business for the present being disposed of, the conclave adjourned. Father Ignatius escorted his, Grace and his colleagues to the hall, and quickly observed Sister Hulda waiting in the   ,-7, UU L'ES7TINY.      243 ante-room ; he invited her to his private office. "Be seated," said he pleasantly. "You look dejected; has anything hap- pened to discourage you?" "I an miserable " exclaimed Sister Hulda. She could not proceed; her grief overpowered her, and she wept. "Tears in your eyes! I never expected to see tears there," remarked Father Ignatius, earnestly looking with surprise at the dejected, weeping woman. The words and looks of Father Ignatius had a magical effect upon Sister Hulda; her tears ceased to flow, and she stood erect, saying, "It is very strange that I should weep, but my love for the order and the church is stronger than my pride." "And, I fear, stronger than yourjudgment," added Father8 Ignatius, promptly and with disdain. Sister Hulda bowed her head submissively, and remained silent. "Sister Hulda, look up and note the sign I now give." Sister Hulda looked up. "Do you comprehend the meaning of that sign?" "I do." "Answer it."  "That you, as my chief, demand of me the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,'as if I were in the confessional." "Proceed, and let me know the fullest detail." Slowly did Sister Hulda relate all that had passed in the houws of La Monte: the serious opposition of Rosalind,  whom she could not rule or conquer, and whom it was nec-  essary, therefore, to dispose of by poison; the great misfor- tune that the sisters changed the cups of coffee; the arrival  of Doctor Dettman; his extraordinary proceeding; his dis- missing'her with the warning never to molest that family again, or he would inform the faither and brother of what she had done, and they would shoot her. She obeyed his corn-   &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7121-00000123"/> 244     "THfE 'FORGIVIAG KICSS; " mand, after leaving an explanatory letter for Mrs. La Monte, and now was at the further disposal of his Reverence. "Did I not warn you to avoid violence?" asked Father Ignatius angrily. "You did."  "And why did you not heed my warning?" Sister Hulda fell on her knees, withdrew her crucifix; and commenced to pray. This seemed to arouse Father Ignatius to still greater  anger; he stamped his foot with great energy, and exclaimed,  "You know that one of the mottoes of our order is to pray less and work harder; you seem to pray a good deal, but work very badly, very inefficiently." Father Ignatius, have mercy on me if I have erred." "I will have mercy on our order, by placing you where  your unscrupulousness and disobedience can do it no posi- tive injury. You will be escorted as a prisoner to a convent : where you will do menial service during the rest of your  natural life." Sister Hulda wrung her hands in despair, begged and imnplored, kissed the hem of the coat of Father Ignatius while he wrote out an order, and to which he attached his great official seal. "Spare me this scene, or I will write an order to put you in prison, where you will not see daylight during the rest of your days." Not another word, not another sigh, escaped Sister Hulda's i lips. Father Ignatius touched a bell; the same deaf and dumb  waiter who attended the ever memorable dinner to Father   I Pontifus, responded to the call.   - Father Ignatius placed the written order in his hands, gave  him instructions by the signs of the fingers, in which both  were adepts, and which Sister Hulda could not comprehend.  ; , J  -7   OR, OUR DESTINY.        245 The speechless and deaf servant took a rough grip on Sis- ter Hulda's wrist, and conducted her through a secret pas- sage to the stable, where he placed her in a close carriage which he carefully locked; and in a few moments Sister Hulda felt that the vehicle was moving at a dangerously rapid rate out of the city, and into the distant country, where she would be placed in the convent, which she reached in safety, and where we finally dismiss from our )ages that pertina- cious instrument of priestcraft. Let her sophistry stand a warning to all not to place confidence in strangers. Never  ind how recommended, how plausibly they speak, and how pleasantly they belave, test them first, to see whether they are what they pretend to be. Pause and rea- son on all they say and do, before you confide in strangers: Reader, by making henceforth this your rule, you will be saved from many mortifications, and even great misfor- tune, and you will have read this volume, if not with de- light, at least with great profit to yourself and your friends. And if only one of the readers of this book should be thus benefited, the author will feel amply repaid for the mental and physical exertion required for its creation. Father Ignatius paced the room up and down in deep meditation; he paused before a large map of the continents which graced the wall, and exclaimed, " The order of the Jesuits has lost its grip on Europe ; it shall under my man- agement fasten its hold on the United States-and by my saying the United States, I mean the whole American Con- tinent." Anld he continued to soliloquize "Yes, the United States shall absorb the whole American Continent, but not before the order of the Jesuits is so firmly rooted in this land that every office, from a constable or a justice of the peace, up to the President and his cabinet, can only be elected by the sanction of the Jesuit order; and of that order I will and shall remain the head-the good genius who will lead it to  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7121-00000124"/> 246     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" unparalleled conquests and unexampled grandeur." The ambitious Jesuit rang the bell with great energy. "Bring a bottle of the oldest wine t1at the cellar con- tains." "Anything else, your Reverence?"              : "Yes, you may bring also a dish of sardines, andI a few slices of rye bread." The order was promptly executed, and Father Ignatius partook freely of a wine of which every glass cost ten dol- lars, calculating the interest on a bottle of wine that is one hundred years old. That old wine in the young body of the Jesuit father began to have its effect: it opened his heart, loosened his tongue, and enlarged his ambition ; he ex- claimed, "Through America I hope to govern Europe, and   t re-establish there our power in a grander-splendor than ever!" He drank another glass, which began to confuse him, and he smilingly said, "What puzzles me, and even annoys me, is  to know whether my cigars, those cigars in my little casket, which I so graciously offered to my guest, Father Pontifus, killed him, or whether he died from some malady. Now I feel the effects of wine as much as Father Pontifus did;   - let me try one of those cigars, and see what effect they will - have on me." He brought the casket, opened it by the touch  of a secret spring, took one of the cigars in his hand, hesi- tated to light it, took another drink, which still more con- fused his reason, and he stammered, "I--H am n-no-     1 co-co-coward; Father Ig--Ig-Ignatius Garnier is no  co-co--coward. I will test this, H-H-will pu-put mly  conscience to rest o-o-on that point." He lit the cigar, and  commenced smoking. Every whiff he took was deadly  poison; the fumes of the poison, stimulated by the wine, ex-  tinguished in him the spark of life. The soul fled to its bountiful and merciful Giver, to receive its final reward for i its doings, while the body in which it was fettered, and which ,  .   OR, OUR DESTINY.        247 it should have ennobled, fell to the ground a corpse, was buried with great pomp, and soon forgotten. With the death of Father Ignatius, we dismiss the subject of the Jesuits and the Catholic clergy, with their determined struggle for great wealth and political power. In this our beloved and blessed country, may the illustration which the author has sketched of that powerful disturbing element prove valuable to our glorious union-and so it will, if its citizens will pay closer attention to the preliminarymeetings; and if by an overwhelming public sentiment they assert that the public school fund shall remain intact, and that all reli- gious instruction shall be banished from the public schools; and furthermore, that all church property, without any dis- tinction whatever, shall be taxed at the same valuation as' other property, it would materially crilple the plotters who oppose general education for their own aggrandizement. And let it be the irrevocable resolution of every citizen of the United States not for a moment to tolerate the idea of connecting the church with the state; not to be allured to put God in the constitution of the States and United States. We have no need for God in the constitution ; where we need to have God is to acknowledge Him in our hearts; He dwells there in spite of us, but what is wanted is to become aware of it. And to that blessed consciousness none can awaken us so well as our parents; it is their duty, and they will per- form that great duty without having God in the constitution, which in fact is only put forth as a plea, but really aims as a stepping-stone to combine church and state. Expecting that some will imagine, froim several of the pas- sages in this book, that the author has a prejudice or malice against Catholics, he deems it proper to state that he har- bors no such feeling. Whateveir he has written he wrote froml pure motives, from pure love for his fellow-men. There are none who deserve the sympathy of every liberty-  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7121-00000125"/> loving man as much as the Catholic masses, who are en- slaved by priestcraft, which has been an obstacle to civiliza- tion; which has for centuries, and still does to a large extent, prevent good feeling and fellowship between man and man; which has and does prevent the Latin races from occupy- ing that glorious position in the onward march of an en- lightened civilization to which their physical and mental vigor entitles them. To emancipate the Catholics from priestcraft is a great and sublime duty; and those who suc- ceed in breaking those chains of oppression that now en- slave them and irritate the whole world, will deserve well of their fellow-men, and merit the great title of deliverers and citizens of the world.

NOW it is clear to me; now I fully comprehend why my good father so often came home from his busi- ness careworn, fatigued, complaining of headache, of pain in his chest, and great weakness in his knees; for the responsibilities of conducting successfully a business  are indeed great, and the disappointments and mortifi- cations one has to endure are many," said Charles Hunting, as he looked at a statement of outstanding debts; and he  continued: "Half of these claims are overdue, still I have the satis- faction of having done my duty in trying to collect them; but this is all the satisfaction that I have. Their promise to remit soon does not enlarge our bank account on which to draw, to meet our obligations with promptness. Let ne read again a few letters of to-day's mail ;" and the young merchant took one letter after another, and read: "MESSRS. EDWARD HUNTING &amp; SON: "GENTLEMEN .--Your letter reminding me that my ac- count is greatly overdue is received, and I confess that you ought to have your money, and the reason why I do not re- mit is because those owing me do not pay.

In the meantime, rest easy, and do not take me to be the nman against whose principle it is to pay interest, and against whose principle it is to pay his debts. You can charge the principal with interest, and you will find that I am faithful to  my principle to pay principal and interest when ready.

"I guess that Mr. Keep will keep all he can, and remain firn to his principle to pay principal and interest when ready. This will no doubt be when manna again falls down from  heaven. In the meantime, I will take proper steps and con- quer Julius Cesar Keep, or he will keep what by right be-  longs to our house." Indorsing the letter-"To be sued at  once," he took the next letter, and read: "MESSRS. EDWARD HUNTING &amp; SON:    I  "GENTLEMEN : -I owe you an apology for not having remitted when our bills became due. But the facts are, we were mud-boulnd; our county suffers under the disadvan- tage of not having good pikes; the people are in favor   l of having them made, but the opposition of Squire Caleb Rusha Titus is so great, and his influence so overwhelming,  that nearly every public measure is through him defeated. Such a wealthy man is a drawhack to the community; and if he should continue his opposition to having the necessary pikes built, and succeed in again defeating that laudible measure, I have concluded to move from this place. Can you inform me of some good point where I could settle with a fair prospect of success?

My affairs are in a more deplorable condition than 1 expected; my debts are $60o6.75, and my stock and fixtures, invoiced at cost, amount to $1961. 8. I have several thousand dollars in my book, but they are uncollectable. It seems nobody has any money except Squire Titus, and he has made the people of our county poor by the excessive rate of inter- est he charges; everybody is bitterly complaining. A spirit of illiberality prevails in the whole community. I am at my wits' end. Be as charitable to a broken-down man as you can. Should be pleased to know what you will do for me. "Truly yours, "TiHOMAS NIXDA.' "M[ESSRS. EDWARD HUNTING &amp; SON  "GENTLEMEN : -From the tenor of your letter, I judge you think I neglect you. You are entirely mistaken in that respect; for you are in my mind every day, as are all my creditors, and I regret to say that I am not able to give any of my creditors that which is justly their due at present, for I have been turned and sold out by a distress-warrant for rent. They made the levy, took all my stock and fixtures, not leaving me a row of pins or fifty cents in my pocket. I am heart-broken by the occurrence. I am nearly too old to be cast adrift in this way. Had it happened a few years back, I might have gotten over it a little easier; now I have not the energy I had then, and besides, it is the first time I have had the law, put in force during my life.  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7121-00000127"/> 252     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" "I have endeavored to find some employment of some kind, to give sustenance to my family, but have not suc- ceeded as yet. There are more clerks, book-keepers, rail- road drivers out of employment than there are places to  fill. "A friend trusted me with a small lot of goods to peddle with. I would walk for days at a time before I could sell a quarter's worth. I wore out more shoe leather than the whole profit would be to me. I do -not know as yet what will turn up next. My belief is, where there is such a long streak of lean, a streak of fat will surely come soon. If I am  able to hold out in strength, the will is good enough. If you can devise some means to help me, I would be thankful, so I can pay what I owe you and others. If I succeed in get- ting into business again, I will not fail to remember you and  my notes that remain unpaid. "With respect, ( remain yours, "P. L. OUT." With tears in his eyes, did the young merchant lay that letter aside, and said to himself, "This is man's destiny. If he is not industrious, prudent in his transactions, and care- ful of his expenditure, lie is in his old age turned out of house and home, and set adrift like a fallen autumn leaf, to be blown about by the slightest breeze, and trampled under the feet of the passing pedestrian. What a narrow escape had I from such a fate! If I had pursued the fast life with which I commenced my career, ruin must have been the consequence; to be the boon companion of idlers, gamblers, and wicked women who live on the earnings of others, who consumne their time in revelry, and annihilate their honor and the inheritance for which their ancestors have toiled and suffered. Deprivation is the high-road to perdition. It   OR,  UR DES TINY.       253 stands to reason that by the time I should have reached the age of fifty, nothing would have been left in my possession but a soiled character, infirmities, and bad habits, which make Of man an outcast, a burden on the cold clarities of the world. What a warning should this be to mle in the future! what a warning should this be to young and even old men! And to whom do Iowe this rescue from the path of vice? To Rosa- lind La Monte! Her rebuke has awakened in me the thought that I am a man-God's representative on earth, who has the great duty to perform, first to conquer himself, and then to conquerall the obstacles which are in his way. Maln's happiness is to utilize the very elements and make them sub- ordinate to man's will. This is our destiny. Such a man cannot be the companion of idlers, and stoop to the passion of the depraved." The office boy entered, and said, "Three gentlemen as a committee, wish 1me to ask you whether they can see you in your private office." Y'es, show them in," answered. Mr. Charles Hunting, dry- ing the tears which stood in his eyes. The gentlemen, on entering the office and exchanging the usual courtesies, stated that they had been appointed a com- rmittee to select several prominent gentlemen to deliver lectures on suitable subjects, before the Young /len's Chris- tian Association-; and they had unanimously resolved to in- vite Mr. Charles Hunting to deliver the opening lecture of the season, and they hoped he would accept the invita- tion. The young merchant blushed, and in a somewhat etmbar- rassed tone said, "Gentlemen, I consider it a very great honor, but I fear that J do not possess the ability to address so intelligent a body; 1 am only a plain mCechant, a matter-of- fact man, who speaks out his mind even if it gives offence to the offenders."  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7121-00000128"/> 254     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" "These are just the lectures which we like to inaugurate before the Young Men's Christian Association. There has been of late too much sophistry uttered, which has had a weakening tendency. We therefore desire to have this year's lectures of the clearest reasoning, with thel ring of genuine metal. Such a lecture we expect you will deliver. We promise, if you accept, to use our influence to secure a full house to greet you." "Gentlemen, I accept your kind invitation, and will do my best to realize your expectations. In a week from to-day I will be ready and at your service." The committee retired well pleased in having succeeded in enlisting the services of Mr. Charles Hunting for the great cause, "The Mental and Moral Elevation of the Young Men's Christian Association." The next morning the papers published the following ar- ticle: '"We are glad to announce that the committee on lectures before the Young Men's Christian Association have suc- ceeded in inducing Mr. Charles Hunting to deliver a lecture before that interesting body. The lecture will be delivered on Wednesday next, at the hall of the association, and it can be fairly expected that every young man of the asso- ciation, and many of the most prominent merchants, bankers, lawyers, and doctors will attend the lecture, to hear what a practical business man has to say to our rising generation." None read that short paragraph with a deeper emotion than Miss Rosalind La Monte. Tears of joy stood in her eyes, and she exclaimed : "That Charley has been invited to deliver a lecture be- fore the Young Men's Christian Association proves conclu- sively that he has completely reformed; and furthermore,   or, OUR DESTINY.        "55 shows that he has passed his leisure time in reading good books, and storing his mind with knowledge. This is indeed good news; it indicates that my riding by the side of Count Carl Von Mardeck did not shake his resolution to reform. But does he still love me?" and with those words her hands fell into her lap, and she seemed lost in deep reverie, from which the feeble voice of her father recalled her: "Daughter! Rosalind! daughter!" "I am coming, pig am coniZn." And the young Iastened to her father, who, wan and almost hopeless, lay on his bed. "' Stay in this room, for I feel very, very lonely. How slow and heavy pass the hours! When I was well, and at my post in the bank, the hours seemed to glide like so many min- utes. How impatient I was when some one tarried a few mo- ments longer than was actually necessary. Then I called such men bores. Now I would rejoice if they would come and chat in order to while away the time, but none come to see me : my selfishness has cost me their friendship." "Pa, please do not talk, for you know that Doctor Dett- man forbade you to speak more than was actually necessary." "Yes, Doctor Dettman even forbids me to reflect on any- thing. 'Be calm, be calm; callness will cure quicker than any medicine which I can prescribe.' Those have been his words for the last fourteen weeks, and here I am still in my bed, hardly able to lift a limb ; none who knew me in my youth would now recognize me as John James La Monte, who was blooming with health and energy. I was then poor, very poor; but gladly would I exchange my opulence for my former health. ,Then life was a pleasure ; it was a life of joy, with hope before me. Now life is fill of pain ; it is a burden, with hope behind me." The ailing man could say no more, for poignant grief overpowered him; and he wept.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7121-00000129"/> 256     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" "Father!" exclaimed Rosalind, " your words and grief  distress me. Why say that you leave hope behind? 'Hope'  is the greatest treasure that man possesses, and woe is unto  those who have lost ' hope.' I beg you, my dear father, to I hope; hope that God is with you now, and ever will be with ! you ; through His grace you will recover complete health; through His grace poor Viola will recover her reason, and then we shall be once more a happy fanily. Alas, one will be missing to make up the happy g rp." "And that is-?" asked Mr. La' int e eagerly. Mrs. Wehlen ; she is no more among the living," said Rosalind sadly. "And," she concinuted, "a day after Viola's arrival at home, I read under the heading'Deaths' -' Wehlen. On the twenty-fifth inst., after'a short but painful illness, in the, forty-eighth year of her age, BRIDGET T. \WEHLEN. The funeral will take place on Sunday, the twenty-eighth, froim her late residence, 200 Rox Street. Friends are in- vited without further notice.' "Your severe illness and Viola's distressing state of mind made it impossible for me to attend the funeral, and ma would not attend. That Sunday afternoon, a hearse and a single carriage passed our house on its way to the cemetery. In the carriage sat Otto Wehlen, her son, the only mourner of that truly good woman. I thought'that my heart would break at that sight." "This explains why Otto never called to see me during my sickness; he must feel greatly offended that none of our family attended the funeral of his mother," observed Mr. La Monte, "There is no doubt he does, and justly so; still, I hope when he knows all the circumstances he will readily excuse our non-attendance." A gentle knock was heard at the door. Rosalind an- swered, "Walk in."   OR, OUR DESTINY.        257 Dr. Dettman entered, and after exchanging the usual saluta- tions, proceeded to examine the pulse of the patient, and said, "The symptoms are favorable; you need not take any more medicine. I recommiend you to keep as quiet as possible; drink three or four times a day good beef soup, and eat young chicken stewed, for dinner ; sip from time to time some of the best Rhine wine ; you may now read the newspapers for an hour during the day, and keep yourself otherwise pleasantly occupied; for instance, to cut off coupons, which are due and are promptly paid, is a pleasant occu- pation, especially for a banker," concluded the doctor, good- naturedly. Mr. La Monte smiled approvingly, and asked, "Doctor, how is Viola?" "She is doing splendidly; she is docile. What she now must have is plenty of exercise. Rosalindchen, you must manage to ride in the carriage or on horseback every pleasant day with your sister. I prefer horseback ; ride at a canter, but not a gallop. Amuse your sister as much as you can. If her language is occasionally incoherent, do not cor- rect her, for that Iimay irritate her. By all means let her have plenty of exercise, and she will then sleep refreshingly. Healthful sleep is nature's sweet restorer." "I will gladly execute your orders, and will do almost anything to see my sister restored to health," said Rosalind. "This is natural, and especially with you, Rosalindchen; and as you are such a good daughter, so attentive a sister, and so excellent a young lady, I have brought you something which I know will delight you, and I think it will also please your father;" and Dr. Dettman drew from his breast coat- pocket a neatly folded newspaper, and after changing his spectacles, he read the paragraph referring to Mr. Charles Hunting's lecture. Rosalind blushed deeply, and a happy light shone from  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7121-00000130"/> 258     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" her brilliant eyes, which both the father and Dr. Dettman noticed. "Did I not bring you something delightful?"' asked the good old doctor in a happy tone. "I read that article already this morning," answered Ro- salind, still blushing.      I You did? Well, I am glad that you did; but it spoiled the joy which I felt in bringing it to your notice. Charley is now a very fine gentleman; a year ago I had fears that he would turn out badly; that he would be a regular repro- bate; instead of that, he is now a model young man. 'he whole family, in fact, has changed." Mrs. Ia Monte, dressed in deep mourning, pale and care- worn, now entered the room, with a book on spiritualism in her hand. She took a seat near the bed, mute as a sphinx. Dr. Dettman made a pleasant bow to the lady, and con- tinued: "What did I say? That he would be a regular repro- bate; instead of which, he is now a model young man. The whole family has changed. Mrs. Edward Hunting, the proud, arrogant Mrs. Hunting who used to be, is now humble and obliging. There is not a charitable institution in the city in which she does not take an active interest. Of the friendless,' she is the special patron; she has to my knowl- edge placed fifty of the friendless in different parts of the country among families who have undertaken to keep their past life a secret, and assist them again to walk in the path of virtue and honorable usefulness. To accomplish that within one year requires herculean exertion. This is what I call true missionary work-not among the savages on the plains, but among us, who became savage through the extreme selfishness and perfidy of men. All praise is due to Mrs. Ed- ward Hunting for her great efforts to rescue the unforti- nate;" and the doctor continued: "You know the grandfather, Zadock Hunting? He is un-   OR, OUR DESTINY.        259 doubtedly the happiest man in our city; for within a week. he became the great-grandfather of five great-grandsons: Mrs. Wilkins one, Mrs. Overbeck and Mrs. Fastleben had each of them a son, and Mrs. Augustus Hunting gave birth last night to two bouncing boys. I officiated at the grand event, and am heartily glad that all passed off well. Mrs. Hunting behaved under the trying circumstances cour- ageously, but her husband, Captain Hunting, behaved like a coward. He wrung his hands, pulled his beard, bit his fingers, and continually kept saying, ' Doctor, you have my life in your hands.' He made me almost nervous, and I or- dered him out of the house." "I can imagine how you showed him the door," said Mrs. La Monte, with a sarcastic smile. "I will be obeyed, or my services cannot be obtained," re- marked the doctor promptly. "By the bye, do you know the brother of Mrs. Augustus Hunting, the Count Carl Von Mardeck?" "Yes, we know him well: he is a frequent visitor at our house," answered Mrs. La Monte. "Yesterday he received a peremptory order from the German Emperor to immediately come to Berlin and report before his Majesty. Fifteen minutes after he received the message he was on his way home. He is a splendid young man, a marvellous pianist. I regret that none of our young ladies captivated him; such a man is-quite an acquisition to society. I like to see men of such sterling qualities domes- ticated : it improves the tone of society. I am sorry that we have lost him," said the doctor earnestly. Mrs. La Monte looked at Rosalind, and remarked, ' I have done my best to see him married to one of our most accomplished young ladies, but the young lady would not heed my advice, and now he is gone, perhaps never to re- turn."  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7121-00000131"/> 260     "THE FORGIVING KISS;"            The doctor took the book from Mrs. La Monte's hands, looked at the title, and, shrugging his shoulders, said, "' Mrs.  La Monte, as a friend 1 advise you not to read books  [I of such a nature. Why keep your thoughts occupied with the  spiritual world, -when there is so much around us in the I physical which demands our careful attention, and so richly . rewards our investigations. The earth and all there is in it, on it, and abov e it, belongs to man, and is within the reach i of his intelligence; what is beyond. it is also beyond his comprehension. To study the spiritual world is a waste of  time which leads to no individual or social benefits; if any- thing it is a disadvantage, for it deprives that individual who thus wastes his time, of acquiring useful information - which would add to general knowledge. I have known men  and women who, before they became imbued with spirit-  { ualism, were sound thinkers and able workers,. but who be-  came incapable of performing intelligently the plainest du- ties of life. Their thoulglts were so enthralled with spiritual speculations that they seemed no longer to walk on earth,  but to float in the air, whirled to and fro by their unearthly  reflection, following a shadow until they became a shadow  of their former selves. If you value your peace of mind,  cease to read such books and avoid spiritualism in all its  forms: it leads to unhtlppy results."  "Thanks for your advice, but I find it a very interesting i study," answered Mrs. La Monte.  "All studies are more or less interesting, but the mind . must be, so to say, braced up to them, in order to arrive } at some satisfactory conclusions. Your mind has not been braced up to study. Through fortunate circumstances you enjoyed all the benefits that humanity ha's stored up from time immemiorial without the least exertion on your part to enlarge its benefits. I am, however, glad to perceive that you desire to store your mind with knowledge, and then, if   OR, OUR DESTINY.        261 possible, add to the general stock of information; but I re- gret that you have taken up the study of spiritualism, which is at best only a speculative theme; its phenomena cannot be positively explained by the human mind." "What study would you recommend me, doctor?" asked Mrs. La Monte condescendingly. "The study of human nature; not only through prose or poetry, but by mingling with humanity-and by that I mean all classes and all ages-to bend down to listen to their woes, and often to their tales or myths, to their genuine and borrowed troubles. It will give you an insight into human nature, into the trials of humanity, its hopes and disappoint- ments, its joys and its sorrows, its true nobility and pitiful meanness. And you will leave your field of observation with the firm conviction that the cause of all misfortune to hu- manity is 'ignorance and indolence.' To remove those causes will be the aim of your life. It is a worthy aim for a lady of your wealth." The doctor paused, took out his watch, looked at the time and said, "I must be off." "Doctor, please remain yet awhile; your-presence makes me feel better," begged Mr. La Monte. "If you will keep quiet, and let nothing worry you, you will soon be able to leave your room. I would gladly pro- long my stay, but I have many calls to make." With a very courteous bow the able doctor left the room. Stepping into his carriage, he said, "Mrs. Wehlen has cor- rectly informed me that Mrs. La Monte tried her best to marry Rosalind to the Count Carl Von Mardeck. Failing in that, she almost forcibly took Viola to her house with the idea of bringing about a divorce between her and her husband, and then mlarrying Viola to the Count. I could not at first bring my mind to believe it; but from what I have of late seen of Mrs. La Monte, it is not only possible, but very  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7121-00000132"/> 262     "THE FORGIVING KISS;"  probable. There is a new danger threatening this house. The mystic speculations of spiritualism, with its long train of shams and humbugs, will entice Mrs. La Monte into an ocean of trouble. I must see Otto Wehlen this evening; he must become reconciled with that family, and again live with his wife. This will rescue the family from an ocean of misery, and perhaps restore Viola to her reason. It is a great task, but I must not shrink from my duties, for I am a servant of humanity, and to serve humanity well is to please God. It is the essence of religion; it is true reverence for 'the Great Spirit."' i .   OR, OUR DESTINY.        23 CHAPTER X. Rising in clouded majesty, at length Apparent Queen, unveiled her peerless liglt, And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw. MLTON. "ARGE city, with its streets systematically laid out in every direction, with its gas lamps at every one hundred and fifty feet distance, stretching out for miles, all lit in the evening, is a pleasing sight to an observ- ing eye; and if the air is balmy and the sky is illuminated by a full moon and bright, twinkling stars, the scene is truly charming, and many are the toilers who work either men- tally or physically who avail themselves of such a paradise, loving the evening for a walk and a chat with a worthy friend. Such was the evening when the industrious and faithful Doc- tor Dettman gently urged his trusty but soiewhat tired horse on his way to Rox Street. He met many carriages and pedestrians, who drove and walked in the same direc- tion, and the doctor mused, "Rox Stre'et is no longer the un- known and the lonely street; Rox Street is now well known in all the literary and cultivated circles. The home of Mr. Otto Wehlen, on Rox Street, is now the centre of the highest culture. Most of those people I met'are no doubt going to spend the evening at Mr. Wehlen's, where literary works, science, art, religion, and progress will be analyzed and commented on in a masterly manner." - The doctor ol entering the house found it brilliantly lighted, comfortably heated by steam, and a bright fire in the grates added to the charm of a well-regulated house. All the rooms of the house were open, and many eminent men who made  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7121-00000133"/> 264     "T HE FOR GVING KISS;" their mark in their respective professions were already there, and coming in quick succession. All were pleasantly re- ceived by the host.  "Doctor, I am very happy to see you. This is my reception night when my friends honor me, with a visit, and we pass  the evening in exchanging views. I have no doubt that youl  can and will enlighten us," said Otto Wehlen with great  politeness.                         I "I am glad that my visit affords you pleasure. I heard of the social gatherings at your house, and with your permission will remain for a while, and add all I can to its pleasures." j Mr. Wehlen made a graceful bow, and hastened to receive - a very dear friend whom he cordially greeted and said, 9 Gen- tlemen, I have the great honor of introducing to you my  friend, Mr. Julius Solomon, who only a few weeks ago ar-  rived from Paris, and gave me one of his historical pictures which I will, with your leave, present for a very critical in- spection."  These remarks were warmly received, and Mr. Julius Sol- omon was soon surrounded by many of the gentlemen present, who knew him by his reputation as a great painter' of portraits, landscapes, and battle-fields. Precisely at nine o'clock, the host opened the piano, and Mr. Solomon, who, by the way, is called by his friends "The sweet singer of Israel," sang a song. The words were composed by Doctor Wise, and the music by Professor Carl Barus: I - t   OR, OUR DESTINrY.  265 IMMORTAL LIFE.

Every one present so deeply admired both the words and music, that Mr. SoloIon was induced to sing another can- ticle, written and composed by the same authors: "The Lord is merciful. O Saul, in him rejoice, Lift up with songs and psalms To Him the grateful voice; His mercies never fail. All hail, my soul, all haiL Hallelujah!   OR, OUR DESTINY.        269 Mr. Solomon sang with feeling and sweetness. The ap- plause was hearty, and all requested a repetition; and many quickly mastered the refrain, and sang the chorus. Even the doctor, whose ear for music h4d been, in consequence of his medical studies and great practice, neglected, felt the inspiration, and hummed the tune with the rest. The piece was pronounced good church music, and suitable to the feelings of those who have lost a-relative or a friend,--and who is there, that has not felt such a loss? After several other pieces had been played and sung, Mr. Wehlen invited his guests to an adjoining room, to examine the latest production of hs beloved friend, Mr. Julius Solo- mon. On entering the room, the guests beheld a large painting on an easel, the gaslight properly placed and adjusted. "Gentlemen," exclaimed Otto, "you see before you the battle-field of Gravelotte." All stood awe-struck by the grandeur of the picture; for miles could the field be seen covered with thousands of slain soldiers and horses, with ghastly wounds and the agony of death distinctly stamped upon their features; here and there was seen, in a, kneeling position, a nurse, with the red cross of Geneva on the right arm, examining the wounded to see whether all were indeed dead, or whether some could not be even yet recalled to life by human aid. In the cen- tre of the awful battle-field stood a prominent and manly figure, with paper and pencil in hand, writing quickly down the impression that the heart-rending scene made on his quick, comprehending mind. He looked like a hero who was determined to do his whole duty. "Whom does that man with paper and pencil represent?" asked Dr. Dettman of the artist. "He represents the press; he was the only man from that fraternity present, and from what I have learned, I  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7121-00000136"/> 270     c"TlE FORGIVING KITSS;"  judge that he left the comforts of an affectionate home, and crossed the ocean in order to give a true account of a great war to the millions of readers of his journal. Was he not a hero, worthy to occupy the position I gave him in my pic- ture?" All agreed that he deserved the honor, and ought to be  known as the "Hero of Gravelotte." "Place the Quill before the Hero, and you will have it nearly right," observed the doctor good-naturedly. "But apart from this, I for one pronounce the picture a great artistic success; it appeals to us in unmistakable language- "et there be no more war.'  "Let there be no more war!" exclaimed all in one accord, and the party left the room, and were conducted by the host to the dining-hall, where they took their seats before a well-spread table for supper. "I like the' expression so enthusiastically uttered, 'Let there be no more war.' But what must be done in order to avoid war?" asked Mr. Wehlen.  All looked at Dr. Dettman, as if it were expected that he  should answer that question.  '"In order to avoid war, we must place men in power who have the capacity to conquer themselves, and also to educate the masses to live peaceably-to value peace as one of man's dearest possessions." "Doctor, please give us your views on education," was the earnest request of several gentlemen. The doctor hesitated; but the request being general, he finally consented to utter his views on education. An en- terprising reporter being present, quickly took notes on the cuffs of his shirt, and the next morning thousands of readers read the following interesting paragraph:   OR, OUR DESTINY.        27 27! "A SAGE'S VIEWS ON EDUCATION. "Last evening there was another gathering of the most prominent gentlemen of the bar, the press, the medical and scientific departments, at the residence of Mr. Otto Wehlen, on Rox Street, assembled to discuss, tete-a-tete, the great questions of the day. Doctor Dettman, being requested to give his views on education, substantially said: That obser- vation had convinced him that out of a hundred parents there are only ten who have the capacity to bring up chil- dren properly; and out of a hundred families there are not more than twenty whose example before their children is what it should be. The crime and misery of men and women could be directly traced to the ignorance that pre- vailed in their parental homes, and also because they have in their childhood acquired all those bad habits which are detrimental to a pure and successful life. "And how could it be otherwise, when whole families are found dwelling in one or two rooms; when the father, and in many cases the mother too, must leave the children to themselves, while they go forth to earn the necessaries of life,-and their compensation is barely sufficient to buy clothing to cover the nakedness of themselves and their children, and to feed them? Discontent rules supreme in such a home, and discontent is the mother of strife that be- gins between husband and wife, and scenes are enacted in the presence of children which leave such an impress on their minds as is never effaced, and which they often imi- tate themselves. On the other hand, there are families of great wealth, who in their opulence become overbearing, and their children lean so much upon them as a prop that they become vain and helpless creatures. To draw the line in order to prevent extreme poverty and extreme  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7121-00000137"/> 272     "TIE F ORIGIVING KISS;"  wealth, and to educate the rising generation properly, is the momentous question. "To my mind," continued the doctor, "it is clear that nothing will solve this problem so quickly and satisfactorily as universal education. . I claim that if the State has a right to draft the best manhood for military purposes, the same State must have the right to educate the youth for the arts of peace. Now I propose so to legislate, that all children must attend public schools from the ages of six to nine years, in their respective school districts; after they reach the age of nine years they are to be examined by a medical board, and all who are found to be in a healthy state shall receive their State uniform, be formed into companies, and every Monday morning march-not ride-to the railroad depot, from whence they are to be sent out into the country to the school grounds, which shall be away from the city, away from towns. These grounds shall be ample and suf- ficient for the erection of comfortable school and dwelling rooms for the children and teachers, where the children shall not only be educated in all the arts known to us, but they must also be brought up to wait on themselves. Every boy and every girl must in succession prepare food for the company of which they form a part; they must makle up  their own beds; they must keep their rooms in order ; they must mend their own clothes. "They are to remain away from home from Monday until Friday evening. On Saturday and Sunday they are to be under the care of their parents, to receive religious in- struction. When at home they can dress ii such costume as their parents choose, but on Monday they must again be clothed in the dress furnished by the State. This course shall continue until they reach the age of fifteen, wlhen they are to be at liberty to enter into active life. This plan would accomplish the following results: first, it will give the   bR, OUR DESTINY.        273 poor man a chance to save something from his earnings, as his children would be clothed by the State from the age of nine up to fifteen, and the whole aim of the family would be to have a more comfortable dwelling,-for it is natural that the children, having been out in the country dwelling in airy rooms, would urge on their parents the necessity of having more. comfortable dwellings,-and with comfortable dwell- ings, the first step has been taken to improve the morals of the family. The second great result of this plan of educa- tion would be that the vanity of dress would receive a death-blow: the State, having to dress the children from the age of nine up to fifteen, would endeavor to teach the rising generation to dress comfortably, without the present mode of trinkets, tight lacing, and tight and thin shoes, which un- dermine so fearfully the health of thousands. "It would also have taught them to be self-relying and honorable in their conduct. With the increase of intelli- gence and good habits crime and misery will decrease. "As regards the expense of keeping up such universal education in that manner," the doctor remarked, " it should be obtained by taxation; and also half of the estate which has been left by those who died without issue in wedlock should belong to the State, and be appropriated for educa- tionaI purposes; the other half shall be divided among the nearest relatives. "Taxation for educational purposes, and divisions of the. estate of those who died childless, would have a tendency to increase wealth for the benefit of the many in which all would share. "Such universal education would make intelligence gen- eral. It would vastly improve the race physically, morally, and mentally. We would then have men and women, and not, as we now  have in many instances, drones and dressed-up dolls."  12*  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7121-00000138"/> 274     ' THE FORGIVING KISS;" The remarks of the doctor Were, well received, and he was requested to write an essay on that great subject. "Alone! I am again alone, and feel lonely and deso- late," said Mr. Otto Wehlen after his friends departed; and he continued to soliloquize: c; I am indeed alone: my good mother is dead; my father I have never known; I never had sister or brother; I never have felt the greetings of a single relative. Strangers court my friendship, but a rela- tive has never as yet announced himself to me. I am alone and lonely. My wife, poor Viola, how much I miss her! Gladly would I follow the advice of that noble Dr. Dettman, and become reconciled with her and her family, but I can- not: I have been too deeply wounded. They have shortened the days of my good mother; they would not attend even her funeral. It was the duty of Viola to remain with me and try the home I have provided; it was the duty of Mrs. La Monte to leave us to manage our own affairs. They have with their acts taken fate into their own hands; let them abide the consequences. But what will be my fate? To remain alone? Alone! What a sad word! What a sad fact to be alone! This is not man's destiny.  Our destiny is not to be alone; it is destined that we  { should be wedded and live in happy harmony with ourselves - and the rest of mankind, and those who fail to fulfil this  destination must feel the bitterness of solitude and dreary loneliness." He paused, and walked up and down the room, in deep meditation. "Yes," exclaimed he, " it is not the fault of Viola, or the fault of Mrs. La Monte, or the manner in which they have behaved: it is the fault of their education, the fault of our social organization. Had Viola received a training as Doctor Dettman's plan proposes, she would not now be a mere vain and helpless creature, but a woman of sense, a true helpmate. The estate of old Mr. i'   OR, OUR DESTINY.        275 Bottwell would not have been as large, perhaps; the high taxation for educational purposes would have reduced it sonewhat; still it would have saved his daughter from being the vain and purse-proud woman who has made life to all those who came in contact with her almost unbearable, and made her wealth the objective point of all sorts of schemers. Far better would it have .been for the family if they had less wealth, and more practical knowledge and good com- mon-sense. The more I reflect on the subject, the clearer it appears to me that neither Mrs. La Monte nor her daughter are to be blamed for their action toward me; they are the victims of an unfortunate social organization and education. Dr. Dettman is quite right, and it is my duty to become reconciled to the family, and to exert my best efforts to remove erroneous impressions from their minds, and lead them on the path of enlarged charity, and make of them angels instead of demons." With these words, the young husband took up the evening journal, saying, "I cannot retire before, reading at least the telegraphic news." The htrad-lines attracted his attention: "Another Great 'Disaster at Sea ; A Steamer wrecked. Two HLundred Lives saved through the Heroic Conduct of a Lady, Mrs. Idat Lothimore " Mrs. Ida Lothimore!" exclaimed Mr. Wehlen. "It is the same name my noble mother uttered in her dying moments, pointing at the same time to her wedding-ring. Mrs, Ida Lothimore must know something about my mother's marriage. Dr. Dettman has also asked me whether I knew a lady named Ida Lothimore. The doctor behaves as if he knew the history of my parents, which so deeply concerns me, and he is no doubt gathering all the facts be- fore he relates them to me. But what about Mrs. Ida "Lothimore? Let me carefully read the article which de- clares her heroism." And Mr. Wehlen read;  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7121-00000139"/> 276     "THE FORGIVING IVG SS;" "The fast and elegantly fitted-up steamer, 'The Con-  queror of the Waves,' of the Make or Break Line, sprung a leak at sea near one of the islands that dot the Pacific Ocean. The captain and the crew made hardly any efforts  to save the steamer, and as soon as she began to sink they rushed to the life-boats, and left the passengers to the ten- der mercies of the waves. The cowardly conduct of the captain and crew caused a panic among th* passengers, which was fortunately quieted by the great energy of a lady passenger, Mrs. Ida Lothimore. She assumed command, placed men and women energetically to work at the pumps, and set to work to find the extent of the damage and to stop the break, in which, happily, she partly succeeded. The minute guns were fired, which attracted the attention of the islanders, who came in their canoes to the rescue of the  endangered passengers. Every one of them was safely brought to land before the steamer went to the bottom. The king of the islanders being a former school-fellow, of Mrs. Ida Lothimore, they were on that account kindly treated by the tribe. A passing vessel was hailed; which brought all the passengers, including the king of the islanders, to Halifax. Grateful thanks are due to the heroic lady, and also to the islanders, for the timely services thus rendered." I will with the first train start for Halifax, and try to ascertain what Mrs. Ida Lothimore knows- of my parents. There seems to be some strange mystery connected with it, which I am bound to unravel. But what am I saying? I to leave the city, and thus leave the bank without a respon- sible head! I cannot do it until the president of the bank is again at his post: then only can I fairly ask and expect leave of absence. But in the meantime, Mrs. Ida Lothi- more may start for parts-unknown," thought Mr. Wehlen. I-e paused and listened to the following song, which a few of his friends sang as a serenade:   OR, OUR DESTNY.            2" FORGET ME NOT.- Blossoms more rich and rare than thou May twine round Beauty's graceful brow In moods of sunny mirth; The rose's or the myrtle's flower Might more beseem her festive hour, And give, in Pleasure's careless bower, To brighter fancies birth. But in those moments, sad, yet dear, When parting wakes Affection's tear, Thy stainless blossom's braid, Whose name forbids us to forget, Would be the chosen coronet Love on the loveliest brow would set To crave fond Memory's aid.

H. G. ADAM. When they finished, Mr. Wehlen said: "I recognize  among the serenaders the voice of my noble friend, Julius Solomon. I will request him to go to Halifax and see Mrs. Ida Lothimore, and try to ascertain all he can in regard to my family history." He invited the serenaders in, and before they parted Mr. Julius Solomon gladly promised to comply with the request of his friend, saying, "I will do my best to discover all the facts which you are naturally enough so anxious to learn. To-morrow morning I will start by the first train, and will travel anywhere to see Mrs. Ida Lothimore, and advise you by telegraph op the results of my labor.

CHAPTER XL. HE Sabbath is joyfully hailed by all those who toil hard for life. To them it is a day of rest, and to those who are religiously inclined it is a double pleasure-a day of rest, recreation, and mental elevaTion. Nowhere else did man and beast long so much for the Sabbath day as at the farm of Caleb Rusha Titus. Sc(qire Titus believed in work, in hard work, from sunrise until sun- set. He kept his men and beasts steadily at work, and as l;e believed in the principle that " a master's eye can do more work than his hands," he himself did not work, but saw that others did it with might and main. His farm was very large, and in the highest state of cultivation. He was wealthy, very wealthy; still none envied him his wealth or respectcd  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7121-00000143"/> 284      THE FORGIVING KISS; " him for it, for the largest part of his possessions was ob- tained through the nisfortune of others, and that misfortune was brought about through his agency. All who knew Caleb Rusha Titus agreed that for evcry dollar he possessed there was an agonizing tear pressed from his victims. Some  even asserted that his wealth was blood-stained; but this  : assertion found few believers, although they thought it   I strange that all his sisters and an only brother either died or  disappeared, and he became thus sole heir of their estates. It was strange, but perhaps it was strange through natural  causes. Squire Titus was greedy and very envious. He  was ambitious to possess the adjoining farms, and would offer an unreasonably low price for them. His neighbors,  knowing that he coveted their acres, would ask an unrea-  sonably high price, and this kindled the spark of dislike, which gradually grew into hate and uncompromising enmity.  i Squire Titus would then pick up some quarrel, and sue and  appeal the case from court to court, in order to harass his neighbors with lawsuits, who thus expended their savings for lawyers' fees, and through discouragement often became drunkards, mortgaged their farms, which he quietly bought  i up and foreclosed on the unfortunate debtor. This was his  mode of operating, and in that manner he absorbed many farms that adjoined his own. There was one neighbor, however, whom Squire Titus could not oust from his farm, either by a direct purchase at a fair price, or by a quarrel. He had failed to worry his less wealthy neighbor out of his farm. He consulted  his lawyers and asked how it could be made possible to get  Deacon William Fraazer into a lawsuit and into trouble, in  order to enable him to buy his farm. The accommodating  lawyers visited the premises, and to their great delight ob-  served a small stream, which was the dividing line between the two farms. Deacon Fraazer's cows drank of the limpid'  t   OR, OUR DESTINY.        285 water; a naughty bull jumped about and kicked the fence down. Here was a chance for a lawsuit. In the first place, they said the cattle of Deacon Fraazer had no right to drink of that stream, as more than seven-eighths of the water ran through Squire Titus's land; and then the repairs of the fence were to be paid also by Deacon Fraazer, and he was at once sued.  Deacon Fraazer hitched up his horses and went to the city and engaged one of the most eloquent lawyers, who had also the merit of not being bought up by his opponent, as is often the case among gentlemen of the robe, who, under the plea, ".what one hand receives, the other need not know," take fees from both parties. The case attracted general attention. The court-room was crowded to listen to the pleadings of the eminent law- yers. Of course the sympathy was with Farmer Fraazer, and when the city lawyer commenced to plead, a death-like silence prevailed. He reviewed the whole case in such a clear, logical manner, that he convinced the court that Farmer Fraazer's cattle had a right to drink of the passing streaml; and as regards the fence, that it should be kept in repair at an equal cost to the owners adjoining it. "But," said he, "your Honor will permit me to enlarge my argu- ment and endeavor to arrive at the motives of this litigation." And the city lawyer enlarged on the motives of Squire Titus in bringing the suit: it was covetousness. The fervent eloquence of the great advocate had its effect with the audience and the court, and when the attorney took his seat he was rewarded with an applause which made the house tremble to its very foundation. The judge said, with great dignity, that if. this were repeated he would cause the hall to be cleared. As for the case, lie would take it under advisement, and declare his decision the next day at ,1100"  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7121-00000144"/> 286      TIlE FORGIVIJNG KISS;" Long before the hour arrived,- the court was full to over- flowing to hear the judge's decision; and when he took his seat and delivered his opinion, silence and the utmost atten- tion prevailed. The judge, after reviewing the whole case, declared in  favor of the defendant, each to pay his own costs. It was the first time that Squire Titus was defeated in his designs upon his neighbor's farm, and henceforth the enmity  between the two farmers was as intense as the feud of the Capulets and Montagues at Verona. Although Farmer Fraazer managed to keep his farm, and enjoyed his triumph and the congratulations of friends, he, nevertheless, paid dearly for it, as the fee of his lawyer was very large. But he reasoned: "A farmer has to work a year to earn as much as that lawyer did in one day; my son shall also be a lawyer." But Mrs. Fraazer did not want her son to be a lawyer; their ancestors were all farmers, had lived and died honorable men; why should Andrew now go out of the beaten track? A lawyer may be good enough for those who have inherited nothing of their parents but mother-wit: they had notIing to lose and all to gain; but this was not the case with their son. Andrew would inherit a good farm; and if he till that farm, it will keep him and his in comfort, and shield them from want. What more does a man want? Honors? Those he can have as a farmer, if he- has ability to attain them, and if not able, he had better remain quietly on his farm. She disliked lawyers; they were men, learned, not how to observe the law, but how to avoid it; they brought men into trouble. "There would not  be half the lawing if there were not so many lawyers." Her son should not be a lawyer with her consent.  Determined opposition on one side often excites deter-  mined opposition on the other; and this was the case be- tween Mr. and Mrs. Fraazer. The peace of the family was - '    .1-   OR, OUR DESTINY.       287 gone, and finally, in order to show that he was the master of, the house, Mr. William Fraazer took his son to the city, placed him in a boarding-house where students from other parts of the country boarded, and sent him to college with a view to becoming an attorney at law. The son liked the change. To be away from home, fiee of the restraining hand, suited his disposition, and in that re- spect :he found plenty of companions among his fellow-stu- dents. The only difference was that many of his college mates had no money, and his father supplied him liber- ally, and Andrew spent it freely; so much so, that the money which his kind-hearted father sent was not sufficient, and he commenced to contract debts to be liquidated when he became possessed of his estate. Squire Titus advanced the money through his agents for the young man, and was happy with the thought of possessing Famler Fraazer's farm in a not distant future. Squire Titus had an only daughter, and Mrs. Titus in- sisted on sending her daughter to the city to complete there her education, and. if possible to form some desirable ac- quaintance, as there was not one. young man in the whole county who was equal to her in wealth. In this the squire fully agreed, and thus Miss Susan was sent to a young ladies' in- stitute in the city to complete her education. Young Fraazer, learning of her presence in the city, made it a point to make a friendly visit to his former neighbor. If their parents had difficulties, there was no earthly reason why they themselves should not be on amicable terms. Miss Susan shared the same opinion. The time passed on, their friendship ripened into love, and on the same day that Andrew Fraazer was admitted to the bar, he proposed, and was accepted-provided " pa and ma consent." But pa and ma did not consent, took their daughter home, and instead of treating her kindly and trying to wean her  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7121-00000145"/> 288     "T7HE FORGIVING z  "KISS; "  away from her unfortunate choice, they treated her harshy and ridiculed her lover, which had the effect of imaiing her home unpleasant, and doubly endeared her lover, who thus gained complete control over her. Filial ties were disre- garded, and she eloped, married the penniless lawyer, who was poor in purse and poor in brain, which last was already affected by fast life and bad habits. Squire Titus was r aving mad. He solemnly swore to  disown his daughter, and to shoot Andrew Fraazer whenever he came near his house. His trusty rifle was loaded and ready to execute his terrible threat, and those who knew, Squire Titus felt certain that he would shoot his son-in-law at sight, no matter what the consequences might be. The daughter and son-in-law never ventured to appear before their parents, and struggled on to support themselves the best way they could. Mr. and Mrs. William Fraazer died heart-broken. Their farm was now within reach of Squire Titus; in fact he held the notes that the heir had given him in anticipation of pos- sessing it, and that heir, who through his agency became a libertine, was now his son-in-law. The thoughts were mad- dening ; it was a wound that cut to the quick ; it embittered existence. No wonder that Caleb R. Titus had no desire to possess it there it remained in strange contrast to his own farm. Mrs. Titus exerted herself to plead before her stern husband to forgive their daughter, and for her sake to for- give Andrew Fraazer, and receive him into the family, to which the squire replied, "Never! never , If my life were ebbing away, and I could save it by again recognizing Mrs. Susan Fraazer as my daughter, I would rather die than do so. 1 am firm and resolute never to recognize my daughter, and am resolved to kill Andrew Fraazer whenever he comes within rifle-shot of my house."  The unhappy wife and mother knew her husband too well   OR, OUR DESTINY.        289 not to be aware that hie would not change from his fixed resolution,'and daily she walkcd miles to the post-office, to see if a letter were not there from her darling daughter; but Squire Titus took good care that if a letter arrived it should not be delivered to his wife. The letters of his unfortunate daughter fell into his hands, and the more she lamented, the more the hard hearted and close-fisted man enjoyed the situation; but Mrs. Titus persisted in going to the .post-of- fice : it was her only hope. Years passed on, and she received no letter froim her only child, which began seriously to undermine her health and mind. In a moment of liberality her husbalnd brought home a parrot; Mrs. Titus made a pet of it, and taught it to say, "Susan, come home; mother wants you." And between going to the post-office to see whether there were a letter from Susan, and attending to the bird, Mrs. Titus passed her time. Squire Titus hated the parrot, and kept away from the room as much as possible; but on Sundays he could not avoid being in the house. It took him longer to. dress, and he remained longer at the table than usual, ald all that time he had to healr, "Susan, come home ; mother wants you." "That bird annoys me," would be the. casual expression of Squire Titus. "I wish some one would come and steal it, or that it would die." To which Mrs. Titus would reply, Caleb, don't deny me the only pleasure that I have left on earth." Yes," answered the husband, it may be a pleasure to you to hear continually, ' Susan, come home; mother wants you,' but to me it is all gall and wormwood. I wish that bird were dead!" Every Sunday did the squire ride to church with his wife in his beautiful carriage, drawn by a fine pair of horses, where he took his comfortable nap, and MArs. Titus listened atten- tively to the lecture of the minister, the substance. of which 13  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7121-00000146"/> 290     "TIrE' FORGIVING KICSS;" was, '"Believe in Jesus, and you are saved." But one Sun- day the minister changed his theme, and took as his text, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house," etc., etc. Every eye in the church was directed to the squire, and he was thus prevented from having his usual nap, and compelled to listen to an able lecture on the last, but not the least, of the matchless ten commandments. It was an eloquent sermon, for it touched the stony heart of Squire Titus. The minister, noticing the great satisfaction that his sermon gave to his flock, announced that he would deliver, at the evening service, a sermon on "Forgiveness," and he requested every membei, health permitting, to be present. Squire 'ritus could not well stay away from church. When the minister announced that he would deliver a sermon on "Forgiveness," he attended, and heard a scathing rebuke of the man who would not forgive. The sermons were the  town-talk, and all agreed that they were levelled at Squire Titus. 3Bu how comes it that the minister could speak out so boldly? ' Had lie received a call from another congrega- tion? While this interesting question agitated the com- munity, Squire Titus was greatly out of humor, and was undecided whether he should remain on a good footing with the minister of his church, who had dared to preach sermons which so much concerned his shortcomings. While thus occupied, the cry of the parrot, "Susan, come home ; mother wants you," disturbed him, and in an angry moment he took hold of the bird and wrung its neck. The utnlappy wife, seeing the act of cruelty, uttered a cry of pain, and sank fainting to the floor. "I wish you were dead, like this gay bird; for it is through your advice that I sent Susan to the city, to complete there her education!" exclaimed the husband ; and he con- tinued "But there is no reason why I should wish her dead; she meant well by it. It is I who am to blame; I I.   OR, OUR DESTIN.        291 am selfish, very selfish. I am a sinner, I am a deep sin- ner. Let me at least do the best I can for the companion of my youth, who so bravely bore with all my u"neasonable- ness ;" and with these words, Caleb R. Titus betook himself slowly to apply restoratives to his truly wretched wife. Gradually she recovered consciousness, but her look was vacant. She was a speechless maniac! one of those who mechanically walk, sit, eat, drink, sleep, and dress; who pass their lives as silent as the grave., The sight was a sad one. It even affected Caleb Rusha Titus. In vain did he try to recall hi* wife to her former self; she gazed at him as if to say, '"What more do you want of me? Am I not a wreck?" That look mortified that self-willed man, and he acknowledged to himself that half of his princely fortune would he give if his wife could again be right in her mind, and converse as she once did. He tried his best, but Mrs. Titus sat quietly in the corner of the room, trembling with fear that her husband would wring her neck, as he had done her pet polly's. During the day, Squire Titus forgot his troubles, and stilled the voice of his guilty conscience by working hard on his extensive farm ; but at night, the large, empty house, with his smitten wife, was very dreary. None came to see him; none felt friendship for him; though a squire, he was nevertheless unloved, 'and by mlany even de- spised. For hours would he sit and think of the past--and that past was not adorned with noble deeds; if anything, it was wrapped in deeds of cruelty and baseness. To get rid of his oppressing thoughts, he would read every line of the Altfiroolilan Joarnal, new and old copies. One evening, while reading one of the old copies, he started as he read: D-" )ez.-Wehlen.  On the 25th inst., after a short but painful illness, in the forty-eighth year of her age, Bridget T. Wehlen.  The funeral will take place on Sunday, the 28tih  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7121-00000147"/> 292     "THE FORGIVING AKISS;" from her late residence, on Rox Street. Friends are invited without further notice."' "Yes, that must be she!" exclaimed Squire Tittus; and he continued: "Well, I would not have attended her funeral, as only friends are invited. God knows I was not one of her 1 friends, or I would not have driven her, with her baby, eight days after her childbed, from ny premises. But she was to blame; she had no business to seduce my only brother, and make of him a drunkard.'    ' "You made of him a drunkard!" exclaimed Mrs. Titus, in a shrill voice. Squire Titus started at that voice as if a corpse had risen from the grave, and uttered a reproach. "Be it so; but do you know, dear, that Bridget Wehlen  is dead?  The wife made no reply, but looked at her husband with  the same heart-rending, vacant gaze, while a strange smile played round her compressed lips. All of a sudden, the watch-dog barked loudly. A solitary  horseman swiftly rode into the yard, knocked at the window, and in a clear voice said: "Squire Titus, your daughter and grandchildren are starv- ing in the city, and they have been put out on the street by their landlord." At these words, Mrs. Titus rushed from the room, and ex- claimed: "Sir, where is my dalughter?" The horseman, without an answer, took hold of the lady, lifted her into the saddle with one hand, while with the other he took the reins, sharply spurred, and the spirited animal rode headlong away. Squire Titus stood as if riveted to the ground. All this passed within the twinkling of an eye. Recoveringhis aston- ishiment, he hastened to the stable, mounted his flcctest horse,  ,'       , .    OR, OUR DESTINY.        293 and followed the daring rider, who galloped at a fearful speed toward the city. "I swear by my sacred rights that that man shall not carry off my wife as long as there is life in this horse." He urged his horse on with determined energy, and the noble animal gal- loped at its highest speed, and at every stride drew nearer to the chase, who turned and exclaimed: "That's right, Squire Titus, follow! I guarantee it shall be your last ride." "He is armed, and I am not. Perhaps it is a ruse to en- tice me from my home, and his confederates may even now be ransacking my house," reasoned Caleb Rusha Titus ; and he quickly turned toward home, riding even more speedily than before. On reaching his house, lie found everything in order, and at once set to work to see whether his strong-box was not molested, and he breathed more freely, opened it and felt delighted that its brimful contents were not dis- turbed. HeI said: "Shall I now go and awake the neigh- bors, and tell theim what has happened, and ask them to assist me to find the miscreant? I think I had better not; for before I explain how it happened, and they get ready tp start, that man will be miles away; besides, that would give my neighbors a good chance to chuckle over my new mis- fortune. Somehow or other, they rejoice to see me in trouble; perhaps it is because I rejoice when they are in trouble. The world is like a mirror: if we show the mirror a pleasant face, it reflects a Dleasant face; and if we show the mirror a sour, disagreeable face, it reflects back a sour, disagreeable face. The face which I have shown to the world has been a selfish and an unfeeling one, and it pays me back in my own coin. I will therefore not call on my neighbors, and to-morrow will go to the city, take some of my prize hogs with me, and show them to the merchants on exchange. In the meantime let me examine the papers; '  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7121-00000148"/> 294     "THE F ORG IVING KISS; " and Squire Titus counted his gold, silver, and bank-bills. He examined notes receivable to the amount of sixty thousand dollars, saying, ", Not one of these notes will 1 renew to my - neighbors, because they enjoyed the sermon of the minister at my expense. No! not-one of them will I renew. They must pay up, or I will foreclose the mortgages; they shall now find out of what material Caleb-Rusha Titus is made." He continued: "' Now let me look over Uncle Sam's bonds ; they are the nicest property of all-no tax: that  alone endears them to my heart ;" and he repeated, "No tax on them," counting 200 one thousand 5-20 bonds. He then coimmenced to look over numerous titles of various pieces of property, counting uip the marketable value of each, and he soliloquized : "Strange! those farms which I so much coveted have advanced the least; in fact, if I figure the taxes and assessments on them they will barely bring cost, while those pieces in the city have gone up) miraculously. When I made the division of fither's estate, which gave Octavius the poorest piece of land-to which he justly objected-I little thought that-they would in the course of time become a hundred times more valuable than the farm which I took as my share. Fortunately, one of the most valuable pieces can yet be easily construed to belong to me; I had it so recorded, and stole the original coly of the division. 13tt there will be no trouble about it; Octa- vms is no doubt dead, his wife is dead, and their only child no doubt dead too." He paused ; his face grew pale, and he exclaimed, "Is it possible for Otto Wehlen, in whose name I found that piece of property to be recorded, to be the son of Octavius Titus? Yet it must be the son, for her death notice reads Bridget T. Wehlen. The T. stands for Titus. She assumed her maiden name, and her son now bears the name of Wehlen. If he claims the property by the right of purchase, he will have hard work   OR, OUR DESTINY.        295 to make the title good. If he claims it as an heir, he will find it difficult to prove the legitimacy of his birth. I will prove him a bastard, as the minister who married his parents is dead, and the only witness present is either dead or in parts unknown. Even if present at the trial, my money shall purchase her silence. The son of Bridget Wehlen shall not remain in possession of that valuable tract of land. No! not as long as I have a dollar left in this safe to fight the claimant." -He now opened his stock-book and carefully counted up his horses, cows, oxen, bulls, and hogs. "Fowls are not worth counting, but hogs are.," At the word hogs, his eyes bright- ened. "It is a profitable breed." While he knew exactly how many hogs he had, he could not, to save his life, say how many grandchildren he had, so completely was his mind absorbed with matter which extinguished in him the spirit -of human kindness. Closing the safe, he returned to his bed-chamber. As he passed through the sitting-room he observed the empty bird- cage, and it seemed-to him as if he heard the parrot call out, "Susan, come home; mother wants you." "' I am glad that bird does not annoy me any more, and still I must acknowl- edge that I would prefer it if the parrot were yet alive in the cage; the flapping of his wings and the unwelcome cry would be acceptable, as it would break the deathke still- ress which prevails in my house. How dreary it is to be alone!"At every step he paused to listen whether there were any robber about. He reached his sleeping apartment and retired, but for a long time kept awake, listening whether men were not breaking into the premises, to rob him of his wealth. To have wealth is pleasant, if honorably obtained and beneficially used; but to have wealth as Caleb Rusha Titus obtained it, and employed it, is a curse.  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7121-00000149"/> 296      "THEI FORGIVING KISS;"              '  i CHAPTER    XII.

I dislike to put a family out on the street; it is unpleasant, very unpleasant," remarked Mr. Charles Hunting; and turning to his clerk, "You are sure that the reason he does not pay his rent is because he is a drunk- ard?" "I aim quite sure; I saw him very drunk on several oc-   OR, OUR DESTINY.        297 casions, and the premises have the appearance of a drunk- ard's home. Though the weather is bitterly cold, there is no fire in the grate, and the stove in the kitchen looks cool and rusty; the wife and clildren have a haggard, beggarly look; it is a family deeply to be pitied," answered the clerk. "I am sorry for his wife and children, but it is my duty to turn them out on the street;- it may awake the husband to his senses, and cause him to turn over a new leaf. To leave them in my house is to approve of his conduct. No man has a right to be a drunkard. He is no longer fit to be a husband and a-father. He should be treated like an idiot; and placed in an asylum, where he is out of harm's way. Thus society will be saved from his demoralizing presence." "You are right, my son," observed Mr. Edward Hunting. ' An habitual drunkard ought to be placed out of harm's way, and you will do well to allude to it in your lecture, which I believe you are to deliver this evening." "Yes, father, this evening will decide whether I shall for the first and last time address an assembly; for if I fail, I will never again venture to appear before the public as a speaker." "To be an orator, three qualities are requisite: first, the mind must be stored with knowledge; second, the pronunci- ation must be distinct i and third, courage: for without cour- age nothing great can be accomplished. And I am happy to say that you possess all the requisite qualities. Let the multitude of turned-up faces not dismay you; but if any- thing, inspire you to play your part manfully." The son kissed his father, and said, "' My noble father, how shall I ever repay the kindness which you have so boun- tifully extended to me when I. was wayward and on the brink of becoming a reproach to you and my relatives."

Con- tinue in the path of honorable usefulness, and exert your- self to acquire knowledge, and, use that knowledge for the benefit of your fellow-men, and you will amply repay me for all the cares, anxieties, and tears you have caused me," an- swered the father with outstretched arms. The son rushed to his father's arms, and laid his head on his breast, and wept. "My poor son, I comprehend your grief and your holy tears; do not suppress them; weep, and unbosom yourself to me; you have my deepest sympathy." The noble parent could say no more, for his feelings overpowered him and he silently wept. "Father, I am very unhappy; you have seen her riding at the side of Count Carl Von Mardeck, and you know how much Mrs. La Monte thinks of titles: no doubt she has prevailed on Rosalind to marry that Count, and Hand- TI-" "Weep my son, but remember faint heart never won fair lady. Rosalind is a prize, a great prize, worthy of every exertion to win her heart and hand. I think that Rosalind is too sensible to be dazzled by a title, and I think her too honorable to trifle with your feelings. I firmly believe that she will redeem her promise, provided you remain in the path of virtue and fixed occupation. Have courage, my son, and remember wihat I said only a few moments ago, that nothing great can be accolmplished without courage. To win a good wife requires courage, first to conquer ourselves, second to conquer success, and make ourselves in every respect worthy of a true woman's love. Have courage to do your duty, and have patience to bide your time." "I will," answered the son, much comforted by the sym- pathy and words of his kind father. The same evening, hundreds of ladies and gentlemlen,   OR, OUR DESTINY.        299 elegantly attired, assembled at the Hall of the Young Men's Christian Association, all looking joyous, and aDpearing like one happy family gathered together for the ipurpose of enjoying a rare mental feast. All were on the qiu Zive. Before the platform was a large table, around which sat numerous young and elderly men, whose dress and looks ap- peared very careless; there was nothing brilliant about them but their eyes, which shone like stars; they were busy shar- pening their pencils and getting otherwise ready to take notes of the evening's proceedings, for they were reporters of various papers, one of which- the next morning contained the following notice: 'A GALA SCENE AT THE HALL OF THE YOUNG MEN'S CIIRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. "Last night the hall of the Young Men's Christian Asso- ciation presented a very animated scene. Hundreds of ladies and gentlemen in full evening dress assembled to listen to a lecture by Mr. Charles Hunting. "Mr. Otto Wehlen, the president of the association, intro- duced the lecturer, stating that he felt very happy that 50 large an audience honored the lecturer with their presence. This assured him of the deepl interest that a large part of the best portion of the community take in the welfare of the Young Men's Christian Association; and this is as it should be, for if Christians really wish to convert the whole world to their religious belief, they must be a noble example in their mode of life, in their thoughts and acts and deeds of true nobility. Men, like children, are taught and deDly im- pressed through example. Let us set before the world the example of a beautiful life union, and of often assemlbling together to reason and to strengthen us in our onward march toward perfection." The remarks were well received. Mr. Charles Hunting  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7121-00000151"/> 300     "TIt  FORIGZIVNG KISS; " commenced his lecture by saying that his audience had no doubt heard of the congregation who were somewhat divided in their choice of the minister they intended to call. They finally agreed that whichever of the candidates delivered the best lecture on the text that each should find on the pulpit, -of which they had not been previously informed, should be- come the minister of their congregation. The first candidate for the honor, on reaching the pulpit, found on a slip of paper, "The Laws of God," and he at once delivered an able sermon on the ten commandments. The second candidate found on a slip of paper "Charity," and he ably enlarged on the sublimity of charity: "Not only are those who receive benefited by it, but also those who give. It is a double blessing, for it finds grace before God and man."  The third candidate, on reaching the pulpit, found a slip of paper which was blank on both sides; he therefore took as his text, "Of nothing, God made the world," and his being the best sermon of all, he was unanimously called as the minister of that congregation. "I find myself in the samle dilemma. The commnittee have not selected the text on which I am to lecture. I will there- fore choose as imy subject, 'Our Destiny,' What is man's destiny? It cannot be merely to be born to eat, drink, sleep, and suffer pain from the time that we commlence teething, until we lose our teeth, then to die, and again dissolve into mere dust. This cannot be the end of man's existence; there must be a grander purpose for our birth, a nobler reward for our earthly sufferings than death. What is the purpose of our birth? Wlhat reward can we expect for our innumerable sufferings? Man has evidently been created to replenish the earth, to subdue it, and have dominion over all that exists upon the earth; to live happily here, and prepare for an everlasting life in the heavenly regions. "To subdue the earth, and have dominion over all that ex-   OR, oUR DESTIVNY.       30 ists thereon! What a great object, what a great trust to be the Lord of the earth and all that which exists upon it! To do that properly, does it not require intelligence of the highest order? And to acquire this intelligence, we must have peace within us, peace around us. It is therefore our first duty to subdue ourselves, and become master over all those passions which,. if not restrained, make of man a brute, unfit to govern himself, much less to subdue the' earth and govern all that exists upon it." The lecturer then dwelt with fervent eloquence upon the duty of every young man not to be indolent; to avoid the fatal mistake of not learning a profession, and mastering it; and always to remember that on the top is the most room ; to be careful of all expenditures, for extravagance leads to dishonesty, and dishonesty sooner or later to the prison, a dishonored or a p)auper's grave; to be prudent, for pru- dence is the ground-work on which success is built, and to avoid the grave mistake of getting rich in haste, for every- day observation teaches that nearly all those who were ill haste to become rich ended their old days in the poor-house, or died insolvent, leaving to their unfortunate families, as an inheritance, extravagant habits and constant hopes of great expectations, never to be realized. "Tty retain independence is to be master in your profes- sion ; avoid leaving others do the work which you ought to do yourself, and above all avoid living above your means. Be up in time, and do whatever you have to (1o with might and main, and after you have acquired all these habits, then get mlarried to the choice of your heart; have a home of your own in which to rear men and women, who shall make of earth a paradise; who shall governlwith divine-like love, with impartial justice between man and man; who shall be worthy to represent God on earth, and whose souls shall re- turn to the 'Great Spirit,' enlarged by the ennobling inllu-  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7121-00000152"/> 302   "TIE FORGIVING KISS;" 302 ence which they wielded while dwelling among men, making of them seraphs, and entitling them to the reward of living near the Great Spirit, where there is no mystery, where all is clear, and where is the fount of everlasting happiness. This is no doubt ' Our Destiny.'" The lecture was attentively listened to, and although the audience was not dismissed with a benediction, they never- theless felt blessed. Thousands of readers read the report of Mr. Charles Hunting's lecture. Some rejoiced at being able to find flaws in it, which could be easily criticised, and perhaps ridiculed, while others thought it a pretty good lecture firom a young merchant, containing grains of good sense; others again, who have hard work to make both ends meet on account of not having learned or mastered a profession, or who had been careless in their expenditures, or found themselves hopelessly insolvent, wished they had read such a lecture be- fore, and lived up to it; and many a parent, who likes to see his children grow up honorable and useful, brought that lec- ture to their particular notice, and commented favorably on it. Even those who continually speculate on the future state of man thought there was something in the idea that the soul shall expand and go back to the Great Spirit enlarged through its noble achievernents: "to be a small soul is to b1e contemptible." But on none had the report of the lecture such a delightful effect as upon Miss Rosalind La Monte; she felt happy beyond description-her Charles, her dear, dear Charles, was now indeed reformed: a changed man, worthy of her admiration, worthy her undying love. A shade passed over her beautiful face as she exclaimed, "But does he still love me? does he still think me worthy to be his wife?" "iWhose wife?" interrupted Mrs. La Monte, on entering   OR, OUR DESTINY.        3031 the room. "Yes, :I see you have been reading the report of the lecture of Charles Hunting. He is coninig out after all, but he is nevertheless only a shop-keeper. I feel sure that Count Carl Von Mardeck could have delivered a better lec- ture. I have learned that he is going to resign his commis- sion in the Prussian Navy, and come back to the United States with a view of settling in our country," said Mrs. La Monte, keenly observing what effect her words had on her daughter. Viola now entered the room dressed in a riding-habit, whip in hand, saying, "Rosalind, why are you not yet dressed for our morning ride, S. S. S.? Please go; I am waiting, S. S. S., and the horses are panting, S. S. S." "I wish you would not close every sentence with S. S. S.," said Mrs. La Monte, reproachfully. R osalind made a sign to her mother not to find fault with Viola. But it was too late; those few words irritated Viola; she rushed from the room down to the yard where the horses were in readiness, mounted her horse, and galloped off like a Hungarian hussar, who bears dispatches or rides to see his sweetheart on the sly. She urged on her horse to its greatest speed ; she turned firom the road, and in a break- neck manner jumped over ledges and fences. The people were amazed at the daring rider. On she rode, and urged on the animal to still more difficult exploits, jumping higher hedges and fences. The horse, like its rider, became mad, and in its frenzy flew with lightning speed to the right and to the left. The young lady sat as if riveted to the saddle, with that strange smile playing around her lips which chills the blood of those who see and comprehend its singular- ity. While thus riti*g in her perilous condition, she passed Peacock View Cottage. 'The hostler of the house, whlo was airing his master's saddle-horse, noticed the lady as she dashed by him, and exclaimed, "Whly, that is Mrs. Otto  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7121-00000153"/> 304     " 7IE FORGIVING KISS ;  Wehlen!

A moment be- fore he reached the shy animal, it threw its rider to the ground; the hostler dismounted, tied his horse to the fence, and quickly hastened to the aid of the unfortunate lady, who lay senseless on the grass. "Oh, Patrick O'Brien, if ye had now some brandy, would it not be nice!" exclaimed the symplathizing hostler. "But let me go and bring some water in my liat from the nearest brook." But he had no need for water ; Viola recovered consciousness, and opened her eyes as one who awakens from a long sleep, and some oppressive dream. "Mrs. Wehlen, are you hurt?" asked the hostler in a sympathizing tone. "You know me! I am not hurt, I only received a strange shock." "I am glad you did not get hurt, and Mr. Wehlen will feel very happy to learn of your m'iraculous escape." "You know Mr. Wehlen?" interruDtcd the lady. "I know him well. I have been his hostler fQr years, and I venerate him as I venerate the Archbishop." "And do you know where he now resides." "Of course I do; he resides on Rox Street. 'Rox Street is fashionable now." "bFashionable, or not fashionable, take me to miy husband," exclaimed Mrs. ,Wehlen who from the shock had suddenly recovered her snsenss untimplaired. Glad to serve you," was lthe prompt reply. "' I see someI one is bringing your runaway horse. I will tame him im- mediately, for since- stopped dritinng I have the power to tame, a horse by kindness in a few moments; there is noth. ing like being kind to man and beast."   OR, OUR DESTINY.        305 Mrs. Wehlen soon mounted her horse, patted his arched neck, and a happy smile illuminated her beautiful features as she rode toward Rox Street to meet her husband, whom she doubted not would receive her with open arms. Patrick O'Brien felt very proud and happy at having had an opportunity of repaying to some extent Mr. Otto. Weh- len's kindness, by being of service to his wife. i ,   &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7121-00000154"/> 306     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" CHAPTER XIII.

JULIUS SOLOMON, on reaching Halifax, found that Mrs. Ida Lothimore had left for Bos- ton. He hastened back to Massachusetts, and was too late: the lady had taken the train for New York. Reaching New York, he learned that the lady went to, Hartford to consult that eminent physician, Nathanhauser, about her failing health. Thither he went, and found her in good spirits. She heard with great surprise that the son of Mrs. Wehlen had married one of the daughters of Mr. and Mrs. John James La Monte, and with their consent, and felt extremely sorry that Mrs. Wehlen died so suddenly. "Very sudden vas her death: she intended to inform her son of some family secret or history before she died, but all she could say was, 'Mrs. Ida Lothimore,' pointing to her wedding ring. From this the son concluded that you could perhaps give him some information in regard to his father, whom he never saw, and did not know whether he was alive or dead," said Mr. Solomon earnestly. Mrs. Ida Lothimore listened attentively, and remarked: "Whatever I know about this case, I can only divulge to Mr. Wehlen alone. The medical aid which I am receiv- ing of this truly able doctor is rapidly restoring my health, and I will soon be able to resume my journey, and will on   OR, OUR DESTINY.        307 my way home stop at your city and see Mr. Wehlen. In the meantime, I would suggest to you to keep in the com- pany of his Royal Highness King Octavius the First, who is at present at the Astor House. The king, like most kings, is somewhat free in his mode of living, and it would be desirable if you could induce him to accompany you to your city. He has relatives living there, with whom, how- ever, he is not on friendly terms, and does not care to visit; but being of an easy disposition, he could be induced to visit his birthplace. I will give you a letter of introduc- tion;" and with these words Mrs. Ida Lothimore hastily penned a few lines, and gave them to Mr. Solomon, saying, "Please keep me advised whether you have been pleasantly received by his Majesty, and whether he has consented to visit his native place. By that time I may be ready to ac- comlpany you." Mr. Solomon thanked the lady for her great kindness, and promised to write daily, informing her of his reception, and the interview which might be granted to him by the ruler of the turbulent islanders. The next day, Mr. Julius Solomon, on presenting his let- ter of introduction to King Octavins, wan vary cordially received, the king addressing him : "You, sir, are no stran- ger to me. I have seen some of your works of art which I greatly admired. A great artist has a natural Datent of nobility, and is therefore an equal of a king who possesses the great art of ruling well. I am on a tour from the island which I have the honor to govern, and while thus far away from home would be pleased to have your company, for I judge that a great artist possesses also the art of passing the time in elegant leisure, sipping of all the pleasures that pre- sent themselves in a metropolis like this, with an elegance worthy of his art." "Your Royal Highness-"  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7121-00000155"/> 308     "TI 7E FORGIVING KCISS;  "Please call me. simply Octavius. I only allow ladies to address me thus, for I know it pleases some of them so well to have the honor of addressing a king, that I would not deprive theml of the pleasure ; but by a man of your repute, 1 prefer to be addressed as Octavius." "I sincerely thank you for your urbanity, and will feel happy indeed to add as nmuh as is within my ability to your pleasure, while you remain in our hospitable Republic." "' I will avail myself of your offer to add to my pleasures, and request you to occupy a suite of rooms next to mine in this hospitable house." The king gave a peculiar whistle, and forthwith three of his attendants appeared. They were islanders, in their native costume. He directed them to be henceforth at the service of Artist Solomon, whoml he delighted to honor. The guard bowed becflore their new master, who looked amazed, and thought of the Arabian Nights. He was mak- ing some remarks, when his new friend gave a sign of si- lence, waved his hand, and said  "Your attendants will conduct you to your apartments. You can call on me unannounced.' Artist Solomon found himself in a suite of elegant rooms, to which he had his baggage transported, and for several weeks he was the constant companlion of King Octavius the First. They passed the time in elegant leisure, and sipped of all the pleasures that a great metropolis presents, eslpc,- ially to those who have unlimited means at their command, as King Octavius seemed to have, and which indeed he 'spent with a lavish hand. The time passed swiftly. Artist Solomon corresponded not only with his friend, Otto Wehlen, but also with Mrs. Ida Lothimore, who in every letter praised the medical treatment which she received from the great doctor. At last her welcome epistle came announcing her full restoration to health, and readiness to continue her !1   OR, OUR DESTINY.        309 journey; and inviting him to accompany her, and, if possi- ble, to induce King Octavius to go with them. Gently did Artist Solomon break the news to his royal friend that he must depart for home, and eloquently did he invite him to accompany him and see his studio, in which he had several pictures completed, but one picture in par- ticular would he be pleased to show him, as he considered it his masterpiece, called the lBattle of Gravelotte. "Well, the weather is delightful, and to please you I will make a short visit to your home, although it was not my intention to visit the interior of this great country: and let us commence our journey to-morrow." Artist Solomon immediately telegraphed to Mrs. Ida Lothimore and to M-n Otto Wehlen that at last he would start on his journey homeward, and bring not only Mrs. Ida Lothimore with him, but also King Octavius. To which Mrs. Ida Lothimore replied that she would be in New York the next morning, and expected to meet them at the depot of the New York Central: while Mr. Otto Wch- len telegraphed that he had engaged a suite of rooms at the New Hotel, which was ready for occupation, for Mrs. Ida Lothimore and King Octavius. "Distinguished Arrival" was the heading of one of the notices in .the morning papers, which read thul: "Mrs. Ida Lothimore, the heroine through whose presence of mind and courage the steamcr ' The Conqueror of the 1Wavs ' was saved, and King Octavius the First, are at the New Hotel. They are the guests of Mr. Julius Solomon, the well-known artist. /Mr. Edward Hunting, the President of the Mechanics' Fund Aid Association, of which Mrs. Ida Lothimore is the founder, has called a special meeting of the boaid. to take into consideration a proposal to give the lady a lpublic welcome lhoome froin her foreign travels, which  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7121-00000156"/> 310     ' "THE FORGIVING KISS;" proposal we hope the board will unanimously adopt. ' Honor to those to whom honor is due.'" None read that paragraph with greater attention than Mrs. John James Ia Monte. She felt delighted that there was a king in town ; that part of the article referring to Mrs. Ida Lothimore, through whose energy a steamer at sea,  with its precious freight and treasure, was saved, and who , had endowed an institute which caused sunshine in many a home, did not interest her. She only wished that his Royal Highness King Octavius the First would give a public re- ception, which she would surely attend. But King Octav- ius was otherwise occupied than with holding a levee. He looked about the city with astonishment and said : "I left this city full of frame buildings, and on my return I find it full of brick and marble mansions; property which was not worth paying the tax on, is valued at fabulous prices." He gazed with amazement at a certain piece, and soliloquized : "Yes,  this is the piece. I recognize it by its Roman nose; it is mine by right. It is now worth a million of dollars ; but what is a million dollars now to me? Still it is worth owning; I  will go to the Court-house and see in whose name it is re- corded." Reaching the Court-house, he requested the recording clerk to show him the records of a certain piece of real estate, describing its location. "Oh, yes, I know the piece which you mean. The title ! to that piece is not quite clear; there have been already half a dozen lawyers looking at it, and taking notes. It will give rise to a big law-suit. The property is now worth over a million dollars." King Octavius made no reply, and carefully read'the title, and thought: Even in this he tried to cheat me. IBut what do I see? The present owner is Otto Wehlen. Was not Bridget's name Wehlen? Let me go and see the   OR, OUR DEST7INY        3 1 marriage certificate records." With difficulty could he re- member in what year he was married ; but with the assist- ance of one of the clerks, a copy of his marriage certificate was soon before him.  "Yes, Bridget Wehlen was her maiden name; Mrs. Ida Lothilore was the witness-here is her signature. Is it possible that Mr. Wehlen, whom I have visited at his residence on Rox Street, to see the great painting of the Battle of Gravelotte, and with whom I passed such a charming evening, should be my own son? Let me hasten to the bank of which he is the cashier. Let me learn from his own lips whether he knows his father. Let him describe to me his mother; what happiness will be mine if he should prove to be my son." On reaching the bank he asked Peter, the bank porter, whether he could see the cashier, Mr. Otto Wehlen, privately. Peter gazed at him inquiringly, and asked, "Whom shall I announce?" "Announce King Octavius," was the reply. Peter stepped quickly into the private office of the cash- ier, and in great excitement exclaimed, "Otto! Otto! King Octavius wishes to see you privately. And whom do you supplose this King Octavius looks like? The very fel- low who twenty-five years ago rode by my house on bare horseback, and wanted to give me your valuable hill for a saddle, an old hat, and a chew of tobacco. May I be flogged if he is not the same man. He may be a king now, but he looked like a beggar then." ' "Peter, you must be, mistaken." "I am not. I recognize him by his heavy jaw bones and compressed lips." "Do not say anything, but show him in." * There is now actually living in Paris, a Frenchman who at one time was king under circumst ances somewhat similar to those described in the text.  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7121-00000157"/> 312     ( TZHE FORGIVING KICSS;"      The cashier greeted the visitor with his usual politeness, and was at his service. "Can you sell me a sight draft on London for two  hundred thousand pounds sterling?" asked the visitor in a business tone.  "Yes, I can, for a certified check," was the prompt re- sponse.  "I cannot give you a certified check, but will deliver you  the gold, on receipt of a certified draft from your London  banker for the same amount, less exchange."  "Our bank does not sell certified checks. If its own  draft is not considered sufficient, the transaction cannot be ; entered into. You can, however, telegraph to the house of  Rothschilds, or Baring Brothers, of London, to ask whether they will honor our draft for two hundred thousand pounds  sterling. Their answer will be an additional guarantee of the value of a draft of this bank." "A chip of the old block," thought King Octavius, highly  delighted with Mr. Otto Wehlen's promplt and calm reply, [ and he said "I will let you know, either to-day or to-  morrow, whether to draw that draft on London. By the bye,  I am told that you are the owner of that romantic piece of property opposite the Grand Park entrance. Would you sell it, and at what price?"  "I am the owner of the ground you refer to, but would not sell it now, as the title is not sufficiently clear in every particular. However, I have engaged able' attorneys to take the proper legal steps to obtain a good title."  "Do you know the former owner?"  "He is called Caleb Rusha Titus, and has the reputation of being a very hard-hearted, greedy, and vindictive man. "o my knowledge I have never seen him, and regret the necessity of coming into contact with him." "I tell you again, you dare not go into that room now; :,.   OR, OUR DESTINY.        313 the cashier is engaged," exclaimed Peter, in such a loud tone that Mr. Wehlen heard it. He opened the door to see who it was. Recognizing Mrs. Susan Fraaz'r, with one child in her arms and the other holding to the folds of its mother's dress, he beckoned them to come, in, and asked her, "What can I do for you?" "You are very kind, sir. You have so often by your lib- erality saved me and my children from great distress. To- day I am on the verge of despair; the landlord has sent the constable to put us out on the street. 1 begged the consta- ble to grant me time until noon; he complied with my re- quest, on condition of my giving my consent to his taking off the locks from all the doors, in order to have access to all the rooms'at his pleasure." The poor woman could not proceed; tears of woe overpowered her, and she wept. "Be seated, madam," said Mr. Otto Wehlen, offering the poor woman a cliair. "Be seated," repeated he, while tears gathered in his eyes. "Thank you, sir;" and she continued "The constable took off the locks, and will be back by noon, and if I have not the money to pay the rent -and the costs of the suit by that time, my little furniture will be put out on the street, and I will be without a home. I have not a friend on earth but you, to whom I could appeal for help with the slightest hope of being assisted. I have no claim on your friendship, except the claim of common humanity. For the sake of my starving children, I beg of you to loan me iifty dollars. I know it is a very large amount to loan to a poor stranger like me ; but that is the amount I must have to pay the landlord. I promise you, the first money which I can ever spare from my scanty earnings shall be paid to you." "Madam, are you a widow?" "No, sir; my husband is still living, but I do not "  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7121-00000158"/> 314     "THE FORGIVING KISS;"  know in which of the city's institutions he is to-day," answered the poor wife mournfully. "In what capacity does he serve the city?" "In whatever capacity the police-court judge directs. The facts are, my husband drinks; I married against the will of'my parents, who have disowned me. I have struggled hard to rescue my husband from the baneful habit, I have toiled day and night to make a living for my family, but,  alas! the pay for my work is so very, very small. Still I ; hope, if I get over the present difficulty, I could muster courage and struggle on until my children are grown up, and help to earn something. It would break my heart if I were  put out of the house." "And have you no relatives who would intercede with  your parents to forgive you your disobedience?" asked King Octavius, feelingly.  "My father never forgives either an imaginary or a real i wrong which he thinks he has suffered. I feel quite sure  that he would not admit me into his affections. Besides j; that, none would dare to speak to him of me ; it arouses his i wrath to hear my name mentioned, and he looks upon every  one as an enemy who speaks to him of his daughter Susan. I wrote to the minister of his church to ask him to preach a  sermon on ' Forgiveness.' Perhaps it would soften the heart of my father; but the minister wrote to me that a day after he preached that sermon my poor mother became demnented. This information made me more wretched than ever. Being  disheartened and broken down, nothing sustains me but hope, and the affection for my children, and my desire to  bring them up well. I am encouraged to ask of you, as a stranger, assistance." "Who is your father? I will write to him," asked Mr.  Otto Wehlen.  "My father's name is Caleb Rusha Titus."   OR, OUR DESTINY.        315 u Caleb Rusha Titus!" exclaimed Mr. Otto Wehlen and King Octavius, in one voice. "I hope my father has done you no wrong. You seem to be frightened, as the good Mrs. Wehlen was when she heard that I was the daughter of Caleb Rusha Titus. O God! what a misfortune, what a fate, to have a father who is so unpopular!" "I was not aware that my good mother was frightened when she heard the name of your father mentioned&amp; Please tell me when this occurred." "' On the day when you arrived from your wedding tour, I brought a parcel of sewing, and left the baby at Mrs. Xoldrick's. When coming back to get the baby, your mother asked me who my parents were, and when she heard my father's name, she fainted. Perhaps it would have been better if I had not said this; but I am a truthful woman." "Mr. Wehlen, would you have any objection if I were to accompany this lady home, and attend to her wants?" asked King Octavius. "Sir, you are very kind; but she has appealed to me-" "Then let us both share the expense," interrupted King Octavius; and turning to the lady, said: "I am at your ser- vice; the constable shall be paid, but he must replace the locks and apologize for his rudeness. What a barbarous deed! I wonder what he meant to gain by it?" Mrs. Fraazer, apologizing to Mr. Otto Wehlen for having intruded upon his valuable time, accompanied King Octa- vius, who on the way questioned her in regard to the place where she was, born--what sized farm her father had-- whether any of his sisters or brothers were living-to all of which Mrs. Fraazer promptly replied, satisfying King Octa- vius that she was indeed the daughter of Caleb Rusha Titus. On reaching the premises, they found the constable waiting. King Octavius invited him into the rooms, told him the  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7121-00000159"/> 316     "THE FOR GIVING AKISS;"  money for the rent and costs of suit was ready, but he must ' replace the locks, apologize to the lady-for having treated ij her so unkindly, and explain what he meant to gain by tak. ;- ing off the locks of the premises.             i The constable replied that he would replace the locks as 1 soon as the money was paid over to him. He had not     } treated the lady unkindly, therefore had no apology to make. : The removing of the locks secured him the right to enter  the premises at pleasure, and place the furniture and family  on the street. They had no longer a right to the rooms;   ; but if the keys remained in her possession, she could lock up the doors, leave the premises during the day, and at evening return to occupy them; or, as had often happened   i to him, lock up the premises and go visiting for weeks, and-  thus deprive the landlord of his premises; "for the consta-  ble," he said, "has no right to break into the house and   i remove the furniture, and take possession; he must first read the warrant, and after having read the warrant, he has  the right to eject and take possession of the rooms, as long as the rent is not paid. Mrs. Fraazer stands ejected, and  - only through his courtesy she and her household goods are  now on the premises." The explanation being satisfactory, King Octavius paid  the rent, and the constable forthwith replaced the locks and  returned the keys to the lady of the house, and left.    " King Octavius looked about the premises, and was amazed at the extreme poverty displayed. He thought: "All that  could have been taken to the pawnbroker has no doubt found its way there. And this is m y brother's only daughter  and 'his grandchildren! My son, a child of poor Bridget, whom hle so despised and abused-is a cashier of a bark, who can draw on the Rothschilds, or Barings, of London, a sight draft for one million dollars in gold, and the same son of his former servant-girl was the means of saving from starr-   OR, OUR DESTINY.        317 ing the daughter and grandchildren of his mother's former employer, whose opposition to my marriage to her made of me an outcast-a wanderer-until I reached that island where I succeeded in forgetting the past, and became again a man worthy of God's image." "I have nothing to offer you, sir, but my heartfelt thanks for your timely assistance. May God bless you; and may I have the opportunity to repay you!" "I will offer you that opportunity now, and request you to accompany me, with your children, to the house of your parents." "Never, never," interrupted Mrs. Fraazer, "could I con- sent to that; I would imperil my life, and would not like to offer my father the opportunity to become a murderer. I would rather die than place niyself and my father in such a position!" "Then I will endeavor t- bring your mother here, and you must endeavor to become reconciled with your parents. You must do that for the -a ke of your children. I will now go and send soime groceries, some meat, flour, and coal, and here is somehAioney with which to pay for having the coals shoveled into the cellar. You can expect me in a few days with your mother ;" and before Mrs. Fraazer could express her thanks to the noble benefactor he was gone, and shortly after all those delicacies were promptly delivered, for moneylmakes the mare go," but not half so quickly as tradesmen when delivering goods sold for cash at their own prices. The pot, soon boiled, and the hungry children merrily looked up at their, busy mother, who was as quick as a cricket preparing a good meal, for which all had a good alpetite. King Octavius at once bought the swiftest horse money could procure, and a broad saddle. Placing spurs to the  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7121-00000160"/> g31 8     TIfF' FORGIVING KISS;" heels of his boots, he galloped off toward the old homestead. On reaching the village at dusk, he stopped at the tavern, i ordered a good supper for himself and beast, and after  questioning the tavern-keeper about the prosperity of the ' farmers, he learned that the meanness of his brother was so great, that he was despised by all, and the poverty of the county could be directly traced to him. His opposition to all public improvements retarded the prosperity of all, and all who could sell out left the county. His meanness knew  no bounds. The only redeeming quality he had, was that he lived peaceably and paid all his debts with reasonable promptitude. He was a church member, and when the church was short, he would advance the money and help the con- gregation to keep up the organization. "It is a great pity that he is so selfish, for le could do a great deal of good if he  only were so inclined." After having paid for the comforts for himself and horse,  he departed, and soon appeared before the window a scene: which we have described in a preceding chapter. Mrs. Titus held fast to the daring rider, and kept exclaiming, "I ,i will soon see my daughter Susan. Susan, come home;    [ mother wants you. Kind sir, tell me how many children has  she; are they all boys or all girls, or boys and girls? Oh, kind sir, ride faster still, so that I can see them all so much  sooner! Susan, come home ; mother wants you," was the closing exclamation of every sentence. King Octavius, who was used to daring exploits and savage misery, felt, nevertheless, cold perspiration pouring  down on his brow whenever Mrs. Titus exclaimed in a shrill voice, "Susan, come home; mother wants you." At last  they reached the humble home of poor Susan and her haggard little ones. The horse, half dead from his extra- ordinary exertion, felt a relief when its master and his charge i dismounted. It was just before the break of day, and King    OR, OUR DESTINY.        319 Octavius had to knock several times before tlIe weary wife and }mother heard, and asked, "Who is it?"  t It is I."  "Who is I'?" "The man who had the locks put back in their place. Please open the door, and let your mother in." "My good mother i" was the joyful exclamation. The door was soon wide open, and mother and daughter were in each other's arms, kissing, and weeping tears of joy. ' Aml I dreaming, or is it reality?" exclaimed Mrs. Titus in her natural voice. ' "Susan, my child, light the big lamp; my eyes are too dim to see clearly by this taper." "Mother, I am too poor to have such a lamp and other oil; I feel only too glad to have such light as that. Many are the nights that I and my children have passed in utter darkness, nothing but the dim light of the stars and hope in God's grace to cheer us in our deep despair." "Poor, poor, Susan!" exclaimed the unhappy mother, weeping as though her heart would break. "Oh, why did you marry against the will of your parents, and make your- self and us miserable for life?" "Dear mother, do not weep, do not reproach me; forgive me or my heart will break. I can bear all the misery of poverty, but your reproach is too much for me. Forgive me, mother; oh, forgive me! I am very, very unhappy." "I forgive you; come to my heart, and nothing but death shall part us again." Mother and daughter mingled their tears. In the corner of the room sat King Octavius, drying his eyes and saying to himself, "If Caleb could but see this scene, though his heart were marble he would forgive his daughter and again care for her welfare with fatlerly affection." Caleb Rusha Titus, on awakening in the morning, missed his wife, and with difficulty recalled to his memory how she  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7121-00000161"/> 320    "Tc TlE FORGIVING A ISS;  was carried off, how he followed the daring rider, and how , quickly he returned when the thought occurred to him that robbers might rob his premises. How very happy he felt  r on reaching home and finding everything all right; how  i carefully he counted his wealth and found the sum pretty  large, and which he hoped to increase largely by obtaining  full possession of that valuable piece of land opposite the Giand Park entrance. -iYes," he exclaimed, "I will fight that Otto Wehlen's claim to the last. He stands a good  chance of losing not only that piece of property, but all his other property in lawsuits. He will find me a tough cus-  tomer to have anything to do with." He called the maid-servant, and said, "Your mistress went visiting, and will not be back for a few days. You can serve ' my breakfast, and tell the hostler to hitch my bays to my  spring-wagon; I want to take the hog ' Excelsior' to town."  The orders were promptly obeyed, and Squire Titus was  : soon on his way to the city; not so much in search of his wife, as to show his hog to the merchants at the Exchange. On reaching the city, he put up at one of the farmers' taverns, and placing his team and hog in charge of the hostler, he repaired to the chief of police, where he reported that his wife had been carried off by some villain, and that  he felt sure that she had been taken to the city.  "Did she elope, or was she forcibly removed from homne?"  asked the chief. "She was carried off against her will by an enemy." ' Whom do you know in the city that you can suspect?" "Andrew Fraazer is my son-in-law, but I disown him and  his wife."  "Andrew Fraazer is your son-in-law!" exclaimed the chief and several of the policemen. "Yes, my daughter married him against my will, but I will have nothing to do with him."            {   OR, OUR DESTINY.        321 "He is of excellent family; his father was a pious deacon of the church, but some rascally neighbor forced him into a lawsuit, and ever since that the whole family has gone down hill," remarked one of the policemen in a sylmpathetic tone. It cannot be your son-in-law, Andrew Fraazer, for two nights ago he was found dead drunk in the gutter, and the rats had gnawed away both of his big toes and one of his ears before he was picked up. He is now in the hospital; his whole body is swelling, and the malady is baffling the skill of our most eminent physicians; the probabilities are that he will never recover, poor fellow. He once gave great promise of becoming a fine lawyer, and if his family relations could have been pleasanter, he would no doubt have thrown a lustre on the profession. Sir, you have committed a great sin in having witldrawn your parental affection from hilll who became related to you through marriage ; and as you have sowed, so will you reap; your chickens are coming oiume to roost," said the chief of police with severity. "I did not come here to be lectured like a school-boy," exclaimed Squire Tituswith indignation; " what I want of you is to help me find my wife." 4' All we can do is to telegraph to all the police stations, giving a description of your lost wife; and, if found, we will have her escorted home to you; but to set about a regular search the detective force must. be employed, and the de- tectives do not work for nothing."

Yes, ten five-dollar bills will I give," re- peated he, looking in astonishment at the burst of laughter which greeted his supposed great liberality. "What are youlaughing about?" asked he, angrily.

No detective would think of taking a step to find your  wife unless you promise to pay at least five hundred dollars."  "Five hundred dollars-one hundred five-dollar bills!"'  exclaimed Squire Titus, rushing from the office. But he soon 1 returned, and said, "I would not mind making the reward ;i one hundred dollars-twenty five-dollar bills; come, gentle-  mel, be reasonable." The chief looked at Squire Titus with contempt, and said, "You had better look about yourself, and if you fail in your search, then you can make your bargain with some one on the detective force." "Well, I guess I had better look about myself. Gentle- men, please have nothing about this in the papers; I dislike newspaper notoriety," said Squire Titus, earnestly. No doubt you do; it will not be at all pleasant for you I to read that Caleb R. Titus appeared before the chief of  police, begging the assistance of the force to search for his wife, whom some one had carried off. Caleb Rusha Titus is the father-in-law of Andrew Fraazer, who has lately been picked up in the gutter dead drunk, with both his big toes and one of his ears gnawed off by rats. The father-in-law of that young man is very wealthy, a very-grasping and a  very shrewd farmer, but, alas! a very unforgiving and re- vengeful man. He is a Tartar, upon whom the blessed light  of religion has not yet dawned; all is dark and extremely selfish within him. He is a fit subject for the missionaries- ; they need not travel far to find him; he lives in our own county, only a few miles off," said a young man, to which l- Squire Titus listened with his mouth open.        . Recovering his astonishment, he exclaimed, "Who are  %i you, who dare to use such language in my presence?" "I  am reporter of the Metropolitan Journal, and I dare not only to speak it, but to publish it in the paper."    OR, OUR DESTINAY.       323 "What a queer world this is, that a seedy fellow like you should have the impertinence to vilify me. I had better leave, for I feel that my blood is up, and might be tempted to knock your brains out!" and with those words, Squire Titus retreated in bad humor with himself and the queeP world we live in. On reaching the tavern, and beholding his "Excelsior Hog," his eyes shone with happiness, and he said, "If that reporter could see this hog he would have quite a different opinion of me; no such hog was ever raised by any other man in the whole county. I guess it is about time to take him down to the Exchange and exhibit him to the merchants." And Squire Titus proudly drove his team to the Exchange, which he found crowded with merchants who were doing honor to a distinguished guest, King Octavius the First, of the -Cannibal Islands. "Order! order!" was the cry .in all parts of the hall. The King is going to respond to the speech of the President of the Merchants' Exchange." And Squire 'ritus pressed forward to have a good glimpse of the king, and hear his remarks. "I have seen that man before," thought Squire Titus. "Why, he is my brother Octavius! I recognize him by the cut on his forehead which I inflicted with my knife. He a king, and H" He was interrupted, for the king began to speak, and- said: "Mr. President and gentlemen of the Merchants' Ex- change: I most gratefully thank you for the courtesies which you have so kindly tendered to me, and for your approving remarks, which I highly vakie, as they come spontaneously from such an eminent body as yours, which embraces the flower of the mercantile honor and the ability of this great metropolis. I can assure you, gentlemen, that this testimlony of your appreciation of my having planted the tree of an enlightened civilization on the Cannibal Islands, amply re-  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7121-00000163"/> 324     "THE FORGIVING KISS ; '  wards me for the herculean labor aind care it required to accomplish it. I gladly comply with your reqluest to make the ports of the Cannibal Islands free. Every article of commerce shall have fiee entry, except whiskey, brandy, and pork ; these articles are not permitted in my territory, as I consider them detrimental to the morals and health of the people. Every cargo of such merchandise will be con- fiscated, and if the same parties bring another cargo, they will be imprisoned for seven years, at hard labor. "The laws of my dominion are few, but those few laws are rigidly enforced, and, as a consequence, my subjects enjoy peace and happiness; and I feel quite certain that as long as intoxicating drinks and pork can be kept from the island, the tree of an enlightened civilization will grow and shield my people from ill winds that bring pestilence into every  house." After the address, several of the most prominent merchants were presented to the king. They felt happy to make his personal acquaintance; some5 congratulated him upon his firmness in excluding the baneful merchandise fromn his territory, while others passed him with sullenness, just like his brother Caleb, who was now in his glory as he exhibited his hog. The merchants commented favorably on the unclean animal; some admired his snout, others his finely shaped ears, while others contented themselves with the  silky curl of the tail. "The finest hog that ever was seen in the city!" "A grand hog!" exclaimed another. "Let us have a speech on the beauty of this hog," exclaimed the  third. A gentleman was about to make some remarks,  when he was interrupted by a cry of agony from a wonlan, poorly clad, who passed, and for a momen t gazed at the hog and its exhibition, and exclaimed, "My father! I am m1is- erable; Andrew is at the point of death ; you must see  him." "Yes, Caleb, you must come and see him," exclaimed   OR, OUR DESTINY.        325 another woman, who looked like the mother of the miserable woman. Squire Titus looked daggers. Now, when the merchants were eulogizing him for having raised the biggest and fin- est hog in the county, it was a terrible thing for his daughter and wife to come and deprive him of this coveted joy. Was there ever a man more annoyed by a wife and daughter than he? "Caleb, do not tarry: Andrew is at the hospital; he is dying, and you must come. Y.1pn must come immediately, it will not do to lose time. Come, Caleb; come, husband, collie!" ' Please, father, come with us!" implored the daughllter. "Let me drive the team to the tavern first, then I will go with you. Plague it!" With theee words, Squire Titus cracked his whip, the horse started, and the crowd dis- persed-the wife and daughter rapidly following the team, for fear that he might not go with them should they lose sight of him. On- their arrival he turned to his wife and daughter, and said, "This is what I call hunting a man  down. Well, I will go with you. To see Andrew Fraazer dying is worth a walk; but before I go, tell me who was the man that brought you to the city." "It was your brother Octavius; he is now a king, and his son, the son of his wife Bridget, is the cashier of one of the largest banks of this city; married to one of the richest young ladies, loved and respected by all; while you, with all your money, are disliked; and our only ,daughter, her husband, and our grandchildren live like beggars. Think of it, Caleb 1 Otto Wehlen, the son of Bridget, whom you so cruelly treated, saved Susan and her children from starva- tion. What a shame! what a mortification!" Cold perspiration' gathered on the brow of Caleb Rusha Titus. Every word which his wife uttered pierced his heart  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7121-00000164"/> 326     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" and penetrated his soul; and the words, "while you, with - all your money, are disliked," rang in his ears; he felt them , keenly, for he knew it was the truth. He disliked! and his children living like beggars, and his brother and son hon- t ored and living in opulence. He must change his course; he must be more of a man, devote more of his time to men than to hogs. "I fear," he concluded, " that I have been a hog myself." Turning to his wife and daughter, he said kindly, "Yes, I will go with you to see Andrew, and for- give him." They reached the hospital, and were promptly conducted to the dying relative, who was vainly wrestling with death, his whole body being saturated with poisonous whiskey., The bites of the rats set the alcohol on fire, and it consumed  him like a burning flame. "Andrew, our parents are come to see you and pray for  you; do you recognize them?" "They are your parents, but they never were mine; they need not pray for me, but pray for themselves. Let thenm implore God to forgive them their sins.' They ruined my parents, and that led to my own ruin.. Their covetous- ness, their pride, their hard hearts, made me a drunkard; an outcast whom rats have gnawed, while yet alive, and who will die like a pauper and be buried in a pauper's grave. Susan, darling, precious, angel wife, forgive me that I have not proven worthy of your affection; forgive me, I have been weak. I could not withstand the temptations that met me at every corner. I could not bear the trials and galling dis- appointments of life. I needed stimulants to keep me up; but the stimulants pulled me down into the deepest pit of degradation. I see it all now, but it is too late. Kiss our children. Let them learn a good trade, and let theml beware of stimulants and false pride. I)o not kiss me, for I aml im- pure; I am not worthy of your hallowed touch,"    OR, OUR DESTINY.        327 "Andrew, Andrew, with all your faults you are still my beloved husband, the father of my children!

Live, live, for a better day is dawning; our parents will assist us to battle life successfully. Andrew, dear husband, speak!" "Forgive!" was Andrew Fraazer's last word; death ended his agony. "My hard heart, my grasping hand, has made such a sad end of Andrew Fraazer, the hope, the joy of his peaceful parents, the youthful hope and joy of my only daughter," thought Caleb Rusha Titus; and he continued: "That re- porter pictured me correctly: I am a Tartar, on whom the blessed light of religion has not dawned; darkness prevailed within me, and dark were my deeds. To atone for them shall henceforth be my mission." Turning to his wife and daughter, he said, "Do not weep; God has given, God has taken away. His struggles are over; he is gone to a better world. I will arrange for-his burial; he shall rest by the side of his parents, in the simple village grave- -yard." Those affectionate words from the Ihusand and father, so unusual, had a soothing effect upon the weeping wife and mother; and they departed to their humble home, while the father arranged with an undertaker to bring the corpse to the village. His next step was to sell the hog, at any price, and arrange his wagon with seats to take home with him his wife, his daughter, and grandchildren, whom he for th first time saw. Their haggard appearance appealed to his com- passion, and a cold chill passed through his whole body as he observed the bow legs of his only grandson. He compre- hended at a glance that the child's bones were eweak firom want of proper noturishhent fromn his mother, whien she nrieded extra care and affectionate attention.

He had worshipped graven images in the shape of dollars. Anything that would in- crease those images was dear to his heart. In them his affections were concentrated; everything else was unworthy of his attention. God, wife, children,. relatives, humanity, were a secondary consideration ; and as his dollars increased so decreased God, wife, children, relatives, and humanity in his estimation. He was no longer a man in feeling : he resembled the unclean animal, the hog. King Octavius stepped into the room, pleasantly greeting the occupants; but on seeing his brother, he retreated a few steps, exclaiming, "I am amazed to see you here! I thought you were busy exhibiting your hog, and rejoicing in the pride of having raised a hog-and that is all that you did raise. Look at your poor daughter; look at your poor grandchildren they bear the impress of your neglect; they have been irushe. through your selfishness. Caleb Rusha Titus, rise up like a man, and be no longer the creeping reptile whose touch is poisonous, in whose presence every- thing withers. Rise up in the grandeur of noble manhood; be worthy of God's image; be worthy of being a citizen, a husband, a father, a friend of humanity." "Brother Octavius, let the past bury its past. Forgive. Forgive me all the wrongs that I have done you and yours. Henceforth I will be a man worthy of God's grace and the  respect of his fellow-men." "C On those conditions I forgive you, and offer you the hand of a brother; and in a few days I will visit you at the old homestead, and introduce to you my son. In the meantime I bid you a pleasant reunion and a pleasant journey home."  i   OR, OUR DESTIIN.        329 Mr. Qtto Wehlen was busy at the bank when Mrs. Gold- rick hastily entered the office, exclaiming, "Mr. Otto, O dear me! how I ran down town to bring you a letter which I knew would delight you!" and Mrs. Goldrick handed to the young cashier a letter, which he quickly opened, and read  "; MY DEAR HUSBAND: "This morning I took a horseba,;ck ride.

"Yes, sir, I did," was the prompt reply. "Are you the man who gave me that chew of tobacco?" "I am the man; and I was looking for you these twenty years to tell you how sorry I feel that I did not make the bar- gain. Why, sir, that land is now worth a million of dollars." "Is it? And who owns it now?"  "The cashier of this bank, Mr. Otto Wehlen," answered Peter, rubbing his hands and smiling joyfully. "You like the cashier?"                , "No nobler man ever lived. He deserves good luck, and everybody who knows him wishes him prosperity. But:  of late he has had great misfortunes to bear."  "What were they?"

' A few days ago I intended to buy of you a draft on London for two hundred thousand pounds sterling, but [ have since learned such pleasant news that I have been induced to give up my intended trip to the capital of Eng- land, or, I might say, the world, and rather prolong my stay i: this great and beautiful city." *               s 5^   OR, OUR DESTIN.         331 "rhe news must indeed have been very gratifying--" "Gratifying beyond measure," interrupted King Octa- vius. "Imagine a man who has a royal fortune-the income  of a king of a wealthy principality-but who is alone, without relatives, without a wife, without children ; and that man be- coming reconciled to his relatives, and finding that he has a son by a wife who has left him, and that son has grown up a model of noble manhood! Could such a man be other- wise than happy?" "His cup of happiness must be full," answered Otto Wehlen. "So it will be; so it will be, provided you will recognize me as your loving father, for you are my own son, my dear son. Come to my arms!" "M ty father, my father!" exclaimed Otto, and the filial instinct asserted itself, and he rushed into his father's arms. Mrs. Ida Lothimore stepped into the office and ex- claimed, "How happy I am to see father and son in each other's arms!" and turning to the son, she said, "I was a witness of the marriage ceremony, and I am your go(d- mother. How lmuch I regret that your good' mother is not  alive to become reconciled to your father. Peacelte to her ashes and everlasting happiness to her soul!" To which the husband and son said a solemn Amen. "Please, father, tell me how you became estranged from my good mother, and how it was that we never heard from you."

I ill-treated my good wife to such an extent, that a few months after our  marriage she left me; and notwithstanding my efforts to find her, she was lost to me. This maddened me sti more against my brother Caleb, and finding him in the fikld at  work, I accused him of being the cause of my unhappiness. Fromi words we came to blows, and I left him for dead on' the ground. With all possible haste, I reached a seaport, and became a sailor; our ship foundered, and I was picked up by the cannibals. They were about slaughtering me to make of rme a meal, when one of them detected that I was an habitual tobacco-chewer, and such meat not being pleas- ant to their taste, they spared my life, and made of me a  slave. From a hard-laboring slave I became their ruler, civilized them, and turned their islands into the garden- spot of the world. I should perhaps never have returned, were it not for the fortunate circumstance of having rescued Mrs. Ida Lothimore from a watery grave; she recognized me, and informed me that my wife lived, still as my widow, and that she had a son, but could not tell whether that son were alive. I determined to visit the place of my birth. On my arrival, I took steps to ascertain whether my wife was yet living, and whether you were indeed my son. Iaving clear proofs that you are indeed my son, I presented myself to you as your father; and strange as it may seemn, the porter of your bank is the identical man to whom I offered several acres of land for a saddle and an old hat, on the very evening when I left home in such haste."       r "He has related to me the incident, and little did I then think that the hatless and saddleless rider was my father.

"Thank the Lord that I have lived to see the day that ,- you again communicate with the parents of your wife!" said  Peter. And he was about to commence to make his obser-  vation, when, Otto cut him short. "Not now, Peter; just  take this letter as quickly as possible."  Peter delivered the letter to Mrs. La Monte, who read the contents very carefully, and could hardly suppress her wrath. "Tell Mr. Wellen that Mr. La Monte is out hav- ing his lmorning walk. As soon as he comes home, I will hand him the letters." "Is there no other answer?" asked Peter timidly. "No," was the abrupt response. And Mrs. La Monte turned her back to Peter, rang the bell violently three times  in succession-a sign for the coachman.         I Jim hurried into the room, and with an obedient bow said, "Maldam, I am at your service." "Quick, bring the carriage! You will drive with the same precaution, crossing and recrossing the streets, so that none can conveniently follow, and then stop at that house, -you know."                       ' "Yes, madam," and Jim waited as if expecting something. Mrs. La Monte opened her pocket-book, and gave him a  ten-dollar bill, which Jim accepted with glowing eyes, and a hearty "Thank you, madam." As he left, Mrs. La Monte said, "If I had given him only five dollars, he would not have been half so quick and polite. When one has to bribe servants to keep their mistress's secrets, it takes a good deal of money. I have plenty. My  parents left me plenty of money, and I mean to use it as I please."   OR, OUR DESTINY.        335 Mrs. La Monte was hardly dressed, when Jim was ready ,vith the carriage, whip in hand, to touch up the horses and make them trot at their utmost speed. Mr. La Monte entered his house just in time to see his wife driving away in great haste; and he thought, "What do these post-haste rides mean? I questioned Jim where he drove, and he seemed confused. Always when I am away from home my wife takes a ride. Where can she go?"He reflected a moment, and cold perspiratiori gathered on his brow. He hastened to his room, took out of his drawer a revolver, nicely loaded for immediate action, ,and exclaimed with clenched teeth, "Woe to him who is trying to win away the affections of my wife! he may consider himself a dead mans Thank God that my hand is again steady and I am as good a shot as ever! I will pierce with a bullet the heart that tries to pierce mine with dishonor. - Woe to him! woe to him! he may consider himself a dead man. Now to horse, to horse!"With a firm step he walked to the stable, saddled his horse, and in a 1moment was following, at a safe distance, the carriage of his wife. His suspicion grew stronger within him as he noticed the precautionary wind- ings made by the driver. Passing by a livery stable, herode in and cried to the carriage washer, "Quick! off with your rubber boots, your slouched hat, and give me that rubber blanket! Do not hesitate 1 I will amply reward you when 1 come back." When again Mr. John James La Monte ap- peared on the street his oldest acquaintances would not have recognized him. He again followed his wife's carriage, iwho suddenly stopped before a dingy-looking house. He saw his wife step into the house quickly. He dismounted and stepped into a grocery store adjoining the dingy: house. "Do you sell Schweitzer cheese?" "Ya wohl, ya wohl ;" and the storekeeper lifted the cover y a  Nv ohl  - a n    &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7121-00000169"/> 336     "THE FORGIVIYVG KISS"      , off sonme American-made cheese, which he offered as Schweitzer. Tasting the cheese he said, "Give me two pounds, but cut it into thin slices." The grocer jumped to sell two  pounds of the American cheese at Schweitzer price. This suited him well, and even attracted the attention of the grocer's wife.  "Who lives in the adjoining house? and what kind of pco- ple are they?" The grocer was about to answer, when his wife interrupted him, exclaiming, "Hans, du dummer Kerl, schweig!" Not a word did the grocer speak, but looked at his wife  as if to say, -"You answer then." "Those, are nice peoples living in the next housei nice peoples." "What business do they follow?" asked Mr. La Monte, in a quiver. "What you say?" "What do they do to make a living " ' They make a living with the money they earn." "But in what manner do they earn the money?" ' Ah, dat ish none of my business; is it yours?  "That Dutch woman is too sharp for me; let me take the bull' by the horns, and go into the back part of the house: there I shall no doubt soon find out what kind of a house it is." And Mr. La Monte, paying for the cheese, stepped by the side entrance into the adjoining house, and addressed the servant. "Can I see the mistress of the house immedi- ately? Here is a dollar, go and call her at once." The dollar made the servant attentive, so he quickly ainswered, "I fear you cannot see my mistress, for she has just re-  ' ceived one of her best customers, who seems to be made of money."   OR, OUR DESTINY.        337 "And what is she coming here for?" asked Mr. La Monte in an alnost trembling voice. "My mistress is the celebrated Madame Endor, who is a fortune-teller, and famliliar with spirits. She is having a seance, a sitting with her wealthy customer." "Thank God that it is only a spiritual den and a bogus Witch of Endor who has bewitched my wife! These spiritual dens are conducted by sharpers and visited by knaves and fools. Let me make use of the sharpers, and teach nmy wife a lesson which will last her for life." And he took a piece of paper and wrote with pencil: "GREAT CLAIRVOYANTE: "Your reputation for reading the future in the stars, and your divine power to call up the slirits, has even reached my master, 1Mr. John Jolies La Monte, President of the Busy Bank, who has sent me to request you to call to-mor- row, precisely at ten A M., at his bank.

Giving the letter to the servant, and receiving assurance that it would be promptly delivered, Mr. La Monte hastened back, mounted his horse, returned the borrowed clothes, gave the man the cheese lie purchased, and a dollar be- sides, and returned to his honme, comnpleting his plan of mak- ing good use of Madame Endor. The next mrorning,-at precisely ten o'clock, Madame llndor enltered the private office of President La Monte, who received the great clairvoyante with urbanity, saying, "Have I indeed the honor to receive Madame EnLdor, who rivals in wxitchcraft the historical Witch of Endor?" 15  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7121-00000170"/> 338     "THE F ORGIVING KISS;"  "' I am a lineal descendant of that great spiritualist whose aid Saul sought, and who brought before him the spirit of Samuel, Israel's greatest prophet."

But as for me, a business man, who has seen the world from different standpoints, you cannot make me believe for a moment that you are a lineal descendant of the Witch of Endor. And do not flatter yourself that I believe in your power of reading the future in the stars, or of calling up the spirits and receiving of them information of the past or of the future. This is all good enough for the credulous: it  amuses the silly and stupid, whose wish being father to their thoughts, you can dupe at pleasure. And as you are such a great artist in deception, I wish to avail myself of your juggling," said Mr. John James La Monte, sarcastically but earnestly. Madame Endor rose froim her seat with a theatrical mien. "Sir! sir!" exclaimed she, "what do you take me-" 6Be seated! No scene, no nonsense! If you do not immnediately sit down quietly and assume your serious busi- ness looks, you are not as able as I took you to be, and I cannot employ you. To be employed by me is to be richly remunerated for work faithfully rendered." Madame Endor took her seat quietly, and said, "I see that you mean business, and not a pious fraud." "You have guessed it admirably," said Mr. La Monte, handing Madame Endor carefully written instructions, with  the remark, "Read these, and after you know the contents, state candidly whether you -can carry them out, and what reward you expect for your services." Madaime Endor read the elaborate instructions with great ! attention, aud when she finished, said, "I can carry out    OR0 OUR DESTINY.        339 the whole, provided Mrs. La Monte will go to the grave- yard you indicate, and you can furnish the grave-diggers.

If you cannot accomplish that, you have not as much power over the lady as I supposed. .As for the grave-diggers, they shall be there, and the price charged will be paid to you after a faithful performance,"  answered Mr. La Monte. "Yes, I can induce Mrs. La Monte to go even to the  graveyard at midnight. She believes implicitly in all I  I say."  "Are you sure of your assertion being correct?"  ' Beyond a doubt," was the prompt response. "Can you remember the instructions?"  "Perfectly."  " Then indorse on the instructions, 'In consideration of five hundred dollars, I herewith agree to carry out the within instructions to the very letter,' and sign your name." This the madame readily wrote, and handed the docu-  ment to Mr: John James La MAonte, who placed it in his coat breast-pocket, saying, "Two days hence you can call for the five hundred dollars, provided you have accomplished the scene well." "It would please me if you would also give it to me in  ' writing that I am entitled to that sum," said Madame Endor. "My word is as good as my bond," answered Mr. La Monte, making a motion that the audience was at an end.

What a shame that she, as, the wife, should not have such scruples!"But only let me this time see what Madame Endor will learn from my ancestors, whether they are in favor of Viola's divorce from Otto Wellen, and W'hether it is a possibility for Viola to marry the Count Carl Von Mardeck. I know that Rosalind cannot be induced to marry the Count." Turning to Jim, she said, "I admit that you run the risk of being discharged; I therefore hand you here a twenty-dollar bill as a present." "Well, to please my lady, I will undertake it, and, as a precaution, will bind straw around the wheels," remarked Jim, bowing himself out of the room, saying as he went,  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7121-00000172"/> 342     'THE FORGIVING KISS; " "I am determined to feather my nest before I leave this house, where they have so much money that they do not know what to do with it.

I- wonder what she wants to do in the graveyard at midnight ? That old wrinkled-up witch of a woman, Madame Endor, put her up tb those notions-I presume to get a good pile of money out of her. I would be a fool if I did not try to finger some of it myself." It was near midnight when Mrs. La Monte noiselessly left her house, stepped into her carriage, and rode in great expectation to be artistically duped. Mrs. La Monte was hardly gone, when Mr. La Monte arose from his couch, dressed, and mounted his horse and followed hlis wife's carriage. He was not gone far when he observed Madame Endor step from a house on the road, and enter his wife's carriage. Seeing her he said, "Tlhe she-devil is on tinme, like all mischief-makers: it is well. Mrs. La Monte shall receive her deserved lesson for having intercourse with such a swindler. Were it a man, the bullet of my pistol would have penetrated the heatit and the skull of the- damnable object "    He spurred on the horse, and on reaching the churchyard dismounted, and kept at a safe distance. In the graveyard were two grave-diggers with their picks and shovels, those instruments which have been made wet with many burning tears of grief, as they were used to cover up the remains of a dear father, of a dear mother, of a dear brother, of a dear sister, of a darling child, of a devoted friend, or a hero who fought the great battle to better the -condition of humanlity-those instruments were now used in revelry. "Well, Clement," said one of'the grave-diggers, "what   OR, OUR DLES TI'I.       343  would you do if you had a wife who needed such a dose as  .  the husband has prepared for her?"   - "What would I do?

Let us act our part well, and help him to restore his wife to the proper duties of a true woman and a true wife." "I agree with you in all you have said, except getting rid of such a wife by legal means. It is far better for the husband to keep struggling on to the last, and hope on that his wife may yet listen to his advice and submit to his guidance. If it should prove after all a fruitless effort, then let him have on his death-bed the satisfaction of having done his  duty; of having saved his children from scandal, and know- ing that he has for their sake, and for the sake of society,  suffered the pangs of deep mortification, and let him wel-  colle death as his best friend, who timely came to close his  earthly existence, and release his soul to roam in the heav-  enly regions, to enjoy the reward for its earthly sufferings.

In time to come she will think of her noble husband who often implored her to avoid the snares of falsehood, and cling to truth; to be a wife not only in name, but in fact; but to whose words she was deaf and scornful. These recollections will be worse than deatli. She will live to be despised by her children, by her relatives, by her former -friends, by the community at large. Her body like her character will shrink into nothingness, and even her soul, when released from the despised body, will be so small that it will not be able to soar high ulp into the heavenly regions. Slle was unworthy to live on earth with her husband, she will be unworthy to meet him in the spir- itual regions. Hark! they are coming!" and both the grave-diggers quickly put on the emblems of the dead, and laid flat in the open coffin. They were hardly placed, when Madame Endor and Mrs. John James La Monte appeared  on the ground. "Hold fast to my hand," said Madame Endor; "do not tremble so: keep quiet. I will now summon the spirits to fill the body with life, and you shall soon see and hear your grandfather and your grandmother Bottwell speak. Do not tremble so, Mrs. La Monte. If you are so much afraid, why did you come? You have chosen to come of your own free will. In the future, think before you act, look before you leap," said Madame Endor, irritably.  "MTy husband would not dare to talk to me thus, as Madame Endor does.

"I see nothing," answered Mrs. La Monte bravely.  "You are blind with fear. See! see! They are nearing  their graves. Let us make a few steps ahead; perhaps you can see them then ;" and Madame Endor almost pulled Mrs.  La Monte forward, and exclaimed again: "Ye spirits whom   i I have called up, rise and give your grandchild, Theodosia ! Bottwell, now Mrs. John La Monte, advice; rise, ye  spirits, rise!"  At a distance the sounding of a muffled drum was heard, and the grave-diggers arose as -Peter Bottwell, and Hecta  Bottwell, his wife, wrapped in white sheeting. "Matches  matches!" was the shrill cry of Hecta Bottwell. "Soap- gra  so-gease soa-gease!" said the gruff voice of Peter Bott- well. "Soap-grease for a piece of soap; soap-grease!" re- peated he. Hecta Bottwell repeated "Matches! matches!" and stooping as if looking into a pile of refuse to pick up a rag or a bone. "For God's sake! were your ancestors soap-grease gath- erers, and rag-pickers, and match-pedlers, or did the wrong spirits answer my summons? Speak quick!" said Madame Endor in a commanding tone. "Alas! they were what they now appear to be. Let it    . go no further; keep it to yourself," begged the humbled  womlan. h 'w Mr. and Mrs. Bottwell, the founders of the house of Pottwell, your grandchild Theodosia is in distress about  marrying her daughters.

Soap-grease! soap-grease i " was the united exclamation. "Madame Endor, take me away!" implored Mrs. La Monte. "I dare not. I have invoked their advice and aid, and we must hear, or we must run the risk of being torn to pieces. "I, the lineal descendant of the Witch of Endor, called you up not to reproach, but to advise and aid your grand- child in the wishes of her heart." "We advise her not to be so vain, not to be so foolish as to make of everybody her confidant, and priding herself on her wealth. Not to spend so much of it to adorn her body. Let her do something for the benefit of the spirit, adorn the spirit with a multitude of good deeds. Let Theo- dosia devote a share of her wealth and her time to alleviate  the sufferings of humanity. The peacock has a beautiful plumage, yet it is a bird not half so beneficial to mankind as the unpretending hen ; true, it cackles after it has laid an egg. ILet Theodosia follow the example of the hen in ! its humility: drop golden eggs which will feed the hungry and give strength to the feeble. This is a brighter plumage than the peacock's tail, that shines only to arouse envy and anger; the other arouses gratitude and blessings. As for m1arrying her daughters, let them marry the choice of their hearts if they choose well, they will live well. As for  counts, lords, barons, and princes, there are none except  those who are nature's noblemen, and they are often found in the humble walks of life, dressed in the garb of the poor." The muffled drum was again heard, and the spirits disap- peared. In almost a fainting condition did Mrs. John James La Monte, the born Bottwell, reach her carriage: a hum- bled, if not a wiser woman. * -,   OR, OUR DESTINY.        347 Mr.. La Monte, who overheard the whole conversation, mounted his horse and rode quickly home, well pleased with the perfoirmance. "It was well done, and 1 hope the piece will work satisfactorily." Mrs. ,a Monte entered her room almost broken-hearted, and looked upol her sleeping husband with admiration, saying  ' Yes, I, wretched being, the grandchild of a soap-grease gatherer, a rag-picker, and match-pedler, am indeed un- worthy to be his wife. How he has borne up under my un- reasonable temrper, my false pride, my secrets which I kept from him! I am ashamed of myself. The way in which I have maltreated her, poor Rosalind ; how much sorrow did I uselessly cause her! How that sycophant Hulda made a fool of me! What a narrow escape I had of falling into the hands of the Jesuits! And this Madame Endor, is she not a second sycophant? Hulda only in another form? Let me henceforth avoid temptations, avoid the snares which the wicked so invitingly spread before one wherever one turns. Let me be a true woman , a true wife. Let me hold on fast to the advice of my husband ; with all his faults, he is after all my best friend. Let me overlook his shortcomings with the same grace lhe overlooks mine, and let me live with him in an affectionate union. This is man and woman's true destiny. Those who fail to fulfil that destiny are doomed to misery." Slowly she unrobed, and cautiously stepped into the bed for fear of awakening her husband, who feigned sleep, but who quietly listened to his wife's self-accusation and resolution to be a better woman. At 1his usual hour in the morning Mr. La Monto arose, dressed hilmself, breakfasted, and then attended carefully to his plants; and after clipping a rose and a few leaves of geranium, he neatly tied them into a bouquet, placed it in the buttonhole of his coat, and gayly stepped into his bed-  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7121-00000175"/> 348     "THSLE FORGIVING KISS;"            i room to get the keys of the safe. His wife complained of a severe indisposition, and begged him to stop on his way and request Dr. Dettman to come immediately to give her some relief, and adding with a sigh, "John, would you not be glad if I were already gathered to my fathers? I am such a contrary wife, such a big trouble, such a drawhack to your real happiness. I almostwish myself dead. I am not worthy to live and be your wife, you are so much my superior in wisdom, in experience, in dignity, in goodness of heart, in forbearance. You stand so much higher in the scale of perfection, that I ani nothing compared to you. Your patience with my whims and unreasonableness must have demanded of you heroic efforts. . You are a hero to have borne up under such a crushing load. Forgive me, husband; I promise you that henceforth I will be a good and dutiful wife, and gladly acquiesce in all that you pro- pose. I will dress as you direct. I will associate only with those whom you think worthy. I will attend regularly to religious services. I will not be proud, I will be more char- itable. I will no longer lament over Viola's marriage to Otto Wehlen ; I will no longer oppose Rosalind's marriage to Charles Hunting. I think that my opposition was all folly, for 'Man proposes, and God disposes.' Kiss me, John, and say that you are not angry with me." The husband complied readily with the reasonable re- quest, and for the first time during his wedded life, received a kiss from his wife that came from the heart of hearts. "I am glad that you see yourself as others see you," said Mr. La Monte, "and seeing yourself as you really are, you F cannot but improve in your conduct. Have you any mes- sage to Otto and Viola? I'shall see them this forenoon."  "Give them my love, dear, and tell them that as soon as  I am able, I will visit them and spend a day. Kiss then  for me as my dear children; please take a kiss for them    OR, OUR DESTINY.        349 and one for you;" and Mrs. La Monte'again impressed two hearty kisses on her husbanld's lips. "Theodosia, I was not aware that you could kiss so sweetly, and be as sweet as you are this morning." With these words Mr. La Monte started down town, stopped at Doctor Dettmian's office, who was about getting ready to make his usual morning calls to patients who were really sick and patients who thought they were. "Anything se- rious? " asked the doctor. No 3 spiritualism lias unnerved her." "I will be there directly, and, try to cure her of that malady."  "Do please, doctor, do." On reaching the bank, Madame Endor was already wait- ing. "Excuse me for being five minutes late. Be seated; I will be back directl." He stepped into the banking- hall, told the teller to givelhim one thousand-dollars in fifty- dollar bills. Receiving the money, he at once returlned to his private office, and gave Madame Endor five hundred dollars. He withdrew fronm his wallet the same doclument of instructions, saying, "You will please write your receipt on this," which the madame readily complied with, exclaim- ing, "Thank you, sir! thank you, sir!  Ia again at your service, sir," repeated the madame in quick succes- sion. "I will lhave no further need of your services, and I ad- vise you as a friend to retire from this nefarious business, or you run the risk of coming in contact with the police." I understand; as long as I do not admit Mrs. La Monte into my premises, I am safe from molestation." Mvr. La Monte made no reply, waved his hand, which the madame clearly comprehended, and with a polite adieu left, never to reappear in this book. Let her serve as a warning to those who are inclined to visit such swindlers,  &#xD;<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC7121-00000176"/> 350     "THE FORGIVING KISS;" star-seers, spiritualists, and humbugs of the same category. They are shams, and many of theni rascals of the deepest dye, who can blast one's good'character, and throw the un- fortunate victim into the deepest pit of impurity in the shortest space of time. Avoid those glitteringserpents if you value your reputation, your peace of mind; and if you abhor bad society, you will heed the advice of the author of "Our Destiny." Dr. Dettman made a polite bow as he entered the room of Mrs. La Monte. "Rosalind," said he, "please open the shutters so that I can see better; my eyes are growing somewhat dim. Not from weeping. imortifying tears-no! for I am a haply man. I possess God's best gift to man- a good, truthful wife, who watches over my honor and my  interests with that attention which only a holy love can dic- tate. Blessed be she! I am doing my best to have her enjoy all that which intelligence combined with wealth can procure. The benignant influence of a good wife cannot be described, for it embraces the universe." All this was said by the doctor as if he were speakling ith himself. Mrs. La Monte half thought that the good old doctor was getting childish. "Please let me feel your pulse. You have a slight ner- vous prostration. Have you been reading? and up to what hours?" asked the doctor, watching the lady atten- tively, for long practice had taught him that many of his patients do not speak the truth. "I have been reading a little, but not late." And what kind of books are you reading?" "Works on spiritualism," was the prompt reply. "Well, madam, I as the family physician positively for- bid you to read any such works, or to attend to any spiritual s6ances; for, if you have not yet been unnerved you will .be, and the result will be that in a few short: months your fin-    OR, OUR DESTINY.        351 ily will be obliged to place you in an insane asylum. Mad- am, I have attended you since your childhood, and through your obedience to my mandates you have preserved splen- did health. I now repeat that you are not to read, speak, or speculate upon spiritualism. Will you observe my comn- mands?" asked the doctor in an earnest tone. "I will, doctor, for it must be dreadful to be the inmate of an insane asylum," answered Mrs. La Monte earnestly. ' You promise faithfully?" "I do, doctor." "Then I will prescribe for you. You will take this medicine every two hours, drink lemonade, and keep quiet in your bed; and I think that by to-morrow you will be able to attend the grand reception given by King Octavius the First." "We have received no invitation as yet," exclaimed Mrs. La Monte, in an eager tone. 'Perhaps the invitation was sent to your husband, who forgot it in his coat pocket," answered the doctor. "That would be just like him. I have a good mind to send Jim down town ;" and she was about to ring the bell. "Do not, madam, for if your husband did not receive the invitation it may put him into a bad humor, and a wife qught to be careful not to get her husband into a bad humor; it is unpleasant to have a husband in ill humor: it often leads to disastrous ends." "A wife is a perfect slave," exclaimed Mrs. La Monte. "A wife is a queen if she is wise, and a slave if she is thoughtless, or better say, foolilsh. A wise wife directs all her attention not to irritate her husband, not to load him with unnecessary cares ; if anything, she lightens them, and he goes forth with a lighter load to fight manfully the great battle of life. He knows it, acknowledges it, and esteems her With all the veneration of noble manhood. She is his  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7121-00000177"/> 352     "TIlE FORGIVING KISS;" queen; in his heart she reigns, and she is respected, loved, and adorned as tl;e regent of the house. On the other hand, the thoughtless or foolish wife is unreasonable in her de- mands: the more the merrier ; 'I want this, and I want that; I must have this, and I must have that; I will associate with whom 1 please; I will read just such newspapers and books as suit me, I don't care what you and the world say. I am not a slave, and I will not be a slave because I am married; I will do just as I please.' Madam, you will quickly observe that she is a slave-a slave of her whims, of her passions, which lead her from one folly into another; which make her ridiculous in the eyes of her husband, and the world in general. She feels miserable, and finds relief only in the presence of flatterers who flatter her for selfish motives, until they get her within their power; then, indeed, is she a complete slave, and wretched her end.

'Turning to Rosalind, he said: "You have asked me solme time ago how many years it takes for a human firame  to be entirely renewed. Some physicians of eminence have asserted that it took seven years, but according to late  theories it does not take longer than eighteen months, and according to my calculation, it takes only fifteen months.  1 presume if your parents receive an invitation to the re- ception of King Octavius the First, you will be there also.   OR, OUR DES7zNY.        353  The Hunting family have been invited, and will be there,  and so too your humble servant with my queen ; and I will  i have pleasure in introducing her to you." "The pleasure will be highly appreciated," answered Rosalind. "Will the queen of Iing Octavius be there too?" asked Mrs. La Monte. "No, the poor queen is dead. She has earned the repu-   I tation of having been very amiable. The royal pair have   . only one son, and it is reported that he will be present on this august occasion," answered the doctor. "Is the Prince single or married?" inquired Mrs. La  Monte.  To which the doctor made no reply.  "I hope that we shall be invited to the reception; if not, Mr. La Monte must try to obtain an invitation, for I never saw a king or prince in my life. I would like to see what a king or a prince looks like." The doctor made his usual courteous bow and left, say- ing, sotto voce: " 1 have cured Mrs. La Monte of spiritu- alism ; it will be a treat to me to see when she learns who King Octavius and the Prince are." In every fashionable family the reception of King Octa- vius was the theme of conversation. To have received an invitation to that great event was indeed an honor; only the Elite were to be there; it was to be a gala night, on which the ladies were to appear to their best advantage. No expense was spared, and all the dry-goods, fancy goods, and jewelry stores were crowded with busy buyers; the price was no object, if only the quality were superior. The tailors and dressmakers were all very busy; and the hair- dealers and hair-dressers cane in also for a fair share of pat- ronage. They all wished that a king, or some royal  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7121-00000178"/> 354      THE FORRGIVrING KISS ; prince, would often visit the city and give a reception: it enlivened business. The new hotel was grandly illuminated, and equipage after equipage arrived with happy occupants, looking like noble knights, like heroes of a thousand battles, with their charm- ing princesses at their sides looking as happy as fairy queens. The spacious reception-hall of the grand edifice was bril- liantly lighted, and presented one of those dazzling scenes which one can only behold on special public occasions, in a city of culture, of wealth, and happy harmony, where all en- deavor to conquer their prejudices, to bury their cares in the workshop and counting-room, and make the best of their leisure hours and their homes. The band of one hundred well-cultivated instruments, under an able baton, enlivened the scene to a still greater perfection. At the head of the room stood King Octavius the First, dressed in the Ameri- can evening costume; there was only one star on the lappel of his coat, set in such marvellous diamonds and other costly jewels, that it almost outshone the thousand lights of the spacious hall. On his right stood Otto Wehlen, and on his left Mrs. Otto Wehlen, looking the prettiest and happiest of all present. The first of the visitors who called was Caleb Rusha Titus, with his wife and the minister of his church, whom, since his reform, he had liked and admired for his great sermons--"Thou shalt not covet," and that on "Forgiveness." On reaching the point where his brother stood, he said, "My royal brother, I present to you my dear  wife, who has instructed me to give you, in her behalf, and in behalf of our daughter Susan, most grateful thanks for your kindness toward them. Accept also my own sincere thanks. And to you, my dear nephew, who Ihave also so very kindly treated my daughter Susan, I herewith hand you a perfect title to your land opposite the lark. May you  live long in the midst of your family to enjoy it, andtavor   OR, OUR DESTINzY.        355 me and mine with your Nxisits to our country home; we will all feel very happy to receive you and yours. Susan begs to be excused for not coming, as she is in deep mourn- ing." Viola was very happy indeed to make the acquaintance of her uncle and aunt, and would hope herself to visit her cousin Susan soon. Mr. and Mrs. Edward Hunting, with their sons, daughters, and their husbands, and Mrs. Ida Lothimore, now made their alpearance, and exchanged the courtesies of the occasion. Dr. Dettman and his estimable wife were very gracefully re- ceived. Mrs. Otto Wehlen kissed the doctor as a token of gratitude for his priceless services. Squire Titus seemed lost, and, looking about, he recog- nized the reporter who had lectured him in the office of the chief of police. "Say, stranger, have I not seen you at the-office of the chief of police somne time ago?" "Yes. -I believe your name is Caleb Rusha Titus?" "Yes, that is my name. Can you tell me, sir, who is that handsome youing gentleman with that elderly lady with white lace on her head?" "That is Mr. Charles Hunting and Mrs. Ida Lothimore. Mr. Hunting delivered an eloquent lecture before the Young Men's Christian Association. He is one of the most promis- ing young men in the city. Mrs. Ida Lothimore has given one hundred thousand dollars to be loaned out in limited sulms to worthy mechanics, at a very small rate of interest. She is a philanthropist, God bless her!" At this juncture, Mr. and Mrs. John James La Monte and Miss Rosalind La Monte and her brother Winfred entered the assembly. Many stepped aside to make room for the elegant couple and their beautiful daughter. "Who is that ' asked Squire Titus.  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7121-00000179"/> 356     "THE FORGIVING KISS;"           , t"That is Mr. and Mrs. John James La Monte and their brilliant daughter Rosalind." "Who is that gentleman with that lady on his arm, look- ing so closely at the buttons of his coat?" "That is his Honor the MXayor, and his wife, who no doubt is afraid that some of the office-hunters will again tear some of the buttons off his coat.. Poor man! Poor woman! they have no peace : the office-hunters are after them wher- ever they go." "Who are those gentlemen that now came in a group? They seem to walk with measured dignity." "They comprise a board of trustees, under whose direc- tion a great railroad will be built. If they do their work faithfully they will no doubt have the greatest monument  erected by the citizens of this city that has ever been erected for public benefactors in my country. God speed the work!" "Who is that tall gentleman surrounded by other gentle- men, also of noble bearing?" "That is the president of the Park Commissioners and his colleagues. You see that gentleman to his right, with the well-shaped head and gray mustache? he is' one of his ablest lieutenants; he has, by changing the location of one avenue, saved to the city sixty thousand dollars. Such a service deserves grateful recognition." "Who is that gentleman with that waxed mustache, and witl large rings on his watch-chain?" "'That gentleman is the Napoleon of photographers; and the gentleman who is walking with him is Julius Solomon, also an artist of great note." Mrs. La Monte thought that she was 'in heaven; it was the proudest day of her life to be presented to a king! to a prince! She bowed nearly to the very floor, and hardly dared to lift her eyes up to the "royal son;" but at the words, "Allow me to introduce to you my son," she thought   OR, OUR DESYINY.        357 she would raise her eyes and look at the Prince. Her aston- ishment could be better imagined than described. She ex- claimed: "Why, it is Otto, the son of Mrs. Wehlen!" "Mrs. Wehlen was my Queen," answered the King. "Alas! that she lives no more to share with me the joy of this evening." "Mother," exclaimed Viola, " little did I dream, when I married Otto, that he was a prince, for my father-in-law is a king!" "Happy, happy child! I congratulate you; I congratu- late myself that such is the fact; but be it as it may, I am glad that you have wedded Otto. He is a noble man, be he prince or peasant." Rosalind was delighted to see her sister so well and happy. That her husband was the son of a king did not make so much difference to her. "If they are only well and happy as man and wife, that is the first consideration; the title is a seconda ry matter." Grandfather Hunting now made his appearance. He looked hale and hearty; his bright eyes shone with happi- ness as he observed Miss Rosalind La Monte, and after having made his bow before the royal host, he asked Rosa- lind whether she had seen Charles. "I have not had the pleasure of seeing your grandson," answered Rosalind, witfi a blush. ' I must go and hunt him up and bring him here. You must make it up! you must make it up! He loves you, and I hope you love him; " and before Rosalind could  make a reply, the sprightly old gentleman was gone, and in a few moments brought Charles, blooming with health, cult- ure, and manly strength. "Miss Rosalind, Dermit me to introdulce to you my grandson, Charles Hunting, the costhest jewel of my heart,  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7121-00000180"/> 353     "1'E7t FORCG VIG KIS S;"   *      .  tle brightest feather in my cap. Receive him as the noblest : of men," said the grandfather. "I am not a stranger to Miss Rosalind, although I have not had the pleasure of seeing the noble lady for some time."  "Not so formal, not so formal, Charles," repeated the grandfather': "you have been school-fellows. Formality is unnecessary; be plain. Out with the words that are so near your heart; join hearts and hands, and I will give you mly blessing." The young couple blushed deeply, which the grandfather observed, and said, "In these modern times boys and girls court in a different way from that of my youth; I will leave you now." And the old man disappeared well satisfied with his evening's work. Mr. Charles Hunting offered Miss Rosalind his arm, which the young lady accepted with her natural grace. As they promenaded the hall, they were the admired of all ad- mirers. ' What a beautiful couple they will make!" was the general remark. In their promenade they met Dr. Dettman, who introduced his queen. "Mrs. Dettman, it would have done your heart good if you had heard how the good doctor praised you a few days ago to my mother. I am glad of the honor of having made your personal acquaintance, and hope that you will honor us with a call." "It does my heart good to see you, Rosalind, walking arm in arm so affectionately with Charlie. I must have the first piece of the wedding-cake." ' Dr. Dettman!" exclaimed Mrs. Dettman.  "Never mind; that is all right, or it will be all right, I hope, in a very short time. I repeat, the first piece of weddingt-cake I must and will have."           , "So shall it be; aye, Miss Rosalind," exclaimed Mr. ;             -      :?

"We will leave you. to solve the riddle;" and the doctor with his wife bowed themselves away. The adjoining hall was now opened for dancing, xwhich commienced with that graceful dance, the quadrille, in which four pair formed a group. Mr. and Mrs. La Monte, Mr. and Mrs. Otto Wehlen, Mr. and Mrs. Dr. DettmLan, and Mr. Charles Hunting and Miss Rosalind La Monte figured among the mnany elegant groups in the room. Dr. Dettman requested Rosalind to give him quickly some hints about the dance. In his youth the waltz was his favorite; he had not of late danced imuch,'and they must not laugh at him if he made mistakes. The music struck up. Mrs. La Monte made one of her grandest bows before Mr. Otto Wehlen; was he not a prince? Her cup of happiness was now indeed full. Mr. Charles Hunting too will lmake'a splendid son-in-law, and her husband looked as well-preserved and dignified as any one of the gentlemen present. She was indeed a happy wife and mother; all she needed was tQ be less proud and more amliable and charitable, and that she firmly resolved to be.  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7121-00000181"/> 36o0      TIIE FORGIVING KISS;7" Before the happy party broke up, Rosalind La Monte was the betrothed of Charles Hunting. Both parents gave a glad assent, but none were happier than Grandfather Hunting and Dr. Dettman; the grandfather declared that  his son-in-law Charles deserved to have the best and pretti- est girl in the city-nay, in the whole world, for a wife ; and  Dr. Dettman pleaded that Rosalind deserved to have one of nature's true noblemen as her husband. "It is a splen- did match ; they will make a happy couple." Mr. and Mrs. John James La Monte resolved to present to the bride and groom a house completely furnished. Rosalind begged her parents fo build on Rox Street, ad- joining her sister Viola's, so that she could live near her; "and beside that, the street," she said, " was so nicely sit- uated: it. had the atmosphere of the country, and all the conveniences of the city." "Certainly, my child, certainly; we will buy the house wherever you wish to have it; if you are pleased, we are  pleased; if you are happy, we are happy," said Mrs. La ; MTonte.               .' "But will the house be grand enough? for it will not be . in good taste to build a grander house than Otto's," said Mr. La Monte. "That style of a house just suits me ; it contains all the necessary improvements, so simply arranged that it can be taken care of without the aid of many servants. Charlie and I have talked over how we shall live, and we both re- solved to live plainly; to enjoy all the comforts quietly without ostentation; be only the plain Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hunting, but always at home to receive worthy visitors, and aid worthy objects," said Rosalind, happiness beaming in her beautiful eyes, and her whole being radiant with joy. "God bless you, my darling daughter!" said Mr. La   OR, OUR DESTINY.       36 Monte; and he added: "I will at once go and make the necessary arrangements for buying a lot, and have the house built and ready for occupancy within two months from to- day; and then you can be married at the church, and from there drive at once to your own house, and the same evening give a reception to your friends. There will be no wedding feast and no bridal tour. Traveling sours the temper of the most experienced; how much more must it put a young couple in a bad humor with each other, and by the time they get ready to go to housekeeping, they are no longer one in sentiment, but watch and enlarge upon each other's faults with the sharpness of a practical lawyer. No; being married and having your house furnished, go to house- keeping at once, and enjoy there the honeymoon." "Why, Mr. La Monte, your remarks surprise me. I thought that you would make the wedding of your daughter Rosalind the grandest that was ever seen or heard of on the continent," exclaimed Mrs. La Monte in an angry tone. "Theodosia, did you not assure me that you would henceforth not be so vain, that vanity leads into error, and a grand wedding is only vanity, and nothing else? To abridge vanity is a religious duty which we owe to ourselves and to our fellow-men; we will therefore not make a grand wedding, and I hope that the young couple will set the ex- ample of going to housekeeping at once, and not travel over half the land as a recreation, which is in fact a fa- tigue." "I for one will follow pa's suggestion, if Charley will co- incide with my views. We will make no wedding trip," said Rosalind. "This does not answer my expectation," said Mrs. La Monte, "but as a good wife and mother I will make no ob- jection."  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7121-00000182"/> 362     "T sE FzORGIVING KISS;"  Mr. La Monte, with his usual promptness, instructed a real estate agent to buy one hundred feet front on Rox Street, giving him the exact lots wanted, at as reasonable a, price as possible. A builder was called, and a bargain closed, with the condition that the house must be ready within six weeks, allowing two weeks for the paint to dry  and to furnish it; all the furniture was ordered, which of  course was handsome, serviceable and, good, and of the rich- est design. In two months the marriage ceremony of Mr. Charles   F Hunting to Miss Rosalind La Monte took place in one of the most capacious churches in the city; which was, how-  ever, filled with the friends and admirers of the handsome couple. The grand organ again sounded those happy tones of Mendelssohn's grand Wedding March, and when the bridegroom and the bride entered and walked up to the altar, there was an unanimous expression: "Perfect! what a manly bridegroom! what a lovely bride! the prettiest that  was ever seen in this church!" The minister, after making a few appropriate remarks, joined their hands in wedlock; and Mr. and Mrs. Charles Hunting drove to their cosey home on Rox Street, where   . they gave a reception to their numerous relatives and friends. The Young Men's Christian Association walked up in a body to congratulate the happy pair who had taken  the first earnest step toward fulfilling "Our Destiny," to , have a home of their own in which to bring up men and women to be ministering angels to humanity with godlike wisdom, with godlike love, with godlike justice, with godlike forbearance, charity, and grace, causing sunshine wherever their influence reaches: and it should be so extensive as to reach all over the earth. To have such a progeny is worthy of the grandest effort of every father and of every mlother in this wide universe, and   OR, OUR DESTINE        363 to which it behooves the State to give its cordial and liberal aid to help mankind to become emancipated fronm its brute. burden, namely, unrestrained passions, false gods, false theories, false modes of living, and become one united brotherhood who live in peace and harmony; every family living in their own house, enjoying all the blessings of life wVhich God has so bountifully showered on His children, to be enjoyed but not abused. Grandfather H-unting arrived, and notwithstanding his age of threescore and ten, he jumped from the carriage as lightly and happily as a young man of twenty. He has evi- dently enjoyed, but not abused, life. If you too, reader, faithfully resolve to use and not abuse life, you too can ex- lect to live to a good old age, with your health unimpaired,  and enjoy the privilege of congratulating your. grandchildren on their wedding-day, as Grandfather Tlunting did. -He took their hands in his own, and said: "My dear grand- children, this is the greatest day of your life; upon which I congratulate you, and deem it proper to impress on your minds to remember that the best friend a husband has is his wife, and the best friend a wife has is her husband. Try to be always worthy of each other's confidence and love;  balish unworthy thoughts, for unworthy thoughts are apt to lead to unworthy deeds, which may cost you your self- respect; and without self-respect honor vanishes and leaves us disgraced in our own esteem and the esteem of othlers. Guard your good name as you giard the apple of your eye, and bear in miind the old saying, 'To make money re- quires perseverance ; to keep it, wisdom; to spend it is an art wlich can only be acquired by culture ;' those who have money and no culture become through their very wealth lowered in usefulness and true nobility. Acquire culture- it is even better than wealth. P3e at home when the neldy call. 'Be at peace with yourself, with your fellow-men, and  &#xD;<pb n="364-365 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC7121-00000183"/> your life will be blessed with G(od's choicest blessings!" and kissing the happy couple, and exclaiming in a grateful tone, "Soli Deo Gloria!" the noble old man retired to his quiet and happy home. And re-echoing, To God belongs the glory, we close this volume in the sweet hope that this book has not been written and read in vain. THE END.   NEW BOOKS AND NEW EDITIONS, RECElNTLY ISSUED BY G W.

She is in many respects without a rival in the world of fiction. Her characters are always life-like, and she makes them talk and act like human beings, subject to the same emotions, swayed by the same passions, and actuated by the same motives which are common among men and women of every day existence. Mrs. Holmes is very happy in portraying domestic life. Old arid young peruse her stories with great delight, for she writes in a style that all can comprehend."- Newr York Weekly. "Mrs. Holmes' stories are all of a domestic character, and their interest, therefore, is not so intense as if they were more highly seasoned with sensational- ism, but it is of a healthy and abiding character. Almost any new book which her publisher might choose to announce from her pen would get an immediate and general reading. The interest in her tales begins at once, and is maintained to tho close. Her sentiments are so sound, her sympathies so warm and ready, and her knowledge of manners, character, and the varied incidents of ordinary life is so thorough, that she vould find it difficult to write -any other than an excellent tale if she were to try it."-Bostot Banner. "Mrs. Holmes it very amusing; has a quick and true sense of humor, a sympathetic tone, a perception of character, and a familiar, attractive style, pleasantly adapted to the comprehension and the taste of that large class of American readers for whom fashionable novels and ideal fantasies have no charm."-Henry T. Tuckerran. 1   The volumes are all handsomely printed and bound in cloth,-sold everywhere, and sent by mail, postage free, on receipt of price [$x;50 each], by G. W.
