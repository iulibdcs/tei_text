               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>IT was night, a stormy, cold, bitter night. The tide on its ebb rushed whirling,
                  hissing and foaming through Hurl Gate. The whole Sound was white with foam. On
                  either shore and along the rock-bound sides of Blackwell's Island, the mad surges
                  lifted their heads and uttered their sullen roar.—It was a night that made even
                  the felon feel as he heard the turmoil without, that his cell was comfortable. And
                  at this dark, stormy hour, within one mile of each other, yet all unknowing of
                  each other's vicinity, were three relatives—each linked by blood, yet oh how
                  different in nature. To their description, as they were at that hour, is this
                  chapter devoted.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>THE FIRST,</head>
                  <p>Was a white-headed man—one whose age could not be less than sixty years. His
                     form was bent, yet if he straightened up, his height was full six feet. He was
                     very thin—his features were sharp—his cheeks sunken—all denoting
                        <emph>misery!</emph> He was dressed, not in the garments of a criminal, but
                     in those of a pauper, or "Police Prisoner." The fact that at such an hour, he
                     was free from the prison-cell, denoted that he was not a criminal, and,
                     moreover, that he held some favored berth on the Island, allowing him unusual
                     liberty. The figure and features of the man, each possessed a certain,
                     indescribable look of faded gentility, which would impress even a common
                     observer with an idea that the old man had seen "better days." While the storm
                     was at its height, this old man was standing on the bank of the Pond, beneath
                     the shadow of the willows. He was gazing moodily down into the water, which
                     ever and anon was lighted up, as the clouds broke away for a moment from
                     beneath the moon, and wild and strange were his mutterings while he gazed.
                     There were his words. "Howl on ye winds—howl on, for hoarse and cold as your
                     tones are, the voices of humanity in the world are more harsh! Three score
                     years have I breathed this tainted, earthly atmosphere—and though I have seen
                     the spring-time of innocence, and the full summer of happiness—yet have I seen
                     a winter so drear, so dark, so terrible, that all memory of joy is frozen from
                     my heart. Is it not better that I die? The loud winds would drown my last
                     moan—the trees wave mournfully down toward the dark waters. Ada, once my pride,
                     is lost to me forever; Annie, she whom I adored, was false and heartless, and
                     my son, a very image of myself, is, by his own confession<pb n="4-5"
                        xml:id="VAC6988-00000003"/> fession to me, a pirate on the Main, if he has
                     not yet perished at the hands of violent men like myself. For what should I
                     live? Ah! Is that a sail dashing down the narrow channel? It is! Why in a storm
                     like this does she thread this passage, dangerous as it is even in the
                     day-time. There's something wrong—there's something wrong!"</p>
                  <p>The old man shook his head as he said this—left the side of the pond and
                     stepped briskly across the shore nearest to the vessel. But already she had
                     disappeared down the bay, bearing on her quarter deck.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <p>THE SECOND RELATIVE.</p>
                  <p>The old man peered down the bay after the vessel for a little time, but he saw
                     no more of her. She had seemed peculiar in her build, rig and in the color of
                     her hull, to him. She was in rig, a two-top-sail schooner, with very long lower
                     masts, and only a square topsail and top-gallant sail above her fore-and-aft
                     sail on each mast. But the small iron wythes at the head of her top-gallant
                     masts, showed that if necessary. "sliding-gunter polls" could be run up, which
                     might bear a royal and even a sky-sail above that. Her main and fore yards were
                     very long, stretching an immense sheet of canvass. Her masts raked to much that
                     if a plumb-line had been dropped from her main top gallant mast-head, it would
                     have swung clear of her taffrail. The hull, which was very long, was low, and
                     painted entirely white. In fact, her rigging, spars and all, seemed to be of
                     the same color, and it was only by the contrast of the dark shore beyond, that
                     the old man had been enabled so distinctly to make out her outlines. But his
                     momentary glimpse and the thoughts which had arisen with it, seemed to have
                     dispelled the darker ideas which had been uppermost in his mind, and singing a
                     quaintish kind of ballad, he walked up along the shore of the Island a few
                     hundred yards, and turning down into the track of an old quarry, soon reached a
                     little hut, which, built close under the side of the hill, looked like one of
                     the Irish "<emph>cabeens</emph>" Lever tells us of. There was no lock on the
                     door, and it was easily pushed in, by the old man.</p>
                  <p>"Who's there?" asked a voice, tainted with a strong Sligo brogue, as the door
                     was touched.</p>
                  <p>"I'ts me, Teague, only me!" said the old man, his voice quivering a little as
                     he spoke, for the wind was chilly from the spray which dashed up on the rocks
                     so near him.</p>
                  <p>"Och, an i'ts glad I am yer come, Captain," said the first speaker. "Sure an'
                     I've been tormented with a drame!"</p>
                  <p>"A dream, Teague! What was it?"</p>
                  <p>"Divil roast me, Captain, if I can remember it at all at all for the fright it
                     gave me—but sure an' I thought ould Gineral Washington was alive agin, and was
                     bating all the houly prastes off o' the counthry, and me wid 'em!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, it was only a dream, Teague;—but how's the hogs?"</p>
                  <p>"The bastes must be doin' well, Captain; for divil a squale have I heard since
                     the blow sat in. Hogs are like human craters, Captain, they love to hear the <choice>
                        <sic>rain rain</sic>
                        <corr>rain</corr>
                     </choice>, and the wind blow, when they're under the sthraw! Och, its
                     considerable I've larned, Captain, since I've had the honor to be your first
                     mate in this responsible office. Sure an' its myself that manes to behave
                     myself, so that the boss'll promote me, arter your time's out. I've three
                     months more'n you, then, och hillaboo! fun, an I'm Cap'n o' the Pig-pen,
                     myself!"</p>
                  <p>"Captain of the Pig-pen!" muttered the old man bitterly. "Yes, to this—I, who
                     once owned thousands, aye, a million of dollars, have descended. First, to be
                     committed as a drunkard to this island, next to consider it a favor to be put
                     in charge of the corporation hogs, because I can avoid the key being turned on
                     me at every sunset. Oh, Annie, you are the cause of this! Ada, where art
                        <emph>thou?</emph> Albert—my God!—deserted, a pauper—and all,
                        <emph>all</emph> this through the inconstancy of woman! I dare not, cannot
                     look back over the past but till <emph>she</emph> erred, I was all that woman
                     could ask of man!"</p>
                  <p>"Is it yer prayers yer sayin', Captain, mutterin' away so low?" asked the
                     Milesian.</p>
                  <p>The old man did not reply, but turned and glanced across the stormy water from
                     the open door. As he did so, he saw a glimmering light on the farther shore—a
                     light which he had often before noticed, and again he murmured his
                     thoughts.</p>
                  <p>"That light," said he, "burns in the old cottage which was once Washington's
                     head quarters. How often I see it, even later than this. Honest folks don't set
                     up that way—there must be something wrong—something wrong!" and again he shook
                     his snowy head.</p>
                  <p>After this he closed the door, and taking a shaving from a pile in one corner
                     of the hut, opened the door of a cracked stove, and lighted a rude tin lamp,
                     thus revealing the inner appearance of the hut. The furniture consisted only of
                     a bench and two bunks, in one of which was <choice>
                        <sic>ensconcced</sic>
                        <corr>ensconced</corr>
                     </choice> the Irishman, whose red face, and redder hair, stuck out from under a
                     dirty blanket, like a beet peering from a dirt-heap. Two "kids," or small
                     wooden tubs, such as are used to convey food for the prisoners, in, were on one
                     end of the bench, and beside one of them lay an old pipe, which was blackened
                     with the "dust of ages," or something else, and had been spliced in the stem by
                     a scientific wrapping of leather and waxed ends. Taking out a plug of tobacco,
                     the old man cut up a small quantity with an old shoe knife, on the bench, and,
                     filling the pipe, lighted it, and commenced smoking. When he commenced, his
                     withered face wore a very sorrowful expression, but as he went on, it lightened
                     up until it looked quite pleasant, wreathed as it was in the light clouds of
                     smoke. The Irishman looked on quietly from his bunk for some minutes, then
                     raising half up, and showing a rawboned, ungainly frame, he cried:</p>
                  <p>"Sure an' it's most time I called for my rint, Captain! The pipe's mine, you
                     know, and one half o' the baccy in it is my price for lendin' you the loan of
                     it!"</p>
                  <p>The old man took three or four whiffs of it, and then, with a sigh, but without
                     speaking, handed it over to his room-mate, or house-mate, if you like the term
                     better. The latter received it with eagerness, and soon sent forth heavy
                     volumes of smoke, showing that he had a better "draught," (as a steam-boat-man
                     would say,) to his chimney than his aged superior in office.</p>
                  <p>The old man looked on a moment, then with a sigh deposited himself on the other
                     bunk, without divesting himself of any clothing. And now for a picture of

                  <p>I have spoken of the light which the old man saw across the water. At the time
                     when the scenes of this story occured, a cottage, which is now torn down, stood
                     nearly opposite the lower end of the Island. This cottage was almost entirely
                     embowered beneath the wide-spread, drooping branches of an immense
                     weeping-willow tree, but there were spaces on the water-side of it that did not
                     prevent its old-fashioned casements from being seen, and through one of these
                     gleamed the light alluded to. This house was regarded with a kind of veneration
                     by the grown-up people in the neighborhood, because it once had been the
                     temporary head-quarters of General Washington; but the children around looked
                     at it with fear, for it was currently reported among them and the nurses and
                     old servants of the neighborhood that it was haunted, and that soldiers could
                     be seen stand-on guard around it every night, after darkness came on. Not a
                     child around could have been hired to go to that house after "twilight shades"
                     had fallen.</p>
                  <p>At the midnight hour when the strange vessel passed—at the same hour when the
                     old man thought dark thoughts beside the pond, on the Island, while the gale
                     bowed the trees down to the face of the water; there were two persons in the
                     most northern of the two rooms, on the ground floor of this building. One was a
                     lady whose silvery hair. neatly laid down on either temple, beneath the ample
                     frill of an old-fashioned cap, as well as a figure bent forward very much, and
                     sunken lips which told that her teeth had left their sockets, denoted an
                        advanced<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6988-00000004"/> age. Her eyes seemed mild
                     and kind, for her spectacles were saddled so low upon her nose, that she looked
                     over instead of through them. A kind smile was resting upon her pale, wrinkled
                     countenance, and wherefore should it not rest there, for was she not gazing
                     upon a lovely picture? That picture was a young female of most radian beauty.
                     Her hair of a light golden hue, curled down on either side from a fair and
                     faultless brow, wreathing a face, the only fault of which was that its features
                     were too regular, too beautifully perfect.—They looked like the work of a
                     sculptor, or like the effect of the artistic skill of some perfect worker of
                     wax models, and had not the warm, rich blood given hue, and the muscular play
                     of the cheeks and cupid-bow lips been seen, you would scarce have deemed her a
                     living, breathing embodiment of beauty. Yet her eyes—large, lustrous orbs of
                     azure, fringed by lashes brown as the hazel, and soft as Italia's finest
                     web—contrasting as they did with her golden hair, told that she not only lived,
                     but was a soulful, passionate, lovely mortal—in short, a very
                        <emph>woman</emph>, though yet in her youth.</p>
                  <p>This young girl, whose age might be seventeen or nineteen years, was bending
                     over a garment which she was making. The light, which has been repeatedly
                     spoken of, was placed before her, on the table, close by the window. The
                     furniture of the room was plain and simple. A large high-post, old-fashioned
                     bedstead stood in one corner—but in the room beyond, a neat little couch with
                     dimity curtains and snow-white counterpane could be seen. But to return to the
                     description of the nightly occupant of that pure-looking little bed. Her
                     figure, though full, was lithe and graceful. Her hand which, with its taper
                     fingers guided the bright needle in its stitches through the dark cloth on
                     which she was sewing, was small, and white as the leaf of the lake-washed lily.
                     Her expression was rather sad, but that soft melancholy seemed to heighten her
                     beauty. Though, I cannot compare her to any of those beautiful creations of
                     immortal minds, which must live forever—though I cannot call her a Helen, or
                     Haidee, or a Dudu, yet I can only say she was originally, perfectly beautiful.
                     In her large eyes, shone an intellect which could not but command respect—her
                     form was almost too statue-like—her red lips, when she smiled, disclosed teeth
                     as white and as regular as pearls strung by a master hand to grace a Queen's
                     coronet.</p>
                  <p>The old lady was looking with a pleased smile upon the lovely girl, but still a
                     look of weariness had settled on her face.</p>
                  <p>"Come, give over, sweet child!" said she—"you need not work so late—it is after
                     the mid hour of night!"</p>
                  <p>"True, dear grand-mother, true," said the fair girl; "but I cannot sleep when
                     it storms so. The walls of the house shake so, I would be terrified, were I in
                     bed, and besides, I am to have my bundle of clothes ready to take down to Mr.
                     Solomon's tomorrow. You know we <emph>need</emph> the money I am to get for
                     them!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah yes, poor child!" sighed the old lady; "Oh, how little did I once expect to
                     see any of my blood forced to labor for their support and mine. Ah me; they say
                     God is good—I suppose he is; but it is hard to be deserted in my old age!"</p>
                  <p>"Deserted, grand-mother! have <emph>I</emph> deserted you?"</p>
                  <p>"No—no; oh, no child, <emph>you</emph> have not! No, God bless you, my sweet
                     child; God bless you!"</p>
                  <p>The old lady fondly kissed the fair girl who bent down by her side and pressed
                     her attenuated hands within her own soft, plump palms.</p>
                  <p>Reader I have painted three pictures for you. There <emph>seems</emph> to be a
                     mystery connected with them. There <emph>is</emph>. By and bye it shall be
                     unravelled.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>THE sun rose bright on the morning after the night of storm; for the clouds had
                  been swept far away toward the west by the impetuous gale. Two men, who by their
                  weather bronzed faces, as well as their garb proclaimed themselves as old sailors,
                  regular "salts," stood on the battery, leaning upon the rude parapet—and gazing
                  upon a vessel at anchor not more than a cable's length from Castle Garden.</p>
               <p>"That's a d—d queerious lookin' craft!" said the elder of the two, whose tarpaulin
                  made of regular "sennit," told that he was a man-o'-war's-man. "I'd like to know
                  where she hails from; what do you think of her, Ben?"</p>
               <p>His companion, a natty young fellow, of six or eight-and-twenty, turned a large
                  quid of tobacco from the larboard to the starboard cheek, hitched up his trousers
                  six or eight inches and replied.</p>
               <p>"She's what they call a yacht, I reckon; looks fast, and if she weren't so white,
                  she'd look devilish?"</p>
               <p>"She looks bitish now," said the other.—But she haint got nothing on deck, not
                  even a gun for a pilot!"</p>
               <p>"But maybe she's got sunthin' down below. She lays low in the water for to be only
                  in ballast trim."</p>
               <p>"That's a fact, d—n my top-lights, if I'd like to run afoul of her at sea, without
                  I knowed all about her aforehand! Look at her, she carries more'n two dozen men;
                  all young hearties, too. There comes a boat's crew—see, they give out the gig
                  stroke, man-o'-war fashion!"</p>
               <p>As the man remarked, a boat was coming shoreward, from the same schooner which, in
                  the midst of the storm, had on the previous night passed through Hurlgate from the
                  Sound. Only one person was in the stern sheets, and he was a pale, blue-eyed man,
                  with a beardless face, but long brown hair, and a form of a little above the
                  medium height, thick-set, but not corpulent. His features denoted him to be of
                  Anglo-Saxon descent, and were not very marked; though a certain firmness of
                  expression in his lips, and a devil-may-care look from his flashing blue eye, told
                  that he was not a man that could be trifled with. While the two sailors watched
                  the boat, it landed, and he who sat in the stern-sheets, sprang ashore.</p>
               <p>"Let nobody go aboard the schooner till I return!" he cried. "Keep a look out for
                  my signal!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, sir!" said the coxswain of the boat, and he shoved off to return to the
                  white schooner.</p>
               <p>The officer, for such he seemed to be; stood for a moment, and gazed with apparent
                  pleasure on his beautiful vessel. That moment served for the sailors to mark his
                  appearance. His dress was very simple.—A frock coat was buttoned close across a
                  full and manly breast,—a loose collar turned back revealed a white but thick neck
                  and throat, and showed shoulders which were broad, though sloping sufficiently for
                  grace. Upon his head he wore a cap of naval blue, which rested lightly over his
                  head of glossy brown hair.</p>
               <p>The only singular sign or token about him, was that he wore upon the front of his
                  cap, a golden serpent, and on the gilt buttons of his coat and cap, the same
                  symbol was seen. His eyes, after resting a moment<pb n="8-9"
                     xml:id="VAC6988-00000005"/> or two upon the vessel, turned and met the glance
                  of the two sailors, which were turned upon him.</p>
               <p>"Well, boys," he cried, "what think ye of my craft?"</p>
               <p>"She's a beauty, your honor!" said the younger. "May I be so bold as to ask where
                  she's bound!"</p>
               <p>"Wherever my fancy and the gale may carry her," said the man, with a smile.—"Don't
                  you want a berth?"</p>
               <p>"We're both out o' berths, your honor," said the elder, "but we'd like to know
                  what kind of a craft we're to sale in, and what's her trade!"</p>
               <p>"Well answered, my man, and right can didly!" said he with the serpent emblem.
                  "Suppose I am a <emph>practical</emph> exponent of the system of free trade and
                  sailor's rights?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what your honor means by <emph>eggsponent,</emph>" replied the older
                  sailor, "but I know what a sailor's rights are?"</p>
               <p>"Well, my hearty, what are they?"</p>
               <p>"Good wages, plenty of grog and tobaccy, and liberty once in a while, to spend in
                  twenty-four hours what he's arnt in twenty-four weeks."</p>
               <p>"Good! capital!" said the officer, with a laugh. "What's your name, and that of
                  your companion?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Jack Parker, all the world over," replied the elder, "but my mate
                  there can give his own name, if he likes. I never meddle with anybody's name but
                  my own."</p>
               <p>"My name," said the younger, "is Ben Hendrickson, and I'm up for any honorable
                  berth; and if your craft is a yacht, as she looks to be, why, you can't do better
                  than to ship Jack and me, that is, if you're short o' hands."</p>
               <p>"I'm not exactly short of hands," said he of the serpent badge, "but to make it
                  easy for my crew, I'm willing to take in six or eight more <emph>good</emph>
                  men—men who know how to haul out a weather-caring in a gale, and can stamp down
                  the bunt of a furling sail, even if it blows great guns!"</p>
               <p>"I can get 'em, your honor," said Ben.</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll take eight, but bark ye, my lad, they must be all native-born
                  Americans!"</p>
               <p>"Does your honor think that I, an old Lancaster county boy, would choose any other
                  sort?" said Ben, reddening up. "Jack here'll tell you better than that; and if he
                  couldn't, his white-rose-bud, at home in old Virginia could. I'm American,
                  Captain, from truck to kelson, all over."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm pleased with your looks. At one o'clock, I will meet you and the men
                  you say you can ship for me. I will meet you over at yonder tap-room, where the
                  old tree bends like a cripple over the door."</p>
               <p>"I'll be there, your honor—but one more word, if you please!"</p>
               <p>"What is it?"</p>
               <p>"Will your cruise be long?"</p>
               <p>"That is uncertain. I may go to Havana, may steer for the far-off Moluccas; I'm
                  fickle and whimsical as a woman."</p>
               <p>"I only wanted to know, your honor, about our laying in hull-wrapping enough."</p>
               <p>"Never mind that, my hearties. I'll see to your dunnage. I always uniform my men
                  myself. Be on the look-out, my lads, at one."</p>
               <p>And, as he said this, the officer passed on.</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Ben, here's a go. What do you think of him? He seems like a goodish sort of
                  a chap!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he's a <emph>sailor</emph>, that you can see; but the devil's in his eye—he
                  looks right through a chap! But I guess he's all right."</p>
               <p>"Yes, or he wouldn't dare to come to an anchorage right under the nose of the
                  Custom House."</p>
               <p>"That's <emph>so!</emph> I didn't think o' that afore; but it sets all straight in
                  my mind. I'm off for the rest. Let's see, who shall we take? There's Tatem, he's
                     <emph>one</emph> of 'em; Daniels is good, but a'most too handsome; Burr will
                  count for one; Dow is a trump; Crane is good, and Gus Trees will make up the
                  mess!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, they'll all pass muster—but can you get Tatem away from the widder?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, for she's got an eye on a strange sail, and Tate couldn't keep his
                  anchorage-ground much longer, anyway!"</p>
               <p>"Well, that's all settled, as the landlady said, when she hove an egg into the
                  coffeepot. Now let's get a boat and take a look around the craft, and see what she
                  looks like. There's Nesbitt's little wherry, the 'Austin,' layin' there ready for
                  a fare!"</p>
               <p>The two men passed to the Battery-place stairs, and stepping into a small,
                  sharp-built scull-boat, rowed out toward the stranger. With admiring eyes, they
                  gazed upon her taut, raking spars, upon her neatly-fitted rigging, which was
                  white, like her hull, as the driven snow. Her running rigging was of white manilla
                  rope—all of her standing rigging, from the futtock shrouds, down to the dead eyes,
                  was covered with canvass and painted. Her hull was very long, and lay low on the
                  water, and its beam was immense. Forward and aft she was sharp as a wedge, and her
                  Haring bows, spreading out above the water, but narrowing below, gave token that
                  she would ride like a duck in a sea-way. Her deck was flush, fore and aft, all her
                  accomodations being below deck. She had nothing warlike on deck, except some
                  eighteen or twenty muscular-looking young men, all of whom were shaved closely and
                  dressed neatly in a uniform garb, the only peculiarity of which was, that on the
                  right arm of each a serpent was embroidered. The cutwater of the vessel was shaped
                  into a similar emblem, the serpent stretching out its head with forked tongue,
                  nearly the whole length of the bowsprit. The stern also bore a carved serpent, in
                  a coil, with its head raised as if about to strike. The vessel bore no name—as she
                  was, so have I described her.</p>
               <p>The seamen rowed all around her, and then after they had pulled away a cable's
                  length or so, Jack spoke:</p>
               <p>"I wonder what that sarpent means?" said he.</p>
               <p>"It must mean her name!" said Ben.—These rich covies have strange fancies. I
                  reckon this 'ere one calls the schooner the Sea Sarpent."</p>
               <p>"Very likely, but there's one thing about her I don't like, and I never can feel
                  right aboard of her, I know. She h'aint got no tar on her rigging, and I h'aint no
                  kind of a man at sea, without I can smell tar, and dip my hand in a bucket once in
                  a while!"</p>
               <p>"Tar <emph>is</emph> nice!" said Ben, and he sighed.</p>
               <p>"Aye, and it's so healthy. They say white lead's pison!" added Jack.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, we'll try her, and if we don't like her we'll go ashore!" said the
                  other, landing the boat, making her fast, and handing over a silver quarter to a
                  fine, hardy-looking boatman, who stood on the bridge.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>IT was between eleven and twelve, on the same day. Closely wrapped in a coarse
                  shawl, with a plain straw bonnet on her head, and her face covered with one of
                  those man-tormentors, (a thick green veil,) a female passed up Chatham street.
                  From beneath the back of her bonnet a profusion of rich, golden curls fell in wavy
                  masses, contrasting with the dark, sombre hues of the shawl, as sunlight falling
                  on a barren hill-side. Beneath the skirts of a black bombazine dress, two small
                  feet glanced out as she stepped rapidly along, and as the wind blew back the
                  drapery, exhibited ancles beautifully formed, cased in a snowy stocking. The grace
                  of her movements left the observer to <emph>imagine</emph> that she must be
                  beautiful—for both form and face were shrouded from view in that odious shawl, and
                  that doubly odious veil. Close behind that female, watching every step, followed
                  the officer whom we lately saw landing from the white vessel. Once or twice he
                  passed, and strove to gain a furtive glance at her features, then, failing, he
                  dropped back.</p>
               <p>She passed up Chatham, till she reached the well-known clothing store of Solomons
                  &amp; Co., and there entering, deposited a bundle which she carried, upon the
                  counter, threw back her veil, and addressed a thin-faced hook-nosed man, who came
                  forward.</p>
               <p>"Here are the clothes, sir, finished, as I promised!"</p>
               <p>"Goot! vill you take more to make?" asked the man.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, if you please, and also the money for these!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, de monish! I wonder vot you girls do with so much moonish as you make; let me
                  see, tree dollar you make this week—here it ish!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Only</emph> three dollars!" said an indignant voice beside the girl,
                     "<emph>only</emph> three dollars for a long week's work!"</p>
               <p>The young girl started, turned round, and beheld the mariner who had followed her.
                  He for one instant gazed in a face of surpassing beauty, then that green veil
                  dropped like a curtain over it, and hid it from his gaze.</p>
               <p>"You want to buy?" asked the Jew.</p>
               <p>"<emph>No,</emph> damnation, no!" cried the young man; "every thread of the
                  garments you sell is steeped with the tears of misery—three dollars a week for one
                  who toils night and day, knowing no pleasure, no rest!'</p>
               <p>The Jew quailed beneath the flashing glance which was fixed upon him—quailed, and
                  turned away toward the door, as if he sought relief from the expected entrance of
                  some new and less scrupulous customer.</p>
               <p>The strange mariner turned to where the young girl had stood a moment before, but
                  she had disappeared.</p>
               <p>"Where is she gone?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"You frightened her, I dink!" said the Jew with a malicious grin.</p>
               <p>The sailor made no reply, but hurried to the door, and glancing up the street,
                  walked rapidly away.</p>
               <p>After he had gone, the young girl, who had stepped behind a screen, returned to
                  the counter and received a bundle of unmade clothing, which was cut out ready for
                  the needle. The Jew did not give her this very graciously—he had been offended by
                  the remark of the mariner, and now coward-like, wanted to vent his spleen on the
                  poor girl.</p>
               <p>"I dink I shall not gif you as mooch, dis time. If peoples are not dankful for vot
                  dey get, den dey need not get it, dat ish all!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, you should not be angry with me. I am very well satisfied. I have never
                  complained!" said the poor girl, trembling lest she should be turned away without
                  work.</p>
               <p>"No, dat ish so; but den your sweetheart, he dat—"</p>
               <p>"Sir," said the young girl, blushing to the temples, "I never saw that young man
                  before. I have no sweetheart, not a male acquaintance!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, den it ish your own fault, my tear! You are <emph>very</emph> pretty!" and
                  the Jew leered lasciviously upon her.</p>
               <p>"Good morning sir!" said the girl, taking up the bundle, and leaving the
                  store.</p>
               <p>When the officer, or whatever he who wore the serpent-badge, was, had gone to the
                  door to see where the young girl had gone to, he thought he saw a dress similar to
                  that she wore, some way up the street, and he instantly hurried after her. But the
                  female who wore it seemed also in a hurry, and it was not until she had walked
                  several squares that he overtook her whom he supposed to be the sewing girl. As he
                  reached her side he passed slightly <choice>
                     <sic>ahead ahead</sic>
                     <corr>ahead</corr>
                  </choice> and glanced toward her face; but there it was again, that green veil,
                  hiding the features of the lady. But sailor-like, he was frank and bold enough, to
                  endeavor to make the girl's acquaintance. Therefore, raising his cap, and bowing,
                  he said:—</p>
               <p>"One word, if you please, fair lady; I must apologise for frightening you from the
                  store of that Jew!"</p>
               <p>The lady stopped, and drew up her figure haughtily, as if offended.</p>
               <p>"Pray, do not be angry with me!" continued the officer.</p>
               <p>"Sah! Dis imperence is quivocally ungemplary!" said a deep, hoarse voice from
                  beneath the veil, which, being thrown back by the gloved hand of the lady,
                  revealed to full view the ebony features of a daughter of Africa.</p>
               <p>The sailor started back in surprise.</p>
               <p>"It is not her, it's only a niggar!" he muttered bitterly.</p>
               <p>"A <emph>niggah</emph>, sah? I let you know I'm not a niggah, but 'spectable
                  colored young lady, and I'm engaged to be married to Ceasaw Adolphus Reddick,
                  Esquire, and if he only catches you arter this, he'll cane you, sah!"</p>
               <p>The mariner lost the last part of the "young colored lady's" reply, for he turned
                  on his heel and retraced his steps. But he had only gone about a square, when he
                  met the real object of his search, who, however, the moment she saw his eyes fixed
                  upon her, dropped the veil over her truly lovely countenance.</p>
               <p>The young man saw in this a desire to avoid his advances, and bold though he was,
                  lawless though he might have been, he felt that he dared not address her.</p>
               <p>"I will at least see where she goes!" he muttered to himself. "She is an angel!
                  Never, though I've trodden every soil, never have I seen one more beautiful!"</p>
               <p>Allowing her to pass, the young man turned afterward, and keeping her in view,
                  followed her. She seemed to be aware that he was tracing her steps, for her pace
                  became more rapid, and two or three times she turned the corners of short streets,
                  and left that which she had started in, although she soon returned to it. The
                  rapid walk soon took them down the boat which passing up the East River to
                  Astoria, makes a landing near the house described in the first chapter, as having
                  once been Washington's Head Quarters, where the aged grandmother sat and gazed
                  upon the lovely face of the '<hi rend="i"/>third relative.' The lady passed into
                  this boat, and seated herself in the back of the ladies' cabin. The sailor
                  followed, and seated himself at some distance, and in view of her. He could see
                  that she aware of his presence, for she seemed restless and uneasy.</p>
               <p>As the boat was on the point of starting, he took his watch from his pocket,
                  glanced at the hour, and as one of the boat-hands<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC6988-00000007"/> passed, asked him how long it would be before she
                  returned.</p>
               <p>"Two hours, sir," said the man respectfully.</p>
               <p>"It is now eleven," said the officer impatiently, "and I am to be engaged at
                  twelve and one. Look here, my good fellow, can you do me a service?"</p>
               <p>"Maybe I can, and maybe I can't," said the man, with the peculiar and honest
                  bluntness of a New York boatman.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the officer, "come forward with me a moment—I wish to speak to
                  you."</p>
               <p>The man did so, and they stood forward of the engine-room a moment after.</p>
               <p>"Do you see this golden eagle?" asked the officer.</p>
               <p>"I don't see anything else!" said the man.</p>
               <p>"Do you want to earn it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if I can honestly."</p>
               <p>"You can. There is a girl, now sealed in the afterpart of the boat—a green veil
                  over her face—straw bonnet on—coarse woolen shawls black gaiters on the prettiest
                  feet you ever saw!—"</p>
               <p>"Well, what o' her? I know the gal you mean, and—"</p>
               <p>"Know her?"</p>
               <p>"That is, I know her when I see her, for she <emph>is</emph> handsome; comes down
                  once a week with work for some store or other; but I never spoke to her!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, well! then you know where she lives?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Tell me and this eagle shall be your's!"</p>
               <p>"What d'ye want to know for?"</p>
               <p>"The question is impertinent. I want to know and that is enough!"</p>
               <p>"No it isn't though! Look here Mr. Officer, or whoever you are, I'm only a common
                  sent of a man; haint got much education, nor can't afford to wear fine
                  clothes.—But d—m me if I haint got as big a heart. and as good a heart, and as
                  strong an arm as any other <emph>he</emph> livin'; and if you mean that gal any
                  harm, blow me to thunder if I don't Jam you till you're blind!"</p>
               <p>"But my dear fellow I—I—"</p>
               <p>"Feller be d—d; I'm none o' your <emph>fellers!</emph> I'm a man and an American
                  working man. My heart aint hard, but my hand is, so take warning!"</p>
               <p>"Then you'll not tell me where she lives?"</p>
               <p>"No; I'll see you hung first!"</p>
               <p>"Then I shall stay aboard the boat and follow her home!"</p>
               <p>"No you don't!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I will not?</emph> Is not this boat a public conveyance, and cannot a man
                  go where he pleases, you insolent rascal?"</p>
               <p>"Look here, mister; I'm a peace man—I never get very mad, and I'm only mate aboard
                  o' this boat, but you've said just enough? You'll go ashore!"</p>
               <p>The young man smiled, and put his hand to his breast but before he had passed it
                  within his coat, he found himself raised as if in the arms of a giant, and east
                  clear of the boat's side, upon the wharf. At the same instant the last bell rung,
                  the boat was started, and the officer livid with rage, stood upon the wharf,
                  without any chance for satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"This shall cost you a <emph>life</emph>!" said he bitterly, as he shook his
                  clenched hand at the mate, who stood by the gang way of the steamer, regarding him
                  with a quiet and contented smile.</p>
               <p>The mate only returned the threat and gesture, by making a sign familiar to many
                  of the B'hoys, as expressing the words—"<emph>no you don't!</emph>" and made by
                  placing the extremity of the thumb, upon the point of the nasal promontory, and
                  performing girations with the fingers in the air. The officer spoke no more; but
                  with lowering brow and downcast eyes, hurried up the wharf. An instant after, to
                  use a sailor's phrase, he was "bro't up all standing," by finding himself face to
                  face with a man and woman, both of whom he had nearly knocked down by the
                  contact.</p>
               <p>"What you mean by dis, sah!" shouted the man—a stout black fellow; "what you mean
                  sah! See, you spile Miss Priscilla's bonnet, wid your imperence!"</p>
               <p>"Oh Cesaw Dolphus, it's him!" shrieked the female.</p>
               <p>"Who dat—who dat you mean?" asked the Ethiopian.</p>
               <p>"De man that presult me little while ago! dat's him!"</p>
               <p>"Den I'll have a personal satisfaction, sah—dere is my card sah—I see you again
                  sah, dam!"</p>
               <p>The only answer the sailor gave, was a heavy kick upon the darkie's shin bone,
                  which left him limping and yelling with pain while the sailor walked on.</p>
               <p>"I must see that girl again!" he muttered as he went on. "I know not why—but I
                  feel as if there was a fate which yet will link her and me. I love her, loved at
                  first sight. She must, aye, and shall be mine! I will go to the Jew; for money
                     <emph>he</emph> will betray her residence, at any rate; and if he does not, all
                  I shall have to do is to watch his store and the boat. Yet, perhaps I may have
                  orders to go to sea. I must see old Whitelead at twelve! But first to the Jew's,
                  to see what I can make out of him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>"WELL, what do you want? I'm busy; can't you see I am!"</p>
               <p>"I want money, Pa, and money I must have!"</p>
               <p>The one who asked the question, was a man whose age was probably fifty. His face
                  was pale and as cold looking as marble—his eyes small and grey—his hair thin and
                  scattered—his features coarse and repulsive, yet bearing a cast which showed that
                  he was an educated man, and not unused to good society. His dress was rich but
                  plain. He sat before a table covered with law-books, in a Library room or study,
                  which was literally lined with book-shelves.</p>
               <p>The person he addressed. was a dark haired girl. or woman, of twenty-five or six
                  years of age. Her figure was tall and graceful—though rather slender. Her features
                  were fine; of a Grecian cast—her eyes a very dark blue; her color high, as if in
                  fact, art had aided nature in its hue. A haughty expression seemed peculiar and
                  natural to her—a look as if heart and soul, and feeling could all be sacrificed
                  when demanded for a selfish motive, or when passion dictated such a sacrifice. A
                  look, which indicated that no love could exist in her heart, which was not either
                  cold and calculating, or raised by a mere animal admiration of a showy figure, or
                  an air <foreign xml:lang="FRA">distingue,</foreign> which would make the love
                  valuable in a mere worldly view. Her dress was excessively rich. yet not without
                  taste, in both quality and arrangement. Though there was a strong contrast between
                  the two—there was both in feature and bearing sufficient similarity to indicate
                  the relationship between them. In answer to her, the gentleman said:</p>
               <p>"I gave you five hundred dollars yesterday, Mary—you use a great deal of
                  money!"</p>
               <p>"Have I not a right to do so?" she asked. "You are rich, I am your only child; you
                  should rejoice to spend your wealth upon me!"</p>
               <p>"I do, Mary; I do—but this extravagance—"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, sir, extravagance, when one day's income is over two thousand dollars in
                  your pocket, and that too, over and above certain <emph>speculations,</emph> which
                  to say the least, are not countenanced by any laws—human or divine!"</p>
               <p>If it were possible for his <choice>
                     <sic>palid</sic>
                     <corr>pallid</corr>
                  </choice> face to become more white, than did his countenance turn pale as he
                  heard this remark, uttered in a tone of coldness, approaching to a taunt.</p>
               <p>"Tut tut, child, don't talk that way; you shall have the money; but what do you
                  want it for?"</p>
               <p>Had the lady intended to reply (which she did not) she would have been prevented
                  by the appearance of a servant, who bowing very low as he said:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Whitelead—Captain Boldart is coming up, and orders me to announce him!'</p>
               <p>"Ah, Boldart; is the Sea Snake in? She must be!" said the old gentleman. "Tell him
                  I wait with impatience to see him!"</p>
               <p>"And to know how much blood stained gold he has made on the trip for you!"
                  muttered the daughter bitterly.</p>
               <p>A look of mingled anger and fear, and entreaty passed over the old man's face, but
                  subsided, and changed into a smile, as our hero of the serpent badge entered the
                  room.</p>
               <p>He doffed his cap as he came in and bowing to the old man cried:</p>
               <p>"Your obedient humble servant, Mr. Whitelead!"</p>
               <p>Then observing the lady he bowed still more low, colored slightly, but said
                  nothing.</p>
               <p>"So, my fine boy, you're back safe and sound, and the Sea Snake is all right, eh?"
                  said the old man, as he took the hand of the young Captain.</p>
               <p>"She is—her cargo small but valuable—ballasted, as usual with only her armament,
                  and silver dollars!"</p>
               <p>"Where have you left her—up the Sound, in the creek!"</p>
               <p>"No, sir! She's at anchor off the Battery!"</p>
               <p>"The old man sprang from his chair as if he had been shot.</p>
               <p>"Is the boy mad!" he cried. "Why, do you know the risk you run—the Custom House
                  officers will be abroad, and you'll lose vessel, and life too, if they discover
                  what—"</p>
               <p>"They can't find out! They've been aboard already, and have found the wine of the
                  owner of the English yacht, Cobra di Capello, to be very fine—the vessel to be a
                  beauty, and her papers to be all right!"</p>
               <p>"You speak in riddles, pray explain sir!"</p>
               <p>"I will, Mr. Whitelead. There was a fine yacht, bound from Cowes, for Havana,
                  which a certain fine American schooner fell in with, off Bermuda, about four weeks
                  ago. The captain of the American schooner, went aboard of this English yacht,
                  simply on a visit of <emph>courtesy,</emph> you know. He was struck with the name
                  of the English yacht, which was the 'Cobra di Capello,' which is Italian for a
                  peculiarly dangerous species of serpent—and as his own yacht was named the Sea
                  Snake, the coincidence seemed singular.—Was it not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, but go on! What next?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you see, both vessels were hove too some forty or fifty miles from land, and
                  the sea was very smooth, and the air calm as your fair daughter's lovely brow—I
                  beg your pardon, lady, for the <choice>
                     <sic>comparrison</sic>
                     <corr>comparison</corr>
                  </choice>, but I always think of the ocean when I look on beauty—</p>
               <p>"Never mind flattering the girl, she is vain enough already—go on with your
                  story!" said the old man impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, to make the yarn short, I went aboard of the English yacht and had a
                  pleasant spree with Lord Platimere, its owner. After he drank a little wine, he
                  got patriotic, sang a song about Nelson, and swore England was the Queen of the
                  seas. I got ditto, sung that glorious old stave about the Constitution taking the
                  Guerriere so neat and handy, oh, and told my Lord, I could whip him and all his
                  crew, one by one, solitary and alone. Then he got <emph>bullish</emph>—hit me a
                  tap on the region of the bread room, and I was under the necessity of exhibiting
                  to him a specimen of Yankee ingenuity, in the shape of a revolver. He had only
                  time to examine one barrel, when he rolled over and <emph>went to sleep</emph>.
                  Two, three, four more of his cabin passengers had their curiosity satisfied in a
                  similar manner, and my boat's crew on deck, hearing how I was engaged below,
                  imitated my laudable endeavors on deck, and in less time than I have told it—they
                  were all asleep!"</p>
               <p>"Dead—dead you mean! I thought I had particularly requested you to spare life—we
                  have a place to put all of our prisoners, you know, a safe one too!"</p>
               <p>"None safer than where I sent those d—d Englishmen—lady, I beg your pardon for the
                  expression, but I love the English as Satan loves holy water!"</p>
               <p>"So you killed them all! What did you do with their vessel!"</p>
               <p>"After borrowing all the money and plate. and securing everything
                  valuable—especially her papers, I had a gun fired through her bottom. In half an
                  hour she and everything aboard, which I had seen carefully secured had gone down
                  to Davy Jones' locker!"</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6988-00000009"/>
               <p>"So you got money and plate, eh! How much?" and the old man's grey eyes twinkled,
                  as he asked.</p>
               <p>'A good haul, twenty or thirty thousand, at any rate, But that's not all—I found
                  letters aboard, which induced me to make bon voyage. This young Englishman, it
                  appeared, was on his way to Havana with letters of introduction, and also with a
                  proposition from his father to a certain Conde de Mario, in regard to marrying his
                  daughter. an heiress, and a beauty! So, being myself a judge of beauty (the
                  captain here bowed lower than ever to the daughter of the old man). I thought I
                  would go and deliver the letters and see the lady, which I did!"</p>
               <p>"Well—well, go on!" said the old man, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Please</emph> go on, most heroic Captain Boldart!" said the lady, with a
                  look which might have been enterprised in two ways.</p>
               <p>"Well, fair lady. I visited her, and found her all my fancy painted her, as the
                  poet says. I presented my letters, made love to her, and the old Count's
                  coffers—and here I am!"</p>
               <p>"Where is the lady—did you <emph>marry</emph> her?"</p>
               <p>"Why, not exactly—that is not according to all the rules of the Holy Mother
                  Church!"</p>
               <p>"Then you ran off with her?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly that, either!"</p>
               <p>"Be so kind then as to say what you did do!"</p>
               <p>"Well, fair lady, since you desire to know, I will tell you. We were engaged and
                  everything was in readiness for the marriage ceremony. The old Don had got out all
                  his show of wealth—had told me how rich he was, and the evening had arrived when I
                  was to have the honor of becoming the lady's lord and master. But singular as it
                  was, some bold rascals, with marked on, rushed into the house, tied and gagged the
                  old Don and all his friends and servants, took everything from his house worth
                  taking, except the Senorita; and having overpowered me, carried me off in sight of
                  the whole party, tied like a pig in a cart. The Senorita fainted; so did I, and
                  didn't recover till I found myself aboard of my own vessel, bound out thro' the
                  Moro passage. And as my vessel lay down considerably deep in the water, I had to
                  examine to account for it, and, singular as it was, found that the villains who
                  had robbed my intended father-in-law, had actually put all of the property on
                  board of my vessel. Well, I was afraid if I returned it he would, with the world's
                  usual charity, accuse me of having stolen it, or else insult my dignity with an
                  offer of a reward for having recovered it; so I thought I'd sail for New York,
                  which I did, and here I am!"</p>
               <p>"But will not our vessel be suspected and followed? Your sailing so suddenly would
                  engender suspicion."</p>
               <p>"I took care of that. In the first place, the yacht Sea Snake went into Havana,
                  rigged like an English cutter—in the next place, the black covers were on the
                  rigging and the black and red coat on her hull. In twenty hours afterwards, she
                  looked as she does now!"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, you've done nobly, all but the bloodshed!" said the old man.</p>
               <p>"And nobly in that!" said the lady, bitterly. "For my part, I wish the English
                  nation had but one neck, and it lay upon a block, and I had a headsman's axe in my
                  hand, <emph>I'd cut it off!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The young captain looked at the lady as she said this, and could she have
                  interpreted that look, she would have learned that he, lawless as he was, detested
                  the unwomanly, cruel heartlessness she manifested.</p>
               <p>"But the money, the money—we must get that ashore!" said the old man.</p>
               <p>"That shall be done this evening!" said the Captain.</p>
               <p>"And you will sail soon again, eh?"</p>
               <p>"Whenever you order, but I am in no hurry—a week or two of rest will not hurt me
                  or my crew. Besides, as I have done so well on this cruise, I'd like to play the
                  gentleman, the man of fortune, here for a week or two. There is a yacht club which
                  will doubtless do me all the honors of the profession.' There are the Stefans, the
                  Knedgars, the Flourers, the Birclays. &amp;c.—they'll be sure to call on my
                  lordship, and invite my lordship to dinner at the Club House, and extend other
                  civilities."</p>
               <p>"Good, good! And you'll do that? Oh, how I wish I was a <emph>man!</emph>" said
                  the lady. "Can't you dress me up as a page, or a waiter, Captain?"</p>
               <p>"Mary, Mary! could you forget the modesty or dignity of a woman so!" cried the
                  other, angrily.</p>
               <p>"I would dress you always like a queen!" said the Captain, with a gallant bow.
                  "But now, Mr. Whitelead, and you, fair lady, must excuse me. I have an engagement
                  at <emph>one</emph>—it lacks but a few minutes of the hour; I will be here this
                  evening, and with me will come the transfer from the vessel to your strong
                  box."</p>
               <p>"You will pass the evening with us, will you not?" said the lady, with a winning
                  smile on her beautiful face. "Do, Captain, I wish to ask you many questions!"</p>
               <p>"Your wishes are my commands, lady. For the present, adieu!"</p>
               <p>"Now, father," cried the lady, after the sailor had left, "you can afford to give
                  me—not the paltry five hundred I asked for, but a <emph>thousand!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Girl, girl, you drive me mad with your extravagance. I'll give you five hundred.
                  no more!"</p>
               <p>"Then, sir, I'll go down to the Battery, get a boat, go on board this vessel and
                  help myself, and let them oppose me if they dare. I'd soon let folks know what was
                  going on."</p>
               <p>The old man groaned, but drew his pocket-book from his breast and handed her the
                  money she asked for. She received it, then bending over him, she kissed him
                  tenderly, as if nothing ever had ruffled his temper, or she had used one word
                  harsher than those she now spoke.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my dear <emph>good</emph> father!" said the lady.</p>
               <p>The old man bent his head down over the table—when he raised it she was gone.</p>

               <p>WHEN the steamboat passed on up the East River, the rough mate who had pitched
                  Boldart ashore, stood and gazed at him until he was lost among the people who were
                  passing to and fro about the wharf.</p>
               <p>"There's mischief in that ere chap!" said he to himself. "He means harm to that
                  poor gal; but, by the oyster that couldn't be swallowed alive, I'll stand betwixt
                  her and him! I've got sisters, I have, and once I had a mother. I'll go and see
                  the gal, and put her on her guard."</p>
               <p>"I mean no offence, ma'am, but you know who I am!"</p>
               <p>"I have often seen you on the boat, sir, as I have gone to the city and came
                  back."</p>
               <p>"Yes'm, I've been on the old boat a long time; but that's neither here nor
                  there.—Did you see a young, officer-looking chap staring at you a bit ago?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, he followed me all the way from the store."</p>
               <p>"Well, he won't follow you any more. ma'am, this trip, at any rate. I just now
                  hove him ashore, 'cause from what he said I know'd he meant you harm!"</p>
               <p>"Meant harm to me who never wronged him, or any one!"</p>
               <p>"Yes'm, Lord bless your innocent soul, that's just it; it's such like innocent,
                  pretty girls as you are that them ere he sarpents always go arter. What d'ye think
                  he wanted me to do?"</p>
               <p>"I know not; please tell me, that I may be on my guard!"</p>
               <p>"He wanted me to tell where you lived. I asked him what for; he got mad and cursed
                  me, and I pitched him onto the dock—I wish I had broke his neck!"</p>
               <p>"And all this you did for me!—you are very kind!"</p>
               <p>"No ma'am; it was only my duty, cause you see I've got sisters driftin' about in
                  the world, and if I do my duty, why, when any chap comes foolin' around to do them
                  hurt, God Almighty will pay me for this act, by putting some rough chap like me
                  betwixt them and danger—that's my way of thinkin'. Every act in this world get's
                  its reward, be it good or bad."</p>
               <p>"So my dear grandmother often tells me," said the fair creature, who, having
                  thrown back her veil, now turned her innocent and beautiful face toward the
                  warm-hearted mate.</p>
               <p>"I've a favor to ask, ma'am," he continued. "I wish you wouldn't go to the city no
                  more alone. You're too handsome to walk in the street, with nobody to take care of
                  you."</p>
               <p>"But, sir, that cannot be. I have no friends but my grandmother, and she is too
                  old to walk."</p>
               <p>"Haint you got no brother!"</p>
               <p>"I had one, once, but it was a long time ago!"</p>
               <p>"Is he dead?"</p>
               <p>"I fear he is; he never came back from sea."</p>
               <p>"He was a sailor, then, God bless him!" said the mate, drawing his sleeve across
                  his eyes. "I say, ma'am, don't think me bold, I mean no offence, but I wish you'd
                  look on me as a brother, when I can do anything for you. I can go to the store for
                  you—I can do anything. I'm poor and work hard for a livin', but by the big oyster,
                  there arn't nary man livin' that can say I cheated him, nor a gal neither. But
                  don't you go to the city no more, alone, please; that 'ere chap is dangerous, and
                  he's got a bad eye, but I'll spoil it for him the next time he runs afoul of
                  me!—now forgive me, Miss, there's the bell tolling for the landing, I must go
                  for'ard. But please first tell me your name!"</p>
               <p>"Ada Morland, sir. And yours?"</p>
               <p>"Mine is Dick Isherwood, 1st Sergeant of the Governeur Blues, the Independents,
                  and one of the Island boys, at that. Good bye, ma'am, till next time; I must go
                  and make fast; remember, I'm to be a kind o' brother to you when you need
                  help."</p>
               <p>The girl's blue eyes were glittering like violets in the dew as he turned away.
                  Two grateful tears, essence of her pure soul, had climbed up into her large eyes,
                  and rested there like diamonds on enamel.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>After Mary Whitelead, the daughter of the pale-faced man who, from his
                  conversation with the young Captain, we are left to believe was the owner of the
                  "White Cruiser," had left her father's room, she hurried to her own chamber and
                  soon completed a promenade toilet. This done, and provided also with the
                  everlasting green veil, so convenient for disguise, she passed into the street,
                  and, though a carriage was at her command, hurried away on foot.—Square after
                  square did she hurriedly measure with noiseless and queenly tread, (for her walk
                  was magnificent,) until at last she stood before a small three-story brick
                  building in a cross street not far from the Park. One moment she glanced up and
                  down the street, as if to see if she was watched, then taking a pass-key from her
                  pocket, opened the door and entered. Who inhabited that house, and what her
                  reasons were for entering it, or why she carried a key which at any hour would
                  admit her into a strange building, is more than the reader can learn in this
                  chapter. Yet though this is a tale of Mysteries, each one shall be unfolded, and
                  all be made clear as the light of day, and a moral shall be found which will go
                  cold and sharp as a dagger of ice to the hearts of the vicious, and cheeringly
                  reach the souls of the suffering.</p>
               <p>And to close this chapter, I will tell the reader who Mr. James Whitelead is! He
                  is a New Yorker by birth, but his grandfather was a British Spy and tory, and his
                  father's principles were of the same cast, though he had cunning enough to avoid
                  showing them openly to the public eye. There had never been much wealth in the
                  family, and when James arrived at the age of twenty-one, he found himself prepared
                  for the bar, well educated, but penniless. Any one who knows what New York is,
                  knows that <choice>
                     <sic>a a</sic>
                     <corr>a</corr>
                  </choice> young and unknown lawyer, has about as much chance of advancement at the
                  New York bar, for his first six, eight or ten years, as a Wall street broker has
                  of getting to Heaven and that is no chance at all. And so it was with young
                  Whitelead. His first year, though not brief, was <emph>briefless</emph> to him! He
                  owed his board, washing, and even his boot-black, and was forced to visit
                     "<emph>uncle</emph>" Simpson's more than once with a law book under his arm,
                  which he did not bring away. About the first week in the second year of his
                  practice, however, he got a case. It wasn't a very important case—merely the
                  defence of a fellow for hog stealing—but the thief had no hopes that he could be
                  saved, or he would have employed a better lawyer. But the keen eye of young
                  Whitelead discovered a flaw in the indictment—quashed the trial—cleared his
                  client. The latter was grateful, but he had no money.</p>
               <p>An hour after the trial was over, he was seated with his lawyer in the attic,
                  occupied as a "study" and chamber by the latter.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you wot it is, Mister Whitelead," he said, "I'm sorry I haint got none
                  of the queer to pay you for your trouble, but you shan't be neglected for all
                  that. I'm goin' to make a lift to-night, sure's my name is Doby Snaps! I'll give
                  you half I make out o' the squealers, if you'll help me <choice>
                     <sic>to to</sic>
                     <corr>to</corr>
                  </choice> sell 'em."</p>
               <p>"Help you to sell them? What do you mean?"</p>
               <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6988-00000011"/>
               <p>"Why, them 'ere squealers will be up at Bull's Head a little arter sun-rise, and
                  there'll be men as wants to buy 'em, but they'll may-be think I haint got no right
                  to 'em, there's so <emph>many</emph> o' these bloody hog thieves round, they spile
                  the bizness! Well, if I can perduce the country gentleman I buyed 'em of, it's all
                  right, isn't it? Yes! Well, you've got to be that country gentleman, and you kin
                  share about fifteen dollars, if I lift a full load!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Fifteen dollars!</emph>" said the young lawyer, with a sigh. It had been
                  some time since his pocket had been responsible for so large a sum. "Fifteen
                  dollars!" he repeated; "but then the risk! Hog stealing, by a member of the New
                  York Bar! Horrible!"</p>
               <p>"Poh, that aren't no meaner than stealin' from widders and orphans, and poor
                  devils of <emph>human</emph> creeters, the little all they've got!"</p>
               <p>"So it isn't!" said Whitelead, "so it isn't—I'll join you, hit or miss, I must
                  starve if I don't!"</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>And he did!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>From that night the tide of fortune turned flood for Mr. Whitelead, and he went on
                  and prospered in all kinds of rascality, until at the date of our story he was up
                  well into the <emph>millions</emph>, though still passing as only a moderately
                  wealthy man. But I must explain no farther at present, or the reader may get too
                  early a hint of our mysteries, which ere we are through, will make more than one
                  guilty heart in this city quake with terror.</p>
               <p>We will now return to the daughter.</p>
               <p>Miss Whitelead, as I said before, entered the house with a pass-key, exhibiting
                  thus a familiarity with the dwelling, which requires explanation. At the moment
                  when she opened the lower door, there were two persons in the front parlor of the
                  second story. One was a tall man, who requires a full description at our hands,
                  for he is one of a class who exists in New York, and members of which can always
                  be met on Broadway when the sun shines—a set who will best be recognized by my
                  lady readers, when I say that they are addicted to staring into ladies's faces,
                  following handsome ones, who are not protected by a gentleman, and speaking to
                  them in the street—in short, well dressed, well curled and bearded libertines,
                  whose only pursuit is that of pleasure and passion. Some of these are gamblers,
                  others are men of means; others, and by far the larger class, are supported by
                  women of the town, who take a fancy to them, and furnish them with money to clothe
                  themselves and procure their living! No meaner or more <choice>
                     <sic>contemptiple</sic>
                     <corr>contemptible</corr>
                  </choice> way of living, for a being professing to be a <emph>man</emph>, could be
                  imagined, yet at least one half of the well-dressed fops in Broadway,
                     <emph>do</emph> live by such means! Think of this, women of America, when you
                  meet these moustached apes, and <emph>scorn</emph> them, as they deserve!</p>
               <p>The person first alluded to was tall, of good figure, had a jet black eye, a heavy
                  moustache and beard, and being dressed in a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">robe de
                     chambre</foreign>, or dressing gown, while the other was in a walking dress,
                  was apparently the regular tenant of the room in which they were seated. The other
                  person was younger than the first, probably twenty-five or six years of age. He
                  was dressed in the height of fashion—a standing collar of snowy linen, was
                  supported by a lilac cravat which was stiffened, so that his neck looked uneasy—in
                  fact, as if it were clasped in the stocks, or pressed by the iron collar of the
                  garote. He had an apology for a cane in his hand—a small straw of rose-wood, with
                  an emerald of large size and brilliancy set in the head of it, which he frequently
                  looked at, as if <emph>he</emph> thought it showy, if no one else did. A white
                  vest, faultless boots, white kids on his hands, and a "Jennings" frock coat served
                  to set off his exterior neatly and well. His face wore already the ravaging marks
                  of early dissipation—a moustache was stuck on his upper lip, <emph>or
                     perhaps</emph> it grew there. The first, I will introduce to you as Mr. Charles
                  Jafferens—the other as Henry Vandersplyken, a descendant of one of our old
                  Knickerbocker families, who is rapidly breaking up the little remains of a once
                  large property, earned by the industry, and saved by the thrift of his phlegmatic
                  ancestors. These persons were seated in a parlor which was very handsomly
                  furnished, each with a cigar in his mouth, conversing.</p>
               <p>"Harry," said the elder, "I wish you'd lend me your 'turn out' this
                  afternoon—those bays of yours and the light wagon; I want to drive out to
                  Burnham's!"</p>
               <p>"You can have them Charley; but why the duce can't I go along?"</p>
               <p>"Why, the fact <emph>is</emph>, my dear fellow, there's a pretty little dress
                  maker that lives under the <emph>saintly</emph> charge of a couple of <choice>
                     <sic>avericious</sic>
                     <corr>avaricious</corr>
                  </choice> old maids, who keep a dress-making establishment up-town, and I've
                  promised to meet her a few blocks from their house, and take her up there for an
                  afternoon's ride. I met her at a ball—is my reason good?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, capital! You shall have the team. I never stand in the way of sport, you
                  know, but—"</p>
               <p>A quick, decided knock at the door, caused both of the gentlemen to start to their
                  feet. The elder did not speak, but quickly pointed to the open door of the
                  bed-room which adjoined the parlor, motioning to the other to enter it, which he
                  quickly did, closing the door.</p>
               <p>The next instant, as the first said "come in!" the door opened, and Miss Mary
                  Whitelead entered.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my lovely angel!" cried the gentleman, casting away his cigar, "how happy I
                  am to see you! This is an unexpected pleasure, therefore it is doubly sweet!"</p>
               <p>"A truce to flattery, Charles!" said the lady. "I received your note, stating that
                  you would need a sum of money to-morrow; I thought I would bring it at once!"</p>
               <p>"Angelic Mary, you are indeed kind! It is true that I am pressed for
                  money—expected remittances from my uncle have failed to reach me, and this
                     <emph>loan</emph> will indeed be a favor!"</p>
               <p>"Here are the five hundred dollars," continued the lady, "say no more. As you are
                  alone I will sit down. I am glad you wanted a favor—it gives me another
                  opportunity to prove my affection for you; yes, to show you that I, who am called
                  heartless by others, and who <emph>hate</emph> the generality of men, and despise
                  nine-tenths of them, have for you an affection as boundless as thought, and as
                  warm and wildly burning as the lava of quenchless Vesuvius!"</p>
               <p>"I am proud and happy, dear Mary, to have won so priceless an affection!" returned
                  the gentleman, "and I am willing and should feel blessed, if you would allow me to
                  bestow my hand where I have given my heart!"</p>
               <p>A singular smile passed across the countenance of the lady—a look which expressed
                  more than words could.</p>
               <p>"You would like to be my lord and master, eh, Charles?"</p>
               <p>"No; your <emph>husband</emph>, dear lady!"</p>
               <p>"My husband! The master of my hand and my <emph>legal</emph> owner and
                  superior—the <emph>legal</emph> owner of a woman whose fortune is immense,
                  and—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mary, you do not think I want your fortune? That insinuation is
                     <emph>cruel!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Charles; we will not argue that point. But in regard to <emph>marriage</emph>,
                  you ought not to wish it if I do not. I met and <emph>loved</emph> you—gave you
                  what the world would call <emph>honor</emph>—became in all forms but the
                     <emph>legal</emph> and manmade ceremony, your wife. And yet, loving you as
                  fondly as ever, I hold my freedom. If you grow cold, I can leave you; should my
                  passion cease to exist, I am free to seek another, or to pass on through life
                  alone. Marriage, to a heart so wild and impulsive, so proud and so self-willed as
                  mine, is a mockery! I would not bind myself for life to the best man in the world.
                  Freedom for me—freedom to love whom, when and where I please! Women when married,
                  are but slaves to their husbands—that is, two-thirds of them are!"</p>
               <p>"Mary, what a strange woman you are!"</p>
               <p>"Maybe I am; yet I'll warrant there is many an one like me, or who
                     <emph>thinks</emph> as I do, even though she dares not express her
                  feelings!"</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6988-00000012"/>
               <p>"What does your father say about your not marrying?"</p>
               <p>"He does not wish me to. To have a third sharer in our fortune would kill him. For
                  money, alone would he have me marry; money is his first, last and constant
                  thought. He has no other passion; never but once had he any other!"</p>
               <p>"And that once?"</p>
               <p>"Was a wild, mad love for a lady—a love which brought ruin on her and her's, so
                  far as I can learn, though I cannot find out all about it. It was a strange
                  affair; he has a written account of it, which I once by accident got hold of; but
                  he saw me reading it, before I got into the heart of the matter, and took it from
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"Where is the lady? Is she living still?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; but why do you ask? You seem <emph>interested!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, not at all; it was mere curiosity!"</p>
               <p>The gentleman stammered and seemed confused as he said this—a fact which argued
                  that more than mere curiosity prompted the question. The lady did not appear to
                  notice this, but with a smile said:</p>
               <p>"I regret then that I cannot better satisfy your curiosity. But, Charles, you seem
                  cold and reserved to-day; you have not offered me the simple tribute of a
                  kiss!"</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, dear Mary! I am not well," he replied; "but take this kiss, and
                  believe me it comes from lips which can never tire of that duty, or of saying how
                  much I love you!"</p>
               <p>She returned the kiss with a passionate fondness which betokened how ardent was
                  her nature when once it was aroused. But the gentleman did not renew his caress,
                  and seemed uneasy—a matter easily accounted for, when we remember the close
                  vicinity of his late companion. The lady noticed this, and again murmured:</p>
               <p>"You seem constrained to-day, Charles. I know not when you have treated me so
                  coldly!"</p>
               <p>"Dear Mary, I am not cold. But I feel really ill. I have had a head ache all the
                  morning!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you need rest. Had you not better lay down? I will bathe your head with
                  cologne and watch by your side till you sleep; and then I will go home."</p>
               <p>"No, dear Mary, no!" said he, fearing that she would go to the bed-room where his
                  friend was hidden; "no, I think a walk in the fresh air will do me good. I will go
                  out with you!"</p>
               <p>"I would rather you would not, dear Charles. I begin to fear to walk in the street
                  with you so much, for fear that our intimacy be suspected. I am in my own soul
                  careless of the opinion of others, yet I have a position to sustain. I will go out
                  now—should you extend your walk so far as Thompson's, you might possibly meet me
                  there and renew this conversation. Those large Broadway saloons are very
                  convenient for us lovers. Many a one meets there!"</p>
               <p>"Well love, I will meet you there in twenty minutes!"</p>
               <p>"Till then, dear Charles adieu!"</p>
               <p>Again lips met lips in loves' sweet communion, and then stately and graceful as a
                  ship under full sail upon the ocean, the lady passed away.</p>
               <p>As soon as she was gone, the younger man came out from the bed-room.</p>
               <p>"By Jupiter, Charley, you've something queenly on a string. Who is she my dear
                  fellow, who is she?"</p>
               <p>"That would be telling, Harry; that would be telling, and one musn't tell tales
                  out of school, as the school-master told the biggest girl in the first class, when
                  he kept her in for "punishment," and the punishment consisted of kissing, and a
                  practical lecture upon the art of love!"</p>
               <p>"I don't understand this last idea, Charley; you are too much for me!"</p>
               <p>"Am I? Then I'll explain! I received the first rudiments of my education in the
                  little village of Danville, Pennsylvania, and went to a school kept by a Mr.
                  Mortimer Case, and a <emph>hard case</emph> he was! I didn't like him over much,
                  because he once intercepted a letter, written by my me to an angel, whom I loved
                  then; my first love; and one who never <emph>yet</emph> has been banished from my
                  heart.—But that isn't my story. There was a girl at our school named Cass Smith;
                  Cass was a nick-name for Catherine. Cass was the oldest girl in the school; pretty
                  but stupid; and Mr. Case was very attentive in helping her to learn her lessons.
                  But tho' he was very kind to her, he would frequently punish her for being
                  imperfect; and his punishment always consisted in keeping her in. Well, one day,
                  we boys having suspicions to satisfy, climbed to a window in the rear of the
                  school house, and saw that the punishment of Miss Cass consisted in being kissed
                  by the master. We didn't wonder after that, why Cass didn't learn her lessons. But
                  boy-like we told what we had seen; and the consequence was that a big brother of
                  hers gave the school master a tremendous flogging; and the next week, Cass ran
                  away with the poor fellow and got married to him. But, Harry, excuse me—I must
                  hurry and dress. As you seem to have listened to what my lady-love was saying—you
                  heard me engage to meet her!"</p>
               <p>"Yes Charley; but you haven't forgotten the ride you are to take?"</p>
               <p>"No, Harry—and I want you to get your turn out and take me up in Broadway. I'll
                  leave you up at the New York Hotel!"</p>

               <p>OPPOSITE the Battery, or rather directly in front of the Battery is a small liquor
                  shop, or groggery, where liquor of various qualities has been retailed since the
                  boyhood of "The oldest inhabitant." Before the door stands a crooked and gnarled
                  tree, which looks as if it has grown up in a bad humor from a very twig. The inner
                  part of the old-fashioned crib is not very enticing—but it is odd—entirely unlike
                  any of our modern bar-rooms. The front part is a bar attached with liquors for all
                  classes—three penny-gin—or six penny brandy—as called for. The back part, is a
                  smoking-room, built up with small tables, at which those who wish to drink
                  leisurely, can seat themselves.</p>
               <p>It was one o'clock. In the back part of this establishment, were the two sailors,
                  whom we met in the early part of the story, and who had engaged to meet the
                  captain of the Cruiser—and with them were six others; each of whom, by his dress,
                  showed that he followed the sea for a living. They were young, hardy looking
                  men—whose open, independent looks proclaimed them to be <emph>American!</emph> It
                  is a fact, though it may seem <emph>singular,</emph> that wherever you meet a son
                  of Liberty's soil—you can at a glance recognize him to be an American. There is an
                  honest, fearlessness in his face—something of the eagle in his eye—an uprightness
                  of form and carriage, which, at once identifies him as a <emph>free
                  man</emph>.</p>
               <p>The men were all standing in a group—evidently waiting for the coming of him who
                  had made the appointment.</p>
               <p>"It's most time that ere skipper hove in sight, ain't it Ben?" asked one of
                  them.</p>
               <p>"I should think it was—it is the hour I promised boys!" said the person alluded
                  to; who had approached them unobserved.</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> his honor!" cried Ben. "Well sir, here are the men I spoke
                  about—they are all yankee-born, and I'll stand security for they're knowing their
                  duty. Here isn't a man of 'em that hasn't doubled the Horn, or who don't know
                  every rope from the royal mast down to the deck!"</p>
               <p>"Well my lads,—have you seen my craft?"</p>
               <p>"Yes your honor—but we have'nt been aboard. If we may be so bold as to axe your
                  honor—what is she called and where does she hail from?"</p>
               <p>"Well, as you're going to ship in her for better or worse, you've a right to know.
                  I call her the Cobra-di-Capello; but my lads aboard call her the Sea Snake!"</p>
               <p>"There!" said Ben—"that's what I told Jack Parker, her name would be!"</p>
               <p>"Where does she hail from, sir?" asked Jack, touching his tarpaulin at the same
                  time.</p>
               <p>"Well my lads—I'll tell you that in good time. She's all right—only a little
                  smuggling business she has been in, makes it necessary for me to keep dark about
                  her. At present, remember that I am to be known as Lord Platimere, owner of an
                  English Yacht!"</p>
               <p>"Lord Platymer, why your honor is not a <emph>Britisher?</emph> If you are, we'd
                  rather not ship!"</p>
               <p>"No, I am <emph>not</emph> one—was born under the stars and stripes; but as I told
                  you before—it is necessary for me to sail under false colors for a while.
                  Besides—I wish to have some fun with the big nobs in the Yacht Club—and shall pass
                  as an English Lord for a while, till I go to sea!"</p>
               <p>"How soon may that be, your honor?"</p>
               <p>"A week—maybe a little more—perhaps a little less. But soon the prow of my bonny
                  sea-boat shall kiss blue water. Say, boys, do you go in her?"</p>
               <p>"Well, your honor," replied Ben, who seemed to be the elected spokesmen of the
                  party. "I don't see as we can have any objection, provided the wages is
                  sufficient. If you're 'free trade' in course there's some risk; for if a cutter
                  overhauls us, we'll have to fight, for such boys as we, don't surrender."</p>
               <p>"True, my lads. Your pay shall be $20 a month, and the usual share in all prize
                  transactions!"</p>
               <p>"All right, your honor, we'll go aboard. Me and Jack will answer for all that
                  comes with us!"</p>
               <p>"Well, boys, all's right. There's a half eagle, drink it out and come aboard!"</p>
               <p>Saying this, Captain Boldart threw down a five dollar gold piece on the table, and
                  left the men to their enjoyment. He passed hurriedly across the Battery and made a
                  signal to his vessel. A boat was immediately sent and he was rowed aboard. Reader,
                  we will follow him and see what is to be seen.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>WHEN the Captain of the White Cruiser stepped on board his vessel, each man of the
                  crew touched his hat, evincing by this act alone that the commander enforced
                  respect, and kept his crew in strict discipline. He returned the salute, and
                  passing aft descended into the cabin.</p>
               <p>One who viewed the vessel from the shore, would have scarcely imagined that there
                  would be room below to slow so large a crew as she carried, and their provisions
                  for a month—she lay so low on the water.—But when aboard, her immense beam and
                  depth of hold which many a square-rigged vessel does not possess, betokened her to
                  be far more roomy than she looked.</p>
               <p>The cabin into which the captain first enforced was a room about fourteen feet
                  wide, by twenty in length; furnished with extreme magnificence: The deck was
                  carpeted with heavy stuff from Damascus looms; a rosewood sideboard was in the
                  forward part loaded with plate. Over-head, a fresco painting representing a
                  beautiful southern sky, was seen; a thin ceiling having been placed under the
                  usual deck timbers to conceal them. Around the room gorgeous paintings were
                  pannelled in, and gold and carved work appeared profusely but tastefully arranged
                  between them.</p>
               <p>The paintings were of Eastern scenes, and in all of them the faces and forms of
                  beautiful women were prominent features. On either side of the side-board forward,
                  was a door, which led to the forepart of the vessel. In the centre of this cabin
                  was an elegant table of the kind which can be extended or close up, as desired. In
                  the after part of the cabin, a single room opened to an apartment, or apartments
                  still further aft. Over this door, in gilded letters, was placed these words,
                  "Private—Captain's Sanctum."</p>
               <p>When the Captain entered the outer cabin, a young man was seated at the table,
                  busily engaged in drawing. He was a slim, pale faced youth, not more than twenty,
                  to judge from his appearance. His dress was very <choice>
                     <sic>similiar</sic>
                     <corr>similar</corr>
                  </choice> to that of the commander. He too wore the badge of the "<hi rend="i"
                  />Serpent." He started to his feet when the Captain came in, and with a glad smile
                  cried:</p>
               <p>"I'm so happy you're back again, Captain, it's infernally lonesome here! I walked
                  the deck for hours in impatience, and thought you was never going to come!"</p>
               <p>"I've been detained, and had quite an adventure, good Rudolph; but what are you
                  drawing here, my boy? As I live—a picture of our Island home; and your Eveline
                  standing before it! Ah, boy—you needn't blush so; you draw well!"</p>
               <p>"You spoke of an adventure, Captain, was it anything unpleasant?"</p>
               <p>"No—that is, not exactly so, though its result was far from satisfactory!"</p>
               <p>"Tell me of it. You know I love to hear of adventures!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, boy, and to share in them when there is love or danger connected with
                  them!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Captain, it may be so. I love to share in yours, for you are brave, and
                  when you love, you love with taste. No common beauty fires your soul!"</p>
               <p>"That is true boy, and yet, to day, in the form and face of a poor sewing girl, I
                  found that which has left my heart raging like Vesuvius during an eruption!"</p>
               <p>"What, a common sewing girl, Captain?"</p>
               <p>"No—an <emph>uncommon</emph> one, Rudolph; eyes large, gloomy and yet brilliant as
                  great dew drops in the cup of a violet. Hair hanging in golden glossy curls, wavy
                  and bright as sun-light on the ocean, when a gentle breeze rolls up short waves. A
                  form of such grace that even through a coarse shawl its outlines were delineated.
                  A foot, fit for a sculptor's model—a step light as the gazelles, pliant and
                  bounding as a bird upon a quivering bough!"</p>
               <p>"And she a sewing girl?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—Rudolph, and working for <emph>three dollars</emph> a week!"</p>
               <p>"Well, did you tell her you could do better for her?"</p>
               <p>"No, I had no chance!"</p>
               <p>"And you did not even tell her that you loved her?"</p>
               <p>"Only with my eyes, and that seemed to frighten her!"</p>
               <p>"You are going to see her again, are you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, most certainly I am, if I can find out where she lives!"</p>
               <p>"What—you do not know that?"</p>
               <p>"No—when I was following her I had words with a man on the steamboat which goes
                  from a ferry—and Rudolph, to my shame be it said, the strong wretch cast me ashore
                  as if I were a mere toy in his hands!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>And does he yet live?</emph>" cried Rudolph, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"He does, and will till I once more meet him, and that shall not be long
                  hence!"</p>
               <p>"Where is he, my Captain, tell me and let me go and punish him!"</p>
               <p>"No, boy, I can avenge an insult with my own hands—but I may want to use this
                  fellow to find out where she lives, for find her I will, and when next we plough
                  blue water she will be the queen of my sanctum in there. It is some time since I
                  have had company in there! Where is Geronimo!"</p>
               <p>"He is in there, I expect, Captain. The child has been crying half the day—he
                  frets about our Island Home and his mother?"</p>
               <p>"Poor little devil, I pity him; but it will not be long before we sail for there.
                  I want some rest, and Whitelead will be all the easier when he knows I'm off at
                  sea. By the way, you must get his share of the money ashore to-night. Ah, what
                  have we here, letters?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Captain; they were brought aboard awhile ago, by a boat's crew from that
                  beautiful sloop yacht, which lays across the river. I have been looking at her
                  with the glass half the morning. She is a beautiful craft!"</p>
               <p>A smile gathered upon the face of the Captain, as he read the first note which he
                  opened. After perusing it, he said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Rudolph, here is a pleasant chance for some fun. Mr. Stefans an others, ask
                  to be informed when they can have the honor of calling upon my lordship! How the
                  devil did they find out my lordship?"</p>
               <p>"You bade me enter the yacht's name at the Custom House, did you not?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, boy."</p>
               <p>"I did so, with your lordship's name and rank. Of course the news that an English
                     <emph>lord</emph> is here, will spread like wildfire in this
                     <emph>republican</emph> city! But that other note, so delicately sealed and
                  perfumed, what does it say, mon Captain!"</p>
               <p>Opening it, the Captain read:</p>
               <p>"The compliments of Mrs. Fitzjames Klawke, and begs Lord Platimere to let her know
                  when he will be disengaged for an evening, that she may have the distinguished
                  honor and inexpressible felicity of welcoming him to New York, in the company of a
                  few friends, at her residence, No. — Bond Street."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! Favors begin to shower in now. If this poor sewing girl that I have
                  fallen in love with, was the daughter of an uppertendom snob, I would easily win
                  her as my lord Platimere.' Great republic, this—great city, when its fashion and
                  aristocracy will run mad about foreign apes and fools, and neglect the talented
                  and high-minded sons of their own soil. Well, Rudolph, reply to these notes. Say
                  to the Yacht men they can come aboard in the morning at eleven—say to the lady I
                  will be at her service on the evening after tomorrow."</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6988-00000015"/>
               <p>"I will sir." said the other, drawing writing materials from a locker in the side
                  of the cabin.</p>
               <p>The Captain entered the after cabin, and what a beautiful room it was! A faint,
                  mellow light stole in through plates of heavy stained glass set in the stern of
                  the vessel, and in the deck overhead; and, if more light was needed, a golden
                  lamp, with several jewelled lustres, was suspended overhead. This cabin was
                  literally filled with mirrors, on three sides; but in the stern part of the vessel
                  was a large painting representing a group of lovely islets, their trees and
                  flowering shrubbery's, teeming with the luscious beauty of the South. The islands
                  seemed to be inhabited, canoes or boats were painted upon the water. Everything
                  looked beautiful and life like. On either side of this cabin, which was smaller
                  than the other, a door opened into a stateroom, which was furnished with a
                  voluptuous richness which would have satisfied even a Persian prince in the day's
                  of Persia's glory. Overhead the fresco painting was also adopted—but here it was
                  made to represent the ocean in a fearful storm.—Clouds of ebon blackness, except
                  where they were cloven by the red lightening's bolt, were seen, and pitchy,
                  foam-capped waves picturing the ocean in its might of wrath. On a broken spar
                  clung a poor young sailor, his long hair streaming in the gale—no sail in sight,
                  no friend near to cheer or save. A strange, a wild, yet a grandly beautiful
                  picture. Around the room ottomans of crimson velvet, trimmed with gold, were
                  placed. The carpet was of silk, its woven figures representing female forms,
                  draped as were the graces of old.</p>
               <p>When the Captain entered the room, which, in all its furniture, was so unique and
                  yet so magnificent, he called the name of "GERONIMO!"</p>
               <p>A small boy, dressed in a half-Turkish, half-Italian costume, sprang from an
                  ottoman where he had been laying asleep, and came forward. His large dark eye,
                  brunette complexion, aquiline features, and thin little form, all denoted his
                  Italian birth.</p>
               <p>"Master, I am here!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my young boy, yes; but your eyes are red—have you been weeping?"</p>
               <p>"Not much, my kind master; but I was thinking of my mother, who is far away at our
                  happy Island home. I know she weeps often for me, for when you are gone, dear
                  master, and I am away, she is lonely!"</p>
               <p>"Well, child, we will soon sail—be cheerful. It is ungrateful to me to be un
                  happy!"</p>
               <p>"So it is, my kind master. You saved me and my mother from death. She loves you,
                  and I love you. I will try to be happy."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do</emph>, child! You are lonely here. Soon I will have a fair lady here
                  for you to attend upon, and—"</p>
               <p>"A lady!" said the young page quickly; "a lady—and will you take her home to our
                  beautiful Island?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"It will <emph>kill</emph> my mother!" muttered the boy. "She <emph>loves</emph>
                  you—no one else must!"</p>
               <p>"Poh, child; you did not say that when you saw me kneeling at the feet of that
                  lovely Spanish lady in Havana!"</p>
               <p>"No, my master, because you did not love or want <emph>her</emph>; you only sought
                  for money there. But now you will take a lady on board to <emph>love</emph>—you
                  will carry her into the presence of my mother, who loves you? Oh do not that my
                  master, my mother is an Italian, and it will <emph>kill</emph> her!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, child! you know her not. Woman forgets easily. We have been away a long
                  time!"</p>
               <p>"Those that have our blood in their veins, never forget!" said the boy, drawing
                  himself up proudly. "Nor love, nor hate, nor kindness, nor wrong, does our race
                  forget!"</p>
               <p>The Captain smiled, and returned to the outer cabin, where he heard his name
                  called.</p>

               <p>IN a far off sea, near where the spicy Molluccas raise their green and flowery
                  heads above the coral beds, our next scene is laid. A group of small islands,
                  exist in a part of the Indian ocean out of the track of trading vessels, and so
                  surrounded for many leagues by coral reefs, that no one but an experienced pilot
                  could ever approach them through the sinuous <choice>
                     <sic>chanels</sic>
                     <corr>channels</corr>
                  </choice> that led to a sung harbor inside of the circle which they formed. There
                  were seven of these little islands, six were low and level, covered with a rich
                  growth of wood and shrubbery, and formed a complete circle around the seventh
                  which was a lofty, rocky Island, with but little vegetation visible upon it. But
                  the hand of man had turned its barrenness into use for the protection of the
                  others. A fort was built upon its summit, which, with a battery, covered the
                  entire circle of islands, showing dark muzzled cannon bearing upon every channel
                  of approach. A tower steepled high above the centre of this fort, upon which, when
                  needed, a beacon could be lighted, or a flag hoisted. The fort occupied the entire
                  peak of the island. Down near the water where a few scattered shade trees were
                  seen, some large bamboo cottages were standing, and around them people were moving
                  and children were playing. Canoes of light and pretty model were seen to pass to
                  and fro from the other islands, and those who came to the cottages brought fruit
                  and flowers. Strange, though it was, they who thus lived in a far southern clime,
                  where the natives are all of a dusky hue, they who dwelt upon these islands were
                  as fair as our own sons and daughters of the north. In costume they combined the
                  European with the Asiatic style—that is the grown persons. The little children,
                  which tumbled around among the flowers, or gambolled on the pebbly shore, wore the
                  costume of nature—<emph>no more</emph>.</p>
               <p>Into the largest of these bamboo cottages the reader will accompany me. It was
                  furnished in the usual European (or American if you please) manner. Chairs,
                  tables, a sofa, piano, side board &amp;c., were there, and were it not for the
                  yellow jointed bomboo walls you might have fancied yourself in the cottage of some
                  of our retired New York merchants, who sport a suburban cottage as well as an
                  up-town brick and mortar palace.</p>
               <p>There were but two rooms in the cottage, the first finished as I have just
                  described, was tenantless when we glanced at it. But stepping through the half
                  closed door of the next room you behold a room still European in its furniture,
                  but as gorgeous as a poet's dream. There you do not see the rough joints of the
                  yellow bamboo, for from the roof down, all the walls are hung with folds of
                  velvet, the colors red, white and blue.</p>
               <p>These overhead, are drawn to a centre like the apex of a tent, and an eagle of
                  gold clutches the centre folds. On one side stands a bed; its posts high, like
                  ours in olden times, and at the head and foot on separate frames stand two immense
                  mirrors. The floor is carpeted with a fine carpet of shiny hair cloth, which in so
                  hot a climate feels as deliciously cool to the feet as would a floor of marble.
                  There were no chairs here, but luxurious ottomans and sofas were placed
                  conveniently around. A centre table of mosaic work, was partially<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6988-00000016"/> covered with books and on it stood a vase of fresh
                  culled flowers which cast a delightful perfume around the room. This apartment was
                  not tenantless. A female, one whose age <emph>might</emph> be thirty, but who did
                  not look to be over twenty-five, was seated, or rather half reclined on an ottoman
                  near a window which opened a view toward the sea. Her complexion was dark but
                  brilliant as is ever the case with the olive-hued brunette. Her features were as
                  classic, as if some Grecian sculptor had formed each one. Above a clear high brow,
                  a mass of hair, dark and glossy as a raven's wing, was arranged like a coronet,
                  while from it fell a waving cluster of jetty ringlets. Her dress was exceedingly
                  simple. It contrasted in color with her hair and complexion, so as to add doubly
                  to her beauty. It was a simple robe of white muslin, so thin that the outline of
                  every limb could be discovered—every limb so perfect, and so full of grace. Her
                  small white feet were slipped into a slender shoe, and no stocking hid the veins
                  of azure and pink which swelled across the beautiful instep. But in her eyes lay
                  the soul of her beauty. Seldom falls it to the lot of the artist to try to paint
                  such eyes, or of the author to describe them.—They were large—very large, and so
                  intensely dark that no pupil could be seen.—They looked like orbs of liquid dew,
                  spread upon, whether it was in love or in anger, she needed not to open her lips
                  to say what she meant Never were eyes more expressive than hers. Shaded too by
                  long drooping lashes, as they were, when their gaze was over a jewel of jet, and
                  whatever her glance fell cast down no one could tell what was passing within. Her
                  form was rather above the middle height and though not plump was as graceful as
                  man can imagine.</p>
               <p>"Who was she, and what was she doing here?" asks the reader. I will tell you what
                  she had been. She had been the daughter of a noble Italian, and the wife of mother
                  Italian nobleman, to whom, at a very early age she gave a son, a boy bright and
                  beautiful as herself. This nobleman, in a voyage to Brazil, in a vessel of his
                  own, had been captured and killed, as were nearly all of his crew, by a gang of
                  pirates, who soon afterwards attempted the capture of the "White Cruiser,"
                  commanded by our hero of the serpent badge; but they sought what they could'nt
                  get, and got what they didn't expect, a tremendous beating. They hauled down their
                  colors when two-thirds of their crew were slain, and their vessel was sinking.
                  Boldart boarded her, found this lady, her child, and a maid servant—rescued and
                  took them off to his vessel. He left the pirates to sink with their disabled
                  ship.</p>
               <p>He had, sometime before, in his distant voyages, found the Island we have
                  described threaded and surveyed the channels to them, and had planted a provision
                  depot there, that it might serve him as a rendezvous. Thither he steered now, and
                  on the long voyage he succeeded by kinds acts and gentle courtesies in winning the
                  young widow away from her grief, and in replacing her lost husband in her heart by
                  himself. In a little while she loved him with all that wild, passionate, zealous
                  devotion, which it peculiar to Italian character. He had built this cottage for
                  her, and whenever his vessel came in from a cruise, he was to her, all that her
                  husband had been. As her boy grew older he took the child to sea as a kind of pet
                  page. We have seen him in "Geronimo." His mother's name was "SADA."</p>
               <p>When we glanced first at the lady as she reclined upon the ottoman, her manner was
                  quiet and dreamy. Her half closed eyes were turned toward the distant ocean, her
                  voluptuous bosom rose and fell with gentle heavings—limbs she moved not. But new
                  thoughts seemed to come in her mind a moment after. Her bosom's heavings grew
                  quicker, her pinken nostrils distended, the long lashes of her eyes were raised,
                  and while more brilliantly shone the orbs beneath—the color rose in a burning gush
                  of beauty to her cheeks.</p>
               <p>Rising to her feet she passed to the window, and as she gazed out upon the <choice>
                     <sic>beauful</sic>
                     <corr>beautiful</corr>
                  </choice> view, she murmured:</p>
               <p>"Oh, that <emph>he</emph> would return! I so long to place my burning kisses on
                  his manly lips, and to press my child, my sweet Geronimo, to my throbbing heart.
                  Would that I had the snowy wings of yonder gull which skims the sea so swift and
                  light, I'd fly to find him and never let my pinions rest until he was found and I
                  had nestled down to rest upon his fond bosom!"</p>
               <p>To and fro—to and fro, for many minutes now she paced the room. Little did she
                  dream, that then, at that very hour, he whom she loved was pursuing with
                  unhallowed love, the sunny haired ADA the poor sewing girl of New York.</p>

                  </choice> summer evening that ended day in which all of our city scenes, so far,
                  have occurred, a very old man, dressed in coarse and uncomely garments, went on
                  board of the same ferry boat from which Captain Boldart had been so
                  unceremoniously cast ashore in the morning. His hair was white as the driven snow;
                  a pair of those protecting goggles sometimes used by the blind were over his eyes;
                  and he carried a long staff in his hand, with which he felt the way before him as
                  he walked on. A young boy held him by the hand, leading him on kindly and
                  tenderly. How beautiful it is to see the young thus lending their fresh faculties
                  to the infirm who have lost these. The boy, too, was dressed poorly, but his
                  garments were whole and clean. They looked like grandsire and grandson. They sat
                  down in the cabin on board, and soon after, the boat started. Shortly after she
                  left, the Captain of the boat came around collecting his fare from the passengers.
                  When he went to where the old man and the young boy were seated, he glanced at the
                  latter, and making a motion of his hand toward the old man, said:</p>
               <p>"Blind. eh?"</p>
               <p>The boy nodded an affirmative.</p>
               <p>"And poor?" continued the Captain.</p>
               <p>Again the boy nodded.</p>
               <p>"No charge!" said the Captain passing on.</p>
               <p>"God's blessing on yon!" murmured the blind man. The Captain did not appear to
                  hear him, but a self-satisfied smile rested upon his face as he passed on
                  attending to duties. He had done, as he supposed, a good deed. Alter he had
                  collected all the fares, he came back again and stood before the blind man. He
                  drew a quarter from out his handful of change, and handing it to the boy said:</p>
               <p>"There lad, is a trifle; but it may help you a little. I'm not rich, or I'd do
                  more!"</p>
               <p>"We don't want money, sir—we've not far to go!" said the old man in a tremulous
                  tone.</p>
               <p>"Not far, eh! How far?"</p>
               <p>"Somewhere near Ravenswood, I believe. I've a dear young grand-daughter, I don't
                  know exactly where she lives. At the store that she sews for, they told me it was
                  near Ravenswood!"</p>
               <p>"A sewing girl, eh?" asked the Captain. "A beautiful, golden-haired creature?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, she has hair like my daughter had afore she died, poor thing!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I know her then. She lives a'most a mile below where we land—down at the
                  cottage they call Washington's Head Quarters! Everybody can tell where
                     <emph>that</emph> is!"</p>
               <p>"Thank you kindly, sir; God bless you; thank you kindly!" said the old man, his
                  voice trembling very much, though a higher color came in his white cheek.</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>It was an hour later. Ada, our beautiful Ada, was seated beside the sewing-table,
                  in the little front room of the cottage. Her aged grandmother was reading aloud
                  from that wisest, most precious of all books, the holy Bible. Her selection was
                  the 49th psalm, one of the most beautiful of all that collection of sacred
                  poetry—beautiful, because it consoles the poor, and gives them a moral lesson
                  which cannot but make them contented with their lot. With her fair fingers gers
                  rapidly plying her needle, Ada sat listening to the words of inspiration as they
                  fell from those aged lips, gathering, I ween, pleasure from the thought that in
                  Heaven worldly wealth is unknown, and purity and goodness only is paramount.</p>
               <p>The old lady had just read the last verse, laid down the book, and taken off her
                  spectacles, which she wiped with her dark silk handkerchief, when a timid rap was
                  heard at the door.</p>
               <p>"Lud ha' mercy on us! Who can come here at this time o'night—its e'ena'most nine
                  o'clock!" said the old lady.</p>
               <p>"I'll go and see, grandmother!" said Ada. laying down her work.</p>
               <p>"Don't unbolt the door, child, it might be robbers—don't, now!" said the old lady,
                  trembling in every limb.</p>
               <p>"Fie—dear grandmother! How often you have told me that God protects the innocent!
                  Besides, nobody would come to rob us, for everybody knows we are poor! Poor folks
                  can sleep in peace, when rich ones dare not!"</p>
               <p>While she spoke the brave young girl was drawing back the heavy bolts of the old
                  fashioned door. When she opened it, the same old man and boy whom we have seen on
                  board the steamboat stood before it.</p>
               <p>"A crust of bread and a cup of water, for the mercy of Heaven!" said the old man.
                  "We have journeyed far without food, and are almost famished!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, grandmother!" cried Ada, with feeling. "see, it is a poor old blind man and a
                  little boy leading him. Come in, sir, come in. They want food, grandmother; the
                  Bible teaches us to feed the hungry!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, child; bid them in."</p>
               <p>As Ada led that old man to the big arm chair from which her grandmother had
                  arisen, she felt the hand she held shake and quiver like an aspen leaf when the
                  evening breeze kisses the flowers. She thought that age and weakness caused that
                  tremor. Had she known that it was passion, and that she held then the
                  blood-stained hand of a lawless <emph>pirate</emph> in hers, how terrible would
                  have been the change in her emotions.</p>
               <p>After seating the old man and boy, and while the grandmother talked to and asked
                  questions of both, Ada hurried to set out for them a frugal supper. Little did she
                  think that through those green goggles two flashing eyes, full of passionate fire,
                  were marking her every movements, gazing upon each graceful outline of a form
                  which in the thin dress of the sitting-room was revealed, and not hidden as it had
                  been in the street by the uncomely coarse woolen shawl. Her dress, which, though
                  neat, was evidently old—for she had ont-grown it in height—was so short that it
                  revealed a beautiful foot, eased in a tiny slipper which she had worked with her
                  own hands, an ancle above it which was faultless, and swelling proportions still
                  above it, which would have left a sculptor a study for a model. Her arms, round,
                  white as if carved from alabaster, were bare to the elbow. Her dress was made low
                  in the neck, as if for comfort, for it is hard to sit at work with one's neck
                  choked up and yoked up with a whale-boned stiffened "<hi rend="i"/>garote." This
                  revealed her faultless shoulders—her neck of inimitable grace. Oh! how beautiful,
                  how angelical she looked while performing those gentle duties of kindness and
                  charity! She soon had prepared the table, which she drew up before the old man,
                  and pouring out for him a cup of tea which she had sweetened herself, and laying
                  bread upon his plate upon she had spread butter with her own hands, she bade him
                  and the young boy eat.</p>
               <p>The old man's hand trembled with apparent avidity as he seized the morsel and ate
                  it.</p>
               <p>"Don't you say grace before you eat?" murmured the old lady in holy surprise.</p>
               <p>"Don't hurt his feelings, grandmother!" said Ada, in a low tone. "Think how hungry
                  he must have been!"</p>
               <p>The old man bowed his head upon his hands. He had never learned that lesson
                  before, and it came upon him with strange force. He kept his head bowed upon his
                  hands for several minutes; they thought he was in silent prayer, but they were
                  mistaken. He was only trying to still a raging volcano in his breast.</p>

               <p>"It is always good to thank God for all we get!" murmured the old lady, and then
                  she put her spectacles on again and opened her Bible once more. The old man now
                  ate freely, but the boy, whose eyes seemed to gaze with wonder and sorrowful
                  expression on the face of Ada, ate scarcely a mouthful. When Ada urged him, he
                  only murmured:</p>
               <p>"You are <emph>so</emph> good, lady. But I'm not hungry—I can't eat!"</p>
               <p>Whenever those dark green goggles were turned toward the boy, however, a tremor
                  would pass through his frame.</p>
               <p>Soon the repast was finished.</p>
               <p>"Now let us go, grandfather!" said the boy; we can soon reach Williamsburgh, now
                  you are strengthened—you know our <emph>relations</emph> live there!"</p>
               <p>"God forbid that I should drive the old and blind from under my roof in the dark
                  night!" said the old lady; "you are welcome to abide till morning. I will yield
                  this room to you and your sweet boy, and share my dear Ada's cot in the inner
                  room!"</p>
               <p>Again the frame of the old man shook as with an ague. "I dare not stay," he
                  muttered to himself—"the temptation would be too great. I know now the
                  localities—have seen how to effect my entrance—can take her the night I am ready
                  for sea, and no one but myself be the wiser."</p>
               <p>"What did he say?" asked the old lady, who could not understand his low murmuring
                  as he communed with his own dark spirit.</p>
               <p>"I will go—I am refreshed. God will bless you good folks for your kindness to
                  wanderer!" said the old man.</p>
               <p>"Nay, do not go forth—it is dark and cold; stay until the morning, and then you
                  will be rested. Grandmother will share my little bed!" said Ada.</p>
               <p>"I cannot, I dare not!" said the old man with strange, wild energy, catching her
                  to his breast, and imprinting a wild, passionate kiss upon her lips.</p>
               <p>Then, before she could think, with bold, hurried stride, unlike the feeble steps
                  with which he entered, he hurried from the house, followed by the boy. For a
                  moment Ada stood like one petrified. Then with a quick bound she sprang to the
                  door which was left open, closed and bolted it. Then, sinking trembling and
                  helpless into a chair, she burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"Child, child, what did he mean! How strange!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, grandmother," sobbed Ada, "he was not an old man. He had terrible strength.
                  My frame aches with the wild force with which he hugged me to his form. His lips
                  were like burning coals of fire. He was some one in disguise. God protect me! I
                  fear some terrible danger, some terrible danger!"</p>
               <p>"Child, let us kneel and pray, then," said the good old lady.</p>
               <p>And they knelt, and the tremulous voice of that aged woman rose to Heaven in
                  simple eloquence—rose to Him who guides and rules the universe. Had that bold, bad
                  man gazed in through that little window then, and seen that picture, he must have
                  been a very <emph>fiend</emph>, if he could still have harbored evil designs
                  against that poor girl. How beautiful is prayer! How beautiful it is to see the
                  powerful of earth kneel beside the feeble and helpless, acknowledging the same
                  accountability to God, the same dependence upon his mercies! <emph>How beautiful
                     is prayer!</emph>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>ANOTHER day has dawned upon our history. The hour was ten. The White Cruiser lay
                  at her anchorage off the Battery, more graceful than a swan asleep upon the bosom
                  of a glassy lake. Compared with the clumsy hulls of the sloops and freight
                  schooners, which had dropped anchor in the "bight" to wait a change of tide, she
                  looked like some lovely lady suddenly introduced, in the splendor and dress of
                  fashion, into an Irish ball amongst servant girls. From her fore-truck gaily
                  flaunted the pennon of the Royal Yacht Club; from a small block fastened to her
                  main boom topping lift, over her taffrail, the gay crosses of St. George and St.
                  Andrews's fluttered. Her crew, all dressed with scrupulous neatness, were lounging
                  around the deck, while the officer whom we already know as <hi rend="i"/>Rudolph,
                  dressed in a neat and tasty uniform, paced to and fro on the quarter deck.</p>
               <p>Down in the after-cabin, the Captain was engaged in dressing himself in a
                  magnificent uniform—plain, but in material of unapparelled fineness-in cut of
                  unexceptionable fit. On a lounge lay a cast-off suit, on which a grey-haired wig
                  and a pair of goggles were cast. That suit had covered the blind man of the night
                  before. The boy Geronimo was there, but his eyes were red, as if he had been
                  weeping, or else tired with late watching. The outer-cabin had been re-arranged,
                  the plate burnished—everything in perfect order. On the side-board, wine of every
                  kind was set out—brandies with olden dates upon the black bottles—choice cordials
                  from the Indies, &amp;c. Two jet black servants, dressed in Turkish costume,
                  busied themselves in preparing for the expected visitors.</p>
               <p>Boldart had just finished his toilet, the after cabin had also been cleared up,
                  when Rudolph appeared below.</p>
               <p>"They are coming, mon Capitan!" he said.</p>
               <p>"My <emph>lord</emph>, if you please, Rudolph, while we are in port!" said
                  Boldart, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"My lord, your visiters are coming—two boats are crossing from that sloop yacht!"
                  said Rudolph, smiling again.</p>
               <p>"Very good, Mr. Masterton—very good sir!" said Boldart, imitating the stiff,
                  haughty bearing of his assumed station, and also altering his American accent.
                  "Receive them on deck, and bring them below!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, my lord!"</p>
               <p>Ten minutes elapsed. Boldart, or my lord Platimere, as he must now be called, had
                  lighted a cherrot, and was seated in his after-cabin, glancing carelessly over a
                  paper. The golden lamp above had been lighted, and cast a clear. brilliant light
                  over the splendid apartment. A pleasant perfume, like that of the magnolia, seemed
                  to pervade the room. Steps were heard in the outer cabin. Rudolph entered, and
                  announced several visiters, whose cards he bore.</p>
               <p>"Admit them, Mr. Masterson!" said Platimere, rising; "admit them, and order in
                  refreshments in five minutes!"</p>
               <p>Six gentlemen came in with Rudolph—the first, a fine, manly, stalwart-looking man,
                  of about fifty years of age, or a little more, introduced himself as Mr. Stefans,
                  and then separately introduced his companions, who<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6988-00000019"/> were all younger than he, respectively as Messrs.
                  Knedgar, Flourer, Birclay, Towns-point and Portier, the latter being a tall,
                  elegant-looking man; who seemed to be the oracle of the party in sporting matters
                  for as soon as the gentlemen were seated, and conversation commenced on such
                  things he was listened to by all. In a few moments wine and fruits were brought in
                  on massive golden salvers, by the servants.</p>
               <p>"Ah. my lord!" said Mr. Stefans, "your countrymen alone understand carrying
                  yachting to perfection! Here in America, we are too commercial, too mechanical,
                  too full of business to carry out such splendid arrangements for pleasure, as you
                  make!</p>
               <p>"And yet," replied Platimere, "you build the fastest vessels in the world!"</p>
               <p>"It is said we do, yet our yachts have never been fairly tested with those of your
                  country!"</p>
               <p>"Excuse me for putting in my oar!" cried Portier. "but, my lord. I made a bet of a
                  dozen on coming board, that your craft was American built! Is it not so?</p>
               <p>"You have lost!" replied Platimere; "she is built from an American model, but her
                  keel was laid near Sheerness, as you will see by her register, should you wish to
                  examine it!"</p>
               <p>"No, my lord, your word is quite sufficient. But at a glance I detected her model
                  is being decidedly American!"</p>
               <p>"It is, and I doubt if anything American, of her length of keel, can beat her
                  speed!"</p>
               <p>"Should you like to take a trial trip down our bay?" said Stefans, his intelligent
                  eyes gleaming with the anticipation of sport. "If you would, I will have the
                  'Mary,' my sloop, got under-way, and give you a chance to take away her laurels,
                  for she has never been beaten!"</p>
               <p>"Never been beaten? Then <emph>indeed</emph> I must try her, for I boast the same
                  thing with my own pet, here!"</p>
               <p>"Hurrah for a sail!" cried Portier.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how I wish the Cornucopia was down the river!" said Knedgar.</p>
               <p>"Poh," said Flourer, "I can beat <emph>her</emph> with the 'Ultertor.'"</p>
               <p>"I'll bet a thousand you can't!" cried Knedgar.</p>
               <p>"Done!" said Flourer, "name your day and distance!"</p>
               <p>"Let's settle this first race, before you arrange that!" cried Portier. "Do you
                  run for money?"</p>
               <p>"As his lordship pleases!" said Stefans.</p>
               <p>"Oh, we'll run for a trifle, say a thousand pounds, enough to make the race seem
                  interesting!" said his lordship, with well-assumed indifference.</p>
               <p>"Agreed!" said Stefans, drawing a checkbook from his pocket—"get me a pen and ink,
                  my lord, and I'll deposit a check in whose hands you please!"</p>
               <p>"Keep the check, my dear sir, till the race is over. If I lose I will pay you in
                  sovereigns. I have a few thousand aboard to pay current expenses!"</p>
               <p>"As you please. Now let us understand the conditions of the race! In the meantime
                  friend Knedgar, just do me the favor to tell my coxswain to go aboard the Mary,
                  and tell the Captain to make sail, slip her moorings, and come over here. Tell him
                  to trim up for a race, also!"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>WHILE the parties were arranging the preliminaries for the race, the swift rowing
                  gig of the Yacht Club dashed across the Hudson to a point just below Hoboken,
                  where lay the sloop Yacht we have before alluded to. She was a curious looking,
                  but still a beautiful vessel. Her hull, which was painted black, laid low and long
                  upon the water, was of immense beam, sharp forward and aft, and had no bulwarks to
                  hold the wind and impede her way. Nearly amidship heavy, longitudinal windlasses
                  were placed, purposely to raise and lower his centre board, or extra keel, if such
                  I may call the ponderous sliding keel which is in use among nearly all of our
                  river sloops, and many of our smooth water yachts.</p>
               <p>The Yacht's mast, boom and bowsprit, were immensely large—in fact, out of all
                  usual proportion, and calculated to spread an immense volume of canvas.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the boat boarded this sloop, a bustle could have been observed
                  on deck, for her crew of twelve or fourteen men, began hurriedly to loose the
                  sails and prepare to get underway. In a short time her immense mainsail was seen
                  to slide slowly up a grooved railway in her mast, and with windlasses it was
                  tautened to its utmost tension. Then, as the head of the jib was hoisted, her
                  moorings were let go, and as her prow gracefully veered toward the city, the
                  immense sail was also hoisted. Then, like some bird long rested, plying its wing
                  with fresh vigor through the air, she moved swiftly across the river, guided by a
                  practised helmsman, to join her antagonist in the coming race.</p>
               <p>The wind was fresh from the southward, so fresh that most of the river crafts had
                  taken a reef in, and the Mary with her immense mast buckling and bending under the
                  weight of her canvass, threw the white spray high above her deck as she sped so
                  rapidly through the short curling waves. In almost as little time as it takes me
                  to describe it, she had reached her position and was hove too off the battery,
                  close alongside of "The White Cruiser."</p>
               <p>"By Jupiter she is a beauty!" said the Captain of the latter craft, as he gazed in
                  admiration upon her. "I fear, Mr. Stefans, that I shall lose my stake!"</p>
               <p>"There may be some danger of it, but let us test it, I am impatient to enjoy this
                  breeze! Portier has drawn up our conditions, I see!"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" said the gentleman alluded to—"you will understand them. You will first
                  toss for choice of position at the start!"</p>
               <p>"No need of that!" cried Platimere, "I yield it to the sloop!"</p>
               <p>"Well, as you choose, sir, but you are very generous. The distance is around the
                  buoy placed on the lower point of the highest bank, back into the <choice>
                     <sic>Eest</sic>
                     <corr>East</corr>
                  </choice> River, around Blackwell's Island, and down to this place of starting. As
                  the route is a difficult one, we will provide you with an experienced pilot!"</p>
               <p>"As you please, sir!" said Platimere with assumed indifference, though he knew the
                  route and the harbor full as well as any man that then stood upon his decks.</p>
               <p>"A part of us will remain on board of your craft, but I must sail the Mary
                     myself!"<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6988-00000020"/> said Stefans. "Portier, you
                  and our friend Flourer had better remain!"</p>
               <p>"They will be welcome!" said Platimere. "But it is time that my bird began to
                  plume her wings. Mr. Masterson, call all hands to loose sail, and stand by to get
                  her underway!"</p>
               <p>"Are you going to sail with yonder clipper sloop, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, boy—dost think our chance a bad one?"</p>
               <p>Yes, my lord, with our yards across and the wind fresh ahead; too fresh to carry
                  our topsails off a wind. Hadn't we better send them down?"</p>
               <p>"No, I'll show you the use of them bye and bye! In beating down we will point them
                  to the wind, in coming up use them, for as I understand it, in this race
                  gentlemen, we are to carry all we choose!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that's in the conditions!" said Portier.</p>
               <p>"Then all is understood, gentlemen. Below with me now for a moment, to drink the
                  health of the winner?"</p>
               <p>"Agreed—the health of the winner whichever he may be!" cried every man of the
                  party, and they soon carried out their intention by "wetting" the same in some of
                  the choice wine below.</p>
               <p>The boats then transferred Mr. Stefans and those whom he selected to go with him,
                  on board of the Mary.</p>
               <p>The fore and main sail were already hoisted on board of the schooner, and her
                  anchor had been home apeak. There she lay like a couchant bloodhound held by the
                  leash, ready to be slipped. A moment more—her anchor "broke ground," her jib and
                  flying jib were run up, and she was under headway. The Mary, a hundred fathoms to
                  windward, filled away at the same instant, and off they went on the larboard tack,
                  standing toward the Jersey shore. The difference between the speed of the vessels
                  on the wind, was soon apparent, the Mary laying up closer and still head-reaching
                  on the schooner. In the first tack, the advantage of the sloop became very
                  apparent, for within a few minutes after her helm was put a-lee, she was off on
                  the other tack with everything drawing. There was a slight tone of exultation in
                  Portier's voice as he said to Platimere:</p>
               <p>"You'll scarcely win your bet, at this rate, my lord!"</p>
               <p>"The race is only commenced!" replied the latter, with a smile, as he drew a
                  handkerchief from his pocket to wipe away the spray which had just dashed in his
                  face.</p>
               <p>The sight was beautiful! Both vessels careened under the force of the freshening
                  gale, until their lee wales were hidden entirely in the foamy water—in fact the
                  schooner's deck lay three streaks under water—so much did she lay over. The sloop
                  better ballasted, and held too by her immense centre-board, gained steadily on the
                  other, gained tack after tack until when the schooner was abreast of Fort
                  Hamilton, the Mary was nearly down to the turning buoy, at least two miles
                  ahead.</p>
               <p>Platimere took it very calmly, and when Portier and Flourer expressed sympathy
                  with him on the anticipated loss of the race, he only smiled and said—"we've not
                  run the distance yet. My craft has'nt got limber yet; wait till she comes down to
                  her work!"</p>
               <p>Soon the sloop turned the buoy. As she did it, so far ahead of the other, a gun of
                  triumph was boomed from her bow, and a wild hurra followed the report across the
                  waters, from the throats of the elated crew. Platimere smiled. His old crew marked
                  that smile—they understood it. But the newly shipped men were almost raving, to
                  see their craft so beaten by the sloop. Just after the sloop fired her gun,
                  another gun was heard, and the whirling cloud of smoke which arose told whence
                  this compliment came. A beautiful fore-topsail schooner, clipper built, with very
                  raking masts, was bounding up the harbor under every stitch of canvass which she
                  could show. Her colors betokened her character. She was a Revenue cutter. When the
                  sloop turned the buoy, the cutter was exactly abreast of her, and as the White
                  Cruiser stood down the bay on her last tack, Platimere and his companions could
                  see that the cutter was gradually drawing ahead of the sloop.</p>
               <p>"The race is mine, easily!" said Platimere, when he observed this. "I could beat
                  that cutter before the wind without setting a topsail!"</p>
               <p>In a short time the schooner was at the buoy, and just before he turned it,
                  Platimere spoke to his officer:</p>
               <p>"Let the hands go aloft and loose the topsails, stand by with the studding sails,
                  and get the square-sail on to her!" he cried.</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, my lord!" was the reply: the hands were aloft in a moment, and as the
                  beautiful vessel turned the buoy the canvas fell from the gaskets, was sheeted
                  home, and soon every spar was bending under additional weight—the vessel appearing
                  to those who were ahead of her like a perfect cloud of canvas. Soon it became
                  apparent that the Mary could not hold her advantage She, it was true, carried an
                  immense spread of canvas, but it was <emph>nothing</emph> to the amount now
                  stretched on the spars of the White Cruiser. The Revenue cutter, joining in the
                  spirit of the race, was also pressing all the sail she could show, studding sails,
                  top gallant sails, &amp;c. The wind blowing directly up the bay gave
                     <emph>them</emph> a chance, which the sloop had not, of spreading on either
                  sides their broad studding sails. Before the sloop had reached quarrantine ground
                  on her way back, the schooner was so close that conversation could be held by
                  those on board. The cutter was still ahead, but the Cruiser was rapidly
                  overhauling her.</p>
               <p>The speed of the White Cruiser seemed to increase as she neared the city, and
                  before the cutter had reached the narrows between the city and Governor's Island,
                  the two vessels were yard arm and yard arm, so close that the features of those on
                  either could be distinguished reciprocally by the others. A keen eye would have
                  observed that Boldart seemed to avoid exposing his face in the direction of the
                  cutter, and a quick ear might have heard Rudolph say in an under tone—"Yon is the
                  same craft that came so near overhauling us off Montauk, last summer—and there is
                  the same squint eyed Captain that was aboard of her then!"</p>
               <p>"What yacht is that?" cried the officer alluded to, from the quarter-deck of the
                  cutter.</p>
               <p>"Answer him, Mr. Masterton!" said Boldart.</p>
               <p>"Lord Platimere's—the Cobra di Capello!" replied Rudolph.</p>
               <p>"Lord Platimere, eh? She looks like a craft I've seen in these waters before!"
                  muttered the officer.</p>
               <p>"Aye, your honor!" said a white haired old tar who stood at the wheel, "I've seen
                  her before as sure as I'm Jack Brace!"</p>
               <p>"When you come to an anchor I'll do myself the honor to call on his lordship!"
                  continued the officer, aloud. "You have a beautiful craft and her heels are smooth
                  indeed, when she goes by the fastest cutter in the service!"</p>
               <p>"You'll be very welcome, sir!" said Masterton, in a tone slightly ironical—we
                  shall come too in our berth opposite the Battery after our race is over!"</p>
               <p>The Cruiser, during all this time, had been gradually drawing ahead, until now she
                  had left the cutter directly in her wake Her course, too, was somewhat altered as
                  she headed into the East river. The cutter now braced in her fore-yard, flattened
                  in her main sheet, and luffed up for the usual cutter anchorage off south
                  Brooklyn.</p>
               <p>The sloop—full three quarters of a mile astern, was heaving up a ridge of foam
                  under her bows, but gradually losing ground. Yet her owner did not at all despair
                  of winning the race, he knew that in coming back after rounding the Island, they
                  would again have the wind ahead, and a narrow channel to work in which would
                  restore the advantage which he lost before the wind.</p>
               <p>The cruiser sped on, swift as a bird, through the narrow reach between the two
                  cities, gazed at by admiring thousands, who were gathered upon the wharves and
                     aboard<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6988-00000021"/> the shipping on either hand.
                  Platimere seemed to feel easier as soon as the cutter was clear of him, and paid
                  more attention to the sailing of his craft. When she had got up by the "Hook," the
                  pilot was about heading her into the western channel.</p>
               <p>"Go through the eastern channel?" said Platimere.</p>
               <p>"The tide is in our favor and will hold so half an hour yet, my Lord!" replied the
                  pilot, "and it runs full two knots faster in the western channel!"</p>
               <p>"Never mind that, I prefer the other!" said the commander.</p>
               <p>"You seem quite well acquainted with our channels, my Lord!" said Portier.</p>
               <p>"Yes, for I have been through here several times. I have not mentioned, I believe,
                  that I once held a berth in her Majesty's Navy, and was here in a gun brig. I have
                  a desire to see a spot that I once visited with a reverent pleasure—you can see it
                  opening to view now!"</p>
               <p>"Which do you mean, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Do you see that immense willow which stands on the bank of the river, east of the
                  upper end of the Island?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is Washington's old Head Quarters!"</p>
               <p>"True, and for that I once visited it! In the cottage which is embowered by the
                  drooping branches of that venerable tree—he once found rest from the toils of
                  battle and the wearing cares of station. There he for a few hours found, in the
                  forgetfulness of sleep, a brief repose from the labors and responsibilities of his
                  command!"</p>
               <p>"Washington then is a favorite character with you?"</p>
               <p>"Most truly, so, even though he humbled the pride of my native land. His name and
                  his glory is the property of all the world. Kings never speak of him without
                  respect—peasants in foreign lands are heard to utter his name with reverence—ah.
                  Mr. Masterton hand me the spy glass if you please!"</p>
               <p>This latter exclamation was caused by the appearance of a female form standing
                  upon the grassy slope in front of the old cottage.</p>
               <p>"It is her!" muttered the Captain, "it is her—by heaven's, how beautiful!"</p>
               <p>"What do you see—a sail in sight, my lord?" asked Portier, who noticed the
                  direction in which the spy-glass was pointed.</p>
               <p>"Aye, and a pretty craft she is; clipper built, with golden streamers waving in
                  the breeze! She <emph>is</emph> a beauty, is she not?"</p>
               <p>"Your lordship has the advantage of us, in being able to judge through your glass.
                  We cannot distinguish a feature, yet there are the outlines of a pretty form, I
                  should judge!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, magnificent, magnificent!" muttered the Captain, keeping his gaze still
                  fixed upon her.</p>
               <p>Oh how little did she think whose basilisk eye was then revelling in ideal lust
                  upon her fair face and sweet figure. Had she known it, she would have fled within
                  the portals of those sacred walls which he had already desecrated by his profane
                  presence. But no guardian angel warned her of her danger—there she stood gazing in
                  childish admiration upon the beautiful vessel, the wind playing with her uncovered
                  hair, or peeping beneath the skirts of her simple dress at ancles which an Elsler
                  might have envied. There she stood until the vessel was past, and while she stood
                  there, that spy glass was not removed from the eye of him who held it.</p>
               <p>"You seem quite smitten, my lord!" said Portier.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly smitten, but yon girl is a rare beauty!"</p>
               <p>"Beauty is not <emph>uncommon</emph> here, my lord—and singular as it may seem,
                  the most beautiful girls of our land are found among the working classes!"</p>
               <p>"That is but natural. They are not reared up in sickening luxury—they are not
                  bound up in whalebone and cords—they are not nursed in the sickly walls of
                     <emph>fashionable</emph> seminaries and taught that it is
                     '<emph>unladylike</emph>' to walk out and breathe the fresh air; they take
                  proper exercise; their food, though plain, is strong and healthy; they apply no
                  cosmetics to their complexion and require none. It is but natural then that they
                  should be the most beautiful!"</p>
               <p>"True, my lord, you are right. But see, we are approaching 'the Gate,' a place
                  sadly well known to many a wrecked coaster!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Masterton, stand by to in with all the square sails, and to bring her on
                  a wind under her fore and aft canvass, as we round the point!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, my lord!" replied the officer, stationing his hands at clewlines and
                  down hauls, prepared at the proper moment, to trim the craft for the hardest
                  portion of her race. Soon the grey rocks of Hurl Gate loomed up close before them.
                  Then, in almost a moment's time the quick handed crew of the Cruiser, hauled down,
                  clewed up, and took in the square sail, the sheets of the fore and aft sails were
                  trimmed aft, and the schooner was brought up to the wind. The sloop which had
                  chosen the western channel, and its advantages, was seen about a mile and a half
                  up the channel, coming down 'with a bone in her teeth,' under her immense sails.
                  The tide however began to slack, and the schooner dashed along in her short tacks
                  as swiftly as ever. Soon the sloop passed in hailing distance.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of my craft, now?" asked Boldart.</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you after the race is over!" said Stefans. 'There's many a slip between
                  the cup and the lip!"</p>
               <p>The next instant they were both beyond hailing distance. The sloop was now to go
                  down to the point, turn it, and beat up, and as the schooner had so much start, it
                  was evident that the race must be a close one, Tack after tack was made; each one
                  a slow but sure gain, until again both crafts were in the narrows of the river,
                  between Brooklyn and New York.</p>
               <p>Long before this the people on the shore had heard of the race which was now being
                  run, and crowds of people were on the wharves and at the Battery to witness its
                  termination. The sloop had gained rapidly on the schooner, but the latter still
                  led the way, and so far too that it seemed impossible that she could be overtaken
                  by the sloop in the short distance yet to be run. Two tacks more, and the vessels
                  almost side by side, headed in for their anchorage. Now, both aboard and ashore,
                  the people kept silent—silent with anxiety and interest. Another minute would
                  decide the matter; the schooner being a little to windward. Now they were side by
                  side, but here the tall sails of the schooner kept the wind from the sloop, the
                  latter again dropped a little, and as the schooner reached the stake boat, she was
                  a winner by only about her own length.</p>
               <p>Then arose from the deck and shore, one loud, general cheer in honor of the
                  victor. Stefans came on board soon after, both vessels having come to anchor, the
                  lost wager was paid and the evening was passed in festivity.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>THE rest of the day and a part of the evening was spent hilariously on board of
                  the White Cruiser. Mr. Stefans and his companions proved to be staunch old
                  veterans at the wine bottle; men who could stow away their three bottles and still
                  keep on an even keel. Song and jest, glee and story went around, and all hands
                  seemed in as happy a mood as men well could be in. While things were thus going on
                  below, Mr. Masterton, alias Rudolph, was pacing the deck above. An anchor watch
                  was seated forward on the heel of the bowsprit, and further aft a knot of men were
                  seated by the hatchway spinning yarns in a low quiet tone. Suddenly the measured
                  stroke of oars betokened the approach of one of those heavy, double banked boats
                  used by our vessels of war. Nearer and nearer it came, until in the gloom, Rudolph
                  could see it was coming aboard. In an instant he whispered an order to one of the
                  men, who conveyed it to the rest, and all went below out of sight, preserving
                  perfect silence. Then he hailed.</p>
               <p>"Boat ahoy!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye!" was the response, by which all nautical readers will understand that a
                  lieutenant was in the boat.</p>
               <p>Before Rudolph could again speak, the boat manned by sixteen men, was alongside,
                  and an officer in the uniform of the Revenue service sprang on deck.</p>
               <p>"Good evening sir," he said, politely touching his laced cap to Rudolph. "I am
                  sent by Captain Dartmoor, of the Nautilus, to examine your papers, and also to
                  request the honor of a visit from your commander."</p>
               <p>"Our papers, sir," said Rudolph, haughtily, "can be seen; they have been already
                  examined at the Custom House, and we are regularly entered. Lord Platimere is
                  engaged with <emph>friends</emph>, and will not be disturbed; therefore, excuse my
                  inviting you below. I will bring up the papers."</p>
               <p>So saying Rudolph left the deck, but in a moment returned, bringing the register
                  of the yacht Cobra di Capello, and other papers, which he handed the officer to
                  examine by the binnacle light.</p>
               <p>The latter scanned them very closely, and at last said: "These <emph>seem</emph>
                  regular, but they say your yacht is English built."</p>
               <p>"They do, sir!"</p>
               <p>"And do you pretend to say that this craft was ever built in <emph>England?</emph>
                  This hull—those spars—or even that she was <emph>rigged</emph> there?"</p>
               <p>"Pretend to say, sir officer? <emph>Pretend?</emph> There, sir, are her regular
                  papers. Deny their authority if you dare. You Yankees may perhaps be used to
                  giving or bearing the <emph>lie;</emph> but know, sir, that I will not endure a
                  doubt!"</p>
               <p>"If you can help yourself, my little bantam!" said the officer cooly. "But there's
                  no use in bandying words. I want to see this Lord Platimere!"</p>
               <p>"You cannot, sir; he is engaged with <emph>gentlemen!</emph>" said Rudolph,
                  pointedly.</p>
               <p>"I demand, as an officer of the Revenue, to see him, and if you give me much more
                  trouble, I'll search your vessel from truck to kelson; for I don't believe all's
                  right aboard!"</p>
               <p>"If you give us any more of your insolence lence," said Rudolph, angrily, "you'll
                  be <emph>right over</emph>-board!"</p>
               <p>"What's the matter here? What is this man doing here, and what does he want?" said
                  Boldart himself, whose quick ear had heard the sound of angry voices on deck.</p>
               <p>"Are you the man they call Lord Platimere, the owner of this craft?"</p>
               <p>"I am, fellow—what of that?"</p>
               <p>"You needn't <emph>fellow</emph> me, sir. I'm as good as you are, if you are a
                  lord! I came aboard on duty—to see your papers, and also to request you to visit
                  Captain Dartmoor aboard of the cutter Nautilus, the cutter you beat to-day with
                  your <emph>English</emph>-built craft!"</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry to disappoint your Captain, but I never call on strangers—if he wants
                  to see <emph>me</emph>, let him come here?"</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir, I will report your answer—but you will excuse me if I leave a
                  couple of my men aboard here!"</p>
               <p>"No sir; my crew is sufficiently large, already!"</p>
               <p>"You don't understand me, sir,—I must be <emph>plain</emph>. There
                     <emph>are</emph> some discrepencies in your papers—this craft looks like a
                  vessel which we once before had a chase after in the Sound, and out by Montauk,
                  for heavy smuggling transactions; and until our suspicions are cleared up, we have
                  a <emph>right</emph> to keep an eye upon your movements!"</p>
               <p>"A right which I deny and will resist, sir!" said Boldart, his voice being husky
                  with anger. "You will leave my deck, sir—I will report you to your Port Collector
                  in the morning!"</p>
               <p>"I will not leave your deck," said the officer, firmly, "but will at once take
                  charge of it. Come aboard from the boat, four of you Nautilus men, and the rest
                  take the boat back and tell Captain Dartmoor I want to see him here!"</p>
               <p>Four armed men sprang from the boat and stood beside their officer, while the boat
                  was pushed from the side to obey his orders. But Boldart was not a man to be thus
                  surprised, and Rudolph in ordering the men below had also given them directions to
                  be prepared for service. Therefore, as the boat shoved off, and its oars began to
                  dip in the water, a dozen men stealthily and silently came up from the hatchway,
                  where they had heard all that had passed, and unobserved by the officer and his
                  men, whose faces were turned aft, confronting Boldart and Rudolph, approached
                  close at their backs.</p>
               <p>Boldart saw them, and in a quick tone, too low to be heard below, said.</p>
               <p>"Seize, gag and bind them!"</p>
               <p>Scarce were the words out of his mouth before the Revenue officer and his men lay
                  helpless on their backs, held in the grasp of strong men, their voices stifled by
                  hands held over them. A moment more and they were gagged and bound.</p>
               <p>"Stow them away below!" said Boldart, "and then out with the gig and whale-boat.
                  All depends upon your overtaking their boat before she reaches the cutter—if you
                  succeed and capture them quietly, without causing an alarm, all is safe till
                  morning, if not, we must slip our cable and fight our way out of a bad hobble.
                  Rudolph, go in the gig—I leave all to you!"</p>
               <p>"I will have them as safe as you have these dogs, and that inside of ten minutes!"
                  said Rudolph, jumping into one of the boats, which immediately afterwards dashed
                  off, followed by another, in pursuit of the cutter's boat.</p>
               <p>"And I'll go below and fix some punch to straighten out my guests, for fear I'll
                  have to send them ashore suddenly!" said Boldart, suiting the action to the
                  word.</p>
               <p>Rudolph's boat was soon close in the wake of the cutter's barge—and his oars being
                  leathered with double thicknesses of heavy buckskin, gave it no sound to warn the
                  pursued of the vicinity of the pursuers. The oars were dipped so lightly in the
                  water, and when there, pulled so steadily, that scarce a splash, loud as the dip
                  of an Indians paddle could be heard. But the great lumbering barge made a noise
                  with her heavy oars in their metal row-locks—that could have been heard a full
                  mile across the water. She had reached nearly half her distance to the cutter,
                  when her crew felt a<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6988-00000023"/> shock as the bow of
                  the other boat ranged alongside of her quarter, and the next moment a dozen men
                  were grappling with them. Though taken entirely by surprise, and unable in the
                  darkness to know who were their foes, what their number, or how they were
                  armed—the brave fellows were not non-resistant, and the sharp reports of two or
                  three pistols rung in quick succession—while shouts and groans told of the strife
                  which was going on. Rudolph, in vain bade his men be silent—and when in a moment
                  or two more he saw lights moved quickly to and fro about the dark hall of the
                  cutter whose spars loomed up between them and the horizon—he knew that the sooner
                  he was back aboard of his craft the better for him. Shouting to his men to back
                  off, he sprang into his own boat again, followed by all but two of his men—who
                  were either killed or disabled—he knew not which—and dashed back.</p>
               <p>We will now glance at the Cruiser and her commander. When Rudolph shoved
                  of—Boldart hurried below and began mixing a punch, the potency of which would soon
                  have laid his guests under the table had they partaken of it. But ere he had
                  concocted the beverage, his quick ear caught the sound of the pistols, and
                  hurrying on deck he soon heard enough to satisfy him that there was hot work
                  before him. Ordering the Yacht Club men into their boats, he stepped below, and
                  with a calm politeness which astonished his hearers, said:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen it is with pain that I find our festivities must end at once. The
                  commander of the Revenue cutter which came up the Bay this afternoon has taken it
                  into his head that I am a smuggler, and has sent a boat aboard. I have resisted,
                  and of course I must move my berth, or get into trouble!"</p>
               <p>"A smuggler, my lord? We can testify, my lord, that you are not—"</p>
               <p>"Anything else!" said Boldart, laughing. "Gentlemen, you need not 'my lord' me any
                  more. I'm as <emph>American</emph> as any of you are, and <emph>more</emph> so,
                  for I'd see any English lord sunk ten thousand fathoms in the ocean, before I'd
                  feast him at <emph>my</emph> table. I <emph>am</emph> a smuggler—free-trader, if
                  you like the word better, and as the cutter will very likely try to make me a
                  prize—the sooner you gentlemen are out of my vicinity, the better it will be for
                  you. Lead may be flying, and steel flashing here shortly. Your boat is manned and
                  ready!"</p>
               <p>The gentlemen of the Yacht Club were so astonished that they knew not what answer
                  to make. Portier alone spoke.</p>
               <p>"You're a bold fellow?" said he. "I'd hate to see you in trouble. We'll be
                  off—you've a fine breeze—you'd better slip and run!"</p>
               <p>"I shall; to your boat, gentlemen, to your boat!" said Boldart.</p>
               <p>As the boat of the Club shoved off, Rudolph came alongside. The blood streamed
                  from a knife wound in his cheek, giving his usually pale face a ghastly
                  expression. He clutched a cutlass in his hand, the point of which was dripping
                  blood.</p>
               <p>"Well, what's up?" asked Boldart as his lieutenant sprang on the deck.</p>
               <p>"We have lost two men—they are making sail on the cutter—and <emph>hark</emph>,
                  there are boats coming now! We're in a devil of a scrape, Captain!"</p>
               <p>"It isn't the first time!" cried Boldart with a wild laugh. Then raising his
                  voice, he shouted: "Sea Serpents, to your duty. Topmen, aloft and loose every
                  sail—forward there, slip the cable—out sweeps on the starboard bow, and get her
                  head off to port! Loose that jib and run it up quick!"</p>
               <p>While the men rapidly obeyed these orders—the sound of oars came louder and louder
                  over the water. The plash of the parted cable was next heard—the heavy tug of the
                  sweeps got the schooner's head around, and then her jib was run up its stay. At
                  the same moment a boat was seen on each quarter, close aboard.</p>
               <p>"All hands repel boarders!" shouted Boldart, as at the same instant the topsails
                  fell loose from the gaskets, and filled, though not sheeted home. The fresh wind
                  in these, at once gave the schooner headway, and the boat-hooks of the Revenue
                  boats, when almost touching the schooner, fell short.</p>
               <p>"Heave too, heave too, or we'll fire into you!" shouted the gruff voice of the
                  officer in command.</p>
               <p>"Fire and be d—d!" shouted Boldart, cautioning his crew to lay low.</p>
               <p>A volly of musket balls whistled harmlessly over his head, and then the schooner,
                  with increased speed, was out of their reach. Her course was laid for the East
                  River, and by the time she was fairly into it, her sails were hoisted and sheeted
                  home.</p>
               <p>"Where is the cutter?" asked Boldart, who had been so busy making sail, that he
                  had not looked for her.</p>
               <p>An answer came before he expected it, in the shape of a round shot, which made a
                  hole in his mainsail as big as his head. The flash showed the cutter under full
                  sail, close in by the Brooklyn shore, heading out to intercept him.</p>
               <p>"Shall I get up our long Tom, sir, and return the compliment?" asked Rudolph.</p>
               <p>"Aye and bear a hand about it!" replied the other. "We may need it if she should
                  cripple any of our spars!"</p>
               <p>Two very heavy four-fold tackles which led from either mast-head, were instantly
                  joined and lowered down over the main hatch-way. In a moment a heavy, circular
                  railway gun carriage was hoisted on deck—and while some men bolted it with
                  screw-bolts into its place, (for it had often before been fitted,) the tackles
                  were again lowered and a beautiful brass twenty-four pounder was hoisted and
                  placed on the carriage. So rapidly was this done, that the schooner was not higher
                  up than the "Hook," when the gun was ready for service, and the gunners at their
                  stations.</p>
               <p>"Now let them come and look out for as good as the give!" said Boldart with the
                  same wild laugh which we have before noticed.</p>
               <p>The cutter had hove too for a moment, to take in her boats; therefore, she bad
                  lost considerable ground, and the Cruiser, now under full press of canvas, dashed
                  up the river toward Hurl Gate, like a race horse. Again she was steered for the
                  Eastern channel.</p>
               <p>"Get the boat ready—I cannot go to sea without <emph>her!</emph>" said Boldart to
                  his lieutenant.</p>
               <p>"Good Heaven's! Captain, you would not stop with the cutter so close astern—stop
                  merely for a <emph>girl?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Aye, if it so pleased me!" said the <choice>
                     <sic>oth-</sic>
                     <corr>other</corr>
                  </choice> bitterly. Then in a calmer tone he said:—</p>
               <p>"I will land with the boat—you need not stop the schooner at all, till you have
                  gained oar old hiding place; I will follow with her in the boat. It is too dark
                  for the cutter's men to see me shove off; let the boat be hauled up along side as
                  we go. In three hours I shall be with you, with my fair prize in the boat. Crowd
                  sail—you'll be far enough ahead of the cutter to slide into the creek
                  unobserved."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir, your orders shall be obeyed!"</p>
               <p>As the Cruiser drew abreast of the cottage, Boldart, armed, as was also the six
                  men who were with him, shoved off in the boat, and in a moment were lost in the
                  gloom which surrounded them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>AT the hour when the White Cruiser darted up the river, past the old cottage,
                  followed closely by the cutter in chase, Ada and her grandmother were seated in
                  precisely the same situation as they were seen when first introduced to the reader
                  of this work. The old lady was reading her bible, the young one was stitching away
                  at a garment, plying her little fingers as steadily and rapidly as if they were
                  attached to a machine, instead of a form so graceful.</p>
               <p>The fresh breeze howled and whistled through the drooping limbs of the old willow
                  tree; but the bright fire and the cosy heatness of the room made it seem but more
                  comfortable, to hear the dreary noise of the wind outside, as it does when one is
                  snug in bed and can listen to the pattering of the rain upon the roof.</p>
               <p>For a time Ada worked on in silence, but in a little while her grandmother laid
                  down her spectacles and said:</p>
               <p>"Ada, dear, there's a deal of comfort to us poor folks in this book. I've been
                  reading here that it is as easy for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle,
                  as it is for a rich man to enter Heaven. And every where I read in it, there is
                  something to cheer up the poor and the humble, but nothing to encourage the vain
                  and the haughty. Oh, what a good book is the Bible!—what a good book for poor
                  folks to read!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, grandmother; and were it more read by the rich, and its teachings obeyed,
                  there would be less wrong on earth—less oppression and crime!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, sweet child, thou art right;—but things are different now-a-days from what
                  they were when I was a girl. We had no grand churches then, but there was more
                     <emph>religion</emph> in the land. Preachers there were then, who did not
                     <emph>sell</emph> the Word of God, ride in liveried coaches, wear gowns as
                  gaudy as the actor's tinselled dress, and live more for themselves than for God
                  and their brother man—ah me, how changed, <emph>how changed!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The old lady now carefully closed the bible, replaced her spectacles in the case
                  of red leather to which they belonged, and then again spoke.</p>
               <p>"Sing me one of your sweet songs, Ada," said she—"it is so cheerful to hear your
                  voice!"</p>
               <p>"I feel sad to-night, dear grandmother!" replied the fair girl. "I know not what I
                  can sing that suits my feelings, lest it be the one I learned a few days ago."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes; well sing it child. The air is mournful, but it is sweet!"</p>
               <p>Ada was not so learned in the fashions of the day as to require much pressing, and
                  in her artless way, without laying down her work, she sung these words: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Ah, cold and bitter is the world,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Its paths are dark and drear;</l>
                        <l>To me 'tis like a wilderness,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Whose leaves are in the sere;</l>
                        <l>No flowers grow upon the ground,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">No blossoms bloom above,</l>
                        <l>And scarce a cheering ray of light</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Is with the shadow wove."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A knock at the door, a low and feeble knock, as if given by the hand of a youth,
                  or of feeble old age, was heard at that instant.</p>
               <p>"Who can it be? Don't let 'em in at this time o' night?" said the old lady who had
                  not forgotten the visit of the pretended blind man.</p>
               <p>"Who is there?" asked Ada, rising and going to the door, which was bolted
                  inside.</p>
               <p>"A poor old man who begs charity—a crust of bread and a cup of water!" said a
                  tremulous voice.</p>
               <p>"I've heard that voice before," murmured Ada, turning pale, "it is
                     <emph>he.</emph> I will not let him in. Go away," she added, in a bolder and
                  louder tone, "we too are poor and cannot help you!"</p>
               <p>"Let me rest my wearied limbs—I am faint and sick—a poor old man can do ye no
                  harm!"</p>
               <p>"Begone, sir, from the door, you are known," said Ada, trying to speak firmly, but
                  she trembled with terror.</p>
               <p>"Aye? Is it so then fair beauty?" said a voice, far different from that which she
                  had heard before, "Open the door then and save me the trouble of breaking it
                  open!"</p>
               <p>"Heaven's, grandmother, what shall we do?" cried the terrified girl.</p>
               <p>"What can we do but pray? The door is strong—they cannot break it down so easy!"
                  said the old lady, kneeling, with her hands laid upon the table.</p>
               <p>But Ada seemed to believe in a more active resistance than prayer, for she rushed
                  to the fire-place and seized a large iron poker with which she hurried back to the
                  door.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, <emph>no</emph> trifling—will you open the door!" said the loud clear
                  voice outside.</p>
               <p>"Never, villain, never!" said Ada, gaining more nerve.</p>
               <p>"Then we'll do it for you! Put your shoulders to the door, men, and in with
                  it!"</p>
               <p>Ada could hear each movement but though the door cracked and shook under their
                  strength, still it did not give way—it was of oak, massive, and barred so
                  strongly.</p>
               <p>"Heave men, heave your whole power on the cursed door—we have no time to
                  spare!"</p>
               <p>They redoubled their efforts, but did not succeed.</p>
               <p>"If we had an axe we could hew it down!" cried the man who had before spoken.</p>
               <p>For a few moments now, all was still, and Ada fancied she heard them retiring, but
                  then, a wild shriek from her grandmother, who was kneeling before the window, told
                  of a new danger. The same instant she saw the lattice and frame work of the window
                  driven in by a heavy piece of timber, and while yet the ring of the broken glass
                  was on the ear, three or four men sprang in. She recognised the foremost as the
                  man who had followed her in the city, and to the steamboat, but ere she could
                  utter more than one scream—a shrill cry of mortal terror, she was clasped in his
                  arms and borne toward the door which the others instantly unbarred. The
                  grandmother had fainted, and lay senseless on the floor. But a moment, and poor
                  Ada was past the threshold of the door. Again she cried wildly for help, and at
                  the very instant, as if God had sent him there to her aid, the young mate of the
                  steamboat, who had once before served her, and taught Boldart his strength, stood
                  face to face with him—then struck full in the face by the heavy fist of the
                  stalwart son of Manhattan's Isle, the pirate fell back on the door sill of the
                  cottage, still clinging to his fair and now senseless prize. The mate bent down to
                  snatch her from his polluting grasp, but he was fated to fail in his noble aim,
                  for the contents of a pistol, which had been drawn by Boldart, lodged in his body,
                  and he reeled forward and fell bleeding upon them. The pirate, aided by his men,
                  was up in an instant, and clasping the senseless girl again to his breast, he bore
                  her with rapid strides to his boat. The crew took their seats, and the boat was
                  soon under rapid headway.—She had not pulled more than a dozen lengths, however,
                  when oars were heard out in the channel, and by the sound, they discovered that a
                  boat was making toward the shore. Pulling lightly, with their muffled oars, they
                  were undetected by the other boat, which had just shoved from the cutter, probably
                  on account of the shot which was heard from the shore, or perhaps the piercing<pb
                     n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6988-00000025"/> ing shrieks of Ada, or the sounds of
                  strife had reached the quick ears of those on board, who were watching in the
                  gloom for some sign of the Cruiser. A low sardonic laugh burst from the lips of
                  Boldart, as he glanced, first at the fair form which yet lay helpless in his arms,
                  and then at the dark sails of the cutter which was vainly pursuing his own swift
                  and beautiful craft.</p>
               <p>"The Sea Serpent has got too much start to be bothered by him now!" he muttered.
                  "She'll be in the creek in an hour or more, and then all will be safe; three hours
                  more, if ye pull strong my hearties, will see us safe aboard, and then by
                  to-morrow night we'll once more seek our fortunes on blue water?"</p>
               <p>The crew made no reply, but bent with renewed force to their oars, sending their
                  sharp boat more rapidly than ever through the water.</p>
               <p>Poor Ada!—how long she lay senseless in the arms of the villainous abductor she
                  knew not, but when she recovered, the boat was out on the Sound, gloom and
                  darkness all around, and her form was drenched in the spray which was dashed over
                  the boat. She could see no land—but it was close aboard on the left, and though it
                  still was dark as pitch, day was near at hand.</p>
               <p>"Oh Heaven, where am I?" she murmured, for in the darkness she could not even see
                  the face of him who yet held her.</p>
               <p>"With one who loves thee maiden, and who can appreciate thy rare beauty!" said the
                  pirate imprinting a burning kiss upon her pure lips.</p>
               <p>"Nay, do not struggle, 'tis useless, you are forever mine!" he said, as she
                  endeavored to move; "be quiet, we will soon be aboard of our beautiful craft, and
                  there you shall see comforts and luxuries which a princess of royal blood cannot
                  command!"</p>
               <p>The poor girl shuddered, but it was not in her power to resist, it seemed as if
                  the God of mercy had deserted her.</p>
               <p>"Give way, strong, men!—give way, strong, or we will not reach the creek before
                  daylight," cried the pirate.</p>
               <p>It was indeed time that they did, for as she spoke, the <choice>
                     <sic>redish</sic>
                     <corr>reddish</corr>
                  </choice> tinge in the east began to foretell the coming dawn.</p>
               <p>We will now, dear reader, take a retrospective or perspective glance, if you
                  please, at the other parties afloat. First, the Cruiser, under the skilful charge
                  of Rudolph, who was a good sailor and an experienced pilot. She sped on through
                  the Gate and up the sound, far ahead of her pursuers. When she was some fifteen or
                  eighteen miles up she began to haul in toward the Long Island shore, and Rudolph,
                  standing forward with a night-glass, began to look for his land-mark, while one of
                  the men close by him kept heaving the lead, telling him in a low voice at every
                  cast, the depth of the water, and the nature of the bottom as felt by the
                  lead.</p>
               <p>The schooner kept on this way for some time, when Rudolph ordered every sail in,
                  except the mainsail and jib, and as soon as they were furled he hauled directly in
                  for a high hummock of trees nearly east of him. The lead was still kept
                  going—still his eye was at the glass, and from time to time he gave his orders to
                  luff or keep off. Not more than ten minutes elapsed, when, to those who knew not
                  the secret, she seemed to be going right ashore; but instead of that she glided
                  into a narrow creek, the banks of which were high, and so thickly covered with
                  trees, that the moment she was inside of it, the wind was not felt, and her sails
                  were becalmed.</p>
               <p>Her headway was sufficient to keep her under steerage way for some time, and the
                  glided on up the narrow creek for several hundred feet, and rounding a sudden turn
                  in the stream entered a small bay or cove, where she was moored to trees on the
                  bank. Her sails were taken in and furled, her watch stationed at the posts and the
                  rest of the crew sent below to rest. Rudolph remained on deck anxiously waiting
                  for his commander. The boy Geronimo too passed the night on deck, thinking of his
                  master and plotting a way to remove the fair girl whom his master loved, from a
                  chance of rivalry with his mother.</p>
               <p>We will now return to the cutter. When the lieutenant got on board of her and
                  reported the treatment he had received from the White Cruiser and her crew,
                  Captain Dartmoor's rage knew no bounds. He swore by the "big oyster" (a terrible
                  oath with him) that he'd blow the infernal Englishman out of water. He was obliged
                  as we have already seen, to heave too to get his boats hoisted up and to get the
                  dead and wounded men aboard. In doing this he lost time, and when after filling
                  away again, he looked for the White Cruiser, she had disappeared up the Sound. But
                  he knew that she could only escape by the way of Montauk point and that ere she
                  could reach that she would have to run the gauntlet of several cutters which were
                  stationed in the Sound. And fast as she was, he knew that his own craft could keep
                  her close aboard, at any rate near enough to alarm the other cutters, and the
                  forts at New London and Newport with her guns.—Observing the course which the
                  Cruiser was steering when last seen, he had the cutter headed for the eastern
                  channel off Black-well's Island, and was well ahead in the reach when the pistol
                  shot on shore, and the sound of strife reached his cars. He instantly hove too and
                  sent a boat on shore under command of his lieutenant, hoping he would get some
                  clue to the missing craft. The boat soon returned, bringing the bleeding form of
                  the wounded mate, Dick Isherwood, who though badly injured was still able to give
                  an account of the abduction, and a description of the abductor.</p>
               <p>When Dartmoor and his lieutenant heard the description, they both united in
                  expressing their belief that the abductor was none else than the self styled Lord
                  Platimere, the very man they were in chase of.</p>
               <p>"If he landed in a boat and went off in one, he must be close to us now—have a
                  bright look-out kept, Mr. Swivel!" said. Dartmoor.</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, Sir—I wish daylight would open its rosy lips and swallow this infernal
                  darkness, I hate playing at hide and seek in this devilish channel—there are rocks
                  enough in it to pave 'the road to boundless wealth' or build a jug to keep the
                  Devil in!"</p>
               <p>'Lord love you, sir," said Jack Brace, who stood at the helm, "I know every rock
                  of them all, as well as a sow knows her own pigs. I'll steer the Nautilus betwixt
                  'em just as easy as getting married!"</p>
               <p>"But if you hit one of 'em, it would be all up with us, as hard as getting
                  unmarried after the knot was tied!"</p>
               <p>While this conversation was going on and the schooner was dashing through the
                  whirling eddies of Hurl Gate, Captain Dartmoor was aiding the surgeon in dressing
                  the wounds of Isherwood and the others of the crew, who had been injured in the
                  boat conflict. One of the men from the White Cruiser still lived, the other was
                  dead. The wounded man was, however, near his death. A cutlass thrust through his
                  abdomen had left a gap which tempted life to quit the field and try another
                  pasture.</p>
               <p>"That fellow will die, won't he Doctor?" asked Dartmoor.</p>
               <p>"It is my decided opinion, based on scientific principles, that he will collapse
                  before the sun attains its meridian height and noon-day glory!" said the
                  sentimental surgeon, who was a volunteer medical student, who came aboard to read
                  Byron, see the ocean and practise physic—three very sublime employments.</p>
               <p>"Then I must question him and find out who his master is!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>IT was dawn. The Captain of the cutter was on deck scanning the reach of his
                  vision with his eye-glass. His lieutenant was on the foretopsail yard, with a
                  glass in his hand. The cutter under a full press of sail was dashing up the Sound
                  swift as a gull scudding before a gale. On the trunk of the cabin, reclining on a
                  mattress, but with his head so raised that he too could look over the water, lay
                  the wounded steamboat mate.</p>
               <p>"Dy'e see anything afloat?" asked the captain. "No sign of the schooner, eh, Mr.
                  Swivel?"</p>
               <p>"I thought I saw a boat in under the land just now, about a point for'ard of our
                  beam, but I've lost her again, sir! No—there she is by thunder! Luff a couple of
                  points, look Sir, she's in under the shore just by that high point!"</p>
               <p>"So she is,—I see her, and by the 'big oyster.' there's calico in her! That's our
                  man, haul her closer to the wind, Brace! Come aft men and trim in sheets and
                  braces! Bear a hand—the craft isn't far away, if the skipper is so near!" cried
                  the Captain.</p>
               <p>The schooner was immediately close-hauled on the wind, her yards braced up, tacks
                  hauled down and sheets flattened aft to alter her course for the high headland
                  already mentioned. Of course, even in a cutter, where the discipline is more
                  "slack" than it is aboard of a regular man o' war, the execution of these orders
                  created considerable confusion. And when everything below was right, the captain
                  hailed the lieutenant aloft.</p>
               <p>"D'ye see the boat yet, Mr. Swivel?"</p>
               <p>"No sir, she's either sunk or run into some cranny o' them rocks. I had my eye on
                  her, till you commenced bracing in the foretopsail yard, then I dropped my eye, to
                  hold on, and when I looked again where it was and where she ought to be, she was
                  like the Irishman's ilea, I couldn't put a finger on her!"</p>
               <p>"She must have gone in there somewhere?"</p>
               <p>"Or gone <emph>down</emph>, Captain! I can't see a hole or a cranny for her to go
                  into, but that she has disappeared is a <choice>
                     <sic>lemoncholy</sic>
                     <corr>melancholy</corr>
                  </choice> fact'"</p>
               <p>The captain scanned the shore a little while. He saw no sign of a place for an
                  entrance. The coast was hold and rocky. His vessel was now as close in as he dared
                  to take her, for there were pointed rocks and many a hidden shoal, which had not
                  then been laid down in charts. "It can't be given up so!" he muttered. "She is
                  here somewhere!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>she</emph> is there somewhere," said Dick Isherwood, "and I'm bound to
                  get <emph>her</emph> out of the muss! Captain, put your craft through, I'm weak as
                  an old maid's blush, but only let me get my flippers on that bloody pirate once,
                     <emph>only</emph> once and d—n me into a dock-loafer, or a regular Jakey
                  Beedel, and he is one of the God-forsaken, if he ever gets loose of me!"</p>
               <p>"She's here somewhere, his boat never <unclear>sank</unclear>, and his craft—ah, I
                  didn't think of the wounded prisoner. Tell the Doctor I want to see him."</p>
               <p>The cadaverous student before alluded to appeared on deck at this summons. His
                  uncombed hair, and the garden-spots in the corner of each eye indicated that he
                  had just turned out.</p>
               <p>"Doctor, how's that bloody pirate getting along?" asked the Captain.</p>
               <p>"Not having investigated his case, which in my private opinion is a d—d bad one,
                  since last night, I cannot on scientific principles—"</p>
               <p>"Curse your <emph>scientific principles</emph>, is the fellow alive?"</p>
               <p>"To the best of my belief, Captain Dartmoor, he is. I heard him grunt as I came up
                  the companion ladder!"</p>
               <p>"Had he his senses about him?"</p>
               <p>"Not having examined him, I cannot, basing my reply on scientific principles,
                  say!"</p>
               <p>"D—n your scientific principles, go and see whether he is fit to answer
                  questions!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, Sir—understanding the hernacular, I have but to obey!"</p>
               <p>In a few moments the doctor re-appeared on deck.</p>
               <p>"Well, how is the fellow?" asked Dartmoor.</p>
               <p>"My opinion, based on scientific—"</p>
               <p>"D—n your principles, how is he!"</p>
               <p>"Sir! Captain Dartmoor, I didn't come aboard of this craft to have my principles
                  d—d! Damn <emph>me</emph> as much as you please, but sir, let <emph>science</emph>
                  alone! I'll be d—d if <choice>

                  </choice> permit you or anybody in the United States Revenue Service to d—n my
                  principles!"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, we wont argue that point now, but can the fellow reply to a question
                  or two?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you ask him before the breath leaves him, and you'll have to hurry!"</p>
               <p>"Bring him on deck!"</p>
               <p>Three or four of the crew who had been listening to the conversation obeyed, and
                  in a moment the wounded seaman was brought upon deck and seated near
                  Isherwood.—For a moment his eye scanned the horrizon—it rested a moment on the
                  high headland, then while his pale lip curled triumphantly he muttered, "<emph>the
                     beauty is safe!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Where is your craft—where is her hiding place? Tell me, for you've but a little
                  while to live, your tide is on the ebb!'</p>
               <p>"You <emph>think</emph> so?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>know</emph> so, you wretch! The doctor there will tell you so!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Captain, I suppose you'd like a <emph>confession</emph> from me—have you
                  the power to grant me absolution for all my sins. I'm <emph>only</emph> a pirate
                  you know!"</p>
               <p>"Where is your master, where is his craft—is he a kin to the devil, that he can
                  become invisible?"</p>
               <p>"Go into the cove and try him, you bloody fresh-water shark!"</p>
               <p>"Into the cove? What does he mean? There must be a cove hereabouts, or he wouldn't
                  speak of it now!"</p>
               <p>"He is dying—I base my opinion on scientific principles!" said the doctor.</p>
               <p>"The Cruiser is safe—you may all go to thunder!" gasped the man.</p>
               <p>"Speak, where is she?" cried Dartmoor, "your minutes are numbered, you are dying,
                  tell me where she is?"</p>
               <p>"Go to—to the <emph>cove</emph>!" gasped the man. He fell back—there was a
                  spasmodic motion of his lips, but he never spoke again. He was <emph>dead!</emph>

               <p>"<emph>The Cove!</emph> Two or three times that fellow spoke of the Cove! It must
                  be a hiding place alongshore in there that that schooner is in! She couldn't have
                  reached quite out of sight of us, so soon in the open Sound? She must be in here
                  somewhere. Mr. Swivel, come down from aloft, we'll take in sail and come to an
                  anchor!"</p>
               <p>In a short time the square sails were clewed up and furled and the lower sails
                  hauled down.</p>
               <p>"Out boats!" cried Captain Dartmoor—"we've got to <emph>feel</emph> along that
                  shore!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>All</emph> the boats, sir?" asked the lieutenant.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and every man armed to the teeth. Leave only an anchor watch here—we may
                  want all our force if we find the fellow in there, as I expect in some creek or
                  bay where them high trees loom up!"</p>
               <p>"There's no creek there or on this shore, marked on our chart, sir. I know the
                  chart a heap better than I know my catechism!"</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6988-00000027"/>
               <p>"Yes, but the chart makers don't see everything as the gal with false hair and
                  porcelain teeth said after she'd roped a feller into the matrimonial yoke! We'll
                  go and have a look for the cove that carcass spoke of before he sucked his last
                  swallow of air. I'll take the gig, you follow in the first cutter, let the
                  boatswain take the other boat; see that all the men are well armed!"</p>
               <p>"Shall I take my little brass namesake in my boat, sir?"</p>
               <p>"You might as well, Mr. Swivel! Bear a hand, we've no time to lose!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, sir—I'll be ready in the shake of a sheep's tail!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>WHEN the grey dawn lightened up the darkness and made the fog-clouds visible, the
                  commander of the White Cruiser, in his frail boat, with his almost senseless
                  victim, was within a half mile of his vessel and of his secret hiding-place. As he
                  was close in shore, he thought he could get in unobserved by the cutter, for he
                  had seen her standing up the Sound long before, even at the first rising of the
                  morning star. But when he saw her haul up suddenly on the wind and head for him,
                  he knew that he was discovered.</p>
               <p>"Bend to your oars, my lads?" he cried to his men, "that cursed Custom House shark
                  has spied us!"</p>
               <p>The tearful eyes of the young girl brightened as she saw the white sails of the
                  vessel. He noticed the gleam of hope, and a dark smile, such an one as a human
                  fiend can give, passed over his face, while he whispered:</p>
               <p>"You need not think my dove, that yonder vulture can snatch you from my fond
                  embrace. You are mine, soul and body <emph>forever</emph> mine?"</p>
               <p>She <choice>
                     <sic>did did</sic>
                     <corr>did</corr>
                  </choice> not speak—she shuddered and breathed a silent prayer to the orphan's
                  FATHER.</p>
               <p>In a few moments the boat was at the month of the creek. As she shot in under the
                  shadow of the trees, the pirate bade his men ease their oars, that he might watch
                  the motions of the cutter. When he saw her clew up and take in her sails and come
                  to an anchor, then lower her boats, he muttered, "there is treachery—if either of
                  the cowardly dogs that were left wounded in their boats has lived, he has betrayed
                  me, Pull men, pull in now—if those boats pull into this creek their crews will be
                  hungry. I must go and get their breakfast ready. They'll never want another
                  meal!"</p>
               <p>In a short time he was alongside of his vessel. Rudolph was on deck, ready to
                  welcome him. Geronimo, the Italian boy, was there also, and his black eyes flashed
                  like lightning from a thunder-cloud, as they rested on the form of Ada, she who
                  had as he supposed, supplanted his mother in the heart of his master.</p>
               <p>Boldart, (we will drop Lord Platimere now, and use the legitimate name of our
                     <emph>hero</emph>, or <emph>villain</emph> if <emph>you</emph> think he
                  deserves the name, reader,) sprang on deck with Ada in his arms. Her he consigned
                  to the care of Geronimo, bidding him to take her to the luxuriant after cabin
                  which has already been described. Then turning to Rudolph, he said:</p>
               <p>"Have all hands on deck, we've work on hand! That cursed cutter has smelt us
                  out—her boats are coming in—we must be ready for them!"</p>
               <p>The face of Rudolph flushed rosily with pleasure. Like a gull that screams in its
                  wild joy and dips its wings in the spray when a storm is rising, he rejoiced at
                  the thought of battle.</p>
               <p>When Boldart saw his crew on deck, their cutlasses in hand, their loaded pistols
                  in their belts, that same dark smile passed over his face, which we have before
                  noticed and <choice>
                     <sic>descibed</sic>
                     <corr>described</corr>
                  </choice>. Some men when they are in their angriest mood, <emph>smile</emph>.
                  Beware of such, they are <emph>dangerous!</emph> Like the calm bosom of a
                  fathomless sea they conceal dangers<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6988-00000028"/> gers
                  which are the more terrible because they <emph>are</emph> hidden.</p>
               <p>"Rudolph, let the schooners bow swing out!" said Boldart, after he had inspected
                  the crew. "Let her bow swing out and bring her whole broadside to bear on the
                  channel. Mount all of our swivel guns on the rail and fill the long gun with
                  musket balls to the very muzzle. Those infernal fools have come for
                     <emph>something</emph>, and curse me if they shall be disappointed!"</p>
               <p>The orders were obeyed, the 'Cruiser' was soon ready for defence. Her commander
                  saw that all was right, then ordered his lightest boat with a picked crew to go to
                  the mouth of the creek to watch the motions of the cutter's boats and announce the
                  approach of danger. He then descended to the Cabin to look to the welfare of his
                  fair captive. He found her seated on the sofa near the after window, pale as a
                  lily on the lake, but as claim as that flower when not a breath ruffles the water.
                  Her calmness was that of despair. <emph>Poor girl</emph>, she only knew that she
                  was powerless—she thought that God had forsaken her!</p>
               <p>Boldart motioned to Geronimo and the boy left the cabin. But as he left, he cast
                  one look of bitter hatred on the girl. She saw it, like sharpened steel it entered
                  her very soul, she felt that she had <emph>no</emph> friends there, that she was
                  indeed alone and desolate in her wretchedness and she wept.</p>
               <p>Again the pirate smiled.</p>
               <p>"Weep on my fair-haired love!" he said, "It lighten's the cloud when the rain
                  falls—weep now, you'll laugh by and by, my child!"</p>
               <p>Indignation dried up the maiden's tears in a moment, for the wretch had placed his
                  arm around her slender waist. With her face crimsoned with shame, she strove to
                  release herself from his grasp, but strove in vain. His strong arm entwined her as
                  the anaconda entwines the feeble fawn.—She shrieked—but her shrieks were in vain.
                  That cabin had echoed helpless woman's shrieks before, and they had ever been
                  unheeded. The hot lips of the libertine pressed kiss after kiss upon her spotless
                  brow and cheeks. He clasped her wildly to his burning breast, wherein raged fires
                  all as fierce, and quenchless too, as those which flame eternally in Vesuvius—a
                  moment more and she had been lost—but a shot was heard, then a volley, and with a
                  shock like an earthquake the discharge of the heavy twenty-four pounder on deck,
                  told the pirate that he had no time for love's dalliance, that his foes were at
                  hand. Dropping the form of the frightened and nearly senseless girl, he rushed on
                  deck. Two of the cutter's boats were in sight, just at the bend of the cove,
                  splintered and shattered all to pieces. The few of their crew which yet survived
                  the fearful discharge, were struggling in the water.</p>
               <p>"Shoot them all—not a man must escape to carry news of our whereabouts!" cried the
                  pirate.</p>
               <p>"One boat has got off unhurt!" said Rudolph. "She was not fairly around the land
                  when we fired!"</p>
               <p>"Curse your carelessness—man my gig, we must capture them before they reach the
                  cutter. I will go myself—you see that the rascals in the water there are taken
                  care of!"</p>
               <p>His boat was manned in a moment and armed to the teeth, as were his crew, the
                  pirate sprang into her and shoved off. He pulled past the shattered boats, and as
                  he passed saw the upturned face of poor Dartmoor. He was dead. His left hand was
                  clutched to the gunwale of the boat, his right still held a cutlass in the
                  convulsive death-grasp, his weather-beaten face wore a look of determination which
                  said as plain as <emph>words</emph> could say, "<emph>I die doing my
                  duty</emph>."</p>
               <p>Boldart smiled—he passed the drowning wretches, unheeding their piteous cries for
                  aid. In a few minutes he was at the mouth of the creek. The other boat was full a
                  half mile in advance, pulling directly for the cutter.</p>
               <p>"Pull men—pull!" he cried." A thousand dollars amongst ye if we overhaul that boat
                  before she gets aboard!"</p>
               <p>The men strained every nerve—the ashen en oars quivered and cracked, the foam
                  rolled up in creamy flakes on either side of the sharp bows of the boat.</p>
               <p>"She gains at every lick, pull boys, <emph>pull</emph> if you love me—if you value
                  your lives!"</p>
               <p>The men did not speak, they had no breath to spare. The sweat rolled in huge drops
                  from their sun-browned faces—they shook their tarpaulin hats from their heads.
                  Every hair was wet with perspiration.</p>
               <p>The cutter lay at anchor full a mile and a half from shore, and now more than half
                  the distance was passed. The Cruiser's boat had gained rapidly, but the cutter's
                  men were straining every nerve also. Boldart's aim was to cut off the boat, gain
                  and carry the cutter, for he correctly conjectured that she had but three or four
                  men left on board—all the rest having been detailed for boat duty.</p>
               <p>Nearer and nearer the boats closed as they approached the schooner.</p>
               <p>"Pull, you devils, pull?" yelled Boldart.</p>
               <p>"Pull, sinners, pull, if you wan't to live to see York again!" cried Swivel, who
                  was in the cutter's boat.</p>
               <p>They were now within three or four hundred yards of the vessel. Swivel was not a
                  hundred yards ahead—suddenly a shot from the pursuing boat grazed his side and
                  pierced the after oarsman's heart. The lieutenant looked around and saw Boldart
                  hastily reloading the rifle which he had first discharged with such fatal
                  effect.</p>
               <p>"Give and take is all fair!" he cried as he raised a musket from the stern sheets,
                  aimed and fired.</p>
               <p>"You've got your dose!" he cried again, as he saw Boldart reel and fall back.</p>
               <p>The confusion on board of the pirates boat caused her to fall back for a moment,
                  but Boldart rose in an instant, and yelled—</p>
               <p>"To your oars boys, to your oars, he's only bored a hole in my shoulder, I'm not
                  hurt much!"</p>
               <p>But the Cutter's boat had gained the advantage, a minute more and her crew were on
                  board of their vessel.</p>
               <p>"Back round—we can't fight against grape and canister!" said Boldart, as he fairly
                  gnashed his teeth from pain and mortification, when he saw the Cutters crew
                  hurrying to get their long gun to bear on him. His crew now had indeed to pull for
                  life, for they had but too lately seen the effect of cannonry on the boats of
                  their enemies. But they were safe in shore before the weak-handed crew of the
                  Cutter could get their gun to bear on them.</p>
               <p>Swivel, seeing that they had escaped, hurried to get his cutter underway so as to
                  run down to the city for more assistance. Her jib and mainsail were up when
                  Boldart entered the creek.</p>
               <p>When he turned the bend, the remnants of the shattered boats met his eye, but not
                  a human form was in sight above the water. Again he <emph>smiled</emph>—and
                     <emph>such</emph> a smile! If a devil in hell never knew how to laugh, he
                  should have seen Boldart then and learned.</p>
               <p>"Rudolph—<emph>You've</emph> done well—but <emph>I</emph> have failed! Get ready
                  to make sail—I must leave these quarters, the Cutter is underway and bound for the
                  city. I must be ahead of her!"</p>
               <p>"The wind is freshening and nearly West, hadn't we better to go out through
                  Montauk, Sir?"</p>
               <p>"No—I'll heave a shot into that cursed cutter if I have to do it under the very
                  guns of the fort on Governor's Island D—m them I'll show them how to fool with
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"As you please Sir, but—</p>
               <p>"None of your buts, <emph>now</emph> Rudolph, I'm not in a good humor. Up boats,
                  set sail, and sweep the Schooner out of this hole at once!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, Sir!" In less time than it takes me to write these lines, the schooner
                  was under sail and moving out into the sound. As she drew out from the shore, she
                  felt the strength of the breeze and her wake whitened from the foam that her bows
                  dashed aside. The Cutter, not yet under full sail, for she was too weak-handed to
                  set all her canvas at once, was some seven or eight miles ahead.</p>
               <p>Boldart ordered every thread of sail set that his spars would bear for he knew
                     that<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6988-00000029"/> his safety depended on his
                  getting past the Navy-yard and forts in New York Bay before the alarm was given
                  and he hoped to overhaul the Cutter before she could alarm them. He intended to
                  carry her by boarding, for as he neared the city he knew it would not do to
                  attract observation by firing his cannon.</p>
               <p>With a full ten knot breeze, nearly abeam, both vessels rapidly neared Hurl Gate.
                  The Cruiser rapidly closed on the Cutter, and by the time they were at the upper
                  end of Randall's Island she was so near that the voices of her crew could be heard
                  on board.</p>
               <p>"You'd better heave too and let me go by, quietly?" cried Boldart.</p>
               <p>"I'll let you go to the devil as soon as you come alongside, Mister Platimere!"
                  said Swivel, standing aft with a lighted match in his hand. "Come up you
                  low-lived, thieving, murdering pirate, and exchange shots like a gentleman!"</p>
               <p>"I'm coming, keep cool!" said Boldart, and again he <emph>smiled</emph>. His crew
                  noted that smile—they knew that hell was hatching up a storm in <emph>his</emph>
                  heart when <emph>he</emph> so smiled.</p>
               <p>The vessels were now in the whirling tide of the Gate. The bow of the cruiser was
                  even with the stern of the cutter, another minute when they were both abreast of
                  Pot Rock, they were side by side.</p>
               <p>The long gun of the cruiser had been turned athwart-ship, its muzzle depressed—so
                  had Swivel prepared his pivot gun on the cutter. Standing, match in hand, as
                  coolly as if about to fire at a mark, for fun, he watched for the cruiser to come
                  up square, broadside on. She was there.</p>
               <p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p>
               <p>As he spoke the arm in which he held the match fell helpless to his side. The
                  report of a pistol told him whence it came. Another shot, and the helmsman fell
                  dead at the wheel. In a moment, missing the strong weather helm with which the man
                  had held her to her course, the cutter rounded to, and dashed bows on to the
                  rocks, staving in her head-timbers and pitching her spars out of her as if they
                  had been weak as pipe-stems. The crew had no time to fire guns then, their boats
                  alone could save them.</p>
               <p>The Cruiser fired no gun, her crew uttered no cheers, but they gazed with
                  admiration not unmixed with fear upon the man who had thus relieved them from
                  peril.</p>
               <p>She stood on down the Eastern channel. After she passed the upper end of
                  Blackwell's Island, Boldart descended into the cabin. Ada, in the same attitude of
                  despair, still sat there.</p>
               <p>"Look, my love," said the remorseless pirate, "first on these luxuries, and then
                  on that old rotten cottage on shore there, from whence I took you!"</p>
               <p>She looked whither he pointed—she saw the old willow tree—she thought of her
                  broken-hearted old grandmother.</p>
               <p>"Oh sir, if you are human—if you have a <emph>heart</emph>, oh if you have a
                  mother, a <emph>sister</emph>, pity and release me!" she moaned. "Set me on
                  shore—night and morning will I kneel and pray to God to bless you!"</p>
               <p>"A <emph>mother</emph>—a sister!" he said, and a shade of feeling darkened his
                  face. "I've been told I had both, but I never knew them!"</p>
               <p>"Oh release me, I'll be a <emph>sister</emph> to you—oh <emph>do</emph>, for the
                  love of heaven, do!"</p>
               <p>"A sister? Ha! ha! you're nearer than that my love, you're my
                     <emph>betrothed</emph>, d'ye hear? My betrothed, and ere this night yields its
                  gloomy sceptre to the burnished hand of to-morrow's dawn you shall be my
                  bride!"</p>
               <p>"Your bride, monster, you do not mean that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, terrified angel, the <emph>monster</emph> means just that! You needn't
                  shudder and tremble, fairer women than you are have sighed in vain to occupy your
                  position. You should be proud of your place—I, an OCEAN KING, am your slave;
                     <emph>dear</emph> Ada, I <emph>love</emph> you!"</p>
               <p>He kissed her as he spoke. It had been better for him had he not, for with a blow
                  stronger than it would seem possible she could give, she struck him on his
                  bandaged shoulder and sent him reeling across the cabin. But, woman-like, as she
                  saw the blood gush from the freshly opened wound, she fainted. When she recovered
                  she was alone.</p>
               <p>Boldart after his repulse went into the forward cabin and Geronimo dressed his
                  wounds, for the boy, young as he was, was quite skillful in surgery. No wonder—he
                  had been born and reared amid scenes of strife—had seen blood flow like the
                  streams on a hill-side after a rain had fallen. He could see steel flash without
                  blinking, hear groans and think them musical, and gaze on innocence like poor Ada
                  and study how to murder her without his master's knowledge. Yet, withal, the boy
                  had one good trait. He <emph>loved</emph> his mother. For her he was ready to
                  commit any crime. He respected his master only because his mother loved him. And
                  the boy knew that his mother's love was so fervent that she could endure no rival,
                  therefore he studied how it was best to destroy that rival before his mother
                  should see her.</p>
               <p>The vessel was now opposite the Wallabout. Many eyes from the Navy Yard, eyes of
                  old experienced seamen, (none of your fresh-water, centre-board crabs,) were cast
                  admiringly upon her, as taunt-rigged, under all her muslin, she swept down the
                  channel. Again she had the English flag flying, but a blind man
                     <emph>hearing</emph> her rush through the water, would have sworn that she was
                  American built.</p>
               <p>"Are you going to stop, sir?" asked Rudolph, as he heard Boldart direct the man at
                  the helm to luff her in toward the Battery.</p>
               <p>"Yes sir—I'm going ashore—what is it your business?" replied Boldart angrily.</p>
               <p>"It is not my business, perhaps, Captain, but answer me one question?"</p>
               <p>"Well, what is it?"</p>
               <p>"Have I not ever been and <emph>proved</emph> a true, faithful follower of yours?
                  Have you not promoted me as your first officer for my conduct?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Rudolph, I have. I've been wrong—I insulted you, I had no cause—forgive
                  me—I'm full of trouble to-day. I want to get old Whitelead's treasure ashore if I
                  can. Bear with my anger, <emph>folly</emph> I may call it, Rudolph."</p>
               <p>"Captain I'm yours forever—death alone can sever us!"</p>
               <p>"Stand by to take in sail, my boy, we'll anchor here!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye Sir! All hands tend tackles and sheets, man clewlines and buntline's
                  forward—lookout for the starboard anchor there!"</p>
               <p>In a few moments the Cruiser lay as quiet at her anchor as a sharp-nosed baby on a
                  cross woman's bosom, that like the bag only needed a "bit of a breeze" to wake it
                  up."</p>
               <p>A boat was lowered and Boldart, once more Lord Platimere, pulled ashore and landed
                  at Rabineau's steps. As he was going up the avenue leading toward Broadway, he saw
                  two persons advancing. With <emph>both</emph> he had a slight acquaintance. One
                  was young, fair and smiling. The other was oldish—he looked pale and
                  nervous.—Reader, to save you the trouble of guessing, I'll inform you that they
                  were Mr. Whitelead and his daughter.</p>
               <p>"Well—well a pretty muss your <choice>
                     <sic>yacthing</sic>
                     <corr>yachting</corr>
                  </choice> and playing the <emph>English Lord</emph>, has got you in! A revenue
                  cutter chased you cut of here, didn't she?" said the old
                  <emph>gentleman</emph>.</p>
               <p>"She'll never chase me again!" said Boldart, with his peculiar smile.</p>
               <p>"You've sunk her, <emph>haven't</emph> yon Captain?" asked the lady.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>expect</emph> she's under water, lady!" said the Captain, bowing low.</p>
               <p>"I told you so, pa. I told you he was never to be taken alive!" she cried. And
                  then she added—"Captain, how delighted I should be to take a cruise with you—wont
                  you take me along?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps at another time—I am not now prepared to extend to you the luxurious
                  comforts that a lady of your taste and position would desire."</p>
               <p>"Another time may never come—I want to go <emph>now!</emph>" she said pettishly.
                  "I care not for comforts—I wish I was a man I'd<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC6988-00000030"/> scorn comfort, defy the world and live just as I
                  pleased!"</p>
               <p>"You live <emph>now</emph>, pretty much as you please, but that isn't here nor
                  there! Boldart, how will we get the treasure <choice>
                     <sic>aahore</sic>
                     <corr>ashore</corr>
                  </choice>!"</p>
               <p>"Land it—my boats can do it in ten minutes."</p>
               <p>"But we cannot do that in the light of open day. Your vessel is now
                  suspected!"</p>
               <p>"Well, that is true, suppose I run down and go outside as if I was going to sea,
                  come back after dark and run up to the nook just this side of Burnham's. You have
                  a conveyance ready—all will be safe!"</p>
               <p>"You are right. That is the best place—I'll be there, get underway as soon as you
                  can, and attract as little notice as possible! Come daughter, let us go home!"</p>
               <p>"I'm going to take a sail with Captain Boldart, father!"</p>
               <p>"Mary—<emph>Mary</emph> what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Just what I say father! He is only going outside till evening. I can come back.—I
                  cannot flatter myself with the hope that he'll think me worth running away
                  with!"</p>
               <p>"Kind Lady, I acknowledge I am not hold enough to lift my eyes towards so bright a
                  star in the sky of beauty!"</p>
               <p>"Not even when it sheds all its light upon <emph>you</emph>. Captain?"</p>
               <p>"Lady feeling all too powerful the potency of that light. I dread its strength, I
                  must go!"</p>
               <p>"And I go with you no excuse, no getting out of it, woman will have her own
                  way!"</p>
               <p>So saying the lady stepped into Boldart's boat. He, hurried as he was, could do
                  nothing else than to follow her and order his men to row on board.</p>
               <p>"The devil is in that girl she'll be the ruin of me yet!" muttered Whitelead as he
                  saw the boat recede from the shore</p>
               <p>He turned away, to prepare for receiving his treasure that night. As he did so he
                  was met face to face by the same whiteheaded man who has been already described as
                  THE FIRST RELATIVE in the opening of the first chapter.</p>
               <p>Get out of my way, beggar, I've no money for such as you!" said the
                  millionaire.</p>
               <p>"James Whitelead, I don't cross your way for <emph>money!</emph> It is twenty
                  years, or nigh to it, since I laid my eyes on you, but I knew you in a moment. I
                  don't want money—I want to know where my wife and my children are. You seduced her
                  from me—you robbed me—it is <emph>my</emph> wealth you are revelling in—you are
                  welcome to <emph>that</emph>, but tell me for God's sake where my wife and
                  Children are!"</p>
               <p>"Get out of my way. I don't know you, you shrivelled old idiot!" said Whitelead,
                  spurning him aside.</p>
               <p>The old man staggered from the push, but in a moment he recovered himself. "Go on
                  James," he said, "go on, my <emph>limbs</emph> are feeble, but my heart is strong,
                  and I will follow you—go on—go on, I am coming!"</p>
               <p>And he followed him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>BOLDART had been but a few moments on the vessel's deck before his obedient crew
                  had run up the anchor and stretched every stitch of canvas. that spar or yard
                  could spread. While he gave his rapid orders, Mary Whitelead gazed in pleased
                  astonishment upon their rapid execution. When she saw the vessel rush down through
                  the tide which was on its flood, heard the dash of waves forward, and saw the
                  snowy foam trailing like bridal robes abaft, she was delighted.</p>
               <p>"This is beautiful, it is glorious!" she cried. "Captain, I came aboard for a
                  short trip—it will be your <emph>own</emph> fault if it be not a long one! I like
                  you—I <emph>may</emph> love you, if I do, mine will not be a short-lived love. I
                  know I am bold in thus speaking, indelicate, some would say,
                     <emph>unwomanly</emph>, but I assert that I am <emph>all</emph>-womanly. When a
                     <emph>true</emph> woman loves, she knows nothing but her love, sacrifices all,
                  dares all for love!—Such I am, as such receive me!"</p>
               <p>"But, lady—"</p>
               <p>"What, sir, am I scorned?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, lady, not scorned; you are <emph>admired</emph>, you are respected—"</p>
               <p>"RESPECTED—ADMIRED! What do I care for respect or admiration, fools tributes are
                  they. I want <emph>love</emph>—LOVE?"</p>
               <p>"Lady, I would I could give you love—but there is another female on board of this
                  vessel!"</p>
               <p>"Ha! Your wife? Are you married?"</p>
               <p>"No, lady, I am not, and she of whom you speak hates and detests me!"</p>
               <p>"I'm glad of that. Will you let me see her?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you will do her no harm and will try to soften her heart!"</p>
               <p>"Soften <emph>her</emph> heart? Yes, I'll try to lend me to her?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot leave the deck just now sweet lady—but my page will serve. Here,
                  Geronimo!"</p>
               <p>The boy came.</p>
               <p>"Take this lady down and introduce her to Miss Ada."</p>
               <p>The Italian boy bowed low in obeisance and descended to the cabin. The lady
                  followed.</p>
               <p>An hour elapsed before Mary Whitelead reappeared on deck. Boldart had been busy
                  piloting his vessel down the bay, for he knew every foot of ground, every
                  sand-bank, oyster-bed and rock in it, and now they had cleared the Southwest bank
                  and were heading for Gedney's channel. He was busy looking at the compass and
                  noticing his landmarks, when a light hand was laid on his shoulder. That hand
                  belonged to Miss Mary Whitelead. He turned and her smiling face was before
                  him.</p>
               <p>"I've been down to see your sensitive flower, Captain," she said, "I tried to
                  comfort her but I wasted my words. Like David when Absolom was slain, she weeps
                  and will not be comforted!"</p>
               <p>"She needs rougher wooing than thine, lady!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she does, but she is a poor ignorant thing, why not set her on shore?
                     <emph>She</emph> does not love you, <emph>I do!</emph> Cast her off and accept
                  what I offer, the love not of a girl in her teens, but that of a
                     <emph>woman!</emph> Boldart, I admired you first, I <emph>love</emph> you now.
                  I have wealth, men <emph>say</emph> I am beautiful! My wealth, my heart, is all
                  your own—I<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6988-00000031"/> love you, take me now, take me
                     <emph>forever</emph>!"</p>
               <p>All unmindful that the gaze of the crew was upon her, the impulsive, passionate
                  woman threw her arms around his neck and placed kiss after kiss upon his lips.</p>
               <p>He coldly pushed her back, saying—"It is no use to carry on, Miss Whitelead, I
                  love Ada!"</p>
               <p>She did not weep, she uttered no curse—like a statue of ice, snow-white and cold,
                  she turned away. But where her pearly teeth met on her lip a crimson stream arose
                  and flowed down upon her neck.</p>
               <p>"Both of you shall perish?" she whispered to herself— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Better meet a devil born</l>

               </p>
               <p>She sat down on the taffrail and took a roll of paper from her pocket. It was a
                  dingy, ancient looking roll, and the perusal of it seemed to afford her intense
                  satisfaction, for ever and anon as she read it her features would lighten up and
                  she would laugh wildly and strange.</p>
               <p>"I have the thread of <emph>his</emph> history," she would mutter, "and with it I
                  will strangle all his hopes of bliss?"</p>
               <p>He heard her: "The thread of <emph>my</emph> history," he thought. "Is it
                  contained in those papers?"</p>
               <p>All too truly it was. He, though apparently busy in attending to his vessel

                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> repeatedly passing close by her, tried to read the manuscript which she
                  held in her hands. She noticed this.</p>
               <p>"You'd like to read this, would you not!" he said with a malicious smile.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, lady, it concerns me not!" he plied.</p>
               <p>"So far as <emph>you</emph> know, now," she answered. "Yet," she continued, "it
                     <emph>might</emph> concern you. It is an old paper that I picked up in one of
                  the old drawers of my father's desk. It is quite amusing to me, for it shows what
                  told rascal my <emph>good</emph> father is. It is quite a romance—it is not
                  exactly an auto-biography—nor is it a death-bed confession, yet it relates the
                  particulars of a case where a fair woman was led astray, where her husband
                  misinformed as to her frailty and its causes, became a drunken sot, a beggar, and
                  at last the inmate of a prison; her son a waif on the world's wide sea, was reared
                  a smuggler and became a pirate, her daughter who was his sister—"</p>
               <p>"Woman, <emph>woman</emph>, what was this man's name? Let me see that paper!" he
                  cried.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Never</emph>!" she replied as she dashed the manuscript overboard. "I know
                  the names—they are buried in my bosom, whence <emph>you</emph> cannot rend them.
                  You, Albert Quimby, are the boy who was reared a smuggler, who <emph>are</emph> a

               <p>"My mother and sister, where are they?"</p>
               <p>"One is in the grave. Your sister, a fair, lovely girl, as ever the sun shone upon
                  is now helpless and in a villain's power, one who seared in heart and callous to
                  her tears, will soon triumph over all that is left to her worth living for—her yet
                  untarnished innocence!"</p>
               <p>"My God, Mary Whitelead, is this true?"</p>
               <p>"As true as I live—as true as the gospel of Christ—as true as that I but a short
                  time since forgot all my womanhood and wildly confessed a love which then was as
                  fervent as my hate <emph>now</emph> is for you!"</p>
               <p>"Tell me where my sister is—I will go back to see her. <emph>All</emph> humanity
                  has not vanished from my bosom?"</p>
               <p>"You have driven it from mine, Albert!" she said.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Albert!</emph>" That <emph>is</emph> my name. I can faintly remember a
                  gentle being, who used to call me by that name, when I was a boy. And a little
                  sunny-haired, blue-eyed sister,—my God where is she now?" he moaned.</p>
               <p>"In the power of a heartless libertine!" said the female fiend, who at last had
                  learned how to torture him.</p>
               <p>"Woman, do not drive me mad, or so help me God I'll feed the sharks on your
                  body!"</p>
               <p>"If you do I'll not be the first woman that you've murdered, I suppose, and when I
                  die your secret dies with me!"</p>
               <p>"No, your cursed old father knows it all, and I'll wring it from his heart if I
                  have to rend his flesh from his bones by inches!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he knows a part of the secret—I'll tell you all he knows—he seduced your
                  mother by <emph>lies</emph>, not by gold, for her virtue could not be bought; by
                     <emph>lies</emph> he seduced her away from your father. He saw her die and
                  refused to <emph>bury</emph> her. She is buried in the Potter's field amongst the
                  rotting bodies of <emph>other</emph> paupers. He, through agents, drove your
                  father to despair, to drunkenness and misery, at last to a prison. He reared you
                  up in crime; knows who and what you are. But there is one secret he does not know,
                  which I have found out. He does not know where your <emph>sister</emph> is;
                     <emph>I do!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"For God's sake tell me!"</p>
               <p>"I will when I am in the humor and after she has been robbed of her purity. Oh,
                  how beautiful she is—fit to be the bride of a King, pure now as an angel, but soon
                  she will be a thing of shame!"</p>
               <p>"Woman—woman, no, <emph>fiend</emph>, that you are, for Heaven's sake stop! Here,
                  Geronimo, bring me some wine to quench the infernal fire that is burning my very
                  heart up!"</p>
               <p>The boy brought him a golden goblet filled to the brim with sparkling wine. At a
                  draught he drained it.</p>
               <p>"More—more!" he cried.</p>
               <p>"Go on!" cried the woman—"go on, get up your steam. you fool, then you can explode
                  the easier!"</p>
               <p>She laughed wildly as she saw his face flush with the wine.</p>
               <p>It was now near night. The vessel had gained an offing, and ordering her to be
                  hove too, ready to return to the harbor to land his treasure, Boldart went below.
                  Geronimo was in the forward cabin, calling the boy to him, he ordered him not to
                  permit any one, especially the woman on deck, to enter the after cabin. Then,
                  after drinking another goblet of wine, he entered the saloon wherein his helpless,
                  wretched victim was still seated, almost in a state of torpor, like a statue of
                  despairing innocence.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>WHEN Whitelead passed up from the Battery, the old man whom we may as well now
                  designate by his name, Braham Quimby, followed closely on his foot-steps. Though
                  his form was wasted by age, suffering and disease, he stepped vigorously along,
                  for his wrongs and injuries were rankling in his heart and he had determined upon
                  seeking and having satisfaction. People did not notice him, for in Gotham the
                  beggar and the dandy often walk side by side, and <emph>sometimes</emph> the
                  beggar has the most money of the two in his pocket. But had any one noticed the
                  fire which flashed in that old man's eye—seen how his gloomy, wrinkled brow
                  lowered like a cloud over those eyes, he might have judged that a pent-up storm
                  was cloaked within his breast.</p>
               <p>Up Broadway they went, the millionaire neither pausing or looking to the right or
                  the left, until he came to Barium's Museum, where the great
                     <emph>Temperance</emph> reformer keeps his shaving shop, and under which
                  Whitelead stopped to take a little brandy and water to wash the dust out of his
                  throat. The old man, like a sleuth hound on the track, followed and watched his
                  every motion. He did not drink—he had a good reason for not doing so, he hadn't
                  the <emph>tin</emph> to pay for it, nor the <emph>brass</emph> to go on "tick,"
                  like some of the penny-a-line authors about Gotham who live on their reputation as
                  "members of the Press."</p>
               <p>Whitelead, after relaxing into a <emph>smile spiritual</emph>, again passed up
                  Broadway. He looked several times at the omnibuses, but he couldn't afford to
                  spend <emph>another</emph> sixpence so soon and he walked on. When he got up by
                  the City Hospital, he was interrupted by a large crowd which surrounded a man, who
                  shattered and bleeding, was being carried into the hospital. "What is the matter?"
                  he asked, "what is the crowd blocking up the street for?"</p>
               <p>"A poor man has just fallen from the scaffolding of a house. They say he'll
                  die—that is his wife that is crying there—he has a large family!"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw,—what a fuss they make over a poor devil of a <emph>mechanic!</emph>" said
                  the millionaire, as he elbowed his way through the crowd. "If I was to drop down
                  in an <choice>
                     <sic>appoplectic</sic>
                     <corr>apoplectic</corr>
                  </choice> fit, or die suddenly, they wouldn't do more for me than they're doing
                  for him and I'm a <emph>gentleman!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Whitelead forgot just then that he owed his rise in life to his association with a
                     <emph>hogthief</emph>, (his <emph>partnership</emph> I should say)—that all of
                  his immense wealth had been gained by a steady and systematic course of crime. How
                  many rich, <emph>respectable</emph> thieves live in our city! Sing Sing can't turn
                  out of her granite walls to-day one half as many thieves as I can find in an hour
                  in Wall street, and seize the inmates of every brothel in town, face them in line,
                  and count them all, and I can outnumber them by counting the respectable
                  courtezans, "<emph>ladies</emph>" who, in a single afternoon visit one or two
                  fashionable, Broadway Ice Cream Saloons.</p>
               <p>This is <emph>plain</emph> talk, but it is TRUE!</p>
               <p>Yes, poverty and wretchedness, are it is true, confined to the lower classes in
                  our city in the greatest degree, but gilded crime upheld by ill-gotten wealth
                  revels in our palaces. A starving sewing girl may lose her virtue, then she is
                  criminal—her path leads only to prison and ends at the Potter' Field—a woman of
                  wealth and station may sin and sin again, and the editor who would dare to say
                  that her's was a crime—that she was more venial than the poor girl, would be
                  likely to be sent to jail for a libel and have to endure the indignation of the
                  respectable, no, the <emph>aristocratic</emph> portion of community.</p>
               <p>If an old man shivering in his rags during the pitiless height of a wild wintery
                  storm should snatch a garment from the walls of a Chatham street Judas who lives
                  by cheating poor sewing girls, he would be hurried unheard to the gloomy cell of a
                  prison; but if a clerk of <emph>good family</emph>, steals fifteen or twenty
                  thousand dollars from his employers or a Beach robs by illegal banking ten
                  thousand mechanics and workers, of their little savings, or a Barnum by
                     <emph>false pretences</emph> with a Feejee mermaid or a woolly horse gulls the
                  people out of their money, or a Hayeman runs off with the deposits of a bank, or a
                  Restell murders babes for a trade, they commit no crime—their gold is an
                  endorsement for their purity, their virtue, their <emph>honor</emph>!</p>
               <p>I verily believe that if Christ descended into this city in <emph>his</emph> holy
                  purity, and came as he bade <emph>his</emph> apostles go forth, poor,
                     <emph>christians</emph> would let him starve to death at the porch of Trinity
                  Church.</p>
               <p>Think me not irreverant, think not that I despise christianity, I respect it as it
                  is <emph>taught</emph> in the bible, not as it is <emph>practised</emph> in this
                  city where the church spires almost touch the skies and where the followers of the
                  humble Saviour, his pastors ride in blazoned coaches, and kneel down on velvet
                  cushions to utter lip-prayers never born in the heart.</p>
               <p>If they but did their duty; if our judges and officers of the law did theirs, if
                  true charity existed here, our papers would not daily be filled with a melancholy
                  record of crimes, of mysterious murders, of unhappy suicides, oh, let the
                     <emph>few</emph> philanthropists in our midst endeavor to alter this state of
                  things.</p>
               <p>But I forgot; I am <emph>only</emph> writing a <emph>novel</emph> and it will not
                  do for me to <emph>moralise</emph> or step aside from the thread of my story.</p>
               <p>After passing the crowd in front of the city Hospital, Mr. Whitelead passed
                  leisurely along up Broadway, looking often with a licentious leer into the faces
                  of the females whom he met, but never thinking to look back where the old man was
                  steadily following him. On up the street toward the marble walls of Grace Church,
                  passing the magnificent hotels and palaces of our "Merchant princes" he passed and
                  silently his pursuer followed. Arriving at Union Square he turned to the left and
                  soon reached a splendid mansion. Its carved pillars, steps of marble, and costly
                  ornaments bespoke the wealth of its owner. Into this house Whitelead entered. The
                  old man sat down on the steps.</p>
               <p>"Whitelead—Whitelead, we must have a reckoning this night he muttered. The author
                  of all my wrongs and wretchedness, my ruiner—he whom God will <emph>not</emph>
                  punish, I <emph>must</emph>."</p>
               <p>And night came on. Still the old man sat there. A policeman with the burnished
                  star of office on his breast came up.</p>
               <p>"What are ye doin' here ould man in yer rags, on a rich man's door steps!" he
                  asked in Hibernian accents. "Why the devil don't ye go home when ye may be afther
                  catching a bloody thafe of a could that 'll stale the little life that's left in
                  ye?"</p>
               <p>"I have no home!" said the old man.</p>
               <p>"Then its a vagrant ye are, and to the Island or Asylum ye ought to go!"</p>
               <p>"The man that lives in this house robbed me of a fortune!"</p>
               <p>"The devil he did. And why didn't ye complain to the police and have him tuk up,
                  thin?"</p>
               <p>"Who would arrest a rich man upon the complaint of a poor one in New York?"</p>
               <p>"Be jabars, nobody, and if he did he'd be bloody grane. It's meself knows the
                  custom of the place better. But you'd be better be movin' on—if the master within
                  wur to come out he'd be after kicking up a hullabaloo with me and report me to the
                  Captain for letting a beggar sit on his door steps.</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6988-00000033"/>
               <p>"I am tired!"</p>
               <p>"Sure and I can't help that—its yer own fault, you've no business to thravel till
                  you're tired!"</p>
               <p>At this moment the door opened and old Whitelead, enveloped in a cloak, as if
                  prepared for a night-walk appeared.</p>
               <p>"Move offo the steps ye auld thafe of a beggar, didn't I tell ye the master would
                  come!" cried the policeman angrily, seizing the old man by the shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Don't use me roughly, I'm ready to go on now. I'm not tired now!" said the old
                  man.</p>
               <p>Whitelead passed by without seeming to notice them. The old man followed him. The
                  policeman turned on his heel and passed down his beat, whistling "Erin go
                  bragh."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>WHEN Lieutenant Swivel and his crew arrived in their boats from the wreck of the
                  cutter, and reported the daring outrage of the Smuggler or Pirate, it created a
                  tremendous excitement in the city.</p>
               <p>The commandant of the Navy Yard, upon a requisition, or rather a
                     <emph>request</emph>, from the Port Collector, at once issued orders to a
                  surveying schooner and a steamer under his charge, to get under way and pursue the
                  vessel, and also sent a detachment of boats out to look for the villain if his
                  vessel was still in the harbor, manning the boats, in addition to their crews,
                  with a strong party of marines.</p>
               <p>Of course, considerable time elapsed before the cutter's crew reached the city,
                  and it was nearly or quite nightfall before the parties were afloat on their
                  perilous duty.</p>
               <p>We will now return to the White Cruiser, where we left her in the sixteenth
                  chapter, hove too ready to return to the city. Boldart had entered the cabin where
                  poor Ada sat so helplessly, his brain inflamed with wine, his heart full of lust,
                  his blood rushing madly through its heated veins. But when he saw her sit so pale,
                  so motionless, the little of manhood that there was in his heart returned to him,
                  perhaps <emph>her</emph> better angel whispered to him, for they say that all
                  unseen the spirits of Heaven hover near us—and he muttered—"you can rest in safety
                  till to-morrow, I've work enough for to-night!"</p>
               <p>Then he turned away and left her.</p>
               <p>With eyes upturned toward heaven, she uttered a prayer of hope and an expression
                  of thankfulness for her momentary relief from a fate more dreadful to her than
                  death.</p>
               <p>When he returned to the deck, he was again met by his incarnate and fiendish
                  tormentor, Mary Whitelead.</p>
               <p>"Ho, my brave Captain—so soon returned from your beautiful prize?" she sneeringly
                  cried." I heard no shriek—no cry of <emph>her</emph> distress, no shout of
                     <emph>your</emph> triumph. Is it possible that the <emph>brave</emph> buccaneer
                  has relented, that he has reformed and is now going to be a second
                     <emph>Joseph</emph>?" Boldart passed her without heeding her and approached his
                  lieutenant.</p>
               <p>"Set all sail—we will back to the city, land our treasure and then head for blue
                  water and curse me if I ever return into this infernal hole!"</p>
               <p>"You'll never leave it alive if there is rope enough in New York to hang you!"
                  muttered the woman—"you'll wish you had not scorned <emph>me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>All sail was crowded on the craft and soon she was heading up the bay again.</p>
               <p>"Keep a look out, a bright one too for strange craft, that cutter's crew may have
                  raised the town ere this!" said Boldart. "Aye—aye Sir!" was the ready reply of
                  Rudolph.</p>
               <p>The Captain now seated himself on a coil of rope near the mainmast and with his
                  head bound forward, his face covered by his hands seemed lost in gloomy
                  thought.</p>
               <p>Mean-time the lady paced to and fro upon deck, the darkness shadowing the
                  expression of passion which distorted her beautiful face. When near the taffrail a
                  light hand was laid upon her rounded arm. She turned haughtily to confront the
                  intruder, but by<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6988-00000034"/> the dim light reflected
                  from the binnacle she saw that it was only the boy Geronimo.</p>
               <p>Motioning her to follow to a darker side of the vessel, he there paused and in a
                  low voice whispered,</p>
               <p>"Lady you hate the girl that the Captain has below in the cabin?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Yes!</emph> why do ask?"</p>
               <p>"Because I <emph>hate</emph> her, too! Hate her as only an Italian can hate
                  her!"</p>
               <p>"Why, she never has harmed you!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—she has robbed my mother!"</p>
               <p>"Robbed your mother? What do you mean? Who is your mother?"</p>
               <p>"A woman, like yourself, lady—a proud, beautiful woman, who will brook no rival in
                  my master's love, who would die if she knew that another had usurped her home in
                  his heart!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, is it so? Where is your mother, my pretty boy?"</p>
               <p>"In our sweet Island home—far, far from here, in a land where the trees are
                  forever green, the flowers ever in blossom; where the myrtle twines with the rose,
                  where the orange glows like gold, the sands are white as snow, where all is
                  beautiful!"</p>
               <p>"Why what a poet you are—you will make me love the place—would you like me to go
                  there?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, lady!"</p>
               <p>"Why, my pretty boy?"</p>
               <p>"Because my master does <emph>not</emph> love you!"</p>
               <p>"You are observing, for your age, young sir!"</p>
               <p>"But there are brave, handsome cavaliers there who will, lady—you are
                     <emph>very</emph> handsome!"</p>
               <p>"So young and can flatter?"</p>
               <p>"It is not flattery; but I like you, lady, because you hate <emph>her!</emph> Why
                  do you not kill her?"</p>
               <p>"Kill her—why you little savage, how cruel you are. Your master will break her
                  heart!"</p>
               <p>"No, lady—he will spare her because he <emph>loves</emph> her—he did love my
                  mother and he spared her until she loved him. I watched his motions to-night. I
                  saw that he pitied <emph>her</emph>. She must die!"</p>
               <p>"Sail ho!" cried a lookout forward.</p>
               <p>The Captain sprang to his feet.</p>
               <p>"Geronimo, bring up my night telescope!" he cried.</p>
               <p>In a moment it was brought.</p>
               <p>"Where is she?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"Close aboard, Sir, on the starboard bow!" replied the look-out.</p>
               <p>"A man of war schooner, by Jove" he muttered, as he scanned the stranger through
                  his glass.</p>
               <p>"There seems to be a steamer away in shore toward the Long-Island side!" said
                  Rudolph.</p>
               <p>"Aye! You are right, I see her—douse every light, we must slip by them if we
                  can—if it is as I fear we'll have to fight if we can't pass them unseen!"</p>
               <p>"It is too late, Sir, see the schooner is luffing up across our bow!"</p>
               <p>"So she is, but I may fool her yet, and I don't care if she does not alarm the
                  steamer and get her after us too. Steam beats canvas in waters as smooth as
                  these!"</p>
               <p>"Schooner ahoy! What schooner is that?" cried a clear voice from the United States
                  vessel.</p>
               <p>"The Bonita, from Havana, with a load of fruit!" replied Boldart.</p>
               <p>"Heave too, I wish to send a boat <choice>
                     <sic>aboad</sic>
                     <corr>aboard</corr>
                  </choice> of you, Sir!"</p>
               <p>"What did you say, Sir, I didn't understand you?" cried Boldart, as his vessel
                  swept swiftly past the other.</p>
               <p>"Heave too—D—m you, heave too!—This is the United States schooner Boxer!"</p>
               <p>The commander of the White Cruiser pretended not to hear the order and kept on.
                  The schooner was immediately hove about, but before she was in the Cruiser's wake,
                  the latter was nearly two miles in her lead.</p>
               <p>Boldart watched her with an anxious eye, but when he saw rockets raised from the
                  schooner to signal the steamer, and heard the boom of a heavy gun, fired to
                  attract her attention, he muttered a bitter curse.</p>
               <p>"Fate and the devil are both against us!" he cried. "Rudolph—we cannot land," he
                  cried, "we must run our chances through the Sound again!"</p>
               <p>"There are boats, full of men, sir, pulling out of the East River towards us!"
                  replied the young officer, who was looking in that direction through his
                  glass.</p>
               <p>"So there are—by Jove we are hemmed in but there is no use in giving up while
                  there is a shot in the locker, a spar standing, or a plank between us and the
                  bottom!"</p>
               <p>"No sir, but what shall we do—our escape is cut off!"</p>
               <p>"Not yet, we can run up the North River as old Kidd did, and if we can't save our
                  treasure we can sink the craft and scatter ourselves safely from pursuit in the
                  country. Perhaps we can fool them in the darkness, for it is going to be a dark as
                  well as a stormy night, and slip out by them!"</p>
               <p>"I would hope so, but those Navy boys when once waked up don't keep a lubberly
                  watch—they are keen on the scent and bright on the look-out."</p>
               <p>"That is so, but see that every light is out. Keep the schooner well in under the
                  shadow of the land; if possible I'll stop and see old Whitelead—we are full three
                  miles ahead of the schooner now, and will gain every minute. I want to land his
                  fiend of a daughter—where is she? she was here on deck but now!"</p>
               <p>"Gone below, I suppose, she's a bitter thing, handsome but devilish!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, altogether too much so for my use. I wish she had never bothered me with her
                  presence or her unasked love!"</p>
               <p>Little did Boldart dream that at that very moment she was below holding a light at
                  the window in the after-cabin to guide his foes in the pursuit.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <p>MR. WHITELEAD after leaving his house proceeded to a stable near, where he asked a
                  man in attendance if Jack Carbuncle was there.</p>
               <p>"He's aslape up in the hayloft, sir, I believe Sir. He came in an hour or two ago
                  a little heavy by the head and is slaping it off!"</p>
               <p>"Call him—I want him and his carriage immediately!"</p>
               <p>"I'll call him Sir, but I'm afraid he's snoring so loud that he'll not hear
                  me!—What'll I do wid the baste thin!"</p>
               <p>"Kick him till he wakes—come I'm in a hurry!"</p>
               <p>While the man went to arouse the hackman, Whitelead paced nervously to and fro on
                  the pavement in front of the stable. In the shadow of an opposite house stood the
                  old man watching his every motion.</p>
               <p>In a short time a fellow whose close cut hair, rummy face and b'hoy rig betokened
                  him to be of that class of curses to the city known as baggage smashers and
                  wharf-hackmen, many of whom are professional thieves and others are only pimps to
                  the most notorious of our brothels, or partners with the thimble riggers and Peter
                  Funks, came out cursing and grumbling at the Irishman who had awakened him.</p>
               <p>"Where is the covey that wants, me—<emph>sa-ay?</emph>" he said.</p>
               <p>"Here Jack, hitch up quick, I've work for you to-night!" said Whitelead.</p>
               <p>"Oh it's <emph>you</emph>, is it boss—and you want the team? How far are we to
                  go?"</p>
               <p>"Only two or three miles, hurry!"</p>
               <p>"Well if its no furder than that, I'm <emph>in,</emph> but I'm tired, so's my
                  osses—I've had too musses to day and I've drove the team hard too!"</p>
               <p>In a short time a team full as hard looking as the driver was hitched to a
                  carriage and Whitelead got in. After giving his directions to his driver, the
                  carriage drove off up town. At the same moment the old man emerged from his shaded
                  place of concealment and running across the <choice>
                     <sic>streat</sic>
                     <corr>street</corr>
                  </choice> leaped nimbly up on the foot board behind the coach and there took his
                  seat, neither the driver or his passenger observed this and the coach was driven
                  rapidly up into the North Western and thinly populated part of the city.</p>
               <p>When it was up in the lower part of the Bloomingdale district, it turned off into
                  a narrow lane which led directly down to the shore of the North River. Arriving at
                  the bank at a place where the shore was indented by a little cove or nook, it
                  stopped under the dense shadow of some old trees, and Whitelead got out.</p>
               <p>The old man slipped from his seat and hid behind the trunk of one of the
                  trees.</p>
               <p>"Will we stay long here, Boss?" asked the driver.</p>
               <p>"Till a vessel comes which will land something for me. We must keep a lookout for
                  her and her boats!" replied Whitelead. "Isn't that the creak of cordage I hear?"
                  he added.</p>
               <p>"No sir, I guess it's only the cracking and snapping of these old limbs over our
                  heads!"</p>
               <p>At that moment a sound like a deep but distant groan was heard.</p>
               <p>"What was that?" asked the old man, starting.</p>
               <p>"God only knows, sir. I've hearn that this part of the town is haunted. There has
                  been a heap of folks killed in town, and buried somewhere up this way, I've heard.
                  I've helped old Madame Sistill and Cospello to stow away more than one poor gal
                  and her dead baby underground, but not around here. I used to take them over to
                  Jersey, where they had poor Mary Rogers carried after she died in the old witches
                  house in Greenwich street. The papers said some rowdies murdered her, but them
                  editors was green. They didn't know beans. Who'd believe a gal could be murdered
                  or treated worse in open day in a place like Hoboken where thousands of folks
                  travel all the time. That was all <emph>gas!</emph> I helped to carry her over
                  myself—and know all about it and who seduced the poor thing. But that's none o' my
                  business, I got well paid for my work and got paid for keeping mum, too?"</p>
               <p>Again that groan was heard.</p>
               <p>"Who's there? There, <emph>there must</emph> be some one near us!"</p>
               <p>"Nothin' human by gosh! Boss I don't like this, I can't get skeered at nothing
                  that I can see or feel, but by thunder I don't want to fight a ghost!"</p>
               <p>"Poh—poh there is no such thing as ghosts!" said Whitelead shivering.</p>
               <p>A whisper, like the seething whistle of the icy wind came upon his ear—but three
                  words were spoken—they were "<emph>Remember Annie Quimby!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The millionaire trembled from head to foot—"My God, <emph>her</emph> name—can it
                  be <emph>her</emph> spirit!" he muttered. "No—no it cannot be, some one is here,"
                  he cried. "Look Jack, under the carriage, look every where, some one has tracked
                  us!"</p>
               <p>"Look yourself if you like to, that voice never was <emph>human!</emph>" said the
                  man.</p>
               <p>At that instant the rush of water dashed up by the schooner's prow was heard—then
                  the flap of her sails as she rounded too in the cove, backed her foretopsail and
                  hauled her jib sheet to windward, so as to lay too. Then the creaking of her
                  davit-blocks as her boats were lowered was next heard. In a few moments the sound
                  of oars from an approaching boat fell on their ears, <choice>
                     <sic>and and</sic>
                     <corr>and</corr>
                  </choice> an instant later a boat with Rudolph in it from the vessel, reached the
                  strand.</p>
               <p>"Ah you are here sir!" said he as he saw Whitelead.</p>
               <p>"Yes—where is your master, where the treasure?"</p>
               <p>"On board sir, he sent me to see if you were here. We are pursued and must
                  hurry!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that comes of his boldness in playing the English Lord off—but the treasure,
                  and my daughter where is she?"</p>
               <p>"Safe aboard, I wish both were on shore—we've no time to lose!"</p>
               <p>"True—I'll go off with you in this boat and come back with the treasure!"</p>
               <p>"And I'll go too!" muttered the old man who unobserved had approached in the
                  darkness. And as Whitelead stepped aft with Rudolph into the stern sheets of the
                  boat, the old man got into the bows, and unseen by the forward oarsman crouched
                  down under the grating. The boat was swiftly rowed alongside. Just as her bows
                  touched the vessel, a piercing shriek was heard from the cabin, and as Whitelead
                  sprang on deck he saw Boldart dragging his daughter Mary up by the hair of the
                  head, his face flushed with anger. Her face was pale with terror, she held a
                  lantern clutched in her hand and as she saw <choice>
                     <sic>her her</sic>
                     <corr>her</corr>
                  </choice> father she shrieked:</p>
               <p>"Oh father—father, save me—I am not fit to die yet—he will murder me!"</p>
               <p>"Villain, unhand my daughter!"</p>
               <p>"Villain back again into your teeth! She has ruined us all—she has lighted our
                  foes in their pursuit, they are close aboard now. Rudolph get the boat's crews
                  aboard, let the boats go adrift, fill away the topsail and draw the jib, we've
                  nothing left for it but to run the gauntlet now, and by the Eternal I'll do it if
                  they sink the craft under us all, or if I have to blow her up with all on board!"
                  yelled Boldart, as he loosened his hold upon the terrified girl.</p>
               <p>"You'll not take me to sea?" cried Whitelead.</p>
               <p>"Yes, or to h—ll, you old curse!"</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6988-00000036"/>
               <p>"My daughter and my treasure?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'll tie the whole in one bag and sink you forty thousand <choice>
                     <sic>fet</sic>
                     <corr>feet</corr>
                  </choice> under water!"</p>
               <p>By this time the schooner's head was turned toward the Hoboken shore, for her
                  lights being again hidden, Boldart hoped to elude his pursuers. For a short time
                  it seemed that he would, for he could see the lights on the pursuing vessel, and
                  her bearings, and the way they altered, could see that she did not change her
                  course.</p>
               <p>But suddenly that course was changed, for as the Cruiser drew out from the land
                  the gleam of her white sails was visible even in the darkness, and in a few
                  moments the flash of her pivot gun and the whistle of a shot that dropped just
                  astern, showed that she was discovered, that the dreaded warhounds were once more
                  upon her track.</p>
               <p>The schooner fired no more however, for her commander dared not for fear of
                  injuring the inhabitants of Hoboken or Jersey city and both vessel dashed down the
                  Hudson, the Cruiser heading for the Narrows, the U. S. Schooner heading a little
                  more to the Westward to try and cut her off.</p>
               <p>From the schooner however rockets were continually sent up as signals to the boats
                  and the steamer, which latter craft having also discovered the Cruiser was gaining
                  on her every moment, but like the schooner could not use her battery in
                  consequence of the towns which lay so near and directly in range.</p>
               <p>But her commander knew that as soon as he had passed Governor's Island and had an
                  opening in the bay, he could use his guns, or better still run his adversary down
                  and he kept on under a full head of steam.</p>
               <p>Boldart after having given orders to confine Whitelead securely in one part of the
                  vessel and his daughter in another, turned all his attention to his pursuers.</p>
               <p>"We must disable that cursed steamer!" he muttered, "I can beat the Schooner, but
                  the steamer will be alongside in less than ten minutes. Double shot our
                     <emph>long-tom,</emph> Rudolph, I'll try her a lick directly!" The gun was
                  shotted, its circular carriage was turned round and with an eye as cool as if he
                  was about to practise at a target. As the vessel was sheering across to reach his
                  wake, her starboard wheel was a fair mark.</p>
               <p>Boldart held the lock-string in his hand, once more he glanced over the long
                  brazen tube of the twenty-four-pounder, then its muzzle flashed fire, and while
                  his vessel trembled with the shock of the recoil, a smile passed over his face,
                  for he saw the splinters fly from the wheel, and as she fell off he knew that her
                  machinery was damaged.</p>
               <p>"Quick—another shot, I must try her again before she comes into her course!" he
                  cried.</p>
               <p>In less than twenty seconds the gun was reloaded, again he sighted it and
                  fired.—Again his fiendish smile, like lightning from a cloud, flashed over his
                  countenance. His shot had told. The steamer did not come upon her course again—she
                  was evidently disabled.</p>
               <p>"This firing will arouse the garrison at Fort Hamilton, Sir," said Rudolph, "if
                  the news of to-days work has reached them they'll sink us from the Diamond
                  Battery, before we can pass it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but we can avoid that—we'll run down through the Kills, around Staten
                  Island, and so out through the Amboy channel!"</p>
               <p>"But, Sir, the channel is intricate and narrow, full of bad bars, and if we ground
                  we are lost!"</p>
               <p>"We'll not get aground, I know every foot of the channel, as well as I know the
                  way from here down into the cabin. I shall go through the Kills!"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>WHEN Lieutenant Swivel reported the death of his commander, the battle with the
                  smuggler, and the loss of the Revenue Cutter, he also offered his services with
                  the remnant of the crew to assist in manning the schooner from the Navy Yard. It
                  is needless to say that they were accepted.—And at his urgent request, for he
                  would take no refusal, Dick Isherwood, the wounded mate was also taken on board.
                  With deep interest these worthies entered into the chase of the Cruiser, the one
                  because he wished to rescue poor Ada from the grasp of her vile abductor—the other
                  because his heart was burning to revenge the loss of his commander.</p>
               <p>When the vessels were dashing down the Hudson toward the sea, and the steamboat
                  was gaining on the Cruiser, Swivel's face was radiant with enjoyment.</p>
               <p>"We'll get the thieving Maroon now," he cried—"and I'll knot the rope that will
                  swing him high as Haman!"</p>
               <p>But his phiz became elongated, as he saw the effect of the two shots upon the
                  steamer; he had already seen that the Cruiser could out-sail the schooner. But
                  when he saw the vessel head in for the Kills, he smiled again, and went to the
                  commander of the schooner and said:</p>
               <p>"We can get her now, Sir! She evidently intends to run around Staten Island and go
                  to sea by the Amboy channel. I know every foot of it, it is a third farther around
                  than it is straight down. We can hail the boats and order them to guard the upper
                  end of the channel, then run down and head her off. We can whip her, I don't think
                  she is so heavy handed as we are, and if she is we can beat pirates or die a
                  trying. You have more battery than she has. She does not mount more than one big
                  gun, and two or three little swivels!"</p>
               <p>"You think it would not be better to follow her in that channel?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir—she has the heels of us by a long odds!"</p>
               <p>"I think she has, but this craft is a trimmer in a sea way!"</p>
               <p>"She'll never get to sea—if we head her off as we can!"</p>
               <p>"What do you think she took that channel for?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she was afraid of the guns at Fort Hamilton."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and by the way, the old fort might pitch some cold iron into us!"</p>
               <p>"They'll understand your signals won't they?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know. Sogers are stupid birds!"</p>
               <p>Passing within hail of the steamer, and learning that she was too much disabled to
                  continue the chase, the commander of the schooner requested the commander of the
                  steamer to co-operate with the boats in guarding the upper end of the channel and
                  stated his plans for cutting her off. He then continued down the bay, spreading
                  everything that her spars could carry to urge her on. Meantime her crew were
                  preparing for a struggle which they knew would be both fierce and desperate, for
                  all felt sure that they would meet the Cruiser, before she could reach Sandy
                  Hook.</p>
               <p>On, on she sped like a gull before the gale—soon the quarrantine ground was
                  passed, then in the darkness on the eastern shore the gloomy walls of Fort
                     Hamilton<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6988-00000037"/> rose to view. For a short
                  time as the schooner rushed on, no sound was heard on board of her, except the
                  rush of the foaming waves under her bows, for the crew dreaded an unfriendly
                  salute from the Fort.—They would not have shrunk from meeting the fire of their
                     <emph>foes</emph>, but it would have been hard to be slain by
                     <emph>friends</emph>. After rounding the shoal known as the West Bank, the
                  reach to Perth Amboy was open, but the Cruiser was not in sight. It was impossible
                  that she could have passed out, yet as they could see several miles up the bay
                  toward the channel from which they expected her, and she had had time enough to
                  come within sight at least, it seemed strange that she did not appear.</p>
               <p>"She can't have gone back and tried to get out through the Sound by Montauk, can
                  she?" asked the naval commander of Swivel.</p>
               <p>"No sir, I think not, we would have been apt to have heard the guns from the boats
                  or steamer had she tried that. I think she must have got aground, and if so the
                  crew may all be ashore and safe by this time.,'</p>
               <p>"Can you pilot us up the channel, safely, d'ye think?"</p>
               <p>"I don't <emph>think</emph> anything about it sir, I <emph>know</emph> it. I was
                  brought up in these waters, sir; waded for clams and dove for oysters when I
                  wasn't knee-high to a mudturtle?"</p>
               <p>"Well sir, take charge of her and try it, but for heaven's sake be careful and do
                  not shove us ashore!"</p>
               <p>"No danger, Captain, no danger. Only let a hand keep the lead going, the bearings,
                  from the lights, are as easy as ciphering!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <p>WE will now come back to the Cruiser, for it wont do to let any of our parties
                  part company long now, when we are so rapidly drawing our story to a close.
                  Reader, wouldn't you like to know how its going to turn out? <emph>I would!</emph>
                  I assure you, on the honor of a white-man, that you know as much about it as I
                  do.</p>
               <p>The "Kills," as the channel to the west of Staten Island is called, is entered at
                  the upper point of the Island. Wide flats extend far out in the bay at its upper
                  end—you have to keep close in to the Island after passing the White Beacon, first
                  above the point. The channel is then very narrow, in some places rocky, and filled
                  with oyster bars. Few but the oyster-men or their little clipper schooners, or the
                  market-men in their sloops, can safely navigate this passage at night, though
                  large steamers and other vessels guided by experienced pilots frequently make it
                  in the day time. The Camden and Amboy Railroad line of boats daily pass through
                  it, and many an one who reads these lines can probably remember having passed over
                  the very ground which we describe.</p>
               <p>She schooner entered the "Kills" with the breeze nearly abeam, and it came fresh
                  and strong off the low lands of Jersey. She was soon past Newark. Her skillful
                  master watching her course with a careful eye and often giving directions to the
                  helmsman had thus far conducted her safely through her perilous path. The
                  Highlands of Neversink were almost in sight, or at least the light-house upon
                  them, when the rough grating sound beneath the Cruiser's keel and then a shock
                  that nearly lifted every spar out of her, told her commander and crew that she was
                  aground.</p>
               <p>"Curse the luck—if we're <emph>fast</emph> we'll never get out of the scrape! D—n
                  the infernal port and them that ever got me into it! If we can't get the craft off
                  I'll hang that cursed old thief, Whitelead, to her yard-arm before I leave her!"
                  muttered Boldart bitterly. Then he added:</p>
               <p>"Rudolph, get out the long boat and lead out a kedge and hawser at once! Some of
                  you men go aloft and furl the light sails, we might as well get the sails off of
                  her, it only forces her farther on the bar. Take the small hand-lead in the boat
                  and try the soundings on the larboard bow. I must have got a few feet too far to
                  the westward. The channel here isn't a cable's length in width!"</p>
               <p>The sails were taken in, the hawser and kedge led out in the channel, a turn taken
                  to the capstan and every effort used to heave her off. It was no use, she wouldn't
                  budge an inch.</p>
               <p>By sounding, Boldart found that he had run his vessel on the point of an oyster
                  bar, and as he had correctly judged was but a few feet from deep water in the
                  channel. The only way to get her off was to wait for high tide, the tide when she
                  run on being at the last of ebb, or to lighten her by heaving ballast and stones
                  overboard. The latter alternative was the last to be thought of when a vessel was
                  bound as she was on a long voyage.</p>
               <p>"In two hours more I think the tide will float her, especially if we can shift
                  some ballast aft!" said Boldart to Rudolph.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6988-00000038"/>
               <p>"But sir, if <emph>they</emph> are after us, two hours will bring them up!"</p>
               <p>"Then we must beat them off, we have always done it so far and I do not feel as if
                  my star was in the descendant, yet. I have had no presentment that my time was
                  near and I've always had an idea that I'd get a warning before it did come! Hallo,
                  who is that grey-headed old man reading by the binnacle light—how did he come
                  aboard here?"</p>
               <p>This last remark of Boldart's was caused by his observing the old man whom we have
                  described, who was engaged in reading a paper by the light of the lamp in the
                  binnacle. That paper he had picked up from the deck where Mary Whitelead had
                  dropped it. The old man seemed interested in it, for tears rolled down his haggard
                  cheeks as he read it.</p>
               <p>"Who are you? How came you here?" asked the commander of the Cruiser, approaching
                  him.</p>
               <p>"I came on board with James Whitelead, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, <emph>his</emph> friend?" asked the pirate, and his brow darkened with a
                  frown.</p>
               <p>"No, his bitterest foe. I hate him, curse him—followed him because I hate him. He
                  did not see me when I got into the boat, but I saw <emph>him</emph> and his look
                  of despair when you had him taken below to be confined. I knew that he was safe
                  and I was satisfied for the time."</p>
               <p>"You are a strange man, who and what are you?"</p>
               <p>"Not what I once was. I am an outcast, friendless—if you want to know more, I'll
                  tell you bye and bye. James Whitelead did it all—curse him, <emph>he</emph> did it
                  all!"</p>
               <p>"Well, old man, I will hear your story after we get out of this cursed hobble.
                  Till we do I shall be too busy to attend to you. But make yourself at home!"</p>
               <p>The old man bowed his thanks and went on reading the paper which he had before
                  been perusing.</p>
               <p>Meantime Rudolph and Boldart went forward again to use every exertion to get their
                  unlucky craft afloat. A tight strain was kept upon the hawser and the men set to
                  moving aft every article of weight which could be got at, so as to lighten her
                  bows up as much as possible. The kedge-anchor had been dropped well out in the
                  channel, well abaft the beam so as to back her off. No more could be done except
                  to wait in patience for the tide which had now begun slowly to rise.</p>
               <p>With his glass in his hand, and often peering out into the darkness to see whether
                  his pursuers were approaching, Boldart impatiently paced the deck. The crew were
                  kept at their quarters ready to repel any sudden attack.</p>
               <p>What the feelings of old Whitelead were, who found himself confined a prisoner on
                  his own vessel, may be better imagined than described.</p>
               <p>His daughter, again calm and freed from the momentary terror of death, had again
                  assumed her blithe and haughty mien, and as she paced to and fro in the state-room
                  where Ada had not moved from the position in which we left her. Pale, tearless,
                  still as if she were dead, there she sat, feeling heart-stricken and deserted.</p>
               <p>An hour passed on thus, an hour, perhaps <emph>more</emph>, when Boldart, whose
                  glass had long been pointed down the channel suddenly cried:</p>
               <p>"Stand to your arms, my lads, that cursed man o' war schooner has headed us off
                  and is coming up the channel? Lay aloft sail loosers, loose and set sail quick,
                  she musn't think we're aground. If she doesn't she may try to luff up to windward
                  of us and if she does she is gone. She'll be ashore like ourselves!"</p>
               <p>In a few moments the obedient crew had their craft again covered with canvas, and
                  then for the first time she was seen by the Naval officer, for her naked spars had
                  not before caught his eye. As Boldart had predicted, he tried at once to get the
                  weather <choice>
                     <sic>guage</sic>
                     <corr>gauge</corr>
                  </choice>, for he fancied her to be under all sail, and in spite of the repeated
                  warnings of Swivel, he luffed up for the western shore.</p>
               <p>Too soon he had occasion to repent his false judgment, for suddenly his schooner,
                  when within a quarter of a mile of the other vessel, was brought up all standing
                  on an oyster bank.</p>
               <p>"There, I told you so, and you wouldn't listen to me? I knew we were too far to
                  windward!" said Swivel.</p>
               <p>"We are no more to windward than the schooner!"</p>
               <p>"I know that sir, but like her we are aground!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> aground? Thunder, don't you see she's got all sail set!"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, she has—and it was done either to trap us, or to force her over the bar <choice>
                     <sic>she she</sic>
                     <corr>she</corr>
                  </choice> has stuck on. That she is aground, you can see in a minute—she doesn't
                  near us an inch and we're stuck as fast as a bishop on a fat salary!"</p>
               <p>"You are right, Lieutenant Swivel—you are right. But how are we going to get out
                  of this cursed fix, or capture that d—d<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"

                  carry him by our boats?"</p>
               <p>"We <emph>might</emph>, then again we mightn't! This boarding a vessel that has
                  got a batch of swivels, a long gun and a desperate crew of cut throats aboard of

               <p>"No, sir, by no manner o' means, but I don't see what else we can do. We lay so
                  fair bows on to him, that none of our large guns can be brought to bear on him. If
                  you will conclude to assault him, I will lead the attack with my crew and either
                  die on his decks, or carry them!"</p>
               <p>"We would have to take all our force from the vessel!"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, of course, but they are no good here now, and if we carry her we will
                  have the glory and honor and lots of prize money!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I expect he would be a prize. I've a great mind to attack him!"</p>
               <p>"I think we can take him sir!"</p>
               <p>"Had we not better wait for daylight, that will soon be here?"</p>
               <p>"No sir, for I pretty nearly know the number of his crew, he don't know ours. By
                  all means let us pitch into him soon if we do at all!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll order out the boats. You shall command one division, I the other. We
                  will attack him on both bows at once!"</p>
               <p>"Well sir, I am ready?"</p>
               <p>The schooner's sails were furled, her boats got out and the crew being mustered
                  aft, were told in a brief speech by their commander what they were expected to do,
                  the perils they were about to encounter and the value of the prize they were
                  expected to conquer or to perish in the attempt to do it.</p>
               <p>His address was received with cheers, as American seamen are apt to receive such
                  from officers who are ready to <emph>lead them</emph> on, not to order them to go,
                  and soon all was ready for them to shove off.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <p>THE actions on board of the schooner had been closely watched by Boldart. He had
                  smiled in triumph when he saw the schooner ground, he smiled when he saw her sails
                  furled and her boats got out.</p>
               <p>"Rudolph," said he—"We are going to have another merry time. The infernal rascals
                  are going to board us, or try to I believe!"</p>
               <p>"Had I not better get up the swivels, sir, and mount them forward?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, my lad and see each one crammed to its very muzzle with musket balls. Have a
                  few hand grenades on deck—tell the cook to fill his coppers and have his <choice>
                     <sic>huckets</sic>
                     <corr>buckets</corr>
                  </choice> ready to give them a drink of hot water!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye sir!"</p>
               <p>"And as you pass along, say a word to the boys, we shall be afloat in a few
                  minutes I'm sure. See that a man stands ready with an axe to cut the hawser if she
                  should go off and see that every man is armed properly. Tell them, that if we beat
                  back our foes, we will have a free path to the open sea, and then hurrah for our
                  own Island Home. I'll neither raise tack or sheet, or look into a port, till we
                  get there and then for a jolly time and a good rest, that we may enjoy our
                  spoils!"</p>
               <p>A murmur of satisfaction passed along through the crew as the lieutenant
                  communicated the captain's message. No louder noise was heard, for they were
                  quietly awaiting an attack in which they knew many a man would be silenced
                  forever.</p>
               <p>It is ever a still moment when deadly foes advance to mingle in terrible strife.
                  Like the calm which precedes the storm it is awful in its dark and sombre
                  quiet.</p>
               <p>Slowly and steadily in two lines, the boats approached from the schooner. In the
                  leading boat approaching on the starboard bow, could be seen the gaunt form of
                  Swivel, standing in the stern sheets with a naked cutlass in his hand. On the seat
                  by his side was Dick Isherwood, who though weak and almost helpless would not be
                  refused a share in the peril.</p>
               <p>On came the boats. When they were within a few hundred feet of the Cruiser,
                  Boldart who stood forward, hailed them.</p>
               <p>"Boats ahoy—you'd better go back aboard of your craft, we've crew enough here to
                  get us off—we don't need your assistance!"</p>
               <p>"But we need <emph>yours</emph>—spring to your oars boys, on like <emph>men</emph>
                  and Americans, and clear that cursed Pirate's deck!"</p>
               <p>A wild cheer arose from the boatmen as they bent all their strength to the oars.
                  They were close aboard—a hundred feet and they would touch her sides. As yet no
                  gun had been fired—but suddenly from a dozen swivels, planted on the bow rails and
                  well depressed, belched forth a blaze of fire and a shower—a terrible shower of
                  leaden hail.</p>
               <p>The crash of splintered planks and oars—the groans of dying and the shrieks of
                  wounded men, rose awfully on the night air.</p>
               <p>No shout of victory from the cruiser, but the quick stern command: "Stand by to
                  repel boarders!" was heard.</p>
               <p>As the smoke cleared away, Boldart had a chance to mark the terrible effect of his
                  fire. All the boats of the division destined for his larboard bow had disappeared.
                  A few black objects splashing and spluttering in the water was all that could be
                  seen of their crews. One boat of the other division still floated, and with but
                  three or four oars out was striving to come on.</p>
               <p>"Shall I load a swivel and send that fellow to kingdom-come?" asked Rudolph.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it's a pity, for they are a brave set, but those who play with fire must
                  expect to get burned!"</p>
               <p>"She moves, Sir, our vessel moves, she is going off Sir!" cried the man who had
                  been stationed at the lead to watch the rise of the tide.</p>
               <p>"Good, by heaven's good! Just in time!" cried Boldart. "Stand by to cut the hawser
                  as she swings off the bank. Attend sheets and braces, some of you!"</p>
               <p>As the vessel moved off, the only <choice>
                     <sic>remain-maining</sic>
                     <corr>remaining</corr>
                  </choice> boat of the boarding expedition touched her bows. But two of her crew
                  ever got on board, one was Isherwood, who fell and fainted from weakness, as he
                  tumbled over the rail, on the deck—the other was the gallant Swivel, who received
                  a half dozen pike and cutlass thrusts as he gallantly sprang on deck.</p>
               <p>"There's a dose for one you!" he cried as he drove his cutlass to the very hilt in
                  the breast of the man whose pike had already pierced his body. Then he fell
                  forward, without a groan. He was <emph>dead!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Used to such scenes some of the crew pitched his body overboard and were about to
                  do so with that of Isherwood, when Boldart came forward. By the light of a lantern
                  which one of his crew held, he recognised the face of the mate who some days
                  before had pitched him off the Williams-burgh ferry boat.</p>
               <p>"Hold on there!" he cried—"that fellow isn't dead yet, and I've a reckoning to
                  settle with him. Take him below, dress his wounds and treat him well!"</p>
               <p>The vessel was now fairly off—the hawser was cut and once more, like a wild steed
                  broke loose from its fastenings, she bounded along the channel. With a more
                  careful eye Boldart now conned her, and soon she was sweeping out in the broad
                  reach north of Sandy Hook.</p>
               <p>Light after light and all the beacons appeared soon, and ere the grey dawn had
                  made them <choice>
                     <sic>dimn</sic>
                     <corr>dim</corr>
                  </choice>, she had gained an offing.</p>
               <p>Once more her crew rejoiced that they were. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"On the glad waters of the dark blue sea,</l>
                        <l>Their souls as boundless, their hearts as free."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> And they had cause to rejoice triumphantly. They had run the gauntlet of
                  their foes—they had beat off the boat attack from the cutter, disabled a man of
                  war steamer, that otherwise would have captured them, and now had closed up by the
                  almost entire destruction of the United States Schooner's crew, and disenabling
                  her to fire a single shot as she swept by them in triumph. And all this had been
                  done at the cost of only four or five lives on their side.</p>
               <p>After his vessel drew out from the land, Boldart gave orders to Rudolph to serve
                  out a double ration of spirits and food for his crew, and to divide the watches so
                  that a portion might get rest which they now indeed needed.</p>
               <p>When the sun rose the hazy-blue outlines of the Highlands were but just visible in
                  the western board. Here and there the white sails of in-coming or outward bound
                  crafts could be seen; but the Cruiser bounded on unheeding all. She was on her own
                  element now. Her sharp bows seemed to dally with the waves as they clove them
                  asunder, rearing snow-white fleecy rolls of foam up on either side, flakes of
                  which, like white roses scattered by a fairy hand, would be cast upon her deck.
                  The great blue waves, lifting high, seemed swelling like a proud woman's bosom
                  when it throbs with feeling. And each quivering spar bending under the weight of
                  canvas, which bellied to the Nor' West gale, seemed as it creaked to speak its
                  joy, for from the icy climes of the north to the spicy breeze of the south, it
                  helped to bear a joyous crew.</p>
               <p>The sea <emph>is</emph> beautiful! It is the mirror of GOD—earth is but HIS
                  foot-stool, in Heaven is his starry throne, but in the ocean we can best see HIS
                  dread power reflected. Oh how many a happy, <emph>happy</emph> hour have I spent
                  upon the ocean. In its stormiest mood I love it best. Like a mother tossing her
                  loved babe up in her arms and catching it safely again and smiling upon its
                  needless fears, has she seemed to me. But forgive me for my rhapsody—memory will
                  float off with me once in a while and then <q>
                     <l>"I am an ocean child again!"</l>

               <p>The course of the White Cruiser was now shaped for the far off Mollucas, where
                  amid beds of red and white coral, where purple sea-fans reared their tree-like
                  heads, where shells, bright-hued and beautiful, pillow themselves upon the bosom
                  of the snow-white spong, arose the Island home of the "Unheard of."</p>
               <p>The gale was fair and fresh, danger had been overcome, all seemed smiling to those
                  who were on deck. How fared it with those who were below? Let another chapter
                  tell.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <p>IT was near noon when Boldart having shaped his course and seen everything
                  arranged to his desire, descended to his after cabin. Ada, who had not tasted
                  food, was still seated on the sofa where he left her. Her inward excitement was
                  such that she had not felt sea-sick from the motions of the vessel.</p>
               <p>But when she felt the touch of his hand as he seated himself by her side, she
                  started, and looked him in the face with her large, dark blue eyes.</p>
               <p>His face was not <emph>now</emph> flushed with passion, his eyes did gleam with
                  the fire of unholy love. He looked quiet and sad. His manner reassured her,
                  somewhat—she did not shudder as she had done before.</p>
               <p>"Lady, will you not seek some repose. In yonder state-room is a luxuriant couch, I
                  pledge you all that I have left of honor that you shall <emph>not</emph> be
                  disturbed in your slumbers. You can fasten your door on the inside—no harm shall
                  befall you!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir, <emph>please</emph> put me on shore where you took me from!"</p>
               <p>"I cannot now, even if I wished. We have had to fight our way out of New York
                  harbor, we are far out upon the sea, we cannot return!"</p>
               <p>"Where will you bear me too!"</p>
               <p>"To a lovely spot in a balmy clime, where you shall be happy!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Happy?</emph> ah, no sir, never! Though I was poor, worked late and early,
                  still I was happy till you tore me from my home—I shall be happy no more!"</p>
               <p>"Fair girl, it is useless for me now to regret—it is too late; but I would lay
                  down my life rather than make you wretched. I love you—not <emph>now</emph> with
                  the wild passion which lately burned so fiercely in my breast, but with a calm,
                  deep and endless love, so mingled with <emph>respect</emph> that it never again
                  shall offend you. Go sleep in peace, when you wake you will find refreshments
                  ready. You are Queen here—I was the King, but <emph>now</emph> I am your
                  slave!"</p>
               <p>He rose and left the saloon. She, worn out with fatigue and excitement, entered
                  the state-room which he had pointed out, and fastening the door cast herself upon
                  the couch.</p>
               <p>The next visit which Boldart paid was to old Whitelead. The latter, being unused
                  to the sea and of a billious temperment, was awfully sea-sick. Ever an anon, as he
                  lay moaning in his berth, he would cast up his reckoning with Neptune and groan
                  out a prayer that he could set his foot once more on shore.</p>
               <p>When Boldart entered he cut the thongs with which his crew had bound the lawyer's
                  hands.</p>
               <p>It was time this was done, for the ropes had cut deep creases in his wrists and
                  the blood was ready to burst from under his blackened finger nails.</p>
               <p>"Where are we, Boldart—where are we—you are not going to carry me off to sea, are
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"I am, sir. You are at sea now?"</p>
               <p>"But I cannot leave—my property, all my affairs unsettled!"</p>
               <p>"You need not trouble yourself about your property or your affairs—you will not
                  need property in another world, whither you are shortly bound!"</p>
               <p>"Boldart, what do you mean?"</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6988-00000041"/>
               <p>"Call me by my right name, you old wretch—call me Albert Quimby!"</p>
               <p>"It is true—that <emph>is</emph> your real name, but who has told you this?"</p>
               <p>"That she devil, your daughter!"</p>
               <p>"She did not know it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes she did, she found your papers and learned all—told <emph>me</emph> all in
                  her infernal spite!"</p>
               <p>"My God, she whom I so loved has ruined me. Well, Albert, what do you intend to do
                  with me?"</p>
               <p>"To try you for the seduction of my mother—for her murder, and to hang you for it
                  from the yard-arm of this vessel!"</p>
               <p>"Albert, think what I have done for you. This vessel I gave you—I fitted her out,
                  I educated you!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to serve your own infernal purposes—you educated me to crime, to rob to fill
                  your coffers. I am a thief, a pirate, a murderer, and <emph>you</emph> educated
                  me. Thanks to <emph>your</emph> tuition, I shall know now how to deal with

               <p>"You will never be more fit. You ask for mercy, you refused it to my mother. You

               <p>"Oh, Albert, do not, I am nearly dying now—I am <emph>so</emph> sick!"</p>
               <p>"Poh, you'll be sicker yet before I am done with you. But none of your whining
                  now, you've got to answer me some questions, and if you do not answer them
                     <emph>truly</emph> I'll rend you limb from limb—I'll pierce your eves with
                  red-hot irons, tear your lying tongue out by the roots, and cut your quivering,
                  cowardly, black heart all alive and palpitating from your breast!"</p>
               <p>"Oh horrible! Albert, ask what you please. I will not deceive you!"</p>
               <p>"Where, then, is my sister?"</p>
               <p>"As God is my judge I do not know!"</p>
               <p>"Liar, tell me, or I'll wring the secret from you. I know how to torture—my
                  education is complete!"</p>
               <p>"I do not know where she is. When your mother died some one took her away, I have
                  never seen her since!"</p>
               <p>"I don't believe you, else why should your daughter know. From you or her that
                  secret shall be torn. Is my father living?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I saw him for the first time in many years!"</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"In the city."</p>
               <p>"What was he doing?"</p>
               <p>"I know not—he spoke to me, followed me, upbraided me with his ruin!"</p>
               <p>"Ah—a thought strikes me. Is he very thin and old and haggard—his hair long and
                  white, his frame bent with premature age?"</p>
               <p>"Yes I saw him but a moment—but as you have described so he appeared!"</p>
               <p>"Well Sir, I will leave <emph>you</emph> for a short time to repent of your sins.
                  Do not attempt to stir from this state-room—a sentinel stands at your door with
                  orders to strike his dagger home to your heart if you offer to move hence. You
                  shall have food and drink!"</p>
               <p>"May I not see my daughter?"</p>
               <p>"No—not at present I have questions yet te ask her!"</p>
               <p>And as these are all important reader, and ladies should ever receive from a true
                  gentleman extra attention, we'll do as some religious sexts do, who make the
                  ladies sit on one side of the Church and the men on the other, we will devote the
                  following chapter to the lady.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <p>WHEN Boldart, or Albert Quimby, as we had better call him now entered the
                  stateroom in which he had confined Mary Whitelead, he did not find her either in
                  tears, or sea-sick. Proud and haughty as if she were a queen instead of being a
                  prisoner. She stood with folded arms at the farther end of the little room, nor
                  did her eye quail or her countenance change as she met his glance.</p>
               <p>She looked wildly beautiful. Not gentle not exactly majestic, but wild. Her long,
                  dark hair streamed down loosely upon her snowy shoulders—her face was flushed with
                  anger, her lips compressed firmly, her arms folded over her magnificent bosom
                  which throbbed like a heaving sea with the angry tumult of passion which raged
                  within, she looked like a Juno trying to slay Jupiter with her frowns.</p>
               <p>He spoke first.</p>
               <p>"Be seated, Madam," he said—"I have come to have some conversation with you!"</p>
               <p>"I presume Sir, it will be as gentle and kind, as chivalrous and noble as was that
                  which you used towards me last night when clutching me, a feeble woman by the
                  throat in your brutal, giant grasp, you forced me on deck to murder me!"</p>
               <p>"It was your own fault if I was rude lady, last night, it will be your own fault
                  if I am not gentle to-day!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Sir, perhaps you have come to woo me, to make love to me—perhaps you have
                  tired of your other leman!"</p>
               <p>"Woman, woman, speak not of <emph>her</emph>. Compared to you she is as pure as an
                  angel is in the midst of fiends!"</p>
               <p>"A happy comparison, Sir—a very happy comparison, Sir. She <emph>is</emph> in the
                  midst of fiends and you, the chiefest of them all will leave her precious little
                  purity to boast of, I expect, before she parts company with you!"</p>
               <p>"A truce to these taunts, I am not in the humor to hear them now. Did you not say
                  last night that you knew where my sister was?"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>did</emph>, Sir!"</p>
               <p>"Where is she?"</p>
               <p>"That is my secret!"</p>
               <p>"By high heaven you shall reveal it!"</p>
               <p>"Nothing <emph>under</emph> high heaven can make me, Albert Quimby, once when I
                  gave my heart to you, but a few hours ago, you could have had every secret it
                  contained—all was yours, I was ready to yield soul and body to you, but now I hate
                  you all as fervently as then I loved, and I scorn and defy you!"</p>
               <p>"Woman tempt me not too far. Do not trifle with your fate—remember that your life
                  is in my hands!"</p>
               <p>"I do, and being so, it is worthless. Kill me, coward, if you dare. In my death
                  I'll triumph over you!"</p>
               <p>"Mary Whitelead there is an after-life!"</p>
               <p>"Is there? do you <emph>realy</emph> think so? Are you going to turn pious and
                  preach me a sermon. You had better go up on your blood-stained deck and call your
                  murderers together and read prayers to them!"</p>
               <p>"You infernal fiend? You rare enough to put a saint out of temper!"</p>
               <p>"Noble and complimentary Captain, if I disturb the serenity of your gentle and
                  forbearing temper, your saintship can leave my presence. I did not <choice>

                  much as I feel <emph>honored</emph> by your visit!"</p>
               <p>"I will leave you for a time, Madam, but I only leave you for reflection. You
                  shall have food and proper attendance, my page shall wait upon you. But mark my
                  words. I will give you from now until sunset to reveal that secret and if then you
                  do not inform me where my sister is—I'll wring it from you with torture! Yes,
                  those beautiful limbs of your's shall suffer, I'll send the beauty from your
                  cheeks and dim the lustre of your eyes!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, that <emph>would</emph> be noble! And <emph>so</emph> you think my eyes
                     <emph>lovely</emph>. I've half a mind to tear them out to spite you!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Do!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh, you wish me to do it? Then I <emph>won't</emph>!"</p>
               <p>"Farewell till night, Madam, reflect on what I have said and be ready!"</p>
               <p>"Farewell, <emph>dear</emph>, <emph>brave</emph>, good, noble, Albert—<choice>

               <p>Boldart did not wait to hear the sarcastic woman's bitter taunts to their close.
                  He left the room.</p>
               <p>When he was gone how quickly she altered. She had braced herself up to her task,
                  but when the object of her task was gone, again she became a woman. She cast
                  herself upon her couch and burst into an agony of tears. Her frame shook with the
                  sobs from her over charged heart. No mental reaction is greater than that caused
                  by anger.</p>
               <p>"<emph>He</emph> will torture me!" she moaned, "he whom I could have loved to very
                  idolatry. Torture me a poor, frail woman, but no he <emph>could</emph> not. He is
                  brave, he has proved that. None but a coward would abuse a woman—yet, last night,
                  he did abuse me. But it was my own fault. I had taunted him to madness and was
                  then trying to betray him and his crew to death. I cannot blame him, I
                     <emph>will</emph> not—but the secret, He shall not have that without I can win
                  back his love. Oh if he would but love me!"</p>
               <p>"Madam!" said a low sweet voice by her side.</p>
               <p>She turned her head and saw Geronimo.</p>
               <p>"Madam, my master sent me to you, to bring you refreshments—what will you please
                  to have?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Geronimo," said the lady, drying her eyes, you told me last night that you loved
                  your mother!"</p>
               <p>"I did, lady!"</p>
               <p>"And that you hated this <choice>

                     <corr>fair-haired</corr>
                  </choice> girl whom your master is madly in love with!"</p>
               <p>"Yes lady!"</p>
               <p>"Why do you not slay her, then boy?"</p>
               <p>"Lady, I am young, my arm is weak and it requires a strong arm to strike a
                  woman!"</p>
               <p>"Can you not get poison and give it in her drink?"</p>
               <p>"My master has deadly drugs in a casket which I have known <emph>him</emph> to
                  use, but I have feared to do it!"</p>
               <p>Ha! He has poisons—are they quick and deadly?"</p>
               <p>"I believe so lady."</p>
               <p>"Can you not bring me some of them—some powder or colorless liquid, which can be
                  mixed with her food?"</p>
               <p>"But she will not eat lady. Not a morsel of food—only a little water has passed
                  her lips since she has been on board!"</p>
               <p>"Water? That will do, and of it she will not be suspicious. She must die,
                  Geronimo, she must die!"</p>
               <p>"Is it not terrible to kill a woman, lady?"</p>
               <p>"Boy, will not your mother die when she sees that this woman has robbed her of
                  your master's love?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, oh yes lady. I will get the poison, the woman <emph>shall</emph> die?"</p>
               <p>"Brave, good boy. Get me the poison first, then bring me some wine for myself. By
                  the way, is not that a pretty dagger you wear in your belt—will you lend it
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, lady, willingly." When the boy left her, Mary Whitelead glanced for a moment
                  at the dagger.</p>
               <p>"Should the worst, come to the worst I have a <emph>friend</emph> here!" she said
                  as she placed it in her bosom," I will use it, not to defend my honor, for that I
                  have lost, but the weapon may serve to fulfil my vengeance."</p>

               <p>THE first person whom Boldart sought, after leaving the lawyer's daughter, was
                  Dick Isherwood. He had not seen him since he had ordered him to be carried below
                  the night before. He now wended his way to the forward part of the vessel, where a
                  room had been prepared for the sick and wounded. He found Dick laid out at length,
                  very comfortably on a cot, with a glass of something that did'nt look like any
                  other kind of medicine than that which is now most popular in Maine, where they
                  say there is a great deal of sickness, and lay the cause not to any regular <choice>
                     <sic>epedemic</sic>
                     <corr>epidemic</corr>
                  </choice>, but to a disease called the Legislative fever.</p>
               <p>When the commander of the Cruiser approached the cot, Dick raised his eyes and
                  recognized him at once.</p>
               <p>"You know me, I suppose, Sir?" said Boldart.</p>
               <p>"I think I do! I lifted you once from aboard the ferry boat, when I was mate of
                  her—I tried to lift you again, but you carried too heavy metal for me and I was
                  floored! What of it—a <emph>man</emph> can't die but <emph>once</emph> if a cat
                  does nine times.</p>
               <p>"Are you aware that I command this vessel!"</p>
               <p>"I supposed so when you kept the crew from heaving me overboard!"</p>
               <p>"Are you aware why I spared you then?"</p>
               <p>"No, unless you wished to kill me yourself, when you had more time—was that
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"No, you are a brave fellow, with good points. If you'll be one of us you can fare
                  well and perhaps rise to promotion!"</p>
               <p>"Captain, I've only one objection!"</p>
               <p>"And what is that?"</p>
               <p>"It can be spoken in a few words. <emph>I'll see you d—d first!</emph> I'm an
                  American, a Sergeant in the Governer's Blue's, and I'll never link myself with a
                  gang of bloody pirates! Now will you answer me a couple of questions?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, you are so candid, I'll not refuse you!</p>
               <p>"Do you know why I came aboard here?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Then, before I ask the next question, I'll tell you. I came here to try to rescue
                  the poor girl who you tried to follow over the ferry, and who you have
                  abducted!"</p>
               <p>"Well, you failed!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and now I'll ask my other question! Is she on board?"</p>
               <p>"She is!"</p>
               <p>"My God—and ruined—no friend to help her?"</p>
               <p>"She is not ruined—she is not friendless!"</p>
               <p>"You are not her friend!"</p>
               <p>"I am, but you seem very much interested in her. Perhaps you are a relative!"</p>
               <p>"No—no—I never spoke to her until that day, but I love her—kill <emph>me,</emph>
                  but do not harm her!"</p>
               <p>"Dismiss your fears for her safety—and forget your love for her. She shall not be
                  harmed, nor shall you my brave fellow—but forget her!"</p>
               <p>"I cannot! I would not if I could—I would die for her—may I not see her for a
                  moment?"</p>
               <p>"Not now—I will see you again,—you shall be well treated!"</p>
               <p>The commander of the Cruiser now ascended cended to the deck, and walked aft. The
                  old man was seated near the taffrail, gazing quietly out over the water, seeming
                  to be very well contented. In his bosom was deposited the paper which he had
                  picked up from the deck, the night before. In his heart its secrets were held. But
                  oh, how little did he dream that every person save one, of whom it treated, was
                  then near to him. If he had known all, the blood of youth rushing through his
                  veins would have given him new spirit, yes, would have gladdened the long frozen
                  channels, like new and generous wine.</p>
               <p>"Well, my old friend, how have you got along?" said Boldart, in a kind way, as he
                  came up to him.</p>
               <p>"Better here than elsewhere, Captain, thank you!" said the old man, rising.</p>
               <p>"Well, can you give me that name and history now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes Sir, I am ready, but the history is a long one—I want no other ears to hear
                  it but yours, and then I want you to judge between me and James Whitelead, and see
                  if I ought not in my just vengeance to send him howling down to hell. I have in my
                  bosom a document, strangely obtained, for I picked it up from your deck last
                  night, which reveals most of my wrongs, and opens to me that which was dark
                  before. That I will read to you and tell you all the rest!"</p>
               <p>"It is well, come below with me to my private cabin, and there, where no one can
                  interrupt us, we can converse!"</p>
               <p>The old man followed him as he descended into the cabin. Ere he went down however,
                  as was ever his won't—the keen eye of Boldart scanned the horizon in every
                  direction, to detect the appearance of strange sails, and aloft to see that the
                  spars were right, and every sail in its place, drawing so as to give full effect
                  to the breeze.</p>
               <p>All was clear around them. The silvery coronet of the horizon bound old ocean's
                  azure brow, and not a spot dimmed its brightness. On—<emph>on</emph> like a
                  prisoned bird just set free, the Cruiser dashed, her snowy wings often dipping in
                  the spray—her crew, now happy, recounting one to another marvellous tales of hair
                  breadth 'scapes, or quietly enjoying the fumes of the "weed" from pipes that
                  looked "ancient as the hills.</p>
               <p>It is singular how "old salts" love to spin fore-castle yarns, and sing old quaint <choice>

                     <corr>ballads</corr>
                  </choice> which would make modern dandy authors and poets faint. Many a time, when
                  I was a youngster at sea, I've sat or stood for hours, forward, and listened to
                  them and learned things which I cannot now forget. But few novelists of the
                  present day or even of the past century have done justice to the character of the
                  sailor.</p>
               <p>COOPER, our great American Novelist, was but four or five years in the Navy, never
                  crossed the Line or doubled the Horn, and his greatest conception, Natty Bump's,
                  or old Leather Stockings, and other shore-characters, prove that he was more at
                  home on land than on sea.</p>
               <p>Ingraham, never in the Service, and never out of sight of land without being
                  sea-sick, was a clever writer on shore, but he didn't know a clew-garnet from a
                  monkey-tail, or the difference between a reef-knot, a granny-knot and a

               <p>We have not an American Author now living who can, in a sea Novel, do justice to
                  the subject. A writer to do it must have been for years a follower of the sea,
                  familiar with all climes, with storm and calm, conversant with men and manners
                  before and abaft the mast, a master of the modern languages (for I was never
                  aboard of a man o' war where we had not some men of nearly every nation, French,
                  Spanish, Scotch, Danish, Irish, Dutch, Italians, English and "<hi rend="i"

                  disasters, escapes, battles and the incidents of a cruise upon the ocean.</p>
               <p>MARYATT was the best delineator of sea-life that I ever read. He was born and
                     bred<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6988-00000044"/> and educated a

               <head type="sub">THE OLD MAN'S STORY.</head>
               <p>WHEN the old man and Boldart were seated in a state-room, which closely joined
                  that wherein Ada was sleeping, the pirate Chieftain closed it, opened a locker
                  from which he took some generous wine to refresh the old man, who looked so feeble
                  and wan that he excited pity even in the hardened breast of the Pirate.</p>
               <p>Of the wine, however, he partook very sparingly and then he commenced his story. I
                  give it in his own words:</p>
               <p>"It is many years that I have to run back to commence my history, for to
                  appreciate my hatred for James Whitelead you must know all. It is over thirty
                  years since I met my angel Annie, who though she broke my heart was ever loved, is
                  loved though she now sleeps in an unmarked, unhallowed grave. She was beautiful, I
                  can see her now—her soft brown hair hanging in glossy curls down upon a neck and
                  shoulders spotless as the lilly which was born of water and sleeps upon the bosom
                  of the lake; perfect in form, her large blue eyes speaking in light the thoughts
                  of her soul; majesty enthroned upon her brow, purity wrapped like a bridal robe
                  all around her, Good, pure, lovely, God in heaven alone can tell how much I loved
                  her. I wooed and won her. She loved me—we were happy. We had <choice>
                     <sic>been been</sic>
                     <corr>been</corr>
                  </choice> married but a year when a boy was born. Oh how my young heart leaped
                  with joy when that young angel was given to us, and I felt that she was safe from
                  peril. I forgot that it had been born into a world of trouble—I looked upon it as
                  the gift of a good God who thus far had blessed us.</p>
               <p>And more and more, she seemed to love me—the child seemed like a golden link made
                  to wrap our hearts, as were our hands together. It grew up. Oh, well do I remember
                  how proud I felt when the wee thing first began to notice me and laugh and chirp
                  when I entered the room when I came home from business. And how happy I was when
                  Annie would tell of all the cunning tricks the "little mischief" had played during
                  the day—how it would take off its little shoes and stockings as it sat upon the
                  floor and look upon her and laugh as if 'twould say,—"Mama I want my feet <choice>
                     <sic>to to</sic>
                     <corr>to</corr>
                  </choice> grow, I <emph>wont</emph> wear shoes!"</p>
               <p>I almost counted each golden hair that came out upon its head—I watched each tooth
                  that came out like a pearl in its rosy mouth, I kept a notched stick with inch and
                  quarter inch measures on it to see each day or two how much taller it had grown, I
                  watched it as a gardner watches the growth of some rare and beautiful flower which
                  no one but himself <emph>can</emph> raise, which by the least neglect would
                  perish.</p>
               <p>A year passed on—he could say <emph>papa!</emph>" He could walk! I was so proud of
                  him, so happy with my <emph>dear</emph> wife! She more lovely if possible in her
                  womanhood, than when in her girlish beauty I wooed and won her, seemed as happy as
                  myself, what had we to make us unhappy. Nothing then till the base destroyer came
                  like the serpent entering the garden of Eden whispering <emph>lies</emph> into her
                  cars.</p>
               <p>I was wealthy, doing a large and profitable business. There was no wish of hers
                  expressed by look or word, or hint, that I did not hasten to gratify. Oh, God, why
                     could<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6988-00000045"/> not that heaven on earth, of
                  which she was the sole guardian angel have lasted!"</p>
               <p>The old man paused, tears rolled down his withered cheeks, though age had come
                  upon him, though like a lightning-shivering tree he was blasted and alone in his
                  desolation, there was still <emph>life</emph> in his heart. He could
                     <emph>remember</emph>!</p>
               <p>Boldart offered him more wine. This he refused, and in a few moments resumed his
                  story.</p>
               <p>Another year passed on and happiness still shone like the <choice>

                     <corr>pleasant</corr>
                  </choice> spring sun-light upon our flowery path. About this time I first met
                  James Whitelead. He was a young man who had just entered upon the practise of law,
                  but he was poor and friendless. He had no books, no influential friends to aid him
                  when aid is most needed, in the first steps of a lawyer's career. I saw that he
                  had talent, I thought him honest and honorable, and I became his friend. I loaned
                  him money to buy him a library, he was an oft invited guest to my table, an ever
                  welcome visitor to my family circle.—My business was such that I had often to
                  employ legal advice. I always employed him, and never gave him the trouble of
                  making out his bill—I feed him liberally and in advance, for I knew that he needed
                  money. I had funds to spare, I got him to loan them out on mortgages, and trusted
                  to him to invest securely.</p>
               <p>Two years more pass on, and he, from a poor young obscure lawyer, had risen to a
                  respectable position at the bar. He was well-dressed, had as fine a library as any
                  attorney in the city, was looked upon with interest by the leading jurists of the
                  day, had been complimented by Story for his knowledge and sagacity in threading
                  the labarynthian mazes of the law. As my friend and <choice>
                     <sic>protogee</sic>
                     <corr>protegee</corr>
                  </choice>, I looked upon him with pride. I saw him daily—not a day passed when he
                  was disengaged that he did not visit my house.</p>
               <p>He seemed like a brother toward Annie,—he seemed as fond of our child as we were
                  ourselves.</p>
               <p>And time rolled on for another year. Annie was soon again to be a mother. With
                  increased care I watched over her, and it seemed as if I loved her more, but to
                  love her <emph>more than</emph> before was <emph>impossible</emph>. My love then
                  was <emph>worship</emph>!</p>
               <p>The next angel came into the world. It was a girl, and oh how happy we were that
                  it was so, for we had prayed for a sister for our beautiful boy. And Whitelead
                  seemed to share in our joy. Our first born was delighted with his little doll of a
                  sister. It seemed as if Heaven had marked us out as special objects for its
                  choicest blessings.—Prosperous in business, and happy at home, I would not have
                  changed positions with an Emperor—no, not to have been Emperor of a world.</p>
               <p>As our last child grew along, its beauty seemed even to exceed that of our
                  boy.—How we watched each bud of beauty as it opened and blossomed into life.</p>
               <p>Time rolled on, my business did not seem so prosperous; several vexations
                  law-suits occurred, and in some of these, even in spite of the talent of my bosom
                  friend, Whitelead, I was the loser.</p>
               <p>But for these I cared but little—I was wealthy and able to retire from business at
                  any hour.</p>
               <p>But a new trouble now came upon me. I fancied that my wife grew colder in
                  her-love, that her caresses were less ardent, her expression less fond, when she
                  welcomed me home as I came from my business. It might have been mere fancy, yet it
                  wore upon me and I became restless and unhappy. My children, though still dearer
                  to me than life, were not so often caressed—I did what I <emph>never</emph> before
                  had done, resorted to wine to raise the unnatural depression of spirits. I did not
                  indulge, it is true, to excess, but I drank.</p>
               <p>Noticing from my manner the alteration, Whitelead, whose visits to my house were
                  daily, with an apparent anxiety which seemed based on profound friendship,
                  enquired what was the matter. I candidly told him and he laughed at what he called
                  my folly, said that my fears were groundless, that she loved me devotedly. I tried
                  to think so, but each day I could see a change.</p>
               <p>Oh little did I think that then, each day a plausible villain, one to whom Iago
                  was as a saint in comparison, was through hints and inuendoes undermining me in
                  her affection. Affecting to excuse, aggravating the errors which he had caused,
                  pitying her and pretending to feel as a brother.</p>
               <p>She <emph>was</emph> changed. At last I <emph>knew</emph> it. The iron entered my
                  soul. Like an iceberg it rested on my heart, the heart which she had so blessed. I
                  drank more, became really intemperate, for in wine alone could I drown my
                  wretchedness. And then her coldness increased—our home once a paradise to me was
                  such no longer.</p>
               <p>My <emph>only</emph> friend seemed to be Whitelead. He passed half his time at our
                  house. Though he would never drink wine there, when we were out he would drink and
                  urge me too, and often with friendly care he would see me safely to my home, when
                  I was not fit to take care of myself. Then, when hard words passed between me and
                  my wife, he would come like an angel to pour oil on the troubled waters and to
                  heal our differences.</p>
               <p>And thus things went on, getting worse and worse. One night I came home, pretty
                  well heated with wine, for I had dined with some friends or rather they had dined
                  with me at a fashionable restaurant. I was therefore in tolerable good humor, and
                  entered the house with the expectation of seeing my wife and children. But I
                  looked for them in vain. I asked the servant where they were.</p>
               <p>"Missus has been cryin' pretty nearly all day, Sir!" said the servant, "and about
                  two hours ago when a carriage came she took the two children and went away in it.
                  Before she went, she gave me this letter for you, Sir!"</p>
               <p>Trembling in every limb I seized the letter and tore it open. My God! She had left
                  me! I was sobered in an instant. Her letter was short, but oh how much terrible
                  woe was there in it for me. She told me that she had borne with my neglect and bad
                  habits, until she could bear them no more, that her heart had lost its love for me
                  and that she had been compelled to listen to one who loved her, pitied her, and
                  who would not neglect her as I had done. She told me that it would be useless for
                  me to seek her, ere I had read the note she would be safe from my pursuit. That
                  she would take care of my children, better care than I could, for she loved them.
                  Her letter was written cold and severely, but it had been blotted by her
                  tears.</p>
               <p>Oh then I felt how I <emph>had loved her!</emph> Her words of reproach pierced my
                  heart like daggers, I even forgot that her first coldness had driven me to
                  dissipation. I cursed the hour when I was born, I raved in utter madness. I sought
                  for a weapon with which to take my hated life. I would have used it—but at that
                  moment my dear friend Whitelead came in. I put the letter in his hands, sat down
                  and wept, wept like a child! He read it and seemed utterly astounded. For a time
                  he seemed speechless from surprise, and then he strove to comfort me. He <choice>
                     <sic>pited</sic>
                     <corr>pitied</corr>
                  </choice> me, he reasoned with me, and at last calmed me somewhat. He proposed
                  some wine; I drank, drank deeply, but liquor had no effect upon me then. My mental
                  suffering was to powerful to yield to artificial stimulants, and though bottle
                  after bottle was emptied, I did not become intoxicated. Oh little did I then dream
                  that James Whitelead had caused all my misery, that then she was under the roof of
                  a house owned by him, which he had bought with my money—that his lies had led her
                  off, that he had plotted and succeed in her ruin and my own. Yes, he was the
                  tempter, the betrayer, the robber. Worse than <emph>Judas</emph> who betrayed <choice>
                     <sic>Chirst</sic>
                     <corr>Christ</corr>
                  </choice> with a kiss; worse than Arnold who for gold would have sold his country;
                  worse than the devil incarnate, who bade Eve eat of the forbidden fruit and
                  thereby brought sin and death into the world; <emph>he</emph> was the fiend, the
                  monster who had done this! But then I knew it not. <emph>Aided</emph> by him, who
                  seemed doubly officious now, I sought for her everywhere—I neglected my
                  business—hired agents and spies to watch for her, offered rewards, but<pb
                     n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6988-00000046"/> I could get no tidings of her or my
                  children.</p>
               <p>After this, I madly entered into speculations and all kinds of dissipation. Of
                  course I lost, and soon my business affairs were in a bad state. I had creditors,
                  for I had endorsed for several friends who were introduced to me by Whitelead, but
                  in consequence of failures in realising profits from speculations the
                  responsibility of their unpaid notes fell on me.</p>
               <p>To save what I had and to keep them from at once ruining me, I gave all I had, my <choice>
                     <sic>mortages</sic>
                     <corr>mortgages</corr>
                  </choice> and all my estate up to James Whitelead, giving him as he advised me, an
                  acknowledgement of previous indebtedness to make it secure, of course it was only
                  done in trust and as soon as I had passed through the legal course of bankruptcy,
                  was to be returned.</p>
               <p>At a meeting of my creditors, soon after, angry words ensued between one of them
                  and me. He called me a liar, cheat and swindler. I retaliated, he struck me, and
                  in the heat of anger returned his blow with a penknife which I had taken from my
                  pocket but a moment before. It was not done, God knows, with malice or
                  forethought. I struck him when I was blinded by anger, but the blow was fatal. The
                  blade entered his abdomen, and though he lingered in agony for more than a week
                  he, DIED!</p>
               <p>I was seized and borne to prison. I sent for Whitelead to bail me out, but they
                  would not take bail. I told him to defend me, and to employ the best counsel in
                  the city to aid him, not to share my money. He promised to do this. For seven long
                  dreary weeks I lay in prison. But twice in all this time did he come to see me.
                  When I asked him why he so neglected me, he pleaded business, and said he was
                  preparing to use every exertion to save me in my coming trial. He felt sure that
                  he could avert a severer penalty than an imprisonment, and said he then could buy
                  a pardon for me, or hire political influence enough to get me one. I believed him
                  still, for I knew not what he was!</p>

                  like a beast, caged or chained, I had to sit. The witnesses against me, my
                  indignant creditors were there—I knew they would say all they dared to say on oath
                  to convict me. I had no witness on my side. But my lawyers, my <emph>dear
                     friend</emph> Whitelead, and his associates, where were they? <emph>Not
                     there!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The Clerk called up the case, the Judge asked who was my counsel.</p>
               <p>I named him.</p>
               <p>"Why is he absent?"</p>
               <p>I could not give the reason. At this moment, a diminutive creature who though <choice>

                     <corr>on</corr>
                  </choice> the list of lawyers was never recognised by them, entered the court in
                  breathless haste, and said that he had been deputed by Mr. Whitelead who had been
                  suddenly taken very ill, to attend to the case. A sneer passed over the face of
                  every lawyer present—a look of surprise marked the countenance of the Judge. They
                  knew that <emph>he</emph> was not fit to defend even a petty larceny case, in fact
                  better fitted by practice and education to act as the criminal in such case, and
                  wondered why he should be selected by a lawyer of Whitelead's knowledge, in a case
                  so important. The fellow's name was Naughton.</p>
               <p>I at once protested against his acting as counsel, and asked the court to defer my
                  trial until Mr. Whitelead could be present. The court would not do this, but said
                  other eminent counsel were present and disengaged, and if I stated that I was
                  unable to employ counsel he would assign one that would do me justice. I dared not
                  say before those creditors that I was able to employ such talents, for but a few
                  weeks before I had sworn that I was bankrupt, and I had to ask the court to assign
                  me counsel. The Judge did, and called upon one of the smartest members of the New
                  York Bar, who readily consented to undertake the task, although he asked the court
                  for time to prepare for the case, and endeavored to get the trial laid over at
                  least until he could consult Whitelead.</p>
               <p>To this the court would not assent, remarking marking that as the case was
                  apparently a very aggravated one, that I had had time to prepare for trial and
                  that it must go on.</p>
               <p>The witnesses were examined—of course their evidence was against me. My counsel
                  could not by the strictest cross-examination elicit anything which could tend to
                  my favor. His only ground of defence was that there was no malice that the deed
                  was done in a moment of anger caused by unjust and exciting epithets and by a
                  blow, that the knife was not drawn for the purpose. Ably and eloquently did he
                  contend for me. But his efforts were used in vain. The <choice>

                     <corr>prosecuting</corr>
                  </choice> attorney did not say much to the jury, it was unnecessary. The evidence
                  was before them. They never left the box when the case was given to them by the
                  court, they were not two minutes in deciding and their verdict was "GUILTY." The
                  Judge did not remand me to await my sentence. He at once sentenced me to ten years
                  hard labor in the States' Prison at Sing Sing.</p>
               <p>When I heard that terrible sentence, my wrung heart failed me and I wept bitterly.
                  Had the sentence been <emph>death,</emph> I could have borne it better.</p>
               <p>I was removed from the court room, manacled, to be conveyed to the gloomy walls of
                  the prison. I sent word to Whitelead and sent for money, but received no reply. I
                  was taken to the prison and then commenced the <emph>living death,</emph> the
                     <emph>hell</emph> of a Convict's life. Illy fed, worked almost to death, kicked
                  and cuffed by brutal keepers, I often wished for death to release me from my
                  torments.</p>
               <p>Time passed on, no word from Whitelead, no sign of a pardon. I got the prison
                  chaplain, my only friend then, a good, kind man he was, to write to him for me,
                  but no answer came.</p>
               <p>At last ten years rolled by, and grey-haired with premature age, worn down by
                  labor and care, I was discharged from prison without a penny in my pocket.—Working
                  my passage on a sloop, I reached New York. On my getting there I enquired for
                  James Whitelead. Everybody knew him, he was rich, the <emph>good, rich</emph> Mr.
                  Whitelead! I found his house easily, it was a palace up town in the most
                  aristocratic portion of the town.</p>
               <p>I rung the bell, a liveried Irish servant came to the door. I asked him if Mr.
                  Whitelead was at home.</p>
               <p>"Not for the likes o' ye!" the wretch replied. "The masther don't want no beggars
                  hangin' around his door!"</p>
               <p>"I'm no beggar!" I cried, tell your master, James Whitelead, I want to see
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Be off—to the devil wid ye!" replied the fellow pushing the door in my face.</p>
               <p>But I was determined not to be put off in that way. I opened it—the menial struck
                  me. I was weak, but anger gave me strength and I dashed him against the wall and
                  he fell senseless to the floor. A door opened I could see a gay party of gentlemen
                  and ladies seated at a festive board. But I did not look at them, for he who
                  opened the door and cried in a rough voice—"what means this noise"—was
                     <emph>him</emph> whom I sought!</p>
               <p>"James Whitelead, do you not know me?" I said.</p>
               <p>Altered as I was he <emph>did</emph> know me. For an instant he turned pale, then
                  stepping forward and shutting the door so that his guests could not hear him, in a
                  hoarse whisper, he said:</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>convict</emph> I know you, leave my house!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Your</emph> house. Where is my money?" I cried. "Give me back my own, else
                  will I crush you to the earth as I did yonder menial who called me beggar!"</p>
               <p>"Leave this house or I will call the police and send you to prison!"</p>
               <p>"Do it if you dare," I replied—"so that I can have the pleasure of exposing you to
                  the world in a Police Court!"</p>
               <p>"Who would believe you!" he said with a cold sneer. "What can you say to harm a
                  man of my wealth and <emph>respectability, you</emph> a poor beggarly discharged
                     <emph>convict</emph>!"</p>
               <p>"Do, James Whitelead I could tell them that you are a thief, have robbed me!"</p>
               <p>"You had better add to that, it wouldn't sound strong enough. Tell them that I
                  seduced your pretty wife, that I kept her as<pb n="92-93"
                     xml:id="VAC6988-00000047"/> my mistress till I got tired of her and then sent
                  her out to starve or do worse. Tell them <emph>that;</emph> it will be as true as
                  the rest of your story but still they wont believe you <emph>and</emph> you'll be
                  sent to the Asylum as a madman, or to the Island as a vagrant!"</p>
               <p>My God, what thoughts flashed over me. I remembered how <emph>brotherly</emph> he
                  had been to <emph>her</emph>, and like lightning disclosing a dark and horrid
                  gulf, filled with writhering serpents, to midnight traveller, his whole devilish
                  plot flashed upon me. I would have crushed him on the spot, but I wished to learn
                  more. Mastering the passion which like a volcano's hidden fire was raging in my
                  breast, I asked him <emph>where</emph> my wife and children were.</p>
               <p>"If you are alive, when they die, I will tell you!" he said sneering again.</p>
               <p>I could stand no more, I had no weapon or I would have slain him on the spot, I
                  sprang toward him, but ere I could <choice>

                  grasped from behind by the Irish servant who had recovered and who tripping me up
                  held me powerless upon the floor. The noise of the scuffle instantly <choice>

                  almost senseless. Policemen were sent for and upon his charge of entering his
                  house with intent to rob it, and assaulting himself and servant, I was borne off
                  to prison. All that I said about him was not listened to, he had said truly that a
                  convict would not be believed when a rich and therefore <emph>respectable</emph>
                  man made a charge against him.</p>
               <p>Again I was imprisoned, and the moment I was discharged from that, again was
                  arrested and always at his instigation. I am now old and worn-out, but if I can be
                  revenged on <emph>him</emph> I will die happy. Last night from a paper picked up
                  on your deck I learned all of his wickedness—I learned what he had made of my

                  have that and I am willing to die!"</p>
               <p>The old man took the roll of paper from his bosom and handed it to Boldart. Ere
                  the latter opened it, he asked:</p>
               <p>"What is your name old man?—your history strangely interests me!"</p>
               <p>"Braham Quimby!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Quimby!</emph> my God it cannot be; you spoke of your boy, what was his

               <p>"Albert was the name Annie chose for him!"</p>
               <p>"My God, I must be that boy! Yes, you are my father. Whitelead reared me up, he
                  told me I was an orphan, when I was but a child he sent me to sea and he,

               <p>"My boy, my lost Albert? Oh, can it be—yes, you have his features, Albert it must

               <p>"I <emph>know</emph> she does, and I will find out where, soon; and when I do, she
                  too shall know that she has a father and a brother still living!" Thus we have

               <p>It was near sunset. Mary Whitelead was sitting in her state-room, and seemed pale,
                  anxious and nervous.</p>
               <p>"If the boy fails—if she does not take it—I cannot triumph over him!" she
                  murmured.</p>
               <p>A moment or two later the boy Geronimo came in. He too was pale, his hand
                  trembled, but he raised in it a small glass phial, and it was empty.</p>
               <p>"You have done it boy, you have done it?" she asked eagerly,</p>
               <p>"Yes lady, she asked me for water, I poured the poison in it, she seemed thirsty,
                  drank all of the water!"</p>
               <p>"Bless you my little darling—all now is safe, she will not rob your mother of his
                  love, and I shall triumph! Come, kiss me."</p>
               <p>The boy did so, but he shuddered. Much as he had seen of strife and crime he
                  wondered that a woman so beautiful could glory in a murder. He had acted under her
                  advice and had administered the portion to Ada, but his motive was so different
                  from hers. He <emph>loved</emph> his mother, he wished Ada to be out of her way.
                  She cruelly contrived the heartless murder of the innocent, helpless girl to spite
                  him, knowing how crushingly the blow would come upon his heart. With a
                  fiendishness like that which made Catharine de Medicis notorious, she gloried in
                  her crime.</p>
               <p>The boy left her, but she retained the empty phial. It was a little rose-colored
                  one, and had a label on it marked in some tongue unknown to her.</p>
               <p>An half hour later and Albert Quimby entered the room. He was calm, but his pale
                  face, and closed lips, and cold demeanor, told her that he had not come to
                  trifle.</p>
               <p>"Well lady, I have come to know your decision. Will you now tell me where my
                  sister is?"</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, when I get ready!"</p>
               <p>"Are you not ready now?"</p>
               <p>"Not quite!"</p>
               <p>"Then I will try and assist in hurrying you. Walk out in the cabin with me, if you
                  please!"</p>
               <p>"With pleasure sir, this apartment is rather confining for one so fond of freedom
                  as I am!"</p>
               <p>"Lady, your sarcasm is lost on me. I have determined to wring your secret from
                  you, and if kindness will not do it, torture shall!"</p>
               <p>"Sir, you are <emph>very</emph> polite and obliging! I will follow you?"</p>
               <p>When they went out into the larger cabin, Mary Whitelead saw a sight which for a
                  moment unnerved her. Her father, bound hand and foot, was seated in a chair,
                  trembling all over as he gazed upon the old man, who with folded arms and a look
                  of relentless hate stood before him, muttering low and bitter curses and threats
                  in his ear.</p>
               <p>Near by him stood a tall, repulsive looking negro who held a scourge (better known
                  as the cat-of-nine-tails) in his hand. Several men, all looking heartless and
                  ferocious, armed with other implements of torture stood around. The boy Geronimo,
                  pale as a corpse, not understanding the meaning of all this preparation, stood
                  quivering with terror in the group.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mary Whitelead, I ask you again to tell me where my sister is?" said
                  Albert.</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with my<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6988-00000048"/> father?
                  Why sits he there bound like a slave?"</p>
               <p>"To have the pleasure of seeing you scourged till the blood runs from your neck
                  down to your heels, if you refuse to tell me what I ask. You need not expect
                  mercy, nor may he. There stands <emph>my</emph> gray-haired father whom
                     <emph>your</emph> father ruined—who, from your father's efforts has had to
                  spend half of his life in prison. Your father murdered my mother, cruelly murdered
                  her, seduced her from a good husband, and then let her starve and die neglected.
                  He reared me up to be a smuggler and pirate, made me an outlaw and an outcast,
                  that I might serve him and gain wealth for him. His fate will soon be
                     sealed—<emph>his</emph> doom is at hand. But if you will tell me where she is,
                  how I may find her, I'll land you safely where you can reach New York in a few
                  hours, and where you can enjoy the wealth which his death will leave you heir
                  too!"</p>
               <p>"And would you scourge a woman, <emph>brave</emph> Captain?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, murder her by inches, if she would not reveal the place where I can find my
                  sister! Refuse and I will bid that negro to tear your dress from your
                  shoulders—bind you as your father is bound and commence. I warn you again that I
                  am not to be trifled with!"</p>
               <p>The haughty woman glanced at the negro and those terrible men who seemed but
                     <emph>too</emph> ready to obey their master's orders. but her look of
                  confidence remained, she did not exhibit fear. With a cold, sarcastic smile, she
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Your sister, sir, is in Heaven, or at least her spirit is. Do you see
                     <emph>this?</emph>"</p>
               <p>She held up the empty phial, and <choice>

                  all. <emph>Now</emph> where is your <emph>triumph?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Ada, my sister, <emph>dead</emph>—dead on board of this vessel!" cried Albert,
                  springing towards the state-room door. It was locked on the inside, but he burst
                  it open. There she lay, <emph>so</emph> fair, <emph>so</emph> beautiful!</p>
               <p>The old man too, rushed in—"it is—it must be my daughter; the fiend spoke truly,
                  she is dead!"</p>
               <p>"No, father, see, she breathes—she yet lives. Let me bear her out!"</p>
               <p>"Ha—ha! Does she not make a <emph>pretty</emph> corpse?" cried the woman-fiend,
                  holding up the phial in her hand.</p>
               <p>The Captain snatched it from her grasp, then his look of wretchedness vanished as
                  he read the label on it.</p>
               <p>"She-devil that you are, you have <emph>not</emph> triumphed!" he shouted. "She
                  lives, that phial did not contain poison, it is only a sleeping potion—she is
                  safe!"</p>
               <p>"Then this, <emph>this</emph> shall do the deed!" cried the woman, springing
                  toward the sleeping girl with the bound of a tigress, and drawing the dagger which
                  she had concealed in her bosom. One moment's delay and the keen weapon would have
                  been sheathed in that pure breast, but with a bound like that of a lion that turns
                  upon its hunter, Albert threw himself between her and her intended victim, and
                  struck the arm which held the dagger helpless by her side.</p>
               <p>"You have foiled me now, but I will triumph yet, without in your
                     <emph>manhood</emph> you choose to take my life from me!" she muttered, as she
                  fairly gnashed her teeth in her rage.</p>
               <p>"Seize and bind her!"—cried Albert.</p>
               <p>It was done, and she was placed on a seat near her father. <emph>He</emph> seemed
                  stupefied with terror.</p>
               <p>Albert and his father now endeavored to awake Ada from her unnatural sleep. They
                  bore her to her state room for scenes were about to be enacted which they did not
                  wish her to witness.</p>
               <p>Now for the first time in many years, years which had been mantled in woe, the <q>

               <p>IT was an half hour later. The sun had vanished behind the uprising walls of
                  night, but the pale moon looked down from a clear and cloudless sky,
                  silver-plating the waves through which the "Cruiser" clove her trackless way.</p>
               <p>And in the forward cabin of the vessel <choice>

                  <emph>trial</emph> was about to commence. Thither had Whitelead and his daughter
                  been borne, still bound as when we last saw them. The same grim attendants were
                  there. But the scourge of the negro had been laid aside and he held on his arm a
                  coil of long, stout rope, in one end of which a noose was made.</p>
               <p>Paler than before, if possible, Whitelead sat stupid in his fear, for he who had
                     <emph>lived</emph> so wickedly could not <emph>die</emph> fearlessly, and he
                  knew that death awaited him!!</p>
               <p>Sternness imprinted on their countenances the father and son sat before him,
                  regarding him in silence. At last that silence was broken by the son.</p>
               <p>"James Whitelead," he said, "you sit before your judges, those whom you have
                  cruelly wronged, before a son whom you have made motherless, before those whom you
                  have robbed and ruined. We have full proof of your villainy, what have you to say
                  in your defence?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing—nothing, but spare my life!" moaned the man. "I am too bad to die, do not
                  murder me here on the wild sea, take all my wealth but set me and my child on
                  shore once more!"</p>
               <p>"Wretch, what mercy had you for my mother? Look back over your past life. Think
                  how like a demon you invaded the home of my father, how by base treachery and

               <p>"<emph>Death!</emph>" said the old man, sternly, solemnly.</p>
               <p>"Mercy!" moaned the wretch.</p>
               <p>"Aye, the mercy you gave to my poor mother. If you dare to pray, pray now to the
                  God before whom you will appear in half an hour. Your moments are numbered.</p>
               <p>"Oh Braham Quimby, mercy—mercy! Return, take all my wealth, but give me life—I am
                  not fit to die!"</p>
               <p>"Father, you are a <emph>coward!</emph> Why stoop to ask life from pirates and
                  murderers!" cried Mary Whitelead, her proud lip curling in scorn and her eyes
                  flashing defiance. "I am but a <emph>woman</emph> and I fear them not, be a man
                  and hate, defy them as I do. Tell them to kill me first and I'll show you
                     <emph>how</emph> to die!"</p>
               <p>Whitelead did not heed her words or even look at her. Selfish always, he only
                  thought of himself then, and father as he was would have sooner sold her life than
                  lost his own. He looked at the father and son—looked for one gleam of mercy, one
                  ray of hope in their countenances, but looked in vain. He knew then that he must
                  die and he wept and howled in his <choice>

               <p>He did not pray, he knew not how. While revelling in wealth and powerful to<pb

                  could never render less enormous, he had scarcely believed in a God, had mocked at
                  religion as he had defied law. But now when he saw the gaunt form of the hungry
                  King of Terrors before him, when the icy hand of Death was reaching out ifs
                  freezing fingers to clutch him in its iron grasp, he felt that there was a God;
                  that there was a hell, that from the "GREAT I AM," he could not expect mercy, that
                  hell was yawning to receive him.</p>
               <p>At a sign from Albert, the huge negro, who held the rope in his hand, east the
                  noose around old Whitelead's neck.</p>
               <p>"Cat loose the rope which binds his feet; he must go on deck now!" said the
                  commander.</p>
               <p>They did so, but the horrified wretch was unable to walk.</p>
               <p>"Carry him up! And carry up his daughter too, she knows his crime and must witness

               <p>"Why not let me <emph>share</emph> it, noble and brave pirate, it is as manly to
                  murder a woman as it is to slay a poor old man!"</p>
               <p>"Woman, beware, your time will come! Had you murdered my sister, you too should
                  now suffer with him. But you shall live long enough to see her happy, and that
                  will be your worst punishment!"</p>
               <p>"Happy! Yes, as happy as you <emph>meant</emph> to make her when you abducted her
                  before you knew who she was. I'll either see her the leman of some of your
                  murderous crew, or perhaps of yourself!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Woman</emph>—but no; I'll not bandy words with a fiendish hag like you!

                  <head>THE EXECUTION.</head>
                  <p>The party stood forward upon the vessel's deck. The crew were all there, and as
                     Rudolph had told them the crime of Whitelead, they looked with stern
                     satisfaction upon, and aided in the preparation of his punishment. The end of
                     the rope which was fastened around his neck was run through a hole on the
                     foreyard-arm, its end passed down and manned by a large portion of the crew,
                     who stood ready to run him up. Two heavy chain shot were fastened to his fact
                     to sink his body beneath the water, after the rope had been cut.</p>
                  <p>All was now ready. The old villian saw that but a moment intervened between him
                     and death, he tried once more to plead for mercy. It was useless.</p>
                  <p>"Oh Mary, kneel to him and beg him to spare me only for another day!"</p>
                  <p>"Never, father, not to save ten thousand lives would I crave a favor from him.
                     You are a coward!"</p>
                  <p>Albert raised his band as a signal, a half-choked shriek and a convulsive gasp
                     as he felt the rope tighten, burst from Whitehead's lips, and then in an
                     instant his body was swaying in the air. His convulsions were horrible—he was
                     dying by strangulation. Wary Whitelead looked for a moment on his writhing
                     limbs, on his distorted features, his tongue protruding from his mouth, his
                     eyes seeming about to burst from their sockets, she could bear no more, the
                     devil in her nature yielded, she shrieked and fell senseless to the deck.
                     Albert had her borne below.</p>
                  <p>At the same time the convulsions of her father ceased—he was dead! He had paid
                     the fearful penalty of crime by a terrible death. At another signal from
                     Albert, the rope was cut, and with a sullen splunge the body sunk beneath the
                     rolling sea, never again to rise until the archangels trump shall call the dead
                     up from their graves on sea and land.</p>
                  <p>During all this scene the father had sternly stood and silently watched the
                     scene. He had not shuddered at the terrible sight which the dying man
                     presented, nor had he heeded his piteous pleadings for life.</p>
                  <p>But when he heard the plung of the body as it entered the yawning gulf—when he
                     could see his foe no more, he turned away and wept. What brought tears to his
                     eyes? It was not for the death of the wronger he wept. No, but it was because
                     he remembered the <emph>wronged</emph>. He thought of her whose corse lay in a
                     pauper's grave—of her who once had been all in all to him, who he had blessed
                     in the very fullness of joy.</p>

               <p>AFTER the execution was over, Albert descended to the cabin accompanied by his
                  father. There they met Ada, who now that she knew this relationship trembled no

                     <corr>tearful</corr>
                  </choice> eyes listened to her father's story.</p>
               <p>Oh how different now was the love which lighted his eyes as he gazed upon the
                  beautiful form of his beloved sister, from the passions which had formerly raged
                  in his breast. She who had so lately feared him, did not, could so suddenly love
                  him, but all fear was banished from her heart. She even listened with interest to
                  his description of the Island home, toward which they were speeding so rapidly,
                  and longed to tread upon its flowery carpet. After a short time had passed thus
                  pleasantly, Albert bethought him of the attempt made to poison Ada, by Mary
                  Whitelead, and for the first time the thought came into his head how she could
                  have obtained access to the drugs in his casket. He knew that there must have been
                  some traitor in the matter, for now else could she have learned that he had a
                  casket of drugs there and obtained the one which fortunately she had mistaken for
                  poison. She had been confined to her room—no one but himself and Geronimo had had
                  access to her.</p>
               <p>"Ada," he asked, "of what have you partaken since you were on board?"</p>
               <p>"Only of water, brother!" she replied.</p>
               <p>"And my page brought you that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, brother!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, then it was he—and I have ever found him trusty too! Strange for one so young
                  too! I must see to this."</p>
               <p>He rung a small silver bell that lay upon a table near him and the boy appeared to
                  answer the summons. His face was pale, his eyes were red—he had been weeping.</p>
               <p>"Geronimo!" said his master sternly, it was you who conveyed the drug intended to
                  poison my sister!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my master, but I did not know she was your sister, I only knew that you
                  loved her, and knew that if my mother lost your love she would die. The woman
                  urged me to it!"</p>
               <p>"What should be your punishment, Geronimo?"</p>
               <p>"Death, my master—I expect it, but do not tell my mother <emph>you</emph> had it
                  done—I am all that she has to love but you, my matter!"</p>
               <p>Oh surely you will not put him to death, my brother, he so young and beautiful. I
                  forgive him, would have forgiven him with my dying breath. Remember we once had a
                  mother to love!" pleaded Ada.</p>
               <p>"I shall not harm him, Ada, but Geronimo, never again betray the trust I repose in
                  you! And beware of that wicked woman, hold no further conversation with her. Black
                  Anselmo shall act as her servant, he is as faithful as he is hideous!"</p>
               <p>The boy knelt and kissed the hand of the fair girl who forgetful of his intended
                  wrong plead so earnestly for his life. And she wiped the burning tears from his
                  eyes as kindly as his mother would have done. How like an angel she seemed.</p>
               <p>"Ada, I have now another pleasure in store for you!" said Albert. I have an old
                  acquaintance to introduce to you!"</p>
               <p>"An acquaintance, my brother!"</p>
               <p>"Yes one who thinks all the world of you, who has rendered you good service,
                  too!"</p>
               <p>"Brother, you speak in riddles!"</p>
               <p>"Then I will soon unravel the riddle. Geronimo, go and tell Rudolph to assist the
                  wounded stranger into the cabin, this will be his home hereafter—have a stateroom
                  prepared for him!"</p>
               <p>In a few moments, leaning heavily on the arm of Rudolph, the steam-boat mate
                  entered the cabin.</p>
               <p>"You are welcome here Mr. Isherwood. I need scarcely introduce you to my sister
                  Ada, you have seen her before!" said Albert.</p>
               <p>The mate looked confounded. His face which was as pale as snow, when he entered
                  flushed up red as carnation.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Your Sister, sir?</emph>" he stammered.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>my</emph> sister, and there is our father, sit down, your are weak,
                  bring some wine here. Geronimo. Sit down by her side and she will tell you all. I
                  must go on deck. How does the weather look, Rudolph?"</p>
               <p>"There's a storm blowing sir, from appearances!"</p>
               <p>"Ah then I must go up and take a glance. Our bonnie craft bears a precious cargo
                  now—bears what is more precious to me than all the gems and gold the sea has ever
                  swallowed!"</p>
               <p>Albert and his lieutenant went on deck and blushing even more than she who had
                  recognised her brave defender, Isherwood seated himself by Ada's side. And as
                  theirs might be loving words, we'll not listen to them, but go on deck and listen
                  to the shrill music of the storm.</p>
               <p>"Music of the storm? Is there music in the storm?" the timid reader asks.</p>
               <p>Aye, to a bold, free heart, music far more sweet than the low-toned breathing of
                  love-laden lips! Our lofty spars bending to the gale, each rope a harp-string, the
                  solemn dash of the mighty waves clashing like cymbals all around. The wild shriek
                  of the glad sea-bird, the cannonry of heaven opening from the clouds—all, all is
                  music to a brave mariner's soul.</p>

                  waters. When death comes, bury me there, where the earthworm may not creep, let
                  mermaids twine coral in my hair and lay me in shelly caves to sleep.</p>
               <p>When Alfred and Rudolph returned on deck they found indeed that a storm was
                  brewing. The clear, cold sky, so clear now that it seemed almost day-dawn on the
                  sea, the gradual rising of the wind which in fitful gusts began to show its
                  temper, like a spoiled baby getting too big for its long clothes. Though the gale
                  was still fair and enabled them to keep their course, yet as they were in the gulf
                  stream, it blowing against the current rolled up a tremendous sea into which the
                  schooner pitched and tumbled as if she was drunk, threatening to toss the very
                  spars out of her.</p>
               <p>Albert therefore found it necessary to take in and shorten sail and to house her
                  lighter upper spars, royal and topgallant masts. This his experienced crew did
                  with cheerful alacrity and when the watch below (one half of the crew) turned into
                  their hammocks for the night, they felt as secure and safe as if they were resting
                  in a monarch's palace on the shore. In fact some of the old salts like my ancient
                  ancestor Tommy Buntline, did I could aver rejoice at the fact that they weren't on
                  shore where houses sometimes blow down, where babies fall out of two-story windows
                  and break people's necks as they pass underneath. Oh it is a happy place, would I
                  were there now."</p>
               <p>The night passed on and the gale increased.</p>
               <p>Albert remained on deck, for a Nor' west gale in the Gulf is by no means as
                  pleasant as a spicy breeze in the southern seas, or as safe as a gale where the
                  trade-wind blows long and steady. As morning came on, and the hour for dawn
                  approached the wind began to die away. To a landsman this would have seemed a good
                  omen, but a heavy bank of clouds rising darkly in the South East, rising slow like
                  the ebon<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6988-00000051"/> form of night lifting its
                  gloomy brow up over the grave of day, told the experienced mariners what they
                  might expect.</p>
               <p>At last, the wind ceased to break. It was a dead calm. Lazily the sails flapped
                  against the masts, like the wings of a great bird which cannot rise from the earth
                  or sea. The schooner plunged and rolled upon the great dark waves, now high upon
                  their crests, then hurried in their shadowy gulfs. Albert was busy in loosing
                  spars and trimming the vessel for a more terrible contest with the king of storms
                  than yet she had seen on that eventful voyage. The crew urged on by their
                  knowledge of the danger, as well as by the orders of their officers, soon had her
                  stripped for light."</p>
               <p>Then, anxiously, but calmly they awaited the coming of the tempest.</p>
               <p>Albert descended for a few moments into the cabin to warn and cheer his father and
                  sister, and to prepare them unmoved to meet the coming danger. He found Isherwood
                  and Ada cheerfully conversing, and smiled as he observed it.</p>
               <p>"I'm not so hard a vilain, after all, am I?" said he to Isherwood.</p>
               <p>"Not beyond repentance, especially when you have such an angel as this to pray for
                  you!" said the mate casting a look of inexpressible tenderness," as willis would
                  say.</p>
               <p>"Well, you <emph>are</emph> getting along well. Do not think I am angry, I remove
                  my restriction, you remembered not forget her now. You remembered her in the hour
                  of her worst peril, you need not forget her when she is rate and happiness is
                  about to beam upon her path!"</p>
               <p>Albert now visited the room where Mary Whitelead was confined wishing to see how
                  she endured her trials. He found her once more calm, but pale and corpselike in
                  her very calmness. He spoke to her, spoke kindly, for bad as she was he could not
                  help pitying her. But she made no reply. Her long dark eye-lashes drooping down
                  upon her cheek, concealed the glances of her eyes—her lips, once so rosy, were
                  pale-her small white hands were clasped together. Had it not been for the heaving
                  of her bosom, he would have thought her dead.</p>
               <p>Again he spoke to her. She answered not with her lips, but she raised her dark
                  blue eye to his. There was no tear drop in them, nor did they flash with the light
                  of anger. So dark and mournful, so expressive, so subdued, that even
                     <emph>he</emph>, forgetful of what she was and what she had done,
                     <emph>pitied</emph> her!</p>
               <p>Again he spoke and his words were kind. She answered—</p>
               <p>"Have you come to lead me to execution. Albert?" she said in tones as low, sad and
                  thrilling as the moan of the dove which has lost its mate.</p>
               <p>He <emph>felt</emph> her looks and tone.</p>
               <p>"No lady I will not harm you!"</p>
               <p>"Why then am I bound like one ready to be led to slaughter?"</p>
               <p>"Lady, you shall be unbound—it was done because you offered violence to my sister
                  and would have slain her."</p>
               <p>"Albert, I care not for the bonds, I do not ask for life, it is worthless to me
                  now—I am willing to follow any father to a watery grave. Forgive me that I tried
                  to wrong your sister, it was hate caused by your slighting the love of one who
                  would have died for you. Forgive me, all that I ask now is death, death at
                     <emph>your</emph> hands for with my dying lips I'll bless you. Oh you knew not

                  your miles, and perished beneath your frowns. Forgive me—only give me death now, I
                  would die quickly, not linger with a broken heart:"</p>
               <p>"Lady do not speak of death. I am not so cruel as you think I am. All that I have
                  done stern justice and necessity bade me do? I would not, will not harm you—but a
                  storm is rising, I must go to my post of duty. You shall be unbound and
                  refreshments furnished you, (but until I am assured you do not intend hostility to
                  my sister, <choice>

                  the storm abates, I will see you again and do all that is in my power to make you
                  comfortable until I can set you free!"</p>
               <p>She did not reply, but as he went out she cast upon him another sad and tender
                  glance which seemed to look into his very soul.</p>
               <p>But the moment he left the room and closed the door, her looks changed quick as
                  the flash of anger from a sleeping tiger when aroused.</p>
               <p>"I'll have him yet in my toils!" she muttered. He has a <emph>heart</emph> left
                  within him yet and I will make it bleed. Never, <emph>never</emph> will I forgive
                  or forget him. No I can deceive, I can wear a mask as well as another! Oh how I
                  long to wreak my vengeance on him and his. I have thus far been foiled, but I have
                     <emph>not</emph> been conquered! If I live I will yet conquer <emph>him</emph>
                  if woman's art can do it!"</p>

               <p>WHEN Albert again reached the deck, although the day had dawned it was darker than
                  the night had been. A mass of clouds inky black had nearly mantled all the sky.
                  And still, like silent mourners moving with muffled tread toward the grave, up, up
                  they rose.</p>
               <p>And then a moan—a long deep moan as if some monster was in pain, was heard,
                  rolling over the deep.</p>
               <p>The crew heard it and old men who'd been reared upon the deep shuddered <choice>

                  vessel then headed, although she was drifting helplessly upon the waters.</p>
               <p>Albert ordered every sail taken in, ex-except the fore,
                     <unclear>storm-stay-sail</unclear> with which he wished to wear ship at the
                  first breath of the gale so as to get the craft before it.</p>
               <p>Again that wild, deep, sweeping earthquake mean louder, nearer came. It was the
                  voice of the Demon of the Storm warning its victims or knelling their doom.—Darker
                  and darker grew the sky. Then, far off, like a great wall of fleecy snow a white
                  range of lofty foam-waves came in sight. A moment more—they were close upon the
                  vessel, then with a hissing roar us if they were ten thousand serpents riding on
                  ten thousand hideous sea-monsters, on they came, fairly wrapping the vessel in
                  their fold: She quivered from stem to stern, from topmast-head to kelson! Her
                  lowermasts buckled like reeds in an autumnal gale, she fairly lay buried beneath
                  the weight of water and of wind!</p>
               <p>Then as the wild howl of the gale came seething through her rigging, as the black
                  clouds like devils on the wing just let loose from hell flow fast and wild above
                  her, she rose to the crest of a mountain wave. The staysail filled, her head
                  veered, a moment more and she was broadside on to the rolling seas. A wave lofty
                  as a mountain, looking like a snow-capped mountain rock hurled by a giant hand,
                  struck her. She was deluged—both masts went by the board; more than half her crew
                  were swept from the deck. It seemed as if all was lost But her head was veering,
                  Rudolph and Albert both were at the wheel, in an instant more she was before the
                  gale.</p>
               <p>And then at that dread moment, terrified not only at the turmoil of tempest and of
                  wave, Ada and her father rushed on deck. It was a terrible place for them, one so
                  old and feeble, the other so tender and to frail, but there they were, and both
                  rushed to Albert for protection. Leaving the helm to Rudolph, he was about to try
                  to lash them in some spot secure, so that they could not be washed overboard, when
                  Mary Whitelead rushed on deck, and with the sentinel, shouting that the vessel was
                  sinking. Isherwood too, so weak that he could scarcely stand came staggering
                  up.</p>
               <p>And, at that same dread moment, a dark mass was seen ahead rising and falling on
                  the waves, a moment more and they could see she was a steamship disabled, for her
                  machinery did not work. An American flag, Union down, was seen, a white bunge at
                  her foremast-head was lettered, U. S. MAIL S. S., PRESIDENT."</p>
               <p>In vain Albert seizing the helm tried to avert a collision; down, down driven like
                  an arrow from the gale the schooner bore upon the steamer. Shouts and cries were
                  useless waves or struggling to clutch at broken there, the storm drowned all
                  voices but its planks and spars. own.</p>

            <p>"Quintin Matsys; or The Blacksmith of Antwerp."—This is a tale of what is called the
               dark or middle age, dating from the beginning of the thirteenth century, when
               superstition and might were the only governing principles. At this time a society was
               formed to protect the weak against the strong, which was called "Fehm Gerichte," and
               the terror of that band was felt throughout Germany.—No person could commit a crime
               or plunder his neighbor, but retributive justice would overtake him. It is a truly

            <head type="sub">OR, THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER.</head>
            <head type="sub">By Eugene Sue. Price Fifty Cents.</head>
            <p>THIS is the latest of Sue's graphic and startling pictures of "Life" in the French
               metropolis. It is a faithful transcript of the foul, corrupt and heartless
               aristocracy which ruled Paris in the days of the old Regime, and of the ignorance,
               superstition and vices which naturally followed among the people. The story is
               admirably told, and like all of the works of its celebrated author, abounds in
               dramatic action and tragic interest. The characters are vividly drawn, and sustained
               throughout with striking fidelity. The portrait of ANATALE, a cold, specious,
               ambitions intriguer, for example, is rendered with an impressive faithfulness, which,
               once read, can never be obliterated from the memory. The character of the beautiful
               DIANE, is a brilliant yet melancholy likeness of the easy virtue which marked the
               female representatives of the proud, wealthy and corrupt upper classes of her day.
               The touching history of poor MARIA FAVEAU—a type of the fairer portion of the
                  <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Bourgeoise</foreign>—will be read with mournful interest.
               Affording as it does a vivid contrast between the morals of the upper and middling
               ranks, and the after want of protection which virtue, when allied to beauty, has in
               the French metropolis, against the lechery of aristocratic libertines. The work is
               destined to be widely read, and to create a sensation.—<title>Morning Star.</title>
            </p>
            <p>Sue has given us in the above powerful romance, another vivid and startling picture
               of the sufferings and struggles which aristocracies entail upon the people. The work
               abounds in incident, and is replete with interest from the opening chapter to the
               close. The characters are drawn and sustained throughout with spirit and fidelity.
               The action is rapid, and the story absorbingly intense. Rarely have we perused a
               volume which had for us so deep an interest. It fascinates the senses, like a
               beautiful woman, and gives the reader no rest till he has commented the story.</p>

            <head>THE MYSTERIES OF THE PEOPLE.</head>
            <p>IN the course of this great Romance, SUE, (while he adds much to the interest of the
               plot,) exposes the causes which drive so many THOUSANDS OF THE MEN OF PARIS TO

            <p>While it is entirely free from any offensive thoughts or language, it unveils the
               terrible social evils that are GANGRENING THE VERY HEART OF THE FRENCH SOCIETY.</p>
            <p>Never has genius conceived or described more interesting characters than those which
               impart to this story the animation of real life. The bold, handsome, but cruel and
               licentious Colonel de Plournel—the stern, frigid, jesuitical Cardinal—the lovely and
               virtuous daughter of the honest Linen Draper—the intrepid and worthy young Joiner—and
               the beautiful but guilty <unclear>Grisecte</unclear>, who receives in her white
               breast the ball aimed on her heroic lover on the barricades—are all faithful types of
               the various classes in the metropolis of France.</p>
            <p>So admirably written and full of interest, indeed, is this incomparable book, that
               all the vigilance of the French spies and police has been unable to prevent the

               one of the most striking pictures of serfdom ever drawn by human hand. The truth is

               <item>"This is another of the clever novels of the author of "Stories of Waterloo,"
                  and an exceedingly humorous tale it is. Irish life of the past generation is
                  pictured to the life, interspersed with anecdotes of well known men. Some
                  recollections are given of the Field of Waterloo, and the whole is dove-tailed
                  into an interesting narrative of the Parentage, Birth, Education, Exploits, and
                  amours of a gallant and dashing son of Erin. All who want to pass a dull evening,

            <p>THIS Capital Book is of the "Charles O Malley" school—full of dashing adventures,
               love intrigues, brilliant sketches of battle scenes, in which the inspiring headlong
               charge and terrible defeat are detailed with all the force of truth. The BIVOUAC
               belongs, as we have said, to a popular class of books, and we think it decidedly the
               very best of its class. We have not the space, though we have a strong inclination,
               to give our readers a taste of its quality—to reprint at length the matchless scene
               of the lover's meeting the fortune-teller in the gloom of the forest; the appalling
               interview and the grave-stories in the churchyard at midnight; the droll dialogues of
               the regimental mess-table; the eloquent description of the encampment of the rival
               armies; the fearful carnage of the battle-field; the prodigies of valor performed
               during the mountain combat; the richly-humorous "confessions of a gentleman who would
               have married if he could;" and a dozen other delineations marked in every page by
               some bold trait of wit or genius. The war-like descriptions will vie with the most
               animated scenes in Allison or Napier; and the humorous portions of the book have no
               peers but in the pages of Lever or Lover.—<title>Morning Star.</title>

            <p>THE BIVOUAC, OR RIVAL SUITORS, by Col. W. H. Maxwell, is one of those popular
               romances which are eagerly devoured by readers of fiction, and, in this in stance,
               without the deleterious influence which is too frequently attributed to much of the
               literature of the day. The "Bivouac" is a spirited, well-conceived and thrilling
               picture in the O'Malley style. The memoir of a ruined beauty, which occurs in the
               course of the story, is a touching exhibition of the extreme anguish which flattery
               and falsehood may inflict. Garrett &amp; Co., New York, have issued it in fair type
