            <head>PREFACE.</head> 
            <p>THE story of the "Beverly Family" was hastily written for a religious periodical, with no intention of giving it a publicity beyond the circulation of that paper. The object was to illustrate the influence of Christian gentleness, and the result of candid inquiry after religious truth.</p> 
            <p>Almost all the incidents of the story are real; and much that is given as the experience of the personages presented occurred with other persons and sometimes in other places than those mentioned. It was thought that some additional chapters could be given, with the view of developing the progress of conviction in the mind of one of the male characters, but it was with the author, as with his betters, he found it difficult to resume a subject that had once been dismissed from his mind.</p> 
            <p>No attempt was made to give to the story any attractions of a complicated plot, or to<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC6012-00000004"/> introduce any scenes of thrilling interest. Domestic life as it was found, and, with some changes, as it is still to be found, near the shores of the Chesapeake, was referred to rather than described.</p> 
            <p>The experiences of one or two persons in their search for truth is recorded of a single individual; and the results given are those to which his investigation lead.</p> 
            <p>That all who take the same course will arrive at the same conclusions is not supposeable; even without denying to all as great a willingness to accept the evidence as was felt by one whose experience is given.</p> 
            <p>Mrs. Beverly is introduced as a sketch of an existing person, and the anecdote of the visitation of her neighbors on a religious errand is a truth, with the exception of place and those little circumstances which were necessary to connect it with the other personages of the story.</p> 
            <p>The publisher thought he could make something out of the story in "book form," and, as he says, "could make useful to those that prefer narratives to essays." It is hoped that the first object, that of profit, may be attained by the publisher; and it is desired that the second anticipation may be realized.</p> 
             
            <p>If the little book should satisfy any that the graces of Christianity are necessary to domestic and social propriety, and thus induce even one to exercise that charity which is the essence of religion, the labor of writing the story-which was a labor of love-will have been more than paid for.</p> 
            <p>If the young should see in the friendship of Mary Beverly and Tucker and Millson something to admire, they will also notice that there was no straining for effect in the description.</p> 
            <p>And, in what a young lady, who has just read the story, calls the love scenes, it is intended to show, and to show by facts slightly varied, how vastly important to the happiness of domestic life, and to the end of all life, is that prudence which secures men and women from being unequally yoked. The slightest inequality may lead to disastrous consequences; and a mistake in forming matrimonial connections may be chargeable with results that reach beyond time. May it not be added, also, that difference in religious views need not disturb social relations. The very spirit of that religion upon whose dogmas there is a difference of opinion, is "peace, to men of good will," and apparently those best<pb n="viii-9" xml:id="VAC6012-00000005"/> illustrate the Christian creed, who excel in efforts "to bear and to forbear, to give and to forgive." Christianity is the purification of the worst, and the sanctification of the best feelings of the human heart; hostility should, therefore, cease among those who profess its holy doctrines, and then courtesy and kindness will be the characteristics of those who profess its sanctifying spirit. We may imagine too great tameness in the spirit of forbearance; but the effort to procure and maintain that forbearance is often greater than is the exertion that is necessary to proclaim and revenge an injury. "He that hath rule over his own spirit is greater than he that taketh a city."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
               <p>EDWARD S. BEVERLY was a native of Virginia, reared in that form of ease and luxury which distinguished the manners and customs of the people of the Old Dominion at the beginning of the present century. He inherited a considerable fortune from his father, and received a good education at Princeton, and returned to the home of his childhood to enter upon that mode of life which is not the best for the development and improvement of the human<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6012-00000006"/> mind. Some engagement called him across the Potomac River, or around it, and he spent nearly the whole of the winter of his twenty-second year in St. Mary's County, Maryland; where, without violating any of the probabilities of life, or disappointing the gossips near home-who all declared that "they knew it would be so"-he fell in love with a lady four years younger than himself, and as the colonel (we beg to say, that the military title was much earlier borne by our hero-how acquired we do not know, but "constitutionally" of course-at least in accordance with the resolutions of '98), as the colonel was good-looking, he was really a handsome man, as he was rich, and appropriately free in his expenditures, the lady, Miss Mary II. Hardy, who was of good family, handsome fortune, and handsome person, responded favorably to his proposition. The only objection heard in any quarter, excepting indeed from a few unmarried ladies around him, was founded on a difference of religion. The colonel, being a descendent of the old Cavaliers, prided himself on being an Episcopalian, and that pride stood him instead of many other modes of exhibiting his faith. He was a hearty keeper of Christmas; and all ideas of difference or difficulty between himself and wife ceased, when he learned that the Catholics were no contemners of Christmas holidays, though his pride was a little hurt when he learned that the very title of the holy season was derived from the Popish Sacrament. However, that was of little consequence, so that Christmas was not struck out.</p> 
               <p>A young Virginian is not a person to postpone beyond the narrowest limits of propriety the fulfilment of any design that promises to promote his happiness; and, as there was no grounds for delay on the other side, Easter week was scarcely over when St. Mary's County was convulsed with the news that Mary Hardy was to be married within a week. And next week saw the cortge proceeding along the "notched road" to St. Inigoe's Church, where the venerable pastor was arrayed in<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6012-00000007"/> "Alb and Stole," to perform that office which was a solemn, important ceremony to one party before him, and a holy sacrament to the other. The Church having performed her office and received her dues, there was nothing to be done but to <q>
                     <l>"Give to mirth her song, and sport her feather."</l>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>And the marriage is remembered by the elderly ladies of that county as one of unusual festivity and enjoyment, not marred at all by the presence of the priest, who seemed to think, and to have other people think also, that his blessing was as necessary to the bridal cake as to the bridal ceremony; and taking care, however, not to chill the becoming mirth of the season, he was always able to keep it within permissable bounds. Religion seldom appears more beautiful and attractive than when she pours her sunshine across the group of pleasure, and sanctifies by her approval, and gently restrains by her influence, the mirth and amusement of the young.</p> 
                
               <p>The good old Jesuit Father of St. Inigoe's well understanding all that, considered it a part of his holy office as much to approve by his venerable presence, the customary social rejoicing and junketting of his people, as to console the afflicted of his flock with the comfortings of his holy religion. With him rejoicings were apparently a part of his worship, and his worship was social. The old and young of St. Inigoe's knew when Father -- had an occasion of gratitude and thanksgiving, as they were sure to be called in to partake of the token of his thanksgiving. And none had cause of delight without making known to the beloved priest, not only the particular subject, but the time and mode of expressing it. His blessing was heard and felt at the bridal and the baptismal ceremony, and his consolatory voice was heard when sin and disgrace, and more frequent death brought affliction into the family. Grief, under such influences, soon put on the appearance of resignation, and mirth and thanksgiving assumed the form of gratitude to<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6012-00000008"/> God. How exceedingly lovely is that rural society where general competency abounds, and where a well-educated priest, understanding the character of his parishioners and the duties of his sacred office, spreads around him the influence of that religion which, while it sanctifies sorrow, and permits and blesses rejoicing on earth, prepares the professors for that state where change is only advancement in goodness and enjoyment!</p> 
               <p>It was not many days after the festivities of the marriage were concluded, that several large-sized barges were seen moving down the beautiful river of St. Mary; six fine-looking blacks plied the oars in each boat, and laid down to their work "with a will." It was a lovely morning, and the sun's bright rays shone upon the placid bosom of the river in silvery glory, or was flashed in beautiful gushes from the ripples which the barges caused. Point after point was passed, and handkerchiefs waved from the hands of the lovely companions of the departing bride; from the flag-staff near the residence of the priest hung the national ensign, with scarcely a fold spread out, so calm was the day; opposite a joyous group had assembled in front of the Fenwick mansion, to bid farewell, when suddenly a signal was given, and the leading barge headed towards the St. Inigoe's landing. On the extremity of the wharf or landing place was the good Father --. As the boat, the last but one, approached the shore, the motion of the little fleet was stopped, the hands of the priest was slowly elevated, his eye resting on heaven, whilst his lips were seen to move as if in prayer; every man bowed his head, and the bride, gathering up her dress, kneeled in the midst of the group which accompanied her, and scarcely audibly said, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Jube domine benedicere.</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>The eye of the priest fell slowly upon the lovely female kneeling before him. He had baptized her, he had taught her the Catechism, he had prepared her for Holy Communion and the Sacrament of Confirmation; and now that she was going away from his direct influence,<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6012-00000009"/> would she retain the integrity of her faith and the beauty of her example? He believed it, he hoped it; and so, signing the cross with his right hand, with a tremulous voice he said, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Benedicat te filia mea omnipotens Deus Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.</foreign> Amen."</p> 
               <p>The blessing of the priest seemed, like the spirit of his Master, to move upon the waters. A whisper seemed to die away upon the distant shore, and at that moment the Angelus bell of St. Inigoe pealed out its farewell sound.</p> 
               <p>"Good-b'ye, Father --," said Beverly.</p> 
               <p>"Good-b'ye, colonel," responded the priest, "and I wish you a pleasant voyage."</p> 
               <p>"Good-b'ye," said the younger portion of the company.</p> 
               <p>"Good-b'ye, my children."</p> 
               <p>The bride rose slowly from her kneeling posture, and cast a look at the clergyman, while her lips moved an inarticulate farewell.</p> 
               <p>And the kind blessing, which the priest breathed in response, were rather felt than heard by their lovely object.</p> 
                
               <p>"Give way," was the order, and the men at the oars, who had greatly enjoyed the scene, pulled their strongest, and soon rounding the point below, the beautiful shores of St. Mary's River were hidden from their view.</p> 
               <p>It is not the object of this narrative to enter closely into the life of Colonel Beverly and his lady. The difficulties arising from a difference of religion, especially with regard to children, which so many foresaw and expressed, were never experienced. Mrs. Beverly was in earnest in her religion; with her it was a vital influencing motive for which everything else was, if necessary, to be sacrificed-but which was never to be endangered by any untimely presentation of its salient points, or peculiar requirements.</p> 
               <p>She never argued with her husband as to the submission of their children to the ordinances of Catholicity until the children were born; and long before <emph>that</emph> she had by the beauty of her life and her unostentatious devotion, satisfied her husband that at least no harm could come from<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6012-00000010"/> these initiatory steps of Catholicity. And the wife soon found that the danger which she had to guard against was that indifference in her husband which, when he should become a father, would deprive her own lessons of the effect which his example ought to assist to procure.</p> 
               <p>Two sons received from Mrs. Beverly early instructions in Catholic doctrine. They died young: had they been spared it is probable that they would have, through much of their after life, adopted their father's indifferentism to all religion; and if spared to age, and saved from sudden death, would undoubtedly have been reconciled to the Church.</p>

               </cit> 
               <p>They were spared neither for sin nor repentance; they died before indifferentism had begun to undermine their creed and destroy their practice; and of them most truly it is said on their gravestones, "Of such is the kingdom of heaven."</p> 
                
               <p>The last child born, and the only one left to Colonel Beverly, was a daughter, whose name, according to Mrs. Beverly's wish, was to have been Elizabeth-but Colonel Beverly insisted that it should bear the name of the mother. In such a contest it was easy to see which party was to be victorious, so the child received at the baptismal font the name of Mary; and we may as well add, that when, in after years, she received confirmation, she adopted the name of Elizabeth.</p> 
               <p>A good domestic education with all the religious instruction, which Catholicity makes obligatory on an educated mother, was given to Mary; and she was taken to Georgetown by her father and mother, and left with many prayers by one parent and many hearty good wishes by the other.</p> 
               <p>Things had prospered with the colonel since his marriage. He had not speculated, he had not connected himself with trade, he held no office of profit, and the military commission by which his title came was of very doubtful existence. Yet<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6012-00000011"/> he was rich. His crops were large, his tobacco commanded the best price, because, first, it was good; and, secondly, it was always the first in the market. His wheat was always delivered according to contract; and his servants, of whom he had a large number, were cheerful, industrious, and healthful.</p> 
               <p>The colonel, when he found his gains increase, and his possessions augmented; his bank stock profitable, and his pocketbook supplied with numerous certificates of United States loans, really felt comfortable, and began to talk among his brother planters of the excellent plan which he had adopted to make his plantation profitable; and when called on at an agricultural meeting to make a speech and detail his plans and proceedings for the benefit of his neighbors, took the stand with great earnestness, and it was not until he had finished his exordium of thanks for the honor, that he recollected that he did not know exactly what it was that had produced such results. So he made an apt quotation from "Virgil," on Geoponics, and alluded to "Ruffin on Calcarious Manures," and pledged himself to respond to the call at the next meeting.</p> 
               <p>"It is very strange," said the colonel to his wife, "that I should be able to manage my farm better than my neighbors, as it appears by the results, and when those neighbors ask me to explain my mode of procedure, I should not be able to state it, and should have the appearance of wishing to conceal from them some scheme of farming, by which I was able to excel them in produce. I feel mortified. No Virginia farmer should be guilty of such narrowness. I feel mortified at being exposed to any suspicions of the kind."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Beverly remarked, that a man might be a very excellent planter without being able to speak extemporaneously.</p> 
               <p>"But," said the colonel, "no Virginia gentleman should be unable to make a speech."</p> 
               <p>"None I suppose is," replied the wife, "and you made a good speech, it was highly applauded-it was not what you<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6012-00000012"/> wanted to say, as is evident from your dissatisfaction, but it is what they wished to hear, as is proved by the applause you received. Besides you have pledged yourself to answer the questions propounded; that pledge you can redeem at the next meeting, and in the meantime you can make preparations for an excellent and instructive address."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Beverly explained to her husband the theory of his farming (men, it is known, often practice well without being able to present the exact plan or theory of their proceedings). She drew his attention to his mode of culture; to the selection of soil for different articles; to his choice of time for seeding, and to the selection of stock and seed, to the kindness and yet full authority with which the servants of all kinds were treated, and the great care given to their health; and she pointed out to him the means which he adopted to have his tobacco and grain of the quality represented, and also to be early in the market. Frequent repetition of these points made by Mrs. Beverly, only when her husband proposed some question upon the subject of his address, enabled the colonel to present himself at the annual meeting of the "Agricultural Society" with some confidence, manifested on the day of service by a modest avoidance of all reference to his forthcoming address, or a deprecation of any anticipation of instruction by the audience.</p> 
               <p>At noon, precisely, Major Belden introduced Colonel Beverly to the audience, in which were numerous ladies and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">lite</foreign> of the country.</p> 
               <p>The address was applauded. Colonel Beverly was pronounced a fit representative and exponent of the great interest of Eastern Virginia, and his wife retired from the hall proud of the applause which her husband had gained.</p> 
               <p>At the dinner, toasts were given and speeches made. The following was offered after the circulation of the wine: "The orator of the day, the true Virginian, who has improved the institutions and practices of his ancestors, by all the improvements<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6012-00000013"/> provements by which modern science does credit to past industry and talents."</p> 
               <p>There was a loud call of "Beverly!" "Beverly!" "Beverly!" The colonel rose, but he felt at once that he had not prepared for this speech. He knew that having succeeded so bravely in the address, much was expected from his table oratory.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen," said the colonel, looking as modest as he felt disturbed, "I thank you heartily for the toast just offered, and especially for the cordiality with which it has been received. I have, in addressing Viginia planters to-day, endeavored to show how Virginia planters may make the most of their present position, by improving on the past. I have referred to the advantage of change of seed, of careful culture, introduction of new implements, and of variety of stock. You, who have seen my farms, have seen that my address is less a statement of what may be done, than of what is done, and how it is done. That was the nature of the duty devolved on me by the Society. I have dealt candidly and faithfully with the subject, made known all the proceedings of those who superintend my farm, not a word of what I <emph>knew</emph> or believed concerning the plans and procedures should have been kept back; but immediately on leaving the rostrum, I became sensible of a deficiency in this respect, and I hasten to supply that lack, so that my experience may be made beneficial to my brother farmers. I make no confession, I decline no honors, but I express my own feelings and state my own case, when I ask you to unite with me in drinking the following toast:</p> 
               <p>"Our wives: the field, the factory, and the fireside owe their profit and their charms to woman's influence, and woman's influence is the least obvious and most effective when it comes from the wife of our bosom."</p> 
               <p>Three hearty cheers, three times repeated, showed the approval and appreciation of the toast.</p> 
               <p>A young gentleman, who was a guest,<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6012-00000014"/> perhaps from the North, awaited patiently the subsiding of the jubilation, and then, as if continuing the sentiment of the colonel, he said,</p> 
               <p>"The daughters of St. Mary's County, whose modest worth and houshold accomplishment make them as women blessings on either side of the Potomac, and both sides of Mason's and Dixon's line."</p> 
               <p>The old and young sprang to their feet, but another young man earnestly waived his hand for silence, and begged to amend the toast of his friend by adding as follows: "And <emph>their</emph> daughters, inheriting the good sense, and exhibiting the piety and purity of the brothers, they scatter blessings where they bestow affection."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Beverly said to the young gentleman who sat next to her, "I think the rule in England and perhaps in this country is that the ladies withdraw as soon as the toasts reach <emph>them;</emph> I'll thank you for your arm."</p> 
               <p>The ladies made a movement, and the gentlemen rose to remain standing while the ladies were withdrawing, but before the door was opened a gentleman from the adjoining county, who represented a district in Congress, said,</p> 
               <p>"Mr. President, I beg to offer an amendment to the amendment now before you in order-"</p> 
               <p>"An amendment to an amendment is in order," said the president.</p> 
               <p>"Then, sir, I desire to add-'and both mother and daughter, as retiring as they are lovely.'"</p> 
               <p>"To be drunk upon our knees," said a young guest.</p> 
               <p>"Too sober by an hour," said a senior. "Before the doors are opened let the toast be read as amended and drunk with all honors; it is as follows:</p> 
               <p>"The daughters of St. Mary's County, whose modest worth and household accomplishments make them, as wives, blessings on either side of the Potomac, and on both sides of Mason's and Dixon's line; and their daughters, inheriting the good sense and exhibiting the piety and purity of their mothers, they scatter blessings where they bestow affections, and both<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6012-00000015"/> mother and daughter, as retiring as they are lovely."</p> 
               <p>Full honor were done to the toast, and the Virginia ladies heartily joined the gentlemen in receiving and applauding the sentiment so complimentary to their companion.</p> 
               <p>Shortly after, Colonel Beverly rose and asked to be heard. "Mr. President and gentlemen," said he, "I am instructed by my wife, and no man, sir, receives instruction from that quarter more gratefully or follows it more obediently than I, I am instructed, sir, by Mrs. Beverly to ask the party to receive the following sentiment: 'The native mothers of Virginia-the Cornelias of the United States-while they point with just pride to their sons, their own jewels and the hope of the nation, they exercise their own hospitality, which has no comparison in Grecian or Roman customs, to make agreeable the residence among them of the daughters of other States."</p> 
               <p>Full honor was done to the toast, and enlarged applause, growing with the shortness ness of the afternoon, followed many other speeches and toasts which we have not space to copy, but which, the time and place considered, were not without interest or merit.</p> 
               <p>Time passed away, and with it many that had made delightful the society in Colonel Beverly's neighborhood. He had grown old with those that continued, but so gently moved all in his domestic affairs that he seemed to take no account of time. His whitened locks had been blanched by years, not sorrow; and his house seemed to others, as it seemed to him, a well-ordered paradise. He gradually saw how little of all its proprieties and his own opulence were due to his exertions; and without any sacrifice of self-respect he gradually yielded his perogative to one who seemed so capable of doing good, and so little capable of assuming the honor of the action in asking credit for its performance.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Beverly loved his wife-loved her even more than he did or the day he rowed down the St. Mary. And he recognized<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6012-00000016"/> cognized in her no diminution of that beauty with which he had been at first attracted to her-that had done its work-but day by day was there a revelation of some new charm, or repetition of some grateful act that begat new respect and created new attachments for his wife. He did not exactly comprehend, and therefore could not say, that he approved of all the ceremonies, fasts, and abstinences which she observed, but he had no doubt that they were consistent with her creed, about which he resolved and had resolved for many years, to make some inquiries when leisure should permit. Meantime, as Mrs. Beverly only asked that meat might not be served on Friday, in Lent and on Palm Sunday, he yielded to every thing, and finally asked that Fridays generally might be regarded as days of abstinence from meat in his whole family.</p> 
               <p>The excellence of Mrs. Beverly's character as wife, house-wife, mother, neighbor, and friend was such as to create a considerable fame for her, and to induce a few excellent ladies of different denominations to wish to redeem one so truly gifted from the errors of Romanism, for which they did not think she was entirely responsible as her own creed, inasmuch as it was the religion of her family and the neighborhood in which she was reared. These excellent ladies thought it proper to speak to Colonel Beverly about the propriety and practicability of such a movement.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6012-00000017"/> 
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <p>"ABOUT the propriety of your step," said the Colonel, "I am free to say that I see nothing wrong in it. I once thought it my duty <emph>to</emph> my wife and <emph>towards</emph> my daughter to make a few remarks on the same subject."</p> 
               <p>"And what was the answer?"</p> 
               <p>"That you shall know another time-of the propriety then you must judge. Now about the practicability of the step; can it be taken? Will it be well received? I think I can vouch for that. But I would suggest that, instead of coming over with the formality of a missionary company, you make arrangements some three or four of you to come and spend a few days with us; that will enable you to judge not merely of the effect of my wife's creed upon the family, but also of the best time to open your errand to her. Will Friend Needling, the Quaker's wife, come with you? I would suggest her presence; she is a plain spoken, but eminently gentle woman."</p> 
               <p>The suggestion of the colonel was well received, and it was afterwards remarked that the scheme which he formed was about the only plan, movement, or measure that he had ever withheld from his wife. He knew that it was due to the proposed visitors that his wife should have no hint of their intentions. It was due to his wife also that it should not be said that she had put her house or her mind in order to meet the ordeal.</p> 
               <p>On the Friday following, a carriage drew up at the residence of the colonel, and four ladies alighted and appeared to afford much satisfaction to Mrs. Beverly when they announced their intention of tarrying with her till the Tuesday following.</p> 
               <p>The eye of the mistress was abroad, and the servants felt and acknowledged<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6012-00000018"/> its influence, though they did not hear her voice. The ladies saw the daughter passing along the "quarters" of the domestics, often assisting in the distribution of the usual food and clothing, and looking after one or two sick and one wounded slave.</p> 
               <p>The household affairs went on as usual.</p> 
               <p>On Sunday, the ladies attended their own service in their respective chambers, excepting Mrs. Needling. She walked out to worship in "a house not made with hands," to contemplate God in his works, and to cultivate by meditation those graces in her own heart which she believed were fruits and evidences of Christianity.</p> 
               <p>Passing round among some of the quarters or dwellings of the servants, her attention was drawn towards a building which seemed not to be intended for a dwelling.</p> 
               <p>She approached and passed an open door, she saw the whole congregation of blacks kneeling with great apparent devoutness, while Mrs. Beverly was reading aloud the service of the Catholic Church, and her daughter Mary was leading a few of the servants in singing a portion. Suddenly all arose and Mrs. Beverly read aloud a portion of the first chapter of St. John's Gospel. Having finished that, she said, "This closes the Mass prayers, and morning service of the Church for to-day. In the afternoon about four o'clock your young mistress will assist you with your Catechism, and you who know it, should aid her with the children. Before we go, let us kneel and say a few 'Our Father's and Hail Mary's' for a blessing on your master and on the excellent ladies who are with us." All kneeled and all from the eldest to the youngest united in the prescribed services.</p> 
               <p>"In three weeks from to-day," said Mrs. Beverly, as she looked down upon her servants, whom she recognized also as brethren and sisters in the Lord, "in three weeks from to-day the Rev. Father Winslow will say Mass here. He will be here on the day previous to hear confessions. Let me hope that your young mistress and I may be accompanied to the<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6012-00000019"/> altar by many of you. You will make known to her or to me any little difficulty which you have with others or with your own mind, reserving all others for the priest. Meanwhile you will recollect that this is the Lord's day-a day of sanctified rest-any relaxation you may enjoy must be accompanied with a continued sense that you are accountable to God for the proper observance of this Sabbath."</p> 
               <p>The congregation rose and bowed low as "the old and young mistress" passed out, muttering as each passed the crowd, "Good-morning, Misses," "Good-morning, Miss Mary."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Needling found it convenient to leave the house soon after dinner, and it is said was much pleased not merely with the catechetical instruction at the schoolhouse chapel, but was gratified to notice that the services were not made irksome to the young by too great protraction.</p> 
               <p>The hospitality of Beverly Hall was appropriate to the character and sex of the visitors, the conversation was such as educated ladies, whose minds are touched with religious accountabilities, were likely to hold. The visit afforded pleasure to Mrs. Beverly, and she regretted when she learned that it would not be extended beyond the time first mentioned.</p> 
               <p>The dinner on Tuesday was served a little earlier than usual, so that the pleasures might not be curtailed by the necessity of saving time for the guests to reach their respective homes.</p> 
               <p>The guests rose from the table and retired to their rooms to prepare for departure; and in a short time it was announced to Mrs. Beverly that the ladies would like to see her and the colonel in the parlor.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Beverly knew that the Friends have customs different from others, and thought, perhaps, that Mrs. Needling wished to make some special remark with more formality than the customary intercourse of the parties would have warranted. She took the colonel's arm, and Mary followed her parents into the parlor.</p> 
               <p>"You are already to go," said Mrs. Beverly.</p> 
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6012-00000020"/> 
               <p>"Not yet," said Mrs. Needling, rising from her chair with a formality which showed that she was indeed about to assume a more formal tone.</p> 
               <p>"Mary Beverly," said Mrs. Needling, as she rested her hand upon the table at her side, "These friends that are with me, and others, thy neighbors and acquaintances, who have a knowledge of thy character, have felt exercised with regard to thy creed, believing without taking proper measures to acquaint thyself with what we believe to be the great danger of trusting to the formalities of thy Church, thou leanest on doctrines thou dost not pretend to understand; and we felt constrained to visit thee, and make known our views of thy errors; and, after prayer, to leave to God and thy good sense to finish the work which we hope to begin. We came not without thy husband's consent, and it is by his advice that we have given our errand the appearance of a social, neighborly visit--</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, Mary, but I will finish what I have to say, if thou pleasest.</p> 
                
               <p>"We came in the spirit of Christian love, I hope, and we have made our visit and its object the subject of constant prayer. We have watched our own hearts and conduct, and we have not been neglectful of thy practices here. We came to bear willing testimony to thy acceptability as a neighbor and friend, and to warn thee of the danger of thy creed. We have watched thee and thy household with care, and now I deem it my duty to say, that without any diminution of attachment to what we profess, we are constrained to say that thy practice as wife, mother and mistress, is such as would make us blush were we to speak against thy profession.</p> 
               <p>"Thou wilt, I hope, find no cause of offence in the object and manner of our visit. And if to thy delicacy there should be a little outrage in what appears to be a commendation of thy practices, thou wilt see that we could not leave thy house with the apparent falsehood of having come on social visitation only, and in confessing to thee the object of our call,<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6012-00000021"/> it becomes necessary to explain why we have not fulfilled our intention.</p> 
               <p>"And now, Mary, my dear friend, and neighbor, may God, thy God, who protected and guided thy fathers, and taught them to tolerate the creed and protect the persons of my ancestors, may our God and Father bless thee still in thy basket and store, in thy goings out and thy comings in; and if there be error in thy creed, may He pardon it for the loveliness of thy practice; and may thy beloved child live to be thy comfort and support, and to practice the faith that thy life illustrates, practice the virtues which make thee respected by all creeds, and inherit from thee the social and domestic virtues that lead women to have that affection for others that makes thee happy."</p> 
               <p>Before Mrs. Beverly could reply to Mrs. Needling, Mrs. Miles, the eldest of the other three visitors, said,</p> 
               <p>"Dear Mrs. Beverly, I am requested by my two friends here to say that we heartily concur in all that has been said by friend Needling, and if there has appeared anything unneighborly, indelicate, or unchristian in our visit or its object, we beg you to pardon it to us for purity of the motive in which it was undertaken. We shall probably hereafter be more disposed to omit any reference to the creed of our friends, and use any spare time which we may have for the correction of our own practice, in making it conform more and more to the teachings of Christianity."</p> 
               <p>"Neighbors and friends," said Mrs. Beverly, as, with streaming eyes, she kissed her departing guests, "I appreciate your motive in this visit, and thank you for the delicacy with which it has been conducted. I, of course, do not receive as my due the kind commendation which you have bestowed, but if you have found anything in my household, anything in the conduct of my daughter and me worthy of your approval, let me hope that you will believe that it is the effect of the religion which I profess, and which I try to practice; and if in my child you discover some Christian graces, do not be<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6012-00000022"/> offended if I, at least, impute them in some measure to the tenderness of her devotion to the Immaculate Mother of our Lord. Let us hope that we shall soon have a repetition of your visit; it has been most pleasant to me, aside even from the circumstances of its termination."</p> 
               <p>Farewells were exchanged. The ladies were placed in their carriage by the gallant colonel, who mounted his horse, insisting upon it, as a privilege of his place, that he should ride with them a mile or two and open and close the last gate upon the farm. As the colonel approached the carriage, after opening the last gate through which they had passed, Mrs. Needling said,</p> 
               <p>"Thou wast right, Edward, the four days' visit was necessary to a proper performance of the errand."</p> 
               <p>"And if in four days, ladies," said the colonel, "you have formed such an idea of Mrs. Beverly, what do you think must be my feeling towards her after nearly forty years' association?"</p> 
                
               <p>"And yet, colonel," said one of the ladies, "you have not allowed the beauty of Mrs. Beverly's practice to seduce you into an adoption of her creed."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not," said the colonel, "certainly not into a profession of her creed."</p> 
               <p>"Why, you do not believe the Roman Catholic doctrines?" said one of the ladies.</p> 
               <p>"So far as I know what they are, I do not disbelieve them. You know, I suppose, that we have only been taught rather negatives relative to the Catholics. I confess that I should not now like to hear it said that I should die so suddenly as not to be permitted to profess the Catholic doctrine."</p> 
               <p>"Then, friend Beverly," said Mrs. Needling, "let me say to thee, it is thy duty to profess it now; men may be good or bad in spite of creeds, but practical goodness, vital growth in piety seldom is found where there is not some fixed belief, and some sense of responsibility to creed in their practices."</p> 
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6012-00000023"/> 
               <p>The colonel bowed low; he knew it, he had felt it for two years at least, but he shrank from a practical use of the truth.</p> 
               <p>That evening the colonel had some call that, for the first time, kept him awake and out of bed at an unusual hour for him, and he happened to be in the room where his wife read the evening prayer for the family; and for the first time seemed to be one of those who worshipped. No notice was taken of the event by Mrs. Beverly, and the colonel renewed his visitations till his presence seemed almost a matter of course.</p> 
               <p>To a neighbor, who was spending the night with him, Colonel Beverly remarked by way of apology for having left him a short time to attend the family prayer, "It always seemed to me a proper thing for the head of a family to be present at the evening devotions, and of late I have, with regard to my servants, rather considered it as a duty not to be omitted. Example, you know, is a great thing with this class of people."</p> 
               <p>The guest nodded assent.</p> 
                
               <p>For several days there had been fearful bodings at Beverly Hall. Its lovely mistress lay sick, and the latest admission of the physician was that it could do no harm for her to see her spiritual adviser, and, as his visit would not regularly occur for some days, Doctor F-- admitted that it might be proper to send for him at once.</p> 
               <p>The servant then was despatched, and there was a long contest in the mind of Colonel Beverly as to the propriety of his leaving his wife in order to secure the earliest attendance of the priest-he could not go-and so he contented himself with such repetitions of his directions to his servants, and such alternatives for action in case of accidents-not finding the priest at home, or any other contretemps, that if the servant had not been a clear-headed fellow he would have been perfectly confused with his master's varied and contradictory directions.</p> 
               <p>"He will be sure to find him," said Mrs. Beverly to her husband, who was fearful of delay. "Father White has<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6012-00000024"/> duties as regular as those of the sun, and he is as regular in their discharge-John will certainly find him."</p> 
               <p>"But, my dear, the sun itself is part of the time absent in another hemisphere."</p> 
               <p>"But he is doing duty there, enlightening and blessing, and returns with the coming morn, and so will Father White."</p> 
               <p>It was not daylight when the carriage drove up to the door and the venerable, though not aged, priest alighted. After the exchange of a few words with members of the family, he was conducted to the chamber of the sufferer.</p> 
               <p>In a little while the sick woman, with her pallid face turned toward the priest, had poured out her soul to him as to God, and through him to God, and received that consolation which only religion, and religion through its authorized ministers, has to bestow on the suffering. The family were admitted, and kneeling, responded to the office which yet remained. Prayer and annointing had been administered, the rest was with God.</p> 
               <p>A gentle slumber followed the religious exercises, and the day passed as such days usually pass, when an affectionate family give up, hour after hour, hope after hope to which it had clung, and sees the growing certainty that the loved and the cherished, the object of veneration and affection is passing away.</p> 
               <p>Father White signified his intention of tarrying a few days. He foresaw the event that was at hand, and felt that his duty was there.</p> 
               <p>The next day Mrs. Beverly called for her daughter, and having spoken to her of the certainty of an immediate separation, she gave her advice and directions with regard to the management of domestic matters, for which her daughter had manifested special abilities.</p> 
               <p>"And now, my dear child, as I am about to leave you, bear in mind that I die as I have lived, in the faith of the Holy Roman Catholic Church. To me it has been an easy faith, for, though your dear father does not profess it; he has been not merely tolerant of, but even encouraging to, its exercises in the family; and<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6012-00000025"/> God has blessed him. When I am gone, yield no point of your creed, nor pretermit a grain of its practice. But, oh be careful never to offend others, and especially your dear father, by any obtrusion of your views, or any eccentric exhibition of religious requirements. You cannot conform to the customs of others, but you need not offend others by any untimely utterance or presentation of that part of our religious requirements which concerns our individual, rather than social duties.</p> 
               <p>"One word more, my child. Be careful how you yield to opportunities for the engagement of affections, but do not violate affections when engaged, unless a religious conscience should render it necessary. In marriage, try to be equally yoked; especially consult your religious attachment. I do not say that mixed marriages may not be productive of happiness, my own has been eminently so, but I do say that there is danger that strong convictions in the husband may tend to the opposite creed, and destroy the happiness of a loving wife. But do not think that, because a man is ranked with Catholics, that therefore he is best entitled to your affections. In such matters be prudent, be prayerful. Married life is honorable, is convenient; in most circumstances it is desirable, but our Church has many blessings for those who dedicate themselves, mind and body, to God. You, my daughter, have the care of your dear father, I know you love him for his own sake, but oh, love and cherish him for my sake! the lover of my youth, the kind, gentlemanly husband and gentlemanly friend, my protector; and in all the vicissitudes of life, in all the changes which years bring in looks, ever, ever the fond, constant admirer! oh, cherish him, yield to the peculiarities of his temper and character, never offend his feelings by unnecessary opposition, never wound his self-respect by any apparent want of dependence in his judgment. Do not neglect the religious, moral, and personal care of the servants, be, as I have tried to be, their friend as well as their mistress.</p> 
               <p>"Kneel down, my child, while I place<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6012-00000026"/> you once more under the protection of the Blessed Mother of God."</p> 
               <p>When the conversation ceased, Mrs. Beverly kissed affectionately her daughter and sunk away into a refreshing sleep.</p> 
               <p>That evening the attendant was dismissed from the chamber, and Colonel Beverly sat alone with his wife.</p> 
               <p>"Edward," said she, "you see that I am going, going fast. It is not meet, I know, that I advise you much, but take from my love what might not be agreeable if offered in any other spirit. Kindly, gently, my dear husband, have you dealt with me in all things, but most of all in my religious relations; with my dying breath I acknowledge that gentle forbearance, nay, more, that tender encouragement in the practice of my faith. May God, my dear husband, bless and reward you for all this goodness to me. One word, one request, only one. I do not ask you to be kind and forbearing to our dear child in her religious relations. I do not even request you to continue your kindness to the ministers of my religion; your good sense, your paternal affection, your gentlemanly principles and habits will continue all these, but let me urge upon you a profession of religious faith."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Beverly started--</p> 
               <p>"Nay, my dear husband, do not mistake me. I have never urged my own creed upon you. I have never asked, I scarcely now dare ask, you to become a Roman Catholic; though I have prayed, and do now pray God, for that; but do, my dear husband, do weigh the importance of religious convictions, and the benefit of spiritual responsibilities. Do not trust to the beauty of your blameless life, the kindness of your disposition, beware of indifferentism."</p> 
               <p>Colonel Beverly leaned over the bed and kissed his wife gently and fervently. "My beloved Mary," said he, "I promise you that I will think of all these things deeply, prayerfully, constantly."</p> 
               <p>"One word more, and I have done. You cannot have mistaken the intentions of both Henry Tucker and William Millson to Mary."</p> 
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6012-00000027"/> 
               <p>"Shall I," asked Colonel Beverly," shall I encourage Henry, who is both a relative and a Catholic?"</p> 
               <p>"Not on these accounts-I acknowledge the advantage of agreement in religious views between man and wife, and I feel particular anxiety for Mary on that account, because, my dear husband, how few will imitate your kindness."</p> 
               <p>"Dearest Mary," said the colonel, "how few, like you, can win the husband's attention beyond the lover's promise?"</p> 
               <p>"I will only ask that you seek to prevent any hasty conclusion by our daughter. Even conformity of religious creed does not make similarity of tastes and views, and harmony of feeling on subjects not directly concerned in religious exercises."</p> 
               <p>"Spare yourself, my dear wife, the exertion. I understand you. I will in all these matters direct our daughter to your own views."</p> 
               <p>It was a lovely morning in the month of June, that season when all nature presents herself with tokens of perfection, but without a sign of decay; fields were rich in grain and grass, and trees were luxurious in foliage arid smiling fruit. A soft early light rested upon the lawn that slanted away from the house, and the ripples of a distant water danced in the beams of the rising sun. All without told of life, and light, and joy. Within the house of Colonel Beverly, sorrow and fearful awaiting was seen. A soul, the breath of the Almighty, the redeemed of His coequal Son, was passing away from the world. The agony of suspense restrained tears, and the gentle voice of the priest as he suggested ejaculation, or soothed fear, or sought to direct a groan to a prayer, was all that mingled with the words and breathing of the departing.</p> 
               <p>Kneeling at the bedside was the servant of God, with the husband and daughter, and beyond them were members of the family. The breathing grew shorter and shorter; one effort seemed to cost life itself; over the lips of the dying there seemed to pass, fading away into inaudibility, the words, "Jesus-Mary."</p> 
               <p>A gentle breeze ruffled the curtain of<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6012-00000028"/> the window, a sunbeam lay light and lovely upon the placid face of the dead.</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Suscipientes te Christus qui vocavit te,</foreign>" breathed the priest, as he first looked down on the object of his ministrations.</p> 
               <p>There was sorrow in Beverly Hall, for one had passed away whose whole life, in all its relations, had been governed by the law of Christian love; and who had the blessing, too, of making those around her appreciate the motive and approve the spirit in which she discharged her duties.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Beverly tried to bear his affliction like a man, but he was compelled to feel them as a man. "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away," said he. "None but God could give such a woman, for none but for heavenly communion could she have been withdrawn." He was not yet prepared to bless the name of the Lord.</p> 
               <p>Kind friends assisted in the house of mourning, and on the third day Solemn Mass was said in the state-hall of the mansion, and Father White preached a short funeral discourse, one or two sentences tences of which were repeated by the mourning friends.</p> 
               <p>After alluding to the virtues of the dead, as a wife, mother, and friend, and to her care as mistress, for the immortal interests of her servants, he remarked-"I discharge the duties of my office when I offer thus the holy sacrifice, but I have no hesitancy in saying that, so far as regards our sister who lies before us here, I consider this solemn office as one of supererogation-doubtless, to me, the soul of the deceased has passed upward to enjoyment. My life has been spent amid the painful duties of the priesthood, and in seeking to understand and direct the religious affections of my kind; and I may be allowed to say that never have I been brought in contact with a mind so pure, so heavenly, so above selfishness, and yet so full of dread of offending by commission or omission, as I have found that of our deceased friend. What frailties she may have had which escaped her own detection I know not, God alone knows, but so far as I can judge they must, if existing at all, have<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6012-00000029"/> been like spots upon the sun, lost in the splendor and beauty that surround them."</p> 
               <p>A gentle, most delicate monition was given to the survivors, and when the service was closed, the long train, all mourners, followed the body to a distant elevation, which had been selected and consecrated as a family burying-ground; and there, beside her two sons, they laid the body of Mary Beverly, who, in childhood, youth, and womanhood, in all the relations of daughter, friend, wife, and mother, exhibited the best qualities of the female sex, and the best influence of the Catholic religion.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <p>THE domestic affairs that had passed into the hands of Mary Beverly by the sickness and death of her mother were well administered. There was care, there was work, there was constant responsibility-these all were well and fully met; and, while passing, we may as well say that it is a mistaken idea of our Eastern friends, that females at the South have little or nothing to do, because they have so many servants to obey them. How little do those who thus imagine think of the care, attention, watchfulness necessary to make those servants comfortable and profitable. How necessary is the attention of their master in the field, how requisite the constant care of their mistress to deal out to them their food, and prepare and supply their clothing, to look after their cleanliness and health,<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6012-00000030"/> and see that their work is properly distributed and performed, and that their allowances are justly apportioned; and besides these, beside the care of a sick bed, the mistress of such a family has a high moral and religious accountability-and well did Mary, following the example of her sainted mother, respond to all the responsibilities of her new condition.</p> 
               <p>Meantime the partiality, almost the rivalry, which Mrs. Beverly had seen in Henry Tucker and William Millson for her daughter, became more manifest to the father, and perhaps to Mary, though she certainly appeared to be unconscious of such rivalry; of any attachment, in deed, beyond that of intimate friends and distant relations.</p> 
               <p>Millson, who was, as had been Colonel Beverly in his day, rather indifferent on religious grounds, though far superior to him in gifts and attainments, felt the great advantage which Tucker had in the circumstance of having been baptized and reared a Catholic.</p> 
               <p>Tucker felt some confidence in his relationship tionship and familiarity, and he distrusted his claim on the ground of religion, but determined that such as they were, they should not be neglected.</p> 
               <p>Notice was given in the vicinity that on the second day of July there would be at Beverly Hall, a religious exercise of "<hi rend="i"/>a Month's Mind of the late Mrs. Beverly." The custom of holding a commemoration of the dead is one that is old, but not universal, among Roman Catholics. Where it is practiced, a neglect would be construed into either coldness towards religious services, or indifference towards the deceased.</p> 
               <p>At sunrise on the 2d of July, 185-, the chief room of Beverly Hall presented much of the appearance of a consecrated chapel, and every chair that could be placed within its walls was occupied by members of the family, or neighbors come to share in, and witness the services. The Solemn Mass for the dead was offered, and when the "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Domine non sum dignus</foreign>" had been thrice uttered, Mary Beverly was conducted to the temporary railing<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6012-00000031"/> by her father, on the left hand, and her relative, Henry Tucker, on the right; a few others of the friends of the family approached the altar, and then the vacant places were filled by the colored servants, who had been taught to feel and exercise that lofty equality which places father and child, king and peasant, master and servant, on the same footing before God in the use of the sacraments of the altar.</p> 
               <p>Henry Tucker, to the surprise of all the visitors, received the Sacrament. The company, not fully understanding the customs of the Church, had supposed that he and Colonel Beverly had gone to the altar to assist Mary. When Mary had received the Sacrament there was a loud breathing of wonder in the room, for the priest passed in front of Colonel Beverly, and said with something more of emphasis than he had before used, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Corpus domini nostri Jesu Christi;</foreign>" and having placed in the colonel's mouth the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, he added, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Custodait animam tuam in vitam ternam.</foreign> Amen."</p> 
               <p>The remainder of the servants, who had been prepared for the Holy Communion, approached the railing as the first retired. The priest concluded his sacred office, and the congregation dispersed through the house and premises.</p> 
               <p>Astonished, as many were, that Colonel Beverly had become a Catholic, none were so indelicate as to remark upon it. He had seen that if he allowed that occasion to pass, he might, if spared, relapse into indifferentism; while if he assumed the responsibility of profession, he placed himself within that spiritual and self-discipline, so essential to the preservation of the Christian character and the honor of the Christian profession. The proposition was from him, not from his daughter or the priest. The comfort was for all. Without any zeal or earnestness, Colonel Beverly lived the life of a devoted, humble son of the Catholic Church, and added to the credit which the faith had already acquired in his household.</p> 
               <p>There was not wanting some who saw in the new devotion of Henry Tucker, an attempt to win favor of Mary Beverly;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6012-00000032"/> and one of the young gentlemen who was present at the celebration, remarked a few days afterward to William Millson, that "Tucker had, by going to communion, made a bold bid for Mary's hand."</p> 
               <p>"You have made three mistakes in that," said William. "In the first place, you greatly err if you imagine that Mary Beverly could be caught by what you suppose the hypocrisy of such a movement; or, that any one who enjoys her acquaintance as closely as Tucker does, would have any such poor opinion of her estimation or discernment.</p> 
               <p>"In the second place, you mistake immensely the character of Henry Tucker, if you suppose him capable of the least hypocrisy or indirect dealing, to obtain the wealth and hand of even Mary Beverly.</p> 
               <p>"And, thirdly, you mistake monstrously if you imagine, whatever may be my feelings towards that lady, whatever her preference may be for Tucker, that I should feel the least gratification in hearing his motives impugned in such a solemnity, such an august mystery, as the Roman Catholics believe the Sacrament of the altar. I do not choose in any company, to speak of Miss Beverly; but I request you to remember, here, that Henry Tucker is my friend."</p> 
               <p>Both Tucker and Millson were frequent visitors to Beverly Hall. It was a duty towards the colonel, it was respectful towards his motherless daughter. After some conversation with the colonel, one morning, in which family matters were discussed and offers of personal assistance made and declined, Tucker said to Millson, the colonel having withdrawn, "This may be the fit opportunity for the fulfilment of our resolution to make a visit to Europe."</p> 
               <p>"But neither of us, I think, <emph>you</emph> certainly, will not feel anxious to be absent from Beverly Hall for so long a time as a tour of Europe would require."</p> 
               <p>"The travelling in Europe is now so rapid, that we need not spend much time in passing from city to city, and the voyage across the Atlantic so short and pleasant, that we need not be afraid to<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6012-00000033"/> repeat it, if our short visit should lead to a desire to renew our transatlantic researches."</p> 
               <p>And so, the next evening, the plan was made known to, and approved by the inmates of Beverly Hall; not the less that some pecuniary business seemed to call for the personal attention of Tucker in the south of Ireland, of which his mother or grandmother was a native.</p> 
               <p>"I should almost envy you your pleasure in Italy," said Mary, "if I had not duties here whose discharge becomes a pleasure to me, especially those directly to my father, and also those towards our large family; and the approval of my domestic management by my father, makes each day's labor a delight. But we shall hear from you."</p> 
               <p>"Will you allow me," said Tucker, "to address a few letters to you while I am abroad?"</p> 
               <p>"You are very kind, Cousin Henry; I shall read with delight anything which you may send, but as I read all my father's letters, and answer most of them, it will be most appropriate to address your epistles to him, and we shall consider them as intended for us all."</p> 
               <p>In a few days, the travellers presented themselves at Beverly Hall to take leave of the colonel and his daughter, and the few female relatives that were guests, almost residents, there.</p> 
               <p>"Cousin Henry," said Mary, "I have a farewell present, for you, and I am sure you will not think lightly of it, even for my sake. A small 'blessed medal' is enclosed in this piece of leather, put it into your pocket now, and when you change your dress place the string around your neck; one or two prayers a day, connected with the medal, may not be of disservice; older men than you have worn such things, and thought they derived advantages from the prayers they required, and the reflections they suggested."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Cousin Mary; it shall be carefully worn, and its suggestions followed."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Millson, I must not bid you farewell<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6012-00000034"/> well without adding my heartfelt wishes for your health and happiness during your absence, and for your early return. I am sure that I express papa's feelings and mine, when I express thanks to you and Cousin Henry for attentions during the sickness of my mother, and your kind visits and services since."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you for your kind wishes, Miss Beverly, and I shall remember them in my absence. But you have made my pleasure quite too dependent on my companion, by conferring on him the medal, which will remind us both of the giver, as well as the object of the gift."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! we poor papists do not think it expedient to scatter our bits of idolatry among those who will not appreciate their use."</p> 
               <p>"Let me say, in behalf of my side of the house, that we are no iconoclasts, and I, at least, can never think lightly of any object, however intrinsically valueless, that is consecrated to the suggestions of reverential recollections of the good, and of prayers that have their first record in the Scripture. It is not always the gift, so much as the giver, that awakens thoughts of devotion; but the gift that has devotion for its object, must be respected by all."</p> 
               <p>"Then, Mr. Millson, take <emph>my</emph> medal; it has been used, but it may still bless; not the medal, itself, but by thoughts which it may inspire. It was used, with some others, by my mother; and on that account will, I know, be prized by you."</p> 
               <p>"On all accounts," said Millson.</p> 
               <p>It is not our intention to follow Tucker and Millson through their European visit, It was hastily made, but much was seen, and seen as gentlemen see; nothing was condemned merely because it differed from what they had been accustomed to at home. The evils which they saw they imputed to the circumstances in which they originated, and while they saw the oppression which bad governments were producing, they did not fail to notice that hasty attempts to correct that cause of suffering were likely to multiply the evils, by transferring power from the half-sated<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6012-00000035"/> to the hungry bad; great as was the misdoing of those who held power, they were not the only ones who would oppress the people if an opportunity should present to try the untried.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Beverly received many letters from his two friends abroad, and it was evident that neither wrote aught which it was desirable that Mary should not read. Many of these letters are still extant, and are treasured with great care and affection by the present holders. From one or two we shall, hereafter, make extracts.</p> 
               <p>The property in which Tucker claimed an interest, was in the neighborhood of Killarney, Ireland; and the letters which were written from that point show much discrimination on the part of the writer. We take up one written from Rome, by Tucker, and copy the following paragraphs:</p> 
               <p>"We have stood in the shadows of the Coliseum, and walked beneath the Arches of Titus and Constantine. We have descended into the dungeon of the Mamican Prison, where Peter and Paul suffered and preached. We have wandered among the ruins of the Bath of Caracalla, and been in the Columbiarum opposite. We have stood in the shadow of the Pyramid of Cestus, and gazed upon the imperishable walls and dome of the Pantheon. St. Peter's, the Vatican, St. John Lateran, and St. Mary Maggiore, have displayed their wonders to us, and we have felt the awe such grandeur is sure to excite in all; but, neither my companion nor I, feel disposed to attempt description when, for a scudo, we can purchase a book describing them all; and with the next bundle forwarded, you will find some of the best descriptions and illustrations of Rome that could be given.</p> 
               <p>"But, last Sunday, having attended Mass in the morning, and, more, I fear, at least on my own part, from curiosity than devotion, heard several masses, we set forth, after an early dinner, to see what were the services and customs of Rome on Sunday afternoon. Our first visit was to a church near some public fountain. This is an old, large church; it was filled, but<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6012-00000036"/> filled with children who were receiving lessons derivable from the Catechisms of our Church, and seemed devoutly engaged in whatever was suggested to them by the priests at the head of each class.</p> 
               <p>"Returning, we stopped at the Church of St. Carlos, I think it is the property of the French, and is situated on the Corso. There, the Vespers followed instruction to a class of young men, and I was somewhat surprised to notice that they were part of the French military force stationed in the Eternal City. It was peculiarly gratifying to find French soldiers thus occupied, and I did not fail to call the attention of Millson to the fact, not, as you know, that he is capable of small prejudices, but that he might bear testimony to the fact that our Church is careful of the interests of all that may be called her children, and that in no honorable pursuit in life do Catholics forget, or entirely neglect, their religious duties.</p> 
               <p>"We have breakfasted with Cardinal Franzoni, and are, to-morrow, to be presented to the Holy Father. You can understand derstand our feelings in anticipation of that interview, which will take place, not in the Vatican, but at the Quirinal Palace, the summer residence of his Holiness."</p> 
               <p>We add part of a letter written by Mr. Millson, to a member of his own family.</p> 
               <p>"My former letters will have informed you of my movements previous to my arrival in Rome. We reached this city, Rome-ancient Rome and modern Rome-it is both-some days since, and having established ourselves at the Hotel d'Angleterre, we sallied forth to see Rome, placing ourselves for the day in the hands of a valet-de-place, as we had done in other cities. Of course, every ruin, every edifice, every object which we saw, was just what other people saw-but how much depends upon the stand-point of observation! how much upon the temper, preparation, and peculiar feeling of the observer!"</p> 
               <p>"Do you not remember dear --, that in some conversation with our estimable friend, a few days before my departure from home, he said, 'Well, William, Iam<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6012-00000037"/> glad you are going to Italy. The peculiar character of your mind, your strong feelings on what you regard as religious intolerance, and your determination to arise above the prejudices that surround you, have, with another cause (a cause worthy yourself and talents), given you a strong proclivity towards the Roman Catholic, against which a wicked, mischievous prejudice prevails-and as you see the evil of that prejudice, and the wrong which it inflicts, you almost naturally take sides with the oppressed, and allow your feelings for the wronged persons to mislead your judgment with regard to doctrines-and, let me add, with regard to <emph>practices</emph>-for Catholicity in the United States, hemmed in as it is by watchful societies, and deprived of the means of arbitrary power, is not what it would be, is not what it is elsewhere, not what it will be whenever it shall gain power here. Let me add, "<hi rend="i"/>he who would not be a Roman Catholic let him go to Rome." It is an old saying, and though it seems to be contradicted by some recent occurrences, yet a person with so little uncontrollable enthusiasm as yourself will, on reaching Rome, at once distinguish between the apparent and the real, between the piety of the oppressed, who have never known other modes of faith, and the heartless faithlessness of the learned and the great, who hold power by the chains of superstition, and retain place by ceremonious display to those whom they keep in ignorance. Go, therefore, to Rome, and learn the reason why you cannot be a Roman.'</p> 
               <p>"Such my dear --, was the language of one whom from my infancy I have esteemed, such the direction of one to whom I had opened my heart and confessed some of my convictions of the truth of the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. He had in private uttered nearly the same sentiments to me, and my determination was not to commit myself to any Church beyond those relations, which by family connection I already hold, until I should have gone to Rome as he suggested.</p> 
               <p>"Let me give to you some of the minutes of my diary, into which I had resolved<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6012-00000038"/> solved to pour my thoughts day by day, just as the events of that day suggested, and to wait for the corrections and suggestions of a future day.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sunday-Attended the <hi rend="i"/>Gesu, the principal church of the Jesuits. High Mass-the people kneeling, but it appeared to me that the people did not comprehend what was being transacted at the altar. So I left before the conclusion of the service, and learned that I lost an able sermon; <emph>that</emph> loss, I find, can be supplied. Returning, I took in my way the Coliseum. Not even this massive pile, I see, is left to the recollections of the past; but bigotry, or weakness, has erected around the interior of its vast arena, religious emblems, which, I learn, are representations of the Passion of Christ, and services are performed in front of each on almost every holiday. This service, is in English, called the 'Stations of the Cross.' Piety, I think, might have found a less ostentatious mode of exercise.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sunday evening-I have spent most of the afternoon in sight-seeing, with Tucker, who makes his genuflections at the churches with most Roman propriety, and then pursues his researches around the walls among the pagan antiquities, with most American curiosity. Yet how beautifully consistent is he, in faith and practice! It is much (almost even if in error) to feel established as he feels, and to admit all, for the sake of a part that he thinks must be admitted. But I will not admit anything without proof; and I begin to see that one is never less a Roman than when in Rome!</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Monday evening-We called to-day at the Irish College, and delivered to the president of that institution two letters which Tucker took with him, one from high religious authority, and one from a layman known to, and loved by, the president of the institution. There is an amount of sound attainment, classical reading, and scientific knowledge in this meek-looking man, that seemed to be in strange contrast with the humility of his deportment, and his devotion to the minutest forms of religion, his anxiety<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6012-00000039"/> to lift the doubting out of his difficulty, and to assist the believer in his work of piety-I have never been more struck with the contrast of these attainments and qualities in any man than in him.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Thursday evening.-The dinner to-day at Cardinal F--'s was one that was truly elegant. I should think, however, that the meats served up in Old Virginia, for the same number of persons, would have answered for at least a dozen such feasts as this-and yet how ample! how gracefully each course followed its predecessor, and how the conversation was varied to suit the circumstances and peculiarities of each guest! I find that I have little or no difficulty in understanding the Italian spoken by gentlemen of education-it is the street patois which annoys me. Surely there is piety sanctifying the vast knowledge of his Eminence, and manifested in the conversation of his Roman guests. I think I heard less of cant terms than I have elsewhere listened to-but certainly there appeared to be a constant recognition of the necessity of 'vital religion,' that is, grace in the heart-perhaps too much dependent upon machinery, I think so much as to conceal, perhaps exclude, the former. <emph>Let me look closely to that.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"We have plenty of servants in Virginia, but few really to serve. Here the proprieties of the house are understood and administered by men who, having assumed the duties of servants, are conscientious, I think, in discharging those duties. Remember to tell Cousin B-- about this, it will make her take the servants through the manual.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sunday afternoon.-This has been a busy and a most remarkable day, so far. I listened this morning, with deep anxiety, to the service at the Gesu; the name of the father who preached has escaped me, but not his sermon. Was he aiming his discourse at <emph>me,</emph> in particular! It cannot be. How should he know I was in Rome? or, knowing that, from others, how should he have known that I was to be at the Gesu this morning? Certainly that plainness of the preaching (not the argument),<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6012-00000040"/> removed strong doubts I had. Leaving the church, at an hour much too early for dinner, we strayed away to the Irish College; and, finding the president at home, we had some pleasing conversation, and, while Tucker had gone into Professor S--'s chamber, the president referred to that part of my conversation which related to the Jesuit's sermon,</p> 
               <p>"'You are exercised in your mind,' said he, 'you are inquiring, and you tell me that you have yet some weeks in Rome. Let me ask you to form no rash conclusions, weigh well all suggestions, but remember the infinite importance of judging correctly, now that you have determined to examine the testimony. And, my dear friend, as nothing can be done without the grace of God to assist, let us both kneel down and recite three "Our Fathers" for the benefit of your inquiry.'</p> 
               <p>"How powerfully persuasive is that man, Yet he has attempted no argument with me, said nothing beyond a simple answer to my interrogatives. I kneeled with him, and I had scarcely wiped the brickdust from my knees, when Tucker returned.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sunday evening.-We had wandered among the ruins in the vicinity of the Temple of Vesta, and looked down into the Roman Forum, passed under the arch of Titus, and found ourselves where we really intended to be, in full sight of the Coliseum. We loved to make <emph>that</emph> a point in all our visits to places beyond the Capital.</p> 
               <p>"On entering the immense edifice, we found a large number of persons following an ecclesiastic from point to point, or rather from picture and carving to picture and carving, and repeating and chanting a sort of Litany. It was near its close when we approached, but on listening, I found that it was that service which you will recollect we once attended at Beverly Hall, and which is called the 'Stations of the Cross.' Does the Catholic faith make people look alike? I saw in this crowd not only the exact movements, kneelings, bowing, etc., but really I thought I saw in the face and persons of the devotees<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6012-00000041"/> resemblances to the family of the colonel and the little congregation that was wont to gather in the <emph>Chapel,</emph> in his house. Excepting, indeed, one-I saw nothing that looked like her.</p> 
               <p>"When the ecclesiastic had concluded his service of 'the Stations,' he ascended a small rostrum and addressed a congregation of several hundred, many of whom had assisted in 'the Stations.' His text was 'Bring forth, therefore, fruits worthy of penance.'</p> 
               <p>"The preacher was tall and thin, his dress was that of a Franciscan monk, a grayish cloak or gown tied around his body with a cord, sandaled feet and, on this occasion, his cowl or hood turned back from his shaven head.</p> 
               <p>"The exordium was neat and appropriate, but it was of that formality, and work-like temper, which constitutes the ground of complaint by Protestants against the Catholics. Still, I had before me an exponent of Catholicity, speaking to Catholics; and on a subject, at that moment, most interesting to me; so I resolved solved to abide the services, long or short, and judge the preacher and his creed by his exposition.</p> 
               <p>"'Let us understand,' said the monk, as he passed from the exordium, and turned his large black eyes down upon his audience,'let us understand what are the works meet for penance.' And he spoke of charity, of gentle temper, of forbearance and forgiveness. 'But penance,' said the monk, pausing again, 'penance is only the token and consequence of repentance, and by <emph>metonomy</emph> the words are changed. It is the motive not the act, it is the grace in the heart, not the benefit of the work; you may deceive your fellowman by action, by the profession of repentance for faults committed towards him, but you cannot deceive God. You may come to the tribunal of penance to keep up an appearance of piety, or in conformity with an excellent habit; and you may confess and receive absolution from the priest, but these add nothing to your merit unless they are preceded by that grace of compunction and repentance<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6012-00000042"/> which shall be the motive for confession, and that resolution for forsaking the sin and making restitution for the wrong, which shall give efficacy to absolution. Without these, my brethren, confession is a repetition of sin, and the absolution of the priest is entirely inefficacious.'</p> 
               <p>"Never, never, did I hear deep sorrow, hearty repentance, so dwelt on as a necessity of salvation, as by that monk. As he illustrated his simple argument, the faces of his audience brightened with approval, and the vast mass swayed backward and forward as the orator stretched forth or withdrew his arms. As I turned from the rostrum at the close of the discourse, a person, having on the cloak and hood of a Franciscan, with his face covered entirely by the cowl, so that he was dependent upon three small holes in the cloth for sight and breath, approached me with a small box and asked alms; his dress did indeed denote poverty, but the little foot neatly booted, and the delicate hand that extended beyond the sleeve of the habit told of wealth and gentility.</p> 
                
               <p>"'To whom shall I give? to you?-Pardon me, I am a stranger here.'</p> 
               <p>"'No, I am one of a confraternity that maintains this mission in the Coliseum, and sustains an hospital on the hill yonder.'</p> 
               <p>"'And do you maintain, in the hospital yonder, any others than Catholics?'</p> 
               <p>"'We never make anything but suffering and our ability a test; although, you may well suppose, that any religious service there is of the Catholic prescription.'</p> 
               <p>"I thanked the solicitor and made my offering, and retired. This has been a day of importance. Is the religion preached at the Gesu, and that just promulgated in the Coliseum, the Roman Catholic doctrine? Is this what I have heard of priestly power? And here I am in Rome, where no deception would be practiced in such matters. And the great essentials of Christian regeneration are made the fundamental doctrines of the Church. Have I mistaken? But I will take President K--'s advice, and make no rash conclusions.</p> 
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6012-00000043"/> 
               <p>"Tucker has evidently seen the effect of the morning's and evening's sermon on my mind, but with a delicacy that is worthy his character, has forborne remark. Tucker cannot assuredly be influenced by lower motives. No! no! no! I have never found him less than a Christian gentleman-but, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">amor omnia vincit</foreign>-has it conquered <emph>all?</emph>"</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <p>THE daily record of what was seen, and heard, and considered, is deeply interesting to one who loves to trace the operations of the human mind. At one time the writer seemed to have opened his heart to embrace the Catholic religion, and the next day doubts occur, old feelings are strengthened by some scandal, or some unexplained circumstance; but on the whole the tendencies are towards the Church. Constant petty revolutions mark certain classes of sentiment in his mind; but the whole seemed to verge on towards Catholicity, just as it is said that the solar system has, year by year, to revolve round the central planet, while all, centre and circumference, are trending away towards the constellation of Hercules.</p> 
               <p>On the Sunday following, the two Virginians were, by arrangement through the<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6012-00000044"/> President of the Irish College, to have an audience with the Pope. They presented themselves at the Quirinal Palace, and were conducted to a beautiful summer house at the foot of the elegant gardens. There they found others awaiting similar honors. The names of our friends were purposely placed at the foot of the list, as that list was not long, and at length they were called, and waiting a moment in the immediate ante-chamber, they had some conversation with Prince Hohenlohe, the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">prelate</foreign> in attendance.</p> 
               <p>We copy now from the note's of Millson:</p> 
               <p>"I did not see the Pope as I entered, but I heard a voice as we approached him, and I think I never heard so much of sweetness in human tones. Having resolved not to submit to the usual genuflexions required, I had proceeded to within eight or ten feet of the Pope, when I raised my eyes; the benevolent dignity of that face showed me that I had erred, and I dropped at once on my knees and found myself near Tucker, who received the blessing of the Pope as his Spiritual Father.</p> 
                
               <p>"I bring from the interview admiration for the person and principles of the Head of the Catholic Church, which I did not think I could ever entertain. His knowledge of events in our country connected with the late election, shows how deeply he feels for those of his own faith, and his remarks upon religious liberty shows how deeply he is imbued with the spirit of human rights. And that is the 'Pope,' the great bug-bear of religion and politics, seeking the spiritual comfort of his coreligionists, and approving of that form of government which leaves men free to choose for themselves, by not annexing to that choice any disqualifying conditions. '<emph>In such a government,'</emph> said he, '<emph>we ought to ask nothing for ourselves beyond what is free to all, and we ought to hope that the spirit which suggested such liberality in constitutional provisions, will abide to protect those who confide in the promises.</emph>'</p> 
               <p>"Surely, Rome will teach me that a man may be a monarchist or a republican, and be a Catholic with either-why not? ln Scotland my own people were Presbyterians<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6012-00000045"/> terians and monarchists, in the United States they are Protestants and republicans.</p> 
               <p>"The interview of to-day will live in my mind with the dearest remembrances of my life.</p> 
               <p>"Tucker is delighted, but I think his sensations are very different from mine; he was congratulated as a child of the Church, and, at the same time, cautioned as to the responsibility which such a privilege incurred. He had his anticipations more than realized. I was saluted with courtesy, and conversed with as a gentleman with gentlemen; and my whole former impressions of the character, feelings, and views of a Pope are not only disturbed, but they are nearly effaced. I am confused, yet greatly pleased. Still, the looks and conversation of <emph>one man,</emph> even though a Pope, must not be allowed too much power over my mind.</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Friday-Thank God for all things-but especially for the kindness of others. Our letter procured to us invitations to the house of Princess B--. She is of the highest rank, of great wealth, and commanding influence. I will not recount my former impressions of that lady and those of similar rank here, because they were mere prejudices; but no idea of their accomplishments could have been extravagant; the ease and grace of the manner of such ladies are beyond all conception. But these are not inconsistent with a total absence of religious principles, and I am happy to say that a morning call here, by no means a necessary sequence of an invitation to a party, seemed to open my mind to the character of the upper class in Rome, and to show that the fashionable lady is, by no means, necessarily an infidel. I saw, indeed, less of religion, in separate parts, in the house, and heard less of it in her conversation, than I had noticed in some other parts of the world, but religion and its requirements seemed to have entered into all her plans and procedures. She lived a life suited to her rank and wealth, and her expenditures were large even in her decorations, but these expenditures went with a direct plan to encourage<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6012-00000046"/> age and reward honest industry; and there was an atmosphere of piety in the palace of the lady, that seemed to sanctify every movement that she made; and whatever was her plan of rest or pleasure for the day, it included a recognition of religious observances, and these were noticeable in every movement; and the Princess B-- going to a party of pleasure, or on a ride for her health, seemed to think that religion was no more out of her way of her observance, than it seemed to the poor girl whom I saw enter San Carlos Church on the Corso, as she returned from the market, set down her well-filled basket, offer a prayer or two, and then slip out at the other door and proceed to the discharge of the more secular duties of the day-to discharge them with a sense of ease and comfort, which nothing but religious observance could confer. That must be a religion worth looking into, which thus manifests itself in the princess and the servant. Let me wait."</p> 
               <p>The two Virginians had one evening spent some time in contemplating the scene to which we have referred, when, Tucker turning towards Millson, said, "Six weeks in Rome at this season of the year is rather an unusual visit for Americans to pay, and since I do not now see you so much engaged in the fine arts, as you have been, and as I think you visit the B-- palace less for the pictures and statues, than for the manners of the living, let me ask you (what I should have thought three months ago, I should have known without asking, known from observation), let me ask, what is the conclusion at which you have arrived, from the contemplation of the effects of a religion on a people? You seem to have adopted a new course, you do not investigate doctrines and compare them with Scripture, so much as you inquire into their effect upon men and manners. And what is the result of that inquiry? May I ask without offence? I mean only, is it time for a question of that kind?"</p> 
               <p>Millson hesitated a moment, as if he wished that the question had not been put, but he answered,</p> 
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6012-00000047"/> 
               <p>"I have few concealments from you, none that concern me alone, and, if I have not spoken before, it is because I have been yet unsettled. It seems as if my early prejudices, or impressions were combatting against my judgment, and a judgment so new as to be distrusted. But I have not been unmindful of the doctrines of the Catholic Church; nay, I came almost prepared to admit those doctrines, provided my judgment was not affected by what I should see of the operation of those dogmas upon the mind and condition of the people, I have conversed with Dr. K--, and even taken the liberty of renewing my visit to the Cardinal F--, with a view of having doctrinal points explained, but as neither of these had ever encountered, in their own condition, the difficulties of Protestantism, I confess that I have derived more information and received deeper conviction from close, intimate, friendly conversation with Dr. --, an enlightened and distinguished recent convert to your Church, than I have from the kind and condescending scending observations of Dr. K-- and Cardinal F--. Let me then say, that I find in my own mind, and in the arguments which, others have used at home, nothing sufficient to lead me to discard the claims of the Roman Catholic Church to be the true Apostolic Church of Christ. But--"</p> 
               <p>"But-what <emph>but</emph> can be interposed after such an admission?" asked Tucker.</p> 
               <p>"But I was sent to Rome-I came to Rome-not to. urge those arguments in favor of, or against, her doctrines, which schoolmen on both sides of the question have adduced-I desired time, and place, and freedom to judge of those doctrines by their unfettered influence on their professors. I came to Rome to see whether I could be a Catholic, and if I had gone away, even after two weeks' residence and observation, I should have allowed my early impression to remain, and to influence my opinions and direct my creed-six weeks have wrought a change. I have seen that the objects adduced as the evidences of the destructive character of<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6012-00000048"/> Catholicity, are proofs of its preservative qualities. That the sunlight of Christian faith has rescued from utter destruction those monuments of pagan greatness which, in pagan darkness, would have mouldered into dust; and Christian precept and Catholic teaching, and Papal residence, have preserved beauty, loveliness, enjoyment, and dignity to Italy, which, without them, would have been the Sahara of Europe.</p> 
               <p>"I have seen the enlarged liberty of elevated life touched with the restraining graces of religion, and the burthen of poverty made light upon the shoulders of the humble, by the lofty hopes and consoling offices of the Catholic religion. I have seen the head of the Christian Church, the wearer of the triple crown, present, in himself, the humility of the humblest Christian, while he asserted the rights of his Apostolic office; and I have seen the princes of that Church labor for the good of the poor, as if their office derived its dignity from the blessings of the afflicted. I have seen the priests, that are represented to us as the lazy parasites of society, bending, day and night, over the couch of the suffering, and sharing their own pittance with those whom they would prepare for heaven. In a city represented as the 'mother of abomination,' and the refuge of ignorance, I have seen the young debauchee lack means of gratifying his depraved appetite, and have met, at almost every street corner, schools for the gratuitious instruction of the young, instruction that reaches from the alphabet to the highest branches of practical science-learning, too, sanctified by the teachings of Christianity. This is not all-not half. In the Pantheon, where all the gods of filthy Paganism were worshipped, I have seen the faithful bow to the memory of the Christian martys. Within the walls dedicated to the Apotheosis of Faustina, I have prayed to the Mother of Christ, and where Jupiter had his adoration, I have knelt to the Maker and Saviour of mankind. Not a monument, not a temple, not a tomb, that owes its erection to pagan superstition or<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6012-00000049"/> pagan pride, but is indebted for its preservation to Catholic interests. And the dark chambers of idol worship are lighted by the sun of righteousness, and purified by the incense that is burned in honor of the Triune God.</p> 
               <p>"I see this, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact, and I bless God that I am willing to admit the evidence of my senses against the impressions of early education.</p> 
               <p>"I repeat it to you, my friend, I came to Rome, not to study doctrines, but to mark the effect of those doctrines. I have fulfilled my mission, and as I have overstaid the time which you mentioned as the ultimatum of your residence here, I now say, that I am ready to go whenever you shall intimate your wishes to depart."</p> 
               <p>"But," said Tucker, "you would not, with these strong convictions on your mind, leave Rome without professing that faith which you have received."</p> 
               <p>"I shall make no profession here; and I ask of you as a right, as well as a favor, that, out of the city of Rome, you shall tell no one of the profession, or rather confession, which I have made to you. Do you promise me that?"</p> 
               <p>"Since you urge it, I do promise it-but, I have no hesitancy in saying, that while you were speaking these glorious sentiments, I was thinking of their effect at Beverly Hall, when read in my next letter to the colonel."</p> 
               <p>"Tucker, that is the last place in the world in which it should be mentioned, but you have promised."</p> 
               <p>"And you know I shall keep my promise, but it is much against my feelings.</p> 
               <p>"You will, however, not refuse the Sacraments of the Church."</p> 
               <p>"I shall make no profession here."</p> 
               <p>"Then, my dear friend, you, who came to Rome a Protestant, may depart a Heretic."</p> 
               <p>"A Heretic!"</p> 
               <p>"Aye, a Heretic is one who, knowing the right, will not follow it."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps in that particular you are right, but I will confer with Father K--; if he admits the correctness of my<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6012-00000050"/> determination in this respect, will you then withhold your censure?"</p> 
               <p>"I think," said Tucker, "that Dr. K-- will scarcely agree to the propriety of such a postponement, but there may be reasons which you can assign to him which do not occur to me; whatever may be the result of Dr. K--'s decisions, I will submit to them."</p> 
               <p>The two friends descended the beautiful stairway of the mount, crossed the Piazza d'Espagne, paused a moment to mark the gushing of the waters at the delightful fountain, and then retired to rest.</p> 
               <p>The interview between Dr. K-- and Mr. Millson was long and deeply interesting to both.</p> 
               <p>"Deeply grateful as I feel to you, and one or two others who have explained to me many points of the Catholic religion, I am free to confess, as indeed I have before partly told you, that confirmation of doctrines was not what I sought. I had a strong belief in the divinity, the divine origin and apostolical character of the Church; I had no doubt that, while historians torians on my side of the channel, had greatly misrepresented the condition of those that represented the Church, there had been much to deplore, much to censure in the actions of those ecclesiastics. The errors, in conduct, of the Jewish priest-hood did not impair the divine character of the Jewish Church, though it brought heavy judgment down upon the churchmen and people. But what I wanted to know was, whether the errors admitted, were the necessary consequences of the Church doctrine and discipline? and, in a few words, whether here, in Rome, Catholicity did not present a phase that would be the strongest argument against the admission of its doctrines? Logically, you will perceive, I admitted the doctrines of the Church to be sustained by the Scripture, and, as consequence, of Scriptural commands; but, if these doctrines were working evil, wherever allowed full operation, I was bound to distrust the whole argument, and admit that, however specious it might appear to one submitting to rules of logic, it failed to sustain itself<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6012-00000051"/> in practice, and thus failed to commend itself to my belief. For one week I realized the predictions of my friends, and felt the truth of the assertion, that 'No one becomes a Catholic in Rome.'"</p> 
               <p>"And now," said Dr. K--, "now that you have spent more than six weeks, now that you have begun to see the operation of the doctrines and discipline of the Church, where there is no extraordinary disturbing power, now that you have, partially at least, examined from the Vatican to the hovel, from St. Peter's to St. John's-what is the conclusion at which you have arrived?"</p> 
               <p>"I can say in the language of the man in the Scripture, 'I do believe, help thou mine unbelief.' I have no doubt upon the Catholic question which does not involve Christianity itself; I admit, 'I believe all that the Holy Catholic Church teaches.'"</p> 
               <p>"Blessed be God, blessed be God," said the good doctor, and those who have ever heard him express any delight, will recollect at once the <emph>unction</emph> with which he uttered these words. "Blessed be God, it is of His grace. Let us make a small offering."</p> 
               <p>And the two kneeled upon the pavement of the room, while the priest offered thanks.</p> 
               <p>"And now, my son, I say to you, also in the language of Scripture, 'arise and be baptized.'"</p> 
               <p>The two resumed their chairs.</p> 
               <p>"Let me explain," said Millson, and he narrated as much of the history of Colonel Beverly's family as was necessary to an understanding of what he had further to say. "To that daughter," said he, "all rash and presumptuous as it was, I ventured to aspire-my family is good, my fortune considerable, and my honor, in all that concerns a gentleman, I believe, unimpeached. She is the only daughter and heiress of one who prided himself more on his family, than on himself and his immense wealth. The hospitalities of Virginia do not allow of certain conventionalities which regulate families in the old world, and therefore, the kindness with which I was received,<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6012-00000052"/> was evidently that due to my position, my neighborly relations, and the conformity in taste between myself and the young lady, as well as the long-established intimacy of our family. I will not annoy you with further particulars, but proceed to say that I was not long in perceiving that my most intimate friend had not escaped the attractions of his relative, and that I had to contend against his strong attractions, his polished manners, his generous disposition, his connexion with the family, and his corresponding religious sentiments. He is a Roman Catholic, and sometime since renewed his relations with the Church. A few circumstances have, at times, led me to think that my attentions (not proposals) were received with pleasure; friends have, in confidence, hinted to me as much, but the strong attachment of Miss Beverly to her Church, it was argued, would give to a Catholic aspirant to her hand great advantages. She never argues on religion, sometimes explains in answer to a question, but illustrates the beauty of Christianity tianity by all the graces, and dignity, and virtue that religion makes evident in woman alone.</p> 
               <p>"No explanation has been had between my rival and me. You, of course, will have understood that I have alluded to Mr. Tucker, now with me at Rome. I have at times thought that he could not but perceive the great advantage which his religion gave him, and yet, with all the kindness of persuasion, he has sought to make me a believer in, and professor of, Catholicity."</p> 
               <p>"God bless him," said the priest, "and he has at length succeeded by God's grace."</p> 
               <p>"I do believe-but now for the reason for not <emph>now,</emph> and here, professing. I believe that Tucker's affections are as much engaged to Miss Beverly as are mine, and that he knew that my adoption of Catholicity would place me on more advantageous terms with his cousin, yet he has assisted in all efforts to remove from me my doubts; he has yielded to all my wishes in this city, and has seconded every<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6012-00000053"/> effort which he deemed likely to give me a correct and favorable view of the operation of the Catholic religion here. Has he not manifested, even to you, a desire that I should become a member of the Church?"</p> 
               <p>"He has been constant in his applications to me to provide means for giving you a correct view of all the operations of Catholicity. He has urged me with incessant anxiety, on your account, and seemed as if far more concerned for you than for himself, or rather concerned for you on account of himself. I have never known more zealous efforts than Mr. Tucker has made for you, and while he was laboring and inciting me to prudent action, he has been careful not to startle you by obtrusiveness, and to leave you to the operation of causes that were around you;-never have I seen a more zealous friend."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you, doctor, for that explanation, it will enable me to make myself more easily understood. With a full knowledge of the danger to his affections and his hopes, he has sought to make me a Roman Catholic; in faith I am one-my profession, <emph>now</emph>, might jeopard all his worldly views-I shall, therefore, and I hope with your approval, postpone my entrance into the Church until I shall have seen my friend made happy for life-or at least until I shall have learned what is to be the decision, uninfluenced by the accident of my conversion. So much in honor, Dr. K--, and I come to ask your permission-your approval of the postponement."</p> 
               <p>"Are you sure of life between Rome and Virginia? Do you hold in your hand any assurance that death will not ask his right? Think of the danger of delay; now that you know and approve the doctrines of the Church, it is disobedience, and therefore mortal sin, to neglect a compliance with her laws. Why should you, upon such a punctilio, deny yourself the benefits and the strengthening consolations of her Sacraments?"</p> 
               <p>The argument was long and earnest, but at length the priest yielded.</p> 
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6012-00000054"/> 
               <p>"I cannot approve, and therefore I can have nothing to say upon your proposition, as a priest of God-but since you desire it, I will say that I <emph>permit</emph> it-but you, and all, will understand that I have neither right nor power beyond what you give, to <emph>permit</emph> an act by you, which concerns yourself alone. I warn you of the responsibilities you assume, and the dangers you incur; but, since it must be so, you may say that I oppose no authority to your wishes. I have no authority as yet to oppose. I should have none, indeed, beyond advice and caution, and the withholding of Sacraments; it is your own work. Oh! why will not men understand that religion is a personal matter; it is not the priest that saves, it is the man, imitating and obeying Christ?"</p> 
               <p>"Well," said Tucker, "what said the doctor? He does not permit any such proceedings, I venture to say. It would be unclerical."</p> 
               <p>"Dr. K-- pronounced the scheme wrong-refused <emph>approval,</emph> but, on hearing me assign certain private reasons, he renewed his protest, but granted permission. So we are both correct."</p> 
               <p>The friends visited anew most of the places of interest in Rome, and agreed to take the diligence on Monday morning for Civita Vecchia. On Sunday, Dr. K-- served at the altar, and among those that kneeled at the foot of the sanctified elevation and received the body of the Lord, was Henry Tucker, strengthening himself for his proposed voyage.</p> 
               <p>As the friends were on their way to the seaport, Millson took occasion to call Tucker's attention to his promise of secresy in regard to the change of views-the adoption of the creed of the Catholic Church. "You will not, by any accident, fail in that I trust?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not, but I think it proper to make one exception, and that is with regard to one individual."</p> 
               <p>"Let there be no individual excepted."</p> 
               <p>"I mean with regard to one individual, and under circumstances which, though quite possible, are, we both hope, not<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6012-00000055"/> probable for some time; I allude to a circumstance which might involve my own honor, or to the imminent danger of the death of one of us."</p> 
               <p>"I do not see that such exceptions are likely to interfere with my wishes of secrecy."</p> 
               <p>At Civita Vecchia the friends felt, as most people feel on reaching that seaport, that their great business is to get out of it.</p> 
               <p>Another extract from the diary of Mr. Millson:</p> 
               <p>"I have sought to know more of myself than I have hitherto inquired for, and I am startled with that which, if a real discovery, should be appalling. Can it be possible that in resisting the evidences of divine truth, as manifested in the doctrines of the Catholic Church, I have been using the weapons of <emph>Atheism!!</emph> I should have felt insulted had any one called me an Atheist, and yet, close examination into my own heart, showed me not only that I have been living 'without God' in all my actions, but that I have been living without God in my heart, my affections, my motives. Indifference, disbelief, utter absence of practical acknowledgment of God, have kept me from inquiry; and human respect has influenced me when the truth has been discoverable; when the light of divine truth has flashed along the line of duty, I have seen the shadows of worldly loss, social deprivation and diverse inconvenience, and I have shrunk from them.</p> 
               <p>"In conversation with several gentlemen here, from the United States, I have found them ridiculing Christianity, really, when they seem disposed only to laugh at Catholicity, and my own heart confesses that it has not been willing to examine the grounds of the Catholic faith, and the authority for practices by which it expresses itself.</p> 
               <p>"Surely, it is time for me to look more closely into a matter on which rests my eternal salvation.</p> 
               <p>"Walking yesterday with H--, of Massachusetts, we approached a group of poor creatures whose appearance was not more indicative of poverty than of immorality<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6012-00000056"/> ality. H-- said, 'this is some of the fruits of papistry, poverty, perhaps, and vice.' And I assented-was it the fruit of papistry? was it the result of the Catholic religion? I had scarcely left H-- when such questions occurred to my mind, and with them the fact that in Boston, New York, Baltimore, London and Liverpool the amount of squalid misery that is scarcely ashamed of vice, that knows no shame, indeed, but detection, is incomparably greater; and I did not, nor did H-- think to impute such excesses of moral and physical degradation to the influence of the predominant religion; and I have, then, manifestly been guilty of injustice here.</p> 
               <p>"Vice and misery are the fruits of irreligion, they exist as the consequence of depravity in man; Christianity has done much to redeem our race, but it has not restored Paradise. Take the age and political condition of Rome, and compare it with the youth and favorable circumstances of the United States, and then look at the amount of vice in each, and surely the land I love and honor would lose in comparison with the land in which I am.</p> 
               <p>"But, if I have been cherishing atheistic sentiments in my heart, and if to them are referable some of the objections which I have urged, and heard urged, against the Catholic Church, how much does it behoove me, here and now, to dispossess myself of such influences. Certainly I have reason to believe that it is not for any form of Christianity that I have been against Catholicity, and a careful examination of my own motives and wishes, lead me to fear that I have desired to disprove the arguments of Catholics, that much upon which the great truths of revealed religion rests may be removed. I dare not say that others are under the same delusion; but this, I say, that I find they are using the same arguments, and indulging the same proclivity of mind, which I find in myself.</p> 
               <p>"Let me here, from my own convictions, and my own self-examination, record my solemn impressions that, though infidelity<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6012-00000057"/> lies at the bottom of the argument against Catholicity, yet I do not think that those who urge those arguments are sensible of the character of the sentiments which they choose, or of the full tendency of the arguments which they use. But my business, my duty, are with, and to, myself; and, detecting the evil in my heart, let me seek to drive it hence."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <p>THAT which has served to produce an important effect on my mind, cannot fail of being at least of deep interest to you; and in a few words I will make you acquainted with a movement, which has assisted greatly towards the object of my inquiries here. There seemed to me a loss or concealment of a link in the great chain of Catholic history. The Fathers, indeed, wrote in the early ages of the Church, but they had the great matters of doctrine and discipline to promulgate and apply, and the minor subjects of rights and ceremonies, of vessels and instruments, were left without the full exposition which close argument seemed to require; and, considering the connection of some of the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, with the ceremonies by which they are illustrated, and<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6012-00000058"/> the partial dependence of the Sacraments upon the mode and means of administration, it cannot be denied that proofs of the antiquity of doctrines and practices may be greatly strengthened by the discovery and exhibition of the places of worship, and the instruments and vessels used in the early ages of the Church; just as we obtain a new insight into the domestic and social customs and ceremonies of the Italians of the first Christian century, by the developments recently made in the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and are able to believe that the women of Pompeii painted their cheeks and appended jewelry to their ears, because we discover the rouge ready for application, and find the ornaments that suit the lobe of a lady's ear. These do not, indeed, prove that ear-rings are the most appropriate ornament, or that artificial color is the best for a lady's cheek, but they certainly show that both were in general requisition at a lady's toilet.</p> 
               <p>"The Catacombs near, and under the city of Rome, have ever been regarded with, deep interest, and the curiosity of modern visitors to the Eternal City has lead thousands of them, of late, to visit these subterranean wonders. These Catacombs, it is known, became the place of worship and of burial for the Christians at, and near Rome, in the first and second centuries of the Church; and, though many things have been discovered and brought from the crypts and corners of the several Catacombs in times past, it is only of late that attention has been drawn to the Catacombs as supplying evidences of the conformity of the religious ceremonies there, seventeen centuries ago, with those that are practiced in the Church of Rome at the present day. Curiosity would have led me to an exploration of these cells, but I confess that I was not unwilling to compare what I might discover below the ground, with what I saw daily, in the churches above, and see how much the ceremonies and services of the present owe to the means and instruments of the past.</p> 
               <p>"It was arranged that Tucker and I<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6012-00000059"/> should, about three o'clock in the morning, call at the Roman College for the Rev. Father Marchi, and another ecclesiastic, and proceed in a carriage to Sta. Agnes, a few miles beyond the city walls. That time was selected because, at this season of the year, it is deemed injurious to the health to make a transition from the heat of the day above ground, to the cool, moist atmosphere below the surface. At the time appointed we all set forth, and passing the church of Sta. Agnes, we entered the plantation near the building and proceeded to a small eminence, where a door denoted the entrance into the Catacombs. Here we were supplied with wax tapers. The door was unlocked, and, having lighted our tapers, we entered the place, and proceeded by a narrow passage downward. After some time we reached the point where, at the side of the passage or narrow street, there were cells in the solid walls, in which the dead had been placed, and numerous bones of the early Christians are yet lying in these repositories. Here and there a little chapel was discovered ered, with sanctuary and altar, with arrangements for separate positions for the sexes, and the accommodation of two priests, an arrangement demanded by the order of the church, to suit the circumstances of the times and the proprieties of such retiracy.</p> 
               <p>"Here, the walls and ceilings retain the paintings with which the visitors of the first and second centuries had ornamented them, and though the art of painting is not greatly illustrated by the samples on the travertin walls, yet the faith of the artists and visitors is easily discoverable by the representations of the Virgin Mother and the Divine Son; while many of the mysteries of Christianity are more than hinted at in symbolical figures that, at particular places, meet the eye. It is not my intention to describe the interior of the Catacombs, but volumes have been written, and others yet may be prepared, to illustrate the instructive lessons of the sanctified place. Many things which seem ridiculous in the belief of the people, here are shown to be rational, if not true,<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6012-00000060"/> by what is left for the eye. Here, altars are found, and from this very Catacomb have been taken and preserved vessels and instruments, exactly such as are now used by the Roman Catholic Church in the administration of her Sacraments, and which seem to have no meaning or use, unless the belief with regard to these Sacraments be correct. Having seen many of them in that hall of the Vatican which is dedicated to their preservation, and indeed, remarked nearly the same at the church of the Catacombs in Naples, I felt deeply anxious to continue my researches, not to find the instruments and vessels, that was not probable, but to see how appropriate the place, the excavations, and the remaining portions of the little chapels where to the uses of the articles.</p> 
               <p>"I repeat, that even if an altar does not always denote a sacrifice, though 'the cup,' and 'patina' may not denote the uses of the sanctified elements; yet having left the place and given some time to the consideration of the subject, to a recollection of all I had seen, and even to much that I had felt, I turned to one of my companions, who was a lawyer of eminence, and a member of a Presbyterian congregation, and calling his attention, or rather referring to what we had been examining with such interest, I said,</p> 
               <p>"'You are, as a lawyer, given to sift testimony, and test its capability of proving; will you, as a practical lawyer, say what you make of the testimony which you have examined to-day; what does it prove?'</p> 
               <p>"'I could, I think,' said he, 'easily evade your meaning were I disposed to, but I understand the import of the question, and I am ready and willing to answer it. What we saw this morning presents irrefragable proof, to my mind, that <emph>the persons who worshipped in the Catacombs of Sta. Agnes, held the same creed and practiced the same rites, as do those who worship in St. Peter's.'</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"It was the opinion of a sound, practical lawyer, who knew how to weigh testimony. It was not until a day or two afterwards that, recurring to the subject<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6012-00000061"/> of our subterranean wonder of the Catacombs, I half sportively said to him,</p> 
               <p>"'If you think that the ancient worshippers in the Catacombs, and the modern worshippers in St. Peter's, were of the same creed and same rites, you virtually admit that both they of St. Peter's and they of the Catacombs, are of the true Church.'</p> 
               <p>"'I have no objection to your conclusion-it is just,' said he.</p> 
               <p>"'Then, why do you not unite with those of St. Peter's, and thus be of communion with those of the Catacombs?'</p> 
               <p>"'Simply, because I do not think it of any consequence of what Church a man is a member, provided he acts correctly.'</p> 
               <p>"It was neither time nor place for argument. The admission which my friend made as to the similarity of creed and rites of the Christians of modern Rome, with that of the worshippers of the first century, seemed to be forced upon every candid man, who, like him, could compare the evidence of the past with the objects and actions of the present. And I felt that I had been allowed almost as conclusive a proof of the identity of the Catholic Church of A.D., 1853, with that of A.D., 152, as had been allowed to Thomas of the identity of the body of the <emph>Risen,</emph> with that of the <emph>Crucified</emph> Saviour. And bowing my head to the testimony and the conclusion, I confessed my inferiority to those who, not having seen, and felt, and handled, as I had been allowed to do, yet owned and followed the Church which in recorded history, in the instruction of tradition, in the light of the present, and in the gloom of the past, in the sun-lit hills beyond the Campagna, and in dark caverns beneath and around the Eternal City, has living testimony of her Apostolic descent, and presents, unbroken, link after link, the golden chain which connects the office and teaching of Pius IX. with that of the Fisherman Peter, and unites them all, all with CHRIST."</p> 
               <p>It is a beautiful sight on a summer or autumn evening to stand on the very verge of the Pincine Hill, and look down upon the city of Rome, to catch its dying hum,<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6012-00000062"/> and to see light after light go out and almost feel the silence that is coming over that great mistress of the world. Far away, towards the right, the lofty dome and strong angles of St. Peter's rest against the horizon, and seem to be spangled with the stars that twinkle around its darkened shape. Above, on the mountain beyond the city wall, a small light casts its beams from a window in St. Agnes, and at little intervals a bell from some distant religious house, tells of an hour gone "with years beyond the flood." Above, the heavenly hosts are going forward in their stately march, looking down upon the city that for twenty-five centuries they have shone upon, and from which, at times, they have been half-compelled to withhold their beams, because of the mockery of worship which went up to these ministers of God, from beings who did not distinguish between the instruments and the master.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Beverly had reached an age when he felt his dependence upon his daughter for the enjoyment of home, and felt it the more, that growing disinclination to the enlarged social interviews of his earlier life threw him, almost entirely, upon his home for enjoyment. It was then he recognized how great a blessing had been to him his lamented wife, not merely what she was in her life by her thousand virtues, but what she had perpetuated to him, by cultivating those virtues in her only daughter. Indifferent in early life to religion, he had not found in his own experience those comforts and consolations which the early professor enjoys. But, since he had acknowledged his responsibilities to God and the Church, he had slowly, but steadily, fallen into the habits that result from the periodical requisitions of that Church; and had found, to his surprise, that while month after month, he was called to make confession of his imperfections as a Christian, yet even those imperfections did not shut him from a higher degree of pleasure resulting from careful attempts to avoid transgressions, and systematic efforts to understand their frequency and extent.</p> 
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6012-00000063"/> 
               <p>Though Colonel Beverly knew that there was nothing in the Catholic religion to forbid the social intercourse which he had so greatly enjoyed in his younger days, yet he felt there was much, in what he might regard as an abuse of that intercourse, to induce him to avoid at least frequent repetition thereof, as leading to the "sins which most easily beset him." So, without the least misanthropy, with full love to his fellow-man, the Colonel relinquished, without a sigh, many indulgences that had afforded pleasure; and while he entertained frequent or occasional visitors, with the hospitality that smacked of the festivity of other years, he chastened the entertainment with the restraints which Christianity imposes. And, while Mary was in household offices occupied, the colonel was often seen sitting in the portico of his mansion, overlooking the broad expanse before him and indifferently drawing his elongated pipe, yet deeply immersed in meditation of things that took hold on eternity.</p> 
               <p>"Mary," said he, one day to his daughter ter as she took her seat beside him, "I have a letter from Henry."</p> 
               <p>"Is he about to return?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes. He speaks of the health of himself and Millson, and of the satisfaction which they have had in their visit to Rome, but I do not notice that he makes any further reference to the unfavorable impressions, which objects there had made upon Millson."</p> 
               <p>"I do not think, father, that Henry would be likely to repeat a remark which would tend to diminish your entire respect for William, nor would William allow any manifestations of an impression which would wound the feelings of Henry. One is a practical Roman Catholic, and the other is, at least, a true Virginia gentleman. And I am sure you have noticed the delicacy with which each of them treats any subject upon which they are not of the same opinion."</p> 
               <p>"Then, Mary, you assign to Cousin Henry the double qualification of a good Christian and a true gentleman."</p> 
               <p>"No one doubts it, I hope."</p> 
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6012-00000064"/> 
               <p>"No; not that I know of. But the union of those two qualifications in Cousin Henry must, of course, give him a great advantage over William Millson."</p> 
               <p>"With whom, dear father, with whom will it give him any advantage?"</p> 
               <p>"Well-I do not know with whom, in particular-but society generally," said the colonel.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not, father, perhaps not. Though, in this part of the State, there is little of the spirit of intolerance, with regard to the Roman Catholic creed, thanks to the morals of dear mother, and your virtues."</p> 
               <p>"My virtues!" said the colonel, lifting his hand in deprecation. "Thanks to the angelic virtues of your dear mother, virtues exercised and transmitted," said he, kissing his daughter, and finishing the sentence, "thanks to such virtues, our social intercourse is uninterrupted."</p> 
               <p>"Well, though that be the case, still Catholicity is not that which would give one accomplished gentleman possessing it any advantage with the public over his equal in other respects, not possessing it. As you know that, dear father, let me ask you what you mean?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, Mary, if <emph>I</emph> could see in both these young men a strong attachment to you, feelings far beyond those that belong to their relations to, or connexion with our family, it could not have escaped your discernment-nay, Henry undoubtedly gave you distinctly to understand the state of his feelings, and the hopes which he entertained. And, perhaps, William was equally free with his propositions; he, undoubtedly, if not as hopeful and as free in his professions, is as ardent in his affections. If you know these things, then you will, I think, admit that Henry in his double qualification has an advantage with <emph>you?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"Father, I have no desire to marry; I am, I think, as happy here with you, as I could be with a husband. But, if I should ever marry, I should prefer that my husband should agree with me in religious views and practices; and I freely say to you, that of the few Catholic gentlemen<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6012-00000065"/> who visit here, or whom we have met in Baltimore, Washington, or at the watering places, I have seen none that I should prefer to Cousin Henry."</p> 
               <p>"I wish Cousin Henry could hear you."</p> 
               <p>"I incline to the opinion that Cousin Henry has understood me for some time, quite as well as you now do."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my daughter, it has been my fate, through life, rather to admire, than to understand women. But neither you, nor Cousin Henry, ever told me that there was such a good understanding between yon."</p> 
               <p>"You will find, whenever Cousin Henry speaks to you about these matters, that there has been no deception on my part."</p> 
               <p>"Has not Cousin Henry seriously addressed you?"</p> 
               <p>"He has."</p> 
               <p>"And your answer to him was--?"</p> 
               <p>"You know, dear father, that both Henry and William have aspired to be your son-in-law?"</p> 
               <p>"But you have said that you would not marry a Protestant?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Never, never, did I say or think so. Such a decision must be a reproach, not only on my mother, but on you, my dear father. But, you will admit, dear sir, that mixed marriages are dangerous in many respects?"</p> 
               <p>"I willingly admit that."</p> 
               <p>The dialogue was interrupted by a call from one of the servants for instruction in household affairs, from "Miss Mary."</p> 
               <p>"We shall have all this settled pretty soon," thought the colonel, as he renewed the tobacco in his pipe. "The boys will be back in a day or two, perhaps before, as these steamers seem to annihilate distance; and then, I hope, something will occur that will serve to settle the mind of Mary, who seems troubled, and, as I think, about this very subject."</p> 
               <p>That evening letters reached the colonel, stating the arrival of the <hi rend="i"/>Pacific, and the intention of Tucker and Millson to be at Beverly Hall about as soon as the letter which announced their arrival in the country.</p> 
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6012-00000066"/> 
               <p>The next day Tucker arrived at the hall, and announced that as soon as Millson had paid his respects to his aunts, acting as mothers, he would follow him to Beverly Hall.</p> 
               <p>We need not say that Colonel Beverly and his daughter were glad to see Tucker and Millson, and that they welcomed them with a warmth of expression which was due to the relations that had so long subsisted between all parties.</p> 
               <p>The colonel had resolved, though generally leaving such matters to others, as he remarked, "when he was young he contrived to manage his own courting," he resolved, now that he understood that both the young men were lovers of Mary, to see which way the current of his daughter's affections was setting. Of the worth and excellence of both Henry and William he had no doubt, but he felt that the former had much advantage in his creed. Earnest as he was in the exercise of his religious privilege, and zealous for the cause of the Church, and yielding, as most Virginians are, to the claims of consanguinity, Colonel Beverly had more than once been struck with traits of character and instances of conduct in Millson, which seemed to entitle him to extraordinary respect; and of the letters of Tucker from Europe, with the exceptions of one referring with regret, not censure, to the effect of Catholic worship on Millson's early impressions, many, nay, almost all of them, tended to augment in the colonel's mind the feelings so favorable to Millson.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Cousin Henry," said the colonel to himself, "Cousin Henry could not have known that Millson is also in love with Mary-no; how should he have known it, when <emph>I</emph> did not?"</p> 
               <p>A few mornings afterwards the absence of Henry from the breakfast table, lead to the information that he had suffered much during the night from fever; and Millson, on his return to the parlor, announced the necessity of having medical advice at once. In anticipation of which, Millson installed himself in the chamber of his friend as prime nurse.</p> 
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6012-00000067"/> 
               <p>The bilious fever of the climate had taken a strong hold on Tucker, danger was apprehended, and in a day or two the apprehensions were confirmed by the physician.</p> 
               <p>"The prescriptions must be closely followed, and the attention unremitted," said the physician, "and excuse me, if I add, if you think it best to call in a clergyman of your own denomination, I advise that it be done at once; not only because his mind is now clear, but because, in an advanced stage of the disease, interference of any kind is often fatal to the patient."</p> 
               <p>Mary had anticipated, by one day at least, the order; and that evening the clergyman arrived.</p> 
               <p>It is not our intention to follow the progress of the disease, suffice it to say that the priest "prayed over him, annointing him with oil in the name of the Lord," and, contrary to the expectation of Henry's nearest relatives, who had arrived, and the overwhelming fears of William and the Beverly family, "the prayers of faith saved the sick man and the Lord raised him up."</p> 
               <p>Slowly, indeed, did the disease relinquish its influence, days passed, in which answers to inquiries were only, that "he is certainly better."</p> 
               <p>Meantime, William and Mary relieved each other at the bed of the sufferer, that his wishes might be gratified by the presence of one or the other. The sick man's friends who continued at the hall, assisted, as they were permitted; but Mary or William was in constant requisition.</p> 
               <p>Nearly two months had passed, and Henry had gathered strength to take a short drive with William, and once, at mid-day, had walked a few rods with Mary. Hopes were now strengthening into certainty of his recovery, and it was deemed necessary to urge only caution upon him, and William and Mary were appointed guardians of the convalescent, and made securities for his prudence.</p> 
               <p>It was a lovely evening, late in September, a soft moonlight lay upon the fields around, and while it tinged with lustre the<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6012-00000068"/> leaves of the trees, it cast a deep shade beneath their branches. The heat of the day had scarcely been mitigated by the departure of the sun, and Henry had been placed <emph>near,</emph> not <emph>at,</emph> a window, to mark the loveliness of the scene abroad. The quiet was only disturbed by a few of the servants near their distant quarter, who had assembled upon the grass, and were singing "the evening hymn to the Virgin."</p> 
               <p>As the voices of the colored choristers died away, Henry motioned for his cousin to sit nearer to him.</p> 
               <p>"Mary," said he, "do you think that I am past danger now?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, if you are prudent, if you avoid exposure to the night air, and all improper food."</p> 
               <p>"I feel, dear Mary, how much of this I owe to the watchfulness and devotion of you and Millson; next to the blessings of God, through the Sacraments of the Church, I certainly am indebted to my two nurses."</p> 
               <p>"Your thanks to God, Henry, will, I dare say, be considered as including all acknowledgements to instruments. I am sure neither Mr. Millson, nor myself, would desire more."</p> 
               <p>"Since you confirm my hopes, Miss Beverly of early recovery, I will use this occasion to call back your attention to a proposition which I had the honor to make to you a few days before I left for Europe-to accept my hand, my name, and my fortune; my heart, you know, you have long since wholly possessed."</p> 
               <p>"You are not in a situation, Cousin Henry, to confer on such a topic, you are weak and nervous, and even a little agitation might, and probably would, revive the fever, and that might indeed prove fatal. Let us postpone this subject."</p> 
               <p>"My situation, Mary, is just one that needs the consolation of a certainty, which the conversation will probably produce, and nothing could give strength to my nerves, and recuperative action to my system, more than the assurance that my proposition were accepted, from a reciprocation of my affection."</p> 
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6012-00000069"/> 
               <p>"I must insist upon it, Henry, that you discontinue this conversation, I foresee an injurious effect upon your health."</p> 
               <p>Henry paused-a cloud passed over his face. Mary gazed at him for a moment with inexpressible fear, as she saw a tumult of feelings subside into a painful sadness.</p> 
               <p>"Cousin Mary," said Henry, "for once and only for once in my life, do I venture to differ from you. This is the time, and my state of health is most suited for the explanation which I seek.</p> 
               <p>"Cousin Mary, you did not respond to my profession of affection before I left for Europe, and your silence then seemed to me most appropriate. Now I ask, respectfully, anxiously, for such an answer as is due to my unfailing affection, and to that candor which, not I alone, but which all admire in you. I know you too well to suppose that you would consent to wed any man whom you did not respect for his moral character, whom you did not love more than any other person. Therefore, I renew to you my proposition, and place your acceptance on the grounds of affection for me. I will not suppose that there is anything in my moral character that could prove a hindrance to the union-even high as I know your standard of excellence to be, because I also know that you have consideration and charity for the weakness of our nature, which brings us so far short of the true standard of man."</p> 
               <p>"Cousin Henry, you do justice to my appreciation of your moral qualities, though you do less than justice to the many virtues for which you are cherished at Beverly Hall, and, most of all, for the exemplary conduct which illustrates your Christian character-I mean the consistency of your life with your profession."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you, Cousin Mary, but your reply lacks one point to make it full and satisfactory. The respect which you avow for me, is, I know, fully extended to, and more richly deserved by others who visit the hall."</p> 
               <p>"Not, surely, that which springs from religious affinity," said Mary.</p> 
               <p>"No, perhaps not; but still you speak<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6012-00000070"/> only of respect. To deserve and receive that from you, is much, but you will recollect that my proposition included more; it asked a return of love for love, of that peculiar affection which, though augmented by the respect which you profess, is yet an independent sentiment. In short, Mary, may I hope that your reflections upon the declaration which I made to you and which, as if by mutual consent, remains till now unanswered, have lead you to accept the offers which I made, and thus insure my happiness."</p> 
               <p>"Cousin Henry, would your happiness be insured by the union which might not spring from an entire preference of yourself, on the part of your wife-a preference which would, perhaps, be for another, if circumstances, ordinarily unconsidered, were changed."</p> 
               <p>"No, I would offer myself to no woman whom I did not greatly prefer to all others, nor to any one, until I had some reason to think that she had manifested some preference for me."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <p>"HAVE I ever deceived you, Cousin Henry?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Mary, never; but I may have deceived myself. Let us not refer to such a subject, I can do you no injustice on that point. I have spoken thus far, most freely to you, because I had your father's consent, and, as I think, his approval; and, as I had reason to believe, that he had informed you of my intention."</p> 
               <p>"There are few events which my father and I keep secret from each other, unless they are the secrets of third persons. But--"</p> 
               <p>"Nay, Mary, let me proceed now, I cannot mistake the character of your answer. I thank you, for what I regard a candid statement, you may still respect me for what of virtue I may practice, still regard<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6012-00000071"/> me with the affection which our relationship and long intercourse warrant, but you do not accept me as a lover, as one to be your husband."</p> 
               <p>"Henry, ought I to be censured for these things?"</p> 
               <p>"Not by me, Mary; not by me. But let me speak to you now, plainly. From what I have said you may infer that I am much disappointed at the result, thus far, of this conversation; I am pained, mortified, and my pride a little wounded, but I am not disappointed. I had prayed, I had expected, nay, I had prepared myself for all this. Before I left for my European tour, I felt a strong apprehension that the attachment which existed between us, was one that you regarded as arising out of, and terminating with, our family connection, and the feelings of friendship to which that connection gave rise; and, I thought I saw that, had William Millson possessed the same advantage of relationship and religious conviction that I enjoyed, he would, if he had sought the distinction, have been the favored lover; and, when I learned that he had sought that, I felt that he deserved, and would obtain, the hand that we both sought."</p> 
               <p>"Did I deceive you, Cousin Henry?"</p> 
               <p>"Hear me, and then you will know my opinion of you and others. Let me say to you, that I built some hope on the difference of creed, held by William and me, and when he proposed to visit Rome, I will not deny that I thought-I do not say <emph>hoped</emph>-I <emph>thought,</emph> that the usual effect of a short visit to that city, would be produced in his mind, viz: disgust for ceremonies which he did not comprehend, and institutions which needed study, at least, for approval: and the first week of our visit fulfilled these expectations. But a change soon came over him, his comprehensive mind grasped, more readily than usual, the whole plan of Church polity, and he yielded to the influences of a religious atmosphere that pervades the Holy City, and from sneering at ceremonies, he became a steady, not enthusiastic, admirer of that which distinguishes Rome from all other cities in the world. In little more<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6012-00000072"/> than a month, I was ready to cede to him obedience to ordinances, and earnest, fruitful inquiries into doctrines. HE WAS A ROMAN CATHOLIC."</p> 
               <p>"William Millson, a Roman Catholic?" asked Mary, with a subdued, but earnest voice.</p> 
               <p>"Aye a Catholic-and, by becoming one, removing the only ground of hope which I had entertained of securing your hand."</p> 
               <p>"And did you think that I would accept a man, simply because he submitted to the Sacraments of the Church? <emph>You,</emph> at least, know better, and you might have suspected motives for the conversion that would have removed your fears, so far as regarded him."</p> 
               <p>"But you are still safe, Mary, he may claim your hand upon higher ground. He has not been admitted a member of the Church, though avowing belief in its divinity and doctrines."</p> 
               <p>"And does he make evident to you, Cousin Henry, the sincerity of his conversion, when he withholds the profession of his faith, and denies himself the efficacy of the Sacraments? Is it a fear of the world that withholds the profession, or is it a door of escape, in case his professed conversion should fail to secure his object here?"</p> 
               <p>"The only sentiment of real unkindness, of entire injustice, that I ever heard my dear cousin utter."</p> 
               <p>"I speak, Henry, not from a knowledge of what has taken place in Rome, but what you have said. Has William Millson avowed a belief in the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, and refused to receive the Sacraments, and to submit to the discipline of that Church? You know that worldly respect, or hesitating faith, can alone explain, that <emph>in general,</emph> and in the <emph>present case</emph> the other alternative, that of commending himself to me by professing and avoiding responsibility, when he has obtained what he appears to think the price of his concession, is the only resort we have. I tell you, my dear cousin, and I tell you with the candor and the freedom that belong to our<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6012-00000073"/> relations, which you now feel can never be closer, I tell you, that though you were right in your views of my feelings towards Mr. Millson, so correct that I do not think that difference of religion would have been an obstacle (on my side) to a union-yet, with such a development of character as you have made in his regard, a development I confess truly astonishing to me, I could never think of him even as a friend. I know how high a compliment is supposed to be paid to a lady, when a gentleman offers her his hand, but I cannot regard that as a compliment either to my principles or my mind, which involves such a prostitution of moral principles in him that makes the offer. I thank you for this explanation, it is painful, but it was necessary."</p> 
               <p>We do not know what any other young man would have said and done, under the circumstances in which Henry Tucker was placed. We are, however, presenting a person under the influence of the doctrines of the Catholic Church, and we shall have to do only with <emph>him</emph> and <emph>his</emph> proceedings.</p> 
               <p>"You do not believe, Cousin Mary, that the feelings which I avowed to you relative to the chance of disgust in the mind of Millson, at Rome, with regard to religious persons and ceremonies, influence me in any way to the injury of his prospects at home?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Henry, no. I have known you from my childhood, and I believe you incapable of a dishonorable motive, of any act, or thought, unbecoming a Christian gentleman."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you, Cousin Mary, I thank you; that places <emph>me</emph> right. Let me now proceed with what I have, further, to say.</p> 
               <p>"When I saw that it was only the first impression of things at Rome, that was producing the bad effect on Millson, I resolved to wait, without argument, the influences of time; and, when I saw a favorable turn, I introduced him to a clergyman of distinction, who is prudent as well as zealous, and who confined himself<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6012-00000074"/> self to responding to the questions, or reviewing the objections, propounded by Millson. This proved to be the correct way, and, some days before our departure, I found Millson in a satisfied state of mind. But, the Rev. Dr. K-- while he rejoiced at the result, seemed pained at something which I could not comprehend. At length, I understood that Millson refused baptism, though arrangements could have been made for that Sacrament to be administered in the most private manner, at St. Agatha, or with more ceremony by a Cardinal, in the Chapel of the Propaganda. Still he declined, earnestly, positively--"</p> 
               <p>"And thereby," said Mary, "forfeited his claims to Catholicity."</p> 
               <p>"However God may judge of the act, or His priest pronounce upon it, I, at least, Mary, must proclaim it one of the most convincing proofs of true Christian sacrifice, that I have ever known."</p> 
               <p>"Christian sacrifice, to decline the Sacrament!"</p> 
               <p>"Aye, eminently so. It has come to my knowledge, as indeed I partly suspected, that while William saw the advantage which my religious profession gave me in this house, and while he had arrived at a belief in those doctrines, the profession of which, I thought, gave me that advantage, he resolved to take no advantage of his new position, to deny himself, indeed, all advantage of his creed, by postponing its profession, till that profession should not be pleaded as a means of success; or, to do him still more, but not enough, justice, till my claims to your hand should not be jeoparded by his conversion. And, Cousin Mary, that is the man who will ask you to become his wife. Upon such lofty motives does William Millson mould his conduct; I sink into insignificance as I compare myself to him. I feel the presumption of contending against him for a heart like yours. He is worthy, eminently worthy, of you; and, dearly as I love, highly as I prize you, let me say that only you can be worthy of him.</p> 
               <p>"Do not speak to me now, dear Mary, leave me, you are distressed, and I am exhausted<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6012-00000075"/> hausted; we will even, on this occasion, omit our social prayers. Let me, however, be remembered in yours."</p> 
               <p>Mary rose, with agonized feelings for her cousin, and throwing her arms around his neck, kissed him with a warmth that told of the new admiration for his character which his revelation had inspired.</p> 
               <p>The next morning Tucker asked Millson, as soon as he reached the hall, to accompany him in a short walk, on the lawn. While the friends were sitting in the shade of an oak, beyond view of the house, Tucker said:</p> 
               <p>"You recollect, William, the promise you exacted of me as we were leaving Rome-of secrecy, as it regarded your change of views on the subject of religion?"</p> 
               <p>"I do, and never did I feel more anxious for the preservation of that secret. It is of consequence to me, to my character, to my honor."</p> 
               <p>"And yet I have revealed it."</p> 
               <p>"Impossible! you do not forget your promise?"</p> 
                
               <p>"No, nor the <emph>exception.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"True, there was an exception."</p> 
               <p>"And the case has occurred which I anticipated when I made it. Hear me: during my recent sickness I was not indifferent to what passed around, and impressions with regard to Mary's preferences became strengthened, by words and movements, that to other eyes and ears, might have conveyed no proofs. If I had died, if even lingering sickness had preceded that death, nothing of my apprehensions would have been revealed. But recovering, I felt it a duty to you, to Mary, to myself-to myself especially-to remove all doubts. And, last evening, I proposed formally again to my Cousin Mary, or rather, I called to her consideration a proposition which I had made on the eve of our departure for Rome. As I had suspected, she loved me as a cousin, respected me as a friend, and delighted in my society as a Christian, but the very intimacy of our relations was cited as proof that nothing more could be hoped for; I am, William, no longer your rival<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6012-00000076"/> as indeed, excepting in affection for Mary, and friendship to you, I have ever been unworthy of being."</p> 
               <p>"Henry, you have, upon some punctilio of honor, sacrificed your hopes, and perhaps Mary's happiness. You have done wrong, and I must retrieve for you the false step you have taken. You know her feelings towards you, you know her attachment to that religion which her life adorns. You know the partialities of her venerable father for his kindred, and you know your own preminence over all others: and if you do not, you are the only one who is ignorant of your advantage. It must not be; and now, so soon after the error you have committed, it will not be difficult for me to remedy the evil. I shall lose no time in doing it."</p> 
               <p>"It is too late for your attempts, Henry, and they would be wrong as well as fruitless; Mary loves another, I am assured, at least I am sure of that."</p> 
               <p>"Another! whom, whom does she love, Henry?"</p> 
               <p>"You, William; you, she has long loved, as only woman can love, and now that she knows all your sacrifices to friendship and honor she loves you yet more. Do not, by any false notions of delicacy, throw away the reward that Heaven offers to your virtues; and do not doubt that my affection will be-<emph>ought</emph> to be-gratified with the happiness of its object, and my honor satisfied with the success of my friend."</p> 
               <p>"Henry, you have erred; you have overrated what you call my sacrifices, you have done yourself injustice; I cannot consent to accept happiness at such a cost to others. I will hasten at once to Mary."</p> 
               <p>"Do, William, do go, but nothing that you can say in favor of me will diminish her preference for you. But I beseech of you, do not wound her womanly pride, by seeming to undervalue that preference. And you will also be cautious in your procedure, recollecting that I had no authority to make known to you the feelings of my cousin."</p> 
               <p>That last hint was necessary, and it had its effect.</p> 
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6012-00000077"/> 
               <p>"I will be prudent, but I must be just," said Millson.</p> 
               <p>Millson found Mary in her favorite retreat, and, having accepted an invitation to be seated, said,</p> 
               <p>"Miss Beverly, before I left for Europe, I made you acquainted with the state of my affections, and with the presumptive hopes which they had inspired. Unworthy as I am of such favors as I sought, and now seek, I am emboldened to renew my offer of hand and heart, and without seeking for a direct answer, I solict at least the favor of that intercourse which will enable you to judge something of my character, and my ability to minister to your happiness."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Millson," said Mary, "your visits will always be agreeable at Beverly Hall, my father regards you as a friend, and certainly enjoys your society."</p> 
               <p>"Your father is eminently kind, Miss Beverly, and no one more appreciates his partiality than I do. But may I hope that his daughter shares in his partiality?"</p> 
                
               <p>"I hope, sir, nothing in my deportment has ever lead you to think yourself an unwelcome visitor here. As to partiality, that might be an improper manifestation."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Beverly, I have sought, by honorable means, to win your particular regards; I have felt how little I deserved them, excepting by my endeavors, but those endeavors have, I hope, made me more worthy of them."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Millson, have you not to-day seen my Cousin Henry?"</p> 
               <p>"I have."</p> 
               <p>"Has he not told you of some conversation that passed between him and me, last evening?"</p> 
               <p>"He has."</p> 
               <p>"Then you know that I am apprised of much that you intended to conceal from me."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Beverly, terrible as is the risk which I incur, I cannot, in honor, forbear to state that your Cousin Henry has greatly overrated all my apparent sacrifices, and infinitely underrated the<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6012-00000078"/> honorable course which he pursues towards me."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Millson, you can adopt no theme more grateful to my ear than commendations of Henry Tucker."</p> 
               <p>"And I can pursue none, with more justice. But let me not appear to trespass upon any rights of my friend, and your cousin. He knows that I visit you, he advised it, and he has too much honor to seek for a triumph in my failure. May I aspire, not to your hand alone, but to your affection; at least, let me presume to ask whether there is any inseparable bar to my hopes?"</p> 
               <p>"I know of none."</p> 
               <p>"My creed--"</p> 
               <p>"Is good, but your practice, or neglect, is not sanctioned any more by me, than by Dr. K--."</p> 
               <p>Things were taking a pleasant course, when it was thought that Colonel Beverly should be informed of these movements in his family. But Henry had told his uncle all.</p> 
               <p>"This is," said the old gentleman, "rather a dying out of my branch of the family-and I fear a shutting up of the old mansion."</p> 
               <p>The name might in future be provided for.</p> 
               <p>Beverly Hall was to be occupied by its present owners.</p> 
               <p>The marriage preparations were ample, and, as William thought, rather protracted. A few days before the wedding, Henry Tucker came to see his uncle, cousin, and friend.</p> 
               <p>"I have received a letter," said he, "from Dr. K--, in Rome, and I shall accept an invitation which he kindly extends to me, to visit once more the 'Eternal City,' and to take chambers in the college."</p> 
               <p>"But," said the colonel, "you will be with us on the 10th?"</p> 
               <p>"I regret that it will be impossible. The steamer starts on the 15th, and as I must arrange my affairs for an absence of some months at least, perhaps years, I must take my leave of you this morning."</p> 
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6012-00000079"/> 
               <p>It was not long before Henry rose, and, kneeling before the colonel, received his blessing. He then turned towards William. Millson took the proffered hand, but said.</p> 
               <p>"Not here, Henry. I shall accompany you through the wood; and leading him to Mary, William turned round, while the cousins took leave of each other with an affectionate embrace, from which Mary was released in an agony of feeling.</p> 
               <p>When the friends had reached the grove at the foot of the lawn, they paused.</p> 
               <p>"Farewell," said Millson, "I do not, I cannot mistake your motive, in accepting the invitation of Dr. K--, and I stand convicted of selfishness in accepting happiness at such a sacrifice to my friend-I am truly distressed."</p> 
               <p>"William," said Tucker, "no event, not even the possession of Mary, with the acknowledgement that I was not her first choice, could make me so happy, so content, resigned, at least, as I now feel, knowing as I do that you are worthy of her, you whom she loves are to watch over her happiness. Pardon me if I say watch gently over my cousin. But of your religion, where is now the profession?"</p> 
               <p>"It awaits the arrival of the priest, and one Mass will make me a child of the Church and the husband of Mary."</p> 
               <p>"Be ever worthy of both."</p> 
               <p>A few arrangements in regard to correspondence were made, and the friends embraced and parted.</p> 
               <p>Millson, on returning to the hall, learned that Mary had retired to her room. He respected her emotion, and with the delicacy of true affection avoided intrusion upon her.</p> 
               <p>The marriage of William and Mary had been fixed for the 10th of May.</p> 
               <p>"And," said the colonel, as he consented to the arrangement, "you will be finding some excursion, which will leave the old man alone for a time."</p> 
               <p>Mary knew that some excursion was contemplated by William, and she felt pained at the deprivation which it would cause to her father.</p> 
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6012-00000080"/> 
               <p>"There is to be a grand celebration," said he, "by our neighbors on the other side of the Potomac, on the 15th, and, without informing them of our motives, we might, either from Washington or Baltimore, make one of the party, and share in the festivity."</p> 
               <p>"That would be agreeable to you, dear father," said Mary, "as you could easily accompany us."</p> 
               <p>"And I should like too," said the colonel, "to visit once more the home of your mother, and renew my acquaintance with scenes sanctified by their association with her name and residence."</p> 
               <p>"It will be a hard tax upon the hospitalities of the people of St. Mary's," said Millson, "to have our party added without special invitation to the company already expected."</p> 
               <p>"There must be more than we can take with us to be burthensome to the hospitality of St. Mary's," said the colonel. "I shall go without invitation, without notice even, and try the bed and table of some of the old residents. There is a mansion on the border of the river, exactly opposite the residence of the priest, with which I shall make free, and I know the owner will regard our advent as a compliment to, rather than a tax upon, his liberal hospitality. My old friend Coad will, I am sure, find a pleasure in maintaining the fame of St. Mary's for hospitality, and he can do that without much effort, as it will be only the indulgence of his own and his wife's disposition."</p> 
               <p>"By the way," said Millson, "Coad is a name of long standing in St. Mary's, but not of the best historical odor. But your friend seems to redeem the fame of his ancestors."</p> 
               <p>"My friend is not a descendant of the person who distinguished himself by his tyranny and cruelty, in the early history of Maryland. My friend is a descendant from the Puritan Pilgrims, and his ancestors came, at a late day, to the Colony of Maryland from that of Plymouth."</p> 
               <p>"But Mr. Coad is a Catholic?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, a result of a fortunate marriage of a descendant of the Pilgrims of<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6012-00000081"/> Plymouth with a descendant of the Pilgrims of St. Mary's; and he combines the business habits of his paternal ancestors, with the piety and hospitality of those of the Catholic side."</p> 
               <p>"These Puritans seem to graft well on the Catholic stock," said Millson.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes," said the colonel, "and let us see whether the descendants of the Cavaliers will not do as well."</p> 
               <p>The morning of the 10th of May, 1855, was clear and lovely.</p> 
               <p>"Blessed be the bride on whom the sun shines," said the colonel. "I never have heard the saying repeated without recollecting that I heard it with pleasure on the morning of my own marriage; and the bride of that morning was blessed through all her life, because her happiness consisted in the amount of happiness which she diffused among others."</p> 
               <p>The broad gush of day was in the east, when the priest approached the altar, around which were kneeling the whole of Colonel Beverly's family, and some of his neighbors of the Catholic faith. William Millson arose as the priest approached him, and submitting to certain ceremonies, and answering certain questions, he received what is denominated "Conditional Baptism."</p> 
               <p>The priest then commenced the solemn forms prescribed by the Church, and continued the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass. The charge, at the close, contained nothing beyond that prescribed in the ritual, excepting a reference to the Month of Mary, the month specially devoted to the Blessed Virgin.</p> 
               <p>One hour after the close of the ceremony, before assembling at the breakfast table, William entered the chapel. Mary was there-</p> 
               <p>"And you have come, William, as I have, I am sure, to return thanks to God, and--"</p> 
               <p>"And," said William, to commend to the blessed protection of the Immaculate Mother, our dear friend Henry."</p> 
               <p>Mary reached her hand to her husband, and they proceeded in silence.</p> 
               <p>It was a beautiful morning, full of promise<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6012-00000082"/> mise, for the celebration of the day. Steamer after steamer swept up the St. Mary's, and the joyous celebrants exhibited more enthusiasm as the beautiful scenery of that river was developed. One steamboat stopped opposite the landing of the clergyman of St. Inigoe, and a small boat was soon lowered and manned, three persons, a lady and two gentlemen, were seen to leave the steamer. As the boat neared the shore, the Priest of St. Inigoe's left his house and walked towards the landing.</p> 
               <p>When the party reached the shore, the senior gentleman walked forward to meet the clergyman.</p> 
               <p>"Colonel Beverly, I think," said the Father.</p> 
               <p>"The same, sir, come to ask from you, in behalf of these, a repetition of that blessing which, nearly forty years ago, your predecessor bestowed upon me and my wife, now a saint in heaven."</p> 
               <p>Mary stepped forward.</p> 
               <p>"This is my daughter, Rev. Father, and her husband."</p> 
                
               <p>All kneeled, and the gentle blessings of the man of God fell upon the prostrate party, like the dew of Hermon which descended upon Mount Zion.</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Bendicat vos dominus ex Sion,</foreign>" said the priest, as he bent affectionately over them, "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">qui fecit clum et terram.</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>Mary walked beside the priest towards the house.</p> 
               <p>"And will you, my daughter, be as successful a missionary with your husband, as your blessed mother was with hers?" asked the priest.</p> 
               <p>"Never, Father, for my husband was received into the Catholic Church some days since."</p> 
               <p>"Blessed be God," said the priest, "you have even excelled your good mother in your missionary labors."</p> 
               <p>"Nay, Father, neither my mother nor myself deserves credit for the conversion, by arguments, of our husbands; for myself, I can say that I never held an argument with Mr. Millson upon the doctrines of the Catholic Church, and I have heard my mother say that she never discussed<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6012-00000083"/> religious questions with any one, especially with her husband."</p> 
               <p>"And yet both are converts?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, by the grace of God, but certainly not by women's argument."</p> 
               <p>"No, no; perhaps not, my child. Precept is nothing to example, and argument often awakens pride, rather than produces conviction. One of the best modes of bringing any man to the adoption of a Christian's life, is the evidence of the necessity of grace, and the best missionary efforts I have ever known in civilized communities, and especially in a mixed family, the greatest attraction to Catholicity, are the beautiful correspondence of conduct with profession, and the illustration of duty in the sweetness of its discharge. The triumph of our Church is not, that strong arguments have converted your father and your husband, but that the sweetness of those born and educated Catholics, have commended the principles upon which that sweetness rests, to the approval and adoption of others. God, who abundantly blessed your dear mother, has more abundantly blessed you. Let your conduct correspond with his grace; <emph>but, above all things, be humble.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"I wish to-day, Father, to occupy, if possible, with my dear father and husband, the pew in which my mother sat when she worshipped in your church: to sit where she sat, and kneel where she knelt."</p> 
               <p>"You shall be gratified in all that," said the priest, "and may you be able to walk as your estimable mother walked. Her lovely illustration of the influences of Christianity both in the chastened gaiety of her maiden life, and in the beautiful examples in which her conduct as wife and mother abounded, made her the cynosure of her sex."</p> 
               <p>That day Colonel Beverly assisted in the worship at St. Inigoe's for the first time since his marriage there, and when the solemn services of the altar were concluded, the happy family were among the crowd that, near the old site of St. Mary's, celebrated the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers. They did not join the festivity of the evening, because Mary wished the<pb n="166" xml:id="VAC6012-00000084"/> next morning to commemorate her mother's love for the Church in which she was baptized, confirmed and married: and as the morning sun poured its horizontal beams through the windows of that ancient temple, they rested on the heads of Colonel Beverly, of Mary, and of Millson, who were kneeling before the altar, to commemorate the love of a holy woman, and receive the body of a crucified God.</p>
