                  <p>In this novel the author has with great ingenuity blended fact with fiction, and few will rise from its perusal without believing that our own revolutionary hero, Michael Rudolph, is really identical with Marshal Ney. The story is full of incident, ranging over a most stirring period of the world's history, and the characters introduced form a striking tableau. Rudolph's domestic trials are finely wrought out, and the character of Alina is powerfully drawn. Lovers of romance, and readers of history will be equally interested in the development of this delightful story.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head> 
            <p>THERE is a legend which at one time was widely believed in this country, that Michael Rudolph, a hero of our own revolution, and Michael Ney, Marshal of France, are the same person.</p> 
            <p>At the close of the Revolutionary war, Rudolph returned to his home to find a faithless wife, and dishonored name. He resigned his position in the American army, embarked for Havre, and was known to have engaged in trade in that city for a few months.</p> 
            <p>He then disappeared, and a young soldier gifted with the same remarkable military abilities, enlisted in the French army about the same time. Under Napoleon, the glory of this young adventurer finally culminated in that of Marshal of France, Duke of Elchingen, Prince of Moskera.</p> 
            <p>Imagination has supplied the missing links, and I have not thought it necessary to present my hero under any other names than the one he inherited from good people, and that he won for himself.</p>

               <p>IT was yet early spring, in the heart of that valley in which my story opens, yet it was the spring of a genial clime, and favorable season. Gay birds poured forth their sweetest notes of welcome to the young year, the fields of the husbandman already gave promise of a flourishing crop, and all looked peaceful to the eye as the Garden of Eden before sin and sorrow entered there.</p> 
               <p>Surrounded by cultivated fields, and sheltered from the summer sun by a grove of majestic elms, stood and humble homestead, constructed of logs rudely cemented together with clay. It was a building of considerable extent, and the presence of industry and taste was testified by the neatness of the little lawn, and the care with which the yellow woodbine was trained over a rustic portico in front. Ivy covered the rough walls of the cottage, and wild vines transplanted from the woodland overarched the narrow casements<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6349-00000005"/> ments, their foliage of vivid green offering a pleasing contrast to the spotless drapery which curtained them within.</p> 
               <p>Sheep grazed in the meadow, and the distant tinkle of the bell worn by the leader of the flock was heard at intervals, and the declining sun brightened every object in the sylvan scene. All was peace without, but the restless, struggling, never-satisfied heart of man was at variance with the very stillness and repose that reigned in this happy valley.</p> 
               <p>Within the verge of the forest was a wide pathway completely sheltered from observation from the house, and on this a figure paced to and fro with folded arms, apparently absorbed in reflections of an unpleasing nature. Though scarcely on the verge of manhood, his person was tall and finely proportioned, promising in its full development a combination of strength and physical beauty rarely united, but it was from the face that the power of the mind shone forth. Boy as he was, a strength of purpose lay in the clear, calm, gray eyes, in the curve of the beardless lips, which spoke eloquently of the future character of the man. A high, fair forehead was slightly shaded by masses of dark brown hair, and the expression of the whole face was that of calm, undaunted courage, and indomitable resolution.</p> 
               <p>That young heart had already begun to feel the boundaries of his native valley too narrow a field for his adventurous spirit. In imagination he had soared far beyond its leafy shades, and in his sanguine pictures of the future, the laurel wreath, and the victor's triumph were ever the reward of deeds of daring achieved by himself. Discontent was stirring in his breast; to be a tiller of the soil was in his estimation to rise very little superior to the clods among which he labored, and he recoiled with inexpressible disgust from the destiny which fortune had apparently decreed to him.</p> 
               <p>The younger son of a farmer in moderate circumstances, the emancipation of the youth from daily toil seemed hopeless. Many years had elapsed since Mr. Rudolph had emigrated from Germany and settled in Maryland; in contented obscurity the family had hitherto dwelt, for they were happy in the new home they had found. Schools were few in those days, and the means of bestowing a liberal education on his children was not within the reach of the good old farmer, but they were carefully trained in the way they should go, and their mother, a woman of strong capacity and considerable information, imparted to them all she knew.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph possessed a tenacious memory, which was stored with the old ballads of her fatherland, in which were celebrated the exploits of its bravest sons, and these chivalrous pictures of deeds of high enterprise made a lasting impression on the mind of her younger son. Those old legends moved his spirit as a strain of martial music, and the flushing cheek and sparkling eye with which he listened to them, might have revealed to the observer the new world which was opened to his enthusiastic and ardent fancy.</p> 
               <p>As the youth pursued his walk, at intervals gesticulating and muttering broken words which revealed the unrest within, the figure of a girl appeared upon the pathway, who stopped and watched his motions with eager interest. She was scarcely fifteen, but was matured both in mind and person far beyond her years. Her form was slight and graceful, and her dress was better than might have been expected to be worn by one who issued from that unpretending homestead, though much of its effect was, perhaps, to be traced to the taste of the wearer, for she was a coquette by nature, and only needed opportunities to develop into-but let the progress of events show what she finally became.</p> 
               <p>Alina Derval was not critically beautiful, but there was a charm in her smiling mouth, a fascination in her magnetic<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6349-00000006"/> eyes which few failed to acknowledge who were thrown beneath their influence. The last were large and expressive, with shell-like lids heavily fringed; their color was hazel, with a gleam of red glinting through them at moments, which gave them the stealthy expression of the feline tribe, but this was evanescent, and the next look would probably be one of tender and pure truthfulness.</p> 
               <p>Her complexion was clear, and the rose tint of perfect health glowed through a surface as fine as porcelain. Her lips were full, red as a cleft pomegranate, and unclosed on teeth even and white as the finest pearls. Yet it was this lovely mouth which furnished the true clue to her inner life. It was sensuous, wilful, and indicated a capricious and domineering spirit, which in time to come would have its own way even if her world were crushed in ruins at her feet to attain it. But the crowning glory of Alina was her hair; a mass of golden radiance it now seemed, as the evening sun glinted upon its shining surface. It was braided in long plaits which were coiled around her head, partially concealing its defective outline, for those portions to which the phrenologist assigns benevolence and reverence were depressed, while self-esteem and acquisitiveness rose large and prominent above them. The hair was of that shade immortalized by painters-a deep-toned gold with a gleam of purple shining through its silky masses. The incipient coquette knew and valued its rare beauty, and the greatest care was bestowed on its arrangement.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph turned at the end of the walk and saw the girl, who approached him with slow and seemingly timid steps. An expression of radiant pleasure flashed over his face, and he came rapidly toward her. He took both her hands in his own, and looking earnestly in her bewitching face, he said:</p> 
               <p>"You seem excited, Alina; what has happened since I left the cottage an hour ago? You are flushed, and your sweet eyes sparkle with unusual brilliancy."</p> 
               <p>"I came hither to tell you of the arrival of a stranger, who comes hither to-to-"</p> 
               <p>Her voice faltered, and her eyes shrank from the clear light of those bent upon her. Rudolph hurriedly said:</p> 
               <p>"Not-not to bear you away from us, Alina?" and there was a choking gasp in his voice which told its own tale of precocious passion, of deep heart-love, such as few men are capable of feeling. The girl faintly replied:</p> 
               <p>"I fear it must be so. My uncle has sent hither a young officer who is to escort me to his family. I cannot refuse to go, for I know that I am a charge to your mother of which she will be glad to be rid. I am aware that my presence in the Glen has caused her much uneasiness."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense; my mother is the kindest of women, and she was happy to be of use to one thrown upon her kindness as you were. You must have secured for yourself a warm place in her heart by this time."</p> 
               <p>Alina shook her head dubiously:</p> 
               <p>"I hoped to make Mrs. Rudolph love me, but there is something which I cannot understand, that holds me aloof from her. I could never confide in your mother, though I know her to be a good and true woman. She holds me always at arms' length, as my nurse used to say, and I have an internal certainty that she does not like me."</p> 
               <p>"Not like you, <emph>you,</emph> so fair, so lovely, so enchanting, for, after all, that is the only word to apply to such a being as you are, Alina. You must overcome this fancy, for my dear mother must approve and love the girl of my heart."</p> 
               <p>She glanced archly at him from beneath her long eyelashes, and a half smile wreathed her lips.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps you have named the very cause of her coolness. Your mother loves you so fondly that she cannot bear the<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6349-00000007"/> thought of a rival in your heart. Besides, Michael, we are both such children that she thinks we should not be dreaming of love and marriage."</p> 
               <p>"Children! I am no longer a child. I am a man in stature as I am one in thought and aspiration. The world shall soon hear of me as one, for it is my fixed purpose to emerge from this obscure life, and seek name and fame in the arena of the world. I will become one of the great ones of the earth or die in the attempt."</p> 
               <p>His noble face beamed with excitement-his eyes flashed, and his voice sounded as a clarion note ringing over the field of battle. The girl looked at him with that glance of power that bent every one to her will: her cheeks flushed, and her lips were tremulous as she impulsively said:</p> 
               <p>"When you speak thus-when you look thus, I forget all that lies between us-I love you and feel that you will overcome every obstacle in your path till you have gained such a position as will entitle you to claim my hand from my proud relatives."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph snatched her to his breast as he impetuously said:</p> 
               <p>"I swear to do so. I feel the impulse stirring within me that must lead me on to great actions. The future looms before me, and in it I behold myself renowned-wearing the laurel wreath of the victor. Ah! my beloved Alina, when that hour arrives, you, who have not scorned the love of the humble youth fate cast across your path, shall share my glory; you shall walk hand in hand with me upon the path I will open for myself. Ah! it is grand to be the architect of one's own fortunes. I shall win! I feel that I shall!"</p> 
               <p>Alina grasped his hand, and earnestly replied:</p> 
               <p>"I feel it-I know it. The stamp of greatness is placed upon you. You bear it on your noble brow; in your fearless eyes. I trust to your future, and I will share it with you. You will yet realize the prediction made for you in your infancy. Repeat it to me, Michael, for I never weary of hearing of the grandeur that is in store for you."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph smiled:</p> 
               <p>"Do you really attach importance to the revelations of the old madman who drew my horoscope, and predicted a wonderful destiny for me? But the things he promised are, you know, impossible to an American."</p> 
               <p>"I cannot see why. But was the old man really mad? Tell me the facts of the story, please, for I have only been told of the predictions."</p> 
               <p>"His brow flushed:</p> 
               <p>"You will think it nonsense, I know, Alina, though your ambition, like my own, will lead you to hope that there may have been 'method in the old astrologer's madness.' The story is this: When I was scarcely a year old, I lay at the point of death, when a wayworn traveler came to our door and asked for food. It was given to him, and after he had satisfied the cravings of hunger, he glanced at the gasping infant that lay in the cradle at my mother's feet. He made a few inquiries, came near, and examined my condition; then, in an assured tone, he said:</p> 
               <p>"'Madam, your child will not die. He will live to become a great warrior, and his name shall descend to posterity as the bravest of the brave.'</p> 
               <p>"Of course my mother listened eagerly to such words, but she replied:</p> 
               <p>"'Only assure me of his life, and the future may take care of itself.'</p> 
               <p>"'He will live-I tell you he <emph>must</emph> live, for the fate of a great empire will more than once hang upon his fearless bravery.'</p> 
               <p>"Of course my mother believed the stranger to be insane, and as she was alone in her cottage, she thought it<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6349-00000008"/> best to humor his fantasy; but she became extremely nervous when he leaned over the cradle and passed his hands over my face and breast. To her astonishment, the convulsive heavings of the chest, which had threatened a spasmodic attack, soon ceased under his mysterious manipulations, and I fell into a quiet sleep. She was grateful for the relief thus afforded, and as the sun was sinking behind the hills, and the next house several miles away, she invited the stranger to spend the night beneath her roof. He readily consented, and when my father came in from his daily toil, he entered into conversation with him, and found that he was one of those restless beings who cannot confine themselves long to one spot. He had wandered in every civilized land, and gathered information in all which was of little practical use to himself. In the East he had studied astrology, and he passed a portion of the night in marking out a rude chart of the wonderful future that was to be mine. My mother preserved it, though both she and my father have often made themselves merry over the improbable events foretold."</p> 
               <p>"Why improbable?" was the impatient query of Alina.</p> 
               <p>"Because there are no princes in this country, and he said I should become a marshal and a prince, under the greatest conqueror the world has known. That the fame of my leader should eclipse that of Alexander and Hannibal, and I should only be second to him in glory. See how absurd such a prediction is, when made of a poor farmer lad, in a country that is resolute to maintain its freedom even at the point of the sword."</p> 
               <p>"Who knows?" said Alina, musingly. "The time has come for great events, for Captain De Vere, the stranger of whom I spoke, says the country is on the eve of a great revolution, and my uncle sent him for me because it will soon be unsafe for me to travel to Virginia. The end of the commotion may be the establishment of a great empire here, which you will help to build up and sustain."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph listened with breathless interest.</p> 
               <p>"The struggle about to commence! The glorious struggle for independence and self-government! An hour ago all was dark before me, but now I see my way clearly. I will volunteer, and take the first step toward the grand future I am to win. Ha! this is news indeed."</p> 
               <p>In his excitement he forgot his companion, and set forward to the house with bounding steps. A pleading voice called after him, "Michael," and he turned and came back even more rapidly than he had left her. She reproachfully asked:</p> 
               <p>"Is this the way you desert me at the first intimation of approaching strife? When the trumpet of battle rings out, you will lose all thoughts of love, of home--"</p> 
               <p>With passionate solemnity he grasped her hand, and said:</p> 
               <p>"When I lose all thoughts of <emph>you,</emph> Alina, my heart will be cold in death! But I must see this stranger-must learn his tidings from his own lips, for they will change the whole tenor of my life. I go to fight my way to fame, that I may win <emph>your</emph> hand-be worthy of your love."</p> 
               <p>While Rudolph thus spoke, he drew her rapidly forward, and yielding to his impulsive haste, the two soon reached the door of the cottage. Within the large central room, with its bare floor, and rude contrivances for comfort, sat three persons: The elder Rudolph, a man of fifty, though looking much older from the effects of the laborious life he had led; his eldest son, a young man of twenty, in the rough dress of a countryman, but bearing upon his well-knit frame, and finely formed head, the same stamp of nobility which nature had impressed upon the younger son. The strange officer-tall, slender, and aristocratic in his<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6349-00000009"/> bearing, with his highly ornamented uniform and glittering side-arms formed a striking contrast to the noble old peasant and his handsome son, both of Teuton blood, and bearing the stamp of their race in their blue eyes and fair complexions.</p> 
               <p>The stranger was dark, haughty, and stern-looking, with deep set, black eyes, that flashed beneath his overhanging brows with love, anger, or defiance as the spirit within was moved. He was now speaking with much animation, and the father and son were listening with vivid interest.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir; the unnatural contest between the mother country and the colonies has commenced. Blood has already been shed; but the contest must be a short one, for they can never stand against the power of England. I trust the madness of the hour will soon pass away, and the deluded people return to loyalty to their king."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Rudolph shook his head dubiously:</p> 
               <p>"It's a long score they have to settle, Captain; and if they've commenced the fray, be sure they will fight it out to the bitter end."</p> 
               <p>"But, my dear sir, they will be crushed; the country will be ruined; and all because these madmen will not submit to a trifling tax. 'Pon my honor, it is too absurd to make a quarrel <foreign xml:lang="FRA"> l'outrance</foreign> for such a cause as that!"</p> 
               <p>"So <emph>you</emph> may think," replied the sturdy yeoman, "but <emph>we</emph> think differently. If we submit much longer to the yoke, we shall only be fit to be slaves, and to transmit a heritage of shame to our children."</p> 
               <p>The eye of the Englishman flashed on him its haughtiest glare, and he imperiously said:</p> 
               <p>"I trust that you and yours are not infected with this wretched heresy. Can you hope to establish a better government than the one under which you have so long flourished? The country, sir, would become the prey of some ambitious military chieftain, even if you could accomplish the feat of wrenching it from the British crown."</p> 
               <p>"We can but fight for our rights, and leave the issue to the great Jehovah," replied the old man, calmly. "If we are to win our freedom, GOD will raise up the right man, and give him wisdom to legislate, as well as to fight."</p> 
               <p>"So," replied the officer, scoffingly, "you trust to miracles, as did the Israelites of old; but God is ever on the side of justice, and in this warfare the right will be with the mother country."</p> 
               <p>"So you are bound to believe, for you wear her uniform, and are pledged to sustain her cause; but we, who have long suffered wrongs at her hands, hold a different faith. We can but try the issue; and I feel sure that although the struggle may be long, it will end in the freedom of the land."</p> 
               <p>Haughty and stern was the expression of the Briton as he listened to these words, and in a constrained tone he said:</p> 
               <p>"When I came hither I hoped to find loyal hearts around me. I hear such sentiments with regret from a man like yourself, Mr. Rudolph, for you have judgment and experience, and you must see the ruin that is approaching these prosperous colonies. They must be subjugated, for the mother country has power to crush all opposition; and by heaven! she will do it, sir."</p> 
               <p>"And I as firmly believe that we shall win our independence. This wide-spread country, with all its noble advantages, is too great to remain the appanage of a foreign power. Our interests are not those of England, and the time has come to assert our own power of self-government."</p> 
               <p>The face of De Vere became scarlet, and a lurid fire flashed from his dark eyes, as he exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"This is treason, sir, and I am an officer bearing the<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6349-00000010"/> commission of the King of Great Britian. Beware of your words, or it may be worse for you than you imagine."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph arose with an expression of dignity which might have become Cincinnatus when accepting the dictatorship of Rome. He said:</p> 
               <p>"I stand beneath my own roof-tree, built upon the soil I have redeemed from the wilderness with my own hands, and I claim the right of a free man to utter my sentiments with reference to the struggle which you say has actually commenced. I am too infirm to take an active part in the strife, but I have sons who will strike for God and freedom with right hearty good will, and my blessing shall go with them. What say you, Rupert?"</p> 
               <p>The young man thus appealed to eagerly responded:</p> 
               <p>"'Right against might' shall be my motto, father, and when the hour comes I am ready for the strife."</p> 
               <p>"And I too: I dedicate my life to the noble cause of my country," exclaimed Michael, who, with his companion, had drawn near, unperceived by the eager group.</p> 
               <p>De Vere abruptly turned toward the speaker and surveyed him with an expression of stern displeasure. He sarcastically said:</p> 
               <p>"The half-fledged falcon is eager to swoop upon its quarry. Take heed, young sir, lest the contest prove too unequal; yet it will be as well perhaps to teach such youngsters as yourself a useful lesson."</p> 
               <p>A red flush mounted to the brow of young Rudolph as he listened to this taunt. He impetuously said:</p> 
               <p>"And we in our turn will give a lesson to greybeards, by which the world may profit throughout all the ages yet to come. I am but a boy in years, but I bear a man's heart within me, and a patriot's hope for the emancipation of my country from the thraldom in which she has long been held. Every drop of blood in my body thrills to the summons to arms, and I came hither to hear for myself that the glorious strife has actually commenced."</p> 
               <p>The officer haughtily regarded his excited face, then glanced at his well-knit and strong frame, and a momentary doubt as to the issue of the impending conflict crossed his mind. If this youth of fiery impulse and dauntless courage was a fair sample of the yeomen of the country, there was little prospect that victory over them could be achieved without a long and arduous struggle; as to the final result he would not permit himself to doubt. "Might against right" had too long been the motto of his arrogant country to permit one wearing the British uniform to anticipate any other than final submission to her power. De Vere coldly replied:</p> 
               <p>"The strife <emph>has</emph> commenced, but by the time you are thoroughly drilled, and prepared to take part in the war, it will be ended. There is no concerted action between the colonies, and the revolt must soon be crushed out. Let me advise you to temper your warlike ardor, or to take the side of justice and loyalty."</p> 
               <p>The clear eye of young Rudolph met the stern one of the speaker, but it did not quail before it. With that simplicity which is the test of true greatness, he said:</p> 
               <p>"I intend to be both loyal and just, though we probably differ in the application of the words. I must be loyal to the cause of my native land, and just to weigh her causes of complaint against the mother country. I cannot argue with you, for I have little learning, but I can feel for right and justice, and am resolved to cast my destiny with that of those who seek to uphold them."</p> 
               <p>"Tush! that is the universal cant," was the contemptuous reply, "as if the government from which you are seeking to escape is not the best, the most munificent in the world. You will impoverish your country-ruin and desolation<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6349-00000011"/> lation will follow this mad outbreak; and, after all, the authority of the king will reign paramount over the land before a year has passed away."</p> 
               <p>"Then the Anglo-Saxon race will have lost its valor. Onward in the march of life, is their watchword, and having once undertaken a cause, they never give back. The end may be long in attaining, but it will come, and freedom will be won."</p> 
               <p>"Freedom; is it not yours already? But I forget myself; I did not come hither to argue on the right of my master to his own dominions; it is only my business to defend his cause. It gives me great pain to see the seeds of rebellion sown broadcast over the land. In traveling hither I have heard nearly the same sentiments expressed in every house that sheltered me."</p> 
               <p>"And yet you confidently look forward to the restoration of the king's authority," said Mr. Rudolph, with a grim smile. "It is the <emph>people</emph> who are moving in their might, and I feel that God will be with them. I would not be discourteous to a guest, and therefore I beg that this discussion may be ended for the present."</p> 
               <p>The officer bowed, and turning to Michael, said:</p> 
               <p>"This too is your son, I presume, Mr. Rudolph; though he is very unlike his brother."</p> 
               <p>The old man smiled.</p> 
               <p>"He is his mother's image, and his father's hope. Michael is a fiery lad, but a better heart does not beat in a human bosom. He has always had a great hankering after military honors, and I expect to see him a great warrior yet. His horryscope, as the old fellow called it, was drawn in his infancy, and Michael is to be a very great man-even a prince after he has won ever so many battles."</p> 
               <p>"Then he must serve under a king," said De Vere, gravely, "for such titles are not won under republican rulers."</p> 
               <p>"But not under <emph>British</emph> rule," replied Rudolph, significantly, "for with them, princes are only found among the royal family. If I ever attain such distinction, it must be through my own good sword, backed by deeds of noble daring."</p> 
               <p>"Doubtless the leaders of the rebellion dream of building up a great empire here, and of creating titles as high-sounding as those that are so rife in foreign courts," said De Vere, scornfully. "But even if gained, they will lack the prestige of long descent, and their owners the refinement inseparable from high caste."</p> 
               <p>"We have not many books," said Michael, "but among them are a few histories of crowned heads, and I have not found that either intelligence or refinement are monopolized by them. On the contrary, the great ornaments of nearly every distinguished court have risen from the people by innate force of character. Boy as I am, I have had visions of a great conqueror sprung from the people, who swayed a continent by the force of his own powerful genius. Honors flowed freely from his hand, and a galaxy of talent and fame, more brilliant than the world has yet seen, gathered around him. Perhaps this vision is to be realized in this country. Who knows?-let it be where it may, I shall play my part in the grand drama, which is opening even now. The hour for action has arrived, and I will prove myself no laggard in the path of duty."</p> 
               <p>"Tush! you are but a boy, and what is more, a dreamer," replied De Vere, contemptuously, and he turned impatiently away, and gazed through the door. Rupert here asked:</p> 
               <p>"Where has fighting taken place? The name of the place shall be always remembered."</p> 
               <p>"It was at some insignificant little town in the colony of<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6349-00000012"/> Massachusetts. Lexington was the name; but it was a mere skirmish-nothing of any consequence. A few battles, and the whole thing will be put down. It is impossible for these colonies to stand against the power of Great Britain."</p> 
               <p>"And <emph>I</emph> say it is impossible to hold men in slavery who are worthy of freedom," said Michael, with fire. "The battle is not always to the strong, but perseverance may accomplish a victory over power, through sheer weariness of the contest. We may struggle for years, but we shall surely conquer in the end."</p> 
               <p>"Verily, here is a second Daniel come to judgment," said De Vere, with a bitterness he could not control. "On the contrary, I say that the might of a powerful nation is not to be set at naught by a handful of undisciplined countrymen, without military knowledge, arms, or resources. It is sheer madness to provoke such a contest."</p> 
               <p>"The back is fitted to the burden," said Mr. Rudolph, with a grim smile. "But enough of this; my son, do not forget the courtesy that is due to a guest beneath our roof. When the time comes, <emph>act,</emph> but leave alone discussion that can only irritate and imbitter."</p> 
               <p>He placed his hand on the shoulder of Michael, and the youth bowed submissively; but a fiery pang of jealousy darted through his soul as he measured the graceful form of the stranger, and compared his aristocratic bearing with his own rough exterior. The certainty that Alina Derval would be exposed to his fascination, thrown completely upon his protection for many days to come, was gall and wormwood to him. His soul of fire had bowed already before a girl's wiles, and the love she had awakened was in proportion to the depth and intensity of his own nature. He turned away heart sick, and went again into the open air to breathe more freely.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE YOUNG LOVERS.</head> 
               <p>ALINA had lingered beneath the shadow of the portico, and as Rudolph issued from the house she turned her face toward him, wearing its most charming smile. She joined him as he walked away, and carelessly said:</p> 
               <p>"You must not look so glum while I stay, Michael. What have you heard that makes your eyes flash as if you wish to strike at some one."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph paused, set his teeth firmly together, and looked searchingly upon her. Alina playfully raised her hands, and with a light laugh, said:</p> 
               <p>"You look as if you had seen a spirit, and an evil one at that. What is it, Michael?"</p> 
               <p>"I have seen some one who may work me evil; and I almost feel that he will do it in some way. Alina, this man who comes to take you to your uncle is handsome and young. He will certainly make love to you. I know it, for men of his stamp always amuse themselves with whatever falls in their way. But he will not be in earnest, Alina. His professions will be as hollow as his heart is false, and I warn you to beware of him. If you betray me for him, you will lose everything-everything."</p> 
               <p>"Mercy, Michael, when did you set up to be an oracle, I wonder, and why should you speak in this fierce and solemn way to me? Have I not told you that I love you? that I will wait to share with you the splendid future you are to win? What more can I do, pray?"</p> 
               <p>"You can guard your faith; refuse to let your heart be tampered with, as this dark stranger will surely attempt to do. Oh, Alina! keep your plighted troth pure and true,<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6349-00000013"/> and I swear to you to accomplish the astrologer's prediction. I will place a coronet upon your brow, and in the light of the fame I will win by my valorous deeds, we will walk hand in hand in such happiness as was known to Adam and Eve in Paradise."</p> 
               <p>He took her hands, clasped them fervently to his lips and heart, and looked into her eyes with an expression of such heroic trust that she was moved. She dimly felt that this unformed boy, with his grand nature, his undeveloped talents, did not promise more than he might perform. Unpromising as surrounding circumstances were, the arena of great events was opening, and he must rise to the top of the wave that led to fame and fortune. Alina possessed great ambition, intuition beyond her years, and withal, her heart had been touched by the passionate devotion of the youth. After a pause, she replied, with serious emphasis:</p> 
               <p>"My troth is yours, Michael, and it is my purpose to keep it in good faith. We are too young to marry yet, and my uncle will not think of matrimonial prospects for me for at least four years to come. In that time, you can win your way to such a position as will entitle you to his consideration."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my darling; but your uncle will scarcely be willing to bestow your hand on a revolutionist, I am afraid. My hand will be raised in defence of my country, that of your relative against its freedom."</p> 
               <p>A pale shadow crept over her face as she listened, and she slowly said:</p> 
               <p>"Then your bright future is all a dream, Michael. The revolt will be put down, and its leaders punished; if you really love me you will join the side that is bound to be successful. It is your only chance to win my uncle's consent to our union; he will never give my hand to him who raises his arm against the royal cause. You cannot surely mean that it is your purpose to fight <emph>against</emph> the mother country?"</p> 
               <p>"Alina, I must espouse the cause of justice. For my soul's salvation, I dare not take sides against men whose battle-cry is freedom from oppression."</p> 
               <p>"Oppression! Nonsense! Who interferes with them unlawfully? I have often heard my father say that the colonies are better off under the protection of a great country like England, than they would be if they attempted to stand alone among the nations of the earth. You will not risk ruin by joining a cause that <emph>must</emph> fail? Say that you will not, for my sake."</p> 
               <p>She bent her seductive eyes, glittering through tears, upon him, and the soft clasp of her slender fingers thrilled his hand as she laid her own upon it. Rudolph felt all her fascination, all her power to mould others to her will, but something within him struggled against the wiles that would lay him as a shorn Samson at the feet of this Delilah, and he fervently said:</p> 
               <p>"I love you, Alina, with the strength of manhood, united with the passionate impulse of the boy, which in years I still am. Out of this great love shall spring the power to win you even from your haughty and prejudiced uncle; but my path lies with the new men, and the new era that is rising. How can one humbly born, and reared in the lowly sphere of a yeoman's son, hope to rise to distinction among the aristocratic sons of England? No-it is here, and with the new cause that I must identify myself if I would win a name, and fame, among men. I shall gain them, and this dear hand shall be my sure reward-speak, Alina; will not the successful revolutionist be as welcome to you as if his hard-won honors had been the gift of a royal hand?"</p> 
               <p>She looked upon the frank, handsome face; into the deep, expressive eyes, so full of fire in moments of excitement<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6349-00000014"/> ment, so tender now as they sought to read his fate in her own, and her best feelings were aroused. She held out her hand with a half averted face, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Make your name famous, Michael; win a station that is worthy of me, and I will not refuse to share it. But in the meantime our troth must be held as a secret between us. My uncle would be sure to disapprove of this childish dream of love, if it came to his knowledge, therefore we must keep our own counsel."</p> 
               <p>"That we will do, my darling. Deep in my heart will I bury our precious secret, and banquet on the hope in the future that lures me on to deeds of noble daring. Four years! that is a long time in which to act. When you are nineteen, and in the bloom of your radiant beauty, I will lay my laurels at your feet, and claim my reward."</p> 
               <p>"And you shall receive it," was the gracious response, though a moment afterwards she broke into a merry laugh, and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Why, what a couple of mad children we are, to say what we will do four years hence. It is an age, in which a thousand things may take place of which we do not dream now. In that time you will see scores of prettier girls than I am, and give your heart in turn to each one that angles for it. 'Man is inconstant ever,' says the poet, and in that respect I believe that women are not far behind them."</p> 
               <p>There was a tone of light mockery in her voice that jarred painfully on the feelings of her companion. He dropped the hand he had taken in his own, and bitterly retorted:</p> 
               <p>"And you will find amusement in listening to the flatteries of yonder gay gallant, who comes to bear you away as an errant damsel. You but anticipate my inconstancy as an excuse for your own. Is it not so, Alina?"</p> 
               <p>She looked upon his bent brow, and again laughed.</p> 
                
               <p>"One would think you a real tragedy hero, to see you now, Michael. I declare, I believe I shall be half afraid of you, after all, and had better accept the homage of a carpet-knight like this Captain De Vere. He would yield to my fantasies, and would seek to win my smiles by such flatteries as women like to hear, while you would expect me always to yield to you-is it not so, Michael?"</p> 
               <p>There was a tone of mocking banter in her voice that bitterly pained him, while it had the effect of more deeply enthralling him, for this girl, with her light nature, her gay with, and winning ways, had taken such a hold upon his heart, that Rudolph felt as if life would be worthless without her companionship. He did not reply to her immediately; he fixed his large, luminous eyes upon her with an expression that caused hers to drop before them, and then in a soft, ringing voice he said:</p> 
               <p>"Such obedience as is lawful for the wife to render to the husband I would exact of you, and no more, Alina. My tender love shall be your shield; my strong arm your support, and sorrow that I can avert shall never fall on you. To Captain De Vere, you would be the plaything of an hour; adored as long as you fascinated him, and then thrown by as a broken flower that has lost all its sweetness. See-I am a seer in my own way, and I foretell your doom with either of us. Choose your fate."</p> 
               <p>A shiver passed over the girl's frame, and she grew pale: as a lightning flash, a gleam from the future came to her soul, and she felt that her lover's prescience was not entirely at fault. With a forced laugh, she said:</p> 
               <p>"You frighten me with your solemn looks and strange words. It is cruel, and unmanly, to talk to me in this strain, when I have again and again, assured you of my love. Captain De Vere is nothing, can be nothing to me. I merely travel under his protection as far as Baltimore, where<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6349-00000015"/> we shall join the major of his regiment, whose wife will take me under her protection till I reach Norfolk, where my uncle is stationed."</p> 
               <p>The brow of Rudolph cleared, and he gently said:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me Alina, I have been unreasonable, for I was jealous at the thought that this young officer would have you so long under his exclusive care. This alters the aspect of affairs, and I can part from you with an easier heart."</p> 
               <p>"I am glad that you are satisfied. I shall soon be under the protection of Mrs. Stanmore, and I shall be very careful not to accept the attentions of Captain De Vere further than will be absolutely necessary to my comfort on the journey. There-does that satisfy you, you exacting creature?"</p> 
               <p>"It must, for I have no power to arrange it otherwise, but oh! Alina, if I could keep you forever from the acquaintance, the influence of this man, I would gladly do it. I mistrust him; I have taken one of those strange aversions to him which I believe nature often sends as a warning. When I looked upon him I felt as if the evil genius of my life had crossed my path. He and I will yet meet in deadly strife; I am sure of it, and when that hour arrives, one or the other will bear the mark of Cain, but which it will be, God above can alone foresee."</p> 
               <p>He was pale with emotion, and his voice sounded low and ominous. Again that cold, thrilling pain ran through the light heart of the young girl, who listened to his words. She drew near him, laid her hand caressingly upon his arm, and looking into his eyes, she deprecatingly said:</p> 
               <p>"Not from me-oh, not from me, Michael, shall come that cause of strife. I bantered you idly, but my heart is true to you."</p> 
               <p>He grasped her hand so firmly as to cause her to cry out with pain, and in accents she never forgot, said:</p> 
               <p>"See that you keep your pledge before God and man, or he curse of blood will indeed cling to you."</p> 
                
               <p>At that moment a pleasant voice was heard speaking from a door which opened from the side of the cottage towards which they had strolled.</p> 
               <p>"Michael-Alina, come in; supper is served, and we are ready to sit down."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, mother," responded Rudolph, and the two, endeavoring to look as usual, approached the house.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph, a fair, middle-aged woman, with the same air of simple grandeur that characterized her younger son, watched them as they drew near, and drew her own rapid conclusions as to the nature of the interview which had just passed. A clear head and warm heart, with keen perceptive powers, gave her the same species of intuition that belonged by right of inheritance to her son. Though clad in the homely garb of a farmer's wife, she had the calm bearing of conscious power, and an expression of quiet superiority which might have become a duchess. Her features were clear and regular, and from her broad brow the prematurely gray hair was combed back, and knotted at the back of the head, thus defining its antique outline and noble proportions.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph might have sat for the picture of Volumina going forth to meet her renegade son, though she had little fear that one of her race would ever prove untrue to the land of his birth. Tender and earnest was the look of affection that dwelt upon her beloved boy as he drew near, accompanied by one she feared was to become the blight upon his future, for she comprehended the depth and strength of her son's nature, and she mistrusted the truth of her who had inspired this precocious passion. Neither of them looked at her, for both felt that her piercing eye was upon them, and they dreaded her penetration.</p> 
               <p>Alina passed in, and Mrs. Rudolph's hand was laid softly upon the shoulder of her son, as she whispered:</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6349-00000016"/> 
               <p>"Do not permit the stranger to fathom the secret of your heart, my boy. See-he comes-cast off that look of care, and take your part in making his stay beneath our roof as pleasant as may be."</p> 
               <p>Michael started, looked an instant upon her face, and smiling with some effort, replied in a low tone:</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, mother; I was wrapped in my own thoughts, and forgetful of what others might see. I will talk with you to-night, and tell you what is weighing on my mind."</p> 
               <p>She nodded, smiled kindly in return, and hastened to take her place at the head of the well-supplied table. In honor of the strange guest, it was set out with antique china, ornamented with bouquets of gaily-painted flowers, which had been an heirloom in Mrs. Rudolph's family for several generations. The old-fashioned teapot and cream-jug were of silver, and were as bright and glittering as if just from the hands of the maker; and the tiny tea-spoons of the same metal bore upon them a knight's crest. De Vere was evidently surprised at these evidences of good taste in so humble a homestead, and he glanced with an expression of respectful deference at the noble-looking woman who welcomed him to the hospitality of her lowly home with the dignity of a high-born dame. He seated himself at her right hand, and in courtly phrase apologized for his intrusion beneath her roof.</p> 
               <p>"The stranger and the wayfarer are always welcome," she quietly replied; "and the friend of Miss Derval need make no apology for his brief visit to those who received her from her mother's hands."</p> 
               <p>At this allusion to her deceased mother, De Vere glanced toward the young lady who sat opposite to him. She seemed absorbed in thought; and his eye traveled on to Michael, who also looked like one in a vague dream, and a suspicion of the truth dawned on him. In his first interview with Alina he had scarcely remarked how attractive she was, but now his perceptions, quickened by a latent feeling of hostility toward the free-spoken youth who had already wounded his self-love, De Vere read the secret drama that was passing before him.</p> 
               <p>This yeoman's son had dared to lift his eyes to the daughter of a noble race, and she, young as she evidently was, had not frowned upon his presumptuous passion. This discovery furnished the key to the ambitious aspirations to which Rudolph had lately given utterance, and De Vere smiled as he thought how easily he could foil him, with the opportunities that lay before him. The repulsion of which Rudolph had spoken was mutual, and De Vere exulted in the thought that through his efforts this first pure and ardent affection should be crushed; be remembered throughout life as a dream of agony and despair; yet he talked on as pleasantly, as gaily, as if no thought of evil had entered his heart.</p> 
               <p>Gradually Alina listened and replied, and the brilliant glow of animation that lit up her features and kindled the bright flush of conscious admiration upon her transparent cheek, made De Vere think her charming-almost beautiful. Nor was the attraction of this stranger felt alone by the young girl, for he possessed a wonderful power to charm all who listened to the pleasant flow of his words. He was not a brilliant talker, but he had good sense, much cultivation, and great knowledge of life for a man yet under thirty. He had served in India, been thrown with various classes in life, and had learned something from all with whom he was thrown in contact. In addition to this, he had a vibrant, musical voice, which seemed to be the echo of a soul of far deeper sensibility than De Vere possessed.</p> 
               <p>Even Mrs. Rudolph, with her calm sense and accurate<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6349-00000017"/> judgment, felt the fascination of his manner; and she glanced from him to Alina with that quiet prescience which foreshadows probabilities in the future, and she marvelled if Michael foresaw the drama that might be now opening. His brow was shadowed, and his eyes troubled, and she felt for his present suffering, though seeing for him ultimate freedom from an entanglement she dreaded, she could scarcely have explained why.</p> 
               <p>When De Vere finished his tea he balanced the spoon upon his finger, and examined the crest stamped upon it. With a smile he turned to his hostess and said:</p> 
               <p>"Even without this evidence of gentle descent, madame, I should have inferred from your appearance and manners that you are of good lineage. Nature does not stamp her mark of nobility on those of plebeian blood."</p> 
               <p>A faint flush came upon the cheek of Mrs. Rudolph, and her eyes flashed with momentary pride; but it was quenched at once as they fell upon her husband, for he had no claim to knightly ancestry; and she felt that in his upright integrity, nice sense of honor, and tender strength of soul, few among the most lordly could be compared with him. She replied, with some reserve:</p> 
               <p>"Those spoons are an heirloom from my grandfather, who was the youngest son of a German baron. He left his father's roof to marry one so far below him in station that he was never forgiven. He accepted a peasant's lot for the sake of the wife he loved, and his descendants have claimed no higher position than he chose for himself."</p> 
               <p>"It is singular," replied De Vere, "how many offshoots from noble European families are found in the most humble sphere in this country. Every civilized nation and every class has its representative, and the people yet to spring from this intermingling of races, should, if physiology be true, be the greatest the world has yet seen. Yet I, an Englishman, believe it will be difficult for them to rise superior to the sons of Great Britain."</p> 
               <p>"They do not aspire to rise above them, only to claim an equality with them," said Mr. Rudolph, significantly, as he arose from the table, and led the way toward the outer room. De Vere merely bent his head in reply, and joining Alina, spoke to her with reference to her departure on the following morning.</p> 
               <p>He said:</p> 
               <p>"The weather promises to be fine, and a gallop of ten miles on horseback will not, I hope, fatigue you too much. We shall find a vessel awaiting our arrival, which trades to that point. The captain's wife is on board, so you will not be without female companionship."</p> 
               <p>"I am accustomed to riding even farther than that," she replied. "I shall be ready at the hour named, as I have but few preparations to make."</p> 
               <p>De Vere regarded her with a penetrating glance as he said:</p> 
               <p>"And I trust you will go without reluctance: the life that opens before you is very different from the dull monotony of this secluded place."</p> 
               <p>Alina's eyes wandered toward Michael, who was watching her keenly, and she hastily replied:</p> 
               <p>"I have been very happy here. They have all treated me as one of themselves, and I am sorry to leave them for an indefinite time, but-but my uncle has the strongest claim upon me, and when he bids me come to him, I must obey. Excuse me now-I must attend to the few preparations that are necessary for my departure."</p> 
               <p>He bowed profoundly, stepped back, and Alina glided rapidly toward her own apartment. This formed a small wing attached to the cottage, and in it every article of luxury possessed by the family had been placed for her accomodation<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6349-00000018"/> modation. A bed with its snowy covering and netted canopy stood in one corner; a wooden dressing-table, covered with a cloud of white drapery, above which hung an oval mirror, decorated with branches of cedar and bunches of holly-berries, occupied the opposite side. The walls were of rough-hewn logs, daubed with clay, but they had been carefully whitewashed, and over them hung many old and valuable engravings, the produce of German art, in frames of carved wood-work from the same source. A white curtain was drawn back from the only window, and a carpet woven by Mrs. Rudolph herself, covered the floor; a few comfortable chairs of rustic manufacture completed the furniture.</p> 
               <p>Several months had passed away since Alina Derval became the occupant of that room; she entered it in desolation and sorrow-she had been tenderly cared for by these good Samaritans, on whom she had no claim save that of humanity, and now she was about to go forth into the untried world, an orphan, and a dependent upon the kindness of her uncle. She sat down and wept a few bitter tears, but she was not one to grieve long over the inevitable. She presently wiped away her tears, and proceeded to pack up the few articles of value she possessed. In this occupation she soon forgot her sadness, and Rudolph, who watched beside her window for an opportunity to speak a few words with her, was heart-struck by hearing, at intervals, suppressed snatches of a song she often warbled. He bitterly muttered:</p> 
               <p>"She can sing, while my heart feels as if it is bursting! Oh, God! why do I love this girl so madly? I cannot lose her, yet she is going far from me with that smooth-spoken, deep-eyed villain. I hate him-<emph>I hate him.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>The poor youth clasped his hands over his features, and sobbed a refrain to the music. Let no heart scorn his weakness, for he was young and untried in the school of sorrow, and great tenderness of nature is often allied with the most heroic qualities.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">JEALOUSY.</head> 
               <p>ALINA DERVAL, though penniless and homeless, was the descendant of two noble families. Her father was the younger son of a French Count, and her mother the daughter of an Irish baronet. The fortune of the Derval family centered in the eldest son, and the younger brother was provided for in the army. He was ordered to Canada while that country was yet an appanage of the French crown; there he distinguished himself, and was promoted to the rank of colonel. A furlough enabled him to visit his native country, and in Paris he met with Captain Fitzhugh and his sister. The latter was a fair young girl just emancipated from the school-room: she spoke French with a charming accent, and was spirituelle and graceful, as most of her high-bred countrywomen are. The heart of the soldier, after a brief struggle, yielded itself captive to her attractions, and they were betrothed. Miss Fitzhugh had no fortune, and her lover had no dependence but his pay; but to a girl who had been reared in the seclusion of a provincial town, that seemed amply sufficient for every rational want, and Alina Fitzhugh accepted the hand of her handsome lover without anticipating objections on the part of her family.</p> 
               <p>They did oppose her marriage, for she was too delicate and lovely to be willingly surrendered to the life of wandering and privation she was ready to embrace. But all remonstrance proved vain. Alina was romantic, inexperienced in the struggles of life, and strongly attached to her betrothed. Her parents were both dead, and she was left dependent upon her elder brother, who already had a family of children to rear.</p> 
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6349-00000019"/> 
               <p>The younger brother, with whom she was traveling at the time she met with Colonel Derval, possessed a small independence, inherited from a deceased uncle, and a captain's commission in the British army. The beauty of his sister induced him to anticipate a brilliant establishment for her, and he had taken her on this unlucky tour in the hope that some wealthy lover might be attracted by her charms. With deep and bitter chagrin he at length yielded to her vehement entreaties not to separate her from the only man she could ever love, and undertook to reconcile their elder brother to the marriage. His consent was reluctantly wrung from Sir Leonard Fitzhugh, for he had looked to the future marriage of so lovely a girl to elevate his family importance, and give him a brother-in-law who could aid him to rise in political life.</p> 
               <p>Alina Fitzhugh became the wife of Colonel Derval, and after a brief honeymoon spent in Paris, parted from all she had hitherto known and loved to accompany him to the New World. It was a bitter trial, but she bore it bravely, for deep and strong was her attachment to her husband. In the first year of their union Alina was born at a frontier post of which Derval had the command. He provided for his wife's comfort as far as lay in his power, but the privations she was compelled to bear soon told upon her health and beauty. Other children, weak and fragile from their birth, were nursed through a few wailing months of suffering, and then consigned to a premature grave. Of the four given to them, only Alina lived; but the pale mother bore all with the patience of an angel. She cherished her one flower with deep maternal tenderness, and in her daughter's budding promise found consolation for the many bereavements she sustained. Through them all her husband's unvarying tenderness sustained her, though he too had changed greatly in the progress of time. Disappointed in his hopes of further promotion, imbittered by the struggles inseparable from narrow circumstances, Colonel Derval looked on life with a jaundiced eye, and railed at the neglect with which he was treated.</p> 
               <p>The struggle between Great Britain and France for the possession of Canada afforded him opportunities of distinction, but at a most important crisis a young officer was placed over him, whose orders he refused to obey. The most disastrous results flowed from his insurbordination; he was tried by a court-martial, and dismissed from the service.</p> 
               <p>Derval had forfeited all claims on the French government, and he was left, with a delicate wife and helpless child, absolutely without means of support. His disgrace affected him keenly-his habits had always been convivial, and, reckless of consequences, he now endeavored to drown the pangs of pride and the consciousness of ruin in the wine cup. Dire was the struggle for the next four years; the tears, the entreaties of his wife were unavailing to arrest his downward career. With failing health, she labored unceasingly with her needle to gain bread for herself and her child. Her friends assisted her at intervals, or she must have failed to secure even this: her brothers sent her small sums, which saved them from actual want, but they were far from knowing the extent of her destitution. Pride and affection for her husband prevented Mrs. Derval from making known to them the wretched habits into which he had fallen.</p> 
               <p>When all hope seemed lost, Captain, now Colonel Fitzhugh was sent to the colonies with his regiment. He sought out his sister, and was greatly shocked to find her in a small village in Maryland, whither they had wandered under some delusive hope of employment for Derval, maintaining herself and child by the scanty gains of her needle. Unable to do more for her, Fitzhugh rented a small cottage in<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6349-00000020"/> the country, to which was attached a few acres of ground, and allowed her from his pay a monthly stipend, which would place her above want.</p> 
               <p>At intervals he visited her, until his regiment was ordered to the southern part of Virginia, and then their intercourse was only maintained by letters. Alina had nearly completed her fourteenth year, when her unhappy father was killed by a fall from his horse; the shock laid her mother on a bed of sickness from which she never again arose, though she lingered for many months before death released her from suffering.</p> 
               <p>It was at this period that Mrs. Rudolph sought out the lonely stranger, and afforded her that assistance of which she stood so much in need. Hers was the voice that breathed consolation and hope to the stricken woman; hers the hand that was stretched forth to aid the dying stranger, and relieve her broken heart from its last care by taking under her protection the desolate orphan.</p> 
               <p>When the death angel at length claimed his own, the young girl was removed to the Glen, and found there such tender consideration for her bitter bereavement, that she was touched and penetrated by as deep a sense of gratitude as it was in her nature to feel. Alina at first grieved passionately over the loss of her mother, but the violence of her emotion soon exhausted itself, and, like the passing of a tropical storm, which leaves renewed beauty in its path, her sufferings only imparted deeper interest to her charms.</p> 
               <p>The child had merged into the woman, and a deeper power to fascinate, a vivid consciousness that her dower of youth, beauty, finesse and intellect were to win her way in the path that lay before her, dawned upon her. For the first time in her life she was now thrown with young persons of the opposite sex, and she soon became conscious that the brothers admired her. The natural coquetry of her disposition at first tempted her to encourage both, and find amusement in the jealousy she might thus arouse; but respect for Mrs. Rudolph withheld her from this course, and something in the character of the younger brother also warned her that she would be playing a dangerous game to attempt to trifle with his affections.</p> 
               <p>In spite of her efforts to remain indifferent, Michael, with his grand simplicity of nature, and deep enthusiasm of feeling, won upon her regard until she believed she loved him. She listened complacently to his passionate avowals, encouraged his aspirations after a position worthy of her acceptance, and, as we have seen, pledged herself, when won, to share it with him.</p> 
               <p>Rupert, whose character was of a different mould from his brother's, soon withdrew from the competition for her favor. He comprehended Alina better than the impulsive Michael, and felt assured that as a wife she would suit neither of them. Her training had not been like theirs; her friends would naturally look higher for her, and he congratulated himself on his own escape from the net which had entangled his brother.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph, with her deep insight into character, read every phase of Alina's nature, and with deep pain she saw her beloved boy yield himself utterly to her fascinations. She felt a tender and compassionate regard for the friendless girl thus thrown on her protection, but the thought that her noble and highly gifted son should devote to her all the wealth of his impassioned nature, possibly to be met with scorn, and trampled on in the future, caused her bitter pain.</p> 
               <p>From Michael's infancy, his mother had watched the development of his fiery, high-toned spirit with intense solicitude. She recognized the lofty nobility of his nature, and confidently believed the prediction so singularly uttered would in time be realized. The narrow boundaries of his<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6349-00000021"/> humble home could not long confine a young eagle whose wings were ready to soar to the empyrean. All the mother's ambitious hopes centred in him, and she saw, with regret, how entirely he was enthralled by this young girl, whose depth of nature, whose sincerity, she mistrusted. Mrs. Rudolph did justice to the grace and sweetness of Alina, but beneath this fair surface, she felt, lay passions yet undeveloped; impulses that might lead her far astray; and she mourned for the infatuation of her son. Remonstrance was useless-Rudolph was madly in love, and he believed his affection returned; therefore his mother judiciously held her peace, and left future events to work out their own fulfilment.</p> 
               <p>Immediately after the death of Mrs. Derval, a letter had been dispatched to Colonel Fitzhugh, informing him of the event; but he was absent from his post at the time of its arrival, and four months elapsed before he took measures to place his niece under his own protection. Mrs. Rudolph welcomed the appearance of De Vere as the signal of the release of her son, and fond as she had become of Alina, she was glad to restore her to the care of her own family.</p> 
               <p>When his burst of jealousy and rage exhausted itself, Rudolph wiped away his tears with a feeling of self-contempt, and walked about the yard till he obtained complete mastery over himself. Then he sought his mother, as he had promised.</p> 
               <p>Night had now fallen, and Mrs. Rudolph, the cares of the day over, was seated in her own chamber awaiting his appearance. Her husband and elder son were with the stranger in the outer apartment, and their voices were still heard in animated discussion over the disturbed condition of the country. Rudolph threw himself upon a chair, and shaded his face with his hand, that his mother might not read too much of the struggle that was passing within him. She quietly removed the candle to such a position as left his head in shadow, and then said:</p> 
               <p>"The first trial of your life has come, my son, but you have strength to bear it as a man should. You love this young stranger, and she <emph>believes</emph> she loves you."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Believes,</emph> dear mother! Oh, if it is a belief, and not a deep and earnest reality, I am lost! lost! lost!"</p> 
               <p>There was a depth of dreary vehemence in his tones that deeply affected her, and she laid her hand tenderly upon his arm:</p> 
               <p>"No, my son-not lost, but strengthened and elevated by the trials that are never sent without a purpose. If it is the will of a higher power that you shall meet with disappointment in the first and sweetest dream of youth, it will be only to prepare you for the battle of life. The promise of a noble nature is not to be blighted by the inconstancy of a light and fickle one."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph regarded her with dilating eyes, and his broad chest heaved with irrepressible emotion as he spoke, almost harshly:</p> 
               <p>"Mother, why do you so hardly judge Alina? She has pledged herself to wait for me till I can win the right to claim her. Is not that sufficient proof that she loves me?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph compassionately regarded him, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"Alina is not the mistress of her own destiny. She is too young to know her own mind in a matter of such vital importance, and her uncle will expect her to choose a husband whose position in life is far higher than yours. You have your way to win amid discouragements and difficulties, and while you are struggling toward independence, this young girl will gain worldly wisdom to show her that her path does not lie parallel with yours. My son, I know<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6349-00000022"/> that this is a bitter truth, but it is my duty to speak it to you."</p> 
               <p>"Mother, you torture me," groaned the poor youth. "I came to you for consolation and hope and you pour coals of fire upon my heart. I have weighed all these obstacles, and I have felt that I can overcome them if Alina will only prove true. Do not tell me she will retract, for there lies despair--"</p> 
               <p>Michael threw his arms across the table, and bent his face upon them to conceal the emotion that convulsed his features. His mother arose and stood beside him; after a pause, she softly said:</p> 
               <p>"My son, I may wrong Alina. I trust I do, for your dear sake. Hope on, love on; it will give you a purpose in life, and nerve you for the contest every true man must wage whose fortune is to be won by his own right hand. Since you love this young girl thus, I am unwilling to believe that she will prove unworthy of such a heart as yours. Your nature will elevate hers, and in time, she may become your true mate. There, lad, rouse up, and meet the present manfully; from sorrow the flower of joy shall spring up in the future, as surely as the grass puts up after the shower."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph listened to her soothing words; the very tones of her mild and even voice had power over him, and he struggled against the tempest of emotion that surged so wildly within his bosom. He presently raised his head, and placing his feverish hand in that which sought to clasp it, feebly said:</p> 
               <p>"Mother, you think me very weak, you regard me as a boy without strength of will to carry out my purposes in defiance to opposition; but it is not so. The fiery deluge of passion that surges through my soul has swept away all childish feeling. I love as a man, I will struggle as a man, and conquer fate itself!"</p> 
                
               <p>"If Alina loves you truly all will be well," confidently replied his mother, who began to feel the necessity of soothing his excitement.</p> 
               <p>"Mother, she is, she must be true, or your son is lost to you forever. Disappointed in her love, I will seek death, or expatriation. Every association of the past I would seek to blot out which could recal the fatal dream that so maddens my heart."</p> 
               <p>"Fatal, indeed, if you can thus speak of relinquishing the ties of home and family affection, through disappointment in one who has been known to you but a few brief months. I did not expect this return for all the tender love I have lavished on you, Michael."</p> 
               <p>The wild anguish of the youth was checked, and his tender feelings touched by the mournful accents of his mother's voice. He grasped her hand, as he impulsively said:</p> 
               <p>"My mother, my best, and truest friend, pardon my selfishness. While <emph>you</emph> live, I shall not be desolate, even if this true love be thwarted. Yes-from your noble heart, and gentle counsels, I shall gain courage to bear all that God may send."</p> 
               <p>"Amen, my son. Be strong in the faith I have endeavored to give you, and you will conquer in the strife. You have my blessings, and my prayers, and the All Father will not close his ears to the petitions of a loving mother for the child on whom He has bestowed great gifts for a purpose known to Himself alone. Go upon your appointed path; the first blow has been struck for freedom; the flames will soon spread until it envelopes the whole land, and God the merciful, will give the victory to the right."</p> 
               <p>She stood with one hand partly raised, the light streaming full upon her fine face, which was pale with emotion, though full of the inspiration of heroism. Rudolph looked on her with reverential awe; his brow cleared, a martial fire<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6349-00000023"/> gleamed in his eyes, and he raised himself to his full height, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"You bid me strike in the cause of freedom. Thanks, my noble mother; from your lips I have learned the legends of your father land, and they have inspired me with the ambition to emulate the deeds of its heroes. I pledge myself to sustain the cause of my country till victory is won, and peace again smiles upon the soil freed from the invader's tread."</p> 
               <p>He held out his hand, which his mother clasped in one of her own, and laid the other upon his head, while she solemnly said:</p> 
               <p>"I dedicate you, child of my heart, to the glorious cause of freedom. Go to the battle's front, and strike for all that is dear to man. You may seal your devotion to your country with your blood, yet I seek not to withhold you, for in this hour every man should buckle on his sword, and make her cause his own. The blessing of the youngest born shall abide with you, as with Jacob of old."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph sank upon his knees and reverently kissed the hand that clasped his own. He then arose, calmed and elevated. The passion that had lately shook his soul seemed dwarfed and common-place, beside the duties that devolved upon him as one of a great people commissioned by Heaven itself to show the nations of the earth their mighty power to conquer and to rule. He looked into his mother's eyes; soul met soul in that mute exchange of feeling, and the son was clasped to her breast, while a wordless prayer for protection arose from her heart, and a vow of self-devotion to the cause he was about to espouse, from his. It was a sublime consecration to duty, worthy to be classed with Spartan heroism.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph turned away, and left the room. His mother remained alone to recover calmness and self-control for the interview she intended to seek with Alina.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
                
               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BROTHER'S WARNING.</head> 
               <p>AT the end of half an hour Mrs. Rudolph tapped upon the door of Alina's room, and the heart of the mother was somewhat reassured when she saw the traces of recent tears upon the young girl's face. She endeavored to conceal them, and hastened to place a seat for her visitor, while she sedulously turned from the candle that its light might not reveal the emotion she really felt. After a pause, Mrs. Rudolph said:</p> 
               <p>"My child, we are sorry to part from you. In the absence of any daughter of my own, your presence has brightened our home; but the time will come, Alina, in which I can welcome you as the daughter of my heart. Is it not so?"</p> 
               <p>Alina answered in a faint voice:</p> 
               <p>"A pledge has passed between Michael and myself to that effect; but if he persists in his intention to espouse a cause that is almost desperate, I have many doubts and misgivings as to the future."</p> 
               <p>"Why shall the battle for right and justice be deemed desperate before it is scarcely commenced?" asked the elder lady, with slight asperity. "Alina, if your love for my son is based on his probable success in life, it is not that affection which will bear the test of time and misfortune. You are too young to be bound by any promise you may now make, and too dependent on others to render it right for us to hold you responsible for what may happen in the future; but the lad loves you as few men can love, and your desertion will inflict upon him a blow that must affect him throughout his life. I, his mother, ask you to weigh well<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6349-00000024"/> the ambitious hopes that may soon dawn upon you; to give full play to the real feelings of your heart, and never to bestow your hand upon another, unless that heart is utterly estranged from him to whom you have given your first promise. Will you pledge yourself to this?"</p> 
               <p>"I do-I will. I feel sure that Michael will gain such a position as will entitle him to claim my plighted troth. Ah! if he would only join the British army, I should feel the certainty that in a few years he would be where I wish to see him-at the head of a company of his own."</p> 
               <p>"No son of mine shall enroll himself under the standard of the oppressor, though the tenderest hopes of his heart be wrecked by espousing the cause of his country," replied Mrs. Rudolph, proudly. "You must make up your mind to become the wife of an American, or relinquish the love of as noble and tender a heart as beats in a human bosom. If you love Michael as he deserves, you will not hesitate when the hour for a final decision arrives. You are yet almost a child in years, but you have more character than most girls of your age. You have awakened a passion in a high-toned being, which must influence all his future years, therefore I ask of you to pause when temptation assails you; recall the days you have passed beneath this roof, and ask your own heart if it recoils from the sacrifice you must make in becoming the bride of my son. He has everything to win-fame, fortune, and position; can you wait cheerfully, hoping on, trusting on, till a brighter day dawns upon the cause to which he must devote himself? If you can do this, happiness will be yours. If you falter, if you lose faith in him, if your love grows cold in absence, Michael will deeply suffer; but he will survive it. Such souls of fire are not quenched by the inconstancy of any woman, however adored she may be. If such a change should come over you, tell him the truth at once. It will be a bitter blow, but he will have strength to sustain it, or he would be no son of mine."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, madam, why should you thus cruelly probe my heart?" exclaimed Alina, passionately. "Is it not enough that I am going away from Michael, feeling that I love him sincerely, without being tortured by such suspicions? I shall redeem my pledge by becoming your son's wife; what more can I say to set your fears at rest?"</p> 
               <p>"May God keep you in this mind; in His hands I leave the issue," said Mrs. Rudolph, in tremulous accents. "It may be wrong to seek to bind you by any promise, but so much is at stake for one who is dear to me as the pulse of my own heart, that I risk the condemnation of my conscience in seeking this assurance from you. Under other circumstances, I should be wronging you; but we are on the eve of great events, and by the time you are of an age to marry, my boy will have won his reward, or be numbered with the heroes who die for the right."</p> 
               <p>Alina was touched; she earnestly said:</p> 
               <p>"And my hero he shall remain, either living or dead. Set your heart at rest, dear Mrs. Rudolph, and teach Michael to have that faith in me which I shall have in him. You will yet welcome me to the old homestead as your daughter; and in the years of my absence, I shall fondly remember the kindness which I have received beneath your roof. Accept my warmest thanks, and be assured that while life lasts, I shall gratefully remember all that you have done, both for my mother and myself."</p> 
               <p>The graceful charm with which these words were spoken it is impossible to express; this inexplicable attraction was Alina's birthright; the cestus of Venus which gave her her chief power to fascinate. Mrs. Rudolph tenderly kissed her, and after a pause, the young girl said:</p> 
               <p>"I have been looking over some keepsakes that once<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6349-00000025"/> belonged to my mother, and the sad memories they evoked caused me to shed some tears. For years we led a wandering and wretched life, and they recalled so much of her suffering that I was forced to weep as I looked upon them for the last time."</p> 
               <p>"But why the last time, my child? You will surely take with you such trifles as will bring the memory of your mother vividly before you."</p> 
               <p>"No," replied Alina, with a pained expression, "I cannot. I do not willingly recall that which makes me unhappy. Life is too short to be filled with bitter memories, even if they are connected with the beloved dead. The fate of my father, the sufferings of my mother, I would bury in oblivion, if the power to forget were mine. Everything that can recall the recollection of those years of humiliation, I desire to put far from me; therefore I wish to leave these souvenirs behind me. I will give them into your care, dear madam, and feel that they will be far safer than with me, in the uncertain and wandering life I shall probably lead with my uncle's family."</p> 
               <p>"If you do this to ensure their safe-keeping, Alina, I will gladly undertake the charge; but if you part from them through the feeling of weakness to which you have referred, I must express my deep regret that you should indulge it. Alas! my child, to shrink from pain is not the way to conquer the evil that must mingle with every human lot."</p> 
               <p>Tears gathered in Alina's eyes, through which a latent gleam of fire flashed as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"It is my nature to shrink from suffering, and when I can put from me that which is past and gone I must do so. God has given me a great capacity for enjoyment, why then shall I mar his intent by doing that which will bring a cloud over my own happiness? No-no-I will leave behind me all that can bring back the wretched past to my memory."</p> 
                
               <p>This characteristic revelation was intensely painful to the listener, for it showed her more vividly than before the wide contrast between these two natures which had been so unfortunately attracted toward each other. But Mrs. Rudolph felt that remonstrance would be useless, for Alina had spoken the truth of herself. Sorrowfully she comprehended that there was no depth, no strength in the soul which had so deeply enthralled her precious boy. What the future would bring forth from this inauspicious entanglement she could not foresee; she could only pray that neither blight nor evil to her young hero should spring from it, for such in her imagination her son already was. She coldly answered:</p> 
               <p>"I will not refuse the charge you wish to confide to me. Alina; should you desire to have these things restored to you, you need only notify me and they shall be safely forwarded to you."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, madam; I expected as much of your kindness. I have sealed up a package of letters which passed between my mother and her family. Her journal also, and the few books she left, I wish to place in your charge. Her miniature, and that of my uncle, Count Armand Derval, I shall take with me."</p> 
               <p>Alina arose and took from her trunk the articles to which she referred. There were six books which bore marks of constant use-a Bible and prayer-book, with notes on nearly every page, many of which had evidently been blistered with tears-Shakespeare, Jeremy Taylor, and two other works of a devotional character. Mrs. Rudolph opened the Bible, and her voice faltered as she said:</p> 
               <p>"You surely will not part with this. These notes are almost a record of your mother's inner life. Oh! my child, this book, if daily studied by you, will keep you in the straight path which leads to peace on earth, and happiness<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6349-00000026"/> in the life that is to come. These notes will be as the voice of your mother speaking to you from beyond the grave; they will give you comfort and courage in the darkest hours of your life. Take this Bible and prayer-book with you, I entreat."</p> 
               <p>Alina listened to this appeal with heaving bosom and quivering lips. After a struggle, she said:</p> 
               <p>"I cannot-every page is associated with such humiliation to me, that the mere sight of them is as a stab to my heart. I have a Bible and prayer-book of my own, and they will suffice. If dark hours come to me, as you predict, I must bear them with my own strength. The sight of these things could only make my suffering deeper. Do not think me hard and heartless, for I am only sensitive, and resolute to place far from me that which recalls anguish that has already been endured. The sad fate of my parents has been long enough an incubus upon me; I go to brighter scenes-fairer hopes dawn upon me, and I wish to forget, as far as may be, the gloom that has shadowed my young life. Judge me not harshly, for I feel that I do not deserve it."</p> 
               <p>She looked pleadingly in the face of Mrs. Rudolph, who could not resist the appeal, though she felt that the being who thus shrank from the past would scarcely develop into such a woman as she was willing to see her son's wife. She merely said:</p> 
               <p>"I will take the best care of these things, Alina, and I will endeavor to obey the injunction which enjoins us to 'judge not lest we be judged.' My affection for you leads me to be as lenient as possible to your failings."</p> 
               <p>Alina thanked her with animation, and presently, with a smile as brilliant as if no sorrow had lately touched her, she took up her uncle's miniature, and said:</p> 
               <p>"This is Count Derval in his court dress. He holds an office about the person of the king, and lives in the palace. Ah! if <emph>he</emph> had proposed to take me under his protection, I might have hoped to be the means of bringing to pass the predictions of the astrologer with regard to Michael."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph took the picture and looked on the handsome man it represented in the brilliant costume of a nobleman of the ancient <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rgime.</foreign> The face was haughty and the expression cold, though she could trace a strong resemblance to his niece in the brow and the finely formed mouth. She quietly said:</p> 
               <p>"My son will be the architect of his own fortune, Alina, though I thank you for the wish to serve him. If you were transferred to the French court, a marriage of convenience would soon be arranged for you, and the hopes of Michael crushed in the bud. In all your father's difficulties I believe his brother afforded him no assistance."</p> 
               <p>"No-the more shame to him," was the indignant response. "He replied to none of the letters sent to him, and if it had not been for my Uncle Fitzhugh we must have perished of want. I will at least try and shew him that I am not ungrateful."</p> 
               <p>"Colonel Fitzhugh must be a man of kind feeling and noble impulses; you will be safer with him than if thrown amid the corruptions of a foreign court, with no mother to watch over you."</p> 
               <p>A faint cloud crossed the brow of the listener, and she decisively said:</p> 
               <p>"Yet I would have risked it. I can take care of myself, and turn events to my own purposes. Haughty as the original of this picture must be, I am sure that I could mould him to my will; but my Uncle Fitzhugh is a bold soldier, who makes man, woman and child alike yield to his sway. I shall be forced to do what he thinks is right, without reference to my own wishes."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better for you, Alina, for I know that he<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6349-00000027"/> is an honorable and high-toned man. Follow his guidance and you will be safe."</p> 
               <p>A subtle smile flitted over the girl's lips, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"I have already done that which, if known to him, would arouse his deepest displeasure. My uncle will scarcely approve of my promise to marry one who will array himself in arms against the cause to which he is devoted. A suspicion that I have done so would be the death-blow to Michael's hopes."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph listened with pain. After a pause she said:</p> 
               <p>"Deception of any kind is wrong; yet this seems a case in which it is impossible to avoid it. I repeat that you are not bound to my son by any promise you have made; your own sense of right must guide you in your future course, both toward Michael and your uncle. It is unfortunate that you should have loved each other, but having done so, all we can now do is to leave the issue in the hands of Him 'who doeth all things well."</p> 
               <p>She arose, feeling sore at heart, and gathered the books and manuscripts together; how Alina could part from the last, the record of her mother's hopes and fears-of her tender prayers for her future welfare, she could not understand; for penetrating as Mrs. Rudolph was, the character of this unformed girl was an enigma to her. It was one she feared to solve, for she had deep misgivings for the future: she prepared to leave the room as she said:</p> 
               <p>"When you call for these things they shall be delivered safely to you."</p> 
               <p>A few moments after Mrs. Rudolph's departure, a light tap was struck upon the window, and obedient to the signal, Alina wrapped a shawl over her head and shoulders, and joined Michael, who awaited her at the door. She walked with him beneath the shadow of the trees till a late hour of the night: what passed in that interview was but a repetition of what had gone before-passion, jealousy, and renewed hope to the young lover's heart. Alina used all her power in this last interview to rivet the chain she had thrown over him; she played on every emotion of that excitable nature, and ended her caprices by placing her hand in his, and taking a solemn vow to wed none but him-to defy importunity, baffle opposition, and, if necessary, even to evade the authority of her uncle when the hour arrived in which her lover could demand of her the fulfilment of her troth.</p> 
               <p>Hand in hand they at length drew near the house, for the hour of midnight had sounded from the old-fashioned clock that stood in the dining room, and its resonant peal penetrated even to the leafy covert beneath which they wandered. Alina hastily whispered:</p> 
               <p>"I hope you are satisfied now with my promise, Michael. In Scotland a witness would only have been wanting to make our betrothal a legal marriage."</p> 
               <p>"True, but we are not in Scotland, and there <emph>was</emph> no witness to our pledges, but the recording angel has not forgotten them; they are registered, and they shall yet be sealed by the voice of a minister of God-yet with this certainty, there is a strange unrest in my soul; a vague dread that I have never before felt-of what can it be ominous, Alina?"</p> 
               <p>Alina laughed mockingly:</p> 
               <p>"It is only that you hate the thought of seeing me depart under the protection of this young officer. You can also go with me to the Point, and see me safe under the wing of the captain's wife; I am sorry that you cannot implicitly trust your betrothed wife, Michael."</p> 
               <p>"You mistake me," he seriously replied. "It is not jealousy that oppresses me; after the sacred pledge you have just given me, I should be base to doubt you. I feel<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6349-00000028"/> as if a spirit of evil is breathing around me, ready to lay his clutch upon my fate-Alina, beware of this stranger, or what I foretold to you will surely come to pass-his life-blood or mine will be offered as a sacrifice, if you lend a favorable ear to his flatteries."</p> 
               <p>"There-I told you it was jealousy. Good night-I must sleep before setting out on my journey."</p> 
               <p>"Sleep-I shall not sleep to-night, though I am glad that you can rest before the fatigue of to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>There was bitterness in his tone, but his companion did not choose to remark it-she held out her hand, bent her head toward him, and in soft accents said:</p> 
               <p>"Take your farewell, now, for to-morrow we must be guarded before others."</p> 
               <p>Michael drew her to his beating heart, pressed her tenderly and reverently in his strong arms, and kissed her cheeks, lips, and brow with passionate fervor. With a sudden movement, Alina released herself and disappeared within the house.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph did not attempt to sleep that night. He passed its remaining hours in pacing to and fro upon the same path so lately trod with Alina, recalling the pledges she had made, and vainly trying to assure himself that she would prove true through every trial. Toward morning he returned to the house, and threw himself for an hour beside his brother, who was sleeping soundly; but no slumber came to seal the eyes of the restless and excited youth.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE DEFIANCE.</head> 
               <p>THE following morning arose in cloudless lustre; the tender leaves of the budding forest, with their varied shades of green, seemed hourly bursting into new beauty beneath the warm sunbeams. A soft air, with promise of coming summer in its genial warmth, fluttered among the early flowers, and the birds sang their glad pans over the season of plenty and enjoyment that lay before them.</p> 
               <p>At an early hour the household at the Glen were astir, and before the sun had fairly shown his red disc above the horizon, a substantial breakfast was served, and the horses of the travelers were at the door. Alina, looking fresh and bright in spite of her nocturnal rambles, made her appearance at the sound of the breakfast bell, and took her usual place near the mistress of the family. Such conversation as passed was addressed to her, for she was the central object of interest to them all.</p> 
               <p>Toward the close of the meal, Mr. Rudolph jocularly said:</p> 
               <p>"You are running into temptation, my pretty lass, for a young girl like you will find scores of lovers among the young officers that will soon surround you. Look sharp that some one does not run off with your heart before you are old enough to make a wise choice."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you for the caution," she replied, with a smile, "But my heart is pretty well guarded," and she glanced furtively toward Michael, who had listened with compressed lips and restless movements to this untoward remark of his father. The glance was caught by De Vere, and he drew his own inferences from it.</p> 
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6349-00000029"/> 
               <p>"Guarded! by what!" asked the old man. "Not by experience, I am sure, for you are too young to have any; but I dare say your uncle will take all proper care of you. May you be happy in your new home, my child; but if things should go wrong with you, remember that you always have a home beneath my roof. It is an humble but an honest one, and will be open to you under any and all circumstances."</p> 
               <p>Alina cast a grateful glance at the speaker, and her voice was tremulous as she uttered her thanks; but De Vere spoke with some hauteur:</p> 
               <p>"Colonel Fitzhugh will provide for his niece's future happiness and well being. It will never be necessary for her to seek another protector till she chooses one for life. Your kindness to her in her bereavement is properly appreciated, and he commissioned me to offer such an equivalent as may be acceptable."</p> 
               <p>He arose from the table, and drew forth a well-filled pocket book. A glance of fire shot from Michael's eyes, and with difficulty he restrained himself. His father saw his excitement, and with a deprecating motion of his hand kept him silent. The old man also arose, and with simple dignity said:</p> 
               <p>"The good Samaritan found his reward in well-doing; the little that I can do in fulfilment of my Master's commands is not to be paid for in British gold. Alina Derval has been as welcome beneath my roof as if she were my own child. Put up your money, young man, for I shall not soil my hands by touching it."</p> 
               <p>"But this is an obligation Colonel Fitzhugh will not be willing to remain under. He is able to pay for all you have done for Miss Derval, and anxious to do so."</p> 
               <p>Alina started forward, laid her hand upon his arm, and spoke in low, earnest tones:</p> 
                
               <p>"Do not press this subject, if you please. Money can never repay the kindness which has been extended to me here. It is an insult to these noble people to offer it. I will explain to my uncle-he will understand their scruples."</p> 
               <p>De Vere bowed with a sarcastic curl of his lip, and replaced the gold he had taken out. With graceful sweetness Alina approached Mr. Rudolph, placed her hand in his, and said:</p> 
               <p>"You and your wife have been friends to me when I most needed them. I shall never forget your kindness, nor the offer you have this day made me. Farewell, dear sir; remember your little friend with tenderness, for she will ever retain a fond remembrance of the gentle hearts that soothed the grief of the homeless and orphaned stranger."</p> 
               <p>The old man placed his hand upon her head, and the cloud passed from his brow, as he reverently said:</p> 
               <p>"May the God of our fathers be with and protect you, my dear child. I shall remember you tenderly, and pray for you earnestly. I trust that on earth your fate will be happy, and in Heaven, may you shine as a bright angel beside your lovely mother."</p> 
               <p>At that moment Alina felt as if she would strive to deserve that blessing-she turned away with tears in her eyes, and was clasped in a long embrace to the maternal heart of Mrs. Rudolph. A few loving words were whispered, and she turned and gave her hand to Rupert to conduct her to her horse. He placed her in the saddle, and pressing her hand, said in a low voice:</p> 
               <p>"I do not say much, Alina; but I am your fast friend, and that of my brother. Beware how you trifle with so fiery a nature as his. Be true, as you value your happiness."</p> 
               <p>A flush crossed her cheek, and she spoke with some pique:</p> 
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6349-00000030"/> 
               <p>"Then Michael has betrayed--"</p> 
               <p>"He has betrayed nothing. I have only seen for myself. I only warn you of possibilities-I can do no more."</p> 
               <p>Captain De Vere, mounted on a coal black charger, magnificently caparisoned, reined up beside them, and Alina could only say:</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, and good-bye; I shall remember."</p> 
               <p>She looked around for Michael, but he was nowhere to be seen; and hastily drawing down her veil to conceal the expression of disappointment that swept over her face, she waved her hand to the group in front of the house, and put her horse in such rapid motion, that it required a pursuit of several moments before her cavalier gained her side.</p> 
               <p>Alina swept onward, heedless of the attempts of De Vere to open a conversation with her. She replied to him in monosyllables, and did not pause in her rapid career till they came to a cross-road, where Michael, mounted on a powerful roan horse, sat quietly awaiting them. He had quite recovered his usual composure, and with a smile, said:</p> 
               <p>"While you were telling them good-by, I came by a short cut to this point. It is necessary to take back your horse, and I preferred performing this last service for you myself."</p> 
               <p>The veil was lifted for a brief moment, and a flash from her beaming eyes thanked him, though she said nothing.</p> 
               <p>De Vere remarked:</p> 
               <p>"That was well thought of, young sir; but since you have started with us, I would fain take you on, and delegate to some other person the task of returning the horses."</p> 
               <p>"Whither would you have me go?" asked Rudolph, feigning to misunderstand his meaning.</p> 
               <p>"At such a crisis as the present, there is but one duty that is plain to every loyal man. You should take up arms without delay."</p> 
                
               <p>"Such is my purpose. I supposed you understood that already."</p> 
               <p>"Embrace the bright side, and I offer you a position in my own troop. They are bold rangers, well-mounted, and I think I can soon secure the office of sergeant for so fine a fellow as you are."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," replied Rudolph, drily; but I hope to gain a higher position than that in the corps to which I shall offer my services."</p> 
               <p>"Higher? I think this would be a great step for a friendless young yeoman, who has had no military training. You possess nothing to entitle you to a better position than would be given to any other volunteer."</p> 
               <p>"True enough; but it is all here, and it shall come out," said Rudolph, significantly touching his forehead. "We shall yet measure swords, Captain De Vere, and you will have an opportunity to see what nature has done for the untutored country lad. I do not boast, but if my life is spared, I shall yet make my name known as the defender of my country's rights."</p> 
               <p>De Vere laughed scornfully:</p> 
               <p>"To listen to the malapert braggadocio of the sons of this soil, one would suppose that all they have to do is, to band together in predatory warfare, and drive the veterans of old England before them! We <emph>may</emph> meet in battle, young man, and then a lesson will be taught that will be long remembered."</p> 
               <p>"I quite agree with you-but you and your brother officers will be the learners. The struggle may be long, and at times disheartening, but men resolute to maintain their independence <emph>must</emph> be victorious in the end."</p> 
               <p>There was a calm, conscious power in the manner of the speaker, that elicited the respect of De Vere, in spite of his desire to treat him as an inferior. The tone in which he again spoke was less offensive:</p> 
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6349-00000031"/> 
               <p>"I do not undervalue the courage of the Americans, for they are of the same race from which I am myself descended; but I deeply regret this mad outbreak, leading, as it must, to ruin to the people, and ending in their final subjugation."</p> 
               <p>"You expressed the same opinion last evening, and I then told you that I have the hardihood to differ from you. We can but try our strength, and leave the issue to a higher power."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph fell back, to avoid further conversation. His eyes followed the form of Alina, and he remarked with pleasure that she seemed scarcely to reply to the words addressed to her by the young officer. She had slackened her pace when her lover joined them, but now she put her spirited steed to his best pace, and rode onward as if seeking in rapid motion to still the unquiet thoughts that filled her mind.</p> 
               <p>At length they came in sight of the bay, with its restless waters glittering in the sunbeams, and here and there a white sail <choice>
                     <sic>fltting</sic>
                     <corr>flitting</corr>
                  </choice> over them. After skirting the shore a few miles, the little party approached a sheltered cove in which lay a schooner at anchor. The English flag was flying from the masthead, and De Vere pointed to it, as he said to Rudolph:</p> 
               <p>"There is the standard that will never be lowered at the bidding of a band of black-hearted rebels. Its folds have sheltered all that is of promise to human rights, and, God willing, it shall yet wave in triumph over this recusant land."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph, in his deep ringing tones, replied:</p> 
               <p>"And God willing, the children of the grand old mother shall prove themselves worthy to be her offspring. When she tries might against right, the great Jehovah will be on the side of those who battle for all that is dear to man. I devote myself to the forlorn hope, as you evidently think it, Captain De Vere, for I am resolute to rise or fall with my country."</p> 
               <p>"Then be the consequences on your own head. For the kindness of your family to Miss Derval, her uncle would have made you his especial proteg. Your rise would have been as rapid as your ambition could have desired, and thus Colonel Fitzhugh would have repaid the debt he has incurred."</p> 
               <p>"Let not the obligation burden him," replied Rudolph. "It is we who have been favored by being of some little service to Colonel Fitzhugh's niece. We ask nothing-will accept nothing as an equivalent for the courtesy we have been able to show her."</p> 
               <p>Alina here checked her steed, and putting back her veil, turned her face glowing with the exercise of the morning, toward the speaker. She assumed her most persuasive expression as she said:</p> 
               <p>"Yet, Michael, if you would only listen to reason. If you would not be so strong-willed in this crisis, it might be in my power to aid you to rise to your true position. My uncle has power; let him use his influence in your behalf, and you will at once be placed on the road to distinction."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph regarded her steadily and mournfully. After a pause, which caused her heart to beat painfully, he said:</p> 
               <p>"After all that has passed, I scarcely expected such an appeal from Miss Derval. Among my countrymen, I shall be considered an equal, though bearing a subordinate rank; among those of Colonel Fitzhugh, I should still be regarded as an interloper, and inferior, even after my tried gallantry entitled me to the highest rewards. No-for the equal rights of man <emph>as man,</emph> I draw my sword, or it remains for ever sheathed. Such is my irrevocable determination."</p> 
               <p>He turned away his head that he might not see that<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6349-00000032"/> pleading face, which it was so difficult to resist, and while De Vere assisted Alina to alight from her horse, he busied himself in removing the portmanteau in which was packed the few articles she had brought with her. Two men appeared on the deck of the vessel, and hastened to put out a narrow gangway, which rested on a projection of the shore. The path that led to it was steep and winding, and De Vere assiduously aided the young girl in her descent. Rudolph sprang over the bank, and stood ready to assist Alina to reach the deck; but De Vere unceremoniously put him aside, and stepped with her on the frail plank that vibrated in the most alarming manner. Suddenly the vessel careened slightly, and Alina was precipitated into the water. De Vere had not presence of mind to arrest her fall, and pallid and trembling he exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"I cannot swim-twenty pounds to him who will save the young lady."</p> 
               <p>Before these words were uttered Rudolph had thrown off his coat, and was plunging into the bay."</p> 
               <p>"Lower the boat," shouted the captain. "Thar's an eddy thar, and they'll both be lost without speedy help."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph struck out with his powerful arms, but the seconds that elapsed before Alina arose to the surface seemed to him an age. A dark speck appeared, then a pale face with radiant hair falling in wet masses around it, gleamed an instant above the waves, but it again sank from his sight just as his arms were stretched forth to grasp her form.</p> 
               <p>With a voiceless prayer for help in this extremity, Rudolph firmly closed his lips, and dived after her. He succeeded in grasping her dress as she was again rising to the surface, and they once more appeared to the straining vision of those who were watching for them. The strong swimmer struck out manfully for the shore, but he had been drifted out by the ebbing tide, and he felt that a powerful counter current was drawing him into its vortex. A few more moments, and Rudolph felt that his strength would not avail him against the power of this mighty foe, and with one look of anguish upon the pale face that rested on his breast, one cry for help in this extremity, he took what he believed to be his last look upon the bright sun and fair world around him: then he was borne amid the strife of waters, drifting at their mercy, though he still struggled to keep himself from sinking with his precious burden.</p> 
               <p>The boat, pulled with vigorous strokes, reached the spot just as they were disappearing, and with a shout the captain grasped the hair of Rudolph, and with the aid of his companion, drew him from the water, with Alina still clasped to his breast.</p> 
               <p>After a few struggles for breath, consciousness returned to him, and then his first care was for her. She lay before him quite insensible, and his wild cry of anguish was answered by the captain:</p> 
               <p>"Never fear, youngster; she'll come round in a few minutes. I'll get her aboard the craft, and my wife, who is a stunnin' woman to work, 'll soon bring her to her senses."</p> 
               <p>"She will not die! Tell me again that her sweet life is not gone?"</p> 
               <p>"I tell ye she's only smothered i' the water she's swallered. Thar! hold her up a bit, and by the time we git to Betsy Ann, she'll be all right."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph lifted the drooping form, wrung out the wet locks of hair, and put them back from her face. He saw that life was returning, for a faint motion of the chest was perceptible, and a gleam of color came into the pale face on which he so wildly gazed. By the time they gained the sehooner, Alina unclosed her eyes, and looked around her; with a shudder she again seemed to relapse into insensibility,<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6349-00000033"/> and lifting her in his arms, all his strength restored by the sight of De Vere standing there to receive her, Rudolph sprang over the low bulwark, and brushing past the captain, strode at once to the cabin, and placed his precious burden in the berth which Betsy Ann had already prepared for her. She was a rough but kind-looking woman, who spoke without ceremony.</p> 
               <p>"All of you git out of the way now, and leave me alone with the young gal. Bring her things in, Jake, that I may git some dry close for her; and you, Jem, make her a stiff toddy, for gittin' inter the water sich a day as this, aint the best thing for a body's health, ef the sun does shine so bright."</p> 
               <p>The orders were speedily obeyed, for Betsy Ann was mistress both of the craft and her captain. Rudolph retired with the others, though he would gladly have remained till Alina had sufficiently revived to know what was passing around her. Jem offered him a change of clothes, but this he declined, as his habits were too hardy to endanger his health by suffering his own to dry on him. He resumed his coat, and sat down in the sun to await the report from her he had saved at the risk of his own life. After a few moments' hesitation, De Vere approached him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"To your gallantry I am indebted for the preservation of the young lady entrusted to my care. Unluckily I cannot swim myself, or I should have made the effort to save her. Here is the reward I offered for her rescue. It will help you on in your new career, and you have nobly won it."</p> 
               <p>At first Rudolph scarcely understood him, for his senses were yet confused, and he looked up in surprise; but the sight of money offered him for the rescue of Alina Derval fired every drop of blood in his body. He started up, confronted the officer, and sternly said:</p> 
                
               <p>"This is the second time to-day that you have insulted me by the offer of money for services which have been freely rendered. If you were a gentleman by nature, as you are one by birth, this would never have happened. Do you suppose that I risked my life for your paltry gold? or that I would accept a reward from <emph>you</emph> for saving one who--"</p> 
               <p>His voice here faltered, and De Vere coolly put up the money, while he looked fixedly at him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"One whom you have the presumption to love; but remember what I now say to you, and act on it. As well may you look with longing on the brightest star in the sky above us, and hope to lure it down to earth, as to win the daughter of two noble races to become the bride of a lowborn American woodman. The young lady has amused herself at your expense, but the future will prove to you how little sincerity there is in her professions of regard."</p> 
               <p>He turned on his heel, and sprang on shore. The first impulse of Rudolph's impetuous temper was to follow, and strike him; but respect for Alina withheld him from such a course. He again confronted De Vere with pale, compressed lip, and spoke to him with firm composure.</p> 
               <p>"You have bitterly insulted me, assuming that your superior position gives you the right to do so. The hour for a settlement has not arrived, but it will surely come, and then the free son of a free soil will return you defiance for defiance, blow for blow; and in that mortal combat, one or both shall perish."</p> 
               <p>"Be it so," replied the Englishman, with haughty emphasis. "Win your spurs, young man, that you may be worthy to cross steel with one who wears the uniform of the greatest nation on earth. When your rank equals my own, although it may have been gained in the cause of revolution, I will not balk your humor. I accept your challenge <foreign xml:lang="FRA"> l'ou-</foreign>
                  <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6349-00000034"/> 
                  <foreign xml:lang="FRA">trance,</foreign> and shall hold myself ready for the combat whenever the hour arrives."</p> 
               <p>"I shall hold you to your pledge," and Rudolph returned to his former seat as quietly as if this little interlude had not settled the preliminaries of a duel, which must end in the sacrifice of his own life, or in taking that of his adversary.</p> 
               <p>What De Vere had said of Alina touched him deeply, for he bitterly felt the uncertainty of the future with regard to her. She would be exposed to the flatteries of others; among them, those of this insolent Englishman, and his fiery soul chafed at the thought that she might smile on him, might give him her friendship, even if no warmer feeling mingled with her regard. Rudolph was aroused from his painful reverie by the voice of the captain's wife, who spoke close beside him:</p> 
               <p>"The young gal's better. She's come to herself, and is now sleepin' nicely. I give her a spoonful of toddy, but she didn't seem to relish it much, though 'twas made of real old Jamaky. I reckon it's 'bout time we was a gittin' off, for the sun's mountin' up, and we must be at Havre de Grace before three o'clock. Are you a gwine on, or do you go back?"</p> 
               <p>Rudolph looked up quickly.</p> 
               <p>"Then you will stop at Havre de Grace?"</p> 
               <p>"We allers does that; our trade's mostly from thar."</p> 
               <p>"Then I will bring my horses on board, and go that far with you. I wish to see the young lady again before I take a final leave of her."</p> 
               <p>"Well, that's f'ar, seein's how much you risked to git her out o' the bay. Onct I thought you was both gone to Davy Jones' locker. That's what we say, you know, when a body's drowned," she added, by way of explanation.</p> 
               <p>The captain here joined them, and when he understood Rudolph's intention to go on, he soon found a place on deck for his horses, which he regarded with an admiring eye. He said:</p> 
               <p>"These are jist the critters for cavalry-and they'll soon be in demand, I tell you. Sich a stirrin' up among the people, you've never seen since you was born. When I left Havre yistiddy, the whole town was alive, and sich a rakin' up of ole muskits, an' cleanin' o' rusty swords, ain't been seen in these diggins since the time o' the Injin wars."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph listened with intense interest.</p> 
               <p>"The people then are getting ready for the fight?"</p> 
               <p>"I reckin you'll think so, when you git thar. Ole Maryland ain't so far behind the Yankees. They're been the fust to bust up, and show the spunk o' the nation; but we'll not be fur behind 'em I reckon, and sich a lickin's as the red coats 'll git, will be a caution to 'em forever."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph arose, and impulsively grasped the hand of the speaker. He warmly said:</p> 
               <p>"Then you too espouse the cause of your country?"</p> 
               <p>"In course he does," responded Betsy Ann. "I'd like to see him take any other side, as long as my name's Mrs. Jake Jenkins; not but what he's willin' enough to do the right thing hisself."</p> 
               <p>"You may well say that, Mrs. Betsy Ann," said the skipper, with an accent of satisfaction. "But the day's gittin' on, and it's time we was startin.'"</p> 
               <p>The vessel was soon under way, and De Vere, after inquiring after Miss Derval, wrapped himself in his cloak and threw himself upon a bench; he was soon absorbed in a book which he drew from his pocket, and after one disdainful glance at the new passenger, he took no further notice of what was passing around him. He felt sure of his power to remove Alina, and beyond that, he cared nothing<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6349-00000035"/> ing for the bold backwoodsman who had so proudly defied him. His lip curled in scorn as he recalled his words, but it would have blanched to the hue of marble, if he could have looked into the future, and beheld the tragedy concealed behind its friendly vail; for these three lives, so casually thrown together, were to exercise an influence on each other most terrible in its results.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph sat watching the rippling waters, trying to bear with patience the long hours that elapsed before Alina awoke from the sleep into which she had fallen. Mrs. Jenkins had promised to inform her of his presence on the schooner, and his desire for a parting interview. At length the good-humored face of the skipper's wife appeared above the companion-way, and she beckoned the young man to approach. As he did so, she stepped down the narrow stairway and by a gesture invited him to follow her. This he promptly did, and when he stood beside her she said:</p> 
               <p>"The young gal's ready to see you now. She seemed right glad to hear that you hadn't gone off before she'd a chance to thank you. I'll wait here, while you go in and talk a spell wi' her."</p> 
               <p>Briefly thanking her, with some trepidation Rudolph unclosed the door and entered the narrow cabin. Alina, wrapped in a large shawl, was leaning against a pile of pillows, and her long hair was coiled around her head in loose bands held together by a knot of black ribbon. She was extremely pale, and in her eyes was an expression of vague terror that haunted Rudolph through many years of his after life. She held out her hand, and softly said:</p> 
               <p>"To you I owe my life; thanks for affording me an opportunity to express my gratitude before we part for an indefinite time, perhaps forever."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Forever!</emph>" he repeated in terror. "What can you mean, Alina? Have I not won the <emph>right</emph> to claim you as my own?"</p> 
                
               <p>She withdrew her hand from his clasp, passed it over her eyes, and with effort said:</p> 
               <p>"I fell asleep in that sweet belief; but oh, Michael, in those hours in which life was struggling back to my heart, I had a fearful dream, which was surely sent to me as a warning."</p> 
               <p>Her voice faltered, her lips trembled, and her emotion communicated itself to the listener, though he proudly said:</p> 
               <p>"I have no faith in the supernatural. I <emph>will</emph> have none in what may tend to sever me from you. I have your promise, and I shall claim its fulfilment. Tell me then, what was the nature of this dream that affects you thus."</p> 
               <p>"A dream-yes-but it seemed a fearful reality," she whispered with a shudder. "My mother stood beside me, stern and sorrowful, and she spoke these words distinctly:-'My child, go upon your path unshackled. Be not the curse upon the life of a noble and true man; save yourself from the sorrow that never dies; the anguish of remorse born of blood guiltiness.' Her face was so sorrowful, yet so terrible in its expression, her voice rang so startlingly in my ears, that I awoke with the impression that she was really beside me. Oh, Michael, our love can bring us nothing but sorrow-let us end our brief romance, and forget the vows we have exchanged. We shall suffer, but we are too young to despair; time and change will bring to us peace and forgetfulness."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph listened with dilating eyes and compressed lips; he took both her hands in his, and solemnly said:</p> 
               <p>"Answer me as if in the presence of the All Father, Alina. Do you seek to evade the vows we have plighted, from an unwillingness in your own heart to keep them? If so, speak the truth, and you are free forever. My heart may break, but it will never sue for love that is not fully and freely given."</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6349-00000036"/> 
               <p>"I do love you," she faintly said, "but fate is against us. I shall be fatal to you; let me go-let me go!"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Alina! can you know what love is, and yet speak thus?" he despairingly asked. "To hope for you as my reward is the beacon light of my existence; to win you I can do all, dare all. Take this from me, and I shall be nothing-nothing. Put this fantasy from you, for it was but a dream, and should have no power to sway you in so important a decision as the one which rests with you now. Speak! my fate is in your hands."</p> 
               <p>His deep excitement, the pallor of his face, the burning fire in his eyes, alarmed Alina, and she feared to utter ail she had intended saying. Her voice was tremulous, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"Such love as this is worth a life's devotion. The memory of my mother's solemn words shall be cast into oblivion. I recall my prayer for freedom from the tie that exists between us."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph threw himself upon his knees beside her-he pressed her cold hands to his burning lips and heart, while he poured forth a torrent of such passionate thanks and blessings as moved all that was true and womanly in her nature.</p> 
               <p>A tap upon the door interrupted him, and the voice of Mrs. Jenkins informed him that Havre de Grace was in sight, and in a few more moments the schooner would be at the wharf, where she would remain only long enough to receive a package of letters for a commercial house in Baltimore.</p> 
               <p>"Go!" said Alina, "be my hero; conquer the difficulties before you, and I will be yours."</p> 
               <p>"From this day I begin my career, never to rest till my reward is won," replied Rudolph, with animation. "I will seek service in a corps which may take me whither you are going. We shall meet under more favorable auspices, and in the meantime, hope and action shall be my watchwords."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Jenkins, impatient at his delay, unceremoniously unclosed the door, and entered the cabin.</p> 
               <p>"I should think you've had time enough to be thanked a hundred times, Mister; an' the schooner is runnin' in with a rush that'll bring her alongside the wharf in two more minutes. You'd better be seein' after your hosses, ef you don't mean to keep my man waitin' on you."</p> 
               <p>A look of deep and tender meaning was exchanged between the lovers, and Rudolph passed from the presence of Alina Derval to seek the turmoil of battle; to gain, while yet a youth, the laurel of fame, and a position won in honorable and gallant strife for the noble cause of freedom. She to pass beneath the influence of a subtle and artificial woman, who finished what nature had begun, by making her as worldly as herself, and far more unscrupulous.</p> 
               <p>Alina again fell into a feverish slumber, and her broken dream was renewed. The sorrowful face of her mother again appeared before her, and her voice seemed to wail forth: "Too late-too late! Lost! lost! lost!"</p> 
               <p>She awoke in a fright, and pondered on the double warning which forbade her future union with her betrothed. At length, weary of thought, she resolved to let circumstances take their own course, and be guided by them as they arose.</p> 
               <p>On the following evening she reached Baltimore in safety, and was at once transferred to the protection of Major Stanmore and his wife, who only awaited her arrival to embark for Norfolk. After making some necessary additions to her wardrobe, Alina was ready to accompany them, and no time was lost in setting out.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE YOUNG SOLDIER.</head> 
               <p>ON landing in the small town of Havre de Grace, the first thing that greeted Rudolph was the sound of a fife playing a march to which a drum beat an accompaniment. A band of rough but resolute-looking men was drawn up on the common in front of the village, receiving their first lesson in military training from a tall, finely-formed man in the prime of life, who wore the uniform of a militia colonel, with a crimson sash tied around his waist, in which was thrust a pair of highly ornamented pistols.</p> 
               <p>His broad brow, firm mouth, and piercing eyes, showed that he possessed many of the qualities necessary to a successful leader, and the clear, decided manner in which his commands were uttered, showed that he was accustomed to rule others.</p> 
               <p>Among the few books owned by Mr. Rudolph was a work on military tactics, which Michael had studied from boyhood, and he looked on intelligently as the drill proceeded. The eagle glance of the officer soon fell upon him, and he saw that here was one superior to the common herd, who might be made useful in the future. When his task was ended, he drew near the youth, and spoke in a friendly tone:</p> 
               <p>"You appear to comprehend something of military affairs, my young friend. I trust that you have been drawn hither by a desire to enter the service of your native land? Am I not right?"</p> 
               <p>Rudolph flushed, as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"It is my intention to do so as soon as possible, but today I came hither on a different errand. It is my purpose to join my countrymen in arms as soon as I can arrange my affairs at home."</p> 
               <p>"That is right; we need every patriot now to strike for the good cause. I am helping to drill these men, but I shall not command them. I have a troop of cavalry half formed, which I hope is destined to perform great deeds. You have a pair of noble horses there, and could mount yourself so splendidly that I would advise you to join them. I believe you are a son of Rudolph of the Glen? Your father's good repute is well known to me, and it is a guarantee for the future of his son."</p> 
               <p>Deeply gratified by this tribute to his good father, Rudolph replied:</p> 
               <p>"Nothing could suit me better than to serve under so experienced a commander as Colonel Calvert. You have seen service in Canada, sir, and you comprehend the work that is before us."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, youngster, and mean to do it with right good will, too," was the animated reply. "There must be no laggards in my troop; ready to move at all hours, and at all hazards, must he be who takes service under me. With this understanding, you will join me with the certainty that the most rigid discipline will prevail among my troopers. I desire to command a corps of picked men, and I promise them brilliant service."</p> 
               <p>"And I, sir, ask no better opening than this. I will join you to-morrow, and formally enrol myself in your troop."</p> 
               <p>"Why not to-day, my young friend? When a good work is to be done, never put it off till another day."</p> 
               <p>"You are right, Colonel. I will join you at once, for I already have the permission of my parents to join the forces that are rising in defence of our rights. But I must return to the Glen to bid them farewell before setting out on my campaign."</p> 
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6349-00000038"/> 
               <p>"That is but right; enrol your name, and pledge yourself to present yourself here three days hence, and you are free to make your parting visit to the old people. A good son will be apt to make a good soldier."</p> 
               <p>"I trust you will have no cause to complain of me when I have once learned my duty," replied Rudolph, with the straightforward simplicity that characterized him. "A man can but do his best, and I pledge myself to do that."</p> 
               <p>"And I, on my part, pledge myself to be a good and careful leader to those who trust themselves to my control. Come with me to my room at the tavern, where we can have a few moments' uninterrupted conversation."</p> 
               <p>Flattered by this invitation from a man of Colonel Calvert's standing, Rudolph accepted it, and leaving his horses in charge of a boy, he followed him to an old-fashioned house with a sign-board swinging in front, bearing upon its face the likeness of George III., destined, before many months rolled away, to be changed, by a few dexterous strokes of the brush, into that of a revolutionary general.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Calvert strode on to his own apartment, replying briefly yet politely to the crowd that filled the public room, and finally succeeded in closing the door on a few of the more pertinacious who followed him even to its threshold, in the hope of engaging him in a discussion of the stirring events of the hour.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Leonard Calvert was a descendant of one of the old Catholic families that first settled in Maryland. He was a man of varied experience, much judgment, and a firmness of purpose that never wavered when once his course of action was decided on. He had watched the course of the English government for the past twelve years, and with prescient eye had foreboded the storm that was now ready to burst. Slowly and reluctantly he made up his mind to the necessity of resisting the colonial policy of the mother country, but he had long held himself in readiness to take up arms at the first sound of the tocsin. In his youth, he had served a campaign in Canada, and now, his long-disused military skill was promptly called into requisition in the service of his country. He was raising, at his own expense, a squadron of cavalry for the present defence of Maryland, but he intended in the future to place it at the disposal of the commander-in-chief, when a necessity for its services arose elsewhere.</p> 
               <p>All this he briefly and clearly explained to Rudolph, and then, fixing his piercing glance upon the face of the youth, he asked:</p> 
               <p>"And now, understanding my intentions, are you ready to take service with me in the capacity of a common soldier? You have intelligence, and must rise, but your first essay must be among the rank and file."</p> 
               <p>"I have no right to aspire to a higher position now, for I have everything to learn," replied Rudolph, with simplicity. "I cannot expect to be entrusted with a command till I have learned how to obey."</p> 
               <p>"Right, my young friend," was the cordial response. "You are of the true metal, and I see in you the making of a fine soldier."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my colonel, I will endeavor to justify your good opinion. I shall enlist for the war, and never leave my flag till peace is proclaimed."</p> 
               <p>Calvert grasped his hand warmly as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"With such a spirit animating the young men of the land, our cause is safe. Forced to take up arms, we will never lay them down till our independence is secured, and may the God of battles be with us."</p> 
               <p>"Amen," responded Rudolph, and he took up the pen that lay on the table before them and in a bold hand inscribed his name upon the roll. While he was thus<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6349-00000039"/> employed, the door which opened into the adjoining room was cautiously unclosed, and the head of a young girl appeared. At a sign from Calvert she came in and stood beside him. She was not more than fourteen years of age, but her figure was tall and well-proportioned, and her brilliant black eyes, her raven hair, that hung in short curls around her graceful head, and the vivid animation of her features, rendered her appearance unusually attractive.</p> 
               <p>When Rudolph finished writing, he looked up, and bowed in a natural and graceful manner to the young lady.</p> 
               <p>"My daughter-Miss Calvert," said the colonel, "and this young gentleman, Dora, is one of whom you will approve, for he is about to join my troop. My daughter, young as she is, is a determined patriot, Mr. Rudolph."</p> 
               <p>Dora put out her hand with an expression of eager delight and impulsively said:</p> 
               <p>"Let me shake hands with you, Mr. Rudolph, and tell you that I like your spirit. Oh! if I were only a boy, I would follow my father to the war, and be his page, as the custom was in the days of chivalry. I have read all about those times, and I have often wished that I had lived then, that I might have been the fair lady of some gallant knighterrant. It would have been grand to place my colors on his breast, and bid him God speed upon his way."</p> 
               <p>Colonel Calvert laughed at the enthusiasm of his daughter.</p> 
               <p>"We live in different and better times, my child. Now, men struggle for equal rights, and not for some fantastic ideal of honor. The iron armor of the feudal ages has been exchanged for iron will and firmness of purpose that will not be baffled in its aim. But my young friend here will win his spurs all the same, and when they are gained, you may play the part suited to your fancy, by placing the laurel crown upon his brow."</p> 
                
               <p>"And from fairer hands no knight could wish to receive it," said Rudolph, with a deepening flush upon his cheek. "To fight in a noble cause, and win the smiles of beauty, is guerdon enough for the noblest cavalier."</p> 
               <p>Dora was evidently surprised at his tact, and graceful command of language, for nature had bestowed on him a facility of expression for which he was little indebted to the limited education he had received. She replied, with a gay smile:</p> 
               <p>"The commands of my father are always literally obeyed by me, and when the hour of triumph arrives, I will not forget my misson."</p> 
               <p>She bowed, exchanged a few words in a low tone with her father, and glided back the way she had come. Calvert sighed as he said:</p> 
               <p>"Dora is my all. She is spoiled and wayward at times, but she is the most affectionate of daughters. My only regret in this turmoil is, that I must be parted from her. And now that our business is ended, Mr. Rudolph, let us take some refreshment, for I must return to Calvert Hall before nightfall."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph declined this invitation, and parted from him with a promise to return at the appointed time. He had twenty miles to ride before reaching home, and he could well imagine the uneasiness his long absence had already occasioned in the Glen. After taking a hurried lunch, he set out on his return, riding at times with furious haste, and then slackening his pace almost to a walk, as his mind turned toward the adored one from whom he had that day parted, till jealousy and doubt again drove him onward in the mad pace of excitement.</p> 
               <p>It was after nightfall when he drew up at his father's gate, where he found the whole family watching for his arrival, and the voice of his brother hailed him at once.</p> 
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6349-00000040"/> 
               <p>"Is that you, Michael? Ah, old fellow, we began to think that you had run off to enlist at once, and our mother has been in a pretty stew about you."</p> 
               <p>"I was afraid she'd be uneasy; but you're not far wide of the mark, Rupert, for I returned here to tell you all that I have become a soldier laddie."</p> 
               <p>His brother laughed.</p> 
               <p>"You are in a hurry to begin the career that is to make you a great man. I say, Michael, when you are a prince, I hope you will make me at least a baron; but what <emph>have</emph> you been doing to-day?"</p> 
               <p>By this time they had reached the door, in which Mr. and Mrs. Rudolph stood waiting them.</p> 
               <p>"I have enlisted in a cavalry troop which Calvert of the Hall is raising, and I join my company day after to-morrow. Was I not right, father, to seize the opportunity to serve under so true a man and so tried a soldier?"</p> 
               <p>"Right-of course, lad; who will question your judgment in making so fine a beginning. Colonel Calvert is a noble man, and a gallant officer. With him, I shall feel that you are in the right way to distinction. Come in to supper, my boy, and tell us all the particulars. Your mother has been worrying about you all the afternoon, and wondering what detained you so long."</p> 
               <p>"You are safe, and I am contented," said Mrs. Rudolph; "but you must be tired and hungry, my son. Come in and take supper before telling us of your adventures."</p> 
               <p>Michael did not need pressing, for the keen air and his rapid ride had given him a good appetite, and after partaking of the abundant fare set before him, he related all the occurrences of the day, save his defiance of De Vere, and the interview between himself and Alina. Neither did he tell them how near he had come to losing his own life in his attempt to save her, though his mother grew pale and trembled as he described his plunge into the bay.</p> 
               <p>"Where was Captain De Vere, that he left you to rescue Alina?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, he was busy taking care of himself, and shouting out that he would pay any one that would do what he couldn't do himself," was the bitter reply.</p> 
               <p>His father looked at him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"And he offered you money again? Was it so, lad?"</p> 
               <p>"It was, sir; but he knows better than to attempt it again," was the significant reply. "As long as he lives, Captain De Vere will remember what I said to him to-day. How noble a contrast is Colonel Calvert to this proud Englishman-one is the aristocrat of nature, the other, of chance."</p> 
               <p>"Come, tell us all about him, lad. I knew Calvert of the Hall many years ago, and a true gentleman he has always been."</p> 
               <p>"He remembered you, sir, and spoke of you so kindly that my heart warmed to him. His daughter came in while I was with him, and although she is yet a child, she seems as full of fire about the times as her father is."</p> 
               <p>"His daughter? she must be quite young. There was a son, who was a reckless youth, and deeply involved his father before his death. The mother was an heiress, but she was very eccentric, and spent large sums of money in every kind of extravagance while she lived. Now, the colonel is about to finish the old acres by getting up a company at his own expense. <emph>Your</emph> outfit shall cost him nothing, at any rate, my boy, for I can afford to send at least one soldier to defend the land in which I have gained a home."</p> 
               <p>"One soldier?" asked Rupert. "Is Michael to do all the fighting, when I am the elder? That is hardly just."</p> 
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6349-00000041"/> 
               <p>"One son must remain at home, unless the demand for men becomes so stringent as to call every true patriot to take up arms. The land must be tilled, that our soldiers may be fed, and you can do as good service on the farm as in the battle-field."</p> 
               <p>"I submit to your superior judgment, father, but while following the plough, I shall listen for the bugle call, and when I think it time to go, I too, must shoulder my knapsack."</p> 
               <p>"So let it be, my son. If your services become necessary I will endeavor to do without you, but it would be too hard on your mother to ask her to give up both her children at once."</p> 
               <p>A tear stole down Mrs. Rudolph's cheek, but she firmly said:</p> 
               <p>"I can give them both to their country if need be. In this hour it is the duty of every man to sustain the cause of freedom, and my sons shall not be laggards in the strife. Rupert shall go or stay as seems best to him, and I will pray that the shield of a just cause be over both my precious ones."</p> 
               <p>Thus it was finally settled, and throughout the following day such preparations were made for the departure of the youngest born as would, as far as possible, assure his well-being. The finest horse in the stable was selected for his use, and Mr. Rudolph brought from some secret receptacle several hundred dollars in gold, which he had hoarded from his yearly savings. A sufficient number of these were bestowed on Michael to enable him to purchase the outfit necessary to a trooper, and to start in his new career without becoming a source of expense to his commander.</p> 
               <p>Throughout that last day the youth lingered near his mother as much as was consistent with his more active duties. Through the pale calmness of her face he saw the tender heart struggling with the heroism which dictated the sacrifice she was ready to make for the sake of honor and patriotism; and he loved and reverenced her more deeply than ever.</p> 
               <p>In the evening they went together into the little room lately occupied by Alina, and there she gave him her last tender counsels. Toward the close of the interview, she said:</p> 
               <p>"Before you go forth to mingle in the turmoil of the world, Michael, I must warn you of a portion of the astrologer's prediction which has not hitherto been spoken of. Events seem to tend to a fufilment of a portion of them, then why not of all."</p> 
               <p>She paused, and Rudolph impatiently asked:</p> 
               <p>"What then has been withheld, and why have you not before told me the whole?"</p> 
               <p>"Because my judgment told me that it was not well to cloud your youth with presages of sadness. Success in arms, but failure in love, was predicted. Domestic calamities, fatal to your peace, were foretold connected with one you would madly love. Fatal events were to spring from your <emph>first</emph> passion; but your <emph>second</emph> one would bring you a brilliant marriage, and the love of a true and noble woman."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph laughed scornfully:</p> 
               <p>"I repudiate all the nonsense the old dotard wrote. A <emph>second</emph> passion for me! There is no room in my heart for any but Alina, and I will wed her or none. Second love for me-for <emph>me,</emph> whose every hope in life is set upon this single cast! Mother, forbear; utter not such dishonor to your son, as faithlessness to her to whom he is bound by every tie of truth and affection. Alina, the bright star of promise, declared the cause of bitter suffering and humiliation to me. Never, never! I love her, I have faith in her, and<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6349-00000042"/> I refuse to believe in the idle words uttered over my cradle. Put them from you I charge you as you love me, for they are a great wrong to her who will become my wife."</p> 
               <p>With heaving breast, clenched hands, and flashing eyes, these rapid words were uttered, and Mrs. Rudolph listened in appalled silence. There was a pause, during which Michael struggled to gain the mastery of himself; at length he spoke, in a calmer tone:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon my violence, mother, for I see that it has moved you deeply; but this idle prophecy has taken too deep a hold on your imagination. I have youth, strength, courage-and they shall win my way. The blessing of my life shall not be turned into a curse, by the demented croakings of an old madman. But what is to be the <emph>end,</emph> mother? He told you that too, I suppose, as soothsayers seldom leave their work unfinished until the grave is gained."</p> 
               <p>"No," replied Mrs. Rudolph, in a low, pained tone; "he did not complete his work. He placed you on the pinnacle of fame and prosperity, and wrote these words: 'The Life Curse will work her spells with fatal power through many years of his life; but while the web of fate is weaving, he shall win all that man can ask. The end let no man reveal, for God will develop all in His own good time.'"</p> 
               <p>Rudolph laughed bitterly:</p> 
               <p>"Truly the end is worthy of the beginning. My joy, my hope, my inspiration is then to become the curse of my life! Oh, stupid and lying prophecy! I cast ye to the winds! I will prove ye false as the heart that imagined such a future for an innocent babe! Mother, where is that paper? let me burn it, and forget all it pretends to reveal; for I swear to reverse all its predictions so far as Alina is concerned in them!"</p> 
               <p>"I trust that you may be able to do so, Michael. Here is the chart; I brought it here to show it to you before you leave your home, and take on yourself the responsibilities of manhood."</p> 
               <p>She drew from her pocket a sheet of paper, yellowed by time, and worn at the edges where it was folded. Rudolph opened it, and scanned the page of strange hieroglyphics that met his gaze; they would have been utterly unintelligible but for sentences in writing that at intervals partially explained their meaning. From these his family had gleaned the high destiny foretold for him with its accompanying drawbacks. An eagle symbolized himself, and throughout he was followed by a falcon, that struck at intervals upon his breast, and buried her talons deep within it. The last had written above it in several places: "The dark Shadow," "The Fate," "The Life Curse."</p> 
               <p>An expression of intense and bitter scorn crept over Rudolph's face as he glanced over the record which had been so long and so carefully preserved. He contemptuously twisted it together, and holding it above the flame of the candle, said:</p> 
               <p>"Thus perish the idle dreaming of an unsound mind! Phnix-like, my fate shall arise from its ashes, purified from the foul dregs of evil and wrong which the astrologer dared to mix up with it. Do not mourn over its destruction, mother, for I will weave for myself a better future than was there foretold."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph watched the curling flames with regret, for she had dwelt upon those mystic pages many hours in her life, and pondered on the strange predictions it contained with a growing faith in their eventual realization; but she made no effort to stay his hand. The paper concerned Rudolph alone, and he possessed the right to destroy it, if it was his will to do so; and, after all, it might be folly to believe in the improbable destiny it foreshadowed for the son of an American backwoodsman.</p> 
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6349-00000043"/> 
               <p>On the following morning, Rudolph bade a long farewell to his home, bearing with him the blessings and prayers of his mother. He set out for Havre de Grace mounted on his noble steed, and supplied with ample means to provide for his wants for several months to come; with buoyant heart he started forth on that career, which, in time to come, was to make him known as "bravest of the brave" among men of world-wide fame.</p> 
               <p>His father and brother accompanied him to Havre de Grace, where they found Col. Calvert busily engaged in enlisting recruits for the service he had undertaken. The young aspirant for military honors was cordially received by him, and the old father was gratified by the prediction of the tried soldier that his son would speedily win promotion by his gallantry and good conduct. The troop was already nearly filled, for the young men of the county eagerly sought to join the standard of one who would speedily lead them into active service. The most of them were fearless riders, accustomed to use the rifle with unerring skill, and Calvert confidently believed that a few weeks' training would suffice to render them efficient in the field.</p> 
               <p>At the moment of final parting, Mr. Rudolph placed his hand in solemn benediction upon his son's head, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Be a good and true man, Michael, and fight to the bitter end for the cause of freedom; and may the God of our Fathers be with you in the hour of peril, to protect and save you from all harm."</p> 
               <p>Did this prayer of a good man shield him amid the storm of bullets that so often rained around him in those days when he rode like Mars unscathed through the battlefield? It may be that it did, for throughout his brilliant career, he scarcely received a wound of importance.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">ALINA'S NEW HOME.</head> 
               <p>ALINA DERVAL soon recovered from the effects of her plunge in the bay, and under the supervision of Mrs. Stanmore, such additions were made to her wardrobe as would enable her to appear with proper credit in her new sphere. Deep mourning is not often becoming to its wearer, but her sable robes seemed to give additional brilliancy to the delicate fairness of her complexion, and her ruby lips, bright eyes, and magnificent hair, fairly entitled her to the epithet of "charming" which her new friends applied to her. Major Stanmore and his wife were well-bred English people, who sought by their kindness to remove the forlorn feeling which they felt her isolated position must inspire; and they made the young stranger speedily feel that she was no longer a waif thrown upon the world, without friends on whom she had a claim.</p> 
               <p>Alina knew very little of her uncle's domestic affairs, and she eagerly sought to gain from Mrs. Stanmore such information as would be useful to her in the new scene on which she was about to enter. She ascertained that his wife had been dead for many years; and his only child, a daughter about ten years of age, was under the charge of an accomplished French lady, who also superintended the domestic affairs of Col. Fitzhugh's family.</p> 
               <p>"In fact," said Mrs. Stanmore, "Madame Girand is virtually mistress of his house, and I fancy that she will, in due time, be installed in the place of your deceased aunt. She is still a very handsome woman, and is exceedingly attractive in society; she speaks English perfectly, and is a brilliant musician. You will be fortunate, my dear, in having<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6349-00000044"/> so elegant a person to train your natural grace, for the triumphs your beauty will be sure to win."</p> 
               <p>Alina smiled brightly at this compliment, but she demurely said:</p> 
               <p>"I have not been thought beautiful, madame. My father has often lamented that I was so little like my mother in that respect; and they both impressed on me that if I succeed in society, it must be through my wit, and not my personal charms."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that was well enough in your childhood, because it kept you from becoming vain; but you will develop into a splendid woman; though not regularly beautiful, you are piquant, graceful and interesting. Madame Girand will know how to bring out all your latent charms, and teach you how to make the best use of them."</p> 
               <p>"Then my uncle seems to have made a fortunate selection of a governess for my cousin and myself. Do you know much of Helen? Is she spoiled, or is she a pattern child?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I believe Helen is a little of both. Her father spoils her, and Madame tries to make her what, in my opinion, no child should be made, a miniature woman. Luckily one counteracts the other, and your cousin will probably develop into what nature designed her to be, a good and lovely woman."</p> 
               <p>"And this lady, who may become Col. Fitzhugh's wife, who is she? and how has she been reduced to the necessity of taking charge of my uncle's family for a support."</p> 
               <p>"Madame Girand is the widow of a French officer, and a woman of good family herself. That is all I know of her history. I have warned you of probabilities, that you may understand at once the course it will be best to pursue. Girls of your age are often inclined to be headstrong, but I would advise you to pursue a different line of policy, for Col. Fitzhugh will put down rebellion with a strong hand, and Madame Girand possesses his entire confidence."</p> 
               <p>Alina calmly replied:</p> 
               <p>"I think I see my way clearly in the new life before me. I thank you for your judicious cautions, and I shall be sure to be guided by them. Madame Girand will not find me an intractable pupil, for I desire to profit by her instructions as far as possible, as it is my wish to become a brilliant woman of society."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better, my dear. This lively French-woman will soon initiate so apt a pupil into all the fascinations she knows how to practice so well herself. Only show her that you are docile, and you will be mutually charmed with each other."</p> 
               <p>After a pause, Alina asked:</p> 
               <p>"Is Captain De Vere also a member of my uncle's family?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he forms a part of his military household. There are several other young officers attached to his corps, who eat at his table. You will find no lack of admirers in your new sphere, but you must not let these gay young men turn your head by their flatteries. In good time your uncle will find a suitable match for you; but you are much too young to think of marriage for several years yet."</p> 
               <p>Alina blushed slightly, and her thoughts flew back to the passionate scenes though which she had lately passed. She sunk into a reverie, and pondered on the uncertain chances in favor of the ultimate realization of her lover's hopes. Already she dreamed of new conquests, vainly laying the "flattering unction to her soul" that admiration from others would not of necessity impair her fidelity to him. Her heart was guarded, and her actions Rudolph would not be near to criticize or condemn. Then why should she not grasp the glittering baubles of excitement and pleasure as<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6349-00000045"/> they arose upon her path, and leave the future to take care of itself? Her fate had now passed beneath the control of others, and she would not hold herself responsible for the turn affairs might henceforth take.</p> 
               <p>De Vere was greatly struck by the improvement made in her appearance by her new and fashionable attire, and he soon began to feel that in herself she was deserving of the attentions he had resolved to bestow upon her as a means of rivalling the rustic bore who had so deeply piqued him. He had no intention of falling in love with her, for it did not suit his views to marry a dependent and penniless girl; but he fully intended to show her the wide difference between a dashing officer of the royal army and the unpolished son of a colonial farmer. He would play the part of the lover, without coming to the point of asking her hand, and his vanity flattered him that the rivalry he meditated would not be very difficult to accomplish.</p> 
               <p>In the daily intercourse into which they must be thrown, he would have opportunities to commend himself to her favor, of which he intended fully to avail himself; though he merely designed to detach Alina's thoughts from her first lover, and show her how much higher her ambition might soar in the future that lay before her. He rightly judged that she was not one to sigh long over a dream of broken love, and she who had proved faithless to one adorer could, in her turn, find a solace for his own ultimate defection in the conquests she would be sure to win.</p> 
               <p>But after events proved to De Vere that it is not often safe to play with edged tools, even if they are wielded by the hand of a master. Alina was by nature a consummate coquette, and she at once comprehended and foiled the part he intended to play towards her. She alternately piqued and flattered him till it became a question with him whether this untutored country girl would condescend to share the future grandeur of the heir to a baronetcy, sustained by a large inheritance.</p> 
               <p>In the flirtation that ensued, both players were equally skilled in finesse, and with bitter pique, the young man felt that his fair antagonist was quite a match for himself in the dangerous game they were playing; and try as he would, he could not even gain the assurance that she had relinquished all thoughts of the country bumpkin, as he contemptuously styled Rudolph.</p> 
               <p>But this culminating point was the growth of time, and in the interim Alina progressed in her knowledge of the world, and made good use of the lessons she received from her competent instructress in the art of pleasing.</p> 
               <p>The party embarked for Norfolk, and after a tedious voyage, interrupted by a severe gale which at one time threatened the vessel with shipwreck, they reached their harbor in safety.</p> 
               <p>Lord Dunmore was still in authority as royal governor of Virginia, and Col. Fitzhugh was in command of one of the forts which controlled the entrance to the river on which the town of Norfolk is built. The fort consisted of earthen walls, mounted with cannon, which surrounded an esplanade in which stood the houses of the officers and the quarters of the soldiers.</p> 
               <p>Virginia had not yet assumed a hostile attitude toward the mother country, though Lord Dunmore, by his intemperate measures, was doing all in his power to arouse the resistance of the people. Until very recently, Col. Fitzhugh had occupied a house in the town, but the mutterings of the approaching tempest warned him that it would be safest to remove his family to the fort, where they would be safe in case of an outbreak among the people; though they still maintained social relations with those who had hitherto found his house a pleasant place of resort.</p> 
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6349-00000046"/> 
               <p>Fort Norfolk stands upon a tongue of land separated from the town by a narrow stream, over which a draw-bridge was thrown that could be raised in case of an attack from that side; and it was protected in the rear by a morass over which artillery could not be drawn. Several ships of war were lying in the stream, prepared to hurl their iron missiles on the town if any attempt were made by the inhabitants to throw off the authority of the British crown.</p> 
               <p>The transport in which Major Stanmore and his little party had embarked passed under the frowning cannon that projected from their port-holes, ready at a moment's warning to launch destruction on the city. A few months later, the tyrannical governor and his suit were compelled to take refuge on these ships, to shelter themselves from the rage of an outraged and indignant people.</p> 
               <p>The transport fired a gun as a salute and run up the cross of St. George, which was responded to by a gun from each ship; she then rounded to beneath the walls of the fort, for the purpose of landing the passengers and stores she had brought.</p> 
               <p>A tall, stately-looking man, with a spy-glass in his hand, stood upon the parapet watching the motions of the approaching craft. His face was strongly marked, and his mouth and lower jaw firm as iron; both his hair and eyebrows were already gray, though he had scarcely reached middle age. A handkerchief was waved to him from the deck of the vessel by Mr. Stanmore, to which he gallantly responded by a flourish of the glass he held in his hand, and, leaving his post, he descended to greet his newly arrived friends. With firm tread and eagle glance, Col. Fitzhugh approached the group collected near the gangway, and as De Vere advanced to meet him, he rapidly said:</p> 
               <p>"You have accomplished your errand, I trust, and have brought my niece with you."</p> 
                
               <p>"There she stands beside Mrs. Stanmore."</p> 
               <p>"What! that young lady my little Alina! truly, three years have marvellously changed her."</p> 
               <p>Making a rapid and graceful salute to Mrs. Stanmore, he passed on, and taking Alina in his arms, said with emotion:</p> 
               <p>"Welcome, my child, to your uncle's heart and home. As soon as I heard of your bereavement I took measures to take you under my own protection, and now, thank heaven! you are safe beneath my care. Regard me as a father, Alina, for such it is my purpose to be to you."</p> 
               <p>Alina thanked him sweetly, and as she glanced in his bronzed face, she thought that, after all, her uncle was not so formidable a personage as her imagination had painted him. In a few more moments they were walking arm in arm up the bank, followed by the rest of the party.</p> 
               <p>Major Stanmore and his wife stopped at their own quarters, and Colonel Fitzhugh and his niece passed on to the upper end of the esplanade, where stood a commodious house, with a colonnade in front, supported by massive pillars. This was the residence of the commandant, and in the doorway stood a lady and child ready to welcome the young stranger.</p> 
               <p>Madame Girand came forward with much <foreign xml:lang="FRA">empressement,</foreign> and taking Alina's hand, imprinted a kiss upon her brow. In a sweet-toned voice she said:</p> 
               <p>"We have looked forward to your arrival with much pleasure, Mademoiselle. My sweet Helen has also been most impatient to welcome you."</p> 
               <p>Helen, a dark, gipsy-looking child, with eyes of flashing brightness, and an expression of premature intelligence, shyly put out her little brown hand.</p> 
               <p>"You are to be my new sister, papa says. I am glad you have come, for it is dull since we came to the fort to live."</p> 
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6349-00000047"/> 
               <p>"Poor child," said Madame Girand, "she misses her young associates sadly. We have only been in the garrison a few weeks, Miss Derval, and I must say that I, too, regret the interruption of our pleasant, social intercourse with the inhabitants of the town. However, we are not quite cut off from them yet, though I do not know how long we may be permitted to enjoy the pleasure of associating with them."</p> 
               <p>"As long as they remain loyal to their king, Madame, and not an instant longer," said Colonel Fitzhugh, with decision. "Let us enter the house, for my niece has had a rough voyage hither, and she will doubtless be glad to repose a few hours."</p> 
               <p>The few words Alina spoke in reply to the kindness lavished upon her, were graceful and well chosen, and the impression she made on her new friends was extremely pleasing. Madame Girand pronounced her charming, and Helen concluded that she should really like her, while Alina herself had as carefully scanned them, and with her natural acuteness, aided by Mrs. Stanmore's previous hints, she rapidly made up her mind as to her future relations towards them. She thought:</p> 
               <p>"I will flatter my uncle, and make him like me; with the Frenchwoman, I shall get on well enough; but Helen will be a nuisance to me that I must tolerate on account of her father's kindness. I wish she was a boy, for then she would not be so much in my way, nor be able to spy upon me, as she will do, I know."</p> 
               <p>Madame Girand ushered her into the comfortable apartment prepared for her, which opened into her own room, and after dismissing Helen, sat down beside the couch on which Alina threw herself, and talked with the graceful ease of a Frenchwoman desirous of producing a good impression. Alina watched her graceful movement, the expressive play of her mobile features, and she was not surprised that her uncle had been captivated by the bright intelligence which formed their chief charm.</p> 
               <p>Madame Girand was a woman of thirty-five, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">petite</foreign> in form, and full of fire and activity, with great command of language, and an intellect of unusual grasp, which had been carefully cultivated. She was fully imbued with all the dangerous philosophy of the era in which she had received her training, and was familiar with the literature of that epoch. She placed reason on the throne of religion, and contended with animation that the hour would arrive when man would prostrate himself before its divine majesty, and offer his homage at the only shrine worthy of his worship. In good time that hour did arrive to her countrymen, and the bloodiest record in the annals of crime was its legitimate result.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Fitzhugh, no very strict churchman himself, listened with an incredulous smile to her eloquent declamations, too much charmed by the grace of the speaker to scan their subversive tendency, and left her free to impress her ideas on the plastic minds entrusted to her guidance. He believed it to be of very little consequence what women thought, for he had the innate conviction that their sphere is only a domestic one, and the natural instincts of a pure woman would correct such erratic tendencies as would compromise her happiness.</p> 
               <p>It would be quite as safe to administer poison, because an antidote is at hand ready to counteract its effects; and one, at least, of these young souls was to illustrate the fatal effects of the lessons she too readily imbibed.</p> 
               <p>A strict bond of union soon grew up between the teacher and the pupil, and Madame Girand was enchanted to find Alina so capable of profiting by her instructions. She learned with facility, and her skill on the harp, and her<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6349-00000048"/> pure French accent soon equalled that of her preceptress, but the inward deterioration kept pace with the external improvement. She lost the guiding star of life, in surrendering the simple faith her mother had given her for this new found philosophy, and she who inculcated it would have been startled and shocked, could she have beheld the first fruits her training would, in time, produce.</p> 
               <p>The mode of life to which Alina was now introduced, was in striking contrast to that to which she had hitherto been accustomed. Her mornings were passed in study, to which she arduously devoted herself; but she appeared at dinner in the toilette of a young lady, and received the attentions of the officers with the graceful ease of one much more practised in society. The arrival of a gay and coquettish girl at the fort was soon known on board the ships in the harbor, and in a few weeks Alina Derval could have claimed nearly all their more youthful officers as captives to her subtle power to charm.</p> 
               <p>To her grave uncle, it was an amusement to see how she played them off against each other, though he warned her not to attach too much importance to the flatteries they whispered in her ears. She answered his caution in such a manner as convinced him that young as she was, she knew how to take care of herself as well as if the wisdom of age had been joined with the fresh charms of early youth.</p> 
               <p>Helen found that Alina was no companion for her, for all her time was occupied in her studies, or in society, and she soon ceased to exact any attention from her, though the little girl kept an observant eye upon her, and often made most mal-apropos reports of her cousin's flirtations.</p> 
               <p>As summer approached, the wide drawbridge became the theatre of these, for every evening the ladies from the garrison promenaded on their side, while those from the town came upon the opposite one, to listen to the well-trained bands on board of the ships, and to discuss the news of the day.</p> 
               <p>Occasionally the two parties mingled together, but soon the difference in political feeling caused each one to keep to its own side, and thus Alina Derval became the cynosure of attraction to the English officers who were now coldly received by the young ladies of the town. There, in the light moonlight, fanned by the soft summer air, she held her little court, and took especial pains to show De Vere that his attentions were of less importance to her than those of half-a-dozen others.</p> 
               <p>At times, he was enraged, and vowed within himself that he was perfectly indifferent to her; that so finished a coquette was unworthy of a thought; but still he did think about her more and more, until he ended by becoming the most infatuated of her adorers. One evening she had slighted him more than usual, and enraged at his own weakness, he moodily leaned over the railing of the bridge watching the current as it rippled by, and trying to make up his mind to think no more of this incomprehensible creature, whose Protean changes bewildered and fascinated him more deeply with every passing hour.</p> 
               <p>The various groups had dispersed; the naval officers had returned to their boats, and Alina lingered behind her uncle and Madame Girand for the purpose of affording the moody young man an opportunity to join her. As she passed him, she hummed a tender air which she knew was his favorite one, and unable to resist the flattery thus indirectly offered, De Vere turned and joined her. After a pause, he bitterly said:</p> 
               <p>"I fancy that young clodhopper, who risked his life to save yours not very long ago, would have been amazed and enraged, if he had seen you to-night in the midst of those idle young men, smiling on all-flirting with all alike."</p> 
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6349-00000049"/> 
               <p>Alina laughed mockingly:</p> 
               <p>"I do not know that he has any more right to be angry than you seem to imagine you possess. It is something new for you to espouse the cause of Rudolph, but you are mistaken if you think that I am bound to him because he saved me from drowning."</p> 
               <p>"Do you then mean to say that there was nothing between you? that he did not part from you without some hope for the future? Tell me the truth, Alina, for I must have it."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Must!</emph> that is rather imperative, and I do not acknowledge your right to fathom my affairs. But I will say this much in reply: it would be an idle and silly dream on my part, to fancy that fortune can ever place my young preserver in a position to claim my hand. He loves me, perhaps, better than any one else ever will, and in the moment of parting I was too weak to evade his passionate protestations as I <emph>now</emph> should. Let this explanation suffice."</p> 
               <p>"Then you have cast his pretensions to the winds! Eureka! that much is gained at least. This impertinent youngster has found his true level in your regard, and I-I may hope."</p> 
               <p>"Hope-for what?" asked Alina, with fire. "To gain a place in my heart, when your proud English relatives would spurn the thought of an alliance with a portionless and dependent girl! Nay, Captain De Vere, I am too proud for that."</p> 
               <p>"Your family is equal to my own, and my father is rich enough to dispense with fortune in the object of my choice. You are charming enough to excuse a man for any folly he may commit for your sake."</p> 
               <p>"So-you admit that it would be a folly. I quite agree with you; so pray let this discussion end. It can produce no good result to either of us."</p> 
                
               <p>De Vere walked by her side, endeavoring to stifle the wrath that mastered him. At length he said:</p> 
               <p>"I will not consider this decision as final; if you have a heart, which at times I doubt, I will find the means to touch it yet-to bend it to my will; for I swear that no woman shall baffle me as you have hitherto done. The fate that threw us together will yet work out its own purposes, for I feel assured that your future and my own are bound up together."</p> 
               <p>"If so, it will not be for good to either of us," replied Alina, with a slight tremor in her voice, which he was eager to interpret to his own advantage. "You would find upon your path one who will never submit to be rivaled by you. I am already warned of that."</p> 
               <p>"Then I was not wrong. Rudolph has gained some pledge from you which gave him the right to utter such a warning."</p> 
               <p>"Why speak of that childish folly? It is past, and in a measure forgotten. I think of Rudolph only as a friend. I am too young to dream seriously of love. I frankly own that I like to be admired, but the flattering speeches made to me I rate at their true value."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you are young in years, but old in craft and dissimulation," replied De Vere, bitterly. "Yet I, who fathom your nature thoroughly, cannot escape from the thrall in which you hold me. What power is it that enables you to bind me to you, and torture me at your will?"</p> 
               <p>Again Alina's mocking laugh rang out, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps my power springs from sympathy of nature. We are not unlike, Captain De Vere, and in the struggle between us, the strongest will must gain the mastery. Conquer me if you can; I throw down the gauntlet, and defy you to the contest."</p> 
               <p>"I accept the gage," he responded, almost fiercely, "and<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6349-00000050"/> I feel that I shall win. You will lead me a fearful dance, but the end shall be victory. As to the threats of my rival, I cast them to the winds. If he thinks an alienated heart worth fighting for, I will not balk him; in the seas of blood about to be shed, the life of one man can matter little in the account."</p> 
               <p>Alina shuddered and grew pale. She said:</p> 
               <p>"This is utter madness; I cannot become the cause of strife between you and one to whom I am so deeply indebted as to Rudolph. Let this matter drop; we are friends, and nothing more; too wide a gulf separates your fate and mine, to be bridged over by idle hopes that can never be realized. Good night, Captain De Vere; I shall forget all that has passed in this interview, and I advise you to do the same."</p> 
               <p>She smiled, kissed her hand lightly to him, and disappeared within the house, which by this time they had gained. De Vere turned moodily away, muttering:</p> 
               <p>"Forget! as if that were possible. No, my dainty queen, I will <emph>not</emph> forget-nor shall you escape me. Elude me as you will, double as you may on your tortuous path, the passion you have kindled in my heart shall yet meet its return. I <emph>will not</emph> be baffled in this pursuit, though it may be madness to follow it up. Madness! yes it is the hight of folly to pursue such an ignis fatuus; but this girl lures me on, then taunts me, slights me, yet winds me to her purpose with the skill of a demon, while wearing the smile of a seraph. She will not refuse to become Lady De Vere, and therein lies my strongest hold upon her."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE YOUNG MARPLOT.</head> 
               <p>WHILE the conversation with De Vere proceeded, Alina had not observed that Helen had also lingered behind the others, though she walked near enough to the two to have been noticed by them had they not been too deeply absorbed in their conversation to be aware of her presence. Helen heard every word they uttered, and although there was much she did not understand, she comprehended the general drift of the interview well enough for her purpose. In the family Helen was considered an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">enfant terrible,</foreign> for she was frankness itself, and she invariably revealed openly the secrets she discovered.</p> 
               <p>She looked very sagacious at the breakfast table, but she restrained herself till they had retired to the library, in which their studies were carried on. Colonel Fitzhugh usually spent a few moments with them before going out to attend to his more active duties, and the young marplot waited till this time to speak of the discovery she had made on the previous night. She placed her lips near her father's ear, and said in a loud whisper:</p> 
               <p>"Papa, do you know that my cousin has two lovers?"</p> 
               <p>"Only two, Helen? I thought that at least half the young officers who visit here belong to Alina by right of conquest."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes-they make fine speeches to her, but these are real lovers, for they are ready to fight each other for her sake."</p> 
               <p>"Fight for her! that would be serious indeed. Do you hear what charges this young eavesdropper is bringing against your adorers, Alina?"</p> 
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6349-00000051"/> 
               <p>Alina listened with deep annoyance-she flushed deeply as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"Helen has insatiable curiosity. She has overheard some nonsense, and misinterpreted it: that is all."</p> 
               <p>Helen fired up at this insinuation, and quickly responded:</p> 
               <p>"I know this much at least-you have a lover whose name is Rudolph, and he has threatened Captain De Vere's life if he rivals him with you. There-didn't I hear <emph>that</emph> last night from his own lips? See how you are blushing. Papa can see from your looks that I have told the truth."</p> 
               <p>Colonel Fitzhugh surveyed his niece with keen scrutiny, and he deliberately said:</p> 
               <p>"So-Helen has touched a real train of powder, sure enough, but the match is not yet lighted, and the explosion may be prevented. Rudolph? He is the son of the kind family that took you in when you most needed protection. I hope my little girl has not exerted her fascinations in that direction, for I would not have her branded with ingratitude toward those good people, and it is quite impossible for her to be anything to them in the future."</p> 
               <p>"Nor is such my own wish," replied Alina, in a low voice. "The person in question is almost a boy in years, so you see what nonsense all this is."</p> 
               <p>"But De Vere was jealous of him, that gives some color to his pretensions. You are too young to think seriously of marriage yet, but the captain is a man to whose attentions I should not object when the right time comes. Remember one thing, Alina; this young rebel is quite out of the question, even if he were your equal in other respects. I should never willingly receive into my family one who has taken up arms against the mother country."</p> 
               <p>"Have no fears on that score, sir," replied Alina, now looking clearly and tranquilly in his face. "I have no idea of accepting the vows of this young countryman. If you knew what a boy he is, you would feel how absurd it is to warn me against him. I dare say the passing attraction he felt toward me has already been forgotten by him, as it had been by me till the idle talk of Captain De Vere recalled him to my mind."</p> 
               <p>"He must be rather a desperate youngster to threaten a royal captain," replied her uncle, with a laugh; "but since your heart is safe, there has not been much mischief done."</p> 
               <p>Alina recalled her parting interview with Rudolph, and a thrill of fear and pain shot through that false nature, though she coolly responded:</p> 
               <p>"Have no fears for me, uncle. I can manage my own affairs with prudence, and be assured that when so serious a thing as marriage is in question, I shall be guided by the advice of my friends."</p> 
               <p>"That is right, my little woman. You are too attractive not to be admired, and it pleases me to see you attended to, but you must not forget that the sentimental nonsense these young men entertain you with is but the foam on the wave of life, whose sparkling glitter would be lost if you attempted to grasp it as a tangible reality."</p> 
               <p>"I understand that perfectly, and shall guide myself accordingly."</p> 
               <p>"I must say, child, that you have an old head on young shoulders. Your tact is really wonderful."</p> 
               <p>"Tact?" asked Helen. "What is that? for I am sure I have not the least idea what it means."</p> 
               <p>"Nor will ever have, I am afraid," said her father. "You are too downright to practice anything of the sort, Helen. You and your cousin are as opposite as the two poles of an electric battery."</p> 
               <p>"Is that the reason she always repels me?" was the quick response.</p> 
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6349-00000052"/> 
               <p>"What a scientific young lady you are, to be sure; but you must not say that your adopted sister repels you. Alina will love you, if you permit her to do so."</p> 
               <p>"But she doesn't love me. She never plays with me, and she never caresses me as you and Madame do, and when I follow her she finds some excuse to send me away."</p> 
               <p>"Because you follow me only to spy on me, and repeat what you have learned, as you have done this morning," retorted Alina, resentfully. "I dare say I should be very fond of you, if you would attend to your own affairs, and let mine alone."</p> 
               <p>"Would you? Well, I will try and be very good, to-day at least; but you know, coz, I am the <emph>positive</emph> pole if I am either, and I have no tact, so you must excuse me if I forget."</p> 
               <p>"Helen, let your cousin alone, and learn your morning lessons," said Col. Fitzhugh, with authority. "This discussion has lasted long enough, and I desire that you will cease to annoy her. Madame Girand and myself can watch over her, without any assistance from you. There, my daughter; I am not offended with you, but get to work-to work, for that is the grand harmonizer of life."</p> 
               <p>Helen grasped his hand as he passed her on his way from the room, and held up her lips for a kiss.</p> 
               <p>As he stooped forward to bestow it, she whispered:</p> 
               <p>"I'll let her alone if you are vexed; but it is such fun to teaze her, and then I have nothing else to amuse me in this dull place."</p> 
               <p>He shook his finger at her, and replied, in the same tone:</p> 
               <p>"You must forbear, my little girl, or Alina will never love you, and I wish you to be sisters in affection. Your cousin has neither father nor mother, brother nor sister, and we must be all these to her."</p> 
                
               <p>Helen nodded her head gravely; but when the door closed on him, she turned her eyes curiously upon her cousin, and wondered in her childish way, if Alina felt the need of the tender ties to which her father had referred. She shook her curls gravely as she came to the conclusion that her adopted sister cared for nothing but admiration, and Helen made many sage resolutions to suffer Alina to pursue her course unmolested-resolutions she soon found it impossible to keep, for her quick observation could not be baffled, and her tongue would chatter of what she saw.</p> 
               <p>This scene is but a specimen of many that occurred, and it required all the tact of Madame Girand, and all the calm good sense of Colonel Fitzhugh to prevent open warfare from being declared between the two. Alina, as the elder and the dependent, felt that she must restrain the expression of her resentment; but it only sunk deeper and gained more intensity, from this enforced self-control. She tolerated Helen, but in her heart she detested her, and panted for the hour to arrive in which she could be freed forever from her espionage.</p> 
               <p>In the three years that followed her entrance into her uncle's family, Alina matured into a beautiful and precocious woman of the world. She thought of her first dream of romance with a smile of disdain, though at long intervals she still continued to receive letters from Rudolph, breathing the same ardent affection, the same trusting hope in the future, with which they had parted. She knew that he had gained brilliant distinction under Col. Calvert; that by his daring courage, and exquisite strategical ability, he had already risen to the rank of captain; and sometimes the fear that he would really acquire the right to claim her troth, thrilled her with a vague dread which she could not conquer.</p> 
               <p>De Vere did not relax in his devotion, and a skilful<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6349-00000053"/> game was played on either side, ending, as such things are apt to do, in the complete enthrallment of both parties. Alina's ambition, her worldliness of nature, were gratified by the contemplation of the future that would open to her as his wife, and she soon felt too secure in her power over him to fear the influence his family might exert against their union.</p> 
               <p>Yet De Vere was far from gaining from her any assurance that he was beloved. The same inexplicable enchanting enigma she continued to be to him as in the first days of their acquaintance; and in this lay the spell of her power. She knew that if once assured of her attachment, De Vere would cease to value it as the first of blessings, and she only gave him glimpses of hope, which lured him on from day to day in the pursuit of one he had well named an <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ignis fatuus.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>During those years Col. Fitzhugh had been removed from the command of Fort Norfolk, and placed in active service. Mrs. Stanmore's predictions were verified with regard to Madame Girand, for she became his wife before he placed himself at the head of his regiment. When Philadelphia fell into the hands of the British, he removed his family thither; and Alina, then in the first radiant flush of womanhood, participated in all the gaieties of that brilliant winter-the last sparkle of the British crown before its fairest gem was torn from it by the sturdy freemen who struck for the rights of men.</p> 
               <p>At this time Alina was an exquisitely lovely creature. Her form had rounded into perfect symmetry, and her face had gained a mingled expression of spirit and intelligence, which harmonized with her fearless bearing and sparkling wit. Wherever she appeared, other women, far more worthy to be loved, were thrown in the shade by her brilliant attractions, and the fair Derval became the idol of the hour.</p> 
                
               <p>But amid this intoxication, Mrs. Fitzhugh did not permit her to forget her true interests. She kept constantly before her the necessity of preserving the devotion of De Vere, for he was the best match she could hope to win in the western world. He was the eldest son of a baronet, who was old and in feeble health, and the heir to great wealth. De Vere could place her in the proudest position to which she could aspire, and thus tutored, Alina guarded her conduct toward her lover so carefully, that she only made him wretched without positively exciting his jealousy.</p> 
               <p>"My dear," remonstrated Mrs. Fitzhugh, "are you not carrying things a little too far? De Vere is moody and hard to manage of late. You try him too severely: he tells me that he can gain no positive pledge from you."</p> 
               <p>"What more can he ask?" replied Alina, with a curling lip. "Does he not guard me like a Cerberus, and look ferocious if I but smile on my partner in the dance? I understand my part, believe me, and I intend to play it out to the end. If Captain De Vere were <emph>sure</emph> of me, he would cease to care about me. It is because I puzzle and vex him continually that he thinks of me: I understand the art of angling, and this man requires all the skill of her who would eventually secure him in the matrimonial net."</p> 
               <p>The listener laughed, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I give up to your superior finesse. You have gone beyond my teachings, and proved yourself mistress of Arts. Only become Lady De Vere, and I shall be contented."</p> 
               <p>"It is my purpose to marry him when his father gives him the power to make me my lady. In the meantime I enjoy my youth, and amuse myself; that is enough for the present, is it not?"</p> 
               <p>"For the present, yes; but give your poor sighing swain a little more hope, for he begins to look as if he is dying<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6349-00000054"/> of that 'green and yellow melancholy,' of which Shakespeare sings."</p> 
               <p>"Alina's mocking laugh rang out, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"'Men have died, and worms have eat them, but not for love.' However, I will bear in mind what you have said, and take measures to put the captain in a better humor."</p> 
               <p>Helen came in reading a paper she held in her hand. She spoke with animation:</p> 
               <p>"Here is something that should interest you, cousin, for it concerns that young Rudolph who once made such desperate love to you."</p> 
               <p>Alina grew slightly pale as she asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is it, Helen? Is he wounded?-or-dead?"</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed. He seems to be one of the fire spirits that pass unscathed amid the fiercest tumult of battle. Here is the paragraph-I will read it:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"'It is rumored that a select body of troops has been formed under the supervision of Washington himself, consisting of several hundred infantry, and horse in equal proportions. The men were picked from the army, and the officers carefully selected with regard to their peculiar talents. Among the latter, is Captain Rudolph, who has already distinguished himself by his daring bravery and strategic skill. This young officer has risen from the ranks, and bids fair to become a great military chieftain. The brave partisan, Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, is to command the legion, and we may look for such gallant exploits from them as will bequeath their deeds to undying fame, and enrol their names among the most successful defenders of their country's rights.'"</p>
               </q> 
               <p>"Why, Helen, you must have got hold of a rebel newspaper," exclaimed Mrs. Fitzhugh; "for such a paragraph as that was never admitted into one of ours."</p> 
                
               <p>"So I have," said Helen, exultingly. "Willie Stanmore got it for me. It is a dingy-looking little sheet, but it shows that these people are in earnest, and mean to fight to the bitter end. Don't you wish to see Rudolph's name in print, Alina? Here it is. If I were you, I should like his gallantry better than the devotion of somebody else, who wastes his energy in sighing, and leaves fighting to more martial spirits."</p> 
               <p>"Helen," said the warning voice of her step-mother; "I am afraid, my child, that your spirit is too belligerent for one of your sex. Why do you so often say to your cousin what you know must wound her?"</p> 
               <p>"I thought Alina as invulnerable as Achilles," replied Helen, "but from a different cause. My cousin does not care enough about her royal captain to feel anything I may say of him."</p> 
               <p>And this, at the present moment, seemed true, for Alina had scarcely listened to Helen's words; she hurriedly grasped the paper, and was deeply absorbed in the paragraph, her thoughts flitting back to that distant time which she so vainly tried to bury in oblivion. At intervals, the image of Rudolph would rise vividly before her, and the solemn form of betrothal by which she had bound herself to him, caused her to shiver before the power over her fate which she had thus given him. She felt that he would yet demand its fulfilment; that he would avenge her inconstancy upon his rival; and in place of rejoicing in Rudolph's success, she deprecated the thought that he was so rapidly placing himself in a position to claim the pledge she had given him. Helen watched her face, as she said:</p> 
               <p>"I do believe you are sorry, that your old friend has distinguished himself."</p> 
               <p>"No," replied Alina, haughtily; "I care very little about it. Captain Rudolph is of no more interest to me<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6349-00000055"/> than any other country lad who was known to me in my childhood. If he had espoused the right cause, it might have been otherwise; but now our fates are too widely sundered ever to bring us near each other again."</p> 
               <p>Even while she spoke these words, Alina would have given much to be able to believe in them herself; but a thrilling presentiment that her future was in some way unhappily linked with that of Rudolph, remained in her soul and possibly influenced the events of her after life.</p> 
               <p>A few days afterward, she received a letter from Rudolph filled with passionate protestations of undying love, and exultingly anticipating the time when he should win the right to claim the hand of his betrothed. Alina read it with a sickening heart, but she had not the courage to reveal to him the sad fact that her feelings were completely alienated from him. She rarely ventured to reply to him; for in the uncertain state of the country, the mails seldom reached their destination; and how Rudolph contrived to send his letters, was a mystery to her.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">DORA CALVERT.</head> 
               <p>THE years which have passed over Rudolph since we last looked on him, have matured him into a striking looking man. His tall, martial figure, high and well developed forehead, straight eyebrows, shading eyes of a deep, clear gray, and his firmly cut, yet gentle mouth, reveal the salient points of his remarkable character.</p> 
               <p>Gentle, tender and true, his distinguishing traits were great personal bravery, unparalleled coolness in the hour of danger, and a soundness of judgment in military affairs, which enabled him to profit to the utmost by the mistakes of his adversary. In action, rapid as a thunderbolt, yet calm as Fate itself, nature had bestowed on him two qualities usually deemed incompatible with each other. He never lost the equal balance of his mind, even in moments of deadly peril, but serenely surveyed the battle-field with the eye of a master, and swept down upon the foe at the moment that victory was certain.</p> 
               <p>In spite of his youth, Rudolph's great talents were soon recognised, and they received the meed justly due to them, in speedy promotion. Under Colonel Calvert his first laurels were won, and at Calvert Hall a portion of his furloughs were spent. There he was received as a welcome and cherished friend, for the old soldier had conceived for him one of those strong attachments which are almost paternal in their character, and Dora's enthusiasm for her youthful hero more than kept pace with that of her father.</p> 
               <p>Dora had grown into a bright and animated girl, with little that was conventional either in her nature or her manner. She was very independent in her ideas, and had established a code of action by which she was invariably guided. Those who had known her mother, declared that Miss Calvert was quite as eccentric as that lady had been, but beneath all Dora's peculiarities, lay a deep fund of true womanly feeling, which would keep her in the right path, even if love and happiness were to be sacrificed upon the shrine of duty.</p> 
               <p>It was a bright evening in May-four years from the day on which Rudolph had first assumed the garb of the soldier, when he drew near Calvert Hall to pay a passing visit to his late commander. Colonel Calvert was slowly recovering from the effects of a severe wound received in one of his gallant encounters with the enemy, and with deep chagrin he<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6349-00000056"/> felt that he was unfitted for further active service. He reluctantly consented to give up the best of his brave troopers to swell Lee's celebrated Legion, which afterwards rendered such efficient service to the country; but he felt that he was an invalid for life, and warmly recommending Rudolph to promotion, he resigned his authority over his attached partizans.</p> 
               <p>The slanting sunbeams fell upon the massive walls of the old house, built in the Elizabethan style, of bricks brought from England. It stood in the midst of an extensive woodland, kept with such care as to resemble an English park, and the evening sun-light cast flickering gleams of brightness upon the undulating surface now covered with the vivid verdure of spring.</p> 
               <p>Preparations had been made for a little festival, to welcome the guest whose arrival was so eagerly anticipated, and Dora stood on the piazza in front of the house, surrounded by a group of young girls. She held a laurel wreath in her hands, which her own skillful fingers had twined.</p> 
               <p>"Who is this for?" asked a young girl, extending her hand toward it.</p> 
               <p>"Hands off, Lizzie; no one touches this but myself, till I place it where it belongs, on the brow of a hero. Wait, and you shall see, what you shall see."</p> 
               <p>"Dora, you are the strangest girl! It must be for your father, for he is the only hero I know about here. The young men all go to the war, and so few come back, that I begin to think we shall never have any more beaux. Here are six young girls, and not a gentleman to pull caps for."</p> 
               <p>"It will not be so long, for one is coming who is worthy of a struggle, I assure you," was the merry answer.</p> 
               <p>"Who is it-tell us-tell us," was eagerly spoken by the different voices around.</p> 
                
               <p>"It is the young captain in the Legion, the protg of my father, who has shown such distinguished gallantry in every engagement he has been in."</p> 
               <p>"Captain Rudolph, the son of the old farmer who lives in the Glen?" asked Betty Mansel, the daughter of a tory gentleman in the vicinity who was noted for his pride. "Brave he may be, and doubtless is, but Colonel Calvert's daughter steps from her level when she twines a wreath for a yeoman's son."</p> 
               <p>The eyes of Dora flashed, and the warm blood leaped into her cheek, as she said:</p> 
               <p>"Beware, Betty, how you use such words now. The time has come to weigh worth against wealth, and the proudest aristocrat in this land may bow his head before patriotism and valor."</p> 
               <p>Miss Mansel curled her lip, and turned away without a reply. She drew with her one of the young girls, and when beyond the hearing of those they had left, she scornfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I do believe Dora Calvert is in love with this young man; and no wonder, for her father has made the most absurd fuss about him and his exploits. One would think him a second Bayard."</p> 
               <p>"So he is, if report speaks truly," was the reply. "I believe Colonel Calvert would be quite satisfied if his daughter made such a choice; that is, if Captain Rudolph should fall in love with her."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>If!</emph> Of course he would be only too glad to grasp at such a chance to place himself among the gentry of the county; but if Dora can so far forget her station as to accept the son of old Rudolph of the Glen, I for one shall cut her acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>The listener half smiled, but she gravely said:</p> 
               <p>"You had better not make up your mind too soon. Who<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6349-00000057"/> knows but this young officer may become a general, or a military dictator. I have heard that a great destiny was predicted for him in his childhood, which he seems in a fair way to realize."</p> 
               <p>"I don't care for that; he is still the son of those low foreigners that came here to escape starvation in their own country."</p> 
               <p>"I believe we are all descended from foreigners who sought this as a land of promise; and besides, I have heard that Mrs. Rudolph is a woman of good family. They are excellent people, and universally respected."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I dare say; people are always respectable as long as they pay their way, and do nothing that entitles them to punishment; but there is a wide step between respectability and high social position, such as the Calverts have always held. It is incredible that Dora should lower herself so much as to get up a fte for Captain Rudolph. If I had known that such was her object in bringing us together, I should have declined her invitation."</p> 
               <p>"It is not yet too late to return to your home, for the hero of the fte has not yet arrived," was the mischievous response. "It will be easy for you to escape taking part in our ovation to a revolutionary captain."</p> 
               <p>"I could do so, but Dora would be offended; so I suppose I must remain, and witness the absurd scene about to be enacted," and the speaker turned moodily aside.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime Dora had sprung down the steps, and crossed the lawn toward a summer-house, which stood in a grove of trees a few rods from the mansion. The door was open, and just within it, in a large chair, sat Colonel Calvert, the mere wreck of the stately man who had so nobly raised the standard of freedom at the first uprising of his countrymen. He had lost his right arm, and a severe wound in his body had caused partial paralysis of the lower limbs, from which he was slowly recovering.</p> 
                
               <p>Never again would he martial his battalions in the battle-field, and join the sacred strife for home, honor, and father-land. His strong frame was wasted to a skeleton, and his dark hair had blanched to silver whiteness in the years of hardship, toil and suffering which had passed over him since the fierce struggle commenced; yet his heart was undaunted as ever, and his faith in the final independence of his country unshaken. Dora threw herself upon a cushion at his feet, and raised her bright face to his, as she elevated the wreath she still held in her hand, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Is it not beautiful, and worthy of him for whom it is designed?"</p> 
               <p>A smile crept over his wan face as he said:</p> 
               <p>"You have a tenacious memory, my daughter. Is it really your intention to carry out the pledge you gave Rudolph on the day you first saw him?"</p> 
               <p>"Assuredly-I always fulfil my promises, and in this my--"</p> 
               <p>She paused abruptly, colored and looked out over the lawn with the vague expression which reveals that the inner sense takes no cognizance of what the eyes rest upon. The father regarded her with a penetrating glance, and presently he resumed the unfinished sentence in a tone of such gentle tenderness that the young girl did not shrink from the words he uttered.</p> 
               <p>"In this, your heart is interested? Is it not so, my daughter?"</p> 
               <p>Dora took his pale hand in hers, pressed it to her lips and bending her flushed face over it, said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my father, he is noble and true; he is a grand man, and worthy of the love of any woman."</p> 
               <p>"And he has sought your love? My daughter would never give her love unasked?"</p> 
               <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6349-00000058"/> 
               <p>A deadly pallor swept over Dora's cheeks, and she faltered:</p> 
               <p>"We are the best of friends, but he has never spoken of love. That he could not do without some encouragement from you; for Rudolph has too much pride and self-respect to seek the daughter of his early friend and patron, without his consent."</p> 
               <p>"He is all I can ask in a son. I will open the way for him to speak if he is attached to you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my father, how shall I thank you? You have made me very, very happy."</p> 
               <p>After a pause, Colonel Calvert said:</p> 
               <p>"Dora, do you know that your own sweet and loving heart, will be nearly all the dower you can bring to your future husband! The old acres have dwindled away, till only a few are left around the Hall as your inheritance; and the aged negroes that are on the place will soon be an encumbrance, in place of a help. Our fortunes have fallen, and men may say that Calvert of the Hall has given his daughter to a rising man to ensure her future prosperity."</p> 
               <p>"I care very little about what the world may say. I shall know that you have given me to one worthy of the devotion of my life. Oh, my father, to be the chosen companion of one born to so noble a destiny, is to wear a crown of joy, brighter than the diamond coronet of a queen. He will take me for what I am truly worth, and together we will build up name and fortune in the future. I can be a true helpmate to the man I love, and my dower shall be youth, hope, strength to do all for his sake."</p> 
               <p>"There spoke the heroic blood of your race, my child; and I know full well that you can be all you promise. My feeble and helpless age will be blessed indeed, with two such children to smooth my pathway to the grave."</p> 
                
               <p>"Father, speak not thus; you are not old; you are but feeble from your wounds, and already the hue of returning health is upon your cheek. Your steps are less uncertain, and soon you will walk among us restored to the enjoyment of life."</p> 
               <p>"It may be so, my love, and that is much to be grateful for, but never again shall I be able to grasp my sword and rally to the battle cry," said the veteran. "If I could have fought out the good fight, I should have died contented in the arms of victory. As it is, I am but a worthless hulk, fit only to be cared for as a child."</p> 
               <p>Dora arose, threw her arms around him, and laid her soft cheek to his.</p> 
               <p>"Dear father, you are still strong to counsel, clear in mind, undaunted in heart, and your name is honored among the defenders of the right. Let that suffice, for soon the struggle must be ended, and the fame that you have already won shall obtain for you honor and respect from all."</p> 
               <p>"You are a tender comforter, my child; with the independence of my country established, you settled in a happy home of your own, my work on earth will be finished; then I can say to the great Jehovah, 'Lord, I am ready for thy summons.'"</p> 
               <p>"But I shall be by no means ready to give you up, for you must witness and share my happiness," replied Dora, tenderly. "We will live together in the Hall, and in time, regain the lands that have passed from us. Industry, economy and good management, can accomplish even this, and I intend to be the pearl of good housewives."</p> 
               <p>The father smiled fondly upon her. He passed his hand caressingly over her hair, and seemed absorbed in thought. In a few moments the tramp of a swift rider was heard approaching, and a powerful bay horse bearing an officer, dressed in the blue and buff uniform of the continentals, was<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6349-00000059"/> seen winding through the long avenue that led to the house.</p> 
               <p>Dora sprang down the steps, collected her fair visitors in a group in front of the summer-house, and gave the signal to a party of sable musicians placed in the rear of the building, who played "See the Conquering Hero Comes," to their own infinite delight, and the further disgust of Miss Mansel, who regarded the scene that ensued with cold and critical eyes.</p> 
               <p>A boy had been placed upon the road to direct Rudolph to the summer-house, which was decorated with spring flowers, and seemed indeed a temple of Flora, for the fair maidens each held a basket of flowers to cast upon the path of the approaching guest.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph, bronzed with service, flushed with exercise, and radiant with pleasure at the thought of meeting his tried and valued friends, threw himself from his horse a few yards from the little temple, and with an expression of diffident surprise, drew near.</p> 
               <p>Dora, robed in snowy muslin, with the national colors, red, white and blue, knotted together upon her sleeves and bosom, with the starry flag of freedom floating over her head, stood upon the steps with love and welcome beaming from her eyes.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Calvert beckoned him to approach, and entering at once into the spirit of the scene, the young soldier moved forward with free elastic step, bent his stately head, and received the girlish offering, while the attendant nymphs scattered their flowers profusely upon his path. Dora said:</p> 
               <p>"Honor to him to whom honor is due. Captain Rudolph, the wreath promised in our first interview has been fairly won, and I thus redeem my pledge."</p> 
               <p>"And I, fair lady, return my grateful thanks for this unlooked looked for welcome. Little have I done to merit such honor; but it is not the less dearly prized as the offering of noble and generous friendship. This little memento shall be cherished throughout my life as its sweetest triumph."</p> 
               <p>He lifted the hand of Dora to his lips, turned and bowed gracefully to her companions, and then placing the wreath upon the point of his sword, lowered it before Col. Calvert, as he advanced to grasp his outstretched hand in the manly clasp of tried and faithful friendship. He warmly said:</p> 
               <p>"Welcome, my dear boy; you have gallantly fulfilled my predictions, and I am thankful that I have given to my country one officer trained under my own eye, and formed by my counsels. It is some consolation to know that, through you, I can still do something for the cause so near my heart."</p> 
               <p>"To you, dear sir, I owe all that I am," replied Rudolph, with emotion, for he was deeply moved at the change in his old friend. "But for your early recognition of such ability as I possess, I should not so soon have gained the position I now occupy."</p> 
               <p>"Do not thank <emph>me,</emph> lad, when God himself has stamped you as one of His chosen instruments. You have won, by your own prowess, the distinction of being appointed a captain in the new legion, and that is sufficient honor for the present. The future will give you something more substantial than Dora's symbolic offering."</p> 
               <p>"Yet that will ever be considered the most precious distinction of my life," replied Rudolph, pressing the laurel crown reverently to his lips; and the heart of the father bounded with pride and gratification, for in those words, uttered with such fervor, he thought there breathed a declaration of attachment to his daughter, as true and lasting as she had avowed for him.</p> 
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6349-00000060"/> 
               <p>Dora and her fair companions drew near, and Rudolph was presented to each one in due form. With ready tact he uttered a few gallant sentences, and even Miss Mansel was moved from her cold dignity, and marveled where the yeoman's son had learned the arts of polite society. Had she ever seen his gentle and refined mother, she would easily have comprehended that early training had as much effect in producing this result as his subsequent association with those of high social position.</p> 
               <p>At a signal from Miss Calvert, the musicians struck into a march, and, leaning on his young friend, Col. Calvert led the way across the lawn, followed by the young girls. In the wide hall a table, tastefully decorated with flowers, was spread, and over the two seats at the upper end, several flags were draped in long festoons held in place by wreaths of the wild rose. The effect was very graceful, and when the bevy of young girls gathered around the board in their white dresses and gay ribbons, the scene resembled a Mayday festival.</p> 
               <p>Light and joyous was the flow of conversation, and Dora performed her duties as hostess with the ease of one long accustomed to the duties of her position. When supper was over, the party adjourned to the old-fashioned parlor filled with heavily-carved furniture, and adorned with old family pictures.</p> 
               <p>As the evening wore on, the services of the musicians were again called into requisition, and the merry group danced till midnight, a playful struggle going on among the girls as to which one should have the honor of leading out the only beau among them, and the roguish fun with which Rudolph played the part assigned him, contributed no small share to the enjoyment of the hour.</p> 
               <p>Dora long remembered this evening as the last sparkle of her glad young life; she shone brilliant in animation and joyousness, for in her heart was the fond belief that Rudolph loved her even as he was himself beloved. No whisper of his attachment to Alina Derval had ever reached her ears, and in the years of frequent intercourse since he had become known to them, his gentle kindness, his brotherly solicitude for her welfare, had completely misled the impassioned girl as to his true sentiments toward her. Her love had been the growth of years, and now it was entwined with every hope of the future, while he held firmly in his heart the false one who was ready to betray him for another.</p> 
               <p>Alas! this was but another illustration of the cross purposes of life. We see indeed "through a glass darkly," and in our blindness lay violent hands upon the ark of safety that might have borne us triumphantly over the tumultuous waves of life.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
               <head type="sub">LOVE ME, OR I PERISH.</head> 
               <p>TOWARD the close of the evening, Dora, radiant, triumphant, stood at the head of the room holding a blue scarf in her hand, on the ends of which a laurel wreath had been embroidered by her own dainty fingers. With a gesture of imperial power she addressed Rudolph:</p> 
               <p>"I give you my colors, adorned with the symbol of your own prowess. As the dames of old chose a champion, I choose you as my Knight, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans peur et sans reproche.</foreign> Bring back this trophy when the struggle that now convulses the land is ended, and claim your reward. To the successful victor nothing can be refused that lady fair may honorably grant."</p> 
               <p>The last words were spoken almost in a whisper, but<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6349-00000061"/> Rudolph distinctly heard them, and he glanced quickly toward Dora to meet her expressive eyes filled with tender light. In that moment all was revealed and he shivered beneath the shock of this unexpected discovery. If, for a brief moment, his vanity was flattered, in the next instant his true manly feeling conquered the emotion, and dread, sorrow, and dismay filled his heart. He measured all love by his own heroic standard; for him, there was but one woman in the wide world to whom he could offer the devotion of his heart, and he feared that Dora was sufficiently akin to him in spirit to love but once, and then with all the ardent impulsiveness of her nature.</p> 
               <p>The reproachful thought came to him that he should have confided his betrothal to her, and thus have guarded her from the chance of misplacing her affections; but how could he have imagined that such a guard was necessary to the proud daughter of a patrician race? He had never once dreamed that Dora Calvert would stoop to bestow her love upon the protg of her father.</p> 
               <p>The hot blood rushed to Rudolph's brow; Dora saw the flush, and believed it to be the response of his heart to the words she had uttered. He muttered a few words of thanks, uncertain what he said, and only impatient to escape from the scene that he might have time to reflect upon the course he must pursue in this new and most embarrassing crisis of his fortunes.</p> 
               <p>The party soon afterward broke up, and Rudolph retired to the room prepared for him, in a whirl of contending feelings which kept him awake till nearly dawn. He rigidly examined his conduct toward Dora during the whole of their intercourse, and he could not bring himself in as guilty of a single action which could bear any other interpretation than that of brotherly regard.</p> 
               <p>Miss Calvert was lovely and captivating, but another, with her baleful charms, was before her; every pulse of his heart beat only for Alina, and he could give her no rival. Though years had rolled away since he last looked on her, not a day, not an hour passed in which he did not recall her young beauty as he had last seen her, and the ideal woman was loved more passionately in her absence than the real one would have been had she been ever near him; for the glamour of love is even more potent at a distance than when beside its object. The imagination then has full sway, without any drawback from the inevitable asperities of daily life.</p> 
               <p>Toward morning his perturbed faculties sunk into a broken slumber, from which he was aroused by a warning voice which seemed to ring in his ears: "Give up the false one-she will become the curse of your life. Give her up-give her up."</p> 
               <p>He sat up in the bed, with cold drops gathering upon his brow, for he fancied he could still hear the words vibrating upon the air, and he found it difficult to believe that they had not actually been uttered near him.</p> 
               <p>"Strange!" he muttered. "Those were the very words of the old Astrologer. My life curse! Oh, God! <emph>can</emph> this be so? Can such love as I feel for that enchanting girl bring wretchedness to the heart that enshrines it? I <emph>will not</emph> believe it. Away! away cruel doubts; I will give you no place to lodge in; true and loyal will I be to my chosen one."</p> 
               <p>As Rudolph was again sinking to sleep, a wailing sound like the wild music of an olian harp rudely swept by the wind, floated through the room, and died away in slow and mournful cadence; then it seemed as if the vibrating string snapped suddenly, and all was still. Thoroughly aroused, he listened for the repetition of the sounds but they were not renewed, and he bitterly thought:</p> 
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6349-00000062"/> 
               <p>"My good angel has chanted the dirge of hope and happiness over my couch. Foolish fancy! love and honor still live, and I will prove recreant to neither. Away-away, false prophet of evil! Alina is my joy, my life, my all; her or none!"</p> 
               <p>Wearied by fatigue and long watching, he at length fell into a heavy sleep, which lasted till the sound of the breakfast bell aroused him. Making a hurried toilette, he was ready to join the party below by the time the meal was served. Dora met him with a blithe good morning, and his heart sank as he thought of what lay before him that day. He felt that he must seek an opportunity of making his true position known to her, but how to do this without offending her delicacy, or wounding her pride, he could not see.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph made an effort to be as natural and gay as he had been on the previous evening, but it was difficult for him to play a part, and Dora, with the quick intuition of love, soon felt that something had gone wrong with him. She asked.</p> 
               <p>"Did you not sleep well last night? You look tired and unrefreshed this morning."</p> 
               <p>He replied with a smile:</p> 
               <p>"To speak the truth, my slumbers were singularly interrupted last night, and I marvelled if the Hall contains a haunted room in which you placed me to test the strength of my nerves."</p> 
               <p>Dora opened her eyes to their greatest extent, and Col. Calvert said:</p> 
               <p>"We are not aristocratic enough to have a ghost room. What did you hear or see in your chamber?"</p> 
               <p>"I saw nothing; but I was aroused by a strange wailing sound like a melancholy dirge, that seemed to fill the room with its dying cadence."</p> 
                
               <p>Calvert laughed merrily:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, I should have warned you. Dora has placed an olian harp in one of the windows of that room. Doubtless it was that which disturbed your slumbers."</p> 
               <p>"It is a simple explanation, but I am sorry to inform Miss Calvert that the strings snapped last night. I heard them break."</p> 
               <p>Dora became very pale-she faltered:</p> 
               <p>"Are you sure? It seems impossible, for the guitar strings I used were quite new, and it is only a few days since I put them up."</p> 
               <p>"Some sudden change in the atmosphere must have affected them, for I am positive that I heard them snap."</p> 
               <p>She said no more, but became so thoughtful, and remained so colorless, that her father marvelled why such a trifle should discompose her so much. Only Dora's old nurse could have explained the superstition she had herself inculcated. She had said:</p> 
               <p>"Put up de music strings, Miss Dora, for him you loves be's in de worl', an' ef you'm gwine to be happy wi' him, dey'll play a sweet lullaby; ef you aint, dey'll snap to onct. It's a nice way to try a young girl's fortin'."</p> 
               <p>Dora remembered this, and on the day before Rudolph was expected, she placed the harp in the window of his room, repeating with fond fantasy: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"Let music with its dulcet strain</l> 
                        <l>Tell him that our hearts are twain</l> 
                        <l>Or let the crash of broken sound</l> 
                        <l>Tell him of a mortal wound.</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Now these words came back to her, and she felt as if a mortal blow had indeed been dealt upon her heart. She could not shake off the impression this little incident had made upon her, and as soon as she could disengage herself from her young friends, she hurried to the window to see for herself what had happened.</p> 
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6349-00000063"/> 
               <p>The harp was shattered, and every string, save one, was broken, and fluttering in the morning air. Dora was superstitious, as are all tender hearts where the beloved one is concerned, and she fled to her own apartment to weep a few bitter tears over the unpropitious omen. But soon reason resumed its sway, hope again whispered its glad promises of future happiness, and she bathed her eyes, and rejoined her guests with restored calmness.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph glanced at her face, and read there the traces of the recent struggle. His intuition was deep, and he comprehended that Dora had found consolation in renewed hope; alas! that this must be crushed out by him who would have sacrificed so much for her happiness; but his love, his honor, his life were pledged to Alina, and he could not give her a rival.</p> 
               <p>Soon after breakfast was over, Col. Calvert invited him to a private interview, and together they proceeded to the summer house. The morning sunshine flooded the little pavilion, giving a melancholy brightness to the faded flowers with which it was decorated, and the young man sadly thought that one human flower would, in all probability, soon droop and wither as they now did, deprived of all that was needful to sustain their life and beauty.</p> 
               <p>When they had seated themselves, Col. Calvert said:</p> 
               <p>"What are your plans of life, my young friend, when the war is over? I shall be glad to be informed of them, that I may do what I can toward forwarding your future interests. I have long felt as a father toward you, Rudolph, and I have often wished that you were indeed my son."</p> 
               <p>The listener flushed deeply, and his heart beat painfully, at this opening. The truth must be spoken now at all hazards. He warmly thanked his old friend for all his past kindness, and gathering firmness as he proceeded, Rudolph went rapidly on:</p> 
                
               <p>"When the struggle for our independence is ended, my services will probably be rewarded by a grant of land, and I shall have my half pay. It is my purpose to make myself a home as soon as possible, in which I shall place one to whom I have long been betrothed. I have not hitherto spoken of this, because the hope that lay deep in my heart was to work out its fulfilment through my own energy and success. Now I see the end before me, and I may speak of the love that has been my great incentive to exertion. I have served my country with the patriot's devotion to her cause, but underlying that was the sweet hope that the distinctions I might win would entitle me to claim the hand of her I love."</p> 
               <p>"And that one-who is she?" asked the father, with a tremulous vibration in his voice that went to the heart of the listener; but he calmly proceeded:</p> 
               <p>"The first day I ever met with you, Col. Calvert, I came to Havre de Grace as the escort of a young girl, who had been received for several months beneath my father's roof. We loved each other; we exchanged pledges which no man of honor may violate; neither is it my wish to do so, for I still love Alina Derval as the one hope, the one reward of my years of toil."</p> 
               <p>While listening to this avowal, Col. Calvert leaned forward and concealed his face with his hand. His own disappointment, his daughter's anguish, arose vividly before him, and his strong soul was shaken to its depths. When Rudolph ceased speaking, he feebly said:</p> 
               <p>"I would that this had been sooner made known to me. I-I do not accuse you of deception, Rudolph, but perfect frankness would have saved much misunderstanding. Yet-no, boy-I wrong you; I feel that I do, because a bitter disappointment has come to me through this revelation. I had hoped--but it matters not now what I hoped. I am<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6349-00000064"/> still your friend, and I will do all in my power to promote your future welfare. Tell me of this young girl. Who is she, and what chances are in your favor? Her friends were English, and they may think even a successful patriot no mate for her."</p> 
               <p>That will not alter the result, for she is pledged to accept my hand, when, with it, I can offer her a home worthy of her acceptance. Miss Derval is the niece of Col. Fitzhugh, of the English army, and she has lately accompanied his family to South Carolina, whither his regiment has been ordered."</p> 
               <p>"And in the lapse of these years, exposed to the flatteries of so many young officers, do you hope that this young lady will still consider her promise to you as binding? Few women could remain constant to a childish passion, if exposed to such an ordeal."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph writhed beneath these words, but his faith in the object of his choice rose superior to such misgivings, and he quickly replied:</p> 
               <p>"I measure her faith by my own, and that is indestructible. The hopes of my life are staked on her constancy, and I have the firmest trust in it. Let this suffice."</p> 
               <p>A bitter sigh of disappointment struggled from the father's heart, but he repressed it, and presently added:</p> 
               <p>"Whither do you go after you rejoin the army? I trust this will be the closing campaign, and the blessed light of peace will once more beam upon this harassed land."</p> 
               <p>"I trust so-the Legion is under orders for the South; we shall probably be sent to South Carolina, as that colony sadly needs help at this crisis."</p> 
               <p>"And the fortune of war will probably bring you within the sphere of your betrothed. Such is doubtless the hope with which you go?"</p> 
               <p>Rudolph ingenuously replied:</p> 
                
               <p>"I confess that the dearest wish of my heart is to see my betrothed again. Our next meeting must be decisive of our fate; if she is true, I shall claim her at all risks; if she is false, my life is desolate. Yet no-that thought is unworthy of my manhood; I should suffer all the agonies of a lost soul, but I should survive them, for my mother has given me faith in God and his eternal justice."</p> 
               <p>The veteran grasped his hand.</p> 
               <p>"Nobly spoken: bravely felt; oh lad, every word you utter only deepens my regret for the hope that is lost. Go upon your path, with the blessing of an old soldier, and the assurance that he is your fast friend through life."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph warmly thanked him, and overcome with emotion, Calvert waved him away. Slowly and thoughtfully he walked toward the house, and on the piazza encountered Dora. She glanced at his serious face, smiled faintly, and sped like a lapwing toward the summer-house. She paused on the threshold, and looked apprehensively on the bowed head of her father, whose long gray hair floated over his face, concealing its expression from her eager eyes. He was not aware of her presence till she laid her cold hand on his, and faltered:</p> 
               <p>"What is it, father? What has so deeply moved you?"</p> 
               <p>Calvert drew her gently to his heart, and breathed in broken tones:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my child-my darling, fate wills that you shall be mine alone, that you shall be the sweet consoler of my failing life."</p> 
               <p>Dora trembled like a leaf shaken by the wind. She sunk on her knees beside him, and buried her face in his bosom. He felt the convulsive agitation of her frame, and comprehended the violence of the struggle she endured. At length she whispered:</p> 
               <p>"I have deceived myself-he does not love me. Yet-<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6349-00000065"/> yet since he knows he may hope, he may turn his thoughts toward me."</p> 
               <p>"Alas! my child, true love is ever involuntary; it cannot be nursed into life, and-and Rudolph has given his heart to another."</p> 
               <p>A faint suppressed cry, so full of anguish that it rent the heart of the listener, burst from her lips. She started up, pale with contending emotions.</p> 
               <p>"A rival! what-<emph>his</emph> heart, so noble, so worthy to be won, gone forever from me! and yet, oh! fallen maiden pride, he knows that I love him! He has spurned the offer of my hand-the devotion of my life, speak-crush me by telling me that it is so."</p> 
               <p>"My daughter, be calm-seek not to inflict self-torture thus. I guarded you from such a chance. I only drew Rudolph out with reference to his future plans, and with them, came the secret of his betrothal. For years he has loved a young girl, who, for a short time, was the inmate of his father's family; he will wed her, or none. Of course, after that avowal, our wishes, our hopes, were held within my own heart."</p> 
               <p>"Of course," she bitterly repeated, "and Rudolph spoke openly at last, because he plainly saw whither they tended. Oh, I comprehend this very well, yet 'tis not humiliation I feel so much as despair. Never will I love again! No other man shall call me by the sacred name of wife. To you I here dedicate myself, and should I survive you, the remnant of my days shall be devoted to the service of Heaven."</p> 
               <p>Her father took her in his arms, and tried to soothe and comfort her: to speak of hope for the future, but she drearily listened to his words, for they conveyed little meaning to her stunned and bewildered mind.</p> 
               <p>The sudden shock of finding that she was not only unloved, but that another image filled the heart she had fancied cied already more than half her own, was more than she could sustain. Her head drooped lower and lower upon his breast, until she lay white and lifeless in his arms. Helpless to aid her in this condition, and deeply alarmed, Colonel Calvert cried out for assistance. Rudolph, who still lingered on the piazza, heard the distressed summons, and ran rapidly toward the summer-house. He raised the inanimate form of Dora in his arms, rushed toward the house, and passing rapidly through guests and servants, who crowded toward him to ascertain what had happened, he placed the insensible girl upon a sofa in the hall.</p> 
               <p>The nurse, a venerable negress, brought camphor and sal volatile, her young friends bathed her face, and chafed her hands, and after a few moments, Dora unclosed her eyes, and looked with bewildered surprise upon the anxious faces around her. Rudolph had withdrawn from the group, and placed himself where she could not see him. She half rose, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What has happened to me? Why do you all look so frightened, and where is my father?"</p> 
               <p>"I am here," said Colonel Calvert, coming forward. "You have only had one of your old fainting spells, my child, that is all."</p> 
               <p>"Yet she never had 'em widout suffin had gone mighty wrong wid her," muttered the nurse. "What's come to my baby now, I wonder."</p> 
               <p>"Your <emph>baby,</emph> mammy," said Dora, with a laugh that sounded wild and strange, "I am no longer a baby, but a woman who can suffer and be strong. There-there, I am well now, let me get up and walk out in the air; I am stifling here; my heart seems to have a cord of iron around it, but it will soon beat free and strong again. Aye-free-<emph>free,</emph> for it will break," she muttered, as she attempted<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6349-00000066"/> to rise. Her eyes fell on Rudolph: she shivered, grew more deadly pale than before, and feebly said:</p> 
               <p>"Help me to my room. I-I am weaker than I thought."</p> 
               <p>Aided by two of her young friends, she arose, and after a moment of indecision, approached Rudolph, and steadily said:</p> 
               <p>"In a few short hours you must leave us, Captain Rudolph. I will see you before you go, for I have something I wish to say to you before we part, perhaps forever."</p> 
               <p>He bowed, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I shall be ready to obey your commands," and she passed on to her own apartment.</p> 
               <p>Betty Mansel whispered to Lizzie Lawrence:</p> 
               <p>"Incredible as it seems, I believe the rebel captain has refused the offer of Dora Calvert's hand."</p> 
               <p>"Hush-h-I thought you believed he would be only too glad to accept of it. Dora is subject to such attacks. I have seen her in them before."</p> 
               <p>"But they are always brought on by violent emotion. You heard what the old nurse said-depend upon it there has been an explanation, and Dora's hopes are dashed to the earth."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, we are her friends, and have no right to speak of her in this way, at any rate," and Lizzie turned abruptly away to seek Dora in her own room, and proffer her services as nurse. But the sick heart only asked for solitude, and she entreated so earnestly to be left alone, that her guests soon left her to the quiet she desired.</p> 
               <p>Quiet! could that wild, untamed heart ever find it again? Could that restless surging soul find calmness, before the last great change came to still its agonised throes-its rebellious anguish? This was Dora's first great sorrow-the first crushing disappointment of her life, and it bore down all before it; even reason for a time partially succumbed beneath it.</p> 
               <p>She was now in the fever fit of despair, and she was ready to dare all to save her bark of hope from perishing in the breakers that threatened it. Why should she hesitate? she wildly asked herself. Rudolph already knew all she could reveal, then why should maiden pride stand in her way? No-it should not. She was a human creature struggling for the life of her life, the love that had become its one hope; then why permit another, who could never love him as she did, to stand between herself and happiness?</p> 
               <p>Poor girl! let her not be too harshly judged, for hers was a pure and noble nature, overwrought in this crisis of her fate, and frenzied by this most unlooked-for disappointment. The spoiled darling of her father, she could not comprehend that she could not bend Rudolph to her will, as she had hitherto influenced all who had approached her.</p> 
               <p>The door of her room was no sooner closed on her friends than she arose, locked it, and paced up and down the floor with clenched hands, that at intervals were tossed wildly above her head, and eyes in which the storm of passion that swayed her soul was mirrored with startling vividness. The tornado swept ruthlessly over her, levelling all the barriers that pride and culture had sedulously erected to guard her in such an hour as this. She was reckless, desperate; she would speak or die. Let Rudolph go upon his way if he could desert her, but he should at least bear with him the sting of her broken hopes and desolate future.</p> 
               <p>Oh, bitter fate! that she, the pride and hope of an old man's heart, the cherished daughter of a haughty race, should have given all the wealth of her soul to one who valued it not! who loved another! He had said it himself, yet Dora madly clung to the frantic hope that filled her bosom.</p> 
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6349-00000067"/> 
               <p>From her childhood, Dora had been subject to sudden and inexplicable attacks of illness, ending in violent fever. The last was now upon her, and her cheeks flushed to a crimson hue, her eyes burned with lurid fire, and her whole bearing indicated the temporary madness that seethed in her veins. Her father came to her door, and begged for admittance. She paused in her rapid walk, steadied her voice, and answered:</p> 
               <p>"Not yet-not yet. I can see no one now; not even you. Come to me in half an hour, and then--"</p> 
               <p>The words died away in a husky murmur, and after lingering a few moments, Col. Calvert sat down in the corridor, and held his watch in his hand till the time expired, listening with silent dread to the steps that paced within that chamber, every footfall seeming to strike upon his heart. He alone comprehended that fitful and impressible nature, and he trembled for the result of such suffering to one of her vivid temperament.</p> 
               <p>At the end of the half hour, he tapped again upon the door, and Dora instantly unclosed it. In the interim, she had gained the outward mastery of her emotion, and she stood before him apparently calm, though the hand she placed in his was burning with fever. He looked apprehensively upon her, and said:</p> 
               <p>"You have one of your old attacks, I must summon Dr. Sinclair without delay."</p> 
               <p>"There is no need of him in this case; the fever is in my heart, father, and medicine can never lull it to rest. I shall be better soon; have no fears for me. I admitted you to say that I must see <emph>him</emph> before he goes. I will go into the library, and await him there. Send him to me, and let no one interrupt our interview. See-I am calm now-quite calm; you can trust me to bid adieu to my old friend, can you not?"</p> 
                
               <p>He regarded her searchingly, and after a painful pause, said:</p> 
               <p>"I can trust you <emph>both,</emph> my child; for you are the unsullied daughter of a long line of true women and noble men, and Rudolph is the soul of honor. Your pride of nature will not bow itself before a burst of passionate woe in the presence of one who is bound to another. Maintain your dignity as becomes you, and bid a final adieu to him who only seeks name and fame to lay them at the feet of his betrothed."</p> 
               <p>Dora choked back the hysterical sob that arose in her throat, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who is my rival? If you named her, I have forgotten."</p> 
               <p>"She is the daughter of Col. Derval, who was killed by a fall from his horse several years ago."</p> 
               <p>"What! Alina Derval! heartless, soulless-devoted to admiration; is <emph>she</emph> the one I have to contend against. Oh, this is too wretched a revelation, for she will render him miserable!"</p> 
               <p>"What can you know of her, and how have you learned this?"</p> 
               <p>"Betty Mansel has a cousin in the royal army, and his letters to her are filled with this young girl. He is one of her many adorers, for she smiles on all alike. Go now, father; I am quite calm. If Miss Derval is Rudolph's betrothed, she will never become his wife; of that, I am quite sure."</p> 
               <p>She closed the door abruptly upon him as she added, "In ten minutes, I shall be in the library. Captain Rudolph will find me there; let him not keep me waiting on him."</p> 
               <p>Col. Calvert slowly retired, and Dora put up her dishevelled tresses, arranged her dress, and prepared for the interview on which she believed so much depended. No-she would<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6349-00000068"/> not give him up to such a woman as Alina Derval: that was her final thought as she swept toward the scene of the approaching meeting.</p> 
               <p>The library was an old-fashioned room, pannelled with carved oak, and dimly lighted by windows with deep recesses in front of them. A large chair was drawn near one of these, and after arranging the heavy curtain in such a way as to throw her own face in shadow, Dora sat down with a tumultuously throbbing heart to await the appearance of Rudolph.</p> 
               <p>She heard his approaching steps, and thought they lingered unwillingly. A cold dread seized her. After all she might abase herself before him, and find only indifference as her reward. Her brain whirled; with difficulty she stifled the cries that rang in her tortured soul; and when Rudolph entered, with great effort she prevented herself from sinking off into another attack of insensibility.</p> 
               <p>Dora pointed to a chair she had placed near her own, and listened, without comprehending their sense, to the words of sympathy and regret for her sudden illness which Rudolph uttered. Wound up to the highest pitch of excitement, she suddenly placed her hot hand in his, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Must you go? Will <emph>nothing</emph> detain you beside me. Oh, Mr. Rudolph, can you hope to gain better or truer friends than those who have known and valued you from your youth? Speak, for you hold my life in your hands."</p> 
               <p>"And you hold my honor in yours. Dora-Miss Calvert, I am your brother-your best friend, next to your father. Suffer me to retain that precious distinction, and do not-do not force me to say that which can only wound you."</p> 
               <p>"I know what you would say," she drearily responded. "That you love another, and I-I am nothing to you. But she is false; you will find her so, and then you will turn to me to console you. Shall it not be so?"</p> 
               <p>Her voice sounded like that of a child pleading for something thing on which it has set its heart, but her face, her eyes were full of woman's passion, woman's despair. Rudolph raised her hand tenderly to his lips, and hot tears fell over it as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"You are ill and feverish, Dora, and you do not rightly comprehend the drift of your words. I shall forget them, as you will, when your health is restored. There-dear girl, lean back your weary head, and try and regain your usual tranquillity."</p> 
               <p>She rapidly said:</p> 
               <p>"You evade me. You cling to this baleful woman, who will yet bring woe to your heart. I love you-you know that I do so; but she only cares for her own pleasure-for the glare and glitter of life. She is unworthy of you, and you will find it out when it is too late-<emph>too late!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>The last words were wailed forth with a passionate intonation that struck to his heart, and he shudderingly recalled the weird prophecy that linked Alina's fate with his own for evil. He arose precipitately, wrung the hand that still lay almost lifeless in his own, and hoarsely said:</p> 
               <p>"My fate is fixed. I too love you, Dora, tenderly and reverently, but not as my future wife. The best and truest of friends I must ever be to you, but nothing more. Oh loving heart! noble nature! my soul had been willingly thralled by you, had it not met its mate before I ever saw you. Now it is too late."</p> 
               <p>Dora grasped his hand as if in a death-clutch, and gasped:</p> 
               <p>"You will yet turn to me in your desolation. In the darkest hour of your life, remember that <emph>I</emph> will be your good angel-that I will breathe consolation when <emph>she</emph> has inflicted anguish too deep for words to fathom. Go, go-I am faint, I believe I am dying."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph knelt before her-he uttered all that the most<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6349-00000069"/> tender and generous feeling could have dictated under such trying circumstances, but Dora lost all power to listen; she sunk away in a death-like swoon, and pressing one kiss upon her cold brow, he hurried in search of assistance.</p> 
               <p>Dora's nurse was watching in the hall, for she was aware of the interview that was passing, and felt the deepest apprehensions as to its result to her darling. When the old woman saw the condition of her mistress, she said to Rudolph:</p> 
               <p>"Help me to take my broken lily to her own room, cap'pin, dat dese strange gals shan't find out dat she's tuck another spell."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph raised Dora in his strong arms, and carried her like a child to her couch in her own apartment. The old woman busied herself in efforts to restore animation to her, and finding that he lingered to see the result, she turned her gleaming eyes upon him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"You'd better git out'n her sight afore she comes roun' agin. I don' need to be told dat <emph>you's</emph> de cause o' all dis, an' I tell it'll all come home to you yit. Tell massa to sen' for Dr. Sinkler right away, for de light o' his heart is in danger."</p> 
               <p>"I would save her life at the sacrifice of my own, if that alone were needed," he hoarsely replied, as he went in search of Colonel Calvert. The woman shook her finger after him, and muttered:</p> 
               <p>"'Taint that she wants, poor thing! 'Tis your living love that'll set her up agin, an' likely you's gone an' giv' it to somebody as won't vally it half as much as she does. But de will o' de Lord mus' be done."</p> 
               <p>When Dora recovered consciousness it was evident that her mind wandered. The physician came, and pronounced her in a violent fever; this he proceeded to conquer by copious bleeding, and the other severe remedies resorted to in that day, and she was soon reduced to a condition of infantile weakness. For days all consciousness of her recent struggles was blotted from her mind, and she raved in delirious frenzy, or lay white and still under the influence of powerful narcotics.</p> 
               <p>Slowly life regained its power in her exhausted frame, and with it came resignation to the fate she had so bitterly rebelled against. Rudolph remained at the Hall till after the crisis of her illness was past, but he saw her no more. Till her own words, wrung from her in the anguish of her soul, were realized, Rudolph was not again to look upon the living face of Dora Calvert. She parted from him a passionate and impulsive girl; she arose from her sick bed a chastened and gentle woman; but so cold, so reticent in manner, that no other lover found encouragement to utter the passion with which her charms inspired more than one. To be her father's comfort and companion seemed now to be the only mission of her life, and to him she devoted herself with all the ardor of her natural temperament.</p> 
               <p>Col. Calvert's health still rendered him unfit for active service, and he remained upon his paternal acres, husbanding his slender resources, and endeavoring to make them suffice toward maintaining such internal comfort and outward state as had been the custom of his family. Through Dora's skillful management much was effected, and her father saw her mature day by day into a thoughtful, intelligent and high-hearted woman.</p> 
               <p>In religion, Dora sought and found consolation for her broken hopes. She was a Catholic, and all that is tender and true in that faith found a response in her heart. It was now her firm purpose to devote her life to its ascetic rules when the only tie that bound her to earth should, in the course of nature, be dissolved; and she quietly but solemnly prepared herself for the change in her future life, when her beloved father should be removed from her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">HELEN'S CONCEALMENT.</head> 
               <p>RUDOLPH returned to active service in the Legion, in which he was conspicuous for his daring bravery, as well as for other qualities which secured him the confidence of his colonel, and the respect of his comrades in arms. In the attack on Paulus Hook, he led the forlorn hope, and in that desperate surprise and assault the gallant young soldier justified the confidence of his commander.</p> 
               <p>This post was held by a strong body of British and Hessians, and it lay in full view from the English garrison at New York, yet it fell into the hands of the patriots, and was considered one of the most brilliant achievements of the war. For this success, Col. Lee received a gold medal and the thanks of Congress. The reward of his young coadjutor was the enthusiastic commendations of those he led on to victory.</p> 
               <p>The Legion was then transferred to the Middle States, where their services were highly appreciated. After the defeat of Gates in South Carolina, the army of the South was re-organized under Gen. Greene, and Lee, with his body of tried veterans, was dispatched to form a junction with Marion. In the many brilliant services they performed, Rudolph was always conspicuous over all the junior officers of the Legion, and young as he was, he was promoted to the rank of major by brevet. In the battle of Guilford his bravery was especially noted; in that of Eutaw, Cowpens, and in the attacks upon the fortified posts held by the British, he displayed the most daring gallantry. Through his valor and dexterity, Fort Golphin, filled with stores of every description, fell into the hands of the Americans.</p> 
                
               <p>During this time Rudolph found means to communicate with Alina, and to his great joy he received a few lines from her in reply, referring to the past, and intimating a hope that they might meet again when the dove of peace had folded her wings over the land. Alina was then at Savannah, with her uncle's family, but Colonel Fitzhugh himself was in command at Fort Watson.</p> 
               <p>This was the next point to be attacked, and when Alina's letter reached her lover, Lee and Marion were jointly preparing to storm it. This stronghold was built upon an immense Indian mound, which overlooked the clear waters of Scott's Lake. The situation was picturesque and beautiful, and its defenders believed themselves impregnable against every attempt of the patriots, although they had no mounted artillery with which to defend themselves.</p> 
               <p>A consultation took place between the commanders of the Southern forces, and they naturally agreed that some plan must be fallen on to give their sharpshooters a fair chance against the English musqueteers. The readiness of invention, so characteristic of Americans, was here signally shown. Large quantities of pine trees were cut down some distance above, and in the silence of the night were drifted within point blank shot of the fort. These were rapidly and silently formed into square pens, which were soon run up to such a height as to overlook the defences of the enemy. In each one of them a squad of men was placed, whose deadly power with the rifle was well known to the besieged.</p> 
               <p>With the dawn of day the English discovered the device which their adversaries had used against them, and with sinking hearts they saw that from behind their log ramparts their assailants could pour into their midst a continuous shower of bullets.</p> 
               <p>At this point Rudolph commanded, and his object was to prevent the defenders of the fort from sallying out to obtain<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6349-00000071"/> water from their only well, which lay outside of the walls, or to take any portion of the stores that were in a military store-house, which was also beyond the intrenchments. The attempts of the English to accomplish either were baffled by the practised sharpshooters, who picked off every man who ventured to show himself beyond the ramparts.</p> 
               <p>Several desperate attempts were made by the besieged to relieve themselves from their audacious neighbors, but their balls buried themselves in the soft pine of their impregnable breast-work without serious injury to the assailants; while a deadly fire was poured on those who ventured to show their heads above the parapet of the fort.</p> 
               <p>But the defenders were true to their blood, and only after a gallant resistance did they yield possession of the fort and surrender themselves prisoners of war. The commander, Col. Fitzhugh, was severely wounded, and as surgical assistance could not be obtained nearer than Georgetown, he was sent thither, with the other officers, who had surrendered as prisoners. Rudolph, at his own request, commanded the party that took charge of the wounded man, and his blood thrilled with rapture at the thought of again meeting Alina, yet his heart smote him as he looked on her gallant uncle, and saw the price at which this happiness must be purchased. He saw that in the face of the prisoner which told him that his days were numbered, and in such a crisis his family must be summoned to his side. The wound of Col. Fitzhugh had orignally been severe, and the enforced neglect of several days aggravated it to that degree that when the party arrived in Georgetown there was little hope that medical aid could save him.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph succeeded in finding a lodging for him in the house of a widow with whom he had a slight acquaintance, and a surgeon was speedily summoned to his bedside.</p> 
               <p>"It is too late now to do me any good," said the wounded man. "A few days earlier, perhaps your skill might have been rewarded with success; but now, I feel that death must soon come."</p> 
               <p>After making a thorough examination of his condition, the surgeon sorrowfully acquiesced in this decision, and recommended him to make such arrangements as were necessary to the settlement of his worldly affairs.</p> 
               <p>"Such is my purpose," was the calm reply. "I have not so often met death face to face, to shrink from it now, but I could wish to see those I love before I go. Will it be possible to have my family brought hither, that I may bid them farewell? They are in Savannah, and could easily be with me before the end comes."</p> 
               <p>"For that, you must apply to Major Rudolph. He will, no doubt, do all that lies in his power, for he is as humane as he is brave."</p> 
               <p>"Rudolph? is he the officer in command? Then I am sure that my request will be granted. Let me see him as soon as possible."</p> 
               <p>"He is waiting in the next room to hear my report; and I assure you he will do all that lies in his power to soothe the last hours of a brave man. I will inform him of your wish to see him."</p> 
               <p>"Do so without delay, for no time is now to be lost."</p> 
               <p>In a few moments Rudolph entered the room, and drew near the bed of the wounded man, Col. Fitzhugh put out his feeble hand, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Your name is a guarantee to me that the wish which lies nearest to my heart shall be granted, if it is possible to do so. Nor will this be the first obligation for which I have been indebted to your family. My niece was once a guest beneath your father's roof, and in her name, as well as my own, I ask the last service which a gallant man can perform for his dying enemy. My days are numbered, and I must see my wife and daughter before I die."</p> 
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6349-00000072"/> 
               <p>"A request made to me in the name of Alina Derval would be sacred to me, even if humanity did not equally command me to grant it. A flag of truce shall be sent to Savannah, with a sufficient escort to bring your family hither in safety. I will at once give orders for their speedy departure."</p> 
               <p>Col. Fitzhugh thanked him gratefully, and Rudolph left his room in a tumult of feeling, which prompted him to hasten the meeting with the idol of his soul, by heading the party which would conduct her to her uncle's deathbed. But reflection convinced him that the duties of his position forbade this indulgence of his private wishes, and with many regrets, he saw a party of stout men at arms depart on this errand, their commander bearing a written request from the hand of Col. Fitzhugh, that his countrymen would permit them to pass on their errand of mercy, should they chance to encounter any on the way.</p> 
               <p>Several days must elapse before they could possibly return, and in the interim Rudolph devoted every hour he could spare to the service of Alina's uncle. All that the most tender nurse could do to alleviate his sufferings, and keep alive the feeble flame of expiring life till those he so yearned to behold once more could arrive, was done by him.</p> 
               <p>In his intervals of ease the Colonel conversed with the young partisan, and gradually Rudolph was drawn into the confession of his long-cherished attachment for his niece. The Colonel listened in evident surprise, and with some excitement asked:</p> 
               <p>"And has Alina encouraged you, through all these years, to hope that you might ultimately win her? Was there a pledge to that effect between you?"</p> 
               <p>"The most sacred one, short of the ceremony of marriage. We vowed to be true to each other through every chance, every change. I have kept my vow, and I believe her to be true to hers."</p> 
               <p>Fitzhugh groaned and covered his face with his shaking hands. A conflict of feeling seemed to be going on in his breast, and the silence became almost oppressive before he again spoke.</p> 
               <p>"My niece will soon be here, Major Rudolph, and from her own lips must come the decision on this affair. I have had other views for her, but recent events have dissipated them, and now, perhaps the best thing I can do for her will be to give her to a good and true man, even if he is in arms against his king. Death teaches us strange lessons, and in this hour I see the result of the present struggle more clearly than ever before. The independence of this country is inevitable, and in the land of her birth Alina may be as prosperous as I hoped she would have been in Old England. If such is her wish, I will not refuse to give her a protector in yourself before I die."</p> 
               <p>This was more than Rudolph's most sanguine hopes had anticipated, and he expressed his rapture at the prospect that so unexpectedly opened before him, in such fervent language as deeply moved the listener. Colonel Fitzhugh sighed as he recalled Alina's coquettish career, her light and heartless nature, and contrasted it with this soul of fire, this noble and true heart, which had preserved its faith unsullied through so many years of struggle and hardship, that he might lay the fruit of his toils at her feet.</p> 
               <p>What would be his reward? Should he not speak? Should he not tell Rudolph of her inconstancy? of her encouragement of another, till he deserted her? for De Vere had recently been summoned to England by the death of his father, and he had left without a word to Alina, to assure her that he would ever return to claim her hand. Honor prompted such a course, but Col. Fitzhugh reflected that his<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6349-00000073"/> own death would throw the friendless girl upon the world without fortune, without a home, for the slender resources he would leave behind him would barely suffice to support his wife and daughter in the sphere to which they belonged.</p> 
               <p>Alina was capricious, extravagant, and impatient of control, and her uncle felt assured that his widow would not long bear with her after he was removed. She and Helen were almost open foes; and, with a heavy sigh, the sinking man came to the conclusion to grasp at the only means of saving her from future temptation by giving her to her first lover. Once the wife of such a man as Rudolph, he trusted that his gentle, yet firm character; his high qualities, and, above all, his passionate devotion to her, would elicit the better traits of Alina's nature, and finally develop her into a faithful and affectionate wife. How his dying hopes were fulfilled we shall see.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph watched for the return of the escort with a feverish impatience he found it impossible to control. Alina, his hope, his dream, was coming to him, would become his own at once, for he never doubted her faith; unclouded as his own honor was his proud trust in the object of his choice. On the evening on which they were expected he impatiently paced to and fro before the house, watching with anxiety for some token of their approach. A distant bugle note was heard which caused his heart to leap in his bosom, and in a few moments a carriage appeared surrounded by a body of armed men.</p> 
               <p>Struggling to command himself in that moment of long anticipated happiness, the young officer watched its approach with parted lips, and eyes in which all the emotions of his soul were eloquently mirrored. It drew up in front of the house, and he advanced to assist its occupants to alight. First came a middle-aged woman, handsome and elegant, though now evidently in deep grief; then a young girl whose features were swollen with weeping, who eagerly cried out:</p> 
                
               <p>"Is my father living? oh, is he living yet?"</p> 
               <p>The reply of Rudolph reassured her, and she sprang from the step to give place to her cousin, who kept her veil closely drawn over her face, though she returned the strong grasp of her lover's hand with a tender pressure, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Dear Michael, at last have we met."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph was too deeply enraptured for words, but Alina read his eloquent face, and knew that he was as much her slave as ever. This was soothing to her wounded vanity, for the apparent desertion of De Vere had given a blow to her pride which filled her with resentment toward him, and the desire to prove to him she too had only played with feelings which had never touched her heart.</p> 
               <p>The ladies passed at once into the sick room, and Rudolph kept watch in the outer apartment to secure their interview from interruption.</p> 
               <p>Deeply affecting was the meeting between the dying officer and those that were so dear to him. With difficulty could Helen restrain the outburst of her grief when she saw him lying there so pale and worn, evidently hastening rapidly to the last home appointed to man on earth. Col. Fitzhugh had prepared himself for the interview, and he was more calm than those who were about to lose him forever. Even Alina showed much feeling, as he held her hand clasped together with those of his wife and daughter, though Helen, even in that hour, recoiled from its contact with her own.</p> 
               <p>As they increased in years, these two natures, so radically opposed to each other, had become more widely estranged, and Helen believed her cousin to be the very incarnation of falsehood and worldliness. Another cause of bitter feeling had arisen in the strong attachment the young girl had for De Vere. Helen was not in love with him, but the uniform kindness and attention with which he treated her, had won<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6349-00000074"/> a lasting place in her regard, and she considered the conduct of her cousin towards him as capricious and unwomanly. That he would be happy with her, even if Alina finally became his wife, she strongly doubted; for there was a deep-seated conviction in Helen's mind that she would only accept him for the sake of the station and wealth he could confer upon her.</p> 
               <p>News from England suddenly came that Sir Robert De Vere was dead, and the presence of his heir was necessary on his paternal inheritance. Permission for his return was forwarded, which Sir Henry Clinton confirmed, and as a transport was on the eve of sailing, no time was to be lost in embarking.</p> 
               <p>Alina had gone on an excursion into the country with a gay party, and an interview with her was impossible before De Vere left. He sought Helen, and what passed between them was known only to herself. She divulged nothing, but left her father and cousin to suppose that the new heir had purposely left without any explanation that could commit himself.</p> 
               <p>When this news was communicated to Alina, Helen watched her keenly, and she came to the conclusion that no deeper feeling was touched than pride and vanity. She saw that her cousin plunged with added zest into the excitements of society; that she coquetted more recklessly than before, and in the deep disdain of her honest nature the young girl believed that she had done right in withholding that last important conference with herself. Helen had very vague ideas of right, for that had not formed a part of the training she had received, and she considered it better for the future peace of her valued friend that he should lose his false love, than to find, after marriage, how little qualified she was to bestow domestic happiness.</p> 
               <p>Thus in the most important crisis of her life were Alina's long-settled plans baffled by the hostility of a child for whom, in her heart, she felt the deepest contempt and disgust.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE INAUSPICIOUS MARRIAGE.</head> 
               <p>REFRESHMENTS for the travelers were brought in, and after they had been partaken of, Colonel Fitzhugh beckoned his niece to his side, and in low tones said:</p> 
               <p>"Alina, there is one without who impatiently awaits an interview with you. He has told me all, my child. Consult your own heart, and deal with him honorably and fairly, as such a man deserves."</p> 
               <p>She colored deeply, and after a pause replied:</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely believed that you would listen to a proposal from such a quarter."</p> 
               <p>"Once I would not; but now things are changed with us. Our cause is declining-his is rising. A few more hours, and you will be deprived of my protection. Helen I can leave to the care of my wife, with a bare support for them both. You may share that little with them, but it will be a great change for you. I have denied you nothing, and your spirit is not one to brook dependence and straitened means."</p> 
               <p>"Say no more, uncle," she replied. "I have already decided on my future course. I will be no clog upon the resources of your widow. Since you approve, I will bestow my hand on him who has long considered it as pledged to him. You may think this avowal strange after the course I have pursued toward Captain De Vere; but I believe that ambition misled me, and his late conduct has effectually<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6349-00000075"/> destroyed the little regard I ever felt for him. Be satisfied on that score."</p> 
               <p>"Then you really love this young Rudolph. Through all, you have cherished the hope of ultimately being reunited to him?" he eagerly asked.</p> 
               <p>A faint, disdainful quiver crossed her lip, and her eyes gleamed with a strange expression as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"He believes that I do, and I shall do nothing to disturb his confidence in me. Have no fears for me, uncle. I will marry Major Rudolph; I believe it to be my fate, and who can escape that?"</p> 
               <p>There was a bitter recklessness in her tones which struck painfully on the heart of the listener, and he earnestly said:</p> 
               <p>"Alina, dear child of my dead sister, do nothing that will compromise your happiness. If you do not love this young officer as I feel assured that he deserves to be loved, you are deeply wronging both him and yourself. You are brilliant and beautiful-you can see others, and make a choice which will secure to you both home and happiness. Look into your own heart, and decide your fate."</p> 
               <p>For an instant Alina was touched, but after a few moments' reflection, she said:</p> 
               <p>"The die is cast; Rudolph loves me more truly than any other man ever will. I will try and be a good wife to him; he has faith in me, and I hope to deserve it in the future, even if I have used the privilege of flirting with others in his absence."</p> 
               <p>"Is that <emph>all,</emph> Alina? In the deepest recesses of your heart is there nothing which can respond to the solemn adjuration of the man of God when he joins your hand with that of Rudolph in the sacred bond of marriage?"</p> 
               <p>His tones were deeply impressive, and she shrank and shivered a moment; but the emotion passed away, and she calmly replied:</p> 
                
               <p>"Nothing."</p> 
               <p>"Then I give you to him, in God's name. Go to him-let him plead his own cause, and make known to you my wishes. There-I am exhausted, and must rest."</p> 
               <p>While this colloquy was carried on in suppressed tones, Mrs. Fitzhugh and Helen sat by a distant window, clasped in each other's arms, endeavoring to sustain and console each other in this most trying hour. A strong bond of attachment existed between them, and this was the one consolation of the dying man. He knew that his widow would be a true mother to his child; but he shrank from leaving his niece as a discord in their future lives, for he knew that Mrs. Fitzhugh bitterly lamented the fruits her own training had borne to one of the immortal souls committed to her charge. Alina had gone so far beyond her preceptress in the application of the precepts instilled into her, that she looked with dread to their future results.</p> 
               <p>Col. Fitzhugh trusted that in giving her to a true and honorable man, he secured her future from all risks; and with this hope, he fell into a calm slumber. His wife and daughter drew near his bed, and watched over him, while Alina smoothed her hair, and arranged her dress for the interview with her lover. She was paler than usual, but this was accounted for by the fatigue and emotion she had recently suffered; and when she passed out, and stood before the impatient Rudolph, he was dazzled by the vision of radiant loveliness that smiled on him with lips, and eyes, and uttered such soft words of greeting that, for an instant, he was dumb with rapture; but soon found words to say:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! Alina! angel of my life! hope of my heart, you are more beautiful than ever! And, oh! above all, you are true to your plighted troth. In all these years, you have thought of this hour as the crowning hope of your life, even as I have done. Is it not so, my sweet love?"</p> 
               <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6349-00000076"/> 
               <p>With unfaltering voice, but with a blush that tinged the transparent fairness of her cheeks with a charming rose tint, she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I too have dreamed of this meeting, Michael. I have followed your career with pride, and looked forward to the fulfilment of the dream we have so long cherished. What more can you ask of me? Is not this confession sufficient to assure you of my faith in you, and my fixed resolution to share the honors which have been won for my sake?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-for you I have toiled; for you I have risked everything. The salvation of my country, near as it was to my heart, was but a secondary object. You alone, the guiding star of my life, shone ever before, and in the hour of deadly peril, I have called on your good angel to shield me for your dear sake. Amid the storm of bullets, when men fell around me by scores, I passed scathless, shielded by the invisible armor of love."</p> 
               <p>She smiled, and shook her head.</p> 
               <p>"This is but a lover's fantasy. You have a great career before you, and Fate watched over her peculiar child. That is a more rational solution. Is it not?"</p> 
               <p>"It may be; but leave me my fond belief, for it pleases me best to think I owe my safety to the protecting gis of your love. Oh, Alina, such devotion as ours, lasting through years of trial and absence, surely merits a rich reward in the future. The hour I have so long dreamed of approaches, in which I can clasp you to my heart as my own true and loyal wife. Has your uncle told you what are his wishes and my own?"</p> 
               <p>A cold thrill passed through her heart, but she repressed it, and nervously said:</p> 
               <p>"He merely told me that he has withdrawn his objections to our future marriage; but, in his present condition, I can only think of him; I could not grasp at happiness over his dying bed."</p> 
                
               <p>"But my precious love, that is precisely what he wishes for. He would give you a protector before he dies. As your husband, I can aid his widow and child in the desolate position in which they will be left. Everything is arranged for our immediate union. The chaplain of our regiment is in town, and a few moments will suffice to summon him to the bedside of Col. Fitzhugh. Give me your long-plighted hand, at once, Alina, and I shall be the happiest of men!"</p> 
               <p>A bitter struggle was passing in the mind of the listener, and she turned her face from his ardent gaze, that, in its sudden pallor, he might not read the emotion-almost of repulsion-that filled her soul at this sudden proposal. Actress as she was, she had hoped for time to overcome the shrinking she felt from taking the last irrevocable step which would bind her to him forever. She tremulously said:</p> 
               <p>"This is so sudden-so unexpected, that I scarcely know what reply to make. A few weeks delay can make but little difference, and in that interval you can be our friend, as well as if you claimed me as your wife. Do not urge an immediate marriage, Michael, for-"</p> 
               <p>The voice died away in an inarticulate murmur, and he felt that the hand he held had grown icy in his grasp. He tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"You are frightened at my precipitation, but there is no other course left me, Alina. I may be called away at any moment, and if we do not seize this opportunity to link our fates beyond the power of man to separate us, I do not know when I shall be free to claim you. It will give peace to a dying man, to know that one of his beloved ones has a protector. I would not be ungenerous, my own love, but it seems best to me to be married without delay, for I shrink from the thought of your desolate position when your uncle is removed. Speak, love! Shall it not be so?"</p> 
               <p>After a long pause, Alina faintly said:</p> 
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6349-00000077"/> 
               <p>"Since my uncle wishes it, and you think it will be best, I can no longer refuse; but, Michael, if I should not make you happy after all! I am wayward, spirited, and full of fancies. This much I must tell you now, that in the future you may not reproach me if I fail to come up to the standard to which you have elevated me."</p> 
               <p>"You are all I wish you to be," was the rapturous response. "Failings we all have, and I pledge myself to bear with yours, as you will bear with mine. The holy bond that will unite us, will teach us the best way to render each other happy. I only ask of you to love me with all your heart, as I love you, and there can be no doubt as to our future. Cast that cold shadow from your angel face, my precious darling, for, in this moment of supreme blessedness to me, it seems to indicate fear and hesitation on your part. I trust that I misinterpret it."</p> 
               <p>His voice changed so suddenly-his eyes rested with so piercing an expression upon her, that Alina was alarmed lest he might read the truth. She summoned all her powers of self-control, and the color slowly returned to her checks as she murmured: "Is it not natural that this great and sudden change in my life should inspire me with deep emotion? I acknowledge that both fear and hesitation sway my heart, but they spring not from any dread of placing my fate in your hands. I know you to be the soul of honor, and I also know that I have never been loved as you love me. Since you risk your future with mine, let it be as you and my uncle desire. I will no longer oppose you."</p> 
               <p>Let us pass over the joy of the young lover; his ardent thanks for this concession, for they fell coldly on the heart of her to whom they were addressed, though she kept up the show of feeling so perfectly, as completely to deceive him.</p> 
                
               <p>Helen came to the door and said her father wished to speak with Major Rudolph a few moments. As the young officer entered the sick room, Mrs. Fitzhugh and her daughter joined Alina in the other apartment. Helen wondered what had passed in that interview, but she said nothing, and Alina remained silent concerning the momentous crisis in her fate that was approaching. Knowing what they did, her pride shrank from revealing the fact that she was on the brink of marriage with a man whose pretensions she had so long ignored.</p> 
               <p>Absorbed in their own grief, the two mourners soon ceased even to think of Alina, and when Rudolph issued from the sick-room, they immediately returned to it. Col. Fitzhugh beckoned his wife to his side, and whispered a few words to her. She listened with much surprise, and asked in the same tone:</p> 
               <p>"Is it actually settled? It seems incredible to me."</p> 
               <p>"It is, my love; and it removes a great weight from my mind. My niece needs a strong guiding hand, and a tender heart to watch over her. These I have secured for her in this noble young man, and he is desperately attached to her."</p> 
               <p>"But she-does she, can she love him, after all that has passed since they last met?"</p> 
               <p>"She has been pledged to him for years. She consents to ratify the engagement, and that seems proof enough that Alina has cherished a tender feeling for him, in spite of her encouragement of another."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh was by no means convinced of this, but she said nothing to destroy the confidence of her husband in the attachment which had been so long held in abeyance. Alina had long since emancipated herself from her control, and in her heart she rejoiced that the responsibility of her future career was to be removed from herself. She only asked:</p> 
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6349-00000078"/> 
               <p>"Shall I tell Helen, that she may be prepared for the event?"</p> 
               <p>After a moment's hesitation, Col. Fitzhugh replied:</p> 
               <p>"No-it is useless. They are not friends; and sometimes Helen is so <foreign xml:lang="FRA">brusque</foreign> with her cousin, that she may say something to annoy her. I have not strength to bear the scene that might ensue. Let them part in peace, if it is possible to do so. Rudolph has promised to see that you and my daughter are safely embarked for England; there you will find friends, and the little property I possess. That, and your pension as an officer's widow, will suffice for a respectable support for you and my daughter, and to the God of the fatherless and the widow I must leave the rest."</p> 
               <p>His voice sunk away, and his strength was evidently leaving him so rapidly that his wife, in deep alarm, applied such restoratives as were at hand to revive him. Presently he again unclosed his eyes, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Raise me up, and place the pillows so as to sustain me in a sitting position. Rudolph will soon be here with the chaplain, and everything must be in readiness to proceed at once. There is no time to lose, for I feel that my very minutes are numbered, and I would see Alina married before I die."</p> 
               <p>With tender care the service was performed, and a few stimulating drops were then administered to give him strength for the approaching scene. The chaplain-a middle-aged, intelligent looking man-presently came in, and after exchanging a few words with Col. Fitzhugh, sat down by his bed. Helen wept at the thought that he had come to offer the last consolations of religion to her beloved father; but when she saw Rudolph and Alina enter together, and place themselves in front of the couch, the certainty of what was about to happen flashed upon her. She became so pale that her mother thought she would faint, and for an instant she was speechless; but suddenly recovering from her emotion, she rushed rapidly toward Alina, and grasping her arm drew her to one side, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Cousin, you must not-you <emph>dare</emph> not do this. Come with me one moment; I have something to say to you that is vitally important. Oh, you <emph>must</emph> hear me."</p> 
               <p>Alina extricated her arm, and haughtily said:</p> 
               <p>"It is too late. You can have nothing to say to me that can now influence my fate. I shall soon be separated from you and your power to annoy me forever."</p> 
               <p>"And is <emph>that</emph> giving you to <emph>him?</emph> I promise to do better, cousin; only let me save you from yourself. Oh, listen to me for your own sake; for you do not love this man."</p> 
               <p>"He loves me, and that shall suffice. Loosen your hold upon my arm; it hurts me; and know that I would not be saved by <emph>you,</emph> even from perdition."</p> 
               <p>There was such bitterness-such concentrated hatred in the low piercing tones of her voice, that Helen's hands fell nerveless beside her, and she sunk upon a chair, sobbing bitterly. She felt how powerless she was in that moment, and she half resolved to cry out and forbid the marriage which was about to take place. Mrs. Fitzhugh came to her side, and spoke in her ear:</p> 
               <p>"Helen, it is the wish nearest your father's heart to give your cousin to one who has long loved her. Any violent agitation will kill him. See how weak he is; control yourself, if you would not shorten the brief time he has yet to live."</p> 
               <p>Helen saw that she spoke the truth, and after a brief struggle she said:</p> 
               <p>"May God forgive us all; I have done wrong, but it is too late now to repair it. Alina will not listen to me."</p> 
               <p>"Alina is more fortunate than I hoped she would be, for she will have a kind and attached husband to care for her.<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6349-00000079"/> Let that console you for any fancied wrong you may have done her."</p> 
               <p>At that instant the voice of the clergyman was heard commencing the solemn words of the marriage ceremony. He was an itinerant Methodist, and used only a portion of the Episcopal service; in a few brief moments Alina Derval was pronounced the wife of Rudolph, for good or for evil the bond was forged, and Helen felt that it was now too late to do what her conscience told her should not so long have remained undone. She did not offer to congratulate the bride, for she felt that congratulations on such a union as this would be mockery. Her heart sunk as she saw the radiant face of the groom, and she felt that through her an irreparable wrong had been done to him. Ah! if she could have looked into the future and beheld all the evil that was to spring from the event of this hour, she would have bowed her head in utter humiliation and despair.</p> 
               <p>Col. Fitzhugh wished to partake of the last sacrament with his family, and they kneeled around the bed and joined in the solemn rite, but Alina only bowed her head, and when the sacred bread and wine were offered to her, she touched them to her lips without tasting them. To her it seemed a mere form, but if its observance consoled her uncle, she was willing to pay outward respect to it. She believed in no future, and in no power, save that of her own subtle intellect and strong will. These should work out her fate for good or evil, and by her own strength alone she would walk in the difficult path on which she had just entered.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph, with his heart filled to overflowing with its great happiness, bowed his noble head, and prayed devoutly for the soul that was passing away, with no dream that in that solemn hour there was no sympathy between his feelings and those of her who kneeled beside him.</p> 
               <p>During the night they watched beside the sinking man, who confided to Rudolph his last wishes with reference to his wife and daughter, and he pledged himself to perform them. When the first rays of the morning sun entered the room, they fell upon the lifeless features of the gallant soldier whose last battle was fought, and Helen was taken from his side almost in a state of insensibility.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh went with her, and Alina wept upon the breast of her newly-wedded husband, who used all his eloquence to soothe and sustain her under the bereavement he felt assured she must feel so keenly. But not alone were Alina's tears given to the dead; she felt thankful for the excuse her grief afforded her to indulge her long-repressed emotions; and the bitter tears she shed were given more to the fatal necessity which had driven her into Rudolph's arms than for the fate of her uncle.</p> 
               <p>All her brilliant aspirations had ended in making her the wife of a rebel Major, whose fortune was yet to be won: yet even this was better than dependence upon her uncle's widow, and De Vere at least would know that she had not mourned his desertion. To strike a blow which he, in his turn, should feel, had been the moving impulse of this fatal step, and she stood upon the threshold of wedded life with a heart filled with resentful passion for one man, while her hand was given to another.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE FATAL LETTER.</head> 
               <p>THE remains of Col. Fitzhugh were buried with the honors of war, and his widow and daughter made immediate preparations to embark for England. After the lapse of a<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6349-00000080"/> few days, Helen's passionate grief for the loss of her father, settled into a deep melancholy, and her mother was glad of the prospect of change for her.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph obtained a furlough, and under a flag of truce conducted them to Savannah, where an opportunity to leave Georgia on a government transport was soon found. A British officer, suffering from the effects of severe wounds, was returning home for the benefit of his health, and he readily offered his protection to the relatives of his deceased comrade in arms.</p> 
               <p>Everything was satisfactorily arranged for their departure, and they hourly awaited the summons to go on board the vessel. Several weeks had elapsed since the death of Col. Fitzhugh, and so soon as Helen could arouse herself from the first stupor of grief, she set herself to watch her cousin that she might ascertain, if possible, if Alina's heart was in the contract she had formed. She felt the deepest remorse for the part she had played, and this feeling was deepened by the kindness of Rudolph to herself and her mother. She saw how radiantly happy he was; how utterly devoted to her cousin, and she had deep misgivings as to what revelations might yet come to mar his blissful confidence in the object of his affections.</p> 
               <p>Alina, at times, was depressed, but she played her part with her usual tact, and Helen began to hope that she was seriously attached to her husband. She feared to take any one in her confidence, yet she dreaded to leave without an explanation with her cousin. Letters from England might arrive any day, and Alina learn the deception which had been practised against her; and what would be worse, her actual position toward Sir Lionel De Vere might become known to her husband, thus effectually putting flight to all hopes of future happiness in their union; for Helen felt assured that if Rudolph's confidence in the object of his affections was once destroyed, he would become the most wretched of men.</p> 
               <p>As if in answer to her fears, a vessel from England arrived, and in the mail which was brought to Mrs. Fitzhugh was a letter addressed to Miss Alina Derval, in the well known writing of De Vere. The quick eye of Helen at once detected it; she grasped it with trembling hands, and excitedly said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! what shall I do now? What can I do?"</p> 
               <p>Her mother regarded her with astonishment; she asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter, child, that you should grow so pale over a friendly letter from Sir Lionel De Vere to your cousin? After his inexplicable conduct, it can be nothing more."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I know too well that it is much more. Mother, if Alina would only have listened to me on the night of her marriage, what I had recklessly done, might have been remedied. But she would not-she would not, and now the punishment has come."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh changed color, and sharply asked:</p> 
               <p>"What have you done, then? You surely have not come between your cousin and the brilliant settlement in life she might have made? Helen, I trust that <emph>you</emph> have not been the means of prostrating the hopes I had so long cherished for Alina?"</p> 
               <p>"I thought I was not doing very wrong, for I was sure she did not love him. No-if she had, she would never have married as she did."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh sat down breathless with surprise and anger. After a pause to recover herself, she said:</p> 
               <p>"Tell me all, that I may judge what is best now to be done."</p> 
               <p>"I would have told Alina the night father died, but you saw yourself how roughly she repelled me. Do not blame<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6349-00000081"/> me too severely, mother, for I thought I was doing right, though I have since doubted it. Captain De Vere left with me a letter for her, which I withheld; he also bade me assure her that so soon as his affairs could be arranged, he would return to take her back to England with him as his bride. I did not do it, for I did not wish him to marry so false a woman as Alina is. He is far too good for her, and I paid her back for all her bad treatment, by letting her believe her lover was false."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh listened in deep perturbation. She sternly asked:</p> 
               <p>"What was your motive for this? Do you love De Vere yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"No-no-I was not jealous of my cousin. I had no wish to rival her, but I like Sir Lionel too much to permit Alina to deceive him as she has every one else. Oh! it was very wrong, I now know, but I could not see it then."</p> 
               <p>Helen's contrition was so genuine, that her mother could not reproach her as she felt she merited. Perhaps at that moment Mrs. Fitzhugh comprehended how inadequate had her teachings been to impress truth or right on either of her pupils, and conscience checked the words she might have spoken in her anger. With a bitter sigh, she said:</p> 
               <p>"It is now too late to remedy the wrong you have done. Alina has plighted her faith to a good man, and it will be best to conceal the whole affair from her knowledge. I will keep this letter and return it to Sir Lionel when we reach England, leaving him to infer that your cousin preferred her first lover to himself. That is all that can now be done."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Helen, eagerly; "that will be best, and he will soon forget her; he will form other ties, and be far happier than he could ever have been with such a wife as Alina would have made him."</p> 
                
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh dropped the letter in her pocket, but at that moment an imperious knock came upon the door, and Alina, looking pale and excited, entered the room. She fastened her glittering eyes upon her aunt, and said:</p> 
               <p>"A letter from England has arrived for me. Where is it? Give it to me, for I must see it instantly."</p> 
               <p>Helen uttered a faint cry, and Mrs. Fitzhugh arose, and endeavored to speak calmly:</p> 
               <p>"Who has told you that a letter for you was brought to me? It is a strange assumption to suppose that I would keep back a communication intended for you, Alina."</p> 
               <p>"I do not accuse you of such an intention, Madame, but a letter certainly came for me, and was brought in with yours. You may have overlooked it; examine the mail again, if you please, for I must have what was addressed to me."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh confusedly turned over the letters, uncertain now what course it would be necessary to pursue; a cold dew gathered on her brow, and she drew out her handkerchief to wipe away the mist that arose in her eyes. With it came the letter, which in the excitement of the moment, she forgot was concealed in her pocket. It fell at Alina's feet, and was eagerly snatched up by her. She swept her flashing eyes over the shrinking forms before her, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What does this mean? What conspiracy against me has been carried on by you two? Tell me, for I <emph>will</emph> know; yet this letter will probably reveal all I wish to learn."</p> 
               <p>She was precipitately breaking the seal, when Helen sprang forward, laid a strong grasp upon her arm, and excitedly said:</p> 
               <p>"Alina-cousin, by all your hopes of happiness, I conjure you to forbear. Do not-do not read that letter, I entreat you."</p> 
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6349-00000082"/> 
               <p>Alina imperiously cast off her hand, and with lips that whitened with every word she uttered, she gasped:</p> 
               <p>"What does this mean? Oh, Heaven! have I been overreached by <emph>you,</emph> Helen Fitzhugh? You, whom I have loathed and despised with all the strength of my nature? If it proves so, beware!"</p> 
               <p>She sunk on a chair, still tenaciously grasping the letter, though powerless to open it, for a violent tremor had seized her, and her fingers refused to obey the impulse of her will. Helen shrank back from her harsh words, but the emergency nerved her with courage to say:</p> 
               <p>"Alina, you are now a wedded wife; you are adored by your husband; your future promises unclouded happiness if you will only perform your part as a true and faithful woman. If you love Major Rudolph, refuse to read a love-letter from another man."</p> 
               <p>"How should <emph>you</emph> know it to be a love-letter? The writer and myself are friends of long standing, and I have the right to see what he has said, even if my hand is given to another. I will read it, or die in the attempt."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh would have spoken, but her words died away upon her lips as she looked upon the pallid face and gleaming eyes of the excited speaker. She saw that remonstrance would now be useless; the die was cast, and for good or for evil, Alina must now learn all. The greatest dread now was that Rudolph might return to the house and ask for admittance before this painful enclaircissement was ended. Helen seemed to have made up her mind that a full explanation was inevitable, for she arose, unlocked her writing desk, and from a concealed drawer in the bottom brought forth another letter and laid it before her cousin. She steadily said:</p> 
               <p>"That was left with me by Sir Lionel De Vere the day of his departure. I withheld it, because I believed that you cared little about him. On the night of your marriage I would have revealed all to you, but you refused to hear me. Now it is too late. Burn these letters unread, Alina, if you value the noble heart that has given its all into your keeping, and forget that they were ever written."</p> 
               <p>While this revelation proceeded, the face of Alina was a terrible study. Anger, despair, desperation swept over its deadly pallor, and Helen felt with a shudder, that in that moment she would have struck her lifeless body at her feet, had her hand been armed with a deadly weapon. For an instant they looked into each other's eyes, and the younger and feebler spirit quailed before the expression of bitter hostility that flashed from those of the excited woman before her. Alina was the first to speak. She steadied her voice with effort, and said:</p> 
               <p>"So-o, you have indeed circumvented me; in the hope, I presume, that <emph>you</emph> would take my place in his heart, and become Lady De Vere. Ha! ha!-Lady De Vere! But I tell you that I would sooner doom myself to eternal destruction, than suffer you to reap the reward of your treachery. He is mine, <emph>mine</emph> in body, life and spirit, and mine he shall remain in spite of the tie I have been mad enough to form with another."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh here approached and laid her hand upon her arm. She warningly said:</p> 
               <p>"Speak no more in this strain, Alina. You compromise your future, and wrong yourself and another by such wild words. Helen has done wrong, and she deeply repents it. Do not crush her with such bitter reproaches."</p> 
               <p>"Wrong, Madame! Do you comprehend that she has torn me from the only man I ever loved, and forced me into the arms of one whose devotion to me is a punishment and a reproach? I gave myself to Rudolph in a moment of pique, that I might strike a blow upon <emph>his</emph> recreant heart;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6349-00000083"/> and he loved me, he loved me, <emph>he loved me!</emph> That is my consolation, and my despair."</p> 
               <p>She arose, swept to and fro wringing her hands, and weeping such tears as leave no peace behind them. As the rush of the tornado bears all to destruction before it, the violent emotions that surged in her undisciplined soul carried with them hope, peace, self-respect. The devotion of Rudolph was beginning slowly to win its way to her heart, but this untoward revelation uprooted every feeling of tenderness toward him, and she loathed the thought that henceforth she was his forever; that death alone could release her from the bonds that bound her to him.</p> 
               <p>And this had been the work of the despised and scorned child who had been the shadow on her path from the day that they had first been brought in contact with each other. Alina cast into oblivion all the kindness of her uncle, and listened only to the baleful cry of passion that rang in her soul. Suddenly pausing before Helen, who sat trembling and overwhelmed at the results of her concealment, she spoke, with intense passion:</p> 
               <p>"I declare undying enmity toward you; I will forget that we are of the same blood. For this wrong I will pursue you, and strike you in the midst of your happiness. Remember-I swear it, and will surely fulfil my oath."</p> 
               <p>Overcome by the whirlwind of anger and defiance that raged within her, Alina suddenly fell upon the floor in a violent convulsion. Her aunt lifted her to her bed, and used every remedy known to her to recover her before Rudolph's return. Alina still grasped the fatal letters, and it was impossible to loosen her hold upon them.</p> 
               <p>In deep agitation and alarm Mrs. Fitzhugh watched for returning signs of life, and when her niece again unclosed her eyes, she motioned to Helen to leave the room. This she readily did, for she was completely overwhelmed by the denunciations she had drawn down upon herself from the half maddened woman. On recovering consciousness, Alina's first care was to assure herself that De Vere's letters were safe in her possession. She lay panting and struggling a few moments, and then by an effort raised herself, and pointing to the door, said in a commanding tone:</p> 
               <p>"Lock the door, Madame. My husband must not find me ill, or engaged in reading the letters of his rival. Yes, his <emph>rival</emph>-for I love the man that penned these lines with all the passion I have to give. I have loved him for years, as you well know, though you have treacherously aided to give my hand to another from the base fear that I should be an encumbrance to you."</p> 
               <p>"You wrong me, Alina, for until this day I was ignorant of what Helen had done."</p> 
               <p>"Then why were you attempting to conceal from me, what Sir Lionel De Vere had written to me?"</p> 
               <p>"Because it is now too late to undo what has been done. If you had never learned this, you would have become attached to your husband; you might have been happy with him. I wished to conceal the existence of these letters for your own sake, and for that of him who loves and trusts you."</p> 
               <p>Alina sighed bitterly--</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Rudolph is good; too good for such as I am. I do not love him-I never shall, now, for a gulf has opened between us which no sympathy-no real union-can ever fill. My life thus far has been a lie, and such it must continue to the end."</p> 
               <p>"Do not speak thus, my child; your fate is in your own hands, and can be moulded to your will. Give me those letters-let me destroy them in your presence."</p> 
               <p>"No! No! Never while life lasts, shall these evidences of De Vere's love be torn from me! I will cherish them as<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6349-00000084"/> the last bright sparkle on the wave of my turbid destiny, for I feel that storm and tempest will whirl my bark of life upon the strand a broken wreck. The little within me that was true and gentle, has perished in the hour of bitter trial! Henceforth I am an outraged creature, who will redress her own wrongs as she best may: the means, I leave to Fate, but I shall surely find them."</p> 
               <p>"Alina, this is very madness."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," she wildly broke in, "I am mad, but there is 'method in my madness,' as you will one day find. <emph>You</emph> have taught me that conventional forms should not bind women more than men; that God is a myth, and Reason the only deity. Why, then, shall I be trammeled by a mere form of words, uttered by a human being deriving his authority from a source that, to me, is not divine? I will not! I will go upon my path, seek happiness in my own way, and break the fatal bond that binds me to a hateful destiny!"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh listened in appalled silence; the result of her own teachings stood before her in all their repulsive deformity, and she dared not raise her voice to combat them. She could only weep, and brokenly exclaim, "Oh, my child! My poor lost child, regard what I have taught you as the idle dreams of the philosopher, and clasp to your heart the faith your mother gave you. In this hour it is your only safeguard."</p> 
               <p>A disdainful smile swept over the pallid face of Alina, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"Such an appeal from you, Madame, sounds like mockery. My mother's simple faith lies buried beneath the superstructure you have labored to build above it, and by the lurid light of Reason I choose to be guided, in preference to the faint gleam which falls upon the narrow path of privation that, we are told, leads to happiness hereafter. 
                  <emph>This</emph> life is what I prize, Madame. It is mine to do with as I please-to fill with joy, or madden with despair. The first I choose, and I will find a way to carry out my purpose!"</p> 
               <p>"Alina, this is wicked. You are overwrought and wretched now, but you will soon see clearer. Reason will teach you that in the performance of duty alone can we find contentment."</p> 
               <p>"And do you think that a creature organized like me, will accept that poor and feeble counterfeit of happiness?" Alina fiercely asked. "Madame, your hand has lighted a volcano, and now you seek to prevent its explosion by such twaddle as you have just uttered. Nature gave me strong passions, firm will, and a vivid desire to play a grand part in the drama of life. The man I loved, could have given me the position I covet; and here I am, chained to a petty officer in a land reduced almost to anarchy; my dream of life broken by a ruthless hand, and I a bond slave to one I do not love. It shall not be! I will be free! Free as the whirlwind that rends all before it."</p> 
               <p>She fell back panting and exhausted by her own violence. At that moment a knock sounded on the door, and the voice of Rudolph asked:</p> 
               <p>"Can I speak with you a moment, Mrs. Fitzhugh?"</p> 
               <p>She cast a rapid glance at Alina, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"I will see him at the door. He must not know that you are here, and thus."</p> 
               <p>"Let him come in, if he will," she vaguely answered. "He will soon know that I am no longer his. Such love as he bears me, cannot long be deceived, and I am weary of the part I have been playing."</p> 
               <p>"No-I will save you from yourself," was the response, and Mrs. Fitzhugh merely unclosed the door sufficiently to enable Rudolph to communicate what he wished to say.</p> 
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6349-00000085"/> 
               <p>"My room is in confusion with my packing. Shall I go with you to the parlor?"</p> 
               <p>"It is not necessary. I merely came to inform you that in two hours the vessel will be ready to sail. Major Walters is already on board, but you and Helen need not go down till the last moment."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you; our trunks are in readiness, and can be taken away at once."</p> 
               <p>"Very well; in an hour and a half, I will bring a carriage for you and my little cousin. Do you know where Alina is? I ran to her room a moment, but did not find her there."</p> 
               <p>"She was with me a short time since," she evasively replied. "We cannot be long together now, so do not seek to detain her from me, if you find her."</p> 
               <p>"She is probably with Helen, so I will not interrupt her," and Rudolph turned away, and again sought the room, which, without his idol's presence, had no charm for him.</p> 
               <p>He threw himself in her chair, took up the needle-work she had laid down on going out, and, lover-like, pressed it to his lips. The delicate perfume Alina always used pervaded it, and seemed to him to breathe of her enchanting presence. The fulfilment of his long-cherished dream had, thus far, been to Rudolph a blissful intoxication. No cloud dimmed the radiance of his happiness; the transient depression of Alina's spirits he attributed to the recent loss of her uncle, and he loved her more tenderly for this proof of sensibility.</p> 
               <p>The portfolio lay open on a table near him, and he casually glanced at it. An anagram lay upon its leaves, which he idly attempted to unravel, but soon his brow darkened, and his breath came quick and hard, for he saw that it was the name of Lionel De Vere, which was made to read, "One ever loved."</p> 
                
               <p>This portfolio had hitherto been kept securely locked, and Alina usually carried the key about her person. With his nice sense of honor, Rudolph felt that he had no right to examine her private papers, but an impulse of jealousy he could not control, impelled him to turn the leaves precipitately, to see if any other memorial of De Vere was to be found.</p> 
               <p>A copy of passionate verses, bearing his initials, next met his gaze, and he read them with flashing eyes and curling lip. Why should his wife keep such things? She could not encourage this man, while bound to himself by every tie of honor! No! He would still believe her pure and true as heaven's light; it was wronging her to doubt her: he would look no further, for it was dishonorable to have gone thus far.</p> 
               <p>As he laid his hand on the port-folio to close it, and shut out further temptation, it came in contact with something hard beneath the leaves, which felt like a miniature case. He had given his own miniature to Alina a few days before, set in gold, and the thought that she had placed it there, with memorials of De Vere, was annoying to him. He turned the leaves quickly, and lifted a finely wrought chain he had seen her often wear since her marriage, which she said held a locket which contained the hair of her deceased parents.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph examined the dark and bright tresses woven together, and was about to replace it, when his finger touched a spring and the opposite side of the case flew open, revealing the face of the man he still remembered with utter detestation.</p> 
               <p>Had a venomous asp sprung forth and struck its deadly fangs in his hand, he could not more rapidly have dropped it. He stood with parted lips, staring eyes, and hair rising upon his head, as the certainty came to him that the chosen<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6349-00000086"/> of his heart, the wife of his bosom, carried clasped to hers the image of his rival; for rival he now felt assured De Vere had been-still was.</p> 
               <p>To one of Rudolph's open and confiding temper perfect trust in the object of his affections was a necessity. Without it, love must die a slow and lingering death, and with anguish that no words may betray, he felt that the first blow had been dealt at the very root of the happiness which he had hoped was to throw its sweet incense over all his future life. Why had Alina married him if she loved another? Why had she so bitterly deceived him? Better far to have given her up even to De Vere, than to claim the fair casket when another had rifled the gem it enshrined.</p> 
               <p>This very day she had evidently been looking over these mementoes-dwelling on the features of the absent one, while he lavished on her all the wealth of his soul to meet with this foul return. If Helen's revelation had been terrible to Alina, this was almost a death-blow to Rudolph, and he felt as if reason was reeling beneath the shock of finding that where he implicitly trusted, he had been most bitterly deceived. False as fair, she stood before him at last, divested of the ideal perfections with which he had invested her; a creature to be scorned, yet one who, spite of all, was passionately loved.</p> 
               <p>He felt this in every thrilling fibre of his frame; no-he <emph>could not</emph> give her up. She was his by divine right, and he would win her yet to love him. Assured that she might yet do so, he could forgive all, and clasp her to his heart in renewed confidence and affection.</p> 
               <p>Unconscious of the lapse of time, he sat with his head bowed upon his hands till a summons came from the hall, and a servant said:</p> 
               <p>"'Tis time to get de carriage, Major Rudolph, for de mate have come up to say de ship will start in half an hour, sar."</p> 
                
               <p>He started, slowly arose, and placed the open miniature upon the page before him, beside which he laid the anagram and verses. Thus Alina would comprehend that the secret was no longer her own, and the way be opened for an explanation. With a dull feeling of oppression he went out to order the carriage, and presently returned with it to find Mrs. Fitzhugh and Helen standing ready at the door, with bonnets and wrappings on.</p> 
               <p>The elder lady had parted from her former pupil with many counsels for her guidance, which were listened to with a bitter and pre-occupied spirit; but she could draw from Alina no pledge for the future, and she left her with the resolution to see De Vere on her arrival in England, and, if possible, prevent him from seeking the renewal of any intercourse with his former love, even by letter, since it would now only end in wretchedness to all the parties concerned.</p> 
               <p>Alina refused to see Helen again, and the remorseful girl wept bitterly over this evidence of her unforgiving spirit. She would have given much now to be able to retrieve her error, and bitterly felt that she had done evil in the hope that good might spring from it. When she parted from Rudolph on the deck of the ship, she begged him to forgive her the wrong she had done him. She looked in his face, and saw there the shadow that had fallen over it, and she intuitively felt that suspicion already darkened his confidence in the object of his idolatry. He sadly replied:</p> 
               <p>"You speak in riddles, Helen. I am sorry to part from you and your mother, for you have been with me during the happiest portion of my life, and you will henceforth be associated with my brightest memories."</p> 
               <p>At the last moment, Mrs. Fitzhugh whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Be patient with Alina. Indulge her fantasies, and she will eventually get over them. You will soon learn why I speak thus: show her that you love her through all, and you will meet your reward."</p> 
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6349-00000087"/> 
               <p>He bowed his head, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Such love as I bear my wife can do all, conquer all. If I did not believe that, in this hour I should despair."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh feared to ask how much he knew, or how he had discovered Alina's secret, and she parted from him in perturbed silence. Rudolph stood upon the shore, and watched the ship as she pursued her slow and sinuous course down the river, dreading the next meeting with Alina, and endeavoring to arrange in his tortured mind some method of action which would assert his marital authority, without farther alienating the heart which he now felt had not only become estranged from him in those long years of absence, but had been given into the keeping of another. Bitter conviction to come after one little month of unalloyed happiness.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE HUSBAND AND WIFE.</head> 
               <p>WHEN Alina was at last left alone, she arose, fastened the door of the room, and sat down to peruse the words of De Vere. The first letter was filled with passionate protestations of undying affection, and assurance that he would lose no time in the settlement of his affairs that he might return and claim her hand. Since it was impossible to see her before his departure, he would confide his letter to Helen, who would tell her all that he was unable to write. In a few months he would return, and carry her back in triumph as the future mistress of his ancestral home.</p> 
               <p>Alina read this through twice, dwelling with fierce joy upon his words of devotion, and more deeply execrating the being who had been the means of severing her from him.</p> 
                
               <p>The second one informed her of his arrival in England, of the enthusiastic welcome given him by his tenants on his return to his paternal home; of the magnificent inheritance, which he valued as the means of placing her in the position she was born to grace. His baronetcy was one of the oldest in England, with a clear rent roll of twenty thousand pounds, and fair prospects of reviving his claims to a barony which belonged to him as the heir of his mother. As Baroness Wilton he hoped some day to place a coronet upon her brow, and introduce her at court, where she would shine preeminent for her grace and loveliness. A few months would be necessary to arrange all these affairs, and then he would return to claim her plighted hand.</p> 
               <p>All this grandeur, which her vain and ambitious soul coveted as the only good in life worth striving for, she had relinquished in a moment of pique! Oh! it was bitter! bitter!</p> 
               <p>What could she do? Whither should she turn to disentangle herself from the labyrinth her falsehood had woven? Rudolph, with his noble soul, his adoring love, arose before her, and she shuddered at the unpardonable wrong she had inflicted on him; yet she loathed and recoiled from the tie that bound her to him. Yet, when De Vere learned that she had actually given her hand to her early lover, would he not turn with disgust from the contemplation of all her falsehood?</p> 
               <p>If she could only lure him back, a divorce would not be impossible; for when once convinced that all hope of happiness in their ill-omened union was at an end, Rudolph's natural generosity would prompt him to give her back her freedom. Yes-it must-it should be so. These letters must be answered at once, and the reply sent on the ship which had just left. Her course to the mouth of the river would be slow, and a faithful messenger could be found who<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6349-00000088"/> would place it on board in time to ensure its safe transmission to England.</p> 
               <p>Never doubting her power to carry out her plan, Alina precipitately arose and hurried to her room. She looked, with dilating eyes, upon the open miniature with the verses and anagram placed so carefully beside them, and she comprehended who had been there, and the nature of the discovery he had made. Fierce joy, mingled with bitter anger flashed into her pale face, and she muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Rudolph has been dishonorable enough to search my private papers; to open this case, that he might find cause of anger and suspicion against me. It is well-I will repay him as he deserves. Now my course is plain."</p> 
               <p>With feverish haste, she sat down, and dashed off the following lines:</p> 
               <q>
                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"You will see my aunt and cousin, and they will tell you that I am <emph>married,</emph> but they will conceal from you the fatality that led to that event. They will never tell you of the base deception which has been practised to separate me from you.</p> 
                           <p>Helen withheld your letter, and told me nothing that passed in that last interview between you. I was left to grow wild over the belief that all those years of apparent devotion had been merely for your own amusement at my expense. You know my pride-my reckless nature, when a wrong is done to me. To avenge myself, I felt capable of any sacrifice which would strike a blow on your heart.</p> 
                           <p>We came to the South-my uncle received a mortal wound-was taken prisoner, and when we were summoned to his death-bed, I found the officer in charge of him was my old adorer, Michael Rudolph. He still loved me-I was placed in a wretched position, for I felt sure that my aunt shrank from the thought of having both Helen and myself dependent upon her slender resources for a support. My uncle said as much to me himself; Rudolph offered me his hand, and to give peace to my dying uncle, to give a pang to your heart, if it could yet feel anything in which I was concerned, I consented. Oh! I was mad-mad! and I feel that I scarcely merit your pardon. Yet, if you love me as your letters assure me you do, you will accord it to me. You will pity me, and help me to extricate myself from the slough of wretchedness into which I have so fatally plunged.</p> 
                           <p>My aunt would have kept your last letter from me, but I learned, through a servant, that one had arrived, and I demanded it. This led to a revelation of the base treachery which has made me the most wretched and self-condemned of women. I love you alone, and my husband knows it, for he has discovered that I have worn your beloved image next my heart since I gave myself to him. I can never be happy with him-my heart is yours, and a shameful fraud gave him my hand. Rescue me as you love me-for nothing is impossible to a strong will and tenacious purpose.</p>

               <p>She did not dare to read over what she had written, but sealed it with feverish haste, and summoned the servant of her late uncle, who had been the intelligent agent of many commissions before this. The man had declined returning to England with Mrs. Fitzhugh, and he was still in the house. She knew him to be faithful, and a few dollars induced him to undertake the task of placing the letter on the ship before she gained the sea. This settled, and her rash words irrevocably gone, Alina sat down to await the return of Rudolph and prepare herself for the scene that must ensue.</p> 
               <p>Many hours passed away before he appeared, and when<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6349-00000089"/> Rudolph at last came in he looked so wan and wretched, that the heart not yet quite deadened to remorse quailed before the evidences of deep mental suffering that met her gaze. Yet she nerved herself to take the initiative, for she understood the advantage of being the first to attack.</p> 
               <p>The miniature still lay open upon the table, and when Rudolph entered, she pointed to it, and scarcastically said:</p> 
               <p>"So-o, sir, you are not above examining my portfolio in my absence. You have sought and found there what has told you that which I am resolute no longer to conceal. I was deceived into giving you my hand; that deception has just been made known to me, and I have the courage to tell you that it will be best for us to separate forever."</p> 
               <p>"Separate! Alina, are you mad? You would not so disgrace yourself-so injure me as seriously to propose such a thing? Accident revealed to me the face of that man, toward whom I swore mortal enmity years ago, and if he should cross my path, let him beware. If he has stolen the heart of my betrothed, he shall not with impunity sully the honor of my <emph>wife.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Your</emph> wife-no-no-if love alone can sanctify the tie of marriage, I am not your true wife. Every pulse of my heart repudiates the tie I have madly formed. I believed De Vere false, but he was true to the promises we had pledged to each other. Give me back my freedom; let me go from you, or see me perish in my bondage, for it is odious to me."</p> 
               <p>At these cruel words, the cold dew of agony burst forth upon the brow of the listener, and he regarded her with an expression of passionate anguish and regret, that would have moved any heart which was not steeled against him. Hers was as marble to him now, for she had spoken what had surged in her soul from the hour of their union. His words came forth almost with a sob:</p> 
                
               <p>"Then you abhor me, Alina. All the devotion of my life has been wasted on one as false as fair; yet even after this avowal, so enchanting are you to me, that I cannot give you up. What is this deception of which you speak, and who has been guilty of it? I, at least, had nothing to do with it!"</p> 
               <p>"No-I do not accuse you of that. Listen, and you shall hear all. When the end comes, as it must, you shall not say that I have a second time deceived you."</p> 
               <p>She pointed to a chair, on which Rudolph sank from inability longer to sustain himself; and in words that scathed his shrinking soul, she poured forth the history of her life from the hour she entered her uncle's house, down to the discovery she had that day made. She spared him nothing-she permitted him to see her in all the deformity of her true nature, that he might shrink from enforcing his claim upon her, for that was now her hope-her strongest desire. Rudolph gazed on her with eyes dilating with horror, and pale, parted lips, from which he vainly attempted to force the words of reproach that arose to them.</p> 
               <p>Alina finished her recital, and sat before him stern and immovable as fate itself. No blush had arisen in her cheek, no faltering was heard in the even monotonous tones of her voice. She told it as she might have read a story from a printed page, in which he had no particular interest; and yet she knew that this strong and manly heart was bursting with the weight of agony she thus threw upon it; that his life was laid desolate by her treachery-for had he not loved her as the one hope of his youth and manhood? She cared not-what was his love, his despair to her whose strongest wish was to fly from him forever-to blot out his very existence from her memory, if that were possible.</p> 
               <p>After a pause, which became intensely painful even to<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6349-00000090"/> Alina, Rudolph spoke in low smothered tones, that gained strength as he proceeded:</p> 
               <p>"In this hour you have destroyed the brightest illusion that man ever cherished. You stand before me stripped of all the charms with which my imagination bad clothed you; for I now see, that save your fatal beauty, you have nothing that a noble and true man can prize. Yet, Alina, I must save you; I must be true to you, when you are false to yourself. If I listen to your wild prayer for freedom, whither would you go? What would be your fate in the future?"</p> 
               <p>She recklessly replied:</p> 
               <p>"I care not. Only let me go from you. I uttered this prayer long ago, but you would not listen to it. Now, it comes from my lips with even deeper significance, for I cannot-no I <emph>cannot</emph> remain forever beside you, when all confidence between us is destroyed. I look calmly at facts as they are, but you would delude yourself with a vain hope <emph>Now</emph> I shall never love you."</p> 
               <p>"Yet the holy man of God pronounced us one, Alina, and the obligations we then assumed we may not lightly set aside. My confidence is terribly shaken, but it is in your power to restore it. You have acted with fatal precipitation, and nothing remains to us now but to bring order out of chaos; to bring back the wandering thoughts and fix them upon the duties that we reciprocally owe each other. Let your old feelings have sway over your heart, for you loved me once, Alina, or you are the most false of women. I will be tender and forbearing toward you; I will be thoughtful for your welfare, and I can promise to forgive all-to seek to forget my wrongs, if you will only perform your part in honor and good faith. If you leave my protection, whither would you go? Where take refuge in this wide and desolate world? The thought that you needed my care would render me wretched; for, oh! Alina, I love you still-I cherish you, as the darling of my crushed and bleeding heart."</p> 
               <p>He bowed his head, and hot tears gushed over his trembling hands. She felt her power, and even in that moment exulted in it. Whither, indeed, could she turn, if she persisted in her demand? With him she would be safe until De Vere could receive her letter, and act on it. If she left her husband, and her lover should also cast her off, what would be her fate? It would be best to wait-she must see the future clear before her, and then she would take her part decisively.</p> 
               <p>These thoughts passed rapidly through her mind while Rudolph was speaking, and with some show of emotion she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I have always felt that I am unworthy of you, and never more deeply than in this moment of trial. I have dared to tell you all, because I could not continue the course of deception I had commenced. Your greatness of soul enables you to forgive the wanderings of my heart-to seek to win me back to love you. I give you the power to do so-I retract my mad prayer; let us try and live together in peace at least-in time, it may be in love."</p> 
               <p>These words fell as balm upon the tortured heart of her husband. He took her cold hands in his own, and pressed them to his lips and heart:</p> 
               <p>"I have moved you from your harsh resolve to sever yourself from me forever, and all is now possible to me. I will win you back, my beloved; you shall forget this baleful man, and make my life precious to me in the future. I trust you, Alina, in spite of all that is past and gone, for with me love cannot exist without perfect confidence. Show me that you are in earnest in what you have promised, and I shall love you better for the victory you have won over yourself."</p> 
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6349-00000091"/> 
               <p>Alina raised her eyes, beaming with all their wonted softness, and looked into his, as she faltered:</p> 
               <p>"You have conquered. I fear that I shall be a sad trial to you, for I am wayward, and often irritable; but your noble trust shall not be abused. Yes-let us build up the shattered fragments of our broken hopes into a new edifice, in which domestic peace shall dwell, for that, my uncle often said, was the one desideratum in married life. By our joint efforts, we can at least secure it."</p> 
               <p>"With the help of God, we will surely do it," he solemnly replied. "Let us never recur to this bitter hour; let it be buried in the deepest oblivion, and in time its memories will cease to humiliate us. My protecting love shall cast its gis over you till yours springs responsive to it, and you shall find that he to whom you have plighted your faith, is worthy of the sacred trust confided to him."</p> 
               <p>Alina was touched by this noble confidence, after the cruel wounds she had inflicted on him, and for a few moments she believed that if De Vere should give her up, she would really make an effort to deserve it; but beneath all still lay the hope, the possibility, that she might yet enjoy the brilliant future she had pictured to herself, as the wife of the wealthy English baronet. Divorce could free her, and if events placed the power in her hands, she would find the means to make Rudolph yet desire it as much as she herself did. With her subtle power of deception, she would do nothing by halves. She offered him De Vere's letters, and said:</p> 
               <p>"If you wish it, you may read these before I destroy them."</p> 
               <p>He shrank back with a shudder.</p> 
               <p>"I would not touch them, nor read a line for worlds."</p> 
               <p>Alina lighted a lamp, and held them over the flame till they were burned to ashes, and then took up the miniature. Without one glance upon its dark beauty, she struck the glass that covered it upon the edge of the table, and dipping her handkerchief in a goblet of water that stood near her, wiped the painting from the ivory. Then turning its white surface toward him, she deliberately said:</p> 
               <p>"Thus will I efface the image of the original from my heart. See-my hand does not tremble. Set at rest all suspicion-all fear, for I will try and do what is right in the future."</p> 
               <p>Thus assured, who would not have believed her? Wounded to the soul, wretched as he was, Rudolph felt hope revive within him, and he clung to the illusion that she was touched at last by his noble self-devotion. Oh, yes-in time she must love him; and he uttered everything that could restore her to a sense of the new duties they had assumed toward each other. Alina listened with apparent docility, and Rudolph hoped that the storm had passed over his frail bark without utterly wrecking it. All the gay streamers, the noble sails which had been set before the breeze, were swept away, but a strong firm hand was still at the helm, and she might yet gain the haven of safety.</p> 
               <p>Oh! could he have looked into the crafty heart that still brooded over the possibilities of the future, he would have resigned the struggle in despair, and permitted the frail craft to strike and sink at once.</p> 
               <p>It is a trite truth that the noblest and best of men are most easily deceived, especially where feminine tact and guile are brought to bear against them. A few weeks of gentle and submissive melancholy on the part of Alina, completely reassured her husband. By degrees her manner toward him became tender and caressing, and he believed that she was rapidly learning the lesson she had set for herself.</p> 
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6349-00000092"/> 
               <p>Never was loving confidence more perfectly illustrated than in Rudolph's conduct toward her. He never alluded to that painful interview, and showed such tender consideration for her in everything he did, that any other heart would have been touched by his daily proofs of devotion. She received all as her due, and thought she honored him by consenting still to bear his gallant and untarnished name.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AN EXPLOSION.</head> 
               <p>RUDOLPH returned to his military duties, taking his wife to a small village situated in that portion of the country occupied by the patriot forces. Alina soon became an object of attention to his brother officers; and in the ennui of the interval that must elapse before she could hope to hear from De Vere, she adopted her old style of flirting with every presentable man that approached her. Yet so adroit were her movements, so veiled her coquetries, that he whose hopes were beginning slowly to revive, received the first intimation of them from a conversation he accidentally overheard between two young officers of his own troop.</p> 
               <p>"I say, Johnson," said one of them, "that is a spirited creature that our major has married. Ah! she's a whole team; but I wonder what he can be thinking of to give the reins into her hands. It's my opinion that she'll drive him to the deuce before she's done with him."</p> 
               <p>"Poor fellow! he's desperately in love with her, and she don't care the snap of a finger for him. She's the most out and out coquette I ever saw. Looks sweet on us all, from the colonel down to the sub-lieutenant; yet when Rudolph is by, she fools him to the top of his bent. I tell you that woman is out of place here. She's a born intriguer, and would make her way to the topmost round if she was in a court among people of her own stamp."</p> 
               <p>"It's a burning shame that the major, who is really one of the noblest fellows in the world, should have been taken in by such a woman."</p> 
               <p>Twilight had fallen, and Rudolph was walking near the bank of a narrow stream on a pathway that wound above a hollow in which the speakers were seated, leisurely smoking their cigars. Their words rang out on the still atmosphere so distinctly that he could not avoid hearing them, and for an instant he stood as one petrified. Then his impulse was to rush forward, and demand satisfaction for the insulting insinuations against his wife, but the sickening certainty that they spoke the truth, that Alina's name would be compromised by such action on his part, withheld him.</p> 
               <p>After all her promises she was still deceiving him. He hurried away from the vicinity of the speakers, and sat down on a knoll to think over all the incidents of the past weeks. To him Alina had been gentle and affectionate, and just as he began to dream of renewed hope in the future, this deadly blow came to crush his castle in the air. He could not become a spy upon his wife. His honorable nature recoiled from the thought, yet must he not save her from becoming the subject of such comments as he had just overheard? Save himself from the contempt and ridicule ever lavished upon a too complying husband? The dreary certainty now came to him that Alina had spoken the truth: she would never love him. The image of Dora Calvert arose before him, and in bitterness of soul, he murmured:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Dora, your words have come true; I but trampled on your devoted love to take to my heart the curse of my<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6349-00000093"/> life. Yet-oh! weak fool! I still cling to her; I adore her, in spite of all her treachery."</p> 
               <p>Since his marriage, Rudolph had constantly been in active service, and he only visited Alina at intervals when his duties permitted him to spend a few days with her. Under these circumstances, it was easy for her to keep up the show of increasing attachment which she had resolved on as the safest game for her to play, till assured of the success of her ulterior plans.</p> 
               <p>She watched with intense solicitude for the arrival of letters from England, believing that her fate would be decided by their contents. Alina left Savannah with Rudolph the day after her aunt's departure, and remained in Georgetown with a few other officers' wives, who were willing to endure every hardship to be near their husbands. The days passed wearily enough to her, and the only diversion to her ennui was found in the admiration her rare beauty always elicited. Unrestrained by any innate sense of principle, reckless of everything beyond the amusement of the hour, she soon gave cause for comments even more severe than those her husband had overheard.</p> 
               <p>At length Rudolph arose with a heavy sigh, and slowly returned toward his lodgings. As he drew near the house, he heard music and laughter, and approaching one of the windows that opened from a brilliantly lighted room, saw within a gay party of young people, of which his wife was the most prominent figure. A negro was playing an old violin, and they were engaged in the romping country dance known as "Hunt the squirrel." Of this Alina seemed the very life and spirit; she danced exquisitely, and all her coquettish graces were brought in play as she flitted from one end of the room to the other, now evading her partner, then glancing in his face with smiles, as she placed her dainty hand in his, evidently not shrinking away when he pressed it all too ardently in his own.</p> 
                
               <p>Rudolph looked on with sickening heart. Alina yet wore mourning for her uncle, and in such a scene as that, it seemed indeed the "mockery of woe." The dance at last ended, and still attended by her partner, Alina approached the window near which Rudolph stood, concealed by a thick growth of shrubbery near it. He heard the compliments almost bordering on a declaration of love that were whispered to her-and listened to the coquettish replies she made, so heart-struck, that for a few moments he was incapable of moving. Rocovering himself, he moved around to the entrance with firm step, and haughty bearing, entered the room, and walked directly toward Alina. She saw his face, comprehended that something had gone wrong with him, and hastily flitting from the side of her companion, with her winning smile, she gained his side, laid her hand softly upon his arm, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Let us go-I am weary of this scene. I but engaged in it to wile away the moments of your absence."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," he mechanically replied, "I am ill-let us retire."</p> 
               <p>Alina nodded and smiled to those she was leaving, evaded their entreaties to remain, and accompanied Rudolph to their own apartment. He looked so pale and stern, that she was alarmed, and after closing the door, anxiously asked:</p> 
               <p>"What has happened? Are you really indisposed?"</p> 
               <p>"I am wretched! degraded, hopeless of everything now," he passionately answered. "Oh, Alina, have you no heart in your bosom that can be touched by a true man's devotion? No respect for his honor, that you can make yourself the by-word and the scorn even of those who flatter you to your own undoing? This night I heard others speaking lightly of you, and I came hither to witness myself the confirmation of what they had said. I looked through the<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6349-00000094"/> window upon you as you danced and coquetted with Captain Woodson. I overheard his words as you stood near the window; words which you should have resented as an insult, but which you listened to with a smile; to which you replied in the same strain."</p> 
               <p>A deep flush arose to the cheeks of Alina as she listened to this outburst, and an ominous flash darted from her eyes. Her lips curled disdainfully as she said:</p> 
               <p>"You call yourself a man of honor, and as such I hitherto regarded you, but playing the part of a spy upon your wife, is a poor proof of it. My life is stupid to the last degree; I am cut off from everything that is desirable to me, and yet you complain because I seek a few moments' diversion in a petty country dance, and listen to a few compliments from a verdant young gentleman whose knowledge of society has not taught him how far he can, with propriety, express his admiration of a charming woman. If you think that a course of jealous tyranny is to win my affections, you are mistaken. In this hour you have dealt a fatal blow to the love that was beginning to dawn for you. I would have redeemed my pledge; in time, I might have--Yet why do I say what I <emph>would</emph> have done? when you have recklessly crushed out the first blossom of affection that has bloomed for you."</p> 
               <p>Aware that tears were her most efficient weapon, she here covered her face with her hankerchief, and sobbed as if her heart was breaking. Rudolph began to think that he had been too violent; he wished that he could doubt the evidence of his own senses, and restore her to the place in his respect which she had lately occupied, but that, alas! was impossible. He sadly said:</p> 
               <p>"I have done all that man can do to nourish that blossom, Alina, and if it possesses any true vitality, a remonstrance which is due to myself, will not destroy it. You are my wife, and you must avoid the breath of scandal. A flirting married woman is not long tolerated in this land of simple habits and stringent morals. A wife must be all to her husband or-<emph>nothing.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"If it comes to that, I will choose the last," she angrily retorted. "Cast me off-give me a pittance on which to sustain life, and you shall never see my face again. I will neither be your slave, nor conform to the rules of a society I disdain. I was not born to play the part of a meek Griselda, and I will not do it. No, even if I loved you, I would not."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph sighed wearily.</p> 
               <p>"I begin to feel that your words will prove true; that you will never love me. This sad conviction forces itself upon me, but even that does not lessen my responsibility toward you. I am the only protector you can claim, and my promise to your dying uncle must be performed. For good, for evil, our lot in life is cast together, and we must bear the yoke even if it eats into the soul and cankers there. 'Whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder,' has been promulgated as Heaven's law, and we must abide by the solemn decree. I <emph>demand</emph> from you respect for your marriage vow, and such circumspection in your conduct as will save you from censure. This much I have a right to exact, and I shall do so."</p> 
               <p>He spoke with such stern sadness, that Alina saw it would be dangerous to trifle with him in his present mood: so she only sobbed more bitterly, but promised nothing. A little while, and she would show him on what a broken reed he had depended when he trusted her. That very morning-a letter had mysteriously reached her, without the knowledge of her husband. It was from De Vere, in answer to hers, for many months had now elapsed since the departure of Mrs. Fitzhugh, and ample time had been afforded for the transmission of his reply.</p> 
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6349-00000095"/> 
               <p>In it he bitterly reproached her for giving her hand to his rival, and heaped maledictions on the head of poor Helen, whom he had not seen since her arrival in England. He had held one brief interview with Mrs. Fitzhugh, and left her to find Alina's letter waiting him. To answer it, after the first fury of his anger subsided, was his next impulse; and in that reply he told her that she had been so deeply sinned against that he could not withhold his forgiveness. He would come to her; he would tear her from the arms of Rudolph; but in the interim she must do nothing to arouse her husband's suspicion. With guileful sophistry he said:</p> 
               <p>"The rigid followers of our creed do not recognize the validity of a marriage performed by a dissenting minister. Fly with me, and a priest shall unite us at once; the last union will be the true one, and if Rudolph thinks your possession worth disputing, I will take such measures as will prove my better right to you, and set his claims at nought. Oh, Alina! if I thought that this man has really rivalled me in your heart, I should go mad. I will tear you from him, and leave him to banquet on his crushed hopes; to drink his own tears; fit punishment for him who has stepped between me and my adored one. A few more weeks and I can leave for America; hope, my angel, for I will come to your rescue as surely as the sun will rise to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>There was much more in the same strain, and Alina carefully concealed this letter from her husband. She read it again and again, and counted the hours that must elapse before the writer could be near her. This had given unwonted lightness to her spirits that evening, and the glad buoyancy with which she had flitted through the dance was but an echo of the happy beating of her heart. Such compunction punction as she might once have felt for the bitter wrong toward the heart that trusted her, was now dead within her, for she almost hated Rudolph as the stern arbiter of her destiny, and despised him for the very love he still cherished for her.</p> 
               <p>The capricious irritability of Alina's temper during the next week tasked the forbearance of Rudolph to its utmost limits. She refused to leave her own apartment; since, as she asserted, her most innocent actions were misenterpreted; and such pastimes as she found pleasure in were objectionable to him. She would abjure all society if she was to be criticised and scolded for everything she did, and when she had moped herself into a perfect piece of stupidity and dullness, perhaps he would approve her as a pattern wife.</p> 
               <p>She ceased all her wiles; left him to his wretchedness, in the hope that he would cease to love her, and when the final certainty came that she had indeed deserted him, he would not seek to avenge himself on the one who had supplanted him.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph had a furlough for but two weeks, and Alina saw the days roll away with the belief that they were the last they would ever spend together; yet she zealously sought to render every hour a bitterness to him. In that time, he was as completely disenchanted as it was possible for a man to become; and he almost recoiled from the thought that to this fair piece of subtlety and deception, he had given the power to darken his whole life. Yet such a passion as he had cherished for her was not torn up by the roots without a struggle that was more dire than death itself; and his pale, set features, the restless fire that burned in his eyes, betrayed the suffering that wrestled in his strong soul. Alina saw it, yet relented not in her purpose.</p> 
               <p>"He will hate, he will despise me," she thought; "but even that is better than his love."</p> 
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6349-00000096"/> 
               <p>On the last evening, they sat together in her room; but as widely estranged as if the circumference of the earth lay between them, for there was no chord of sympathy to touch the electric spark in the bosom of either. Rudolph had relinquished all hope, and in a kind of sullen despair sat down to look upon her fatal beauty, and feel how utterly its power had departed, now he comprehended that it was not the outward symbol of the angelic nature that he had believed it indicated.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly there was a commotion in the street; a messenger, riding in hot haste, dismounted in front of the house, and the words, "Naval engagement-Victory!"-met their ears. Rudolph looked out of the window, and spoke to the courier, who was eagerly detailing the news of which he was the bearer. He recognised the man as a sergeant, who had once served in his own troop, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is it, Judson?"</p> 
               <p>"Great news, major, for our side. There has been a fight between some French and English ships; our allies were victorious; but I have a bulletin here, with the account of the affair, and a list of the prisoners taken."</p> 
               <p>"Send it up to me a moment. I will bring it down myself as soon as I have looked over it."</p> 
               <p>Alina listened in breathless perturbation. De Vere's letter had been delayed, and he might be on one of the captured vessels. The very thought made her heart stand still, and she became so pale that Rudolph asked her if she was ill. She muttered some unintelligible reply, and listened with dilating eyes to the sound of footsteps ascending the stairs, for on the news the messenger brought she almost felt that her very life depended.</p> 
               <p>A small, dingy-looking square of paper, printed on one side, was handed in to Rudolph, and he eagerly approached the light to read its contents. Alina softly drew near him, and looked over his shoulder; she scarcely glanced at the details of the important victory that had been won, and her eyes flitted rapidly toward the following paragraph:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"Among the prisoners taken was a young English baronet who has served in America. Sir Lionel De Vere was sent to France on the ship which took thither the news of the engagement."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>The blow was so sudden that Alina could no longer control herself, and she fell back in violent hysteric spasms. Her cries drew the attention of Rudolph to her condition, and he lifted her to the bed, and used such restoratives as were at hand. He too had seen the announcement of De Vere's capture, and he comprehended the cause of her illness with a pang even more bitter than all that had gone before.</p> 
               <p>When her shrieks had sunk into long-drawn sobs, and she lay before him white and motionless, he ventured to leave her alone a few moments, and go below to mingle with the crowd which was discussing the event of the hour, and the probable effect it would have in terminating the war. He was warmly greeted, and his opinion eagerly sought; he replied briefly, but courteously, and those who knew him best saw that some personal grief was weighing heavily upon him. A torch-light procession in honor of the victory was hurriedly arranged, and he was solicited to join it; but he excused himself on the score of his wife's illness, and returned to her side.</p> 
               <p>In the interval, Alina had composed herself, and regained the power of thought. She had played her part badly of late; she had trusted too little to the chances of war; had too implicitly relied on the arrival of De Vere, and her dupe had been permitted to see too clearly all the hollowness of her nature. Her power over him was gone forever, and what would now be her fate? Rudolph would decide it,<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6349-00000097"/> and she shrank from the thought that her dependence upon him placed her utterly in his power. She felt assured that he comprehended the cause of her sudden attack, and she nerved herself for the interview that approached, calling up all her natural hardihood and recklessness to sustain her through it.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph glanced toward her as he entered, and then paced the floor with restless steps till he could control his voice sufficiently to speak with calmness. At length she burst forth:</p> 
               <p>"What have you to say that requires so much reflection? I am prepared to hear you, let it be what it may."</p> 
               <p>"I see that you are prepared," he replied, with deep sadness. "It is not very long since I took you to my heart as the most coveted boon of life, and now I pronounce the fiat that separates us, whether it shall be forever depends upon yourself. I will send you to my father's house, to remain under the care of my parents till you summon me to your side."</p> 
               <p>"What! immure me in that lonely farm-house, with no associates but boors? I refuse to go-I will not be dealt with thus."</p> 
               <p>"It is all I can do for you," he coldly replied. "My mother is a refined and noble woman; my father and brother will treat you with the respect that is due to my wife. My wandering life precludes me from watching over you myself, and it is my unalterable resolution to place you with them."</p> 
               <p>Alina wept, entreated, finally raved, but he listened to her with an expression of calm sadness which proved how little he was moved. At length she stopped, exhausted and frightened at the little effect she produced.</p> 
               <p>On the silence that ensued, his voice suddenly rang out with a deep cadence that startled her.</p> 
               <p>"Alina, I saw what made you ill. That man was coming hither, and in pursuit of you. Speak the truth-was it not so, and have you not heard from him since you became my wife?"</p> 
               <p>"By what right do you question me thus? I can receive a letter from an old friend without accounting to you for it, if the law does make you my master."</p> 
               <p>"Aye-from a friend, but not from a lover. In that character De Vere has written to you-in that character he was seeking you, and I demand that letter."</p> 
               <p>"You may take my life-you may tear the heart from my body-sooner than I will grant your demand. But since you drive me to desperation, I will tell you that he <emph>was</emph> coming to me-that I would have gone with him, and shared his fate either for good or for evil."</p> 
               <p>He looked at her pallid face, her gleaming eyes, and shuddered. She had wrought herself to a pitch of excitement that rendered her utterly reckless of consequences. She rapidly went on:</p> 
               <p>"Our marriage was informal: it shall not bind me to misery, for I do not acknowledge its validity."</p> 
               <p>"It is too late now to dispute the validity of the tie that binds us to each other. A fatal, fatal presentiment warned me in the first hour of meeting, that De Vere and myself were to come in collision at some future day. I warn you that, if he had carried out his purpose-if he yet seeks to do so-I shall kill him. Yes-the brand of Cain will be placed upon my brow by your hand, and the bitterness of remorse, of baffled wrong, will be yours to bear to your grave. Think of this alternative, and school your rebellious heart to return to the allegiance you owe me as your lawful husband."</p> 
               <p>"You would not dare commit such a wrong! It is incredible-it is shameful, thus to threaten a helpless woman."</p> 
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6349-00000098"/> 
               <p>"I do not threaten you. I only place before you the stern decree of fate itself, if you dare invoke such a punishment upon your head."</p> 
               <p>"And I, who might have been Lady De Vere-who might have shone in the sphere I was born to fill, must give up the man I love, the brilliant fortune he can give me, to become the inmate of a farm-house in this dreary land, because you possess the fatal power to rule my destiny. It is your hour now, but mine will surely come-yes-it will surely come."</p> 
               <p>She stopped, suffocated by the rage and despair that filled her soul. Rudolph said with emotion:</p> 
               <p>"The only hour of peace, of hope, that can ever dawn for you, will be that in which you awake to a true perception of the enormous wickedness you have contemplated; in which you ask pardon of Heaven for your wanderings, and return to the path of honor and fidelity to him to whom you have plighted your faith. I can wait for that hour, in the hope that God has not utterly forsaken you; that His voice will yet be heard in your soul, and show you the right. From my mother's gentle influence, I hope much for you, and to her care I shall consign you till you summon me yourself to your presence."</p> 
               <p>Alina recovered voice to say:</p> 
               <p>"And is it your irrevocable determination to consign me to this living death? Kill me at once, but do not send me to the Glen, for I shall perish there of slow decay."</p> 
               <p>"On the contrary, you will there learn the true uses of life; you will begin to comprehend that it is not given to us to waste in frivolity and self-indulgence. My only hope for you is, that this enforced seclusion will restore you to a sane condition of mind, for I must believe that you are suffering from temporary madness. Weigh well what I have said to you, for I am fearfully in earnest, and what I have declared, I will surely accomplish if the dire necessity arises. To-morrow I must join my regiment; but as there is no immediate prospect of active service, I can procure leave of absence for a few weeks. In ten days I shall return here, and you must be ready to accompany me to the Glen. I will write at once to prepare my mother for your arrival."</p> 
               <p>"So-o-you have issued your ukase, and nothing remains for me, poor helpless wretch that I am, but to obey it. Well, with your sex, 'might is always right,' I know, and since I cannot help myself, I must submit to your tyrannical decree. But you will gain nothing by it; I will close my ears and my heart to all the stupid twaddle of your mother, for she shall never make me such an old Joan as she is. There! you need not look so wrathful and so white. I <emph>will not</emph> listen to her; I will not make an effort to love you and I will yet carry out my plans. Now you know the ground you stand on, so let me alone. I am tired and worn out with all this excitement."</p> 
               <p>She turned her face upon the pillow, and pressed it down to shut out his reply, but Rudolph did not attempt to make any. He only looked sorrowfully and compassionately upon her, and turned to the table to write a few lines to his mother, in which he merely stated that his unsettled life rendered it expedient to place his wife under the care of his parents for a brief season; and it was his intention to bring her to the Glen without delay. He said nothing of the bitter sorrow and disappointment which darkened his life. It would be time enough to make this known to his mother when it could no longer be concealed from her. She would suffer enough from this knowledge, let it come when and how it might.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning, Rudolph left Georgetown, and no sooner was he gone, than Alina issued from her<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6349-00000099"/> apartment, and resumed the life she had hitherto led. If this was to be her last glimpse of freedom, she would use it to the utmost, she cared not what gossips might say; and she rode daily with an escort of young officers, went to picnics, and danced every evening with a gay party of young people, who were as thoughtless as herself, and bent only on gleaning amusement from the passing hour.</p> 
               <p>The days passed all too quickly away, and at the end of the appointed time, Rudolph arrived, and informed her that his arrangements were made for removing her at once to the Glen. He had been ordered to Yorktown, and from that point it would be easy to cross over into Maryland, and gain his father's house.</p> 
               <p>Again Alina remonstrated, and passionately refused to go, but he quietly proceeded to have everything prepared for her departure, and on the morning he had named they set out for Virginia. At the last she did not dare to resist him, though she had every disposition to do so, for she saw that gentle and tender as Rudolph had proved himself to be, there was in him an iron strength of purpose that would not be baffled when he felt himself in the right.</p> 
               <p>He treated her with punctilious politeness; showed every care for her comfort in the fatiguing journey they were compelled to make, but he no longer played the part of the lover to her. He made no effort to win upon the affections which, to him, were a sealed fountain, and made her feel in her turn that if a re-union between them was possible, he must be propitiated.</p> 
               <p>Alina now bitterly regretted the imprudent avowals she had made to him in a moment of passion. But for this insight into her heart, her influence over him would have been unabated, and she could at least have remained where the stir and bustle of active life would give some variety to her existence. How could she live in that dreary country place, with no excitement, no admiration; for the last had become as the very breath of life to her.</p> 
               <p>When she reached Yorktown, she was so much indisposed that a few days repose were necessary before proceeding upon their journey. The celebrated siege which virtually closed the Revolutionary War was commencing, and Alina saw there the great and glorious Father of his Country, surrounded by officers of his staff, when he daily visited the works that were in progress, infusing new energy into those who labored for so great a cause. Her sympathies were not with it, though she was unhappily the wife of an American officer, but even she could not look upon the noble and thoughtful face of the great chieftain without feeling that God had created him for a grand mission which, in time, he would successfully accomplish.</p> 
               <p>On the fourth morning after their arrival at Yorktown they resumed their journey, and with an escort of troopers crossed over to a point on Chesapeake Bay from which a sloop was engaged to take them to Havre de Grace.</p> 
               <p>The vessel was in the offing awaiting their arrival, and to the surprise of Rudolph, in the skipper he recognized Captain Jake Jenkins himself. If he had had any doubts as to his identity, they would have been set at rest by the buxom figure of Betsy Ann seated upon the deck, busily engaged preparing vegetables for cooking. In spite of the war, business seemed to have prospered with the pair, for the sloop they now commanded was larger and of stronger make than the schooner on which Rudolph had taken his first voyage.</p> 
               <p>He offered his hand to the captain as an old acquaintance, and, grasping it in return, Jenkins looked searchingly at him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Well, stranger, you clean take the shine out'n me, for I don' know you no more'n the man in the moon, though the cut o' your gib does look mighty familiar."</p> 
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6349-00000100"/> 
               <p>"It is now many years, Captain, since we met. In that time I have become a man, though I was a well-grown youth then. I fancy Mrs. Betsy Ann will remember me better than you do."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! you know the name o' that wonderful woman of mine? Then you must be somebody as has traveled with me; an' the lady, too, looks as if she knowed something of us. Ah! I 'member <emph>her</emph> face now, 'caze one don't often see sich a picture o' beauty. I'm blessed ef 'taint the young gal that fell in the bay, and the Britisher had to leave you to fish her out. An' you, with your fine officer close, ar' old Rudolph's boy. I've hearn tell o' you, youngster, an I know that you've done good service to the right side. Come here, Mrs. Betsy Ann Jenkins, an' welcome some old friends of ourn to our craft."</p> 
               <p>At this summons Mrs. Jenkins leisurely arose and approached the new passengers.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I declar', now ef this isn't what I always said would happen. You've married the young gal, and sent the red-coat to the right about. I told Jenkins 'twould end so, but he would insist that she would go with the Britisher at the last."</p> 
               <p>Alina, at these words, hastily dropped her veil to conceal the flush that arose to her face, and Rudolph briefly said:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, madam, this lady is now my wife, and we are on our way to my father's. Make her as comfortable as possible, and I shall owe you many thanks."</p> 
               <p>"That I'll do with all my heart, because she had sense to know the true metal from the false. Come with me, Mrs. Rudolph, an' I'll give you a nicer cabin than you had before when we had sich a time bringin' you round when you was half drownded."</p> 
               <p>Alina silently followed her, and after the sloop had set out on her voyage, the captain sought Rudolph, who had placed himself at the stern, his mind filled with the memories of that day which had been the starting point in his career. He thought of all his hopes, his struggles to attain distinction, that he might be worthy to clasp the false hand which had brought him humiliation and misery, and his open brow grew so clouded, his lips closed so sternly, that Jenkins marvelled what had so changed the bright and hopeful youth from whom he had parted in the first bloom of life. After surveying him in silence several moments, he bluntly said:</p> 
               <p>"For a man that claims such a pretty piece of dry-goods as that ar' yonder, you seem mightily cast down, Major. I reckin' you 're beginnin' to find out what I 've made up my mind to long ago; that the femin<emph>ine</emph> gets ahead of the masky<emph>line</emph> in this game o' mattermony. I'm an an old stager, <emph>I</emph> am, an' I advise you jest to make the best o' matters, an' keep the peace on any terms."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph laughed at the quaintness of this speech, yet he shrank from the shrewd observation of the man, and he quickly said:</p> 
               <p>"If, as you insinuate, Mrs. Jenkins rules you, she must do it to your advantage, for you seem to have prospered since we last met."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I reckin as times goes, we 've done pretty well. We 've had some misfortins, but on the whole, we've come out winners. We 've done some good sarvice to the continentals, an' when the old eagle spreads her wings over the land, an' all that rests under our flag is free, ole Jake Jenkins can throw up his hat an' say he's done his share to help on the cause."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph warmly grasped the hand of the speaker.</p> 
               <p>"It is a proud boast to make that our feeble efforts have all been given to ensure the independence of our noble father-land. The end must soon come, and we shall win<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6349-00000101"/> the reward for which we have so long struggled. Peace, with its blessings, approaches, commerce will revive, and with this wide continent as our heritage, we shall go on conquering, and to conquer, till the light of civilization spreads from ocean to ocean."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Major, that is a fine speech, an' you kin talk as well as fight. I 've hearn tell o' your wild charges at the head o' your troop, an' ole Rudolph of the Glen is proud, with mighty good cause, of his dashing dragoon son. I'm glad to take you an' your pretty wife back to the ole homestead, an' I hope you'll be able to do what <emph>I</emph> never could, rule your own craft, whether it's landward or seaward."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you-I shall certainly do that," and Rudolph turned away to seek the cabin, and see how Alina fared. The skipper looked after him, and shook his head, as he muttered-</p> 
               <p>"Well, ef you find that an easy job with that mettlesome critter, you're a notch above me, that's all. She'll have her own way, jest as sure as Betsy Ann allers gits hern, by hook or by crook."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph found Alina lying down, and giddy from the motion of the vessel, for a stiff breeze was blowing, before which they were running at a rapid rate.</p> 
               <p>Their voyage was without incident, and they were landed safely at Havre de Grace, where they found Rupert awaiting their arrival with horses for their accommodation. He warmly greeted his brother, and his wife, assuring them that their arrival was eagerly looked for at the Glen.</p> 
               <p>"And how is my dear old mother?" asked Rudolph. "It seems an age since I last saw her."</p> 
               <p>A cloud passed over Rupert's face, as he replied-"I'm sorry to say she's far from well. The wear and tear of all these years of fighting have told on her very severely. Both of us have been in the strife; I, as I could be spared from home, you all the time; and our mother is one to feel trouble deeply, though she makes very little fuss about it."</p> 
               <p>"I trust that nothing serious is the matter. It would mar the happiness of my visit to find my mother really ill."</p> 
               <p>"I did not mean to say that she is really ailing; but she is greatly changed, and she begins to weary of this long war. You will find her as tender and loving as ever, and your visit will be as a cordial to her. Doubly welcome will it be thus accompanied, for we have always looked forward to your union with Alina as the crowning event of your life. You labored for her as long as Jacob of old did for his wife; but I trust your reward will be better than his was."</p> 
               <p>Alina laughed sarcastically, and said-"I believe the old Hebrew was forced to take the wrong wife after all. Your comparison may be more apropos than you think, though in this case the position of the parties is reversed. In our day, events often force women to do that which both reason and feeling condemn, when time for reflection is given. Alas for them it is then too late to remedy the false step which gives them over, bound victims, to a fate they can neither avert, nor bear with the stoic's patience."</p> 
               <p>Rupert listened to this speech in bewildered surprise. He glanced at his brother, and saw the sudden paleness that crept over his bronzed face, and a glimpse of the truth dawned on him, though how or why he had married Alina without the tie of mutual love he could not comprehend. He made no reply, but busied himself with the preparations for their departure.</p> 
               <p>Soon they were on their way to the Glen, and with a heart that sank with every advancing step, Alina rode forward in silence, while the two brothers kept up a desultory conversation on affairs connected with their home in which she took no interest. Rupert did not venture to allude to the evident estrangement between the newly wedded pair,<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6349-00000102"/> for he saw that in the face of his brother which told him how little happiness this long-sought union had brought him, and he felt the deepest sympathy for his disappointment.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE WIFE AND THE MOTHER.</head> 
               <p>NIGHT had fallen before they reached the Glen, but a bright moon afforded sufficient light to guide them, and they rode leisurely forward in the soft summer air. Fireflies flitted before them, and the deep melodious monotone that fills the forest with insect music in a Southern clime was the only audible sound.</p> 
               <p>At length they drew near the dell in which the house was built, saw lights gleaming through the shadow of the trees, and heard voices mingled with the deep baying of the watch dog, aroused at the sound of their arrival. To Rudolph, this was to have been the proudest and happiest moment of his life; to bring Alina to his parents as the wife of his choice had been his one dream. It was realized, and his heart beat with painful fears, his brow paled with bitter emotion, as the moment of meeting drew near. How she would act, what her conduct might reveal in that first hour he could not tell, and for his mother, he dreaded the shock that awaited her.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Rudolph, with flowing hair, now blanched to silver whiteness, stood in the doorway, into which the flood of moonlight poured. He had changed greatly, and now looked like a man approaching the verge of existence. His wife was on the greensward in front of the house, and on her pale face and whitened hair the eyes of her son first fell. He was greatly shocked, for he saw what those who were daily with her had not observed, that the impress of speedy decay was on every line of her noble face. Her form had lost its roundness, and her thin hands trembled with emotion as she clasped them in thankful prayer that the hope and darling of her life had come to her at last, bringing with him the reward of his noble deeds. In voiceless emotion she clasped her son to her heart, and after weeping a few tears of happiness upon his manly breast, turned to greet her new daughter.</p> 
               <p>This was a moment of painful solicitude to Rudolph: but Alina seemed touched by the change in her old friend, and had the grace to refrain from wounding her in the first moment of meeting. She received her caresses with a slight show of emotion, and together they all entered the house. A table spread with snowy linen, and loaded with every delicacy their means enabled them to afford, stood in the centre of the large room, and in a few moments they had all gathered around it. Mr. Rudolph bowed his head reverently, uttered a thanksgiving for the blessings that still remained to them, and invoked a blessing on the wanderer who was once more gathered in the fold of family love. He prayed also for the new child he had brought them, and asked that the two whom fate had linked together might walk hand in hand to their final rest in love and trust toward each other.</p> 
               <p>Alas! he was soon to learn that neither existed in this ill-omened marriage; but now, all Rudolph's efforts were bent on concealing his unhappiness in this first hour of reunion. The supper passed off in such conversation as naturally arises among the members of a family reunited after a long interval of time. The old man told of the raids upon his property, how he had suffered from them, and the efforts he had made to retrieve his losses; and Rudolph related some of the most stirring events of his soldier-life.</p> 
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6349-00000103"/> 
               <p>The mother said little; to gaze upon her son, and drink in every sound of his beloved voice, as he sat before her, well and strong, after all the dangers he had encountered, was happiness enough for her, and her eyes only left his face to wander to that of Alina, whose pale and subdued expression she accounted for by the fatigue she had lately undergone. At length, Mrs. Rudolph arose, and said:</p> 
               <p>"It is time for Alina to retire, for she seems utterly tired out. Come with me, my love, to your old room. I have carefully prepared it for you."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-she had better go to rest," said Rudolph, glancing toward his wife. "I have so much to say to my father and brother that we shall talk many hours yet."</p> 
               <p>"Do not hurry yourself on my account," replied Alina, indifferently, and the mother threw a startled glance upon her face; but she cast the momentary fear away, and taking up a light, led the way to the little room, with its homely carpet, and rustic furniture. It had been made gay with flowers, and everything was fresh and sweet as spring itself.</p> 
               <p>Alina recalled the last hours she had spent in that room, and with a shudder thought of those that were to come. How should she exist in this dreary exile, severed from everything she had learned to value in the gay and dissipated life she had led since she had inhabited it? Mrs. Rudolph looked on her clouded face, and she softly said:</p> 
               <p>"My child, you are more beautiful than ever. No wonder my boy clung to you through all; he adores you, Alina, and I trust that you will be happy together."</p> 
               <p>A scornful smile flitted over the listener's face, and she bitterly replied:</p> 
               <p>"You will soon see how much he loves me. A man who slights his wife's prayers, and condemns her to such an exile as this will be to me, has very little regard for anything save his own whims."</p> 
                
               <p>At these words Mrs. Rudolph struggled for breath, and placed her hand suddenly over her heart. The room seemed reeling before her, the earth sinking beneath her feet, and her eyes fastened themselves with a stony glare upon the unfeeling speaker.</p> 
               <p>Alina was alarmed at her condition, and would have called out for assistance; but she raised her hand deprecatingly, and the two sat regarding each other in silence, till the elder lady recovered herself sufficiently to say:</p> 
               <p>"It is but a spasm of the heart to which I am often subject of late. I believe I shall yet die in one of them; but I am prepared to go when my Maker calls me; and oh, my child, I could have wished that the summons had come before I heard such words as just now fell from your lips! What can they augur, Alina? I cannot believe that my noble boy, who has so long loved you, would causelessly trample upon you, or abuse the power over your fate which you gave him in bestowing your hand upon him."</p> 
               <p>"He <emph>has</emph> abused it. He has forced me hither; he will leave me here, to learn my lesson of obedience in a retirement that is odious to me. Does a man who loves his wife part from her in the first months of their union, when he could as well keep her near himself? Michael does this, and I wish that I had died before I ever saw him!"</p> 
               <p>"Why, then, did you marry him?" asked the bewildered mother. "Surely, after so long a time, you must have known your own mind."</p> 
               <p>"Alas! I did know it all too well; but I was driven on by a blind fate which has sealed my wretchedness. Go to your son, Mrs. Rudolph: ask him for the sad story of our wedded <emph>bliss,</emph> and let him tell you that our union is a failure, so far as happiness to either of us is concerned. There-I will say no more; pray leave me alone, for I am weary-weary in mind and body-weary of life itself."</p> 
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6349-00000104"/> 
               <p>Alina threw herself upon the bed, covered her face, and left the trembling mother to seek such information as she could gain from her son. Mrs. Rudolph feared to probe a wound which had already so deeply corroded, and she turned away in dismay at this unlooked for revelation, and left the room without uttering another word.</p> 
               <p>Her husband and sons were pacing to and fro in front of the house, talking earnestly together, and she sat down just within the shelter of the door, absorbed in painful thought. Her fears had then proved true, and the Astrologer's predictions were thus far verified. The Life Curse had taken up her abode beneath her roof, there to work her spells of evil against the hope of her heart. That her son was in the wrong she could not believe, and what dire necessity had driven him to the course of action which Alina so bitterly resented? She must know before she slept, for her whole soul was in a tumult of fear for the future, and regret for the irrevocable past.</p> 
               <p>Why had Rudolph urged on this marriage without the assurance that Alina loved him? He must have been bitterly deceived, for no son of hers would have clasped the hand of any woman as his bride without the belief that her heart was in the contract she was forming. All her old mistrust of Alina returned, and she felt that through her treachery this evil had been consummated.</p> 
               <p>Thus wearily scanning the past, and endeavoring to find some clue to the future, Mrs. Rudolph sat till at length her husband said:</p> 
               <p>"Well, lads, it grows late, and to-morrow's work must be done. We had better get to rest, and be ready for its duties."</p> 
               <p>The three entered the house, and after greeting his mother, Rudolph would have passed on, but she held his hand firmly pressed in hers, and said:</p> 
                
               <p>"I must talk with you, my son, before I sleep. Your father and brother have monopolised you long enough, now they must leave you to me awhile."</p> 
               <p>"'Tis the mother's right," said Mr. Rudolph. "Come, Rupert, let the lad have his gossip without any listeners."</p> 
               <p>Rupert cast a keen glance upon the two as he retired; he would have given much to be able to hear what would be spoken between them, but he felt that his presence would be a restraint upon the communion between the long parted mother and son, and he went to his own room with an undefined feeling that their new inmate would add little to the happiness of their humble home.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph sat down beside his mother, and taking her thin hand in both his own, pressed it tenderly.</p> 
               <p>"It seems like old times, mother, to sit once more beneath the dear roof-tree, and hear your sweet voice speaking to me as in the days of my boyhood. Those tones have often come to me even amid the din of battle as the sweetest music of my life."</p> 
               <p>"The sweetest, lad? I thought another voice had charmed you more than mine, for it sang the song of love."</p> 
               <p>Her eyes were fixed earnestly upon him, and she saw the sudden change in his face. He muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Aye-the song of the syren, that lures to destruction."</p> 
               <p>He caught the expression of his mother's eye, and asked, with rapid vehemence:</p> 
               <p>"Why do you look at me thus, mother? Your eyes are brimming over with tears, and there is an expression of painful supplication in them that asks-I know not what."</p> 
               <p>"It asks your confidence, my son. You cannot deceive me. I read your face, and I know that a wounded heart lies in your bosom. Tell me the secret of this alienation between yourself and your wife in the first months of your union?"</p> 
               <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6349-00000105"/> 
               <p>Rudolph pressed her hand so strongly that she was ready to cry out with pain, and after a struggle with himself, said:</p> 
               <p>"Alina has then betrayed something to you. Your own observation, keen as it is, could have discovered nothing from my manner, for I carefully guarded it, that I might save you as long as possible from the knowledge of our un-happiness."</p> 
               <p>"Alas! then it is true that your flower of life has withered in your grasp. Oh, my poor boy, this is a cruel blow-a cruel blow--"</p> 
               <p>"But I trust it will not prove a fatal one, mother. Do not take hope from me, for without it, I shall lose all courage-all interest in life. Since Alina leaves me no alternative, I must tell you all, that you may judge what chances remain of winning her back to be what I once hoped she would be to me."</p> 
               <p>"I listen with my whole heart, my son, and my assistance shall not be wanting in the good work you hope to accomplish. But it is a weary task to win back an alienated heart."</p> 
               <p>"I know it; I feel it in its bitterness, but now there is no other hope left to me. My wife has deceived and outraged me, but in spite of all, I feel tenderly toward her yet. I would save her from evil, and awake the slumbering good that must be in every soul created by the Master of life. I could not watch over her myself, and I have brought her to you, hoping that your tender heart and noble nature will, in time, act on hers, and bring forth such sweet and womanly qualities as must exist in that form of unrivalled beauty."</p> 
               <p>His mother sighed heavily, for she had no such faith in the nature confided to her charge; she felt that Rudolph was fascinated by the external loveliness of the object of his choice, and deluded himself with the belief that it was the type of mental excellence yet to be unfolded; but she said nothing to dash his hopes; they were all that remained to him now, so let him cherish them. She said:</p> 
               <p>"Give me a history of your marriage. Conceal nothing from me, for between you and your wife I have a delicate and difficult part to play."</p> 
               <p>With rapid utterance, Rudolph related the whole story as Alina had told it to him; his mother listened appalled, and when he paused, she breathlessly asked:</p> 
               <p>"She <emph>told</emph> you that she loved another? That she would break her marriage vow to fly with him? Alas! this reckless hardihood in error is the worst feature of all."</p> 
               <p>"No, mother-on that very candor-that very freedom from hypocrisy, I build my hopes of our ultimate reunion. Alina did wrong to give me her hand while her heart was in possession of another, but she could not make her life a lie. She had courage to speak the truth, and on that can I base my renewed confidence in her, when she returns to her allegiance to me. She is now forever separated from De Vere, and in time, my forbearance, my continued affection must touch her heart. Be very gentle with her, mother, and her wayward and capricious temper will soften beneath your tender influence. Aid me to win back my darling, and we shall yet be a happy and united pair."</p> 
               <p>"God grant it, my son: I will dedicate the remnant of my life to this holy purpose, and all that a mother's heart can accomplish, shall be done by me."</p> 
               <p>"And you must, you shall succeed. But why speak thus of yourself, mother? You shall live many years to witness my happiness; the war must now speedily come to a close, and I shall return unscathed, as heretofore, to make a home for myself, in which Alina shall reside, and you will often be our cherished guest."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rudolph held up her thin hand, and faintly smiled.</p> 
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6349-00000106"/> 
               <p>"My time on earth is short; I have long felt this, my son; but I am resigned to the will of the All-Father. The frequent alarms I have endured-the wearing anxiety for those I love, has produced disease of the heart, which may, at any moment, prove fatal. It is right to tell you this, that the shock of my sudden death may not come too severely upon you."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mother, darling, precious mother, do not-do not speak of leaving us. We cannot give you up in the very meridian of our days. You are not old-there is vital strength in your frame yet, to resist this insidious disease, and something must be done for you."</p> 
               <p>There was such passionate sorrow in his tones that she was deeply touched. She calmly said:</p> 
               <p>"Quiet your fears, Michael, for I am in no immediate danger; and if quieter times come, if no sudden shock reaches me, I may last a long time yet. Medicine cannot benefit me; therefore I have not asked the advice of a physician."</p> 
               <p>"What do you suffer from, mother?"</p> 
               <p>"Only a giddy feeling of exhaustion, and at moments a sensation as if the earth is sinking away beneath my feet. But now I shall be better. Your visit has acted on me as a renovating cordial, and the task you have delegated to me will give new interest to my life. I will do all that is possible to restore Alina to her true self, and make her sensible of her responsibility to a higher power for the acts done in this life. There is where the true foundation is lacking, I fear, and without that there is no hope of abiding excellence."</p> 
               <p>"Only make her like yourself, my sweet mother, and you will twice have given me life. I trust all to you. But I am keeping you up too late. Rest in peace and hope; do not let this confidence drive from you the repose you so much need."</p> 
                
               <p>He kissed her, and led her to the door of her room, then returned to pace up and down the yard the greater portion of the night in spite of the fatigue of the previous day. Toward dawn, he threw himself upon a wide, old-fashioned sofa which stood in the family room, and fell into a heavy sleep, which lasted till the noise of the servant setting the table for the morning meal aroused him.</p> 
               <p>He arose, went into Alina's room, and found her still sleeping. He looked down on her with infinite love and compassion in his eyes, with the painful doubt struggling in his mind that, after all, the confident hopes he had expressed to his mother might never be realized. Probably disturbed by the magnetic power of his glance, she moved restlessly in her sleep and muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Go away-leave me-leave me. You are fatal to me, and I not less so to you."</p> 
               <p>The words were uttered faintly, and at intervals, but they were quite distinct, and his heart sank within him, for they seemed to him, in his state of wretched excitement, the very utterances of Fate itself. Rudolph turned away sick at heart, and wandered toward the sheltered walk in which he had so often loitered with Alina, bearing within his boyish heart the charmed belief that they were as much formed for each other as the first pair that came from the divine hand. The difference between now and then was too great; his strong soul was wrung with agony, and he precipitately turned from the well-known path, and walked he knew not, cared not whither, till the voice of his brother arrested him.</p> 
               <p>"Where to now, Michael? Looking over the old place? but it seems to me you don't see anything before you, for you came near walking over me."</p> 
               <p>"I believe I was too much absorbed in thought to observe where I was wandering. It must be near the breakfast hour. Shall we return to the house?"</p> 
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6349-00000107"/> 
               <p>"Aye, as soon as I have put up these bars. This is late for our morning meal, but mother thought your lady wife would be tired and indisposed to rise early, so she ordered it an hour later than usual."</p> 
               <p>"Alina never gets up to breakfast, so my mother need not put herself out of her usual way on her account. She has adopted the English fashion of taking only tea and toast at that meal, and that can be prepared for her at any time."</p> 
               <p>"Really-a nice farmer's wife she'll make, upon my word. You mean to be a farmer, I believe, when all this fighting is over?"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so-I cannot say. Fate may fix me in a city, and on some accounts, perhaps that will be best."</p> 
               <p>"That means on Alina's account. The country won't suit her, and your plan of life must be altered to conform to her tastes. I'll tell you one thing, Michael, I'd make my own nest in my own way, and give my mate to understand that she must find shelter and happiness there, or nowhere with me."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph flushed deeply.</p> 
               <p>"You are thinking of Alina's imprudent words yesterday evening, and you fancy that we are already at dagger's points. It has not quite come to that yet, Rupert, and as I wish to have happiness in my home, I decline playing the arbitrary part you advise. The nest must be agreeable, or the bird will seek to fly from it, perhaps."</p> 
               <p>His brother looked keenly at him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"If <emph>that</emph> is your fear, it would be wisest perhaps to--Yet no-I will not say that, my dear Michael, for I know how fondly your heart has been set on this bewitching creature. Alina is certainly as lovely as a dream, but I am afraid she will not seek to make you happy in your own way. She feels her power, and she will abuse it-it's a woman's nature, I believe."</p> 
                
               <p>"That is a strange sentiment to fall from the lips of our mother's son, Rupert; for a truer, or better woman never lived."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-but who is like <emph>our</emph> mother? If I could find another as good as she is, I'd marry her the minute she'd say yes; but I never expect to, and therefore I'm booked for an old bachelor."</p> 
               <p>"Don't despair too soon. I appreciate my mother as highly as you can, and I have brought my wife to her to be trained by her hand."</p> 
               <p>Rupert suppressed the whistle that arose to his lips, and, after a pause, said:</p> 
               <p>"I hope she may succeed, that's all. So now, old fellow, let's in to breakfast, for I am half famished."</p> 
               <p>The family met at the morning repast, and Rudolph saw by the searching light of day that his mother was more wan and emaciated than he had believed it possible for one of her former robust appearance. At intervals, there was a fluttering color upon her cheek, and her eyes glittered with a light that was evidently the offspring of disease; but she smiled upon him with all her old sweetness, and insensibly his wounded heart was soothed by the consciousness that to one human being, at least, he was dear and precious as her very life.</p> 
               <p>Late in the day, Alina's breakfast was prepared and taken in to her, much to the disgust of her father-in-law, for Mr. Rudolph was an industrious and hard-working man, and he had little toleration for what he considered fine lady airs. For Michael's sake he repressed the expression of his dissatisfaction, but he wondered if Alina intended to be a burden to his failing wife in their narrow household. They could afford to keep but one servant, and that was an elderly negress who had lived with them for many years. Chloe's best working-days were over, and already too much<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6349-00000108"/> devolved upon the mistress of the family. The losses they had suffered had curtailed their means, and if this dainty young lady remained with them she must at least learn to wait upon herself, and keep the same hours as were kept by the rest of the family.</p> 
               <p>A few minutes before the early dinner was served Alina made her appearance, looking languid and depressed. She scarcely touched the food that was placed before her, and seemed indifferent to the impression she might produce. Mr. Rudolph observed her closely, and toward the close of the meal bluntly said:</p> 
               <p>"I don't wonder you can't eat, daughter, when you've taken your breakfast only an hour ago. But I must say that I never saw a young bride look as downcast as you do. Cheer up, child, for Michael will come back safe and sound, as he always has done. The same Providence is over him now that has hitherto protected him so wonderfully."</p> 
               <p>Alina raised her eyes defiantly, and the wicked thought arose in her heart that if she could regain her freedom even by the death of her husband in the battle's strife, she would scarcely weep over his untimely fate. She repressed the reply that struggled to her lips, and coldly said:</p> 
               <p>"I have few fears for Major Rudolph. He can protect himself, as he has heretofore done. I am not well to-day, so you will excuse my depression."</p> 
               <p>She arose abruptly and walked out of the house.</p> 
               <p>The old man looked at his son, but he affected to be busily engaged with his dinner, and no comment was made on the strange conduct of Alina.</p> 
               <p>When Mr. Rudolph found himself alone with his wife, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Our son is a young eagle, who has mated with a paroquet. Alina thinks that fine feathers make fine birds, and in her heart she despises us and our ways. It will be a bitter lesson to her to learn to accommodate herself to them. The lad had better take her away with him when he goes, for she will only be a care and a worry to you."</p> 
               <p>"My dear, old man, don't talk in this way, for Michael would be deeply hurt if he thought his wife is not welcome beneath his father's roof. Alina must remain with us for a season, and I hope to be of some use to her in teaching her such lessons of life as a motherless girl has had little chance to learn. Be patient with her, and you will soon return to your old fondness for her."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I don't deny that I loved the pretty creature that came to us in her desolation for help and comfort; but this stuck-up young woman is no more like her than a flaunting hollyhock is like a sweet moss-rosebud. She don't really care for Michael, or she would make an effort to appear well to his family."</p> 
               <p>"Their engagement lasted many years," replied Mrs. Rudolph, evasively; "and why should she have fulfilled it, if not from love?"</p> 
               <p>"Aye, why should she, indeed? She's uncommonly pretty, and has been spoiled, perhaps. In that case the lad was right to bring her to you, for if any mortal can bring her round gently, you can do it, Serena. Your god-mother gave you the most fitting of names, my dear wife, for you have calmed many a tempest for me, and you may prevent future ones for our boy, by taming this skittish young creature, and teaching her the true duties of life."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, dear; your praise is always sweet to me. I will do the best I can, and the result we must leave to a higher power."</p> 
               <p>"But you must not take too much on yourself. I'll not have you overtasking yourself to minister to her dainty notions."</p> 
               <p>"Leave all that to me; only do not interfere between<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6349-00000109"/> Alina and myself, and she will soon fall into her place quite naturally. The sweet child that left us years ago will come back to nestle near our hearts, and make our lonely home more cheerful than it has lately been. There-trust to me, old man, and all will be well. Say nothing to Michael, for he would be hurt if he thought his wife is not as welcome to you as he himself is."</p> 
               <p>"She's welcome enough for that matter, but I only wish he could stay to look after her himself. After he goes away, she'll be moping herself to death, and if the news of a battle comes without hearing that he is safe, between you, I shall have a time of it. Well-well-patience, and things will come round right."</p> 
               <p>In trouble, this was the usual mode of consolation adopted by Mr. Rudolph, and his wife made her invariable reply to his closing remark:</p> 
               <p>"Yes-patience can bear all, conquer all," and their conference closed.</p> 
               <p>That evening Rudolph left for Havre de Grace. Before setting out, he held a long conversation with Alina, in which he placed before her their exact position, and entreated her by all their hopes of happiness to yield to the influence of his mother; to cultivate the sweet and gentle graces which rendered her so dear to her family; and, above all, to think of him as ready to fly to her side when she summoned him there as her faithful and tender protector throughout life.</p> 
               <p>Alina listened with a bitter and stubborn feeling of perverseness; she gave him no pledge, no hope for the future; and when he finally parted from her, she passively received the kisses he pressed upon her brow and lips. At the last moment she averted her eyes from him, and he went forth almost despairing as to the result of this seclusion from which he had hoped so much.</p> 
                
               <p>The parting between mother and son was deeply affecting; she said everything that could reassure him in this hour of bitter trial, and he blessed her for the spring of comfort she opened to his parched and thirsting soul. Like water in the desert, it gave new life to his fainting spirit, and he went on his way calmed and strengthened for whatever might lay before him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE SERPENT ON THE PATH.</head> 
               <p>IN the months that slowly followed the departure of Rudolph, his mother often had cause to despond over the task she had undertaken. Alina passed her days in listless vacancy, taking no interest in anything that went on around her, and often betraying bitter disgust for the homely details of life among people of straitened means, who literally earned their bread by the sweat of the brow.</p> 
               <p>The example of daily sacrifice-the strong bond of union that existed in this virtuous family, had no charm, no significance to her. She loathed the monotony of their existence and pined for the excitements which had become a necessary aliment to her being. Her feelings, in place of softening toward her husband, became more bitterly resentful at the probation imposed on her. What right had he, she asked, to tear her from all that was desirable to her, and immure her in this living tomb, to drag out her youth in repining and discontent?</p> 
               <p>Her thoughts turned to De Vere and the widely different fate he could have given her, and she watched with intense solicitude for some token that she was still unforgotten. In<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6349-00000110"/> France his exchange could more easily be effected than if he had been brought to America, for from there he could appeal to powerful friends to aid in freeing him, and she confidently looked forward to seeing him again beside her.</p> 
               <p>Yet time passed on, and he came not. Months slowly rolled away, and she heard nothing from him. The cold conviction settled upon her heart that he had given her up, and after a wild paroxysm of weeping and despair she calmed herself, and examined her actual position. Since it was impossible to attain the brilliant position for which she was ready to sacrifice all that is dear to her sex, she must make the best of that which her evil fate had assigned her. She could not much longer endure the life she was leading, and her only avenue of escape from it was through the renewed confidence of Rudolph. She must regain her power over him, and to do this, it was necessary to play the part of the reformed and devoted wife.</p> 
               <p>She would begin by a change of conduct toward his family, and gradually she seemed to awaken to a perception of the duties she had so long and systematically neglected. The heart of the fond mother was cheered by evidences of returning interest in the common cares of life; Alina became almost tender and thoughtful for her; she began quietly to aid her in many little ways; to talk with her cheerfully of the future, and even to refer to the return of Rudolph as an event to be desired by her, and express contrition for the coldness with which she had treated him. One day she said:</p> 
               <p>"You know all, mother-for I am aware that Michael confided the history of our marriage to you. That is the reason that I have so hardened my heart against you. I thought you were sitting up in judgment upon me, and condemning me for what I know was wrong; but I have been under evil influences since I left you. My uncle's wife gave me no clear perceptions of right, and it is only since I have been thrown under your care-have daily seen you bear the crosses of life with the patience of an angel, that I begin to comprehend what a true woman is. I have been very stubborn, and very hard-hearted, but you have conquered me at last by the force of your own goodness."</p> 
               <p>Alina wore an air of perfect sincerity, and Mrs. Rudolph wept glad tears over her as she pressed her to her bosom, and called her by every endearing name.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my child, this hour repays me for all! I have prayed for you daily, and hourly, and God has deigned to hear and answer my supplications. My poor boy will yet be happy with you; he will love you more dearly than ever."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! I have wounded him so deeply that I fear he can never forgive me. If repentance could win Michael back, I would do all that a woman-a wife may do to accomplish it; but his letters to me are so cold-mere bulletins of the state of his health, and the nature of the service he is engaged in. Once they were filled with passionate protestations of regard; but alas! I have forfeited my right to his love, and I should not complain that it is withdrawn from me."</p> 
               <p>"It is not, Alina. With renewed confidence, the affection of Michael will regain all its strength. You have been the idol of his life, and if you could have heard him speak of the future in connection with yourself, when he told me his sad story, you would know that on you still depends all his hopes of renewed happiness. I do not scruple to tell you this now, for your heart is at last turning to him, and he will prize it as dearly as if it had never known estrangement."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, I have been blind and stupid. Michael is the noblest of men, and, had we never been parted, I should have continued to regard him as such. The one I learned to prefer to him was not his equal; but his worldly advantages<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6349-00000111"/> tages were great, and my ambition and love of admiration led me into the snare which has caused us both such bitter wretchedness. Dear mother, how shall I convince Michael that I have recovered my right reason? that I repent of the past, and will endeavor to make him happy."</p> 
               <p>"Write to him such a letter as your feelings will dictate, Alina. Heal the wounds you have given him, and woo back the love that is legitimately your due. Only convince my son that you are <emph>sincere,</emph> and he will meet you half way, only too happy to be reconciled."</p> 
               <p>Alina pondered on this advice; but, with the subtle tact which distinguished her, she felt that the change must not be too sudden, or Rudolph would mistrust her. He should gradually see the dawning of a better day, and from each succeeding letter gain a new ray of hope in her slowly awakening love. With consummate skill she accomplished this. She also kept a journal in which she recorded her feelings day by day, and suffered this to fall accidentally under the eye of his mother. After a faint show of opposition, she permitted Mrs. Rudolph to read the struggles there recorded-to see the efforts of a benighted soul striving back to the better path from which it had so long departed.</p> 
               <p>Alina had great talent for composition, and much creative power; she could write beautifully of virtue, and sublime sacrifice to right; and on those pages she had lavished all her art, for they were to win back the love that was to place her in the sphere she panted to re-enter.</p> 
               <p>Her letters to Rudolph assumed a warmer tone, and gleams of the sweetness of nature he had once believed her birthright, cheered his solitary pilgrimage as an oasis springing in the arid desert of his life. How dearly they were cherished; how fondly welcomed every generous heart can understand. He replied to them, and their correspondence lost its hard official tone. In time, they wrote like lovers to each other; and the arrival of the journal, surreptitiously sent to him by his mother, completed the reconciliation between them. Alina was once more his own, and he wrote to her:-</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"I only await your summons to come to your side. The great victory we have so long striven for is at last ours; Yorktown has surrendered to the Commander-in-Chief, and it is confidently believed that peace must now soon be declared. But a greater victory is yours, my beloved Alina, in restoring yourself to your true place in my heart. How it has yearned for this hour of renewed confidence I cannot tell, for words are inadequate to express my grateful joy in the prospects that open before me.</p>
                  <p>"My mother has sent me your journal, and from its affecting records I learned to value more highly than ever the regard of such a being as you there prove yourself to have become. The noble nature has asserted itself, and I trust you as implicitly as in the first days of our union. Beloved Alina, I only await your recall to obtain a furlough and fly to your side. Write to me without delay, for I shall prepare everything for a speedy departure when your missive arrives."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Alina read this letter with triumph with which was mingled not one emotion of tenderness toward its writer. She could tolerate him; could play her part naturally, and gracefully enough to satisfy her husband; and she resolved to be more circumspect in her social intercourse. Rudolph's jealous self-respect must not again be wounded by any appearance of levity on her part. The lesson she had learned had at least taught her the necessity of acting toward her admirers with that reticence becoming to her position as a wife.</p> 
               <p>She pondered on all these things, and arranged her<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6349-00000112"/> future course of action. She then joined Mrs. Rudolph with a beaming face, and announced the speedy return of her son. The news soon spread through the house, and every face wore a smiling aspect. Rupert heartily congratulated her, and the old man blessed her fervently. Of late, her changed demeanor had worked upon him, and he was beginning to love her as much as in the days of her early girlhood. He set down much of her waywardness to grief at her separation from her husband, for his wife had been careful not to betray to him the actual position of affairs, and he pardoned her for it on that account.</p> 
               <p>Alina wrote a long and tender letter to Rudolph, entreating him to return as speedily as possible, assuring him that the fatal hallucination which had marred their happiness, had passed away, and she was now truly and devotedly his own. Her words were calculated to reassure the most mistrustful nature, and she well knew that she had to deal with one who was all openness and truth.</p> 
               <p>How rapturously that letter was read-what delicious tears of joy were wept over its pages, can well be imagined. To it his mother had added a few lines confirming his newborn hopes, and urging him to return to the Glen without delay, as a welcome was preparing for him more joyful than that which met the return of the prodigal son when he came back to the home of his father. A brief reply was returned:</p>

Yours, my darling, in tenderness and truth.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>Alina read the letter twice, and a faint, contemptuous smile gleamed upon her lips as she thought how easily he had again become her dupe. Good works from <emph>her!</emph> She wondered how she was to perform them, and if he would really require her to become a saint, in outward seeming at least.</p> 
               <p>Well-even that she would undertake, to bind Rudolph to her again, till her influence was paramount over every other. She carried his letter to his parents, received their kiss of congratulation, and then said:</p> 
               <p>"I am going to the leafy walk to dream of Michael. To-morrow evening he will wander with me there in renewed happiness."</p> 
               <p>She smiled brightly as she passed out of the house, and the old man said to his wife:</p> 
               <p>"I declare she is the prettiest creature under the sun, and I don't wonder the lad is infatuated with her."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-she is very lovely, and I trust she is now as good as she is beautiful."</p> 
               <p>"You have been a saving providence to her, Serena, and Michael may thank you for this happiness."</p> 
               <p>She smiled serenely, and together they watched the receding figure of Alina, unconscious that the serpent was upon her path, and that she was hastening now to throw herself within his very coils.</p> 
               <p>The gnarled trees cast their shadows upon the winding pathway, and the evening sun glinted through the openings between them. In this spot the birds were never molested, and the flutter of their wings, the glad musical chirp with<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6349-00000113"/> which they greeted each other, were the only sounds that broke the stillness of the evening.</p> 
               <p>Alina wandered slowly onward, musing on the new career about to open before her and trying to school her rebellious heart to the task she had set herself. She had gained the farthest extremity of the alley, when she was suddenly startled by something falling at her feet. She looked around, but saw nothing, and after a moment of hesitation, stooped and picked up a roll of twisted paper which bore no address. She rapidly opened it, and became as pale and nearly as cold as marble, as the words traced within met her eyes:</p> 
               <p>"I am here; do not cry out, lest you betray my presence."</p> 
               <p>She had no voice to utter a sound, and with a feeling of utter bewilderment she looked toward a dense thicket of underwood from which the note must have been thrown. She heard the crashing of boughs, saw the figure of a man breaking through them, and the next instant she was clasped, half-fainting, in the arms of De Vere: his eager voice was pouring forth a torrent of passionate joy at their reunion.</p> 
               <p>In that moment, Alina had no thought but for him. To her, Rudolph was as completely annihilated as though he did not exist. The lover who adored her, whose passion she returned, held her to his heart, assured her of his unchanged devotion, and she would fly with him even if death, desolation, despair were left behind her.</p> 
               <p>Her fate now lay in her own hands, and she would mould it to her wishes. She murmured:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Lionel, why-why have you tarried so long? My heart has been almost broken by the fear that you had forgotten me."</p> 
                
               <p>"Then you have not permitted this accursed Rudolph, who gained you by a fraud, to become my rival. You love me yet, Alina?"</p> 
               <p>"Ever-ever-I have even told <emph>him</emph> that I love you. I have entreated him to give me back my freedom, that I might go with you, and as my punishment he banished me to this dreary spot, where I have dreamed only of you, and yearned for your return."</p> 
               <p>"And I, Alina, have suffered the tortures of the Inferno in these long months of enforced absence."</p> 
               <p>He placed her on a rustic seat at the termination of the walk, sat down beside her, and went on:</p> 
               <p>"I have met with many trying adventures since we last parted. The transport that bore me to France was attacked by an Algerine corsair of superior force, taken, and carried into the harbor of Tripoli. I was detained there in bondage till my own government was notified of my situation, and after a thousand difficulties, I was at last liberated. I hastened immediately to England, to obtain the funds necessary to return here and bear you away. I lost no time in setting out; I landed at Baltimore, and with some difficulty made my way hither. Since mid-day I have been in this vicinity watching for your appearance; several times I have approached quite near the house, but the baying of the watch-dog warned me to retire again. I hoped that you would take an evening stroll, and when I saw you coming I concealed myself in yonder covert and scribbled the words I threw at your feet. To-night we must fly together; I will take you to Baltimore, where a priest shall perform the true marriage service for us, and once mine by the rites of the only true church, I defy man to separate us again."</p> 
               <p>"Yes"-replied Alina in a subdued tone-"We must go without delay, for Rudolph returns to-morrow to take me away with him when he leaves again, and this will be<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6349-00000114"/> our only opportunity to secure an uninterrupted flight. Rupert is absent from the farm on business; the old people will suspect nothing, and I can join you at any hour after nine to-night."</p> 
               <p>"I will be here at that time, and watch for you till you come. A quarter of a mile below, my servant waits with our horses, and every arrangement is made to secure a safe and speedy journey. Take nothing with you that you will not absolutely need, as you can procure all you may want in Baltimore. We shall be detained there till a vessel sails, but we are strangers to every one, and there will be little danger of detection. You have no shrinking-no hesitation, Alina? You do not believe yourself legally bound to Rudolph, and in your heart there are no lingering regrets, on his account?"</p> 
               <p>There was one faint pang at the thought of the scathing blow she was about to inflict upon her forsaken husband, but her voice was steady, and her cheek unblanched, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"None; I have no thought but for love and you. I repudiate the tie that was cemented through the treachery of Helen, and give my hand to you with the internal assurance that you are my soul-mate, and the lawful ruler of my destiny."</p> 
               <p>De Vere expressed his thanks with ardor, and after a pause Alina asked:</p> 
               <p>"Have you seen my aunt or cousin since your release? I have not heard from them since we parted."</p> 
               <p>"I called on Mrs. Fitzhugh in London during my brief stay there. She is lodging in the city, and Helen is at a finishing school near her. She spoke kindly of you, though she said that you had never written to her since her return to England."</p> 
               <p>"What had I to say?" asked Alina, bitterly. "Should I have given Helen the triumph of learning that I was miserable in the marriage she had been the cause of my forming? Truly, my pride was too great for that, therefore I remained silent. My life since we saw each other, has been a wretched dream of discontent, and the best thing I could do, was to keep my unhappiness to myself."</p> 
               <p>"And now, I trust, it is forever ended, my beloved. I will give you high station, wealth, adoring affection, and we can easily elude the search of Rudolph if he should be mad enough to attempt to regain you."</p> 
               <p>She grew pale.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! yes-let us keep out of his reach, for he has sworn to kill you if I proved false to him, he is a man to keep his word."</p> 
               <p>De Vere laughed scornfully.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he threw down the gauntlet years ago; but have no fears, Alina, for I shall not be fool enough to take it up. In this wide world there is space enough to avoid any one we do not choose to meet. Rudolph's destiny chains him to this country, ours takes us to England. Should he follow us there, we will go to the continent, and travel till he is weary of seeking us. It will be easy enough to evade him, and I have no idea of ever standing face to face with him. His insolent rivalry will be sufficiently punished when I take you from him."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," she vaguely said. "It will be bitter-bitter. He will hate, will loathe me; but even that is better than his love."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>His love!</emph> Do not speak of it, Alina; never allude to this man again; let him be buried in utter oblivion, for he has long enough been the dark shadow on our path."</p> 
               <p>Alina placed her hand in his, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I will not; from this hour, he is to me as though he had never existed. I think of, dream of, live only for you.<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6349-00000115"/> At half past nine, I will join you on this spot, to leave it forever with all its hateful associations far behind me. I go with an undivided heart, for you are my hope, my trust, my only dependence in the future."</p> 
               <p>He fervently uttered his thanks, and together they sat discussing their plans, and talking over that past till twilight gathered around them. Then Alina tore herself away, and De Vere watched her retreating form as long as it was visible, with the rapturous emotions of a lover on the eve of winning all that was most precious to him in life.</p> 
               <p>He had feared that he should find her changed either in person or in feeling; but he found her more charming than ever; and for the first time when face to face, she had permitted him to look into her heart, and see that it was devoted to himself alone.</p> 
               <p>Carried away by the absorbing passion Alina had inspired in his breast, De Vere was resolute to gain her at all hazards; he believed that Rudolph would scarcely think his false love worth pursuing or contending for; but if he should do so; if he found means to demand satisfaction for his blighted home and crushed affections, he would kill him as coolly as he would shoot down a brigand upon his path.</p> 
               <p>He sat down at last, to collect his thoughts, and rest a little before the night ride that awaited him.</p> 
               <p>Alina found supper on the table, and she took her usual seat in a tumult of thought and feeling which she could not entirely conceal. She scarcely tasted the food that was before her, and Mr. Rudolph laughed, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Joy has taken away your appetite, daughter. Eat, that you may be fresh and rosy when my boy comes back. I wish him to see that we have taken good care of you."</p> 
               <p>"Give me a cup of tea, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma mre,</foreign>" she said, with a strange smile, "for I am too happy to care for any other food."</p> 
                
               <p>She drank the tea, arose quickly, and passed into her own room. The deluded parents looked at each other, and both said:</p> 
               <p>"How much she loves him. How happy he will be;" and in that belief they retired.</p>

               <head type="sub">RUDOLPH'S RECEPTION AT HOME.</head> 
               <p>ON the following morning, breakfast was served at the usual hour, but Alina did not appear. As she had given up her habit of taking that meal in her own apartment, Mrs. Rudolph knocked on her door, and called to her; no answer was returned, and fearing she might be ill, she unclosed the door and looked in.</p> 
               <p>There was no sign of Alina, and to her dismay the bed had evidently not been slept in on the previous night. Her heart gave a wild bound, the room swam before her, but she recovered sufficiently to approach the rustic stand, on which a paper was conspicuously placed. Her eyes fell upon the lines traced on it, and she read, with fluttering breath, the following words:</p>

My cruel position forced on me the deception of which I have been guilty.

               <p>
                  <emph>Gone!</emph> Michael coming in love and trust, to find this envenomed shaft ready to pierce his heart! The shock was more than the fond mother had strength to bear; her eyes failed her; her heart, so long fluttering with feeble power, stopped its beating forever; and Mrs. Rudolph fell lifeless upon the floor.</p> 
               <p>Chloe and her master both heard the fall, and they rushed into the room at the same moment to find her extended upon the carpet, clutching the fatal paper in a death grasp which could not be loosened. They raised her, placed her upon the bed, and used every restorative known to them. Their efforts were vain, for the spirit had already departed; though it was long before her husband could be made to comprehend that it was really so. Stunned and bewildered, Mr. Rudolph could not understand what had really happened, and in piteous accents he kept crying out-</p> 
               <p>"Where is Alina? Why does she not come to help me bring back life to my poor Serena. She is not dead; no-no-she cannot be dead. Don't say such a word, Chloe, for I won't have it," and with trembling hands he bathed the wan face, and tried to bring back circulation to the chilling hands by clasping them between his own.</p> 
               <p>"What is this paper she holds so fast? 'Twas this that killed her. Oh, Holy Father, what can all this mean?"</p> 
               <p>By tearing the paper slightly he succeeded in removing it, and glanced over the lines traced upon it; but his vision was too much impaired to permit him to ascertain its meaning. He looked helplessly around for his glasses, and at that moment the rapid approach of steps was heard, and the joyous voices of the two brothers talking with animation reached the ears of the old man.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph had anticipated the time of his expected arrival, and he was already beneath that blighted roof, where desertion and death awaited him in place of the tender welcome he had expected.</p> 
                
               <p>"Hilloa!" cried Rupert, "here's breakfast untouched and nobody to sit down to it. Where's mother?-where's Alina?"</p> 
               <p>"You are so impatient, Rupert," said Rudolph. "Seek mother, and tell her that I am here, while I go into Alina's room and give her a sweet surprise."</p> 
               <p>He bounded rapidly toward it; but at the entrance of his anticipated Eden, he met the dusky face of Chloe like a warning apparition. She hastily whispered, "Don' go in <emph>thar,</emph> Marse Michael; don', for de sight you'll find thar'll break your heart."</p> 
               <p>He staggered against the wall.</p> 
               <p>"Is Alina ill? What has happened to her?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothin' as I knows on; but she aint in thar, nor no wheres about here, I reckin."</p> 
               <p>He seized the old woman, and shook her violently.</p> 
               <p>"How dare you speak thus of my wife? Not here-where then is she?"</p> 
               <p>"I don' no," gasped Chloe. "She's gone, an' one dats better'n her is gone too; yes-she's gone to God."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph listened, without comprehending her meaning. A deep groan reached his ear, rent from his father's heart by the sound of his voice, and the certainty of the dreadful anguish he came to face.</p> 
               <p>What was going on in that room? Was Alina dying?-dead? Who had gone to God? What could the poor negress mean by her strange words? Rudolph put her aside with a strong hand, strode into the room, and saw the lifeless body of his mother, with his father crouching near it, still holding the paper before his eyes, though no longer attempting to decipher its contents.</p> 
               <p>With a cry of anguish he threw himself forward, grasped the cold hands, and buried his face in the bedclothes. The old man whispered-</p> 
               <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6349-00000117"/> 
               <p>Michael, help me to bring her to. She's only fainted. Come, lad, it's not too late to bring her round yet."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph raised his pallid face, and asked-</p> 
               <p>"How has this happened, and where is my wife, that she is not beside my mother at such a time as this?"</p> 
               <p>His father put his hand to his head in a feeble manner-</p> 
               <p>"I don't know-I cannot understand. Alina wasn't here, she may have gone out to walk. Read this for me, Michael; I found it in your mother's hand, but my poor old eyes can't make it out."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph grasped the paper, glanced over it, and comprehended the dire meaning of the scene before him. Alina had filled the measure of her perfidy, and the shock of its discovery had destroyed his mother.</p> 
               <p>A wild tempest surged within him, but outwardly he was calm; in the presence of death, beside the bereaved old man, he must control himself. He took the hand of his father tenderly in his own, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Let me lead you away, father. My mother has gone to join the angels, and it is well, for she has escaped great misery here."</p> 
               <p>"But what does the paper say, and where is your wife?"</p> 
               <p>"I have no wife," he sternly replied. "She who bore that sacred name is now no more to me than the dead flower broken from its stalk and cast into oblivion. Alina has fled with her lover; the knowledge of this gave a death-blow to my mother. That is what this paper reveals."</p> 
               <p>He spoke with such stony calmness, that Rupert, who had entered the room, and was kneeling beside the death-couch, arose, and took his hand:</p> 
               <p>"My poor Michael, this is too much-too much to bear. When you hoped for everything, she has but lured you back to strike a more deadly blow; but she could not think its recoil would prove fatal to our mother."</p> 
                
               <p>"She cared not if it did. Speak no more of her, Rupert, false as fair, let her float down the turbid tide on which she has chosen to embark. I shall know how to right myself, and punish her."</p> 
               <p>The last words were muttered so low, that Rupert did not understand them.</p> 
               <p>All their care was now given to the bereaved old man, whose grief was most affecting to witness. His wife had been the companion and stay of his life, and this sudden wrenching apart of the tie that bound them together overwhelmed him with sorrow. Rudolph stifled the wild emotions that struggled for mastery over him, to minister to his father; and in the dreary interval that elapsed from the death of Mrs. Rudolph to the day of her burial, he strove to put from him his own blighting sorrow, that he might retain outward composure for the duties that lay before him.</p> 
               <p>All the time he could spare from the old man was passed beside the death couch, and over those hours of anguish a veil must be drawn. The heart alone "knoweth its own bitterness," and over such grief as his, the eye of Omniscience alone should hold its watch. Henceforth he had no tie on earth; his feeble old father must soon sink into the grave treachery had dug for him, and his brother had no more need of him. Their paths had long been separate, and now they must be still more widely severed, for hence-forth he had neither country nor name. That which had been so dishonored he would abjure, and in the character of an avenger seek the world over till he found the author of his humiliation and wretchedness, and exact a fearful penalty for the wrong he had inflicted on him.</p> 
               <p>Friends gathered around them so soon as the tragical incident of the day became known, for Mrs. Rudolph was beloved and respected by all who knew her, and many wept when they saw her consigned to her last repose. But no<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6349-00000118"/> voice dared to speak of consolation to the stern man of marble who bore the head of her coffin to the grave, performing with his own hands this last service of love for her. The hollow sound of the mould as it fell within the aperture, was, to him, the knell of all tender and gentle emotions; till the stern vow he had taken was fulfilled, his life had no other object; and he turned away from that lowly grave as a stranger and an alien in the land of his birth.</p> 
               <p>His story would be blazoned abroad, and those who knew him must learn the burning degradation that had fallen upon him; he could never again endure the companionship of his brother officers; the war was virtually ended, and he would at once resign his commission in the American army, and go upon his dreary quest. Such was Rudolph's final resolution, and he wrote to the commander-in-chief as soon as he arrived at that decision.</p> 
               <p>His father had sunk into a state of apathy which resembled imbecility, and, in his desolation, he turned to the son whose presence was most familiar to him. Rudolph felt that he was not necessary to him, and in spite of his brother's affectionate remonstrances, he steadily made his arrangements to leave the homestead as soon as possible. He relinquished his interest in the farm for a few hundred dollars which had been hoarded by his parents from year to year, and after an affecting parting from his relatives, set out to seek such future fortune as Fate might have in store for him.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph remembered what Alina had said concerning the informality of their marriage, and he concluded that she and De Vere would seek that point where they could most readily find a priest to unite them. In a large town they would be freer from observation than in a village-that town must be a seaport, to afford facilities for embarkation, and he at once came to the conclusion that Baltimore was the place selected. There he might chance to find them yet, and thither he would go without delay.</p> 
               <p>But before bidding adieu forever to his native land, he must once more seek his old friends-Col. Calvert and his daughter. He recalled that last interview with Dora, and bitterly felt how different his fate might have been if he could have returned her love. Destiny had willed otherwise, and now he sought her to bid her, as he believed, an eternal farewell.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph rode rapidly forward till he reached the domain around Calvert Hall; then, checking his steed, he paced leisurely through the well remembered road, endeavoring to calm his mind for the approaching interview. It was a lovely evening, and the bright sun, the odor of the late flowers, recalled that day of welcome on which so gratifying an ovation had been prepared for him on that spot.</p> 
               <p>As he drew near the hall he saw two figures in the summer house, which he at once recognised as those of Colonel Calvert and his daughter. The veteran reclined in a large chair, and Dora sat at his feet, reading aloud to him. The sound of her voice was wafted to Rudolph, and it awoke a thousand tender and bitter memories, that swelled his heart almost to bursting.</p> 
               <p>The tramp of his horse aroused the reader, and she raised her head with a half startled expression which rapidly changed to one of surprise and joyful welcome.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, father, here comes our old friend, Major Rudolph! But he seems sadly changed; even at the distance he is from us, I can see his mournful air and stern expression. What can have happened to him?"</p> 
               <p>"My child, I forgot to tell you that I have heard of his mother's death. She died very suddenly, I believe; and there are also some strange rumors about his wife. Be very careful how you allude to her."</p> 
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6349-00000119"/> 
               <p>His <emph>wife!</emph> the word could bring a pang to Dora even yet, and in her heart she said:</p> 
               <p>"I thought so; such a woman as Alina Derval could never make a true man happy."</p> 
               <p>By this time Rudolph had thrown himself from his horse, and was rapidly approaching the summer-house. Dora arose, advanced a few paces to meet him, and offered him her hand with the frankness of former days. Her clear eyes looked into his, and he saw there only the friendly expression of a sister. She said:</p> 
               <p>"Welcome, after your long absence. We have hoped you would not again visit the Glen without seeking your oldest and best friends."</p> 
               <p>He pressed her hand to his lips, but could, at that instant, make no other reply, for his long repressed emotions threatened to master him in the presence of those who, he knew, would so deeply sympathize with him. He passed rapidly on, to take the outstretched hand of Colonel Calvert, whose infirmities prevented him from rising, for his failing health had now settled in confirmed paralysis of the lower limbs. He said, with emotion:</p> 
               <p>"My brave boy, I am happy that you have sought us once more. How much I have yearned to see you, to talk over with you your gallant exploits, I will not say. We have followed you throughout your career with deep interest, and it has been a proud thought to me, that I first saw and appreciated your talents for the profession in which you have gained such merited distinction."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, dear and valued friend; your praise is grateful to me, and I need something just now to sweeten the bitter draught of life. I have come to bid you adieu before leaving my native land forever; a few more weeks, and those who have known me will know me no more, for I shall be as one dead to them."</p> 
                
               <p>"The listeners looked at each other in appalled silence. What could have happened to bring him to such a decision as this? They looked on his set features, and saw that he was fearfully in earnest. Colonel Calvert pressed his hand, and said:</p> 
               <p>"This must not be, Rudolph, for your country still needs you. Such a man as you are cannot be dispensed with just now."</p> 
               <p>"Peace must now soon be declared; I have performed the measure of my service to the land of my birth, and circumstances have arisen which render further continuance here distasteful to me. I shall seek another sphere, and-and, God alone can see what my future lot is to be."</p> 
               <p>"But you will lose the reward of all you have done. Your services entitle you to brilliant distinction, and, with your talents, in the new order of things that must arise, you can play an important part. Speak not of going from us, I conjure you, as you value your own fame."</p> 
               <p>"I value nothing now," he gloomily replied. "The more lofty the height to which I might aspire, the more blighting would be the stain that is upon me. No-I must seek a new path-leave behind me every association with the bitter past; even the name I have borne will sound no longer in the ears of men, for it is my fixed purpose to abjure it forever."</p> 
               <p>Col. Calvert grasped his hand, and tears streamed over his worn face as he looked into that of the speaker, and read there the evidences of the tornado that had passed over him, uprooting in its path all that was dear and precious to him. After a long and painful pause, he said:</p> 
               <p>"This resolution must have a terrible cause. A man does not lightly relinquish the fruits of years of toil and struggle."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-a terrible cause you may well say. I stand<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6349-00000120"/> before you blighted in my manhood-cast down from the height I have striven to gain by the hand of her I trusted. You will hear the story, but not from my lips. I cannot speak of her, nor of her treachery; I can only feel it in every throb of my heart, in every quivering nerve of my frame!"</p> 
               <p>He bent down his stately head, and the first tears he had shed since that fatal morning came to his eyes. He sternly dashed them away, and stood before them the image of grief too deep for words to console, and they felt that the iron had indeed "entered into his soul." Dora timidly approached him, and softly said:</p> 
               <p>"My friend, my brother, you are respected by all men. You have done great deeds, let not this bitter sorrow unfit you for the duties of life. Your home is here; no taint can cling to you through the perfidy of another. Listen to the voice of friendship, and abjure this wild plan."</p> 
               <p>"Oh Dora-Dora!" passionately replied Rudolph, "had we only met before this baleful woman crossed my path, I should have been saved from this degradation; but a cruel spell was upon me, from which I could not escape. I delivered myself over to the Delilah who has shorn me of all that is dear to man, and in my desolation I come to ask of you and your father that kind remembrance-those prayers, which the blighted wanderer will sadly need. Ask me not to stay in this land, for here is death to my pride-disgrace to the unsullied name I inherited from my father."</p> 
               <p>He uttered this outburst in a voice of such thrilling anguish, that Dora had no words to reply. After a long silence, Col. Calvert said:</p> 
               <p>"Your resolution is then irrevocable?"</p> 
               <p>"As irrevocable as the decree of Fate itself," was the stern reply. "All that can be said to dissuade me from my purpose has already been uttered, and without effect. I have parted from my poor old father, from my only brother, for the last time, but I could not go away forever without looking once more upon the true friends I have made for myself. It was due to Dora, and yourself, that I should express to you all the gratitude I feel for your past kindness, and I have made my last pilgrimage to this spot, to clasp hands with you before I depart upon my lonely way. I will spend the night beneath your roof, but with the dawn I must depart."</p> 
               <p>"And when you have found a new abiding place, will you not also furnish us with a clue to your future fate? We shall watch with solicitude for anything that can throw a light on your career."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph seemed plunged in gloomy thought; after a few moments, he said:</p> 
               <p>"If the cloud that now encompasses me ever again breaks into light, I will send you a token that it is so. If you hear nothing from me, conclude that my life has set in darkness and storm. Such is most probably its ultimate destiny."</p> 
               <p>"Then we will hope for a better day for you. Such souls as yours were not created for a common destiny, and God takes care of his own. You will make Fate itself bend before you, and yet win the recognition due to a great and highly endowed soul."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Dora, fervently, "I feel that it will be so."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you, my dear friends, and trust that your kind prophecies may meet fulfilment; but it will be a long and bitter struggle before I can again feel that the prizes of life are worth contending for."</p> 
               <p>If anything could have consoled Rudolph in his present state of wretchedness, the tender words of these valued friends would have acted as balm to his wounds; but he was not yet in a state to be soothed into peace. He had but one<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6349-00000121"/> burning desire; to meet the author of his sufferings as man to man, and mete out to him the reward of his villainy. That once accomplished, he could turn his perturbed thoughts to new purposes in life; though he now believed that for him hope had sung her last syren song, and the triumphs he might win could never bring happiness to his wrung and tortured soul.</p> 
               <p>The three sat together till a late hour of the night, and with the dawn Rudolph departed; but he gave no hint to Colonel Calvert that he was in pursuit of De Vere. After the first painful outburst of feeling, he alluded no more to Alina; and his friends hoped, what they wished to believe, that he would permit her to go unmolested upon the disgraceful path she had chosen.</p>

               <p>DE VERE and Alina reached Baltimore in safety on the third day after their departure from the Glen. He was well acquainted with the town, and easily obtained lodgings in a retired street, with a widow who had apartments to let. His first care was to find a priest who would be accommodating enough to perform the service he wished, without making too strict inquiries into the antecedents of the pair he was to unite.</p> 
               <p>There was a small Catholic chapel in the environs of the city, under the care of a priest who was known to profess the strictest tenets of the faith to which he belonged. He regarded the baptisms and marriages performed by the clergy of the dissenting churches as absolutely null and void, and unhesitatingly proclaimed his uncompromising belief that out of the pale of the one and indivisible church there is no salvation-no authority to bind or loose.</p> 
               <p>To him De Vere went, and procured the service he required. The bans were published in this out-of-the-way place on three consecutive days, and on the evening of the third De Vere and Alina stood before the little altar and ratified their vows. To him it was a moment of intense happiness; to her one of triumph and joy. She cast from her all thoughts of the forsaken Rudolph, and revelled in the anticipation of the brilliant future about to open before her.</p> 
               <p>So soon as they could obtain passage for England they intended to embark, but in such uncertain times there was much difficulty in speedily doing this; especially as De Vere would not leave until he could find a vessel whose captain could give him a private cabin into which no other person was to intrude. In addition to this, exposure to the cool night air on the night of her flight, and, perhaps, some faint feeling of remorse for the misery she must have left behind her, threw Alina into a low fever, which hung around her from day to day to day, threatening to deprive her of strength to endure a sea voyage at that stormy season of the year.</p> 
               <p>De Vere watched over her with the utmost solicitude, and anxious as he was to get away, he suffered no token of impatience to escape him. He thought Alina more adorable than ever, and felt that he would have risked death a thousand times sooner than have missed the happiness their union afforded him. To him she was gentle and confiding, and she endeavored in every act of her life to show him how truly she was devoted to him.</p> 
               <p>De Vere took every precaution against discovery, and he never went out without a disguise that must have baffled<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6349-00000122"/> his most intimate friend. He wrote to New York to have his letters forwarded to him under cover to the priest, and one day he received quite a bulky package from him, which had been sent from England by Mrs. Fitzhugh. It contained a few lines from that lady addressed to himself, in which she conjured him not to seek Alina as he valued her happiness, though she had sent to him important documents for her, which she requested him to find means to forward to her without delay.</p> 
               <p>With a curling lip Alina read the affectionate advice her aunt addressed to herself, with which was mingled details concerning her own affairs and those of Helen. For these she cared very little, but the last page afforded matter of much deeper interest.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh went on to say:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"Your uncle, Count Armand Derval, is dead, and after ignoring your existence throughout his life, he has actually named you as heiress to all the property he left behind him. It is not a brilliant fortune, for Count Derval derived his chief means of living from the place he held at court; but to you and Rudolph it will be a handsome independence when its value is transferred to the land in which your destiny is fixed. I congratulate you, my dear niece, on this bequest, as it will enable you to aid your noble husband in rising to the position such a man should fill. The documents forwarded to me from France are in my possession, but I send you duplicates of them, that you may see the extent and nature of your new possessions. I believe that a voyage to Europe will be necessary to enable your husband to claim your fortune, and I trust you will be his companion, and thus we may once more meet."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>While Alina read these lines, De Vere was employed in examining the papers, and he laughed as he looked up and said:</p> 
               <p>"This is not so bad a windfall, Alina. Your uncle has bequeathed you a hundred and fifty thousand francs, securely invested; and all you have to do will be to prove your identity, and take possession of your inheritance. There will be no difficulty in that, but it involves a change in our plans. There is a vessel here loading with tobacco for Havre: I was on board of her yesterday, and was half tempted to engage a neat cabin then; but my desire to go directly to England prevented me from doing so. Now it seems necessary to visit France first; what do you say to going on her? do you think you are strong enough to venture on the voyage?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, I am much better, and the news seems to have given me new life. Engage our passage by all means, and let us leave as soon as possible. We have already been too long detained here, and at times, I have fearful misgivings for your safety. It seems to me that our happiness is too great to last, and I dread a meeting between you and--"</p> 
               <p>She did not dare to pronounce the name that trembled on her lips.</p> 
               <p>"Dear love," he tenderly replied, "do not conjure up phantoms with which to scare yourself. The man you fear will not seek us out. He knows that your heart is utterly alienated from him: that you could never be induced to return to him; then, wherefore should he attempt to follow us? He belongs to a utilitarian people, who do not profess to cultivate the code of chivalry; and he has not sprung from that class which seeks atonement for injury in blood. In spite of his former bravado, I feel quite safe, I assure you."</p> 
               <p>Alina felt this to be a false estimate of Rudolph's character, but she was willing to have her fears allayed, and she<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6349-00000123"/> listened to his words with the faint hope that they might prove true.</p> 
               <p>To get away from America, to seek a new and wider sphere, was the strongest wish of her soul, and she rallied all her strength for the effort necessary to a speedy departure. A maid was found for her in the person of the widow of an Irish soldier, who was anxious to return to Europe, and De Vere engaged the cabin on the Walrus in the name of Captain Lyon, as he intended to preserve his incognito till he was landed on a foreign soil.</p> 
               <p>He learned from the captain that the principal portion of the cargo was owned by a gentleman who intended to go out with him as supercargo. He spoke of Mr. Michel as a singular and reserved man, who seldom spoke except on business; a small cabin built on deck was to be appropriated to his use; and as Captain Lyon and his wife desired complete privacy, there was little danger of this unsocial being attempting to interfere with them in any way.</p> 
               <p>No other passengers were to be received, and as the ship was staunch and well built, besides being an excellent sailer, they might anticipate a speedy and prosperous voyge. De Vere expressed his hope that it might prove so, as his wife was not strong enough to bear a prolonged or boisterous trip across the Atlantic; and mutually pleased with each other, the two parted.</p> 
               <p>The season was unusually warm; the tropical storms were over, and although it was now late in December, they hoped for pleasant weather while on shipboard. With a feeling of light hearted gaiety, in which she had hitherto scarcely dared to indulge, Alina made her final preparation for departure, hoping that they were escaping from the danger into the very jaws of which they were ignorantly thrusting themselves.</p> 
               <p>Could she have dreamed who that silent and dejected supercargo really was, how would she have recoiled from the thought of crossing his path. On his arrival in Baltimore, Rudolph laid aside his uniform, and donned a garb suited to the position he had now assumed. He diligently sought for De Vere throughout the city, and more than once they had met upon the streets, without any suspicion on the part of either that his most deadly foe was passing before him. The change which the lapse of time had made in Rudolph accounted for this, and the disguise of De Vere was too well sustained to be penetrated. He had also permitted his beard to grow, and changed his voice as perfectly as his garments concealed his identity.</p> 
               <p>After weeks of vigilant search, believing his quest hopeless, Rudolph concluded that his enemy had already embarked for England, and as an opportunity offered itself to increase his slender means by embarking in a speculation in tobacco, he invested nearly the whole of his capital in that article. He dropped his last name, and one letter from his baptismal one, and as Mr. Michel, assumed the office of supercargo on board the Walrus.</p> 
               <p>He was too wretched and restless to form any settled plans for the future; after placing his business in good train in Havre, it was his fixed purpose to go in search of Sir Lionel De Vere, and pursue him, if he fled before him, even to the uttermost parts of the earth. His vengeance accomplished, he would then seek military employment under some foreign power, for he knew that all his talent lay in that line, and he must win fame upon the battle field, or die without distinction.</p> 
               <p>Twilight had fallen when the new passengers came on board, and took possession of their cabin. At dawn the vessel was to sail, and the supercargo did not intend to embark until the last moment. Alina was soon established in her new quarters, and everything that could contribute to<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6349-00000124"/> the comfort of the voyage was lavishly provided by De Vere. They were to have their meals served in their own cabin by their servants; and as the man who attended on De Vere was perfectly prudent and trustworthy, the travelers felt as if they had at last gained a haven of safety.</p> 
               <p>With the dawn of day the preparations for departure reached their ears, and soon the motion of the ship assured them that they had forever left the land from which they so ardently desired to escape. It was a joyful moment, and they congratulated each other with lively pleasure that present danger was avoided, and the means of evading future ones in their possession.</p> 
               <p>The ship gained the sea, and for several days both De Vere and his companion suffered much from illness, but this passed away, and Alina declared herself benefitted by the transient sickness. Her spirits revived with every mile they gained, and she was soon well enough to resume her usual occupations. De Vere read aloud to her; he devoted himself entirely to her, and each passing hour seemed to strengthen the bond that bound them together. Alina taught herself to believe that it was indestructible, and De Vere had no misgivings on the subject.</p> 
               <p>Possessing no strong religious faith, he was fully imbued with the most ultra dogmas of the church in which he had been educated, and he looked upon Alina as legally his own. Such vengeance as Rudolph might seek to gain would surely not take the form of a prosecution for bigamy against <emph>her,</emph> and for everything else he believed himself prepared.</p> 
               <p>That the avenger was upon his very steps, breathing the same air he breathed, he never once dreamed, or his feeling of security would have been sadly damped.</p> 
               <p>During the early part of the vogage the weather had proved cold and squally, and there was no temptation to venture on deck, though De Vere occasionally promenaded there for exercise.</p> 
                
               <p>On these occasions he had remarked a figure muffled in an immense pea jacket crouching in the bow of the ship, with his hat drawn over his brows, and an expression of listless dejection in his whole figure which betrayed a history of wretchedness and disgust of life, but De Vere instinctively avoided him. He did not possess sufficient benevolence to interest himself in a forlorn stranger, and he contented himself with speculating on the causes of his evident depression, inwardly contrasting his own fate with that of this unhappy man, and congratulating himself that he had gained all that he believed necessary to his perfect happiness.</p> 
               <p>The Walrus at length entered the Gulf stream; the atmosphere changed, and the soft airs of the tropics superceded the chilling breezes that had hitherto wafted them onward. Under their influence Alina revived, and her cheek bloomed with renewed health. She would not be persuaded to venture on deck by daylight, but at night she consented to go up a few moments to watch the effect of the full moon, rising as if from the ocean.</p> 
               <p>Well wrapped up, with a thick veil shrouding her features, she walked for half an hour, speaking in low tones to her companion. But on this occasion, and on several others, the figure of the dejected man of whom De Vere had spoken was not visible. He was in his own cabin, writing, as they imperfectly saw as they passed his window. The bent figure, dimly outlined, with his hat slouched over his brow, revealed nothing to Alina, though a cold thrill pervaded her frame as she passed his door. On the last evening she shivered so perceptibly, that De Vere hurried her below lest she should take cold.</p> 
               <p>Alina did not again go on deck for many nights-a feeling of dread for which she could not account had taken possession of her, but at length they drew near the coast<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6349-00000125"/> of France, and the captain announced that in twenty-four hours they would be in the port of Havre. His passengers heard it with delight, and that evening Alina proposed to promenade once more on deck before they reached their destination.</p> 
               <p>"It is chilly," De Vere said, "and you had better wrap yourself up more warmly than the last time."</p> 
               <p>She drew out the heavy shawl she had worn from the Glen, and a peculiar odor was diffused through the cabin. De Vere commented on it, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I never smelled on any other a perfume like that you use-I believe I will christen it <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bouquet D' Alina.</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>"And with good cause," she replied, with a laugh; "for it is of my own composition. I have a luxurious fondness for sweet odors, and I compound this myself by mixing several extracts together. Thus I have an original perfume which no one can imitate."</p> 
               <p>"It is delicious; the Sultan would give you the finest diamond in his collection for the secret of its preparation. The Turks, you know, are connoisseurs in such things."</p> 
               <p>On what trifling things fate often hangs, was never more perfectly illustrated than in this accidental choice of a shawl saturated with the subtle and peculiar odor which she alone knew how to prepare.</p> 
               <p>They ascended to the deck, secure and happy, to meet their Fate upon their way. In his usual place crouched the dark form of the melancholy supercargo, and as the two silently flitted past him, he started, clutched a coil of rope that lay beside him, and seemed panting for breath.</p> 
               <p>The odor so familiar to him in the brief days of his happiness; which he had so often and so delightedly inhaled; which was so indelibly associated with his false love, was wafted toward him as she passed. He stifled the cry that arose to his lips, quelled the rapid pulsation of his heart, and eagerly watched for her return.</p> 
                
               <p>Why had he not at once recognised the carriage of that queenly head?-the footfall, that once was sweetest music to his heart? for now, with his senses all alive, Rudolph knew that he could not be mistaken. Alina was before him, and the mysterious passengers who had so constantly secluded themselves, were Sir Lionel De Vere and his own guilty wife.</p> 
               <p>He suffered them to pass and repass without interruption, for he was deciding in his own mind the surest plan to carrry out his vengeance. Fate had given his foe into his own hands, and now he should never evade him. Their account must be settled before land was reached, and one or the other, perhaps both, fall in the combat he intended to seek.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph did not move till the two retired below; he knew that De Vere would again return, for of late he always walked the deck till ten o'clock, and now it was scarcely eight. He arose as they disappeared, staggered forward, and, after a few moments, went steadily toward the captain's state-room. He found him examining a chart, and he looked up with an expression of startled surprise as his eyes fell on the pale face and flashing eyes of the strange supercargo. "Is anything the matter, Mr. Michel? you look very ill and wild."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph steadied his voice, and replied</p> 
               <p>"I am not at all ill; but I have been startled by a strange apparition. Who are those people that you have on board? Under what name do they travel?"</p> 
               <p>"Under their own, I presume. There is no mystery about them that I know of. Captain Lyon is returning to Europe with his wife; she has been ill, and he devotes all his time to her. A more attached couple I never saw, and she is one of the prettiest creatures I ever looked on."</p> 
               <p>"Yet she is the wife of another man, from whom she has eloped. I saw her on deck to-night and I knew her."</p> 
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6349-00000126"/> 
               <p>"You seem strangely moved, sir; but granting this to be true, what interest have we in it? The husband must right himself."</p> 
               <p>"Such is his intention, and I am he."</p> 
               <p>Captain Weston stared at him as if he thought him mad. He asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who then are you? and by what chance have these people thrown themselves into the very lion's jaws?"</p> 
               <p>"You see before you one who has abjured name, home, country; an outcast from hope, from love, from all the sweet charities of life, has that man made me. <emph>Why</emph> fate threw us together is clear to me; that I may avenge my outraged honor in the only way now left to me. Sit down, Captain Weston, and listen to my story, for this night you must be my witness that the duel I am about to engage in was conducted fairly."</p> 
               <p>In silent bewilderment the captain obeyed, moved as much by curiosity to penetrate the reserve of his unhappy passenger as by interest in the parties concerned. In few, but graphic and burning words, Rudolph placed him in possession of the facts, and appealed to him to decide if any other course was left to him but to challenge De Vere at once, and settle without delay the difficulty between them. After a long pause, he reluctantly said:</p> 
               <p>"It was a wretched chance that brought you both together here. Who would think that lovely woman could be such a double-dyed deceiver? Yet it makes my heart ache to think of the poor thing, if you should kill her lover. It will break her heart."</p> 
               <p>"She has no heart to break," was the stern response. "She has given death to my mother, wretchedness to me, and now I will repay her as she merits. All I ask of you is, to see fair play between that man and myself. If I fall, bury my body in the sea, and take what I have as a reward for the service. If he falls, let her do with him as she sees fit; to me she is henceforth nothing."</p> 
               <p>The captain would have remonstrated, but Rudolph would not listen to him. He said:</p> 
               <p>"My cabin is large enough for such a combat as this will be, and I can light it up sufficiently for my purpose. I have my pistols with me; you shall load and examine them yourself, for you must act as second to both of us."</p> 
               <p>With firm tread he led the way to his cabin, followed by the startled captain, who would have given much to see his way clearly out of the affair; but Rudolph's energy and determination bore all before it. He produced the pistols, lighted the lamps, and removed the few articles of furniture to one side. It was a long narrow room, but far short of the space usually placed between combatants in a duel. Captain Weston said:</p> 
               <p>"If you are both marksmen, in this narrow space it will be a double murder. Neither will have a chance to escape."</p> 
               <p>"It matters not. In affairs of this nature, men often fight with only the width of a table between them. I waive that: Sir Lionel De Vere may have such chance for his life as the length of this room affords him. But, if there is justice in Heaven or on earth, I shall surely kill him."</p> 
               <p>"Then it is your fixed purpose to take his life?"</p> 
               <p>"Assuredly-or to give my own. The earth is not wide enough to hold me and the man who has so basely injured me. Draw the load, and prepare the pistols for a new charge, while I seek my enemy."</p> 
               <p>He went out, closing the door behind himself, and the captain proceeded most reluctantly to perform the duty assigned him. He could think of no means of preventing this deadly rencounter; and, in truth, his own sympathies were with the wronged husband to whose story he had so lately listened. He was a man of nerve, but his hands<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6349-00000127"/> trembled as they took up the weapons so soon to deal death from their dark tubes.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE DUEL AND ITS RESULTS.</head> 
               <p>THE night was clear, and starlit, though low in the horizon a few faint clouds were gathering, heralds of a coming storm, which the Walrus might chance to evade by getting into port before it burst.</p> 
               <p>As Rudolph anticipated, De Vere had returned to resume his walk, and the sound of his steps smote upon the ear of the enemy before his eyes became sufficiently accustomed to the faint light to discern his figure. Suddenly they ceased, and Rudolph paused a moment to ascertain his exact position before approaching him. Pressing his hand over his eyes to steady his vision, when he again looked forth he saw the dark outline of De Vere's form leaning over the bulwark, apparently watching the flashing waves through which the ship cut her rapid way.</p> 
               <p>As the panther leaps on its prey, Rudolph bounded forward, touched him upon the arm, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Sir Lionel De Vere, I wish to have a few words with you in private. Come with me, if you please."</p> 
               <p>The shock of hearing his name called, deprived De Vere, for an instant, of all self-command; but he quickly recovered himself, and haughtily said:</p> 
               <p>"I have no business with you, sir, and my name is Lyon."</p> 
               <p>"Liar! wretch! scoundrel! you shall not evade me thus!" was hissed through the teeth of the enraged man who addressed him. "Come with me this instant, and render the account due for all your baseness, or I will strike you down before me."</p> 
               <p>The appalling truth had not yet dawned on De Vere; he thought Rudolph a madman, and believed it best to humor his fantasy; therefore he replied:</p> 
               <p>"Whither shall I go? Can we not as well settle this matter here?"</p> 
               <p>"No, not here-not alone, and in darkness, lest others should say the survivor had dealt unfairly in the combat to which I challenge you."</p> 
               <p>"But, my good sir, I have no cause of quarrel with you. What hallucination leads you to seek me out as an object of vengeance?"</p> 
               <p>"Hallucination do you call it? Know that against <emph>me</emph> you have committed the deadliest wrong that one man can be guilty of toward another, and I demand the only atonement known to the code of honor-your life."</p> 
               <p>A cold dew broke out on the brow of the listener, and he hoarsely asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who then are you?"</p> 
               <p>"I am Michael Rudolph."</p> 
               <p>The words rang out over the darkened waters with fearful distinctness, and for an instant De Vere shuddered through every nerve of his frame; but he was not a coward, and instantly recovering his self-possession, he replied:</p> 
               <p>"I know not what perverse fate has thus brought us together, but if you insist that I shall fight you for taking under my protection a woman who has never loved you, I will not refuse. Let us settle this affair without delay."</p> 
               <p>"Such is my intention; follow me."</p> 
               <p>"Let me go down for my pistols."</p> 
               <p>"There is no need that you shall do that. Captain Weston, who will be our witness, is preparing mine for our<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6349-00000128"/> use. If you decline using them, he can send your servant for yours; but you comprehend that perfect secresy is best for the affair we have in hand."</p> 
               <p>"It matters not to me," De Vere indifferently replied. "I am master of the weapon, and I shall certainly kill you."</p> 
               <p>"And I as certainly believe that God has given your life into <emph>my</emph> hands, as an atonement for the bitter wrong you have done me."</p> 
               <p>He strode away, followed by De Vere, who by this time had recovered from the shock of his sudden revelation, and was as eager for the combat as Rudolph could be. He fully intended to rid himself of him forever, and then Alina would be surely his. He believed the fury and agitation of his adversary would render his hand too unsteady seriously to endanger his own life, and he felt assured that the firmness of his nerves would give him the victory.</p> 
               <p>They entered the lighted cabin, and with a sneering smile, De Vere beheld the preparations which had been made for his reception. Captain Weston would again have remonstrated, but neither party would listen to him. De Vere waved his hand, and said:</p> 
               <p>"It is useless, Captain. This gentleman and myself are of one mind; the feud between us must come to this arbitration, and it is as well settled here as elsewhere."</p> 
               <p>He then took the captain aside, and whispered to him a few directions with reference to her whom the event of the next few minutes might leave without a protector. Weston promised all that was required of him, and after examining the pistols, De Vere carelessly said:</p> 
               <p>"They are such as I usually use. Let us finish this scene as speedily as may be."</p> 
               <p>"I am ready," replied Rudolph, with stern composure, and the two were placed by Captain Weston in the centre of the cabin, from which they were to pace toward the extremities of the narrow limits assigned them, wheel, and fire simultaneously.</p> 
               <p>The low wail of the rising wind, the dash of the sullen waves as the ship rushed onward, mingled with the solemn tread of these men-one, or both of whom, was doomed to destruction within the next moment of time.</p> 
               <p>They reached the boundary-the fatal word was given-and in the same instant both pistols were discharged. There was a faint cry, a heavy fall, and when the smoke cleared away, the captain wiped from his eyes the blinding mist which had gathered in them, and looked to see the result.</p> 
               <p>De Vere lay upon the floor, his upturned face fixed in the immobility of death, and Rudolph leaned against the wall with his hand pressed over his left side, as if staunching the flow of blood from a wound.</p> 
               <p>"It is all over with him, poor fellow," said the captain, pointing to the recumbent form. "How is it with you, comrade?"</p> 
               <p>"I am wounded, but not severely. He aimed at my heart-but He who knew my cause was just, protected me. I felt that it must end thus."</p> 
               <p>He took off his coat, bared his side, and exposed a flesh wound: the ball had merely grazed the skin, and passing through his clothing, was found buried in the wall beyond.</p> 
               <p>"God be praised that one escaped, for I thought you both surely doomed to destruction."</p> 
               <p>"I was certain that his life was given to me. Yet I care very little for that which has been spared to me. All that I valued <emph>he</emph> wrested from me, and I have repaid him. One more duty remains to me-I must once more see the woman who has been the cause of this, and with my own lips tell her what I have done."</p> 
               <p>In vain the captain combatted this resolution. In that<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6349-00000129"/> hour of relentless feeling Rudolph would not forego his purpose.</p> 
               <p>They raised De Vere's body, and examined it, to be sure that life was extinct. A small stream of blood issued from a wound in his breast, and they saw that the bullet had penetrated his heart, causing instant death. Already his limbs were stiffening into marble rigidity, and on his features the vindictive purpose with which he had accepted the combat was stamped with vivid power.</p> 
               <p>They wrapped him in the cloak he had thrown aside, and placed his stark form upon the berth. The captain dressed Rudolph's wound, and resuming his coat, he said:</p> 
               <p>"And now the last act of the tragedy approaches. I must once more stand face to face with the evil genius of my life, and return to her lips the dregs of the cup she has prepared for me. It is just, and I will not forego my vengeance on the false heart that has made me an outcast and a murderer."</p> 
               <p>"Spare her this," entreated the captain. "She is a woman:-she loved him, and she will surely suffer enough when she knows all."</p> 
               <p>"A woman! well, yes-she is a daughter of the sphinx, and as hard as the granite of which her mother is made: otherwise she could never have been guilty of what she has done. She has ambition, pride and self-love, but no gentle or true humanity. She shall feel the event of this hour in every pulse of her being, and mine alone shall be the voice to announce it to her. Stay here and watch, I ask you, until I can send De Vere's servant to relieve you. I shall not be long gone, for such a mission as mine is soon accomplished."</p> 
               <p>He went out, closed the door carefully behind him, and threaded his way toward the staircase that led to Alina's cabin. He descended lightly, tapped upon the door, and without waiting for a reply, opened it and entered.</p> 
                
               <p>Alina was alone, and she sat with her back to the door, gazing through the window with apprehension on the increasing evidences of storm, which was now rapidly rising. Without turning her head, she said:</p> 
               <p>"You have stayed very long, dearest. I am afraid we are going to have dreadful weather. I would not undress when I saw the storm rising, but sent Betty to bed, and sat up for you."</p> 
               <p>No answer came, and she arose, dropped the shawl that enveloped her form, and turned toward him with some light words of endearment upon her lips. Rudolph had advanced to the centre of the cabin, and the glare from a swinging lamp fell full upon his bared head and pale features. Had the fabulous Gorgon appeared before her, she could not have seemed more suddenly frozen into stone than she appeared to be at this unexpected apparition. She stood rooted to the spot, motionless, voiceless, with lips half apart, and eyes staring as if some spirit from the regions of the dead had been suddenly evoked before her.</p> 
               <p>The sound of Rudolph's voice broke the benumbing spell.</p> 
               <p>"Alina, I am here, and my very presence in this cabin, should tell you all. The doom I have foretold has fallen upon me. The stain of blood is upon me, and <emph>you</emph> have placed it there."</p> 
               <p>She sprang toward him, clutched his arm fiercely, and in low, husky tones, whispered:</p> 
               <p>"You have not dared? You have not killed him? No, no-you could not-could not be so cruel in your vengeance."</p> 
               <p>"Cruel? Do you think that any feeling of humanity is left in my outraged heart? Yes-De Vere lies cold, and stark-insensible to your love, to your blandishments; and mine was the hand that gave him his doom. I swore to<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6349-00000130"/> take his life, and thus I have avenged the destruction of my mother-the desertion of my wife. Who shall judge me? Not you, fallen and degraded one; not you, false and perjured woman; for on your soul lies the sin and misery of this wretched hour."</p> 
               <p>"Then De Vere is dead," said Alina, in the same monotonous whisper. "Dead!-dead!-<emph>dead!</emph> Now hear <emph>me,</emph> Michael Rudolph," and her voice rose suddenly to a piercing cry-" I loved him alone; I loathed your very presence, even in the first days of our marriage, when I forced myself to put on the semblance of affection. I but wedded you to escape dependence on those who cared little for me, for I thought myself deserted by my true love. This I told you long ago; I begged for a release from the vows I rashly plighted, but you refused it, under the plea of duty. When I was forced to dwell in the obscure and humble home of your parents, I again deceived you into believing that my heart had turned toward you; but it was only to escape from the dreary life I led; and almost in the hour I succeeded, my lover came to me, offering me a brilliant future; love, happiness, and also the station of a wife-for the tie that bound me to you he did not recognize as valid, for it was unsanctioned by the only true church. I fled with him; I married him. Aye, <emph>married him;</emph> and you have followed me up-have wrested from me all that I value in existence; and I swear to pursue you to the last hour of your life. I will become the curse of your life."</p> 
               <p>She sank back, exhausted, despairing, but still tearless; for the anguish struggling in her heart was too deep for the relief of tears.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph sternly replied:</p> 
               <p>"You cannot curse my life more deeply than you already have done, but it shall not always be thus. I loathe, and shrink from you as much as I once loved you; I have wiped out the disgrace you put upon me, and in a new country, under another name, I will seek and find that distinction and happiness of which you have deprived me in my own. Farewell forever, Alina; in this hour we part for the last time."</p> 
               <p>"Not so," she passionately rejoined. "I will find you-will strike you again, and again, till I, in my turn, shall accomplish my vengeance. I swear undying enmity to you. Guard yourself as you may, conceal yourself under a false name, and I will still track you as the sleuth hound find its prey. Go-leave me to my woe, for you have stricken the only being to whom I clung on earth."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," he gloomily replied, "the fatal deed is accomplished, and your life is rendered as desolate as my own. This is mete punishment for you; but I would have spared you, had you permitted it. You have wrought out your own destiny, and I have only been the instrument of Fate. Farewell, most false and perfidious of women; seek to repent of the evil you have done, that your destiny in the life to come may not be as dark as that you have given yourself in this."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph turned away, and left her alone.</p> 
               <p>For a few moments Alina sat stunned and overwhelmed by the sudden blow that had fallen upon her. She bitterly lamented the tragical fate of De Vere; but, even at that moment, she thought more of her own position, than of the untimely doom her fatal love had brought him. As his widow, she dared not claim recognition; for she well knew that the laws of Protestant England would not sanction the sophistry with which they had sought to delude themselves into the belief of the validity of their union.</p> 
               <p>Fierce and bitter resentment toward the author of her misery, mingled with the grief she felt for the loss of him to whom such love as she was capable of feeling had been<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6349-00000131"/> given. She caused the corpse of her lover to be brought into her cabin, and beside it she solemnly renewed her vow of vengeance against his destroyer. She kept watch beside him with tearless eyes and motionless features. De Vere's valet, who was much attached to him, was more demonstrative in his sorrow than she was, and she sent him away that his grief should not disturb her. She also dismissed her maid, who came shivering and crying from her bed when the man awoke her and told her what had happened. Alina wished to be alone, that she might brood over and mark out the course she would pursue in future.</p> 
               <p>The storm without continued to increase in violence, and soon the cries from the deck, the fearful pitching of the vessel, showed her that they were in imminent danger. Captain Weston, accompanied by De Vere's servant, came in to perform the sad service which they knew would be required; and his motionless form was securely lashed to the berth in which it had been placed. He entreated the pale watcher to take refreshment, which he had brought into her; but she motioned it imperiously away, and then he sat down beside her, and told her all that had occurred between the two combatants. He assured her that the duel had been fair, and no advantage had been taken of her lover; that he had pledged himself to De Vere to protect her till he would place her in the care of the friends to whom she was going. Alina listened passively, and when he finished speaking she drearily said:</p> 
               <p>"I have no friends; he was all I claimed, and he has been snatched from me by violence. But I shall find those who will aid me to fulfil the purpose of my life; yes-I shall surely find them. Leave me now; I cannot bear the sound of a human voice-the sight of a living face in this hour of supreme wretchedness."</p> 
               <p>Again she was alone with her dead; but no softness, no penitence came to her heart for the doom she had brought him. She only thought with vindictive bitterness of the hand that had accomplished it, and she registered her vow to become the Nemesis of his fate.</p> 
               <p>The storm continued to increase in violence, the ship was driven from her course, and surged through the billows with that heavy swash which proved that she had become unmanageable. Just before dawn, the mainmast fell with a crash which caused those on board to believe that all was lost; but the wreck was cut away, and again the staunch vessel righted, and ploughed her rudderless course through the surging waters that leaped and roared against her sides as if eager to engulf her as their prey.</p> 
               <p>Day dawned amid black and threatening clouds that portended no abatement in the strife of the elements; and the boldest seamen on board looked out on the raging waters with fear and dismay in their hearts. As the day advanced, the tragical event of the preceding night was whispered among the crew, and with the well-known superstition of sailors concerning the presence of a dead body upon a vessel, they declared that there would be no abatement in the storm till the corpse was removed.</p> 
               <p>The captain evaded them as long as possible, but when a second morning dawned and the gale still continued, he no longer refused to listen to them. It was impossible to keep the body of De Vere any longer, and as a sailor, he regarded a burial in the deep as far preferable to the narrow house assigned to the dead on land.</p> 
               <p>He anticipated much difficulty with Alina, but to his surprise she offered little opposition to his removal. The living form of her lover had been important to her, but of his dead body others were at liberty to dispose as seemed best to them, especially as this funeral at sea would relieve her from a sad and perplexing duty.</p> 
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6349-00000132"/> 
               <p>She had no desire to betray to the new world into which she was about to enter, the position she had held toward De Vere, and with quiet apathy she saw him removed from her sight.</p> 
               <p>Alina declined being present at the service which the captain read on deck; and sewed up in a hammock, with a cannon ball at his head and feet, all that remained of Sir Lionel De Vere was cast into the vexed waters, which greedily opened to receive him, and like a flash he sank to the depths of old ocean, one of the myriads who have found their last home in the deep.</p> 
               <p>As if to justify the superstition of the sailors, the storm sensibly abated within the next few hours, and by mid-day a lurid sun shone through the parting clouds. An observation was taken, and the ship was found to have drifted to the coast for which they were bound. A jury mast was rigged up, sails set, and her head turned on her proper course.</p> 
               <p>Before the dawn of the following day, the port lights of Havre were seen in the distance, and by sunrise the Walrus lay alongside of the wharf, ready to discharge her cargo.</p> 
               <p>Alina found a large sum of money in De Vere's dressing case, and from this she paid the two servants liberally, exacting from them a promise of secresy as to the actual cause of her lover's death and the relation she had sustained toward him. The valet intended to proceed at once to England, and she charged him with a letter to her aunt, in which she requested her to join her without delay in Paris, as through Mrs. Fitzhugh alone could she be identified as the heiress of Count Derval. She deferred till they met the explanation of the causes that brought her to France without her husband.</p> 
               <p>Betty, the maid, she retained with her, as she would need an attendant, and the simple-hearted creature seemed to have formed an attachment for her during the voyage.</p> 
                
               <p>Rudolph did not again appear before her, and, in obedience to her wishes, Captain Weston made arrangements for removing her at once to Paris. The valet was to travel post with her, and after placing her in suitable lodgings, he was to pursue his own way to England. The morning after the arrival of the Walrus, the Havre papers contained the following announcement:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"Died on board the American ship Walrus, on her passage out, Sir Lionel De Vere, a young English baronet, who had served several years in the British army in the United States. He was the representative of an ancient name, and the heir to a large fortune, but death found him in the flower of his manhood. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Requiescat in pace.</foreign>"</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Captain Weston was unwilling that any judicial investigation should be made into the affair which had occurred on his ship, and before landing, he called the crew together, and stated to them that sufficient cause for the duel had arisen between his two passengers; that he had recognized its necessity so far as to act as second for both parties. The combat had been conducted with due regard to all the laws of single combat, and the survivor was justly accountable to no man for the part he had taken in righting wrongs that could not be passed over. He insisted that nothing concerning it should be reported when they reached Havre, and the sailors, who had noted the dejection of the unhappy Rudolph, were unwilling to annoy him in any way. They readily pledged themselves not to speak of the event, and thus he was enabled to transact his business without the notoriety and vexations that must have attended any judicial investigation of the affair.</p> 
               <p>For this he was thankful, and in the constant employment of the next few weeks, his over-burdened mind found some respite from the corroding griefs that rankled there.<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6349-00000133"/> Rudolph had some knowledge of colloquial French, caught from the officers of that nation who had been his companions in arms, but he knew nothing of its literature; and although in time, to all outward seeming, he became a Frenchman; though he refused in after years to communicate with his countrymen in his own language, lest they might suspect his origin, he never acquired that perfect control of his new tongue which could enable him to express himself with that precision and force that was his birthright. He could still be energetic, but not elegant.</p> 
               <p>He saw Alina depart without an attempt to see her, for he felt that she was, as he had said, nothing to him.</p>

               <p>WHEN Waldron, the valet of De Vere, reached London, he sought out Mrs. Fitzhugh without delay, and delivered the letter with which Alina had entrusted him. Knowing how impossible it would be to conceal from her aunt what had occurred, Alina had tacitly permitted him to violate his pledge of secrecy with reference to her, as it would save herself the necessity of breaking to her, when they met, the painful events of the last few months.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh and Helen were at breakfast when a letter, deeply bordered and sealed with black, was brought up. Helen had grown into a graceful and elegant-looking girl, with an expression of ingenuous sweetness and candor that was extremely captivating. Her last term at school was just completed, and she had returned only the evening before to the protection of her mother, to remain with her till the hand that was already plighted could be claimed by her betrothed.</p> 
               <p>"Who can be dead that we know?" asked Helen, apprehensively, as she glanced toward the letter. "I hope nothing has happened to Reginald; but I am a little goose to think of such a thing when he left me in perfect health not twenty-four hours ago."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh glanced at the superscription, and changed color, for she recognized the writing of Alina.</p> 
               <p>"It is from your cousin, and I am afraid that some very painful affliction has befallen her. I fear her husband is dead."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> would not be considered an irreparable misfortune by her, I am afraid; but perhaps I judge her too harshly. What does she say, mamma? Poor Alina! I have deeply repented of what I did against her, but Heaven knows, I would have repaired my wrong if she would only have listened to me."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh read the few lines Alina had sent her, in bewildered alarm, and the change in her countenance communicated her feeling to her young companion.</p> 
               <p>"What is it, mother, dear? What does Alina say to make you grow so pale?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh dropped the letter, clasped her hands, and bent down her head in silent perturbation. Helen snatched up the paper, and read these words:</p> 
               <q>
                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"I am in Paris, widowed in heart, and alone. Come to me <emph>yourself,</emph> that you may enable me to claim the inheritance left me by my uncle. Waldron will tell you of the tragedy that occurred on the ship on which I came out; but for your own sake, and that of Helen, you will keep it to yourself.</p> 
                           <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6349-00000134"/> 
                           <p>"The wrong my cousin perpetrated against me has wrought out its legitimate consequences, for I believe that I have been more 'sinned against than sinning.' Lose no time in joining me, as it is important to have my claims settled as soon as possible.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>"Oh, mother, mother, what does she mean? what can she mean?" asked Helen, in consternation. "De Vere did not go to the United States? He could not have been so mad."</p> 
               <p>"He did go, in spite of all I could say to dissuade him from such a step. I concealed it from you, because it could do no good to tell you. The bearer of this letter must come up, that I may learn all he has to tell. It will be a painful story, my child, and you had better spare yourself the sorrow of hearing it."</p> 
               <p>"I must eventually learn its details, mother, and you can trust me not to reveal the misconduct of my cousin. I owe her that much as reparation, for I feel that I have indeed sinned against her."</p> 
               <p>"Since you will hear it, ring the bell, and conceal yourself behind the folds of yonder curtain. The man might hesitate to speak freely before you."</p> 
               <p>Helen rapidly obeyed her, and in compliance with Mrs. Fitzhugh's orders, in a few moments a respectable-looking man in deep mourning entered the room. Her emotion almost overpowered her as she rapidly said:</p> 
               <p>"You are Sir Lionel De Vere's valet; this letter refers me to you for some painful details. What has happened to your master? Nothing serious, I trust."</p> 
               <p>"Alas! madam, the most fatal thing that could befall him; Sir Lionel is dead."</p> 
               <p>A faint stifled cry came from the spot on which Helen was concealed, and Waldron turned in that direction.</p> 
               <p>"Madam, what I am permitted to say to you must be spoken in private, as Lady De Vere requested that to you alone I should reveal the events of the last few weeks."</p> 
               <p>"Lady De Vere! I am not interested in any person who can legally bear that name. This letter is from my late husband's niece, and she was already a wife. You may speak freely, for the person behind that curtain is as deeply interested in her as I am."</p> 
               <p>"Sir Lionel, madam, and the lady who bears his name, did not recognize the validity of her first marriage, and their first act, after she fled with him, was to be united by a priest. To that marriage I was a witness, and they were both satisfied that it was a true one."</p> 
               <p>"Then De Vere sought Alina, and she proved untrue to her wedded vows. Oh, I feared this! I feared this. And Rudolph? what of him? Tell me in as few words as possible, for I am tortured by this suspense."</p> 
               <p>"Sir Lionel assumed a false name, and took every precaution to evade Major Rudolph; but by a most unfortunate chance, they took passage on the same ship. He was known on board as Mr. Michel, and both had changed so much since they last met that neither recognized the other. They might have ended the voyage without coming in collision, but Major Rudolph saw his wife and knew her. He sought Sir Lionel, challenged him to deadly combat, and in the duel that followed my master lost his life. He was buried at sea, and the affair was so managed that no inquiry was made when we reached Havre. I took my lady to Paris, established her there, and came on to bring the news of Sir Lionel's decease to his brother."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh listened to these details in deep perturbation. She asked:</p> 
               <p>"And Rudolph is also in France? What was his purpose in going there?"</p> 
               <p>"The cargo on the ship belonged principally to him, and<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6349-00000135"/> I believe he intends to embark in trade in France. He has abjured his name and country, and no doubt he will soon manage so as to leave no clue to his former friends by which he can be traced."</p> 
               <p>"And this disgraceful story-what is to be done to conceal it? Mrs. Rudolph must be aware that, under English laws, she can never establish her claim as the widow of Sir Lionel De Vere."</p> 
               <p>"I do not think she has any such intention, madam. She desires to reside in France; to you, and to the brother of my late master, these facts must be made known; but beyond that I am pledged to secresy. I am now on my way to Vere Castle, and I only stopped in town to deliver the letter with which I was entrusted."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh continued to question him till all the minuti of what had occurred on the Walrus was known to her as far as Waldron himself was acquainted with the details. She then dismissed him, and Helen came forth wringing her hands in impotent despair.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mother, I have been the cause of all this misery. I am self-condemned and wretched. But for my fatal interference, De Vere would now have been living. Alina would have been his lawful wife, and the evil that is in her might have lain dormant amid the life of prosperity he could have ensured her."</p> 
               <p>"It might have been so, Helen; but I am afraid that your cousin is not a good woman, and I am sadly conscious that my instructions developed the seeds of evil in her nature in place of eradicating them. I begin now to see my error, and repent of it. Reason and nature are not the only gods to which humanity should bow. Yet, if there had been one spark of true divinity in Alina, the noble man to whom she plighted her faith would have developed it; but she wilfully deceived, and then deserted him. Do not blame yourself too severely, my love; for, even as the wife of De Vere, I believe, after the first glamour of passion was past, that she would have rendered him miserable."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mother! what will Reginald say when he hears this fatal story? He will blame me as the real cause of his brother's tragical fate; for I will not conceal from him any portion of my guilt."</p> 
               <p>"Conceal nothing from him, Helen, that, as your betrothed husband, he has a right to know. Reignald will pardon everything to you, if he loves you as he should."</p> 
               <p>"And Alina? She will hate me more fervently than ever, when she knows that I am to take the position she was anxious to attain as mistress of Vere Castle. Oh! I now wish that Reginald and I had never met, never loved each other; for it seems cruel to build my own happiness on the downfall of hopes I have been instrumental in crushing."</p> 
               <p>"My dear Helen, your self-condemnation is too excessive, though I love you better for this sensibility. Alina will never forgive you, I can well believe; but blessed in the love of Reginald, your sphere will be so widely severed from hers that you need never meet. As your husband, Reginald will be more lenient toward her, and he may possibly admit her claims on his late brother so far as to allow her an annuity from the estate. The splendors and pleasures of life are more to Alina than anything else, and she will soon be consoled if the heir is liberal toward her."</p> 
               <p>"But nothing can restore the life which has been sacrificed; for that I must ever feel remorse."</p> 
               <p>"Sir Lionel risked the consequences, with a full knowledge of what might result from his elopement with Alina. He is at rest; let masses be said for the repose of his soul, and you can perform such penance as your confessor may deem necessary. By this event, unfortunate as it is, Reginald is placed at once in a position to claim your promised<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6349-00000136"/> hand, and so soon as the first mourning for his brother is over, he will, doubtless, wish your union to take place. Cheer up, my darling, for you had no thought of evil against De Vere when you withheld his letter to your cousin. You believed that you were serving him, and an error of judgment in a child is not to be too harshly censured."</p> 
               <p>"But I am afraid I was instigated by a feeling of revenge against her, as much as by the wish to save Sir Lionel from a marriage that could have brought him only unhappiness."</p> 
               <p>"He accomplished that union at last, and death has only saved him from awakening from his fond delusion; from as great misery as poor Rudolph is now enduring. Let not all our sympathy be given to the erring dead, when the wronged man who yet lives has so heavy a burden to bear."</p> 
               <p>"And I permitted him to clasp her hand in a marriage which I knew could be no true one. Oh! mother, I must ever bow my head in humiliation for this rash deed, and I feel that I shall be punished for it more bitterly than I have yet been."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh used all her art to console her; but Helen wept unceasingly while she was preparing to set out on her journey to Paris. The young girl did not ask to accompany her mother, for she knew that her presence would only be an irritation to her cousin, and she also shrank from again meeting Alina.</p> 
               <p>On the arrival of Mrs. Fitzhugh and Helen in England, Reginald De Vere was residing in chambers, in London, preparing himself for his chosen career as a lawyer. He called on the widow of his brother's friend, saw Helen, and was greatly struck with her frank and open character, as well as charmed by her peculiar beauty, which consisted more in mobility, and vivacity of expression, than in regularity of features. He soon became a constant visitor, and during the vacations, which Helen spent with her mother, he had many opportunities of seeing her. Each interview deepened the impression she had made upon his heart, and on her side a strong attachment also grew up, which ended in their betrothal.</p> 
               <p>From the large estate inherited by his brother, Reginald had only a younger son's portion-a few thousand pounds, the income from which was a bare support. He watched with much interest for Sir Lionel's return, in the hope that he would place him in such a position as would enable him to marry as soon as Helen left her school.</p> 
               <p>Now, there was no impediment to their speedy union, but Helen had in her heart no room for exultation at the brilliant prospects that opened before her, gained as they had been by a fault of her own, which was so bitterly repented.</p> 
               <p>When her mother left her alone, she sat down at once, and wrote to her lover. With perfect frankness, she related all that had occurred, and made no effort to palliate the mistaken course she had pursued. She appealed to him as her judge, and declared herself ready to abide by his decision, whether it condemned her to perpetual exile from himself, or recalled her to his heart in the forgiveness of perfect love.</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"I have merited punishment," she concluded, "and if it comes from your beloved hand, I must bow my head in humble submission. I have meddled with the fate of others in a most unjustifiable manner, and the tragic result to all parties concerned, has taught me that God alone is the director of human destiny. This bitter lesson has been sent, to show me how impotent are our feeble efforts to guard or guide those we love from the perils that threaten them. I would have saved my dear friend from a marriage<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6349-00000137"/> that I believed would bring him only wretchedness, and in so doing, I have given him over to death. Oh, Reginald! pity and forgive me, for my heart is breaking with the remorse that fills it."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Four days must elapse before an answer could arrive, and Helen spent them in a wretched state of suspense and dread.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh, accompanied only by a trusty courier, set out for Paris that evening, after again placing Helen under the charge of the principal of the school she had so lately left. She had the address of Alina, and without any incident worth recording, she reached her lodgings in one of the principal streets of Paris.</p> 
               <p>She was conducted through a wide hall, and a light tap upon a door was answered by Betty, who invited her to enter a darkened room hung with funeral drapery. If the inward woe corresponded with the outward semblance that met her eyes, the visitor felt that it must be deep indeed; but she could not avoid thinking that the "grief which passeth show," does not thus ostentatiously parade its trappings before others.</p> 
               <p>As her eyes became accustomed to the gloom, she saw a figure reclining in a large chair; a white hand was put forth from the shrouding crape that enveloped it, and after a burst of emotion, Alina spoke in French, with a bitter and hard intonation:</p> 
               <p>"You have come, madam, to witness and condemn the working out of your own precepts. Remember that <emph>you</emph> taught me that I was a free creature, accountable only to myself, and the Reason which has been given me, for the use I make of my life. Therefore, I am not prepared to listen to censure, much as you may feel disposed to utter it."</p> 
                
               <p>"Alina, my poor, lost child," faltered her aunt, "I have only compassion in my heart for one so fearfully punished as you have been. If you have sinned, you have also suffered, and I do not place myself in the position of your judge. I came hither only to help and console you. To aid you in establishing yourself in a respectable position, which will enable you to retrieve the past."</p> 
               <p>"It is well; if such are your intentions we shall not clash. I am in that state of nervous irritability which unfits one for everything. I can only sit, and dream of what might have been, and contrast it with the sad reality before me. I was the <emph>wife</emph> of Sir Lionel De Vere, though the unjust law will refuse to recognize me as his widow, and I must conceal my union with the man I loved, and waive my right to that portion of his estate which should be mine. Tell me, do you know Sir Reginald De Vere? Will he utterly ignore my existence, and refuse to do me justice?"</p> 
               <p>"I know him well, for he is a constant visitor of ours. He is liberal, and I think may be influenced in your favor, though he will utterly deny your legal right to claim anything from him."</p> 
               <p>"Yet, as a true son of Mother Church, he is bound to recognize the validity of my marriage as much as his brother did. Sir Lionel taught me to believe, with himself, that I was free to form new ties."</p> 
               <p>"Alina, this is sophistry that might beguile two hearts resolute to accomplish their own wishes at all risks; but in England, if such a claim as yours was seriously put forward, you would render yourself liable to a prosecution for bigamy, for the law there does not recognize the right of an undivorced woman to give her hand in marriage."</p> 
               <p>"I fully comprehend that, and I have no such rash intention. I only demand from the present possessor of the<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6349-00000138"/> estate such a provision as will prove his respect for his brother's memory."</p> 
               <p>"It seems strange to me that you insist on this, when your uncle's bequest places you in an independent position."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," she bitterly retorted, "my income will find me in bread and clothes, provided I am not too extravagant in the latter; but I am not one to be contented in a mediocre position. My family is noble, my tastes are luxurious, and when I again enter the world, I must do so under such auspices as will enable me to reinstate myself in the brilliant position of which the act of that madman deprived me. I never will forgive him, and I will find means to reach him yet."</p> 
               <p>Though a worldly woman herself, Mrs. Fitzhugh was shocked by this discussion in the first hour of their meeting, under such painful and humiliating circumstances. She said:</p> 
               <p>"He to whom you allude has surely suffered enough at your hands already; endeavor to atone for the past, Alina, and do not seek to avenge that which your own conduct provoked. Bury the irretrievable past in oblivion, and let the unhappy man who once adoringly loved you go on his way unmolested."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>His love!</emph>" she disdainfully said. "It has been the bane of my life. You have no vital interest in the wretched ending of all my bright visions, or you could not speak thus. I committed a fatal error in giving Rudolph such power over my fate, but even my marriage with him gave him no right to pursue and crush me as he has done. Let him beware, for I will become to him as dire a Nemesis as she of old."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh listened in deep sorrow; after a pause she said:</p> 
               <p>"Let us not speak of these things. I came hither to aid you as far as lies in my power, by placing you in a position to claim your inheritance. I have brought with me all the papers that were forwarded to me, and I also have the address of the advocate in whose hands your uncle's will was left."</p> 
               <p>"It was fortunate for me that Count Derval made me his heir, for I shudder to think of the destitute position in which I should have found myself placed but for this bequest. De Vere should have provided against it, but we were both too much absorbed in our happiness to dream of its abrupt conclusion in so tragic a manner."</p> 
               <p>She appeared greatly depressed, although her words implied so keen an interest in her worldly affairs, that Mrs. Fitzhugh could not resist the belief that Alina regretted the loss of her lover's fortune quite as much as she lamented himself.</p> 
               <p>In their subsequent conversations not one emotion of penitence was expressed; throughout all, she considered herself the wronged party, and she could not, or would not, see that her own want of principle had placed her in her present painful position. At times she expressed the most passionate regrets for the loss of her lover, but never failed to recur to the injustice which deprived her of the consideration due to his widow, and to urge on her aunt the necessity of influencing Sir Reginald De Vere in her favor so far as to induce him to grant her a life annuity on his late brother's estate.</p> 
               <p>This Mrs. Fitzhugh readily pledged herself to do, though she could promise nothing as to the result of her mediation. Sir Reginald himself must be the sole judge of the consideration due to her claims.</p> 
               <p>In expectation of her aunt's arrival, a room, by Alina's orders, had been prepared for her use, and Mrs. Fitzhugh was soon installed in it. She had friends in Paris, who<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6349-00000139"/> were summoned to her assistance, and everything was placed in train for a speedy settlement of the business that had brought her there.</p> 
               <p>In the course of a few weeks Alina was formally recognized as the heiress of the deceased Count Derval, and as no male heir to the title existed, she at once decided on assuming it herself. The property was securely invested, and a small estate in the vicinity of Versailles devolved to her on which was a cottage orne, which her uncle had used as a bachelor residence when he was not in attendance on the court.</p> 
               <p>Alina also found a distant connection in the person of an elderly baroness, who had been the life-long friend of her deceased uncle. Madame L'Estrange was a widow of narrow means and luxurious habits, and she insinuated to her young relation, that the best thing she could do would be to take possession of La Rosire-as the place was called-and accept her as her companion. The baroness was received at court, and she could easily introduce into that magic realm so lovely and graceful a creature as her young kinswoman: her success there might compensate her for the misfortunes of the past.</p> 
               <p>Alina eagerly grasped at the suggestions of Madame, to whom she represented herself as the widow of an American officer who had been slain in fighting the battles of his country. Before Mrs. Fitzhugh left her she removed to La Rosire, which was found to be sufficiently spacious for the establishment she could afford to keep. The place was in good order, and the furniture as elegant and expensive as a man of the late Count Derval's luxurious tastes would be likely to select.</p> 
               <p>Alina was really charmed with the beauty of her surroundings, and almost forgot her late bitter experiences in the delight of her new possessions, and the agreeable prospects pects that opened before her ambitious and unscrupulous mind.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">BRIDAL PROSPECTS.</head> 
               <p>MRS. FITZHUGH was extremely anxious to return to Helen, from whom she had received but two brief notes since they parted. From these she gathered that the young girl was suffering in health, and wretched at not hearing from her lover. She evidently believed that Sir Reginald had cast her off without a word in answer to her appeal; for since he had not deigned to reply to it, his contempt for her conduct must have destroyed his love.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh did not believe such a result possible, for she understood the generous character of the new heir too well to believe that he would desert the girl to whom he was devotedly attached, for an act she had so deeply repented of, so candidly confessed, when it could so easily have been kept from his knowledge. Some accident must have delayed Helen's letter or De Vere's reply, and she earnestly wished to return to her as speedily as possible, to console and sustain her through this trying time.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh felt that she should not leave Alina without informing her of the prospective marriage of her cousin and the heir of Vere Castle; yet she shrank from the task, for she knew that she would feel bitter resentment that the crown which had been snatched from her own brow had fallen on that of Helen. Yet she knew that Alina would more deeply resent being kept in ignorance of the betrothal till it could no longer be concealed from her; therefore she nerved herself for the scene that she felt would ensue.</p> 
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6349-00000140"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh saw that her niece was rapidly recovering her spirits; that, at moments, she was almost gay. To her light, unimpressionable nature, life seemed almost as fair as in the first days of her innocent youth, and she evidently looked forward to a brilliant career in the new sphere into which fortune had cast her.</p> 
               <p>On the evening before her departure, her aunt sought a private interview with Alina, and after some circumlocution, revealed to her the unwelcome news that Helen was the chosen wife of Sir Reginald De Vere. She listened in utter silence, but there was a hysterical swelling in her throat, her hands nervously clutched each other, and a vivid spot of crimson gathered in her cheeks. Her eyes gleamed with an expression of intense anger, and after a bitter struggle, she spoke in a tone of deep and concentrated passion:</p> 
               <p>"So-o, after all, Helen, my enemy, my triumphant foe, will bear the name which should have been mine: which but for <emph>her</emph> baseness would have been legally mine. She will reign as a queen in my place. Oh! Madam, this is adding the last bitter drop to my cup! Could you not have spared me this crowning humiliation, for such I feel it to be."</p> 
               <p>"You must soon have learned it, Alina; and I thought it best to speak to you myself before we part. Poor Helen has so truly repented of the wrong she did you, that forgiveness should be accorded to her. She will make every atonement that lies in her power, and through her influence with Sir Reginald, I hope to gain a recognition of the claims you have upon him."</p> 
               <p>"I will accept of nothing that is to be won through Helen's intervention," she passionately replied. "I detest her, as the author of all I have suffered. But for her, I should now be honored, and happy; the mistress of a noble home, with the man I loved beside me. He lies in his bloody shroud at the bottom of the sea, and I am here, in comparative poverty and obscurity, while Helen steps into the station I should have occupied. Do you think that I can or will forgive her? Let her repent; it is fitting that she should do so, but if she does not yet find deeper cause of sorrow, I am much mistaken. I do not permit any one to thwart and trample on me with impunity."</p> 
               <p>"Alina, am I to understand this as a threat against your cousin? Will you never see that you have made your own path, and my poor Helen, wrong as she acted, is not accountable for what has since occurred? I am afraid that your perceptions of right are so blunted, that you can never behold the truth."</p> 
               <p>"If they are, madam, I believe that I am chiefly indebted to your instructions for that perversion. I am what your precepts and my cousin's perfidy have made me. I have no faith in anything save my own will, guided by the subtle intellect which is my best inheritance. They shall work out my purposes, whether dark or bright, and yet place me on a height even above that to which Helen now aspires. Lady De Vere! ha! ha! Let her look to it, for to the bearer of that name, I declare inextinguishable hatred. <emph>Her</emph> son shall never succeed to the title; no-I swear it."</p> 
               <p>"Alina, this is mere raving. I have no fears for Helen, for she will be placed far beyond your reach; and if God gives her children in the marriage she is about to form, they will succeed to their father's inheritance in spite of your evil threats."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! you think so?" and a strange expression swept over her face. "Perhaps an obstacle may arise-who knows? But this recrimination is futile. What I will do, I will do, in spite of Fate itself. Congratulate Helen for me, but do not fail to tell her to remember my words to her<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6349-00000141"/> when we last saw each other. She will recall them; she will know that I have forgotten nothing, and that time, in place of blunting, has only given keener edge to my resentment. There, madam, I believe you have told me all you have to reveal, and I have spoken my true feelings concerning this marriage. Let us part in peace; I have no quarrel against you, though in your heart you are exulting in the thought that your darling is about to deck her brow with the bridal wreath which she falsely, and even cruelly snatched from mine."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Alina! lost! lost! ruined child! You will destroy yourself if you encourage such dark and bitter feelings. To forgive an injury is the divinest instinct implanted by Heaven in the human heart. Alas, my child, do not stifle every gentle and true emotion that arises within you."</p> 
               <p>Alina answered with intense scorn:</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely expected an appeal to Heaven from <emph>your</emph> lips, madam. In other days you taught me that a paradise, if attained at all, must be found in the human mind. I have failed to gain that inward peace which is the evidence of its existence; a wild pandemonium wars, at times within my breast, and if it developes evil acts, who shall blame <emph>me</emph> for following the instincts of my nature? Not you, who first led me to the mountain top, and like the tempter of old, bade me look out upon the fair world, which should be mine if I had the courage to appropriate its best gifts. I <emph>have</emph> the courage, the skill, and the daring, so you may rejoice in the progress of your pupil."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh gazed on her in appalled silence. Had this, indeed, been the result of her training? As time progressed, as her vision of life enlarged, she had gradually learned the great lesson taught by the divine Lawgiver, and she would have given much to be able to undo what she had done toward destroying faith in His precepts in the mind committed to her guidance. She burst in tears as she said:</p> 
               <p>"I am now a believer; an humble Christian, Alina, and I would to God the power to repair the past was mine. I can only pray for you, and seek forgiveness for the evil I have been the means of inculcating. God is powerful; He can accomplish all things, and in His hands I must leave your unhappy fate. Oh, child! do not utterly break my heart by persisting in the wicked course you seem resolved to run."</p> 
               <p>"I shall work out the destiny prepared for me," replied Alina, with apathetic calmness. "Quiet your conscience, madam, and leave to me the responsibility of my future acts; I am willing to bear it."</p> 
               <p>She arose as she finished speaking, and swept rapidly from the room. Mrs. Fitzhugh sat till twilight gathered around her, absorbed in painful thought, her eyes fixed on the fair scene on which the windows opened, though she was utterly unconscious of the soft beauty of the evening; for spring had come, and budding leaves, and early flowers cast their fragrance over the miniature lawn that lay in front of the cottage.</p> 
               <p>With the lights Madame L'Estrange came in, and prattled in her weary ears of the Court, which was soon coming to Versailles, and of the influential position she might gain there if she could only revive some dormant claims to distinction which had once belonged to her family. She was still a handsome, well preserved woman, though verging toward her sixtieth year, skilled in all the finesse of fashionable life, and nothing could have suited her better than the opportunity afforded her of increasing her own importance by becoming the chaperon of so lovely and ambitious a creature as she knew her young relative to be. She felt assured that her protge would rise above her present level, and her own interests be proportionably benefitted.</p> 
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6349-00000142"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh began to fear that she was not the best person to be entrusted with such a charge, but she had no power to change the arrangements which had already been made, and with a heavy sigh she finally said:</p> 
               <p>"Madame, my niece is a person of strong will and quick temper; to you I leave her guardianship, in the hope that you will guide her aright. You have had much experience in life, and you will know how to teach her to avoid the quicksands in which a young and beautiful woman may be engulfed."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, I can do that, and much more," was the vivacious rejoinder. "I will conduct our fair countess to the high places of the earth, and with her charms and talents she may win anything to which she chooses to aspire. When Alina's mourning is over, you will hear of a brilliant dbut in society."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Madame, only teach her to be a good woman, and I shall be satisfied."</p> 
               <p>The French woman stared at her as if she did not exactly comprehend her meaning; she shrugged her shoulders expressively, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">oui, oui;</foreign> of course she must go to mass and do penance for her sins. This is her confessor's affair, and I intend to send her mine. He is a great man, and an elegant gentleman too. Yes, Monseigneur le Cardinal de Rohan is one of the elegantes of the Court. He does not often condescend to act as confessor, but for reasons of his own he attends a few noble ladies. I possess influence in a certain quarter, and he is my very good friend. He admires charming women, and la Comtesse will be sure to win a place among his lves. Yes, madam, trust your niece to us, for we will do great things for her."</p> 
               <p>This was not exactly what Mrs. Fitzhugh meant, but she despaired of giving the frivolous baroness any idea of her real meaning, so she turned away, and in a few moments retired to her own apartment.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning she left La Rosire; she had a brief parting interview with Alina, who thanked her for her efforts to serve her, and coldly expressed the hope that they might meet again, though she gave her no invitation to visit her. The thought that her aunt was returning to Helen, to witness her marriage with the heir of Vere Castle, filled her with bitterness. She asked:</p> 
               <p>"When will Helen assume her new state?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot tell-but probably not before autumn. She is very young, and there is no need to hurry matters."</p> 
               <p>"You will hear from me before that time, and-yet no, it will be time enough when my hopes are realized."</p> 
               <p>"I do not understand you, Alina; but it matters very little. Will you not keep up a regular correspondence with me? You speak as if you expected to maintain silence for many months."</p> 
               <p>"What will be the use of exchanging letters filled with hypocritical professions of regard? There is little love between us, for all yours is lavished on Helen. I shall not write till I have something of interest to communicate to Sir Reginald De Vere."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh was alarmed. She hastily said:</p> 
               <p>"Make no effort to break this marriage, Alina; I beseech you to have more respect for yourself."</p> 
               <p>She broke into a mocking laugh.</p> 
               <p>"Believe me when I assure you that I have no such intention. Let Helen become Lady De Vere, and find such happiness as she may. I have a presentiment that it will not be much. Good bye; I hope you will get safely to London. Tell my cousin that I shall be sure to send her a bridal present."</p> 
               <p>She lightly kissed her aunt, and they parted.</p> 
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6349-00000143"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh found Helen pale and wretched, suffering both physically and mentally, for the state of her mind had seriously affected her health. She had never received a line from her lover, nor seen him during the tedious six weeks of her mother's absence; and, with the impetuosity of youth she declared her conviction that De Vere had forever relinquished her. That so deep was his disgust for the part she had played that he did not consider her worthy even of a word to soften the bitterness of her lot. She had no one near her in whom she was willing to confide, and the wearing anguish of the last weeks of her life had reduced her to a mere shadow of her former self.</p> 
               <p>Her mother at once removed her to her former lodgings, and surrounded her with such tender cares that the poor girl made an effort to smile and listen cheerfully to the words of hope she uttered.</p> 
               <p>As the best panacea for this wounded heart, Mrs. Fitzhugh took measures to ascertain where De Vere was, and what had occasioned his mysterious silence. In a few days, she learned that he had gone on a trip to Scotland before the arrival of Waldron at the Castle, but was now expected there in a few days.</p> 
               <p>A long delayed letter for Helen, written in the Highlands, arrived, from which she learned that this was one of several sent by De Vere which had failed to reach their destination. He had suddenly left his home to accompany a college friend on a trip to Gretna Green with his runaway bride, and the party was now spending a few weeks in the Highlands with a relative of the groom.</p> 
               <p>It was evident that De Vere had never received the last letter of Helen; his silence with reference to it was thus satisfactorily accounted for; but she was still in a state of miserable uncertainty as to the final result of her communication.</p> 
                
               <p>Just as her fears began to communicate themselves to her mother, a scarcely legible scrawl, dated from Vere Castle, was received. He wrote:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"I have just returned home to hear the wretched tidings of my unhappy brother's guilt and its speedy retribution. Oh! would to God he had not thus died. My poor, poor Lionel! the handsome, the brave, the free-hearted, cut down in the flower of his manhood, and cast into the remorseless deep! If they had brought him back to the home of his fathers, that his ashes might have reposed in peace beside theirs, I could more easily be consoled.</p>
                  <p>"It is a bitter affliction that my brother should have committed this wrong-that he should have died for it; but I must seek for strength to bear it where alone it may be found. Waldron has told me all, and your heart, my Helen, is lacerated with my own. So soon as I can regain composure I will come to town; and your sweet voice, your tender smile, shall bring back peace to my unquiet spirit."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Helen read these words with a beating heart and varying color. Still there was no allusion to her confession. He had evidently never received it, and she was yet in doubt as to her happiness. On the following morning her fears were set at rest by the following missive:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"My darling Helen, how much you must have suffered while awaiting my reply to the most touching letter that ever man received. I found it hid away among a pile of papers which had been thrown upon the library table, read it with tears gathering in my eyes, and hasten to answer it.</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful spirit of candor and truthfulness, always remain the same, and I shall continue to adore you as long as life is granted me. You committed a great wrong, but you<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6349-00000144"/> were too young to comprehend the results that might flow from it. You loved him who has gone from among us, and it was for his sake you risked so much. Forgive you, my sweet love? I have nothing to forgive, and you must permit no morbid feeling of remorse to weigh upon your heart. On the two actors in this sad drama the accountability rests, not on you.</p>
                  <p>"I will come to you as soon as possible, but there are many claims on my attention here, and I cannot escape for a week to come. At the end of that time, expect to see me, for I yearn for a sight of your sweet face, for the music of your beloved voice."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Helen wept tears of heartfelt thankfulness over these precious lines; she read them again and again, and seemed as one endued with new life. For the first time for many days, she arose from her sofa, robed herself in the light mourning she had ordered to be prepared, and looked into her glass, to see how it became her; for Reginald was coming, and she wished to be charming in his eyes.</p> 
               <p>The pale cheeks and hollow eyes that met her gaze showed how deeply she had lately suffered, but she thought: "When he comes I shall bloom again, for he is the sun of my life, and by this change he will see that without him I should die."</p> 
               <p>At the appointed time De Vere arrived, but in the interim, Helen had almost recovered her freshness, and only in her tearful eyes and grateful smile could the history of the painful struggle through which she had passed be read.</p> 
               <p>Sir Reginald was very unlike his brother in appearance. His form was taller, and more robust; and his brown hair, blue eyes, and serene expression revealed a man of an entirely different stamp. Sir Lionel had been passionate, wilful, and haughty. Reginald was thoughtful, tender, and upright. He bore his mother's nature within him, while the elder brother had been a true representative of the dark and proud De Veres, who, for ages, had borne down all opposition by the iron hand of power.</p> 
               <p>In this first interview with Helen, he did not allude to their speedy marriage; for to a man of his delicate sensibility, it would have seemed like snatching the flower of happiness from the grave of his brother. Lionel's death had given him the power to claim his betrothed, but a suitable period must elapse before bridal rejoicings could replace the mourning due to one he had tenderly loved.</p> 
               <p>De Vere had a long interview with Mrs. Fitzhugh, in which she related to him, without reserve, the whole history of Alina, as far as it was known to herself. She alluded with reserve to her niece's expectations with regard to a provision from the estate, for it pained her, that Alina should have so pertinaciously insisted that she should make them known to the heir. With that delicacy which was a marked feature in his character, the young baronet spared her all further embarrassment by saying:</p> 
               <p>"I have already settled this matter, my dear madam. The woman who was dear to my brother, must be remembered by me, although headlong passion hurried her into the step which led to such grievous consequences. Lionel was the party most to blame, for he sought her out, and for the wrong he has done in tearing her from her home and country, I must repay her as far lies in my power. I have already settled upon her an annuity of five hundred pounds, which will be annually paid by my bankers. You can inform your niece of this arrangement, at your earliest convenience, and tell her to draw on Messrs. Rodrigness, Hortaling &amp; Co. for the amount. I had rather not write to her myself."</p> 
               <p>"There is no need that you should do so," replied Mrs.<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6349-00000145"/> Fitzhugh, hastily, for she was by no means willing that any communication should be opened between Alina and the betrothed husband of Helen. She had a vague dread that if such a thing occurred, her niece would endeavor to undermine, and, in time, destroy the happiness of one she so bitterly detested.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh wrote immediately to Alina, informing her of the liberality of De Vere, and to this letter she replied in the following brief terms:</p> 
               <q>
                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"I received your letter; and I shall draw on the bankers for the pitiful sum allowed me from an income of twenty thousand pounds, which would never have been Sir Reginald De Vere's, if he, who was my true husband, had lived. A liberal man would have provided for me as his brother's widow, but for the present I accept this pittance. You can say to him what you choose, as I am not thankful for such trifling favors, and I will not express what I do not feel."</p> 
                           <closer>
                              <signed>"ALINA, COMTESSE DERVAL."</signed>
                           </closer> 
                        </div>

                  </floatingText>
               </q> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh simply informed Sir Reginald that his annuity had been accepted by her niece, and henceforth her name was not mentioned among them. It was arranged that the marriage of the lovers should take place early in the fall, and the happy summer that followed was indeed the summer of Helen's life. A portion of it was spent in a village by the sea side, in the vicinity of Vere Castle, and Sir Reginald daily joined herself and her mother in their rambles and drives through the surrounding country.</p> 
               <p>The settlements were preparing, the trousseau had been ordered, and two happy hearts were hourly knit in closer union by the free intercourse which permitted each one to know and appreciate the good traits of the other, happily unconscious of the brooding malice of her who thought of their happiness only to devise means of thwarting it.</p> 
                
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh had not delivered Alina's message to Helen, for she did not wish to cast a cloud over the serene tenor of her present life, and she felt assured that the sphere of the future Lady De Vere would be too far removed from her cousin's to permit Alina's evil influence to fall within it.</p> 
               <p>Thus the placid hours glided away. Vere Castle was undergoing repairs, and being magnificently furnished for the reception of its new mistress, for Sir Reginald thought nothing too fine or too elegant for his young bride.</p>

               <head type="sub">STRANGE VICISSITUDES.</head> 
               <p>IN his new career, Rudolph brought all the energy and activity of his mind to bear upon the business he had undertaken. He toiled incessantly to escape from the wearing sense of desolation and loneliness that preyed upon him. Amid new associations, hearing only the sounds of a foreign language around him, at times he felt as if walking in a strange dream, which would flit away and bring to his waking vision the realities he had once so dearly prized. But a sudden pang of memory would effectually arouse him, and all the old anguish he lived over again.</p> 
               <p>He no longer loved Alina; a deep and bitter disgust had taken the place of the passion which had filled so large a space in his life; but in crushing it out he seemed to have destroyed the spring of hope. He mechanically pursued his daily avocations; with his natural shrewdness, conducted his business affairs in such a manner as ensured success; and, in the course of a few months, he was well<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6349-00000146"/> known to the mercantile men in Havre as the foreign tobacco merchant; for it was in that article alone he dealt.</p> 
               <p>He was known to them as M. Michel, and although, as yet, he spoke French imperfectly, his fine presence and gentlemanly bearing made so agreeable an impression on those he had dealings with that he was frequently invited to visit their families, with the benevolent hope that he might be drawn out of the depressing gloom that evidently preyed upon his mind.</p> 
               <p>But these invitations were invariably declined; for, in his present state of feeling, society was too distasteful to him to be voluntarily sought. By the close of the spring his speculations had secured for him a few thousand dollars; and weary of the distasteful calling he had adopted, which was so foreign to all the former habits of his life, he began to make arrangements for returning to his former profession, though where he should seek service he had not yet determined.</p> 
               <p>All his leisure hours were spent in the study of military tactics, and the masterly skill which distinguished him in later years was thus acquired. He was in the habit of spending his only day of rest in the grounds attached to a small cottage situated in the outskirts of the town. In them was a bower which looked toward the sea; and seated on a rustic bench, with his hat drawn over his eyes, poring over his book, or drawing diagrams with his pencil upon the blank leaves, he might be seen every succeeding Sunday.</p> 
               <p>There was a narrow winding path, leading from the knoll on which his favorite retreat was placed, to the beach below. This Rudolph frequently descended and walked for hours upon the smooth sands, endeavoring, in rapid motion, to drive away the thronging thoughts that would intrude.</p> 
               <p>One evening in early summer he had taken his usual stroll, and was slowly ascending the pathway again, when he became aware, from the sound of voices above, that his retreat had been invaded by strangers in his absence. Unwilling to encounter them in the frame of mind in which he then was, he paused, and looking around found on one side a recess in which he could sit until the new comers had departed.</p> 
               <p>Their words were wafted toward him, but he did not heed them till the sound of his assumed name struck upon his ear. It was growing late, and the visitors to the cabaret had mostly departed, or had gathered in the wine shop to take their parting cup. The speakers evidently believed themselves entirely alone, for they spoke without precaution.</p> 
               <p>"I say, Pierre, this Michel has returned to town by the beach. What is the use of watching here when the bird has flown?"</p> 
               <p>"Because he will certainly return this way. He often walks on the sands till a late hour, and when he comes up the hill, we can deal with him. This is the most convenient spot for the work we have to do, for we can take him to the sea and throw him in, without any one being the wiser."</p> 
               <p>Though this was spoken in a rough kind of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">patois,</foreign> Rudolph understood it, for he had been thrown much with the working population of the town, in his late business career, and he had rapidly learned their peculiar dialect. A new blow seemed to be struck upon his heart, for he felt that he was pursued at the command of Alina. He recalled her threats, and he knew that from her hand alone could this new danger proceed.</p> 
               <p>He sat quite still, and listened keenly for what might follow: the voice of the other assassin warningly said:</p> 
               <p>"Hist! do not speak so loud, Jacques; our covey might come up the bank and hear us."</p> 
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6349-00000147"/> 
               <p>"If he was to, he wouldn't understand us, for he aint been here long enough to learn our lingo. I say, Pierre, this is a precious welcome to give to a brother republican, for this man is an American."</p> 
               <p>"Why should we care what he is, provided we get paid for the job we engaged to do. A hundred crowns aint picked up in the street, I reckon, and I've killed too many men to care for the life of this one because he comes from that wild country where savages and negroes live."</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Parbleu!</foreign> you talk like a man of sense, and I am a fool. We must ply our trade, or starve."</p> 
               <p>"No-any man can earn an honest living if it is his will to do so," said a stern voice, and in another instant the tall figure of Rudolph bounded from the ravine, and stood before them. He held a pistol in each hand, with which he covered the two forms before him, as he coolly said:</p> 
               <p>"Stand, and deliver your credentials for the crime you came hither to commit, or I will shoot you down. Make the least motion toward your arms, and I fire, and I am a dead shot."</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Diable!</foreign>" muttered Jacques, "I told you not to speak so loud, Pierre, but you must always be prating."</p> 
               <p>He then spoke aloud:</p> 
               <p>"We are in your power, Monsieur, and call for a truce."</p> 
               <p>"Lay your pistols on that bench where I can see them, and then I will talk with you."</p> 
               <p>The men obeyed, though they were careful to keep guard over the discarded weapons. Rudolph then uncocked his own pistols and returned them to his pocket; he drew near the men, but kept a vigilant eye upon them, lest they should attempt to use their knives in an unguarded moment. He sternly said:</p> 
               <p>"You were seeking me with the most deadly intentions. I overheard your words, and fully comprehended them. I am a stranger in this country, and I do not know why my life should be sought by you. Speak-solve this enigma, for I must understand it."</p> 
               <p>Jacques remained obstinately silent, and Pierre assumed the office of spokesman.</p> 
               <p>"We were set on by a woman, that's all <emph>I</emph> know about it. Your own conscience can tell you who, and what, your enemy is. We saw the agent; we get the pay when the deed's done, and there our business with our employer ends."</p> 
               <p>"Who then was the agent, and where does she live?"</p> 
               <p>"She's an old file that <emph>you'll</emph> never make anything out of, so I don't mind telling you that she lives in Paris. We were sent here to find you."</p> 
               <p>"You speak truly," said Rudolph. "I know too well who set you on; and now, my fine fellows, I have a bargain to make with you in my turn. I could call out and have you arrested, but I forbear on one condition. I will even pay you the same amount of blood money you were to have received on that condition."</p> 
               <p>"Name it," said Jacques, "we work for money, and yours is as good as that of any other person."</p> 
               <p>"That is well. Return to Paris, and take with you this pocket-book, which your employer will recognize as mine. In it are a hundred crowns, and more. Report your business as accomplished, and claim your pay. For myself, I shall disappear from this place to-morrow, for my arrangements to depart are already completed. I shall leave no clue behind me by which I can be traced, so you need have no fear of betrayal."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon ami,</foreign> you are a good fellow, and I am sorry I undertook to kill you; and I'm glad too, for it gives us double pay for not killing you. Hand over the money, comrade, and pass on."</p> 
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6349-00000148"/> 
               <p>"But you will be sure to leave at once?" said Jacques, suspiciously.</p> 
               <p>"A week hence inquire for me here, and no man will be able to tell whither I have gone," coldly replied Rudolph. "Here is the pocket-book; it has memoranda in my own writing which will prove its ownership to her to whom it will be taken. Resume your weapons, and go; I wish to be alone."</p> 
               <p>The men obeyed his imperious gesture, and in a few moments disappeared among the trees. Pierre whispered to his companion:</p> 
               <p>"I say, Jacques, we are well out of this job, for that fellow would have proved a tough customer. He sprang upon us with the bound of a tiger, and faced us with the courage of a lion. He's been used to command men-I know from the sound of his voice."</p> 
               <p>"He commanded you easy enough," was the sneering reply.</p> 
               <p>To which Pierre rejoined:</p> 
               <p>"I think we were in the same box; but it's no use to quarrel now; we've made a better thing of it than if we had killed him."</p> 
               <p>"If he keeps his word; but we should have got the money all the same; for of course we wouldn't have been stupid enough to throw him in the sea without taking all the valuables he had about him."</p> 
               <p>"It's as well as it is, for that fellow would have killed one or perhaps both of us. He's got the sinews and the heart of a man, and he wouldn't die easy, I can tell you."</p> 
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Ta, ta," gabbler, that's enough. If he don't keep his word, I'll find means to settle with him yet."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph sat down upon the bench they had left, covered his face with his hands, and his strong frame was shaken with the emotions that assailed him. Alina had kept her word! The threats which he believed were wrung from her in a moment of overwhelming suffering had taken a tangible form, and she had actually caused assassins to attempt his life. There was bitter anguish even yet, in the thought that she could be so lost, so fallen from her womanhood. He recalled her as the young, pure girl he had loved so long and well, and tears of agony rained upon his breast. He had believed the past was dead to him, but it rose up now in all its power, and his brief dream of wedded love and confidence came back to torture him anew.</p> 
               <p>He mourned for her; he prayed in bitterness of spirit that she might be turned from the evil path on which she had entered; and at length, calmed through exhaustion, he arose, and slowly went back to his lodgings.</p> 
               <p>It had been his fixed purpose to give up mercantile life; its details wearied and annoyed him, and he had steadily made his arrangements to leave Havre, and go-he cared not whither. All places were alike to him now; his path lay in the dust and ashes of dead hopes, and it was of little import whither it might lead him. His money had already been transferred to a banking-house in Paris, the head of which had become known to him in Havre; and with a few hundred francs for present expenses, he was ready to plunge into the obscurity which was now his only safety. He did not fear an open enemy, but who could guard himself against the assassin's dagger? His life was of too little value to himself to be constantly guarded, but it might yet be made useful to others, and he would seek a new sphere, in which such talents as he possessed could find a theatre of action.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning he settled with his landlady, tied up a change of linen in his handkerchief, and walked away from the town. Accustomed to an active life, he did not slacken his pace for many hours; the shadows cast by<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6349-00000149"/> the trees upon the road began to lengthen when he at length stopped at a cottage and asked for bread and milk, for which he paid a few sous, and sat down in the yard to satisfy his hunger. The woman who brought them to him eyed him with curiosity, and presently asked:</p> 
               <p>"Are you one of the men that's after the leopard that's got loose from his keeper?"</p> 
               <p>"I am only a traveler, Dame; but what of this leopard? for if one is loose about here, I must be on my guard."</p> 
               <p>"There's been a fair in one of the villages, and there was a show of wild beasts. As they were traveling this way, the leopard, which is a vicious creature, they say, got out of his cage in some way, and made his escape. Two men were here this morning, inquiring about him, and I thought you might be another of 'em."</p> 
               <p>"No, I do not belong to the caravan, but I am glad you spoke of this, for I must be prepared for an encounter with the animal, if we should chance to meet."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, he'll tear you in pieces. He's a terrible beast I am told; and I've been afraid to come out of my cottage all the morning till you came, for my husband would go to hunt him, in spite of all I could say against it."</p> 
               <p>"I should like to join the hunters too. In which direction did they go?"</p> 
               <p>The woman pointed to a thick woodland, and said:</p> 
               <p>"They thought he might hide himself there, but they've had time enough to scour the whole forest since they went away. You'd better stay here till my husband comes back."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you. I am tired with my long walk, and with your permission, I will rest here awhile."</p> 
               <p>The woman brought her wheel to the door, and began to spin busily, occasionally casting an anxious eye toward the forest, and pausing in her work to listen for some sounds that might indicate the return of the hunters. At length Rudolph asked:</p> 
                
               <p>"Is there a chateau beyond the woodland?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes-and a fine fright Madame St. Angeau will be in, if she hears of this fierce creature being loose, for monsieur is not at home, and she and her little girl are alone with the servants."</p> 
               <p>"I fancy they will be sufficient to protect them," said Rudolph, and for half an hour no sound was heard save the monotonous humming of the wheel, and the flax passed rapidly and steadily through the skillful fingers of the spinner. Then a heavy step was heard approaching, the gate opened, and a peasant in a blouse came toward the cottage. He seemed fatigued and disappointed, but he greeted the stranger with the politeness natural to his countrymen.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Franois, have you found the wild beast?" asked his wife.</p> 
               <p>"No, we've had our chase for nothing. At last we found some tracks which made the men think he has turned northward. I don't believe he's anywhere about here."</p> 
               <p>"And did Madame St. Angeau hear of his being loose?"</p> 
               <p>"No, we thought it best not to alarm her by going near the chateau, after we concluded that the creature had taken another course."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph here arose, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I found your good dame frightened, and remained with her till you came to protect her; but now I must be going on my way. Many thanks for your kindness to the wayfarer;" and touching his hat, he passed out of the little yard, and resumed his journey.</p> 
               <p>He presently came to two roads which diverged-one led toward the woodland, the other was the public thoroughfare. Rudolph hesitated an instant, and then, by an impulse he could not resist, he stepped into the umbrageous path that wound toward the chateau of which the woman had spoken.</p> 
               <p>The sun, by this time, was sinking in the West, and as<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6349-00000150"/> he at length came in sight of the old-fashioned building, its level beams were falling in flashes of flame upon the windows. A moat had once girdled it around, but this was now partially filled up and planted with flowers; and the ruins of the ancient drawbridge were covered with moss and creeping plants.</p> 
               <p>Beyond this lay a broad esplanade shaded by large chestnut trees, beneath which a group was gathered that instantly rivetted his attention. A young woman, of pleasing appearance, sat on a low seat reading, and a child nestled to her side, her dark curls floating over her mother's white robe. A girl in the dress of a peasant sat near them, busy with her needle. The lady must be Madame St. Angeau, but why he came there, or what impelled him to linger near that spot, the wanderer could not have explained. Perhaps it was some lurking fear that the danger of which she was so unconscious, was not past, and he hesitated as to the propriety of leaving his covert, and informing her of the possible vicinity of the formidable animal that was known to be roaming at large.</p> 
               <p>The scene before him seemed like a dream of Arcadia. The sylvan beauty of the landscape, the young mother, with her hand toying with the tresses of her child as she read, and the sweet peace that rested on her features, had an inexpressible charm for the shipwrecked man who looked upon her. A soothing calm seemed to fall upon his heart as he sat behind his screen of leaves, and watched the group.</p> 
               <p>His eye and ear were very quick, from his long practice in partisan warfare; and Rudolph had remained thus but a few moments, when a motion among the leaves of the tree a few yards from that under which Madame St. Angeau sat, attracted his attention. He soon distinguished a dark, lithe form, whose brown fur was mottled with white spots, stealthily creeping forward, and making ready for a spring on those below.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph knew that he had come in time to do battle with the leopard, but his presence of mind did not desert him. He knew that on his skill and courage the life of at least one of those before him depended; and he firmly grasped one of his pistols, and placed the other where he could grasp it without an instant's delay. He then crept forward that he might be near enough to render his aim unerring.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly the girl discovered the animal-uttered a loud cry and started to fly. Madame St. Angeau arose precipitately, saw the armed stranger, who at that moment showed himself, and she thought he was the cause of the servants' alarm. She attempted to retreat, but by this time the child had caught sight of the leopard poising himself to spring upon her, and she fell back in a paroxysm of helpless fright, entangling her mother's dress in such a manner that she found it impossible to escape.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph never removed his eyes from the animal, but held himself in readiness to act at the right moment; but as the creature sprang toward his intended prey, the crack of his pistol was heard. The ball penetrated the breast of the monster, and he fell a few feet short of his mark; but he instantly arose, and turned with foaming mouth and glaring eyes upon his assailant. Rudolph dropped the discharged weapon, and grasped the other. Coolly taking aim at the inflamed eye of the furious creature, he waited till he was within a few feet of him, and then fired both barrels rapidly into his brain.</p> 
               <p>With a wild howl, the leopard rolled over at his feet, dead; and cool, as if nothing unusual had occurred, Rudolph went forward, lifted the insensible child he had so opportunely saved from a fearful death, and carried her<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6349-00000151"/> into the house, followed by her mother, who could not find words with which to thank him for the inestimable service he had rendered her.</p> 
               <p>Many moments passed in restoring the little girl to consciousness, and on opening her eyes, her first movement was to stretch forth her arms to the stranger who had saved her, and bury her head in his bosom. Inexpressibly touched by this impulsive action, Rudolph clasped her to his heart, and uttered every soothing epithet he could think of.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Monsieur," said the tearful mother, "my little Agla never before caressed a stranger. She usually shrinks from them, but her grateful heart recognizes you as her deliverer. I cannot thank you as I should, for language is inadequate to express my emotions."</p> 
               <p>"Madame, the embrace of this little innocent repays me for all. I feel that the blessing of God has returned to me in permitting me to rescue this child from so terrible a fate."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph had labored, under competent instructors, to gain such command of the French language as to speak it with ease, and his quick ear had enabled him by this time to acquire such a pronunciation as identified him with the people among whom he had cast his lot. Madame St Angeau had no suspicion that he was not a countryman, and she saw from his bearing and manner that he was a gentleman. She said:</p> 
               <p>"Heaven sent you to our rescue, Monsieur; for had not you come at the critical moment, I shudder to think what might have happened."</p> 
               <p>"I truly believe that Providence guided me hither, for I was impelled to come by a presentiment that my presence would be necessary. I stopped at a cottage on the other side of the woodland, and heard there of the escape of the leopard. Your husband's absence, and the possibility that the animal had taken refuge in your grounds, was also spoken of, and when I came to the point from which the roads diverge, I felt that I must come here at least to warn you of the vicinity of the danger. I had scarcely reached the edge of your lawn, when I discovered the creature I have slain making ready for a spring upon your child. The rest you know."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, you are a brave and cool man. You have faced danger before to-day, or you could never have been so prompt in your action. My husband will return to-night, and you must remain here till he can thank you with his own lips for the great service you have rendered us."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph frankly replied:</p> 
               <p>"I am a wanderer upon the face of the earth, Madame, and it is long since the calm sense of peace has visited my heart. This evening when I looked upon the scene of quiet happiness your lawn presented, I felt as if here rest might be found for the storm-tossed stranger. But fate calls me to a far different sphere, and I must go upon my appointed path."</p> 
               <p>"But not until you have seen M. St. Angeau. It grows late; twilight is already gathering, and my husband will never forgive me if I permit the rescuer of our child to leave his roof without partaking of our hospitality."</p> 
               <p>"The little Agla clung to his breast, murmured her childish phrases of endearment and entreaty, and Rudolph was moved by some powerful sympathy to hold her in his strong clasp as if she belonged to him, as if she had already become a portion of his very being.</p> 
               <p>He looked into the large soft eyes that were fearlessly raised to his; they reminded him of Dora Calvert's, and he pressed his lips upon her brow, and said:</p> 
               <p>"The clinging arms of this little child fetter me as bonds<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6349-00000152"/> of steel. I will remain till the morning, Madame, since you so earnestly desire it."</p> 
               <p>Madame St. Angeau expressed her pleasure with much animation. By this time what had occurred had spread over the place, and a group of servants and farm laborers gathered around the body of the leopard.</p> 
               <p>"Let us go out and look upon the creature you so fearlessly slew," said the lady. "My daughter had better see that he is quite dead, that her dreams may not be haunted by him."</p> 
               <p>"Will she have courage to do so, Madame?"</p> 
               <p>"I have striven to make her brave and fearless; she is unlike other children in many respects, and I think it will be best to show him to her."</p> 
               <p>The child clapped her hands.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, let me see him; I wish to see him."</p> 
               <p>The three issued from the house, the little Agla still in Rudolph's arms, and drew near the group on the lawn. They stood aside at their approach, and the animal, lately so strong and powerful, lay supine before them, stretched out at his full length with his deadly fangs glaring from his open mouth, ready to rend the prey on which he was springing when arrested in his fearful career. He was one of the largest of his species, and his skin was beautifully variegated with white spots, with shadings of yellow and pale brown.</p> 
               <p>After surveying him a few moments, Madame St. Angeau said:</p> 
               <p>"Place your hand upon him, my Agla, and see that he can no longer harm you."</p> 
               <p>The child sprang from Rudolph's arms, and fearlessly approached the formidable-looking creature. She passed her small hand over his shining coat, and lisped:</p> 
               <p>"Maman says he cannot hurt me. I am not afraid."</p> 
                
               <p>"Madame," said Rudolph, "your daughter will be worthy, at some future day, to become the wife of a hero."</p> 
               <p>"I shall try to render her equal to such a lot," replied the mother, with her sweet, pensive smile. "I think that women should be reared to possess as much self-possession in the hour of danger as the stronger sex, for they are often fearfully tried. I shall aim to make my daughter equal to any emergency, though at the same time I shall endeavor to cultivate in her all the grace and sweetness that should distinguish the most timid woman. Ah, Monsieur, woful times are preparing for this fated country, and who can foresee what we may yet have to endure?"</p> 
               <p>The first mutterings of the most fearful revolution the world has witnessed had begun to be heard, and Rudolph understood enough of public affairs to feel the force of her words. He replied:</p> 
               <p>"You are right, Madame. Make your child strong and fearless, that she may breast the waves of life in safety."</p> 
               <p>At that moment the approach of a horseman, coming at headlong speed, was heard, and a gentleman galloped to the edge of the lawn, threw himself from his steed, and with an air of great excitement rushed forward. His face was pale, and his eyes distended with fear till they fell upon the lady and child. With an ejaculation of thankfulness, he clasped them in his arms, and presently said in broken tones:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my precious ones, how have you escaped this danger? To whose courage is your safety owing?"</p> 
               <p>"But for this gentleman, who came at the critical moment, we should now be childless, Armand. He slew the leopard, and saved our Agla from death."</p> 
               <p>M. St. Angeau drew near the stranger, held out his hand, and after a pause of deep emotion, said:</p> 
               <p>"Monsieur, you have placed me under a life-long obligation<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6349-00000153"/> tion. All I possess could ill repay the service you have rendered me. When within a few miles of my home, I heard of the men who were in pursuit of this fierce animal; that they had sought him near my chateau, and I rode forward in a fever of apprehension. Through your gallantry I find all safe. Accept my thanks, Monsieur; my friendship, for although I know not even your name, the man who could perform what you have this day done, is, I feel, worthy of the highest estimation."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph warmly grasped his offered hand.</p> 
               <p>"I accept your friendship, M. St. Angeau, and I will prove myself worthy of it. Do not estimate my service too highly, for the performance of it has been a blessing to myself. I needed something to bring me back into communion with my kind, and God has sent me as the deliverer of this charming child, to prove to me that I can yet be of some use on the earth."</p> 
               <p>The penetrating eye of M. St. Angeau scanned the features of the speaker, so youthful, yet so saddened, and he comprehended that no ordinary suffering prompted his words. He cordially said:</p> 
               <p>"I have called my home Tranquilit, and not without good reason, for the spirit of peace and gentleness dwells in it, in the shape of my fair wife. You shall remain with us a season, and feel the blessed influence she spreads around her. Shall it not be so?"</p> 
               <p>"I am a wanderer, without home or place of rest. I accept your invitation as frankly as it is given; a few days will I tarry beneath your roof to refresh my weary soul with the sight of that domestic happiness which, to me, is forever lost. The name I bear is Michel."</p> 
               <p>"Be assured, M. Michel, that we shall detain you as long as possible among us. Let us enter the chateau, for it grows late, and the hour for supper draws near."</p> 
                
               <p>As they turned toward the house, M. St. Angeau lifted the child in his arms, but after kissing him, and prattling to him a moment, she held out her hand to her new friend, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Take me-hold me fast-for I love you."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph clasped her to his breast with a feeling of tenderness which had not visited his heart for many long months. He felt as if this little child was to awake the deadened sympathies of his soul once more, and he was grateful for the flood of sweet and gentle emotions that awoke within him. He had long felt as one walking in a desert, but a new spring of humanity had been touched by the incident of the day, and an oasis sprung up to gladden the life that had been rendered so desolate.</p> 
               <p>The lonely and wounded heart of the wanderer was touched by the kindness with which he was received, and his new friends found means to detain him from day to day, till a bond of affection was formed between them that he found it difficult to break. He found M. St. Angeau to be a man of cultivated tastes, who had seen much of life; he had served a campaign in the army, at the age of thirty had made a love match, and retired to his paternal acres to spend his days in the tranquil pursuits of a country life.</p> 
               <p>This was most congenial to the taste of his wife, for in her home, with her husband and child, surrounded by contented dependents, she found her whole happiness; and the duties of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chatelaine</foreign> were never more gracefully performed than by Madame St. Angeau.</p> 
               <p>The place was well named Tranquilit, for the "peace which passeth show" had taken up its abode within its walls. The little Agla, tenderly and judiciously trained, was the light of this serene household, her happy spirit its brightest sunshine; and this charming infant seemed destined<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6349-00000154"/> tined by Heaven to bring back peace to the stricken spirit of her preserver.</p> 
               <p>She followed him, prattled to him unceasingly, and clung to him with such winning caresses, that it was impossible to resist her sweet willfulness. Day by day, Rudolph might be seen walking to and fro upon the lawn leading Agla by the hand, or carrying her in his arms, and the long vanished smile again came to his lip, the light of affection to his eye.</p> 
               <p>The parents looked on, charmed that she had power to detain their new friend near them, until at least the deep depression, from which he evidently suffered, had passed away; and they felt as if this mission had been confided to their innocent child.</p> 
               <p>The owners of the leopard learned his fate, and came to claim his skin, which had been carefully preserved; but this M. St. Angeau wished to retain as a trophy; and he satisfied them by paying them a sufficient sum to enable him to do so.</p> 
               <p>When Rudolph spoke of leaving the chateau, he was so vehemently opposed, so many reasons were given for prolonging his stay, that it seemed churlish to insist. A pleasant circle frequently assembled around them, and hunting and fishing varied the monotony of a country life; and in reckless riding, and the use of the shot gun, the stranger soon proved himself superior to those he was thrown among.</p> 
               <p>His host had a great desire to gain some knowledge of his previous life, but Rudolph carefully guarded the secret of his nationality, and passed among them for a Frenchman from the borders of the Rhine. As he also spoke German with fluency, this was more readily believed.</p> 
               <p>Summer deepened into Autumn, and still he lingered, charmed and solaced by the friendly cares that surrounded him; but when the leaves began to fall, he felt that he must go forth again, strengthened for the battle of life that lay before him by this interval of repose. But he pledged himself to return again; his little love, as he called Algae, should not be deserted by her chosen knight.</p> 
               <p>Madame St. Angeau, who had considerable talent for painting, insisted on taking a likeness of him before he left, as a memorial for her daughter, as she wished the features of one who had so vitally served her to be vividly remembered by her child. She succeeded in obtaining a striking resemblance, and the picture was framed, and, at her own request, hung at the foot of Agla's bed; and in her nightly prayers, the sweet child raised her clasped hands towards the image of her friend, and asked God to remember him in his wanderings. Rudolph parted from her with many caresses, bade adieu to his friends, and turned his steps toward Paris, as there his funds were placed, and at that point he could more readily gain such information as would enable him to volunteer in that portion of the army which was engaged in active service.</p> 
               <p>To pursue his military career was his fixed purpose; but without family or fortune, he felt that he must again enter the ranks, and by his gallantry and daring win his way upward, as he had before done in his native land.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE LEOPARDESS ON THE TRACK.</head> 
               <p>AS the time for Helen's marriage drew near, Mrs. Fitzhugh returned to London, and preparations were made for celebrating it in a Catholic chapel situated near their hotel.<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6349-00000155"/> On the evening before the appointed day, Sir Reginald made his appearance, looking much excited and harassed. He asked for a private interview with Mrs. Fitzhugh, and at once laid before her a letter which had been delivered to him on his arrival in town.</p> 
               <p>It was from Alina, and in it she announced the birth of a son; who she claimed to be the legitimate heir of his father. She asserted her intention at some future day to contest the right of Sir Reginald to succeed his brother, and take possession of his inheritance.</p> 
               <p>A certificate of the infant's birth was furnished by the physician who had attended her, and also that of his baptism by a dignitary of the Catholic church. He had received the name of Lionel De Vere, and Alina stated her intention to struggle to the bitter end for his right, not only to bear it, but to succeed to his father's estates. She ended:</p> 
               <p>"As a Catholic, Sir Reginald, you cannot recognise the validity of my first marriage, performed as the ceremony was, by a man who really had no authority to exercise the priestly functions. The civil contract, to those of the only true faith, has no significance, and if you are an honorable and true son of the church, you will acknowledge that my son is the heir of your brother. As such I put forth his claims, and I demand that they shall be recognised. If they are not, I shall find means to enforce them."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh read this communication in silent consternation. She said:</p> 
               <p>"Alina is mad to write such a letter as this to you. She must be aware that in England the legitimacy of this child will never be recognized. She only seeks to annoy you, that you may increase the annuity you have granted her."</p> 
               <p>"I am quite ready to do that; I will double the sum, and assume the expenses of the boy's education when he is old enough to receive one; but I can do no more. As to the validity of the first marriage I shall not judge, but I am Christian enough not to recognise the right of a wife, wedded by any legal form, to forsake her husband. The laws of England sufficiently protect me from disturbance through this absurd claim, but it is painful to me that it should be put forward just at this crisis."</p> 
               <p>"Alina detests her cousin, and she has purposely reserved this blow for the eve of your marriage. I am afraid the existence of this child will place it in her power to annoy you in the future, for my niece is a most persistent person in whatever she undertakes, and if she can bring unhappiness into your household, I am sorry to say she will spare no effort to do so."</p> 
               <p>"I think I can defy her there," replied De Vere, with an assured smile. "She can establish no influence over either Helen or myself, and malicious interference I will never tolerate from any one. This unhappy woman has evidently deluded herself into the belief that I am fanatic enough to take the same view of her position which she and my brother chose to assume; but I recognise the law of the land in which I live as supreme. She will doubtless say that in this I am guided by my own interests, but it matters little to me what her opinion may be. I shall do what I consider right, and submit my motives of action to a higher tribunal."</p> 
               <p>"As I before said, I think Alina only desires money, for she must know that the claim she sets up for her child is inadmissible. Write, and state to her what you are willing to do, and I am certain that your proposed liberality will effectually silence her pretensions."</p> 
               <p>"I trust that it may have that effect, for I cannot bear that this story shall be blazoned abroad, and become the parent of a thousand unpleasant rumors. For her own sake,<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6349-00000156"/> I should think Madam Derval would shrink from such publicity as the prosecution of this ridiculous claim must incur."</p> 
               <p>"Alina shrinks from nothing, I am afraid. She is a bold, unscrupulous woman, reckless of consequences if she can carry out her plans. Her present aim is to cast an envenomed shaft at Helen on the eve of her marriage, for she can never be serious in claiming that her son is really the heir to the title and estate."</p> 
               <p>"Helen need know nothing of it; I will shield her from this piece of malice by concealing it from her. I will write and settle the affair at once."</p> 
               <p>He sat down and dashed off the following lines:</p> 
               <q>

                           <p>"MADAME DERVAL:-Your letter has reached me, containing the notification of the birth of your son, and also the extraordinary claim you put forward for him. That it is untenable you must be as well aware as I am, for the scriptures say, 'whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.'</p> 
                           <p>"You were united to your husband by one who spoke in the name of Jehovah, and you then recognized his right to perform the sacrament of marriage. Passion and sophistry led you to repudiate that right, but in the eyes of every just man it is indisputable. Nothing can now legitimate your child. The bar sinister would prevent his accession to his father's estate, even if I did not stand in his path. I am willing and anxious to do all that lies in my power for this unhappy child; but I can never acknowledge him as the heir of my brother.</p> 
                           <p>"It is my purpose to double the annuity I now allow you, and I will also charge myself with the future education of your son. More than this I neither can nor will do, and I counsel you to permit your unhappy history to remain in obscurity. Your present position is respectable, and you will certainly forfeit it if you attempt to prosecute a claim which is utterly untenable.</p> 
                           <p>"I am not a man to be trifled with, and I warn you that any attempt to interfere in my domestic affairs will be promptly punished by the withdrawal of your income. I am aware of the cause of the hostility you cherish toward my intended wife, and I hold her blameless in intention. The consequences that flowed from her wilful act could never have been foreseen by her, and they have been bitterly lamented. I hope you perfectly comprehend me, and that you will be aided by your own sense of right to see the justice of my decision.</p>

               <p>This was sealed and addressed at once, and then the lover asked:</p> 
               <p>"How did Helen bear the journey to town; I trust she is quite well."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-and very happy, though a little nervous at the thought of to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"I wish I could see her a moment; but it is contrary to etiquette, I suppose, so I will not insist. A few more hours, and she will be all my own. We will travel into Wales, and there, in a charming cottage I have secured, spend the first halcyon days of our union. In a few weeks, we shall return to Vere Castle, and you, dear Madam, must be there to welcome us. Your apartments are ready for you, and henceforth you will consider yourself one of our family. She who has been so true a mother to my Helen, shall ever be regarded as one by me."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, dear Reginald. Helen is the child of my heart, and I could not be happy if separated from her. I have promised to visit some old friends during your bridal tour, but I shall be at the Castle in time to receive you."</p> 
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6349-00000157"/> 
               <p>Leaving many messages for Helen, De Vere soon afterward departed, and Mrs. Fitzhugh went at once to her daughter's apartment. To her dismay, she found Helen weeping as if her heart would break. An open letter lay on the table beside her, and a box with the cover thrown carelessly over it, was lying at her feet.</p> 
               <p>"What has happened? What on earth is the matter with you?" asked Mrs. Fitzhugh, in alarm.</p> 
               <p>"Read this, and then look into that box and see what a bridal gift Alina has dared to send me."</p> 
               <p>In deep indignation, Mrs. Fitzhugh read the lines addressed to Helen on the eve of her marriage:</p> 
               <q>

                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"HELEN:-This letter will come to you when you have reached the topmost wave of the prosperity your treachery toward me enabled you to gain; yet beware! the cup is often dashed from the lip when it seems brimming over with happiness. Its contents you may taste-for that I am powerless to prevent-but the gall of bitterness and repentance shall yet mingle with the draught.</p> 
                           <p>"You shall not hug to your soul the triumphant thought that for you is the glitter and sparkle of life-for me its shame and humiliation. I have declared undying hostility to you, and I here repeat my vow. Know that I am the mother of the true heir of Vere Castle; a son has been given to me, and if there is justice on earth, he will yet succeed to the inheritance of his father. No child of <emph>yours</emph> shall supercede him; I have sworn it, and I will keep my word.</p> 
                           <p>"Lull yourself into what security you may, listen credulously as you choose to the tender voice of him who will assure you of his power to protect you against me, but I shall yet find and strike you in your happiness. Be assured of this, and every hour, every day of your life look for the blow which shall reach a vital point, or my hand will fail of its cunning.</p> 
                           <p>"I send you a bridal robe, the most fitting for such as you to wear, though I have no idea that you will honor me by appearing in it on the auspicious occasion. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">N'importe;</foreign> keep it till anguish rends your heart, and then, perhaps, you will see its fitness for one who should do penance all her life for the base wrong she committed against her kinswoman.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh dropped the letter, and throwing back the top of the box, lifted a robe of black serge, embroidered with frightful devices, representing the punishment of souls in purgatory. It was evidently made in imitation of those worn in past days by heretics condemned to expiate their sins by death at the funeral pyre, though the figures on this were made ingeniously to tell the cause of feud between the cousins, and to foreshadow its future punishment.</p> 
               <p>"This is too great an outrage," said Mrs. Fitzhugh, indignantly. "Why did you open the box at all, my dear? You must have known that its contents would annoy you."</p> 
               <p>"It arrived before the letter reached me, and my maid opened it in the belief that it was Parisian millinery, which has been ordered from Madame Herbaux. For a few minutes I was at a loss to know who could have insulted me thus, but Alina's letter was brought in, and I understood all her malignity. Oh, mother, this has made me very miserable, for I feel that my cousin's hostility will work me woe yet."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, my dear; Alina can only threaten; she has no power to perform. She has also written to Sir Reginald, informing him of the birth of her son, and claiming for him the succession to the estate. She is only baffled, and furious, and she seeks every means to annoy you. Cheer<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6349-00000158"/> up, my love, for there is no danger that Alina can interfere in any way with your happiness."</p> 
               <p>"And what did Reginald say when he heard of the boy?" anxiously asked Helen.</p> 
               <p>"He said what became him as a gentleman, and a good man; that he would provide for the child, and increase the annuity he allows his mother. He wrote to her at once, and showed her the true position she holds. Moreover, he threatened her with a withdrawal of her annuity if any attempt is made to render you unhappy. Alina is mercenary, and extravagant; she has sense enough to see where her true interest lies, and we shall hear no more of her or her son's pretensions; be sure of that."</p> 
               <p>"Dear Reginald! he is so good, so noble, so considerate for my happiness. How can I ever reward him for all his kindness?"</p> 
               <p>"By being the best and happiest little wife in the world, to be sure. In what better way could you hope to reward him?"</p> 
               <p>"The first I will try to be; the last I shall surely be, if this evil influence can only be removed from my life. But what shall I do with this robe?"</p> 
               <p>"Send it back to the giver, of course. Alina has much more cause to wear it than you, my love; and I shall tell her as much. But I will wait till after the wedding, that I may return it in the name of Lady De Vere. Reginald did not wish you to learn anything of the existence of this child, and the new annoyance to which he has been subjected, but Alina took her own precautions to have it made known to you. Such hatred as hers will not be baffled."</p> 
               <p>"Alas! that is what I fear," said Helen, sorrowfully. "When Alina remembers that my father was truly one to her, I do not know how she can thus persecute me. Gratitude tude for his kindness should shield me from her, even if I have unfortunately given her cause of anger.</p> 
               <p>"My child, your cousin has no sentiment of any kind. Her mind is as hard, clear, and brilliant as the diamond, which cuts through the hardest substance; but like that gem, she needs a good setting, and the money which is dependent on her good behavior, will have more weight with her than all your father did for her. After she reads Sir Reginald's letter, she will leave you in peace, rest assured of that."</p> 
               <p>"I would that I could only think so; but time alone can convince me that she has no power to harm me."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh ordered the box to be taken to her own apartment, with the intention of returning it to Paris on the following evening.</p> 
               <p>The bridal day dawned clear and brilliant, and at an early hour the few friends who had been invited to attend the ceremony arrived. Helen, though pale and tremulous, looked very lovely in her lace and orange blossoms. She had scarcely slept during the previous night, and the only slumber she had fallen into was broken by a frightful dream of Alina as a Gorgon, followed by the demons she had caused to be wrought upon the robe of serge, coming to tear her from the very altar. She awoke, palpitating with alarm, and for the remainder of the night, sleep was effectually driven from her pillow.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, my sweet blush rose, you have become as white as a lily," whispered De Vere, "but the mountain air will soon bring back the roses to your cheeks again. I hope you are not grieving that you must leave your mother to go with me."</p> 
               <p>The quick flush that leaped to her cheek, and the soft glance of the eyes that were shyly raised an instant to his own, replied to him even without the words she breathed, though they were ineffably precious to him."</p> 
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6349-00000159"/> 
               <p>"No, no, with you, always with you, shall I find peace and strength."</p> 
               <p>He pressed her hand tenderly, and placed her in the carriage which awaited them. In a few moments they were whirled to the door of the chapel where everything had been prepared for their reception. After the usual preliminaries had been attended to, the bridal pair, with their two attendants, placed themselves before the altar. The service was half completed when a voice arose from the midst of a crowd of people who had straggled in on learning that a marriage was being celebrated, and, in shrill tones, exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"She's no match for him. Let her go back and put on her robe of penitence. That is most suited to her on this day."</p> 
               <p>The woman who uttered these words was wrapped in a heavy shawl, and a thick veil concealed her features. They were no sooner spoken than she evaded those who attempted to detain her, and succeeded in leaving the church.</p> 
               <p>Helen, half fainting, clung to the arm of De Vere, and the priest paused in astonishment. He then bent forward, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Is there any impediment, Sir Reginald, which can lawfully prevent me from proceeding?"</p> 
               <p>"None, so help me Heaven!" he emphatically replied. "The woman is mad, or moved by some feeling of malice which I scarcely comprehend. Go on without delay."</p> 
               <p>The priest had known him from his boyhood, and he felt assured that in every circumstance of life, under every temptation, Sir Reginald De Vere would speak the truth; he therefore completed the service as if nothing had occurred to interrupt it.</p> 
               <p>Helen recognized the source from which this insult came, and she was so overcome with emotion that De Vere had almost to carry her in his arms to the carriage. When they were again alone, he asked:</p> 
                
               <p>"Have you any clue to what occurred in the chapel, Helen? It was a most wanton and shameless insult, and if I could discover its perpetrator I would deal very summarily with her."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, do not ask me, Reginald, for you will feel that I have brought annoyance of every kind to you when you are apprised of the truth."</p> 
               <p>"I can only feel that you have made me the happiest of men, my precious Helen. You know that you are the soul of candor, and for that I love you, so speak out and unravel this mystery."</p> 
               <p>"I wished to conceal the malice of my cousin from you, but she has rendered it impossible. The woman who spoke in the chapel was, doubtless, sent by her for that purpose; for she has sent me a most shameful bridal present, which my mother undertook to return to her."</p> 
               <p>"A robe of penitence I suppose from the woman's words. She had better take care, for now she has not a feeble girl to deal with; but a man who will protect his own at all hazards. Where is this garment, Helen?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh! it is packed up to be returned, I would not have you see it on any account, for it is the most frightful thing you ever looked on."</p> 
               <p>"Well, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ptite,</foreign> I'll not insist. You can describe to me the fanciful devices with which it is doubtless adorned, and that shall suffice. It is her last insult, Helen; for, now that a strong arm has thrown its shield over your fate, Alina will fear to cast her envenomed darts at you. Dismiss all fear of her, my sweet love, for I possess the power to keep this vengeful spirit in due bounds."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I hope so; but I tremble in spite of my better reason, when I think of my cousin's threats."</p> 
               <p>"They are but breath, breath Helen, foolishly expended. Do not permit your bridal day to be clouded by them,-cling to me-trust me, and I will protect you from evil."</p> 
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6349-00000160"/> 
               <p>"I do-I will," and the traveling carriage rolled onward bearing two happy hearts toward the exquisite seclusion De Vere had secured for this happy season of his life.</p> 
               <p>A cottage in the valley of Llanghollan, embowered in roses and shaded by venerable oaks, received them; and there the Eden of our first parents seemed renewed to the two who wandered together through the glades, or sailed upon the stream near their dwelling, never weary of each other, but daily discovering some new trait to appreciate and admire. They regretted the approach of the time appointed for their return to the world; but a large party was expected at Vere Castle, to celebrate their marriage, and they must be there in time to receive them.</p> 
               <p>With many regrets the lovers bade adieu to their sylvan paradise, and on the appointed evening reached the domain around the castle. They found the tenantry assembled to welcome their landlord and his fair bride, and the children threw flowers upon her as she passed; the people cheered, and the marriage bells rang out their merriest peal.</p> 
               <p>The carriage wound through a stately avenue toward a heavy pile of Tudor architecture, which for centuries had been the home of the De Veres. A modern wing had been added to the mansion, and in this the apartments of Helen were situated. On the threshold she was met by her mother, and joyful was the reunion between them. She raised her head from her bosom to receive the congratulations of other friends who had gathered there to welcome her to her new home.</p> 
               <p>The lawn was covered with tables at which the tenantry were feasted, and Sir Reginald walked among them with his smiling bride hanging on his arm, that they might see the mistress he had brought to reign over his ancient home. Blessings followed them wherever they moved, and Helen was touched by the simple eloquence of more than one of those uncultivated people.</p> 
                
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh returned the robe to Alina with the following note:</p>

                           <p>"Helen is now the wife of Sir Reginald De Vere; she is happy, and her husband is competent to protect her against all your machinations. I advise you to be circumspect in your course toward him, or you will lose everything. He will be a good friend to your son if you leave his future to his generosity, for only from that can you hope for anything.</p> 
                           <p>"The idle claim you set forward, you must be aware, can never be brought to any issue to you but disgrace and defeat. The indignity you have put on Helen it will be best not to attempt to repeat, for De Vere will resent an insult to her in such a manner as will most sensibly touch a mercenary woman like yourself.</p> 
                           <p>"I can no longer sign myself, as I once did, your affectionate Aunt, for your late conduct has effectually destroyed the regard I once felt for you. Oh, Alina! repent before it is too late, and return to the path of honor you seem to have abandoned.</p>

               <p>Alina received this letter a few hours after that of Sir Reginald had reached her. That had aroused intense anger, and this filled the measure of her rage. She was seated in a luxurious apartment, in which every object that could charm the eye, or gratify the sense of the beautiful, had been collected, regardless of expense.</p> 
               <p>The cradle of her infant, shaded by rose-colored curtains, draped with fine lace, stood near her, and in it slumbered the boy she had vowed to elevate to the station once occupied by his father. He bore upon his baby features the stamp of his lineage, for the clearly-defined profile, the dark eyebrows, and raven curls that lay in soft rings upon his forehead, presented a miniature copy of Sir Lionel De Vere.<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6349-00000161"/> Alina looked down upon him, but the cloud did not leave her brow, nor the sternness her lip, as she muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Disenherited, cast off as you are, my child, you shall yet sit in the castle of your fathers, lord of all. <emph>They</emph> think to baffle me; to buy me off with this paltry annuity, which they even threaten to withdraw if I persist in upholding your rights. Well, they shall yet find that I will prove more than a match for them all. I can watch, and wait, and subtly pursue my plans, while they cradle themselves in security. <emph>Lady De Vere!</emph> ha! ha! your heart shall yet be wrung with anguish by the vengeance I will take upon you."</p> 
               <p>Betty, the maid who had accompanied her from America, came in to see if the infant needed anything; and Alina watched her as she bent over the child, and arranged his pillow anew. This woman was dull and common-place, but she possessed one strong instinct-a passionate fondness for children; and for this beautiful boy she had already conceived an attachment of far deeper strength than that felt for him by his scheming mother.</p> 
               <p>Alina encouraged this by throwing much of the care of her son upon her, for through the fanatical fondness of this untutored heart, she saw her way to the accomplishment of the wickedness that dimly loomed before her in the future. She comprehended the nature she had to deal with, and believed she could work out her plans with the aid she confidently relied on from a being of such imperfect ideas of right as Betty possessed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND.</head> 
               <p>THE funds of Rudolph had been placed in the banking-house of Rodrigues, Hortaling &amp; Co., of which one of the most remarkable men of his day was the principal, Beaumarchais, the author of the Barber of Seville, and the firm and consistent friend of American freedom. To the efforts of this man the independence of the United States is due, more than to any other Frenchman. He it was who pressed upon the ministers of Louis XVI. the necessity of assisting the revolted colonies; he was permitted secretly to furnish them with arms taken from the arsenals of France; and he fitted out ships at his own expense, to bring them to those who stood in perishing need of them. But for his efforts, England might yet rule over the Southern, as she does over the Northern portion of this continent. Rudolph was aware of Beaumarchais' efforts to serve his country, and he had eagerly sought opportunity to converse with him when he had accidentally been thrown with him in Havre. He found him a man of enlarged views, great enthusiasm of character and unflinching courage. Such a man had great attraction for him, and he had transferred his money to his banking-house that he might have an opportunity to see Beaumarchais again.</p> 
               <p>On arriving in Paris, he sought his place of business, but was told that the chief was not within. On inquiring where he might be found, his private address was given, but the clerk said that the most probable place to find M. Beaumarchais was under the shadow of the Bastile, near which gloomy prison he was building himself a house, which he intended to rival Aladdin's palace.</p> 
               <p>The Bastile! it had a thousand dreary and frightful associations<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6349-00000162"/> ciations in the mind of the lover of freedom; but it was a salient point in the city of Paris, and was easily found even by a stranger. Rudolph soon stood beneath its gloomy walls, and after surveying them, he easily discovered the spot on which Beaumarchais was erecting a fairy temple at a fabulous cost, which Napoleon afterwards called his folly.</p> 
               <p>In the space of an acre of ground, temples, grottoes, and winding walks were erected in the busy heart of the city, of which no vestige now remains. The vanity of the author of so many successful works as Beaumarchais had written, induced him to believe that he would also bequeath to the world a lasting monument of his architectural skill.</p> 
               <p>As the clerk had foretold, the banker was on the spot with book and pencil, giving directions to his workmen, and devising new plans for the embellishment of his miniature grounds. All was confusion around him, but out of this chaos was to arise a vision of taste and beauty which, for a few brief years, was the wonder of his giddy countrymen; a home of dreariness and vexation to its owner during the revolutionary days which were rapidly approaching, and was finally swept away before the new order of things, as if a veritable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chateau en Espagne</foreign> had arisen and melted away before one's eyes.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph approached the tree under which Beaumarchais was standing, and examined him at his leisure; for his attention was too much engrossed by the paper before him, on which he was sketching a plan, to observe the vicinity of a stranger.</p> 
               <p>The slender and elegant figure which had produced so great a sensation among the courtly dames when he was first introduced at Versailles, had lost the graceful porportions which then distinguished them, but his lofty stature and dignified bearing showed him to be a man of mark. His features were regular and expressive, and his dark eyes beamed with all their early fire, although the raven locks that once played around his stately brow were now mixed with silver.</p> 
               <p>Beaumarchais was a deeply interesting study to Rudolph, for here was a man, humbly born, who by the force of his own energy and talent had raised himself from the condition of a watch-maker, to become the companion and counsellor of princes; the architect of an immense fortune; and last, though by no means least in his estimation, the ardent and consistent friend of his struggling country.</p> 
               <p>Presently a workman came to him for orders; they were rapidly and clearly given, and as the man turned away the eye of Beaumarchais fell upon the stranger. Rudolph advanced, bowed, and respectfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I have the honor to recall myself to your memory, Monsieur Beaumarchais. We met last winter in Havre, and I have opened an account with your house. I have already visited your place of business, and was told to seek you here if I wished a personal interview."</p> 
               <p>"Where the heart is, the body is very apt to be found," replied Beaumarchais, with his animated smile. "I remember you perfectly, M. Michel, and I am glad to meet you just now. I find that I shall have some difficulty in settling my claims against your countrymen, and I shall be glad to gain some information which you can probably give me."</p> 
               <p>"All I can give is at your service," replied Rudolph. "To the man who so opportunely sent aid to a people struggling for their freedom, everything is due. Command me, Monsieur."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you; come and dine with me without ceremony at four. Here is my address; my mind is now occupied with the business before me, but when we meet again I shall be ready for you."</p> 
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6349-00000163"/> 
               <p>An invitation to dine <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en famille</foreign> with so distinguished a man as Beaumarchais, was no slight honor in the estimation of him who received it, and Rudolph promised to be punctual to the hour named. Beaumarchais added:</p> 
               <p>"When dinner is over, and our discussion is ended, if you feel inclined to accompany me, we will go together to witness the performance of one of my pieces at which I have promised to be present."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you-that will indeed be a pleasure I was far from anticipating. I shall esteem myself honored in sitting beside the author of the Barber of Seville when one of his own pieces is acted."</p> 
               <p>The brilliant smile of Beaumarchais flashed over his mobile lips, and he said, with a half sigh:</p> 
               <p>"Alas, my young friend, the old magician has almost lost his spell, but the sight of your enthusiasm may bring back some of his early fire, and brighten him up for the works he has now in hand. The literature of your country has yet to be created, therefore your taste must be fresh and unpolluted by prejudice. I shall like to witness the effect this piece will have upon you. It hits hard at abuses, that must be corrected before this nation can emerge from the thraldom in which it is held, and the spirit in which it has been received by my countrymen, proves that they are fully alive to the necessity of a reform."</p> 
               <p>"The country indeed seems on the eve of a great struggle, but I trust it will be a bloodless one."</p> 
               <p>"Doubtless, my young friend. The French nation is too great, too noble to rush into a civil war. That is the direst calamity that could befall us."</p> 
               <p>The speaker seemed to have forgotten his employment, but at that moment a workman approached and made some inquiry of him that must be replied to immediately. Rudolph bowed and said:</p> 
                
               <p>"I will no longer interrupt you, Monsieur. At four you may expect me," and he walked away to occupy the time in wandering through the city till the hour of his visit drew near.</p> 
               <p>He entered a caf, opposite the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Comedie Francaise,</foreign> to order lunch; he afterwards learned that this was the caf de Procope to which the theatrical critics of the day resorted to pronounce judgment on such new pieces as were brought out. To this house Voltaire had once gone in the disguise of an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Abb</foreign> to listen to the criticisms on his Semiramis. In the dull and dimly-lighted room a small knot of speakers were now eagerly discussing the Marriage of Figaro. Rudolph listened with interest, and learned that the King had positively prohibited the performance of a piece which struck at the privileged classes, ridiculed the parliament, and exposed the tyranny of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">lettres de cachet.</foreign> After unheard-of difficulties, and the supervision of five censors of the press, the indefatigable author had at last succeeded in getting the Marriage of Figaro put upon the stage.</p> 
               <p>This triumph was achieved, however, through the overwhelming curiosity of the people to witness the performance of a comedy, which had already been represented in private with signal success. The King at last yielded, through the fear that its suppression would be more be more injurious to the Court than its performance, and the people of Paris crowded nightly to the theatre to see the cherished abuses of the government made ridiculous.</p> 
               <p>This would be the fiftieth night of its representation, and public interest was still unsated. Congratulating himself on the opportunity of being present in the company of its author, Rudolph, having discussed his lunch, arose and left the house.</p> 
               <p>A few minutes before four, a cab set him down at the door<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6349-00000164"/> of M. Beaumarchais, and he was immediately ushered into an elegantly-furnished saloon, in which he found his host in the company of his wife and daughter, the latter as yet a child in years. After introducing him to these ladies, Beaumarchais drew him into a recess, and until dinner was announced eagerly discussed his claims on the American government, and the chances of having them speedily liquidated.</p> 
               <p>As to the last, Rudolph could afford him little information, but he described to him the resources of the country and the character of the people. When he finished, Beaumarchais cheerfully said:</p> 
               <p>"All will eventually be safe then, Monsieur. Such a nation as yours will never repudiate a debt contracted as this has been."</p> 
               <p>At that moment dinner was announced, and motioning his guest to take in his wife, the old man drew the arm of his daughter within his own and placed her near himself at the table. The dinner was elegant and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">recherch,</foreign> but the genial manner and sparkling wit of the host gave it its greatest charm.</p> 
               <p>"Papa," asked the little Eugenia, "what will you do with all the money you will make from Figaro?"</p> 
               <p>"Do with it, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma ptite?</foreign> Something good-something noble, for it is my own money, made by the sweat of my brain, and I have the right to use it as I will."</p> 
               <p>"You will give it to a charity then?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my darling-I intend to found a charity for the benefit of poor nursing mothers, who have to work out for a living. I intend to provide a comfortable place where their children can be taken care of while they are away from them. What do you say to that?"</p> 
               <p>The little girl clapped her hands:</p> 
               <p>"It is charming-ah, you are the best of men, my papa."</p> 
               <p>Beaumarchais regarded her with a droll smile.</p> 
                
               <p>"I am afraid that not many would agree with you in that opinion, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma ptite,</foreign> for I am the best abused of men. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">N'importe,</foreign> I do the best I can, and leave the babblers to their talk; it concerns me very little. Madame, if you and my daughter accompany us to the theatre to-night, it is time you were getting ready."</p> 
               <p>Madame Beaumarchais arose and left the room, accompanied by Eugenia. Her husband explained that his family had seen the piece performed many times, but they attended on this night because the actors gave the receipts to the charity he intended to found.</p> 
               <p>In a short time the carriage was at the door, and the party was rapidly whirled toward the Comedie Francaise; a private box, with a lattice in front, was appropriated to the author, as his presence, if known, would have produced a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">furore</foreign> of applause which he was desirous to avoid.</p> 
               <p>On their arrival they learned that the Court had returned from Versailles, and at a late hour, the King and Queen had signified their intention of being present at the performance. This was an honor which Beaumarchais sensibly felt, and as soon as they were seated he turned to his guest, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I am happy, Monsieur, that I brought you with me, for you will have an opportunity to see our good King and our beautiful and gracious Queen. You will soon see the Court enter the royal box."</p> 
               <p>In fact, while he was speaking, the national air was struck up, and cries of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Vive le Roi, Vive la Reine,</foreign> were heard. In a few moments, a good-natured, heavy-looking man, wearing the cross of St Louis upon his breast, led in a lady whose majesty of deportment, tempered by graceful sweetness of expression, proclaimed the Queen. Maria Antoinette was then in the flower of her youth and loveliness. Her form was exquisitely proportioned, and her hands<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6349-00000165"/> and arms were of marvellous beauty. She carried her head with a certain regal air, which enabled a stranger to distinguish the sovereign even when surrounded by the most beautiful women of the Court; that head which was destined to fall beneath the axe of the executioner, amid insult and despair. Her features were not perfectly regular, and her face was of the long narrow oval peculiar to the house of Austria; but the almost transparent brilliancy of her complexion, the serene light of her lovely eyes, compensated for every other defect and fairly entitled her to the epithet of beautiful.</p> 
               <p>The audience arose and greeted her with <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vivas,</foreign> which she received with the captivating grace which was her most distinguishing charm. When the royal pair were at length seated, the party which had accompanied them entered, and occupied the seats behind them.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph's breath came quick, and he passed his hand over his eyes to clear his vision, for it seemed to him that a phantom had been evoked before him in the person of one of the ladies in the Queen's suite. A woman scarcely less beautiful than Maria Antoinette, arrayed in a sumptuous toilette, sat in such a position as to be distinctly seen by him.</p> 
               <p>It was, it must be Alina; yet how came she there, and with such surroundings? Alina, calm, unruffled, and self-possessed, as if no wrong or evil had ever darkened her life, certainly was before him. Could another so marvellously resemble her, or was this indeed his false and perjured wife, who thus sat in the very blaze of royalty, the companion of the pure and lovely Queen.</p> 
               <p>It seemed impossible, and Rudolph fancied himself the victim of some fantastic deception. He closed his eyes, to open them again upon the smiling face which he, above all men, had cause to remember. When he had sufficiently recovered his self-possession, he touched the arm of Beaumarchais, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who is the fair woman in rose-colored satin and diamonds, who sits at the right hand of the Queen?"</p> 
               <p>"Ah! my young friend, you have an eye for beauty, it seems. That lady is, I believe, a countrywoman of your own; at least she is the widow of an American officer. She is the niece of the late Count Derval, and the heiress of his fortune. Her uncle was a courtier of long standing, and the Queen, in her goodness, has recently given her a place near her person."</p> 
               <p>"A countrywoman of mine? Can you tell me anything more of her?" evasively replied Rudolph.</p> 
               <p>"Only that she lives at Versailles in an exquisite bijou of a cottage, when she is not in attendance at the palace. She must be rich, for a handsome annuity is paid to her through our house from a wealthy English baronet, who is probably a relation. You seem greatly struck by the fair Comtesse, Monsieur.</p> 
               <p>"She is very like one I once knew," Rudolph steadily replied; "but the Comtesse Derval and myself have nothing in common with each other."</p> 
               <p>"Except your nativity; you both claim the same fatherland, and I fancy she would be happy to show some courtesy to her countryman. Suppose you accompany me to Versailles to-morrow, and call on her. I have a suspicion that you have served in the army of the Republic, and you may have chanced to know her husband."</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me; I have no wish to recall to Madame Derval the souvenirs of her early home. A woman who has the ambition to win, and the tact to fill, the high position she has gained, will not care to remember the land of simple and frugal habits in which she was reared."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps you are right; but it is a hard and cold heart<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6349-00000166"/> that does not warmly welcome a compatriot in a strange land. But the curtain is rising, and the play begins."</p> 
               <p>With his attention divided between the stage and what was passing in the royal box, Rudolph had no very distinct idea of the satirical piece that was enacting before him, although the most popular actress of the day, Madame Sainval, sustained the part of Countess Amabriva, and as Susannah, Mademoiselle Contat enchanted the public by her grace and voice.</p> 
               <p>The vociferous applause with which many of the hits were greeted, seemed to displease the king, for a deep gloom gradually settled over his features, and more than once the queen passed her hand over her face, to conceal the shade of painful emotion that swept over it. Rudolph kept his eyes fixed on Alina, who coquetted and flirted with the gentlemen in attendance, without apparently caring much for the performance. He was glad that he was sheltered from observation, as he had no wish to betray his presence in Paris to her, nor to disturb the belief she must cherish, that the bravos sent by her to assassinate him had not accomplished their purpose.</p> 
               <p>But it was soon whispered among the audience that Beaumarchais was in the house; the box occupied by him was pointed out, and at the close of the piece, the audience arose <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse,</foreign> and called for the author, while they threw bouquets against the lattice which concealed him from their sight.</p> 
               <p>At this demonstration, Beaumarchais arose, threw back the screen, and stood bowing and smiling before the enthusiastic crowd. Compliments and flowers were showered upon him, and the presence of royalty of birth seemed forgotten in the homage offered to the royalty of genius. But Beaumarchais was too old a courtier to forget the regal woman who sat before him, pale and astonished at this outburst burst. In spite of all opposition, Marie Antoinette persisted in coming hither, and at this moment it seemed to her as if the first open insult had been offered to the royal authority in the presence of the king himself. Beaumarchais made a low reverence toward the royal box, but it was scarcely noticed, and the queen arose to retire.</p> 
               <p>At that moment there was a commotion among her ladies; one of them suddenly dropped her opera glass, and fell back as if fainting.</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter with the Comtesse Derval?" asked the sweet, clear voice of Marie Antoinette.</p> 
               <p>"She is overcome by the heat and confusion. We must get her away as soon as possible," replied the court chamberlain. "The royal carriages are ready, your Majesty, and the cortge is formed."</p> 
               <p>The brilliant array passed out, and Alina, almost supported in the arms of her cavalier, was placed in a carriage with two other ladies, who overwhelmed her with inquiries as to the cause of her sudden illness. She said:</p> 
               <p>"The heat made me faint, and the vivas have given me a violent headache. Truly, it was an ovation to M. Beaumarchais."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my dear, I thought it was something you saw in his box that made you ill, for you were talking gaily enough to Count d'Ernonville when you lifted your glass and looked toward it. The next moment you looked as if you had seen a spectre, though I saw only M. Beaumarchais, with a very handsome young man by his side."</p> 
               <p>Madame L'Estrange was the speaker, and at that moment she had no idea that her protge had seen the husband she had been taught to believe in his grave on the other side of the Atlantic. Alina had endeavored carefully to conceal from her the true facts of her history, for Madame, although a very good friend of hers, she felt was not implicitly to be trusted. She peevishly said:</p> 
               <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6349-00000167"/> 
               <p>"I do not know what made me ill. Who can account for such sudden seizures? As to who was, or was not, in M. Beaumarchais' box, I am perfectly indifferent. The stranger you remarked is nothing to me."</p> 
               <p>"Yet he must have reminded you of something or some person it was painful to recall," said the persevering baroness; "for women do not grow faint at the sight of so good-looking a man as that, without a cause. Come, my dear-there is no one here but Madame de Lille, and she is as deaf as a post. You can enlighten me as to the cause of this scene, without making her the wiser."</p> 
               <p>"But, Madame, there is really nothing to tell. I became suddenly giddy-that is all."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Ta! ta!</emph> child. You're not one of the kind to grow ill from heat; but if you don't choose to confide in me, after all I have done for you, I have nothing more to say."</p> 
               <p>Thus pressed, Alina reluctantly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Then, if you insist on knowing the truth, the person I saw in Beaumarchais' box is an American, whom I have met in company with my husband. The sight of him brought back so many painful memories, that-that I lost my self-possession."</p> 
               <p>"No wonder," said Madame L'Estrange, drily. "Perhaps it was the good man himself."</p> 
               <p>"Madame, what can you mean?"</p> 
               <p>"What I said, my dear: that this handsome young stranger is Monsieur himself. A little bird whispered to me that my fair young friend made a misalliance; that she eloped from her husband with an English <emph>Milor,</emph> and a duel <foreign xml:lang="FRA"> l'outrance</foreign> ensued, in which the father of her child perished. Do not faint again, my dear, because I have nothing at hand to restore you. I only tell you this to prove to you that you had better have confided in me from the first."</p> 
               <p>"How have you learned this scandal?" asked Alina, angrily. "You must have tampered with my maid, who was pledged to keep my secret."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, my dear, that good Betty is no match for me. She is stupid as an ostrich, and I picked a few things out of her, almost without her knowledge. The valet and your good aunt furnished a few more hints, and my own cleverness pieced them all together. I think M. Mesmer would give me the credit of being a pretty good clairvoyant, eh?"</p> 
               <p>"And what use do you intend to make of the knowledge you have thus gained?" asked Alina, faintly.</p> 
               <p>"Do not alarm yourself, child, for I have no wish to injure you. On the contrary, on your prosperity my own fortune is to be based; you must marry a rich man, but to do this securely your husband must be got safely out of the way. Tell me the truth. <emph>Was</emph> that he?"</p> 
               <p>"It was," was the faint response.</p> 
               <p>"And he has followed you hither, probably to make another esclandre?"</p> 
               <p>"No, he has given me up forever. I am free from all fear of disturbance from him!"</p> 
               <p>"Then why did you betray so much emotion to-night?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I thought him dead, and his sudden apparition seemed as of one from the grave.'"</p> 
               <p>"So-o-then you have tried to put him there, and been foiled-eh? is it not so?"</p> 
               <p>"Madame, you infer very strange things-draw most unwarrantable conclusions. Besides, this conversation is dangerous. Madame De Lille may catch its drift in spite of her deafness."</p> 
               <p>"Never fear, for she can only comprehend when one screams at her; though, if you are innocent, you need not care if she does understand us."</p> 
               <p>This was a master stroke which Alina felt, and in a tone that was very humble for her, she asked:</p> 
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6349-00000168"/> 
               <p>"What has induced you to entertain such suspicions of me? I have done nothing to incur them, I am very sure."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my dear, we differ a little about that. A woman in your position does not causelessly have secret negotiations with a person in Paris whose reputation is more than questionable. One who, in fact, will undertake to use <foreign xml:lang="LAT">aqua tofana,</foreign> or the steel, for those who pay liberally for the service. Have you not done this?"</p> 
               <p>"Madame," said Alina, haughtily, "since you have entered my house to play the part of a spy upon me, I will no longer tolerate your presence. You can make your arrangemements to leave as soon as may be convenient to you."</p> 
               <p>"Softly-softly, Madame la Comtesse; do not lose your temper, and commit an imprudence which you can never repair. But for <emph>me</emph> you would never have gained the position you now fill; and a word from me can hurl you from it. I will not withhold that word unless you treat me with the consideration that is due to me. I have watched you for the purpose of gaining power over you, for I have plans that you can further if you choose to do so, and in serving me also essentially benefit yourself. Choose your course; for on yourself depends your future elevation or your ruin."</p> 
               <p>Alina felt that in craft and want of principle the speaker was quite a match for herself, and reluctant as she was to place herself under the guidance of another, she fully understood that no other resource now remained to her. Madame L'Estrange was evidently informed of her most secret affairs, and after a few moments of perturbed thought, she said:</p> 
               <p>"You have done much for me, Madame, and I recall my hasty words. I regard you as my best friend, and I trust that nothing will occur to produce further misunderstanding ing between us. We can be of mutual service to each other, and it would be silly to quarrel when we have so much at stake. Accept my apologies, and forget what I lately said."</p> 
               <p>"Now you speak like a sensible creature, as you are. We fully understand each other, and I will soon develop to you a scheme which will ensure you the most brilliant fortune, if you properly use the craft with which nature has endowed you. And now about this young man-what brings him to Paris, and how comes he to be in the company of Beaumarchais?"</p> 
               <p>"Beaumarchais is a banker; he has dealings with the Colonies, and business relations have probably grown up between the two, for after leaving the army the person of whom we speak dropped his last name and embarked in trade. He came to Havre, where he resided several months.</p> 
               <p>"And where you thought him safely buried?"</p> 
               <p>"I did; I have his pocket-book with his own writing within, which was sent me as an assurance that-that he no longer existed."</p> 
               <p>"Then your agent has played you false, and she must be made to understand that the service must yet be performed. This man is doubtless aware of the unsuccessful attempt made upon his life; he may be dangerous to you in the future, and should be properly dealt with. Self-preservation is our first instinct, and you must see that while he lives you are not safe."</p> 
               <p>"It was not <emph>fear</emph> of him that impelled me to the course I pursued," said Alina, defiantly, "for I do not feel it. He knows that I am his uncompromising enemy, for I have told him so, and he also knows that I have sufficient cause. <emph>His</emph> hand destroyed the life of my child's father, and is not that sufficient cause of deadly vengeance against him?"</p> 
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6349-00000169"/> 
               <p>"Perhaps it is-but the code of honor recognizes the right of the husband to kill him who destroys his domestic happiness. You are but a woman, and can visit retribution on him only through the agency of others; therefore I do not blame you for the course you have pursued. My only regret is that you have failed, for now you have the whole business to do over again."</p> 
               <p>"I will not be foiled this time," said Alina, sternly. "I will follow him up till I am <emph>sure</emph> that my vengeance is accomplished. No peace-no rest shall he have, till he finds it in the silence of his grave."</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Eh bien!</foreign> my dear; finish this act in the drama of your life, and the curtain rises on a new and more brilliant scene. I will soon develop my plans to you, but now I am sleepy, and this dear De Lille is actually snoring. It was very tiresome of the Queen to insist on returning to Versailles to-night, for I am really fatigued to the point of exhaustion."</p> 
               <p>She threw herself back, and in a few moments was slumbering as serenely as if the preceding conversation had been of the most innocent nature. Alina, excited and restless, could not sleep. She put aside the curtain near her, and looked out on the moonlit landscape, little dreaming of the wild turmoil that road was to present a few years later, when the first act of the fearful tragedy of the Revolution was enacted.</p> 
               <p>Alina had already imbibed the spirit of the class among whom she was thrown, and looked down with contempt upon the masses that were seething with the long repressed rage that was soon to break forth in a volcano of blood and retribution, which made the civilized world stand aghast.</p> 
               <p>She sat there revolving her own dark schemes, unconscious that partly through her agency one of the most deadly blows against the unhappy Queen was to be dealt. Madame L'Estrange was a subtle and daring intriguante, who hesitated at nothing which promised to better her fortunes; and unscrupulous as Alina was, the plan she developed to her on the following day, which was to be carefully and slowly followed out to its completion, filled her with fear. She would have recoiled, but her tempter had her grasp upon her fate, and nothing but submission or ruin remained to her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE LOST HEIR.</head> 
               <p>NEARLY four years have passed away since Sir Reginald De Vere led Helen to his home a fair and happy bride. The love that united them knew no shadow of change, for both were upright, noble and true, and never did domestic happiness wear a fairer or more serene aspect than in their household.</p> 
               <p>He steadily and honorably fulfilled his duties as an English gentleman of large estates and wide spread influence; and Helen, with her active temperament and benevolent instincts, was a fitting helpmate for such a man. As time rolled on, and their horizon was undarkened by a cloud, Helen laid aside her vague fears of her cousin, and blossomed in the sunshine of affection that surrounded her. The half-formed girl developed into a most attractive and elegant woman, who performed the honors of her home with graceful tact, and during the fashionable seasons in London, she shone as a "bright, particular star" among her compeers.</p> 
               <p>De Vere was proud of his wife, and he had but one<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6349-00000170"/> desire that fortune had not favored. He wished for an heir to his ancient name; a daughter had been born in the first year of their union, and although the little girl was loved and petted as few children are, still her father could have wished that Heaven had given him a son instead. This hope was at length realized, and when the little Ida was nearly three years old, a baby brother was given, at whose birth bonfires blazed, ale flowed like water, and every tenant on the estate had a present sent him in the name of the young heir.</p> 
               <p>Sir Reginald wished him to be named for his deceased brother, and with some reluctance, Helen consented. The fate of Sir Lionel was the only shadow on her bright path, and she could not recall it without a cold thrill of fear that on herself some retribution would yet fall for her indirect agency in bringing it about. She believed Alina impotent to work her any mischief; but if her wrong demanded reparation, she feared that a higher power would visit it upon her. If punishment came, she must recognize it as a Nemesis sent by fate itself, and not the work of any human hand, however ready that hand might be to strike her to the heart.</p> 
               <p>Her fears had long been laid to rest, but after the birth of this child, they arose again in spite of her better reason. She watched over him with the feeling that her treasure had only been lent to her for a season, and through him the first bitter trial to her maternal heart would be received. Yet the child was healthy and strong, and bade fair to live long to enjoy the honors to which he was born.</p> 
               <p>Preparations for a magnificent christening were made, and their friends bidden to the Castle to join in the festivities of the occasion. Helen would have preferred a more quiet offering of her child in baptism, but Sir Reginald was so proud of his heir, so anxious to exhibit him to his friends, that she could not oppose his wishes, and the castle, as soon as she was strong to bear the excitement, was filled with company. A priest of distinguished talents came down from London to officiate, and robes of regal elegance were provided for the new heir.</p> 
               <p>On the morning of the auspicious day, Sir Reginald came into his wife's room, and together they went into the nursery which opened from it, to look upon the slumbering child.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Helen," said the happy father, "this is the crowning blessing of my life. The boy is beautiful and strong; he will grow up to be my hope and pride. I love my little Ida most tenderly, but this boy is to maintain the honor of my house, to be its representative; and to train him for this sphere, shall be the pleasure and business of my life."</p> 
               <p>"And with such an example as his father, he must become a good man," said Helen, fondly clasping his hand.</p> 
               <p>"Heaven has been bounteous to us, my beloved; our sky has been so unclouded, that, at times, I almost fear some change must come."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, ungrateful Helen! after all our blessings, you cannot learn to trust in Providence. Never anticipate sorrow, my love, for has it not been said, 'sufficient to the day is the evil thereof?' If clouds arise upon our horizon, we must have faith to look steadily upon them, with the assurance that they will break away again, and the sun will once more shine upon us. In this hour, with my dearest hopes realized, I have no room in my heart for doubts or fears. God is above us all, and He knows that we have done nothing to merit severe chastisement."</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, Reginald. I will endeavor to cherish your confident faith. I am indeed ungrateful to doubt the goodness of God, when He has already so abundantly blessed us. But I cannot resist the feeling that this child, which is so precious to us, is rather lent than given."</p> 
               <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6349-00000171"/> 
               <p>De Vere grew pale, and he bent over the infant with an expression of solicitude. He presently said:</p> 
               <p>"Helen, this is fantasy; I never saw a stronger, healthier child of his age. He bids fair to live to become a patriarch: he will yet lay your head and mine in the grave, and reign as Sir Lionel De Vere in the home of his fathers. Put away this cloud, my sweet wife, and prepare to look your loveliest this evening. The mother of such a boy as this should show how proud she is to present her young immortal at the sacred font."</p> 
               <p>Helen smiled, kissed the child tenderly, and returned to her own room. The day passed away in the usual pursuits within doors, but the servants observed a strange woman loitering about the grounds, apparently watching an opportunity to enter the house. She was warned away, and concealed herself in the shubbery, still intent upon the purpose that had brought her there; though her conduct in the seclusion she sought was very singular.</p> 
               <p>She knelt upon the ground with a rosary in her hand, rapidly repeating prayers, which were occasionally interrupted by broken exclamations:</p> 
               <p>"I have absolution for the deed-I took care to secure that beforehand: but the father would have refused it if he had suspected that a little babe must be--Oh, Lord! a poor, sinless little lamb! receive him into your paradise, and pardon the hand that sends him there!"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>My</emph> darling must have his own, and this one comes to take it from him. These proud people have trampled on my lady, and now their own turn is come. Oh, Heaven pardon me, and grant me absolution for this sin!"</p> 
               <p>Thus muttered Betty, in a paroxysm of fear and doubt as to the perpetration of the crime she had been sent there to commit. Alina had an agent in her pay in the vicinity of the castle, who transmitted to her an account of all that happened there, and the birth of the heir was duly announced. Then she brought all her evil powers of persuasion to bear against this woman, whose fanatical idolatry of her nursling had become the passion of her life. Betty adored the boy, and after much persuasion she was induced to believe that it was her duty to remove his rival from his path. She was extremely dull, naturally submissive, and was easily wrought on by one she respected, to commit any act sanctioned by a better judgment than her own. Alina had treated her with uniform kindness; she had even forborne toward her when she learned that Betty had betrayed portions of her history to Madame L'Estrange, and she had thus won a lasting influence over her. To serve her mistress, and establish the imaginary rights of her son, the woman was ready to risk even her soul's salvation. In their parting interview, her employer had said:</p> 
               <p>"The girl is of no consequence; she may live to become the future wife of my son, and thus ensure his succession to his father's estate; but the boy must be so stealthily made way with, that no trace by which his fate is accomplished shall be detected. You must gain admittance into Vere Castle, smother the child, and escape as silently as you entered. If you accomplish this, Betty, without permitting a suspicion to fall on me, my son shall grow up to believe you the best friend he ever had."</p> 
               <p>"And it's true that I am that, ma'am. I am going to prove it by my acts."</p> 
               <p>Thus with her one idea of loyalty to the child she loved so fondly, Betty crossed over to England, came to the vicinity of the castle, and lay in wait to accomplish her dire purpose. She heard in the village of the grand christening about to be celebrated, and doubted not that in the confusion of the night, she could make her way into the nursery, where she would conceal herself till sleep fell upon the<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6349-00000172"/> household, then accomplish her nefarious task, and escape before her presence had been detected.</p> 
               <p>The chapel attached to the Castle was brilliantly illuminated, and the whole household, servants included, crowded to see the ceremony performed. The infant opened his large eyes and looked on the lights and the fair forms that clustered around him without crying, and the ladies pronounced him a perfect love. His proud father held him in his arms, while the priest pronounced the blessing of the church upon him, and then the whole party returned to the house.</p> 
               <p>A band played the fashionable music of the day, and the younger portion of the company soon formed quadrilles, and continued to dance till a late hour of the night. The infant was taken to the nursery in a sound sleep; the nurse entrusted with the charge hurriedly disrobed him and placed him in his cradle. The two servants whose duty it was to attend to him had strict orders to watch in turn beside him; but, apprehensive of no danger, they both went to the gallery that looked down upon the large hall in which the dancers were assembled.</p> 
               <p>A chamber light was left in the nursery, which was a large old-fashioned room, with deep recesses in front of the windows, shaded by heavy curtains. Screened from observation by one of these, was the agent of Fate, sent to work such woe to that happy family. She was pale and tremulous, and at moments an expression of indecision swept over her face. She listened to the sounds of mirth that filled the air, and muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Ye dance now, and make merry, but the cries of woe and wailing will soon fill these chambers. Oh, Lord, forgive me, for I fear-I fear, that I am sinning unpardonably in thy sight."</p> 
               <p>With light steps, Betty drew near the cradle, lifted the cloud of lace that fell around it, and looked down upon the child. A ray of light fell upon his fair features, which, at that moment, were smiling; a superstitious dread came over her, and she muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Holy Mary! he is the image of the Christ-child in that beautiful picture at Versailles, that I can never pass without stopping to look at. Oh, Lord! must I-can I stifle his sweet breath? His face will haunt me to my dying hour, looking so calm and heavenly. It is soon done, but oh! my hand trembles; and my heart seems as if it will burst from my bosom. Hark! there is a step! If I am found here, I am lost."</p> 
               <p>She hurriedly dropped the curtains, and shrouded herself in the recess of the window just in time to avoid detection. The nursery maid came flying in nearly breathless, and the cause of her haste was immediately apparent, for Lady De Vere came in from her own apartment to see if her children were quietly sleeping. She bent over the bed of the little girl, kissed her brow, and asked of the girl:</p> 
               <p>"Has the baby continued to sleep calmly, Jane? I was afraid such unusual excitement would make him restless."</p> 
               <p>"Oh! he's slept like an angel, as he is, my lady. You needn't feel uneasy about him. Winny and me will take good care of him, be sure of that."</p> 
               <p>Helen examined him herself, and saw that he was in a sweet slumber; then giving the girl strict injunctions to remain beside him till Winny came to take her place, she departed to her guests, satisfied that her treasures were safe.</p> 
               <p>The echo of her steps had scarcely died away, when Jane arose, looked around the room, and muttered:</p> 
               <p>"I've given the baby a sleeping potion, and it's no use staying here till Winny comes. I'll keep an eye on my lady, and if I see her coming up the staircase, I can get here in time, as I did just now. So, I'll go at once."</p> 
               <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6349-00000173"/> 
               <p>She left the room, and after a few moments Betty again came from her place of concealment; but she seemed more nervous and tremulous than before. The sight of the mother's solicitude had touched a cord in her heart, for, as we before said, the strongest instinct of her nature was a passionate love for children, and the fondness of this fair and gentle woman for her helpless little ones, placed before Betty all the anguish she was about to inflict on one who had never injured her. With faltering steps she again drew near the cradle, and looked upon its helpless occupant. His strong resemblance to Alina's son at that moment struck her, and she wildly muttered:</p> 
               <p>"I can never do it-never! It would be like killing my own Lionel-my precious darling. Yet how can I go back without doing my errand? My lady will never forgive me; she will cast me off, and I shall see my darling no more."</p> 
               <p>In a paroxysm of desperation, she lifted a pillow from the little girl's bed, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"It is but five minutes work-in that time he will cease to breathe forever, and no trace will be left to tell how he passed away. Oh yes-yes-in my heart-in my brain, the memory will be forever goading me on to madness. I cannot-no-no I dare not; yet I must do <emph>something</emph>-I dare not go back and tell <emph>her</emph> the boy is yet with his parents."</p> 
               <p>After a few moments of fearful indecision, she collected together the clothing which had been taken off the two children, rolled it in a bundle, and lifting the infant, she carefully wrapped him in the dark shawl she had worn around her own shoulders. Then placing the rude substitute in the place the boy had lately occupied, Betty stealthily made her way down the private stair-case through which she had gained access to the apartment, and fled swiftly through the shrubbery, scarcely knowing what step she would next take to escape detection.</p> 
                
               <p>Betty was strong, and swift of foot; the light weight of the child was scarcely an incumbrance, and the kidnapper dashed through the woodland with the wild speed of a hunted tigress. She presently slackened her speed, and walked steadily onward for an hour. Then a cart going to market in a neighboring town overtook her, and the driver good-naturedly permitted her to take a seat in it till they entered the town.</p> 
               <p>A horn was blowing, and a stage coach stood at the door of the principal inn; this she ascertained was starting for London, and, after getting a cup of milk for the child, who awoke and cried for nourishment, Betty took a vacant place in the coach, for she knew that in the vast metropolis she stood a better chance to conceal herself, and find some means of disposing of her charge in such a manner as to prevent him from being traced and recovered.</p> 
               <p>She had a sufficient supply of money, and on her arrival in the city her first care was to seek an obscure lodging; safely established in it, she destroyed the costly clothing the infant wore, and substituted for it such garments as were suitable to the child of a person in her own station. On the second evening after her arrival, placards were put up throughout London offering a large reward for the recovery of the boy, and Betty feared to take any step toward ridding herself of him in England.</p> 
               <p>No resource remained but to take him with her to France, and there find means to conceal his existence from her mistress; for, during the few days she had had charge of the helpless little creature, her distaste to the thought of destroying him had strengthened into a positive purpose to save him, if she found it possible to do so.</p> 
               <p>Betty had once lived in a small fishing village near Dover, and thither, after many difficulties, she made her way. She had not been there for eight years, and the story she<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6349-00000174"/> told of her recent widowhood, with this young infant to rear, was easily credited. She represented herself as having friends in France whom she was anxious to rejoin as soon as possible, and, in a few hours after her arrival, a lugger departed for the opposite coast, on which she was received as a passenger.</p> 
               <p>How she reached Paris, or what disposition she finally made of the stolen child, she refused to reveal. After three weeks absence, she appeared at La Rosire, looking worn and weary; and in reply to Alina's eager enquiries she only said:</p> 
               <p>"The lad will trouble you no more, Madame. His parents mourn for him as for one numbered with the dead."</p> 
               <p>"Betty," said her mistress sternly, "you seek to deceive me; for, in place of destroying the child as you pledged yourself to do, you have only removed him. What have you done with him? I demand an explicit reply, for Sir Reginald De Vere has written me a most insulting letter accusing me of some agency in this affair, and conjuring me to restore his son to him. Speak-what have you done with the infant?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ma'am, he's put out of your way. I tried to save him, for my heart failed me; but it came to that at last, and I'd better have done it at first, in place of raising all this uproar about a poor little manikin that hadn't life enough in him to bear the rough time he had after I took him away from the castle."</p> 
               <p>"And he is really and truly dead?"</p> 
               <p>"Havn't I already told you as much, ma'am? And now what'll ye do about Sir Reginald? I hope he won't come here to ask questions, because I'm not in a fit state to answer 'em."</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely think he will treat me with such indignity. I have written to him denying all knowledge of what has happened, and defying him to trace any complicity in the affair to me. If he should come here, I will send you into the country with Lionel, to save you from meeting him."</p> 
               <p>"Yes ma'am," replied the woman vaguely. "That will be best; if I saw him, all would come out, for I'm strangely shaken of late."</p> 
               <p>"My good Betty, don't give way to fancies. Keep my secret, and your own, and your reward shall be great. Besides, to you my son will owe his inheritance, and I shall not fail to impress on him the gratitude he owes you. Look at him now, how he holds out his arms to welcome you back."</p> 
               <p>Betty sprang toward the boy, who, just aroused from slumber, looked as charming as an infant love. He was now nearly four years old, and he prattled his glad welcome to his nurse with many caresses, which were passionately returned by her; and Alina looked on with the certainty that, through Betty's affection for her son, she could mould her to any purpose.</p> 
               <p>The uncertainty of the woman's answers induced Alina to believe that she was attempting to deceive her as to the fate of the child, and for many weeks she kept a strict surveillance over her; but Betty made no attempt to communicate with any one; all the interests and hopes of her life seemed centred in her home and her nursling, and gradually her mistress adopted the belief that she had spoken the truth with reference to the young heir.</p> 
               <p>While this dark deed was perpetrated, mirth and music reigned in Vere Castle. The dancing was kept up till near daylight, and the giddy nursery maid only looked in twice to see if the children were sleeping quietly. She did not approach the cradle near enough to perceive that an inanimate bundle of clothing represented the living form which had been so stealthily removed.</p> 
               <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6349-00000175"/> 
               <p>Lady De Vere, overcome with fatigue, retired at two o'clock, and Sir Reginald ordered the head nurse to take charge of the children and see that they did not disturb their mother, who greatly needed repose. The woman and girl, extremely tired themselves, merely ascertained that all was quiet within the nursery, and throwing themselves upon their own bed, were soon buried in sleep from which they were to be most startlingly aroused.</p> 
               <p>Soon after daylight Helen awoke from a terrific dream, in which she saw her son thrown from a lofty precipice, and hastily rising, she threw on a dressing robe and came into the nursery. Ida lay peacefully sleeping, with her shining curls scattered over her pillow; and, after one glance at her, the mother flitted to the side of the cradle, lifted the drapery, and uttered a piercing shriek.</p> 
               <p>"Oh! my child! my child! Wretches, what have you done with him! Where-where have you hidden him, and who has placed this semblance of him here?"</p> 
               <p>Winny sat up, rubbed her eyes, and gazed around her in bewildered surprise:</p> 
               <p>"What is it, my lady? The precious darling was sleeping sweetly when I came in last."</p> 
               <p>De Vere, aroused by his wife's cry, hurried on his clothes, and came in to find her fainting in the arms of the woman, while the girl was wildly seeking through the room for some trace of the missing infant.</p> 
               <p>He apprehensively asked:</p> 
               <p>"What has happened here?" and his cheek blanched as his eyes fell upon the bundle of clothes that occupied his son's place in the cradle.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Sir-I-I am not to blame," whimpered the nurse. "I left Jane to watch here, while I looked down at the fine company. Ask her what has become of the sweet baby."</p> 
                
               <p>"I don't know nothing about it," stammered Jane-"I-I thought the child was in his bed. I was tired, and slept so sound that somebody's been an' took him away when I didn't know nothing about it."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, God!" groaned the unhappy father. "What can this mean? Go through the house; raise the alarm that the child is missing, while I take your mistress to her room."</p> 
               <p>He lifted Helen, who seemed as if dead, and laid her on her bed-in a few moments the alarming news spread through the castle, and a group of pale faces gathered around its mistress. It was long before she was restored to consciousness, and her first words were:</p> 
               <p>"Where is he? where is my child?"</p> 
               <p>De Vere replied with assumed firmness:</p> 
               <p>"He shall soon be restored to you, my love. I have already taken measures to trace his abductor, and a dozen mounted men have gone in every direction to spread the news, and offer a large reward for my son's recovery."</p> 
               <p>"Then he is really gone-gone! Oh! my heart will break! Let me go after him; let me follow him through the world till I find him again," and she started up.</p> 
               <p>"Helen-darling wife, you must be calm. I will do all that man can do to recover our little one, but you must summon your fortitude to bear this blow. Our child will be restored us, I am sure that he will."</p> 
               <p>"Who can have dealt this stroke?" she passionately asked. "Yet why do I not at once recognize the only hand from which it could come? Send to Alina, and demand my child, for she alone has malice to accomplish such a deed."</p> 
               <p>"If I thought that," said De Vere, in a tone of concentrated feeling, "there is no punishment that I would not mete out to her. I will write to her at once."</p> 
               <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6349-00000176"/> 
               <p>The letter was written and despatched; days of darkness and despair passed over the bereaved parents; the woman who had stolen the young heir was traced to London, but there all clue to her was lost. Helen still persisted in the belief that her cousin had caused her this anguish; she recalled her threats, and dwelt upon them with such pertinacity that her husband and mother were half convinced that she was right.</p> 
               <p>A reply came from Alina, in which she indignantly and defiantly repelled the charge. She ended with these words:</p>

                           <p>"In other days I may have felt aggrieved that <emph>my</emph> child was not recognized as the lawful heir of his father; but now it is no longer so. I am on the eve of marriage with a Russian nobleman of such vast wealth as makes your petty income seem trifling in comparison. He has pledged himself to adopt my little Lionel, and provide for him as his own son. Why then should I have committed such a crime as this? at a time, too, when such an accusation must seriously compromise the brilliant future that is opening before me. I have powerful friends, and I would advise you, Sir Reginald De Vere, to make no move in this affair which can implicate me in the most remote manner.</p> 
                           <p>"Seek your child, and find him, if you can do so, but do not suppose that idle threats, uttered in a moment of passion, could have been carried into effect in such a manner as this. I pity Helen for thinking so meanly of her kinswoman; I forgive her for the injury she has done me, and I hope this is the last communication we shall have with each other.</p>

               <p>This letter did not entirely satisfy Sir Reginald, and he wrote to a friend in Paris to have a constant espionage kept over the acts of its writer-to use every effort to discover if his child was in her power, without permitting her to become aware that she was an object of suspicion.</p> 
               <p>This was accordingly done, but nothing was elicited; the strictest search also failed in every other quarter, and although a large reward was constantly offered for information concerning the lost heir, no clue was furnished.</p> 
               <p>Helen faded day by day, until she became the mere shadow of her former self, and De Vere was aroused from the indulgence of his own grief to the necessity of traveling with her, and diverting her mind from the bitter regrets that filled it. If the unhappy mother could have known that her child was in his grave, she might have reconciled herself to his loss, but the uncertainty of his fate filled her with ever renewed anguish.</p> 
               <p>The happy home was broken up; Mrs. Fitzhugh went to her friends in France, Sir Reginald and his wife, with their little girl, became wanderers on the face of the earth; always seeking that which was lost, ever failing in their quest. In process of time Helen regained her health, but her heart was ineffably sad, as days, months, years rolled away, and no clue to her lost child was found.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FATE WEAVING HER WEB.</head> 
               <p>THE beautiful Comtesse Derval sat in her saloon in full toilette, with lights blazing on the sumptuous scene it presented. The walls were nearly covered with mirrors, and the floor looked as if a parterre of rare flowers, the hues of which were magically blended, was spread upon its surface. Curtains, richly embroidered, fell in heavy folds from the<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6349-00000177"/> windows; the cut glass chandelier sparkled in the light of the wax candles and the bright fire that burned upon the hearth.</p> 
               <p>Objects of art were scattered over the inlaid tables, and cold as the weather was, exotics in full bloom stood on marble pedestals, placed on every available spot in the room. A soft, voluptuous perfume filled the atmosphere, and Alina, in a green velvet robe clasped with diamonds, her magnificent hair dressed without powder, sat in a luxurious chair, looking as fair and lovely as in the days of her first youth.</p> 
               <p>Time seemed to have no power to change her, for her complexion was like marble, her eyes as serenely beautiful as ever, and her smiling lips even more seductive than in days of yore, for they had learned the syren art of flattery in all its perfection.</p> 
               <p>A thundering rap announced the arrival of visitors, and as Madame L'Estrange entered through a side door, Alina arose, and moved forward to greet the guests her servant announced.</p> 
               <p>"The Comtesse La Motte, and his Eminence, the Cardinal de Rohan."</p> 
               <p>The lady was still youthful, full of sprightly grace, and had that air of fascination which is the birthright of many dangerous women. She was very fair, with hair of intense blackness, on which a slight sprinkling of powder appeared. Her graceful figure was clad in an exquisite toilette, and her voice rang out with a clear metallic vibration as she advanced, with both hands extended, toward her hostess, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Dear Comtesse, here we are at last; such a time have we had getting over the shocking road between this and Paris, that I almost despaired of arriving at all. But Monseigneur was kind enough to bear me company, and to keep my spirits up on the way."</p> 
                
               <p>"I think the last assurance will bear reversing, Comtesse," said Rohan, with a smile, after offering his courteous greeting to his hostess. "Without your bright wit, and never flagging energies, I do not know how we would have fared. Really, this weather is like Greenland; such a winter I have never seen."</p> 
               <p>"And but for the benevolence of your Eminence, many would never have lived to see it through," said the sweet voice of Madame Derval. "I have heard blessings showered upon you by many grateful hearts."</p> 
               <p>The cardinal almost blushed, and with a half smile said:</p> 
               <p>"The blessings were due to another person, Comtesse, for I have only acted as the almoner of a very powerful lady. Such was <emph>her</emph> wish, and like a loyal subject, I obeyed. Give me no credit, for I deserve none."</p> 
               <p>"Truly Monseigneur, you were highly honored by the queen," said Madame L'Estrange, looking fixedly at him. He flushed, turned hastily toward her, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I have not named so august a personage. Excuse me, Madame, but prudence is a necessary virtue in courts."</p> 
               <p>"But we are not at court now, Monseigneur: and surely among a few intimate friends, we can afford to speak with freedom. Fear nothing for our indiscretion; we shall not betray the gratuitous commission given you by her Majesty to assist the poor in her name, till she can liquidate the debt she thus incurs. In the meantime, her funds must accumulate to pay for the expensive bauble she has set her heart on having."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Madame La Motte, with sparkling eyes: "Boehmer is likely to sell his necklace at last. He pretends that it is bargained for by a sultana, but we, who are behind the scenes, know that she does not live in Turkey. Ha! ha!"</p> 
               <p>The meaning laugh was echoed by the whole party, and<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6349-00000178"/> they gathered around the blazing fire; its light fell upon the stately figure of the prelate, revealing a handsome man of fifty, well preserved for his age, though growing slightly corpulent with advancing years. He had the gallant bearing of a courtier, and his dress was sumptuous, yet in perfect taste.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Monseigneur, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Promenade de la rose</foreign> must be deserted during this terrible weather," said Madame Derval, with a sly smile, which again called a flush to the cheek of the cardinal, but he quickly answered:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Madame, the sacred flower from which it was named is enshrined in a golden casket from which none of its precious aroma can escape. I inhale it as the breath of Heaven, when I unclose it to look upon its faded leaves."</p> 
               <p>"It is a breath that will waft you to the highest niche of power, Monseigneur; be assured of that," said Madame L'Estrange, significantly. "The hand from which that flower fell, will be regal in its reward to him who has dedicated himself to <emph>her</emph> service, even in its caprices."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Madame," replied the cardinal, with assumed humility, "I only aspire to serve the most gracious liege lady that mortal man ever claimed. But where is our cabalistic friend-our soothsayer, for I expected to find him here before me?"</p> 
               <p>"The bad roads have probably delayed Count Cagliostro; but he will certainly be with us to-night," said Alina composedly. "I am expecting his arrival every moment."</p> 
               <p>In fact, at that instant the grating of carriage wheels was heard on the frozen ground of the court yard, and in a few moments the celebrated philosopher, physician, alchemist and consummate quack was announced.</p> 
               <p>The door opened, and the flood of light fell upon the form of a middle-aged man of commanding presence, whose eagle glance scanned the group that arose to greet his entrance trance. There was a certain power in the face of Cagliostro, though at the first view it was by no means attractive. His jaw was heavy; his nose slightly retrouss, and his mouth sensual; but upon his low, broad brow, in the expression of his face, was stamped the impress of indomitable will and shamelessness of purpose that would have betrayed to a physiognomist the nature that dwelt within that frame which he proclaimed to have been rejuvenated through countless ages of time.</p> 
               <p>Thus looked the charlatan who had the hardihood to have a medal struck with his likeness upon it, under which was written the following lines: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"The friend of humanity, look on his traits,</l> 
                        <l>All his days are marked by new benefits-</l> 
                        <l>He prolongs life-he helps indigence,</l> 
                        <l>The pleasure of being useful his sole recompense."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>Whether those who now arose to welcome him were impressed with a belief in the supernatural powers Cagliostro claimed, is uncertain, but they all treated him with the reverential respect due to a Grand Cophta, who had conferred upon each one present the mystic degrees of his Egyptian lodge, and through whose agency they hoped to gain future power and wealth.</p> 
               <p>The credulous cardinal believed this was to be done through the trasnsmutation of metals, or the cyrstalization of diamonds; and the other neophytes, through the unscrupulous use of the means he might place in their hands. The Cardinal de Rohan rich, powerful, and ambitious, little dreamed that he had been chosen as the victim of these subtle conspirators, who played into each other's hands with a skill that led him to the verge of ruin; which affixed to the name of a prince of the church the disgraceful charge of theft, that ended in a long imprisonment and shameful trial, from which he at last issued triumphantly, but with ruined fortune and tarnished honor.</p> 
               <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6349-00000179"/> 
               <p>Cagliostro bowed profoundly over the hands of the ladies, paying to each in succession a happily turned compliment; for he was a thorough man of the world, and knew how to play the part of the successful flatterer to the fairer part of creation.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, my dear count," said Madame Derval, with her most charming smile, "we were just speaking of you, and hoping that no accident had delayed your arrival. I am happy to see you safe among us."</p> 
               <p>"And I assure you, comtesse, that I am very glad to exchange the icy atmosphere without for this cheerful saloon, with lovely faces, and words of welcome, which are deliciously grateful to me. I do not think, fair lady, that you will ever need my magic elixir, for youth and grace seem to have marked you as their perennial possessor."</p> 
               <p>She laughed merrily.</p> 
               <p>"Yet I should wish to possess the power to evade old age and wrinkles. I think I must obtain some of that precious liquid, even if it is worth its weight in diamonds."</p> 
               <p>"Ah-h-we shall see-we shall see. You have some beautiful diamonds, Madame. Those upon your bosom are very like some of the stones in Boehmer's celebrated necklece. I am a judge of precious stones, and especially of diamonds, for I have had much to do with them."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Monsieur; if rumor speaks the truth, the Count Cagliostro can transmute common crystals into most radiant jewels. This <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parure</foreign> was a present from my betrothed. They are family jewels which have been reset for me, and should really not have been worn before our marriage; but I wished you to see them this evening, and I thought it would be a delicate compliment to the Baron to wear them on this occasion."</p> 
               <p>"Then Maretsky will be here this evening, Madame?"</p> 
               <p>"Assuredly-he spends every evening with me when I am at home. He dined with Madame L'Estrange and myself, and is now with my little boy. He is very fond of Lionel, as the child is also of him."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! that must be a great satisfaction to you. Then the little <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Colombe</foreign> is ready for our experiment?"</p> 
               <p>"As ready as perfect innocence, combined with precocious intelligence, can render him. He is wild to see the phantoms in the water which the Baron has promised him, and half the day has been spent in looking through a glass globe containing my gold fish, in the hope of seeing a picture arise in it."</p> 
               <p>"Then he will not be alarmed, Madame? You have judiciously prepared him for his wonderful task."</p> 
               <p>"The Baron was kind enough to undertake that. I will ring, and cause him to be informed of your arrival."</p> 
               <p>Alina touched the enamelled bell-handle, and made a sign to the servant that answered the summons. In a few seconds the doors, opening into an exquisitely furnished boudoir, were thrown back, revealing a retreat as luxurious as Calypso might have chosen. It was lighted by lamps covered with misty white shades, through which soft, moonlit rays alone penetrated. In the centre of the floor stood an oval table, the top of which was inlaid with precious stones in a mosaic pattern. It was a miracle of art, and was one of the numerous gifts of the wealthy Russian lover of the hostess.</p> 
               <p>Upon this table was placed a large, crystal bowl, without flaw or speck, filled to the brim with limpid water. Standing beside it was a tall, leonine-looking man, whose high cheek bones, pale, blue eyes, and long, light hair, proclaimed his northern origin. He was not without some pretensions to beauty, for his features were clearly, though heavily cut, with an expression of good humor, mingled with keenness, in the lines of his face.</p> 
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6349-00000180"/> 
               <p>Mounted on a chair by his side was a tiny form dressed in a white tunic, over which a pale blue scarf was bound across his breast, and a pair of artificial wings were fastened to his shoulders. His dark curls were held back from his broad clear brow by a wreath of immortelles, and his large dark eyes were bent earnestly upon the water, for he had been taught to believe that forms would arise in it which would be visible to him alone.</p> 
               <p>The party in the outer apartment gazed a moment on this tableau, and then entered the inner shrine, in which preparations had been made for the promised exhibition of the necromancer's power. The Baron bowed with smiling ease at their approach, and greeted the newly arrived guests.</p> 
               <p>Cagliostro spoke in a low tone to Madame Derval. "Ah Madame la Comtesse, your son is indeed a fitting representative of a cherub. A lovelier or more intelligent looking child I have never seen."</p> 
               <p>Alina regarded the boy with a triumphant smile; but there was little maternal tenderness in its expression. She replied in the same tone:</p> 
               <p>"He is docile, yet full of imagination. I think you will find him an impressionable subject, for the Baron has ascertained that he can be magnetically influenced."</p> 
               <p>"It is not through magnetism that I shall now seek to act on him," replied Cagliostro loftily. "Through the superior manifestations of the soul, unclouded by earthly influences, this pure spirit shall speak."</p> 
               <p>The listener bowed respectfully, though she was skeptical, and began dimly to comprehend the agency through which the charlatan produced the extraordinary results which were so widely spoken of in Paris. At that day magnetism was scarcely known; Mesmer had thrown some light upon its mysteries, and he was then in Paris performing cures, through its agency, which were declared to be miraculous. By a dabbler in occult science like Cagliostro, its salient features were at once seized on, and applied to his own purposes, without acknowledging the source from which he derived his power. Not to magnetism would he attribute any of the phenomena he produced, but to the direct agency of magic, which he claimed to be exercised by himself alone.</p> 
               <p>A circle of chairs was noislessly drawn around the table in which the expectant enquirers placed themselves; for each one on that evening had been promised a glimpse into the future, and they all awaited the revelations of the seer with impatience mingled with a slight feeling of awe, for Cagliostro possessed a strange power to influence those who were thrown within the circle of his spells.</p> 
               <p>At a sign from Cagliostro, the Baron placed himself between Alina and Madame L'Estrange, while Rohan separated his fair hostess on the other side from Madame La Motte. The bright, sparkling eyes of the latter were busily engaged in noting all she saw, drawing her own inferences, and maturing, in her busy and scheming brain, those plans which were leading her on to ruin and disgrace. She claimed descent from the house of Valois, and enjoyed a small pension from the King; but all her efforts had proved unavailing to gain her an introduction at court.</p> 
               <p>The Queen steadily refused to see her, although she led her willing dupe, the Cardinal de Rohan, to believe that she was in constant communication with her majesty, and was entrusted by her with communications for the prelate. The stupendous fraud of the diamond necklace was then progressing toward its completion, and every one in that room, save Rohan and the child, was fully cognizant of all that had been done, and what yet remained to do, to transfer it from the unhappy Cardinal to the harpies who were seeking to prey upon his life and fortune.</p> 
               <p>In disgrace at court for the last fifteen years, madly desirous<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6349-00000181"/> sirous of being reinstated in favor, he imagined that the everlasting gratitude of the Queen would be gained by the purchase of this unique necklace at the cost of a million and a half of livres. He insanely believed that it would be accepted, and the place of minister be given to him as an equivalent for its value.</p> 
               <p>The perfidious La Motte found a woman who bore a sufficient likeness to the Queen, to personate her at night in the park of Versailles, and in that nocturnal interview, the rose which Rohan had so jealously guarded, was thrown to him at the moment of parting. At his episcopal palace at Savergne, the deluded Cardinal named a retired avenue the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Promenade de la Rose,</foreign> and when there, spent many hours in dreaming on the future distinctions that awaited him.</p> 
               <p>On this evening, he hoped to gain such knowledge of the future as would enable him to see his course plainly before him, and he sat gravely and nervously awaiting the promised revelations.</p> 
               <p>In placing the party, Cagliostro had been careful that there should be some point of contact between them, and with the child between himself and Madame L'Estrange, a circle was formed sufficiently near to maintain the magnetic influence around the point of interest.</p> 
               <p>He then drew some cabalistic signs upon the surface of the table, uttered an incantation in an unintelligible language, and passed his hands above the head of the child, who had remained silent and impassive since they entered. A nervous shudder pervaded Lionel's frame, his features became fixed, and in a few moments his eyes half closed. The enchanter looked earnestly in his face, faintly smiled, and touching his eye-lids, spoke in French:</p> 
               <p>"Unclose your luminous orbs, child of innocence and truth, and interpret the visions which shall arise before you."</p> 
                
               <p>Obedient to his commands, the heavy eye-lids lifted, the boy's eyes were fixed in a strange stare upon the bowl of water, and Cagliostro grasped his hand in one of his own, while with the other he waved a small magnetic wand, which he drew from his bosom, over the fluid in the bowl. In a deep, imposing voice he then said:</p> 
               <p>"Prophet of Fate, what do you behold?"</p> 
               <p>The other actors in the scene saw that bubbles of air were beginning to rise rapidly toward the surface of the water, and in a strange mechanical tone the child began to speak in the language of a person far more mature than himself; thus proving the clairvoyant state into which he had been thrown by his skilful manipulator.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, the pictures have come at last! There they are, so beautiful-so enchanting."</p> 
               <p>"Tell us, then, what you see."</p> 
               <p>"There is a grand saloon, in which is a crowd of gay people. I see a noble looking man in the robes of a Cardinal, who bows before a stately looking woman, who wears upon her bosom the most beautiful rainbow; but it flashes brighter than the one in the sky, for it is made of priceless jewels. The lady gives the prelate her hand to kiss, and congratulates him on his appointment as Minister of State."</p> 
               <p>The child had uttered this slowly, and with some apparent effort; he now paused, seemed to regain his natural state, and looked around him with an expression of surprise.</p> 
               <p>"The oracle has spoken," said Cagliostro, with a triumphant glance at Rohan. "You have heard the decree of Fate from the lips of my Colombe, and I trust that you no longer doubt your future fortunes, Monseigneur?"</p> 
               <p>The face of the Cardinal had flushed, and then grown pale, while the child was speaking; but now they wore an expression of radiant happiness, and he fervently said:</p> 
               <pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6349-00000182"/> 
               <p>"Thanks!-thanks! I no longer hesitate. The jewels shall be sent to her majesty without further delay. I have feared that she would refuse to accept them, or they would have been offered before. If Madame La Motte will still continue to act as my ambassadress, to her care they shall be confided."</p> 
               <p>The piquant features of the lady referred to, wore their most enchanting smile as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"Command me, Monseigneur, and you shall find me now, as ever, your most faithful servant and friend, if I may presume to claim that title toward him who is about to soar to the pinnacle of power."</p> 
               <p>The prelate gallantly lifted her jewelled hand to his lips, and said:</p> 
               <p>"As my truest and best friend, I am proud to claim you, Madame; and, when the power is mine, I will prove to you, that a Rohan knows how to be grateful."</p> 
               <p>A glance of intelligence passed between the other actors in this scene, and, after caressing her son, Alina said:</p> 
               <p>"Since the fortune of his Eminence is assured, let the enchanter wield his magic wand, and show my friend the Baron what his future is to be."</p> 
               <p>Cagliostro smiled affably.</p> 
               <p>"When a man is about to grasp the rose of happiness, Madame, it seems superfluous to ask anything of Fate: but, since you desire it, the future shall be unrolled before your friend."</p> 
               <p>"Such is his wish, and it is also mine."</p> 
               <p>Lionel had been receiving the caresses of Madame La Motte, who declared him a divine love; but, at the summons of the wizard, he turned at once to him, and, with the same serious gravity as before, submitted to the manipulations which were to endue him with the magic power of prevision.</p> 
                
               <p>Again he stood before them with his features colorless and rigid, his large black eyes looking fixedly in the water, while his hands were clasped upon his breast, which heaved convulsively as if a heavy weight was pressing upon it. Again the cabalistic wand waved above the bowl, and the same phenomena as before were visible. He suddenly burst into a joyful shout-</p> 
               <p>"I see them! I see them! Oh, the beautiful horses! how they prance and shake their long <emph>manes!</emph> Ah! there is one grander than all the others; he is black as night itself, his eyes flash with fire, and he paws the earth in his pride. His bridle is inlaid with gold and glitters with precious stones. A man in livery holds him-ha! ha! it is the same worn by the servants of our dear Baron. Ah! here he comes himself, to mount, followed by a score of gentlemen. They are preparing for the hunt; yes-to hunt the wolves that infest the steppes, for it is a Russian scene that I describe."</p> 
               <p>There was a pause, and the boy resumed:</p> 
               <p>"Now the court-yard widens; the walls of a great castle become visible, and in the grand entrance hall I see the Baron in splendid robes, receiving messengers from the Empress, who bring him his commission as governor of the province in which his hereditary estates are situated. The great Catherine also sends him the order of the Black Eagle as the reward of important services rendered to her. Ah, the Baron will be a powerful and successful man; he will rise high-higher, till he gains the culminating point of his career. His life will also be blessed in the love of a fair woman, who will sympathize with his ambition and aid him to gain the prizes of life."</p> 
               <p>"It is wonderful!" said Maretsky. "Lionel has described my Arab courser, Abdallah, that I left behind me with so much regret. He has also foretold the fulfilment<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6349-00000183"/> of the most secret aspirations of my heart. Verily a miracle has been performed before our eyes."</p> 
               <p>Alina cast a bewitching glance upon him, and he stealthily pressed her hand, as he whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Your cherub has shown you the future which I invite you to share with me. Does it satisfy your ambition? does it open a sphere worthy of your transcendent beauty and talents?"</p> 
               <p>"I am satisfied-I am happy, for I love you," she breathed into his ear, and a glance of deep meaning was exchanged between them.</p> 
               <p>While this by-play passed, Cagliostro removed the influence from the boy; he raised his head with some effort, and faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"Give me some water; I am sick."</p> 
               <p>A glass of water was hastily held to his lips, and, after drinking a small portion, he seemed to revive.</p> 
               <p>Madame La Motte said:</p> 
               <p>"And now my turn comes. Pray, M. le Compte, be as generous toward me as you have been to these two gentlemen. Though a woman, I am ambitious; I should like to mount to the empyrean on a <emph>golden</emph> cloud. Ah, if I only had money enough, I could manage all the rest."</p> 
               <p>"Doubtless, Madame; to one of your tact, nothing is impossible, when once the way is opened before you. But the child seems faint and exhausted; it will be better to defer your fortunes to another sitting."</p> 
               <p>An expression of such keen disappointment veiled her features, that Madame Derval hastened to say:</p> 
               <p>"Lionel seems quite restored; give him a little wine, and he will be able to oblige Madame La Motte without injury to himself."</p> 
               <p>"No, Madame," said Cagliostro. "So mundane a thing as wine must not touch his lips in an experiment like this. Since you are willing to try him further, I will give him just four drops of my Life-Elixir, one for each year he has lived, and that will renew his strength."</p> 
               <p>"Do so, if it will benefit him," said his mother, calmly.</p> 
               <p>Cagliostro took from his pocket a small crystal vial, with a gold casing over the stopper. From this he poured a minute quantity of the limpid liquid it contained into a Bohemian glass, and diluted it with water. The child demurred a little to swallowing it, but the will of the conjuror overpowered his feeble resistance in a few moments, and he drank the potion.</p> 
               <p>The light returned to his eyes, a bright rose bloomed upon his lately colorless cheeks, and he clapped his hands in childish glee. These manifestations were suddenly stopped by the waving of Cagliostro's hand, and again he assumed the rigid immobility which was necessary to the performance of the part assigned him. Madame La Motte clasped her hands, and with lips half apart, sat in an attitude of intense solicitude.</p> 
               <p>"Madame," said Cagliostro, abruptly, "the child has been long enough in this unnatural condition. Ask a single question, and I will get a reply for you; beyond that, I do not think it will be safe to go."</p> 
               <p>An expression of keen disappointment crossed her face, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"I hope to hear much more than that; but since it must be so, I will do as you bid me. Tell me if I shall succeed in my present enterprise, and meet with all the brilliant results I hope from it?"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Madame, you have already asked <emph>two</emph> questions; to the first, perhaps, I can get an answer; as to the last, I will see."</p> 
               <p>At the motion of the wand the bubbles began slowly to arise, and in a faint, far-off voice the child murmured:</p> 
               <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6349-00000184"/> 
               <p>"It is done-the glittering prize is won; but a tornado is rising-a sea of blood flows upward; ah! the water changes into blood!"</p> 
               <p>His tones suddenly arose almost to a shriek, his body violently convulsed, and in his agitation he grasped the wand of the magician, and struck it sharply against the edge of the bowl. It parted in two pieces, and sent the water flowing over the table.</p> 
               <p>There was a simultaneous rising and drawing back to escape the deluge, and while Cagliostro restored the boy to his natural state, Alina rang for her servants to repair the damage that had been done.</p> 
               <p>The party returned to the larger room, the doors were again closed, and a gay discussion held on the sitting which had just taken place. Lionel recovered his usual sprightliness, and after being caressed by those he had served, and having accepted the beautiful presents they had brought for him, he was sent away to his nurse before the exquisite supper was served, with its champagne and wines of cypress.</p> 
               <p>Till a late hour the revellers sat over the table, and all, except Madame La Motte, were in the highest spirits. She could not entirely comprehend the answer that had been given to her, and toward the close of the entertainment she sought an opportunity to speak with Cagliostro.</p> 
               <p>"I shall succeed, it seems, but what means the vision of blood? I hope it is not <emph>my</emph> blood that is to flow."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Yours,</emph> fair Comtesse? oh, no-'tis that of the million. A great revolution is about to dawn; I hear its mutterings, I see the red cloud of destiny looming before me; but you will be safe."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks for the assurance, for I began to tremble in anticipation of-I know not what."</p> 
               <p>"You can shelter yourself in your well-lined nest easily enough. A woman who, by her own wit, will secure what you have so adroitly gained, surely deserves to enjoy the fruits of her labor."</p> 
               <p>She raised her finger warningly, for the Cardinal was approaching them.</p> 
               <p>"If we intend to get back to Paris before day dawns, we had better take our leave at once," said Rohan. "We have had a charming evening, which we shall long remember."</p> 
               <p>"When you are Minister, I hope you <emph>will</emph> remember it," replied Cagl iostro, significantly, and the three hastened to bid adieu to Madame Derval and her companion. Baron Maretsky also took leave, whispering to Alina that in one more week he would set out with her for the magnificent castle her child had described. She pressed his hand, raised her expressive eyes to his face, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Yes-we shall be happy there."</p> 
               <p>When all were gone, and even Madame L'Estrange, too tired to talk, left her alone, Alina sank into the luxurious depths of a velvet-cushioned chair and reviewed her position, which it is necessary to state.</p> 
               <p>Through her own unscrupulous nature, and the intriguing spirit of her companion, she had become entangled in the fraud that was on the eve of consummation. But with all her want of principle, Alina could not think of participating in an absolute theft without a pang of pride at being so deeply lowered.</p> 
               <p>Madame La Motte could not gain admittance to the court, and it became necessary to communicate with the Queen through some one who could approach her. At the command of Madame L'Estrange, Alina became ostensibly that agent; though Marie Antoinette never saw the missives that were entrusted to her hands, or heard from her lips the sound of the Cardinal de Rohan's name. She was much too politic to hazard her own favor in such a manner.</p> 
               <pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6349-00000185"/> 
               <p>Messages pricked on paper with a pin were despatched to him in the Queen's name, which were manufactured by L'Estrange herself, to deceive the Countess La Motte, for in this nefarious transaction each party made a dupe of the other concerned.</p> 
               <p>A Russian Baron, a former friend of Madame L'Estrange, appeared on the scene. He professed a passionate desire to possess Boehmer's necklace, and he would have bargained for it at once, but alas! it was already promised to royalty itself, and no chance remained to gain it but by strategem.</p> 
               <p>He joined the plotters, promising to give them an equivalent for it, partly in money, partly in diamonds of smaller size, that could be more conveniently disposed of. His offer was eagerly accepted, and the husband of Madame La Motte was summoned from his regiment to Versailles. He was seen by Rohan in the livery of the Queen parting from his wife in the park which surrounds the royal domain; thus the Cardinal was prepared to recognise him as a servant of Marie Antoinette's and to deliver into his hands his casket with its precious contents. Of the booty, half a million was to be divided between Madame L'Estrange and her protge; twice that amount to fall into the hands of Cagliostro and Madame La Motte.</p> 
               <p>The Russian soon became passionately enamored of the fascinating Madame Derval, and fully impressed with a belief in his high position and great wealth, in spite of his complicity in the contemplated fraud, Alina accepted the offer of his hand.</p> 
               <p>They were to be married on the day the necklace was placed in his possession in exchange for the jewels and money he was to give, and in possession of his coveted prize, they were to set out for Russia.</p> 
               <p>Maretsky had taken such precautions, that even if the other actors in the drama were seized and tried, he would not be implicated; and the Baron assured Cagliostro and the Countess La Motte that if his name, or that of his future wife, was implicated, he would reveal the facts, return the necklace, and thus ensure their destruction. Their object was to swindle the Cardinal de Rohan of a large sum of money; that of Maretsky, as he set it forth, to gain possession of a jewel on which he had set his heart.</p> 
               <p>The Cardinal, with a facility that is almost incredible, permitted himself to be victimized; a few weeks after the meeting at Madame Derval's, M. La Motte appeared at his Hotel with a forged receipt from the Queen, the necklace was delivered to him, and from that hour could never be traced.</p> 
               <p>The actors dispersed to their several destinations; Cagliostro and Madame La Motte remained at Paris, while their agents went to England and Holland to dispose of the diamonds given them by Maretsky in lieu of those he received. The marriage of Maretsky and the Countess Derval was celebrated in private, and accompanied by her companion and her child, she was whirled away toward unknown regions, her heart filled with ambitious dreams of the future, while her new lord exulted in the possession of his beautiful bride and the coveted necklace, for the first of which a price of blood had been exacted.</p> 
               <p>Alina had pursued Rudolph with untiring hatred. He entered the French army, and soon distinguished himself by his gallantry and daring; but she kept a spy constantly upon his steps, and many times his life was attempted, but in every instance his unflinching courage baffled his assassins.</p> 
               <p>Despairing of success by her own unaided efforts to effect his destruction, she pledged her hand to her powerful lover if he would rid her of her enemy. The story she partially fabricated interested Maretsky; he believed she had been<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6349-00000186"/> sufficiently injured to demand this atonement, and he entered into her views without scruple. The pledge was given, and he fully believed it had been redeemed, for he took such measures as resulted in a certificate being sent to him from a town on the Rhine, where Rudolph was then stationed, in which it was stated that Sergeant Michel was killed in the tent of his commanding officer, on the eighth of March, by an unknown person, who fired on him as he was speaking to the captain of his troop; the ball entered his breast, and he fell dead.</p> 
               <p>Thus this hard and cruel woman went on her way, believing that she had forever rid herself of the man she had so deeply injured.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE ASSASSINATION.</head> 
               <p>BEFORE leaving Paris, Rudolph ascertained that a corps of partizans, whose service was of the most daring nature, was attached to the army of the Rhine. In this he volunteered, and assumed the uniform of a French hussar.</p> 
               <p>When he joined his new companions, a murmur of surprise greeted him, and one of them spoke aloud:</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Eh bien!</foreign> but the likeness is most wonderful; I could almost believe that you are the captain himself."</p> 
               <p>"Who, then, is this captain whom I so strongly resemble?" he asked, with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"Captain Ney, and a gallant officer, as you will soon find, for he is our commander."</p> 
               <p>The name struck on his ear, and caused him to start slightly, for it was the one borne by his mother before her marriage, and he eagerly asked:</p> 
                
               <p>"From what department does Captain Ney come?"</p> 
               <p>"From Sarre Louis, comrade; and his father is a good citizen of that place."</p> 
               <p>Rudolph turned away satisfied that there was good reason for the resemblance, for the officer under whom he was about to serve, was the son of his mother's only brother. Since the emigration of Mr. Rudolph, little intercourse had been kept up between the two families, and the new recruit felt perfectly secure in his incognito.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph first saw his new commander on parade, and he was startled by the perfect resemblance that existed between them. Had they been dressed alike, no eye could have distinguished between them, for no twin brothers were ever more perfect counterparts of each other.</p> 
               <p>The eye of the captain fell on the erect figure with its soldierly bearing, and he started as he recognized the soldier of whom he had already been told. He reined up his horse in front of him, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who are you? Whence do you come?"</p> 
               <p>"My name is Michel, and I am from the vicinity of Havre."</p> 
               <p>"Have you before served?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my captain. In the United States."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, ah! one of La Fayette's heroes. Well, my lad, you have fought the battle of freedom, now you will have different, but not less glorious work to do. Show what mettle you are made of, in our wild corps, and if I find you deserving, I will look after you myself."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my captain; I will endeavor to prove myself worthy of your kindness."</p> 
               <p>The captain galloped away, looking back, and marvelling at the singular resemblance to himself borne by this stranger. That evening he summoned Rudolph to his tent, and questioned him as to his former life; but he was<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6349-00000187"/> very careful to give no clue to the tie of blood that existed between them. His incognito he was determined to preserve, and the name under which he had entered the army, he trusted would secure him from further machinations on the part of Alina, but her spy had never lost sight of him from the night she recognized him at the theatre to the present moment.</p> 
               <p>Before he left Paris, Rudolph was attacked by three men in a retired street at a late hour of the night. He defended himself against such desperate odds, till a carriage accidentally approached, from which a cavalier sprang to the assistance of the single man he saw contending against so many assailants. The ruffians ran off, and after warmly thanking his preserver, who refused to give his name, Rudolph returned to his lodgings in safety, though every step he took was watched by one who was well paid to play the spy upon him.</p> 
               <p>Three days afterward, Rudolph left Paris for the frontier, and joined the corps to which he belonged. No bloodhound ever more faithfully tracked the steps of his victim, than did Jacques those of the man whose life he had pledged himself to take; and Alina joined in the ftes at court, or reposed in her luxurious home at La Rosire, with the certainty that this time the assassin would not fail to perform his errand.</p> 
               <p>Jacques became a follower of the camp, and matured his plans at his leisure; yet, by some fortuitous circumstance, they were always baffled. Providence seemed to watch over the life which had been destined to so noble a future in the grand panorama of events which was slowly unrolling itself.</p> 
               <p>In the four years that followed Rudolph's entrance into the army, his life had many times been attempted by the miscreant who had sworn to take it, but the bravery and reckless daring of the intended victim, saved him each time, and in the last encounter, the brigand was himself slain.</p> 
               <p>When this news reached Alina, she became desperate. She made her compact with Maretsky, and he pledged himself to have the obnoxious hussar removed without danger to himself or her.</p> 
               <p>Rudolph had been constantly in active service since he joined his regiment, and the great personal bravery he displayed, his perfect coolness in the hour of peril, combined with strict sobriety and excellent judgment, soon recommended him to the notice of his superior officers. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant, but he felt that his previous experience, and his habits as a commander, fitted him for a much higher position than he could hope to win in the French army as it was then organized; but he saw a brighter dawning; the people were about to assert their power, and in the new order of things, he might hope to rise to the position for which nature had designed him.</p> 
               <p>With these aspirations in his soul, he was one evening summoned to the captain's tent: this had become an event of frequent occurrence, for Ney found so much intelligence, such indomitable hardihood in his double, that he had conceived not only a great respect for his talents, but a strong attachment for him as a friend in whom he could trust, in spite of the difference in their rank.</p> 
               <p>A conversation of some length ensued, on the forays they had made, and those they contemplated making, and a daring plan of attack on the outposts of the enemy was concerted between them. They pledged each other to their success in wine, and as they stood opposite each other, a sudden whim seized Ney, and he said:</p> 
               <p>"I should like to see you in my uniform, Michel. Let us exchange coats, that I may see if I should know you from myself."</p> 
               <pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6349-00000188"/> 
               <p>"It is getting late," said Rudolph, laughing, "and in place of playing this wild prank, we had better separate in time to sleep a few hours before the reveille is beaten."</p> 
               <p>"No; I have long wished to see how perfect the resemblance between us is; besides, I wish to play a trick on some one."</p> 
               <p>"Not a serious one, I hope, captain?"</p> 
               <p>"No-no-a mere joke; your dignity shall not be compromised. Take off your coat-here is mine."</p> 
               <p>The young officer threw toward him the garment as he spoke, and having no resource but obedience, the sergeant gave his in exchange. In a few moments the transformation was complete, and Ney exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"I declare it is myself before me. Your voice is even like mine, and Navine will never know the difference. I shall surely win my wager."</p> 
               <p>What that wager was, or how to be won, was destined never to be known, for at that instant the sharp report of a pistol was heard, and the speaker fell pierced to the heart by a ball sped from a practised hand.</p> 
               <p>It was afterwards found that the assassin had made his way to the rear of the tent, pierced a hole in the canvas, and deliberately taken aim at the person he mistook for Rudolph.</p> 
               <p>There was a sudden rush of feet at the sound of the shot; many voices asked how this had occurred, and with his unfailing presence of mind, Rudolph answered clearly, and directed the search for the murderer. His discharged pistol was found on the ground near the spot from which it had been fired, and the hole in the canvas bore witness to the truth of Rudolph's statement: the encampment was soon in a state of great excitement, but the perpetrator of the deed was nowhere to be found.</p> 
               <p>During the whole of this time, the men addressed Rudolph as their captain, for they thought their comrade had perished. Suddenly the thought flashed upon him that now he had it in his power completely to evade his enemies, and at the same time secure such a position as would open to him a fair field for the talents he possessed. Ney was his cousin; he had won his own position; he owned neither family, nor fortune, then why hesitate to constitute himself his heir, since all he would gain thereby would be the military rank of which he could make such good use? Why should he not seize this opportunity which Fate itself seemed to have placed in his hands?</p> 
               <p>With that rapidity of action which ever characterized him, Rudolph decided at once, and as Captain Ney he returned to the tent, and issued his orders. The habits of life of the deceased were intimately known to him, and there was little difficulty in maintaining the character he had assumed. Indeed, in a few weeks he almost forgot that it was not his own, though his brother officers marvelled at the sudden display of abilities they had scarcely suspected Ney of possessing.</p> 
               <p>His corps consisted of five hundred partizans whose duty it was to reconnoitre the position of the enemy, and cut off their convoys; to this arduous and perilous service the new captain gave all the energies, both mental and physical, that he possessed. Daunted by no difficulties-deterred by no toils, deceived by no strategem, at the head of his gallant band of warriors, Ney, as we shall henceforth call our hero, acquired the title of the Indefatigable. His rise was rapid and certain; and his popularity among his men was unbounded.</p> 
               <p>Then commenced that series of brilliant exploits which caused Napoleon to say of him at St. Helena that he was the bravest man he ever saw. Those who beheld him in the hour of peril, with cannon crashing around him, sabres<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6349-00000189"/> flashing on every side, and death in its most fearful form, mowing down thousands before him, were struck with the iron calmness with which he issued his orders, always seeing the right point of attack, and seizing the moment in which it would be successful.</p> 
               <p>His indifference to life was marvellous to lookers on, for they could not see how deeply the iron had entered into his soul, nor comprehend that the soldier's death upon the battle-field was the fate that would have been most welcome to him. His tree of life has been struck at the root, its blossoms withered, and its fruits turned to ashes in his grasp, and now he only asked the warrior's fame, the warrior's grave. But a charmed life seemed to be his, for amid the storm of bullets, in the thickest of the fight, all passed him scathless by.</p> 
               <p>In his new career there was but one regret: he must relinquish the friends he valued, and be to them as one dead.</p> 
               <p>He had frequently visited the Chateau de St. Angeau since he first became acquainted with its inmates, and a strong attachment bound him to them. The little Agla had won for herself a warm place in his heart, and young as the child was, she seemed to adore her preserver.</p> 
               <p>Now they, like others, must believe that he had perished by the hand of the assassin, for it was imperatively necessary to maintain his secret, and the letter was dispatched which announced to M. St. Angeau that his friend Michel was no more.</p> 
               <p>Bitter was the grief it occasioned at the chateau, and Agla fell ill, and languished so long that her parents were compelled to leave their beloved retreat, and take her to the baths of Plombires. With great care she recovered her health, but the elasticity of childhood seemed gone forever. She would sit and dream for hours without speaking, and after her return home she was often found kneeling before the picture of her lost friend, praying for the repose of his soul.</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Maman,</foreign>" she one day said to her mother, "now Michel is gone from me, I never intend to marry any one; when I am a young lady, I will have no lovers."</p> 
               <p>"But, my darling, Michel was much older than you are, and if he had lived, you would probably have changed your mind when you grew up, and have selected some one nearer your own age."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no-I love only him; I would have married only him; and now he has gone to Heaven. I will try and make myself good enough to get there too."</p> 
               <p>The mother kissed her with a tearful smile, fully impressed with the belief that this fantasy of the little girl would pass away; but it did not. As years rolled on, and the sweet child bloomed into the lovely maiden, she kept her word, for no lover's vow was permitted to fall upon her ear, and her nightly orisons were performed before the portrait of him whose lineaments thus remained indelibly imprinted on her heart.</p> 
               <p>One other duty remained to Ney: he remembered the pledge he had given to Col. Calvert and his daughter, to send them some token of his prosperous fortunes. Recalling the flattering reception once given him at the Hall, he drew a picture of a laurel wreath through which a spear was passed, and writing beneath it, "All is well with me," took pains to ensure its safe transmission to the hands for which it was designed.</p> 
               <p>It reached Dora on a calm autumn evening, when she watched beside the couch of her dying father, for Col. Calvert's failing health had at last quite given way, and he calmly awaited the approach of the grim conqueror, his only care or regret in that hour being the lonely condition in which he must leave his daughter.</p> 
               <pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6349-00000190"/> 
               <p>The veteran was propped up in his bed, and the evening sunlight streamed through the open windows into the apartment, lighting up the wasted face and failing eyes of the departing man. Dora sat beside him, holding his chilling hands in both her own; he spoke with effort:</p> 
               <p>"The last hour approaches, and the one strong desire of my heart has not been gratified. I hoped before I died to hear from my young hero, for such a man as Rudolph will never suffer a faithless woman to destroy his career. He will win honor and fame-I know it, and should you ever have the opportunity, Dora, tell him that I said this with my dying breath."</p> 
               <p>"I will, dearest father; but do not speak of dying; I cannot bear it; I shall be alone in this wide world when you are gone."</p> 
               <p>"Poor child! It is a sad fate; but God is good: He has promised to care for the fatherless, and to Him I must commit you, my one ewe lamb. Has father Jerome come yet? My time is short, and I would receive the last sacraments of the church before I go hence."</p> 
               <p>"He has been summoned," sobbed Dora, "and he will soon be here."</p> 
               <p>As she spoke, a low tap upon the door announced the presence of the priest, and he entered with a letter in his hand. After greeting the father and daughter, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Here is a letter from abroad, which was sent to the Archbishop in Baltimore, and was forwarded thence to be delivered to you, sir."</p> 
               <p>"From abroad! Then it must be from Rudolph. He has found his true place, and he writes to tell me of his prosperity. Hurry, Dora, and read me its contents, while I have yet the power to comprehend them."</p> 
               <p>With trembling fingers Dora broke the seal, and an expression of blank disappointment appeared on her face as she gazed on the contents of the paper. She faintly said:</p> 
                
               <p>"It is not a letter, father: he has sent us only what he promised; a token that he has found a proper theatre of action, with a few words written beneath it."</p> 
               <p>"Show it to me; hold it near, that my failing eyes may see the lines traced by my dear boy's hand."</p> 
               <p>Dora placed the open page before him; he grasped it with his trembling fingers, and held it near his face. He breathed:</p> 
               <p>"Thank God, the noble lad is in his true element."</p> 
               <p>His eyes fell upon his daughter, and in heart-rending accents he exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, that it might have been! but Fate willed otherwise. Come, father, I must make ready for my departure; I only waited to receive this assurance of the well-being of one I love as a son."</p> 
               <p>The priest indeed saw that no time was to be lost, for the pallor of approaching death was stamped upon the features before him; and he hastened to administer the last rites of the church to the sinking man. His worldly arrangements were already made, and nothing now remained to do, but to make his final peace with heaven, and yield his brave soul to Him who gave it.</p> 
               <p>Dora's future was already marked out. She had decided to enter a convent for a season, and prepare herself for the duties of a sister of charity, as she wished to devote herself to the succor of the needy and helpless. A few thousand dollars, from the wreck of the estate, were secured to her, and in the life she intended to embrace they would suffice for all her wants.</p> 
               <p>Dora did not intend to take such vows as would cramp her freedom of action, or take from herself the control of her small fortune. She merely wished to enrol herself among those who devote themselves to good works, with the power to select her own field of action, and to move whither her own will or the current of events should lead her.</p> 
               <pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6349-00000191"/> 
               <p>This had been arranged for her by Father Jerome with the hope that she would eventually take the veil in the house into which she was to be received; but this was far from her intention. The one hope of her life was to look on Rudolph once more; to learn whither he had gone, and to keep herself informed of what might befall him. In his tumultuous career, he might need her services in time to come; she felt the assurance that he would do so, and as sister, friend, or nurse, she must be upon the spot to render such assistance as he would require at her hands.</p> 
               <p>That night Col. Calvert died, and was laid to rest in the vault of his forefathers. The old servants were provided for, and after parting from them, and from the home of her youth, with many tears, Dora accompanied Father Jerome to Baltimore, where she entered a religious establishment, presided over by a lady she had known from her childhood. Here her wounded heart found peace, but not content; as her grief subsided for the loss she had sustained, the yearning desire to fulfil her self-imposed misson gained strength with every passing day. She devoted every leisure hour to the acquisition of such a knowledge of the French language as would enable her to speak it perfectly. With the assistance of a nun from Paris, who was in the convent, she accomplished this, and then made her arrangements to leave her native land, probably forever.</p> 
               <p>War desolated Europe, and nurses must always be in demand. Dora sought and obtained the means of crossing the Atlantic with a party destined to such service, and few who looked upon the pale and placid face of sister Therse, could have recognized in her the impulsive Dora Calvert of other days.</p> 
               <p>Time and suffering had tamed the fire of her nature, and now a deep and yearning desire to do good for its own sake, was the governing spirit of her chastened soul. But beneath this lay the one fond wish which was truly the central hope of her being-to behold Rudolph once more, to learn whither Fate had borne him, and if it might be, to serve him in that crisis of his life which she felt assured would arise.</p> 
               <p>This presentiment took almost the form of faith, and this sustained her through years of wandering and hardship before a clue was gained to the whereabouts of him she so faithfully sought. Fortunately she did not hear the story of his supposed death, for that would have struck her hopes to the earth at once, and sent her to the last earthly refuge of the weary and broken-hearted-the convent's cell.</p> 
               <p>Before her departure from the hall, Dora sent a copy of Rudolph's token to his father, and that was the only news he ever received of the lost one. But he, and others who had known Michael Rudolph, watched the rise of Michael Ney in Europe, with the belief that he who had won fame in their own struggle for freedom, and this gallant young partisan, distinguished by the same traits, was one and the same person.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE REIGN OF TERROR.</head> 
               <p>THE reign of terror was desolating France. It had reached its culminating point in the destruction of the King, the Queen, and finally, in the fall of the Girondins. Robespierre, the incarnation of cruelty and sombre pride, reigned supreme over the bloody orgies of the Jacobins. Death, clothed in garments dripping with gore, stalked through the unhappy land, immolating all that brought<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6349-00000192"/> back a souvenir of the past; the ruler seeking to establish that chimera, the equality of men, through the only means left to him, the action of the guillotine. Death brings the monarch and the beggar to the same level; and by the inexorable decree of the million, the descendant of St. Louis shared the fate of his meanest subjects.</p> 
               <p>In Paris, in the second story of a house which overlooked an open square filled with trees, were three persons. A gentleman of thirty-five, of striking appearance and noble physiognomy, walked up and down the floor with quick, restless steps. He wore the plain garb of an English traveler, and an expression of wearing anxiety rested on his features. A lady in a gray robe sat near the window, looking pale and excited, and in the slender form, colorless face, and almost transparent hands, few persons would have recognized the gay and buoyant Helen Fitzhugh, who had stood at the altar with Sir Reginald De Vere but a few years since, in the pride of her youth and beauty.</p> 
               <p>Their daughter, a slender, delicate child, glanced from one parent to the other, with an air of timid questioning, and the expression of premature care on her fair features, proved that she too suffered from the cloud that ever hung as an incubus over the hearts of those she loved; and of late this cloud had deepened and darkened until it threatened to close as a pall around them.</p> 
               <p>De Vere and his wife had ventured into the lion's den, in the hope of rescuing Mrs. Fitzhugh from the remorseless guillotine. After a long absence from their home, they returned to the castle to meet upon its threshold the information that Mrs. Fitzhugh was in imminent danger of arrest; that her friends had concealed themselves; and she was in Paris, under such strict surveillance that she dare not attempt to escape.</p> 
               <p>To save one they both loved from the fate that menaced her, Sir Reginald and Helen were willing to risk their own safety. He wished to go to Paris alone, while Helen remained at the castle with their daughter, but she refused to be left behind. She would not permit him to go on so dangerous an errand unaccompanied by herself; if he perished, she would die with him.</p> 
               <p>Neither of the parents could bear to leave behind them the sole treasure of their hearts-the young Ida; she had never been separated from them a day in her life, and since the mysterious disappearance of their son, they feared to lose sight of her even for an hour. Where they could venture she must be taken, and accordingly Ida accompanied them to Paris.</p> 
               <p>With some difficulty they reached the city in safety, and obtained a retired lodging. De Vere was compelled to make his inquiries in the most cautious manner, to avoid being compromised by the human tigers in power. He believed that his nationality would prove a sufficient protection, but in the excited state of the popular mind this was a slender reed to rely on. Paris had so long been turned into human shambles, that the ferocious rabble looked with eagerness for the daily supply of victims, and grumbled at those in power if they were not forthcoming, caring little whence they came, or of what they had been guilty, provided they were immolated on the blood-stained shrine erected in the name of liberty and equality.</p> 
               <p>De Vere had now been six months in Paris without having gained a clue to the whereabouts of Mrs. Fitzhugh. He had been able only to ascertain that she had been imprisoned in La Force; but after a few days' detention there, was removed to some other prison-which one he found it impossible to learn. By using money freely, he obtained lists of those who had suffered the extreme penalty of decapitation within the last three months; her<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6349-00000193"/> name was not found among them, and this was the only ground of hope that Mrs. Fitzhugh had escaped thus far.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly there was a commotion in the streets beneath the windows, and the cry of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"> la lanterne!  la lanterne!</foreign> was heard, presently drowned by the muffled tramp of the gathering multitude, and the wild notes of the Marseillaise, in which is so strangely mingled the song of glory and the monotone of death. Few could hear it thus chanted, by an excited and maddened multitude, without shivering and growing pale. It seemed indeed "a hymn of patriotism, but also an imprecation of rage."</p> 
               <p>Helen precipitately arose, and said:</p> 
               <p>"It is too horrible! I can no longer bear this. They are dragging some poor wretch to his doom, and such incidents are of daily occurrence. Let us go, Reginald; I have given up all hope of learning the fate of my mother, and I believe I shall lose my reason if I remain much longer amid such sights and sounds of horror."</p> 
               <p>De Vere regarded her with tender compassion.</p> 
               <p>"Alas! Helen, I feared that your courage would give way; but it is no longer possible for us to escape from the city. Every barrier is guarded, and an attempt to leave, would bring suspicion upon us-perhaps arrest."</p> 
               <p>She became even paler than before, and clasping her thin hands, exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"And arrest is <emph>death!</emph> I am tortured every hour by the dreadful scenes enacting in this terrible Inferno, a city given over to the passions of the lowest and vilest of the mob. They destroy everything; they respect nothing. Oh, God! they have repudiated Thee, and with Thee all that is grand or noble in humanity."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said De Vere, gloomily, "the step from infidelity to license is very short, and these people have taken it at one bound. The man who does not recognize the divinity ity within himself, is not likely to respect that which God has given alike to all; in some, to be stifled and outraged forever; in others, looming up as a lambent flame to light the world upon its path. Of the last are the martyrs, and many have they been in this mad outburst of sedition and crime."</p> 
               <p>Helen did not reply, for she was occupied with her daughter, who had crept to her side and buried her head in her bosom to shut out the lugubrious sounds that penetrated into the room.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mamma," she whispered, "they are killing some poor man, and we cannot help him. Should not papa speak to them, and tell them how wicked it is to take the life that God has given?"</p> 
               <p>"It would do no good, my child. Your father would only expose himself to the danger of sharing the poor creature's fate."</p> 
               <p>The child shuddered, rushed to her father's side, and clasped her slender arms around him as if to shield him from the approach of danger. He tenderly caressed her, while he spoke to his wife in a low and guarded tone.</p> 
               <p>"In a few more days, I hope that a chance of escape will open to us. A reaction is taking place among the people; Robespierre, lately their idol, has been attacked in the Convention, and a powerful party is organized against him. The people of the better classes are weary of this mob rule, and they will rally against the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans culottes</foreign> of the sections when the time for action arrives. I have secured a friend, who warns me of the progress of events; and, when the tyrant falls, he will aid us to escape from this living pandemonium."</p> 
               <p>Helen listened with parted lips and dilating eyes. She faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"If the fall of the tyrant is our only chance to escape,<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6349-00000194"/> we may as well give up all hope at once, for he is too powerful to succumb. He will crush all opposition, and prove himself more sanguinary than ever."</p> 
               <p>"Hope for the best, my love, for hope alone can now sustain us. I must go forth on my daily quest, and make another effort to trace your mother. It would be cowardly to abandon the search, as long as a hope of success remains."</p> 
               <p>"I have lost all hope," was the despondent reply.</p> 
               <p>"Nay, never say that, Helen; for in the darkest hour, light oftens breaks."</p> 
               <p>At that moment, three knocks were heard below. Heavy steps slowly ascended the staircase, and the same summons was repeated on the door of the room. De Vere went calmly forward and opened it, though his heart beat painfully. A man in a blouse, with the cap of Liberty upon his head, brusquely said:</p> 
               <p>"Are you the citizen De Vere?"</p> 
               <p>Sir Reginald bowed affirmatively, and he offered him a soiled and crumpled letter as he said:</p> 
               <p>"This is for you; but good citizens do not retain the aristocratic <foreign xml:lang="FRA">De</foreign> before their names. I advise you to drop it, citizen."</p> 
               <p>"Your advice is good, my friend, and I accept it; but I am not accountable for the act of my correspondent. I am citizen Vere, nothing more."</p> 
               <p>"It is well-good day, citizen."</p> 
               <p>De Vere offered him a piece of money; but, with a gesture of contempt, the man refused it, and descended the stairs muttering something about the cursed aristocrat.</p> 
               <p>"What can it be?" asked Helen, in a flutter of excitement at this unusual occurrence. "Perhaps it is from my mother at last."</p> 
               <p>De Vere hurriedly broke the seal, and read a few lines traced in a cramped hand on a fragment of paper.</p> 
                
               <q>
                  <p>"The person you seek is in St. Lazare. She is under condemnation of death, but her name is last on the list, and three days must elapse before it can be called. Three days are enough for a man of energy and determination to save a helpless woman."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Helen eagerly read the lines while standing beside him, and she exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"At last we have a clue! Now what shall we do-what can we do, to rescue her?"</p> 
               <p>"I must consult with the friend of whom I spoke. He is a follower of Collot D'Herbois, and can materially serve me. My first effort must be to communicate with Mrs. Fitzhugh, and let her know that help is at hand."</p> 
               <p>"Poor mother, how wretched she must be! How much she must have suffered during this long imprisonment! If we can only rescue her, and take her back with us, it will seem almost like old times. Once more we will gather in our own home, and give up the search which has yielded us only disappointment. Our boy is lost to us; let us centre our affections in our daughter, and try and be happy."</p> 
               <p>De Vere kissed her brow tenderly, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Yes-it will be best so. We have done all that human effort can accomplish, without gaining any result. The child is removed forever from us-he is probably dead."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! if I only knew that he is in his quiet grave, I should be happy," said the pale mother, with a convulsive sigh. "It is the uncertainty about his fate that is slowly killing me. He may be starving, beaten, crushed by unkindness, and we, who pine so deeply for his presence, cannot succor him-cannot save him."</p> 
               <p>She wept bitterly, and De Vere lingered a few moments to strengthen and console her.</p> 
               <p>"After nearly seven years of unavailing search, Helen, it<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6349-00000195"/> is scarcely possible that our son yet lives. Let us cherish the belief that God has taken him to himself, or he would have caused him to be restored to us ere this time. I must leave you now, my love; compose yourself, and reassure this little trembler, who clings to your robe as if alarmed by every sound."</p> 
               <p>"Be careful, I conjure you, Reginald. Remember how helpless we are, and do not expose yourself to any danger that can be avoided."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I readily promise you that. I shall use every caution consistent with the success of my enterprise."</p> 
               <p>He bade them a tender adieu, and hurried to the Hotel De Ville, where he expected to find the friend of whom he had spoken.</p> 
               <p>A wild scene of tumult was passing in the Convention, which met at the Hotel de Ville. Tallien, Barrre and their friends were preparing for their final attack upon Robespierre, in which they charged him with the intention of making himself Dictator. De Vere mingled among the crowd that filled the ante-chamber, and after waiting a weary hour he saw the person for whose appearance he had bern watching come from the interior hall. He raised his hand to attract his attention, made a sign which was rapidly returned, and the two issued from the door at the same moment and moved toward a retired street without apparently having any interest in each other.</p> 
               <p>When they were free from observation, the Frenchman crossed to the side on which De Vere slowly sauntered, and asked in an indifferent tone:</p> 
               <p>"In what can I serve you, citizen?"</p> 
               <p>"Read this, and see."</p> 
               <p>He did not venture to give him the note he had received lest some one might be watching them. He dropped it on the pavement, and passed leisurely on. The man secured it, glanced rapidly over its contents, and quickly rejoined him.</p> 
               <p>"I was about to communicate this news to you myself, but some one has forestalled me. Citizeness Fitzhugh is in St. Lazare, and I have obtained a permit for you to visit her."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! how long have you known this?"</p> 
               <p>"Only three hours; but in that time I have earned the hundred pounds you promised me. I had some trouble to get the order from Collot, for he has much on his hands just now, but I succeeded at last."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my friend, and now let us use it as speedily as possible. Assist me to get safely away from this city with my family and this unhappy lady, and I will make the hundred pounds a thousand."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, citizen, I will use my best efforts to serve so liberal a person as you are. The executions still go on; innocent blood flows like water, but a better day is coming. If we can save citizeness Fitzhugh but forty-eight hours, a change will have taken place, and we shall be saved, or be crushed in one general ruin."</p> 
               <p>"Forty-eight hours? Will the crisis come so soon?"</p> 
               <p>"I have said it; the battle has already commenced: it rages now in words; to-morrow it must end in blood."</p> 
               <p>"And what will be the issue?"</p> 
               <p>"Who can tell? The leaders on either side battle for their heads, for to fail is death by the knife. We may lose all: if so, both you and I are lost, for suspicion has already been directed against you, and you have been denounced as a foreign spy."</p> 
               <p>De Vere paused a moment; his strong heart grew cold within him as he abruptly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Whence comes this accusation? You know it to be false."</p> 
               <pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6349-00000196"/> 
               <p>"Yes-and so does a greater than I, which is more to the purpose; but that will not avail you if Robespierre remains in power. Who made the denunciation I know not. I saw your name on the list of the suspected, and, citizen, to be suspected in this wretched country, is to die."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, you speak the truth; I must remove from my present lodgings and seek a better place of concealment,"</p> 
               <p>"It will be useless, for you are under strict surveillance and every movement you make is watched. Doubtless our steps are followed at this moment."</p> 
               <p>"Then how can you with safety give me the order you say you have in your possession?"</p> 
               <p>"I hold it in the hollow of my hand; when we part we will shake hands, and you can secure it. Call a fiacre at the first stand, and try to elude your pursuer."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, Morlaix; I will never forget your efforts to serve me."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, citizen, Madame Fitzhugh has been a good friend to me and mine in other days, and I do not forget such obligations. She has been guilty of no crime, although her name is on the condemned list. Adieu, sir, I must return to the Convention, for a terrible strife rages there, in which both your life and my own is bound up."</p> 
               <p>Morlaix offered his hand, and the transfer was dextrously made; he then hurried away, occasionally looking back to see if he was followed. He saw nothing suspicious, and passed out of the narrow street into a broader thoroughfare swarming with rough-looking men, mingled with soldiers armed to the teeth.</p> 
               <p>De Vere, watchful and cautious, slipped the paper he had received into his coat sleeve, and sauntered slowly forward as if he had no particular object in view, till he came to a carriage stand. Selecting one with a fresh-looking horse, he showed a piece of money to the driver, and said:</p> 
                
               <p>"Take me to St. Lazare as rapidly as possible, and I will pay you double fare."</p> 
               <p>The driver whipped up his horse and set off in a quick trot; they soon left the locality from which they had started far behind them, but he had not evaded the bloodhound, who had been set upon his track. The same man who had been the bearer of the note to De Vere, thrust his head from behind a pillar that sheltered him, and with a cruel laugh, said:</p> 
               <p>"Safely hooked! Now I'll see after the <emph>lady.</emph> Lady, forsooth! we exterminate such useless lumber here, and let only <emph>women</emph> live: women who can fight for freedom, and drink the blood of the aristocrats. Ha! I only wish they all had one throat, and I could thrust my knife in that."</p> 
               <p>With this ferocious thought he turned toward the lodgings of De Vere to carry to Helen the order for her arrest and separation from her child, for such was the infamy he was commissioned to perpetrate.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, De Vere was whirled away toward the prison into which he was so anxious to penetrate. The cab stopped beneath its gloomy walls; in front of the door stood the death-carts receiving their daily role of victims; among them were men, women, boys of tender years, and the anxious eyes of the visitor scanned each load with the fear that he might find among them the person he came to seek. He drew a deep breath as he became assured that Mrs. Fitzhugh was not in that fated crowd, and with a sickened and oppressed heart passed beneath the portals of the prison.</p> 
               <p>The keeper examined the order he presented, then gave the bearer a broad stare, and called an assistant, to whom he whispered a few words; he then said:</p> 
               <p>"Conduct the citizen to the cell of citizeness Fitzhugh. He has a permit to see her."</p> 
               <pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6349-00000197"/> 
               <p>The man signed to De Vere to follow him, and after leading him through several gloomy corridors, he opened the door of a small damp chamber furnished with a straw mattress and a deal table, on which was placed a pitcher of water and a plate containing some fragments of bread.</p> 
               <p>A gaunt and wasted form arose from the mattress as De Vere entered, and with a cry of surprise exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Reginald, I thought myself deserted by all; but you are here; you have come to save me."</p> 
               <p>"I trust so, dear madam. I have been long trying to discover your place of confinement; but until to-day I had little hope of succeeding."</p> 
               <p>"How long have you been in Paris?"</p> 
               <p>"Six weeks."</p> 
               <p>"And Helen?-Ida? Where have you left them?"</p> 
               <p>"They are with me."</p> 
               <p>"With you! Good Heavens! you surely have not ventured to bring them into this den of vampyres? I would sooner have perished alone than to have exposed those I love to such danger."</p> 
               <p>"Have good courage, madam, for I trust we shall all escape. I have friends, and times are changing in this miserable country. The reign of blood must soon end, and we shall be permitted to return to England in safety."</p> 
               <p>"And the boy? No news yet of him?"</p> 
               <p>A deep gloom overspread the face of De Vere, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"I have given him up, for I have sought everywhere without success. And now tell me how you came to linger in Paris till you were arrested. Why did you not fly to England at the first alarm?"</p> 
               <p>"I should have done so; but my cousin, to whom I was tenderly attached, was ill of an incurable disease. She required constant care, and the ruin of her family deprived her of the means to procure a nurse. I had shared her prosperity, and in adversity I could not desert her. I remained with her till her death; then it was too late to escape; for she lingered on through all the horrors of the times till the execution of her eldest son gave her her final death-blow. In a few hours after her decease the whole family was arrested: her youngest son and a daughter have already perished, and I know not why I did not share their fate."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh uttered these details with the air of a person who had suffered so much as to become stupefied, and De Vere gazed with the deepest compassion upon her whitened hair and pallid face. He made an effort to speak cheerfully:</p> 
               <p>"Have patience, dear madam, yet a little while, and I trust you will be free once more."</p> 
               <p>"But to-morrow the death-carts will demand their victims; my name may be called and then it will be too late," she replied, in a hollow tone.</p> 
               <p>"I have reason to believe that you will be passed over. Keep up your courage, for I trust that I can yet save you."</p> 
               <p>"You have risked so much to do so, that you deserve success," said Mrs. Fitzhugh with a melancholy smile.</p> 
               <p>"The poor remnant of my life is not worth much; but I shrink from the thought of dying by violence."</p> 
               <p>The next half hour was passed in giving personal details that were of interest to those who had been so long separated, and with some surprise De Vere heard the grating of the key in the lock. He looked at his watch and said:</p> 
               <p>"I was granted an hour, but they seem to have abridged the time. I had much to say-many arrangements to make; but now I can only assure you that everything that lies in my power shall be done to ensure your escape."</p> 
               <p>He arose, turned toward the door, which slowly opened and revealed a spectacle which seemed to turn him into<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6349-00000198"/> stone. Helen, insensible, with her long hair streaming over her person, was borne into the cell in the arms of a turnkey, who placed her upon the mattress before De Vere recovered voice enough to ask:</p> 
               <p>"What does this mean? and where is my daughter?"</p> 
               <p>"It means that you and this woman are on your way to Paradise by the road paved with saw-dust," brutally replied the same man who had delivered the note to him a few hours before. "As to the little one, she is but a baby, and she was spared."</p> 
               <p>"But what have you done with her? Bring my child hither, that she, at least, may receive our last blessings, if, as you assert, we have been ensnared to our own destruction."</p> 
               <p>"Well, my Prince, have you any more orders to give?" asked the man mockingly, "for you speak as if the world belongs to you. Your little girl is in very good hands, and will be well taken care of; that is enough to tell you, so I will leave you to console madame. Citizeness Fitzhugh, here is an order for your release, and you will come with me."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Fitzhugh was bending over Helen trying to restore her to consciousness, and she scarcely heeded his words. When he repeated them in a peremptory tone, she hurriedly said:</p> 
               <p>"Let me stay here; I do not ask to go and leave those who have lost themselves to save me."</p> 
               <p>"But you have no choice; come at once, or it will be worse for you and those you leave behind you."</p> 
               <p>De Vere aroused himself from the paralysis that seemed to have fallen upon him, and taking her hand said:</p> 
               <p>"Go with him, dear madam. Find my daughter, and keep her with you till she can be restored to her native land. If we perish, on you must devolve the task of protecting Ida."</p> 
                
               <p>"And leave my poor Helen thus?"</p> 
               <p>"There is no alternative, madam. Heavy as this blow is, we must seek consolation where alone it may be found."</p> 
               <p>The man again warned her that it was time to leave, and kissing the cold cheeks and lips of Helen, she wrung the hand of De Vere and was hurried away.</p> 
               <p>Helen recovered from one nervous spasm only to fall into another, and the only words that escaped her lips were faint cries for her daughter. At twilight a man came in carrying a stone jug filled with water, from which he replenished the pitcher, and then placed a small loaf of bread upon the plate.</p> 
               <p>Again the harsh lock grated, and the unhappy prisoners were left alone; alone in their desolation and bereavement. De Vere endeavored to comprehend how he had fallen into this snare; but he found it impossible to understand why he should have been substituted for the person he had come to save.</p> 
               <p>There was now but one hope left him-that the government might fall in time to save himself and his wife from the fate that menaced them; but what in the meantime would become of their daughter? that timid and sensitive child, left in the midst of such terrors as would assail her in a strange place, separated from all she loved.</p> 
               <p>That terrible night was passed in darkness; he sat with the trembling form of his wife pressed to his breast, endeavoring to sustain her courage by whispering hopes he did not himself feel. At intervals he moistened her parched lips with water, but neither of them touched the bread. Food would have choked them in those hours of bitter anguish, and the sad wail of each heart was not for the death that hung suspended over them, but for the fate of that beloved and lost daughter whom they might never more behold.</p> 
               <pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6349-00000199"/> 
               <p>Confused murmurs from without reached their ears, and they knew that all Paris was astir on that night, on the events of which hung so many lives; the dull echo of thousands of trampling feet-the wild cries of horror, or of exultation, came faintly through their prison walls; but they could draw no augury from them of what was happening, nor console themselves with the hope of ultimate escape from the snare into which they had evidently fallen.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">ALINA'S REVENGEFUL PLANS RIPENING.</head> 
               <p>A CHATEAU a few leagues from Paris was occupied by a foreigner and his wife, who had some mysterious connection with those in power, for they passed to and from the city without question; a paper with a few lines upon it, traced by the hand of Robespierre himself, being their passport at the barriers, and Citizen Maretsky found no difficulty in entering or leaving Paris at all hours.</p> 
               <p>Alina, still beautiful, though an expression of chagrin and lassitude veiled her features, sat in a poorly furnished room awaiting the return of her husband. Her own toilette also betrayed the change in her circumstances which her surroundings indicated, for her dress was of cheap material and carelessly worn.</p> 
               <p>On her arrival in Russia, Alina's visions of a grand future had met with a signal downfall, and she found that she had been made the victim of a daring deception on the part of Maretsky. He was not the Baron, but the younger brother of that dignitary, and his anxiety to gain possession of the diamond necklace was partly to gratify a penchant of his eccentric brother for collecting the finest diamonds in the world; partly to gain the large sum which Alina secured by her complicity in that affair.</p> 
               <p>The money and jewels which had been given in exchange for his costly prize were advanced by the Baron, who had so great a desire to snatch these jewels from the Queen of France that he was willing to give even their full value to gain possession of them. As the reward of his brother's dexterity, he bestowed on him a valuable estate, at the same time expressing the hope that it would not be dissipated at the gaming table, as his other patrimony had been. The caution proved unavailing, for in five years from the consummation of the fraud, Maretsky was not only ruined himself, but he had mortgaged his wife's annuity and disposed of nearly all her available property.</p> 
               <p>The Baron refused him any further assistance, and he returned to France with Alina, in the hope that she could realize something from the fragment left from her uncle's estate. La Rosire had passed into other hands, and Maretsky hired the chateau in which they now lived. He became a violent Republican, and found employment under the government as a spy.</p> 
               <p>Madame L'Estrange, in deep disgust at the deception practised by the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">soi disant</foreign> Baron, secured her own portion of the spoil, and retired to Vienna, where she lived in such state as drew around her a circle of friends and admirers. To her care Alina committed her son, who was placed at college in the city, and the faithful Betty left the service of her mistress to be near the darling of her heart.</p> 
               <p>The bitter disappointment and resentment of Alina at the deception practised against her, no words may depict; but Maretsky soon made her feel that she was in his power, and he threatened her with the heaviest penalties if she attempted to repudiate her allegiance to him. He loved<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6349-00000200"/> her for her beauty and grace, and he valued the subtle tact of which she was mistress too much to be willing to give her up.</p> 
               <p>At times Alina bore the chain willingly, at others it goaded her almost to desperation; but this man had an iron hand, with which he did not hesitate to crush the first symptoms of rebellion, and in time she became his obedient slave.</p> 
               <p>Two days before the arrest of De Vere, she sat and watched impatiently for the return of Maretsky from Paris, for she was anxiously expecting news from her son, from whom she had not heard for many weeks. She at length heard the clatter of his horse's hoofs, and hastened to join him in the supper-room. Maretsky seemed elated, but he did not communicate his news till the repast was over and the servant had retired.</p> 
               <p>"There are no letters," said Alina, or you would have given them to me."</p> 
               <p>"No-but there is something better. Something that promises money-money, which we need above all things."</p> 
               <p>"What is it, then? for I am as much in need of money as you can be."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, well, I have a capital chance to make a good haul now."</p> 
               <p>"Explain, if you please; I do not understand enigmas." He abruptly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Do you know anything of your aunt, Mrs. Fitzhugh?"</p> 
               <p>Alina shrugged her shoulders indifferently:</p> 
               <p>"I neither know nor care. She was only my uncle's wife, and we have long ceased to have any intercourse with each other."</p> 
               <p>"You will not be shocked, then, when I tell you that she has been arrested; that she has been in prison for the last two months?"</p> 
                
               <p>"What can she have done? and why did she not leave France before this danger reached her?"</p> 
               <p>"She has done nothing herself, but she was involved in the ruin of a family that was implicated in the faction of Camille Desmoulins. They have all perished by the guillotine, but Mrs. Fitzhugh is still in prison, and there is really nothing against her, I believe."</p> 
               <p>"Then you may be able to save her, perhaps. But how are we to gain anything by that? <emph>She</emph> has very little with which to repay the service."</p> 
               <p>"That is true; but that rich Englishman, who married your cousin, has actually come to Paris to find and, if possible, to rescue her from the fate that threatens her."</p> 
               <p>"Sir Reginald De Vere in Paris! and where, then, is Helen?"</p> 
               <p>"With him, of course; as is also their child. I learned this to-day from a creature of my own, and now, if we play our cards well, we can make him pay roundly for his imprudence."</p> 
               <p>Alina's eyes sparkled, and a cruel smile gleamed on her red lips, revealing the points of her even and white teeth. She rapidly said:</p> 
               <p>"They have thrown themselves into the toils, and now let them escape if they can. This is, indeed, glorious news, for it shall give the De Vere estate to my son."</p> 
               <p>"How can that be managed, pray? I do not understand."</p> 
               <p>"Yet nothing is more simple. You have access to Robespierre; ask for the release of my aunt, and as its price promise to place at his mercy an Englishman and his wife who came hither as spies. Once in prison, and their doom is certain: the girl I will take charge of; she is the heiress: I will send her to Madame L'Estrange to be educated; she will have opportunities of seeing my son, and<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC6349-00000201"/> they shall learn to love each other. When they are old enough they shall be married, and thus the succession to his father's estate will be secured to Lionel."</p> 
               <p>She spoke rapidly and decisively, and Maretsky listened with admiration.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, you are a treasure, I declare-a perfect treasure. Yes-you have developed a masterly policy; I will adopt it; I will save the life of your aunt by the sacrifice of these people. But we must lose no time, for clouds are gathering about Robespierre; the people are becoming weary of his ideal republic, which, it seems, is to be cemented and sustained by blood alone."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, if he should fall, what are we to do?"</p> 
               <p>"Do? Why, in the first place we will wring a few thousand pounds out of this Englishman for keeping off his trial a few days. Then, when he is finally dealt with, you can go over to England, claim the guardianship of the daughter as nearest of kin, and have a snug home at De Vere Castle, with a handsome allowance for taking charge of the heiress. Madame L'Estrange and Lionel can join you there, and your plans be more securely carried out than in Vienna. To <emph>you,</emph> with your abilities, all this will be easy of accomplishment."</p> 
               <p>Alina smiled, and held out her hand:</p> 
               <p>"Agreed. Rid me of Sir Reginald and my detested cousin, and I see my way clear before me. <emph>We</emph> do not condemn them to death, but the country whose laws they have violated. I cannot see my aunt perish without making an effort to save her, and that cannot be done without the immolation of these victims. Denounce them, and obtain her release as your reward."</p> 
               <p>"It is my purpose to do so to-morrow. De Vere has a friend who is attached to Collot D'Herbois. This Morlaix was once a porter in the establishment of Mrs. Fitzhugh's relatives, and it is chiefly through his efforts that she has not before been tried and condemned. When she was removed from La Force, he lost sight of her, and he has been using every effort to discover which prison she was removed to, urged on by a large bribe offered him by De Vere in case of success."</p> 
               <p>"How have you learned all this?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I have my agents, as Robespierre has his. I am in the secrets of the police, for I hold a confidential position among the accredited spies of the government. I have gained much useful information for those in power from abroad, as well as in France, and my full value is appreciated."</p> 
               <p>Thus was this nefarious plan arranged. Maretsky and his astute companion spent the greater portion of the night in arranging all its details, and providing against every contingency. Ida was to be brought at once to the chateau, and detained there till a safe opportunity offered to send her to Vienna, or to cross over to England, as they might deem most prudent,</p> 
               <p>Maretsky really possessed the power of which he had boasted, for he succeeded in obtaining the order for the release of Mrs. Fitzhugh, and the arrest of De Vere and his wife. He obtained information of the order for Sir Reginald's admission to the prison of St. Lazare, and caused a private notice to be sent to the keeper, commanding him to retain the bearer of it as a prisoner.</p> 
               <p>Maretsky then went in person to superintend the proceedings at De Vere's lodgings. Helen, almost in a paroxysm of frenzy, was torn from her daughter, and borne away in a state of insensibility, while the child was placed in a close carriage, which set out at once for the chateau.</p> 
               <p>A note was left for Mrs. Fitzhugh, which simply apprised her that a friend had obtained her freedom, and warned her<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC6349-00000202"/> that she had best remain in strict retirement until an opportunity to escape from the country, which should be provided, offered itself. The writer assured her that he should keep himself informed of her whereabouts, and communicate with her at the proper time.</p> 
               <p>The agent of Maretsky conveyed Mrs. Fitzhugh to a lodging in an obscure street, and left her there, too bewildered and ill to take any measures to assist those who had taken her place in the cell at St. Lazare.</p> 
               <p>Ida's cries and supplications were disregarded. Maretsky tried entreaties, then threats to silence them after they set out on their journey; finding these unavailing, he had recourse to other means. He forced her to drink wine in which he had mixed a powerful narcotic, and this soon stupefied her to such a degree that she was taken from the carriage in a helpless condition, and on being removed to bed, she soon fell into a deep sleep, which lasted many hours.</p> 
               <p>The grounds around the chateau were very extensive, and near a gate which opened toward a small village in its vicinity, was a pavilion containing two rooms, which had once served as a gardener's house. This was occupied by a solitary woman, who had lived in it a year before the chateau was taken by Maretsky. The recluse always wore a black serge robe, and a large bonnet, which concealed her features. She communicated with no one, and was known only as the benefactress of the poor people around. It was believed that she was under a vow of silence, for she seldom spoke unless compelled to do so, and Sister Therse, as the country people called her, was supposed to be one of the nuns whom the events of the Revolution had deprived of an asylum.</p> 
               <p>On the second morning after Ida's abduction, she was sitting under the shadow of a tree reading, when she was surprised to hear voices speaking in English on the other side of a thick hedge, which concealed her from observation. A child was sobbing and entreating to be restored to her parents, to which her companion replied:</p> 
               <p>"Be good and obedient, Ida, and my husband will endeavor to rescue your father and mother. They have been imprudent, and are in prison, but they may soon be liberated, and then I will take you to them."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, let me go to them now. I can stay in prison too; I cannot-I cannot live away from them."</p> 
               <p>"But it is my will that you shall remain here. I am your cousin; the cousin of your mother, and it would be criminal in me to thrust you also into danger."</p> 
               <p>"Then they are in danger! oh, my heart will break."</p> 
               <p>The child wept violently, and the lady drew her away; the involuntary listener could hear no more, but her sympathies were deeply enlisted, and she resolved to find out the cause of the child's distress; to alleviate it as far as lay in her power, for she lived only to do good to others.</p> 
               <p>Late in the evening, the little girl, pallid and forlorn, wandered in the garden alone. She spoke French very imperfectly, and Alina had no suspicion that the sombre recluse of the pavilion had any knowledge of English. She was weary of the child's wretchedness, and glad to be released from her presence for a season; so she lay down to take her siesta, and Ida went out to indulge her grief alone.</p> 
               <p>As she threw herself upon the turf, wringing her hands and crying aloud in the impotence of her childish sorrow, a soft voice spoke to her in her own beloved tongue.</p> 
               <p>"What is it, my child? Sit up and tell me what has happened to distress you thus?"</p> 
               <p>The little girl looked up, reassured by the kind face that bent over her, and wiping away her tears, said:</p> 
               <p>"They have torn me from my parents, who are in prison<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC6349-00000203"/> -and-and I know, in spite of what cousin Alina says, that those cruel people will kill them."</p> 
               <p>
                  <emph>Alina!</emph> the name struck upon the heart of Sister Therse as a blow from a poniard, and she hurriedly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who, then, is your father?"</p> 
               <p>"Sir Reginald De Vere."</p> 
               <p>"And your mother? Was she Helen Fitzhugh?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, ma'am; for my grandma is named Fitzhugh?"</p> 
               <p>The questioner placed her hand upon her heart to still its tumultuous throbbing, for she held the clue to the wickedness that had been perpetrated. By dint of persevering inquiries, Dora Calvert had possessed herself of the history of Rudolph from the time of his disappearance from Baltimore, till he left Havre. The actual fate of Sir Lionel De Vere she could not learn, but she divined it; and she comprehended the nature of Alina well enough to know that in seeking to gain possession of this child, she had some ulterior purpose to serve. She had also traced Alina's career step by step till her departure for Russia, and she was aware that it was the most ardent desire of her heart to have her son succeed to the inheritance of his father. She rapidly ran over all this in her mind, and then asked:</p> 
               <p>"Have you any brothers or sisters, my child?"</p> 
               <p>"No, ma'am; my brother is gone. My parents have only me."</p> 
               <p>"And you are the heiress; I comprehend all now, and I will baffle this wickedness, or perish in the attempt. Listen to me, and follow my directions implicitly, and I promise to restore you to your parents, if it is possible to do so."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, madam, I will do anything-anything for that."</p> 
               <p>Dora reflected a moment.</p> 
               <p>"Let no one know that I have spoken with you. No one about here is aware that I speak English, and your cousin, above all, must not suspect it. Return to the chateau; seem a little reconciled to the separation from your parents, and to-morrow evening meet me here. I will bring you news of those you love."</p> 
               <p>"Dear lady, how shall I thank you?"</p> 
               <p>"By being prudent and watchful. In that lies your only chance of rescue. I am satisfied that your parents have fallen into a snare carefully prepared for them. In what prison is your father confined?"</p> 
               <p>"In St. Lazare."</p> 
               <p>"That is enough. I will seek the city and find him. To-day the tyrant falls, and blood will cease to flow. Wipe away your tears; be tranquil, for I shall return with good news, I feel assured. Trust to me, and I will find means to deliver you."</p> 
               <p>Ida eagerly thanked her, and promised all she required; but Dora abruptly left her, for she saw the flutter of a white robe in the distance, and she hastened to gain her retreat before she was discovered.</p>

               <head type="sub">A GAME FOR LIFE OR DEATH.</head> 
               <p>DORA had many friends among the proscribed clergy, and one of these she sought in the present emergency. The Abb Dumont lived in the neighboring village, stealthily performing the duties of his profession; and to him she confided the story she had just heard, together with her own conjectures as to the motives of Maretsky and his wife for what they had done.</p> 
               <pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6349-00000204"/> 
               <p>The Abb listened with deep interest, and readily promised such assistance as he could render. He was in the habit of entering Paris as a market man, there to gather the news of the day without suspicion. His housekeeper often accompanied him, and her place in the cart was readily surrendered to Sister Therse. By the first gleam of daylight they passed the barriers, and heard the rejoicings of the people, who sat around bonfires and sang the Marseillaise.</p> 
               <p>Robespierre, lately their idol, had fallen; on that very day he was to be tried and condemned, and they were rejoicing over his doom. A new era had dawned on France, and henceforth the guillotine was to cease its diabolical activity.</p> 
               <p>If De Vere had only escaped the proscription of the last forty-eight hours, all might be well. The abb left his vegetables in the care of his companion, and sought a friend from whom he hoped to be able to gain such information as would be useful to him. That friend, by a lucky chance, was Morlaix, and no sooner had he named Sir Reginald De Vere, then he said:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, I had hard work to save him till the tiger was dealt with; but he is safe. He and his wife are liberated from prison, but they are wild at the disappearance of their daughter. She has been spirited away, and they can find no trace of her."</p> 
               <p>"Where can I find Sir Reginald De Vere?"</p> 
               <p>"At his old lodgings-rue de --, number fifteen."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you; I will seek him, as I have some news for him that he will be glad to hear."</p> 
               <p>'What-about the child?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe so."</p> 
               <p>"Then go in Heaven's name, and console the heart of that distracted mother."</p> 
                
               <p>"I will do so, and you will do well to get passports from Collot D'Herbois for this gentleman, with his wife, child and servant. He will need them by to-morrow morning, and he will doubtless pay you a heavy sum for the service."</p> 
               <p>"You are a wise man, Father, and I always do what you bid me; but I must also include Madame Fitzhugh in the party, for she must return with them to England. I have discovered where she is hidden, and I am on my way to her now."</p> 
               <p>"As you please; only get the passports, and provide the means of reaching Calais without delay."</p> 
               <p>They separated to their different destinations. The abb readily found the lodgings of De Vere, and brought to the wretched parents the first news they had learned of their lost child. He faithfully related all Dora had told him, and informed De Vere that as the reward of the service she purposed to render him, she desired to be included in the party, as companion or maid, as she was anxious to escape from France. She pledged herself to return to Paris on the following morning, bringing the little girl with her.</p> 
               <p>Sir Reginald wished to return with him, but to this the abb would not consent, as their plans were already arranged, and his presence might cause them to miscarry. In a tumult of doubt and anxiety, he prepared to seek Morlaix, and make his preparations for immediate departure when once his daughter was restored to him. On this day passports were freely granted, for the Terror had ceased to reign, and men once more breathed freely.</p> 
               <p>Dora returned in safety to her pavilion; there seemed to be a commotion in the chateau which alarmed her, but on inquiring of a servant if anything had happened, she replied that Citizeness Maretsky was uneasy about her husband<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6349-00000205"/> band, as he had gone to Paris on the previous day, and had not yet returned. There had been an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">meute,</foreign> and she feared that some disaster had befallen him.</p> 
               <p>Dora watched anxiously for the appearance of Ida. Late in the evening the little girl came into the garden, approached the pavilion, and looked anxiously around. The new friend called to her, and she hastened toward her, and tremulously asked:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, madam, have you heard anything of my dear father and mother?"</p> 
               <p>"Your parents are safe, my child. They are released from prison, and I have promised to restore you to them."</p> 
               <p>Ida threw herself in her arms, unable to utter her grateful thanks. She at length said:</p> 
               <p>"When can I go to them? My cousin at last sleeps. She has been in a fearful state all day, and I thought I should never get away from her. But she will not sleep long, for she is too uneasy about her husband's strange absence. She is preparing to leave this place to-morrow morning, and to take me with her. She told me so today."</p> 
               <p>"Then we have no time to lose, and you must come with me now."</p> 
               <p>The child frankly placed her hand in that of her new friend:</p> 
               <p>"Take me to my parents. I have no fear of you, but I do fear the lady yonder, who says she is my cousin; but I never heard of her before."</p> 
               <p>Dora led Ida quickly toward the pavilion, and wrapped her in a black mantle, the hood of which served in place of a bonnet; then locking the door she opened a private gate, which unclosed on the open country, and they commenced their flight toward the village, in which the Abb Dumont lived.</p> 
                
               <p>The path led through a woodland, which they traversed in safety; but the way was long, and the child of late unused to walking. She soon breathed heavily, and complained of being fatigued. Her companion sustained her wavering steps, and assured her that in an hour they would be beneath the shelter of a friendly roof, where she could rest before setting out for Paris. The thought of soon seeing her parents infused new life into the weary little creature, and again she went on with swift steps.</p> 
               <p>Twilight had fallen, and the stars came out in the clear, blue sky. Suddenly the clatter of a horse's hoofs, coming from the direction of the chateau, was heard; and in alarm, Dora looked around for some place of concealment for her little companion. They were now in the open road, and no friendly thicket was near to shelter her from observation.</p> 
               <p>In the shadow of a high fence she discovered a cart, which had broken down and been thrust on one side, till the owner could return and remove it. Behind this she placed the slender form of Ida, and rapidly explained to her that she would walk slowly forward till the person who was approaching them had passed by; then she would return for her.</p> 
               <p>The trembling yet docile child comprehended that this was her only chance to escape observation, and she crouched down with her dark wrapping folded around her, in as small a space as possible.</p> 
               <p>Dora took out her rosary and moved leisurely down the road. The rider saw her dark form, recognized the benevolent recluse, for she was known to every one in the vicinity, and sharply pulled up his horse.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Citizeness Therse 'tis you. Have you, by chance, seen a little girl straggling beyond the garden of the chateau? Citizen Maretsky brought one there two days ago, and she has disappeared. I am sent to find some trace of her."</p> 
               <pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC6349-00000206"/> 
               <p>"I saw her in the garden just before I left," replied Dora. "If you have seen nothing of her on the road you have just traversed, she must have taken another direction; or perhaps she is still in the garden. It is large, and has many hiding-places in it."</p> 
               <p>"It has already been thoroughly searched. No-she has run off, and Citizeness Maretsky is in a frightful passion about it. Since you have seen nothing of her, she cannot be on this road, so I may as well take some other direction."</p> 
               <p>As he turned his horse's head, his eye fell upon the broken cart, and, to Dora's intense alarm, he rode toward it and made a brief pause; but the frightened child sat perfectly motionless behind the wheel that sheltered her, and, after a moment of breathless suspense, the man put spurs to his horse and galloped back the way he had come.</p> 
               <p>Dora waited till the last sound had died away, and then drew out the trembling fugitive, who was nearly insensible from fright.</p> 
               <p>"The danger is past, my love; we shall now be able to reach the village without further pursuit."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, I felt as if I must die if he dragged me out; but he is gone. Let us run, madam, for he may come back again."</p> 
               <p>"No-you would soon become exhausted; we will walk quietly forward, and keep our strength for an emergency, if one should arise."</p> 
               <p>No further alarm reached them, and, as the village clock was striking nine, they reached the humble cottage of the Abb Dumont, which stood in a vegetable garden which he cultivated himself. His market cart, already loaded, was in front of the door, and the stout mule that drew it was grazing in a small paddock at one end of the house. The priest, a slender, worn-looking man, received them with great kindness, and congratulated Dora on her successful evasion.</p> 
                
               <p>"The danger is not yet over," she replied, "for the alarm at the chateau will extend here. This child must rest before we can remove her; but where can we find a place of safety for her?"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, we are provided against surprises; I will put her where I have often been concealed myself from the myrmidons of the Terror.</p> 
               <p>Ida, overcome with fatigue, had placed her head upon the table, and was already asleep. The Abb approached the large fire place, touched a concealed spring, and the back opened, revealing a narrow recess in which a man might sit reclining against the wall. In reply to his summons, an old woman came in bringing in an armful of bedclothes, and in a few moments a pallet was spread within the cavity, and Ida was placed upon it. Dora aroused her, and explained that if she heard a noise in the room she must remain perfectly quiet, or she would not only compromise her own safety, but that of the friends who were aiding her to escape. With a sweet, sad smile, she replied:</p> 
               <p>"No one shall suffer through my cowardice. I will remember all you have said, and remain as still as if dead."</p> 
               <p>The housekeeper placed bread, and butter, and milk before them, and after partaking of this frugal fare Ida lay down upon her hard couch, and saw the panel close with some palpitation of the heart; but she had perfect trust in her new friends, and she soon slept peacefully. Dora went to the cottage of one of the neighbors who was ill, and remained with her several hours, ministering to her as she was in the habit of doing to the sick poor in the vicinity.</p> 
               <p>Just as she had laid aside her fears, and was preparing to return to the priest's house, the noise of a party of horsemen entering the village was heard. They stopped at every door, and inquired if a child ten years of age, wearing a white robe, had been seen in the village, and offered a large<pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6349-00000207"/> reward for her recovery. No one had seen such a fugitive, and after uttering a few oaths they went on and dismounted at the Abb Dumont's cottage.</p> 
               <p>The lights had been extinguished, and they knocked loud and long for admittance before it was gained. At length the priest appeared, and mildly asked:</p> 
               <p>"What would you have, friends? Why do you alarm my house thus, at this late hour of the night?"</p> 
               <p>"Because it suits us to do so," was the insolent reply of one of the intruders. "We were sent hither to find a child that has been stolen from the chateau. If you know anything of her, you had better make a clean breast of it, or it will be the worse for you."</p> 
               <p>"Friend, the Terror has ceased to reign; God is no longer repudiated in the land, and his ministers are again entitled to the respect they once claimed from all men. I resume my clerical character, and demand from you the obedience due to the Cur. Leave my domicile, and cease to insult me by your brutal accusations."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! but he takes a high tone," sneered one. "But that is not answering our question."</p> 
               <p>"Nor shall I condescend to answer it. Search my house and see if you can find the person you seek."</p> 
               <p>The priest struck a light, and placed a lamp upon the table. The men looked upon the bare walls, the uncovered floor, and the fire-place filled with pieces of half charred wood, which looked as if they had been undisturbed for months.</p> 
               <p>"There is nothing suspicious here-but there are other rooms."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-one that is occupied by my housekeeper, and a small one that serves me as my cell," replied the abb, coldly.</p> 
               <p>The men took the lamp and entered the old woman's chamber, who sat up in bed in a state of violent indignation at this intrusion; but they did not heed her exclamations; they looked through every part of the room, and satisfied themselves that no one was concealed within it. They then went to the other end of the building, and looked into the small closet which the priest had well called a cell. It had nothing in it but a mattress, a small table, and a cross, with a reading lamp placed near it. When they returned to the outer room, the abb asked:</p> 
               <p>"Why have you searched my house, when you have entered no other one in the village? and who is this child of whom you are in pursuit?"</p> 
               <p>"We came hither, citizen, because if any craft is to be used, a priest is always the person sought out to practise it. The child is a relation of our employer, and it is important to regain possession of her. If you will aid us, five thousand francs shall be your reward, if we recover her through your assistance."</p> 
               <p>"The servant of God does not barter his services for the lucre of gain. I have borne with your presence as long as is necessary to accomplish your errand, and you can now relieve me of it as soon as you may see fit. Midnight approaches, and I must go to my devotions."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Ta! ta!</emph> now you will have leave to pray in public, so you needn't do so much in the dark. But we will go, for it seems that we must look for our game in another quarter."</p> 
               <p>After a brief delay the party rode off, and after listening a few moments, the Abb drew near the chimney, sprung back the plate, and asked in a low tone:</p> 
               <p>"Little one, are you ill with fright?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, sir; I heard it all, but my courage did not fail me," replied the sweet voice of the child. "Now they are gone, shall we not soon leave?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes-before very long; sleep again, my child, and when the time comes, I will arouse you for the journey."</p> 
               <pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC6349-00000208"/> 
               <p>But Ida could not sleep. She sat up, and watched with feverish anxiety for the signal to leave her hiding-place. Dora soon returned, heard all that had passed, and spoke a few words of encouragement to the patient little captive. She then lay down on the housekeeper's bed, to snatch a few moments' repose before setting forth to the city.</p> 
               <p>The cart of the abb had a box under the seat, contrived by himself, for the safe transportation of articles that had been contraband during the troubled days of the revolution, and in this the little girl was to be placed. In the afternoon, while pretending to put in his load, he had bored a number of air holes in the sides of this box, and its depth was sufficient to afford room to a slender child like Ida, though her limbs would be a little cramped by the confinement.</p> 
               <p>At two o'clock their arrangements were all completed, and Dora drew the child from her place of concealment, and placed her in the narrow space assigned her. A folded coverlet was placed beneath her, and everything that could render her as little uncomfortable as possible was done. Ida was very tremulous, but she quietly submitted to lie down, and have the lid closed over her. A cloak was then thrown over the seat, carefully turned up at the sides to permit the air to circulate through her hiding-place. Dora presently whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Can you breathe freely, Ida? Is there air enough?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, quite enough. I can see the stars through the holes. Only let us get away, and I shall do well enough."</p> 
               <p>The baskets of vegetables were already placed in the cart, and in the rough blouse and slouched hat of the peasant, the Abb took his place beside Dora. With a hearty God speed from the housekeeper, they went on their way. The full moon was rising, and every object was as clearly visible as in day-light; as the cart jogged on they frequently spoke to the child, and found that she was awake and patient, in the hope of being soon restored to those she loved. The lid of the box was lifted several times to permit a thorough draft of fresh air to ventilate her hiding-place.</p> 
               <p>The city loomed in the distance in the first grey tints of approaching day before they encountered any obstruction. Suddenly a man started from the road-side and cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Halt there! who are you, and where are you going?"</p> 
               <p>"Can't you see for yourself?" replied the Abb, brusquely. "We are market people, bound for the city."</p> 
               <p>"Ho! ho! but maybe you carry something more precious than vegetables."</p> 
               <p>"You're welcome to look and see for yourself. Here are onions, carrots and cauliflowers. You will find nothing more valuable than these, I trow."</p> 
               <p>The man raised the cloth that covered the baskets, dropped it again and said:</p> 
               <p>"Sure enough-there's nothing suspicious there. Hark ye, citizen, have you seen anything of a lost child as you came along? I would reward any one nobly who could give me a clue to one I am in search of."</p> 
               <p>"A lost child? Is it a girl, or a boy?"</p> 
               <p>"A girl-a delicate little creature, in a white robe."</p> 
               <p>"No, citizen, I have overtaken no such child as you describe. Pardon me, but day is breaking, and I shall be late in getting to market."</p> 
               <p>The man stepped aside, and the vehicle rolled on; Dora quelled the rapid beating of her heart, and when it was safe to do so, spoke in a low voice to the poor child. She immediately replied:</p> 
               <p>"I heard all-oh, hurry on, or I shall die in this narrow place."</p> 
               <p>By this time a turn in the road had hidden them from their interrogator. The Abb whipped up his mule, and trotted rapidly toward the city. They passed the barriers<pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC6349-00000209"/> at last, and entered a badly lighted street. A fiacre was drawn up near the sidewalk, in which sat a muffled figure. A sign from the priest caused him to spring from his seat, and in another moment, Ida, half paralyzed by her long confinement, was lifted out, Dora sprang into the vehicle and received the child in her arms.</p> 
               <p>Morlaix, after exchanging a few words with the Abb, drove off at a furious pace, and in half an hour they reached the lodgings of De Vere. He was on the watch for their arrival, and with a stifled cry of gratitude he grasped his recovered treasure, and holding Dora by the hand, mounted rapidly to his rooms.</p> 
               <p>Helen, wild with joy, clasped her child and covered her with kisses; she then threw her arms around the stranger who had saved her, and uttered her thanks and blessings with hysterical rapidity.</p> 
               <p>"You have saved her-you have restored her to me, and henceforth you shall be to me as a sister. I claim you as the friend of my life."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, Lady De Vere," she gently replied-"I need friends, and such as yourself and your husband any one may be proud to claim."</p> 
               <p>She spoke in English, and the purity of her accent caused De Vere to say:</p> 
               <p>"You are then a countrywoman of ours?"</p> 
               <p>"Almost-I am an American, though for the last six years I have been a wanderer in Europe. Much of that time has been spent in France, and I am weary of the turmoil here. I need repose, and I wish to accompany you to England."</p> 
               <p>He smiled brightly as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"On one condition you shall go with us."</p> 
               <p>"And what is that?"</p> 
               <p>"That you will make our house your home; our purse your own."</p> 
                
               <p>"To the first, I answer yes-to the last, no, for I have resources of my own which suffice for my simple wants. I feel the need of a home, and I accept yours as frankly as it is offered."</p> 
               <p>Ida threw herself in her arms, and kissed her, and Dora felt repaid for all she had done. Mrs. Fitzhugh, who was with them, looked on this scene and wept, for her sufferings had brought her almost to a state of second childhood.</p> 
               <p>An early breakfast had been ordered, as the traveling carriage was to be at the door at nine o'clock, as Morlaix had followed the advice of the Abb and prepared everything for their departure. The interim was filled up with explanations, and Helen said:</p> 
               <p>"Alina-always Alina; she has indeed fulfilled her threat. But for you, dear friend, this last blow would have broken my heart. Tell me by what name I shall call my benefactress?"</p> 
               <p>"Those who love me, call me Sister Therse. I am not a nun, though my days are devoted to deeds of mercy," replied Dora, with a pensive smile.</p> 
               <p>"And this day you have performed one that entitles you to eternal happiness."</p> 
               <p>Breakfast was dispatched; at the appointed hour the carriage came to the door, and scarcely believing in their good fortune, the party of travelers found themselves beyond the barriers of the city in which they had suffered so much.</p> 
               <p>While uttering their congratulations to each other, a trace broke, the horses were stopped, and the driver got down to remedy the disaster. While they were thus detained, a child, meagre and wan with famine, with his clothes in tatters, and his brown hair matted in elf locks around a broad, clear brow, came to the door, and in faltering accents, said:</p> 
               <pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC6349-00000210"/> 
               <p>"Give me a few sous for the sake of the good God, for I am starving."</p> 
               <p>"Poor infant!" exclaimed Helen, with starting tears. "See, he seems ready to perish of want; and, oh, Reginald, he seems just the age our boy would have been. Where are your father and mother, little one?"</p> 
               <p>"I never had any," was the reply. "I lived in a large house with other children, but the soldiers drove us all away, and now I have no one to give me food."</p> 
               <p>"Good Heavens! Is not this too dreadful! A baby left to his own resources! Dear Reginald, our child has been given back to us, and we should do something to show our gratitude. Let us take this little waif, and provide for him."</p> 
               <p>"But it may lead to some difficulty about the passports," objected De Vere. "We had better leave him at the first cottage, with a sum of money sufficient to induce the people to receive him."</p> 
               <p>The child looked from one speaker to the other. Helen caught the gleam of his clear, blue eyes, and she suddenly said:</p> 
               <p>"My heart tells me to claim this child in the place of the one I have lost. Let me have my way in this, my dear husband; brave a little inconvenience to gratify me; for, oh! in spite of his rags and squalor, he reminds me of what our boy might have been at his age."</p> 
               <p>To this appeal De Vere could not reply by a refusal. The lad was placed on the box beside the coachman, and at their first stopping place, a bath, clean clothing, and wholesome food, restored to the little fellow all his natural vivacity. Dora superintended his toilet, and she discovered upon his shoulder a cypher, stamped by pricking the flesh deeply and rubbing in gunpowder. The letters were S. F. E., followed by a date, which they supposed to be that of his birth, as it corresponded with his apparent age.</p> 
                
               <p>Sir Reginald surmounted the difficulty at the passport office by simply stating the truth concerning the boy, and requesting permission to remove him to England, where he pledged himself to provide for him. Homeless and destitute children were then too numerous in France to cause any objection to be raised, and the little waif was taken to the castle, where he soon acquired the language he heard spoken around him.</p> 
               <p>The lad stated his name to be Jacques, but Lady De Vere, who felt herself hourly drawn more nearly toward him, insisted that he should be called Henry, that having been her father's name, and the second one bestowed in baptism upon her lost son.</p> 
               <p>With restored health, the boy proved to be both handsome and intelligent, and the passionate attachment he evinced for his protectress rendered him dearer to her with every passing day. As time passed on, Sir Reginald also came to regard him almost as a son, and as the child of his adoption, he resolved to educate and provide for him in the future.</p> 
               <p>Thus years lapsed away; the children grew in beauty, and showed the tenderest attachment for each other. Nothing was heard from Alina, and Helen almost ceased to fear her machinations against her happiness.</p> 
               <p>In France great changes had taken place. That wonderful man, Napoleon, had brought order out of the chaos of the revolution; he had assumed the government as first Consul, and was making rapid strides toward imperial power.</p> 
               <p>Sister Therse had visited France several times in pursuit of a friend she had lost, but as yet she had been unsuccessful in finding him. Her home was at Vere Castle, where she was beloved and cherished as the dearest of friends.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">NAPOLEON AS A MATCH-MAKER.</head> 
               <p>ON a bright day in autumn two ladies sat together in a saloon at Malmaison, and conversed with that freedom which the etiquette of a court had not yet destroyed. The windows looked out on an enchanting park, with a stream of water flashing in the distance.</p> 
               <p>A bridge which spanned the stream was covered in and arranged like a tent, and in this retreat the conqueror of Europe labored almost without intermission in the service of the nation he ruled.</p> 
               <p>A small private garden was attached to it, in which Napoleon walked when he felt the need of exercise, and there his great plans for the future were matured.</p> 
               <p>The ladies to whom we have referred were both young and lovely. Madame Louis Bonaparte was then in the first bloom of youth, and certainly a fresher or fairer looking creature could scarcely have been found. Her figure was supple and delicately rounded; her head, from which flowed a profusion of blonde curls, was gracefully set upon her shoulders, and her arms, hands and feet were models of beauty. She was extremely fair, with soft penetrating blue eyes, in which the soul of kindness dwelt, and a clear rose tint fluctuated on her transparent complexion as feeling or emotion were aroused.</p> 
               <p>Added to these attractions, she possessed a grace and suavity of manner which rendered her charming to all who approached her, for in Hortense Beauharnais was united the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nonchalance</foreign> of the creole with the cultivation and vivacity of the polished Frenchwoman.</p> 
               <p>Her companion was entirely different in style. She was a lovely brunette, with large soft black eyes, and hair of the same color, with an expression of pensive thought upon her regular features which seemed scarcely natural to her sparkling style of beauty. Her figure was tall and stately, and the hand in which she held a rose might have served as a model to a sculptor.</p> 
               <p>"My dear Agla," said Madame Louis, with vivacity, "I have set my heart on seeing you well married. Why do you refuse the attentions of our young cavaliers and hold yourself as distant as Diana herself?"</p> 
               <p>A bright glow flashed into the cheek of the young girl, which died away as, quickly as it had arisen, and in a low tone she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I shall never marry. I came to this determination in my childhood, and I have seen no one who could induce me to change it. The young generals who surround the First Consul have no attractions for me. They are gallant men, but they do not come up to my ideal."</p> 
               <p>The clear eyes of Hortense were turned full upon the speaker, and she asked with a smile:</p> 
               <p>"What then is your ideal, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chere?</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>Agla laughed.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, a grand and noble man; with courage that never falters, yet with a tenderness of heart that would lead him to help and soothe the humblest creature. His person must correspond with his soul, for a gem in a rough casket would not suit my fastidious taste."</p> 
               <p>"Well, for an idealist you are not very unreasonable. I believe that I can find one to realize your visionary man."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed! who can it possibly be? But mine is not a visionary man. I have known the original of my sketch; in my infancy he rescued me from a frightful peril, and to him I gave my childish heart. He is dead, and unless I can find his equal, I shall live and die as Agla St. Angeau."</p> 
               <pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC6349-00000212"/> 
               <p>"Who then was this wonderful man?"</p> 
               <p>"He was known to us as M. Michel, though my father suspected that was not his true name. He entered the French army, and was in a fair way to achieve distinction, when his life was cut short by an assassin. I was then but ten years old, but the blow nearly destroyed me. Oh, yes, Madame, child as I was, I loved him far better than I shall ever love another. Through all the vicissitudes and dangers that beset us in the days of the Terror, throughout all our wanderings, I managed to preserve a portrait of him which was painted by my mother, and from it I have had a miniature taken which I always wear next my heart."</p> 
               <p>"Sentimental child! Let me look at this souvenir; I wish to see if the hero to whom I wish to give you at all resembles him."</p> 
               <p>"To whom do you allude, Madame?"</p> 
               <p>"Show me the picture, Mademoiselle, and then I will tell you."</p> 
               <p>With some reluctance Agla drew from a gold case, and touching a spring, it opened and revealed a head of singular power and nobility of outline. Hortense uttered an exclamation, and rapidly said:</p> 
               <p>"Why, Agla, you have only been quizzing me. Do you already know General Ney?"</p> 
               <p>"Only through his fame. But why do you regard me so strangely? I have spoken the simple truth to you."</p> 
               <p>"And this picture, worn next your heart, is really not one of him? It is incredible, for the likeness is perfect. He is older now, and has a greater air of command, but at twenty this medallion might have been taken for him."</p> 
               <p>Agla pressed her hand upon her heart, and eagerly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who then is General Ney? What are his antecedents?"</p> 
                
               <p>"No one knows much of them, for like nearly all of our distinguished military men, he has risen by the force of his own genius. It is said that his father lives in Sarre Louis, and is a respectable mechanic there; but Ney has soared so far above his family that he can hold little intercourse with them-they have ceased to be of his world."</p> 
               <p>"Yet the tie of blood is strong, Madame; it should never be broken. Your hero has a flaw in his escutcheon, which his resemblance to <emph>my</emph> hero will not induce me to overlook."</p> 
               <p>"My dear Agla, no one accuses the General of unkindness to his family. On the contrary, he is extremely liberal toward them; but if you should become Madame Ney, I think you will be well contented that he shall give them money, in place of removing them from their true sphere and attempting to drag them upward with himself. They would only clog the wings of the eagle, and prevent him from soaring to the height he is bound to gain. The first Consul already regards General Ney as his right hand, and no distinction will be too great for him if he pursues his career as he has commenced it."</p> 
               <p>"Agla laughed merrily:</p> 
               <p>"And you have really formed the design of bestowing my hand on this magnificent cavalier? Dear Madame Louis, what claim have I to such preferment?"</p> 
               <p>"You have youth, beauty and fortune; what more can even General Ney ask in the wife he may choose?"</p> 
               <p>"But he may not choose a wife at all. I have heard that he is nearly forty, and still unmarried."</p> 
               <p>"I should scarcely believe him to be over thirty, and besides he is eminently handsome, with that air of distinction which stamps itself on men of a high order of genius. The First Consul wishes his generals to marry, and with their wives form a sort of court around himself. He has signified this desire to General Ney, and-shall I tell you his reply?"</p> 
               <pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6349-00000213"/> 
               <p>Mademoiselle St. Angeau changed color, and looked uneasy. She quickly said:</p> 
               <p>"Pray do so, if I am interested in it."</p> 
               <p>"You are more deeply interested in it than any one else, for he said that among the beauties of the Consulate but one had any charms for him. That one was Mademoiselle St. Angeau; and if she could be induced to accept his devotion, he might think of marrying."</p> 
               <p>Agla listened in astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"General Ney can never have seen me, I am sure. If we had ever met, I must have remembered him from the resemblance you say he bears to this picture. It is very strange that he should have selected one so utterly a stranger to him."</p> 
               <p>"He has seen you at the theatre. He was present on the night the First Consul's life was in such imminent danger; he remarked your bearing on that occasion, and came to the conclusion that you would make a fitting wife for a hero. Now you know all I can tell you. I undertook to prepare you for the overtures of the general, at the request of the First Consul himself."</p> 
               <p>Agla listened in great perturbation. She had no wish to marry, and she feared the imperious will of Bonaparte, which already made itself felt on those that surrounded him. She was the chosen friend of Madame Louis, and warmly attached to her; Hortense still formed a part of her mother's household, and Agla knew that a refusal from her to receive this new pretender to her favor would be punished by banishment from Malmaison. After a painful pause, she said:</p> 
               <p>"I will think of this, Madame; and after consulting with my parents, I will cause my decision to be made known to the First Consul. Thank you for the kindness which induced you to undertake this mission. Let the affair end as it will, I trust that it will make no difference in our friendship."</p> 
               <p>"None, my dear; for I feel that it will end as I wish," was the tranquil response. "Only see your new lover, let him plead his own cause, and I answer for the result."</p> 
               <p>Tears sprang to Agla's eyes, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Madame, you do not comprehend how fanatically I have devoted myself to a memory; how fondly I have cherished the image that first impressed my childish fancy. I admit that you have awakened in me a desire to see this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">preux chevalier,</foreign> who so strangely resembles my early friend. I will not refuse to receive him, for the wish of the First Consul must be regarded as a command by me, but I cannot promise to give him my hand."</p> 
               <p>"No-not until he asks it," replied Hortense, gaily; "and, as I live, he is at this moment crossing the park in company with Napoleon. They are coming in this direction, and you will soon be able to judge yourself if General Hey resembles your cherished picture."</p> 
               <p>Agla became very pale as she asked:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Madame, was not this meeting arranged beforehand? Have you not drawn me into a snare?"</p> 
               <p>"By no means. Napoleon knows your father's livery, and while the carriage waits, he knows that you must be with me. The general has come to see him on business, which he interrupts to present him to you."</p> 
               <p>"Then there is absolutely no escape?"</p> 
               <p>"None-unless you make an ignominious flight before the conquering hero comes. Recall your color and your smiles, dear Agla; there is nothing formidable in being presented to a man who, at present, only asks to be received as a friend. Leave the future to take care of itself, and be your own charming, fascinating self again."</p> 
               <p>A bright flush stole to the cheek of the young girl as<pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC6349-00000214"/> she watched the approach of the two figures upon the lawn. Napoleon, in his plain gray suit, and military hat, was already familiar to her, and the stately looking man who walked beside him, in the rich uniform of a French general, lost nothing by being brought in comparison with the greatest man of his day. There was an air of deference toward his companion, which did not derogate from the self-respect and independence of character which was read in every line of his noble face, in every movement of his powerful frame.</p> 
               <p>As he drew nearer, a sudden trembling seized Mademoiselle St. Angeau, and she murmured:</p> 
               <p>"It is incredible. I remember Michel as he walked to and fro upon our lawn, and the very movements of this stranger are the same. Yet, it is impossible. Michel is in his grave, and this man cannot be he, in spite of this marvellous resemblance."</p> 
               <p>By a violent effort she controlled herself, and stood calm and self-possessed when the First Consul and General Ney were announced. The former advanced, and presented his companion to the two ladies; then, pinching Agla's ear, he said, in a low tone:</p> 
               <p>"I have brought my greatest hero to lay his trophies at your feet, Mademoiselle. See that you receive them as becomes his deserts. Ah, I know that you will encourage no lovers, but this time, nay will bear the alteration of a letter, and I shall congratulate you, as Madame Ney. No reply, if you please, Mademoiselle, for I have decided that it shall be so, and I am not used to contradiction when I have set my heart on a thing."</p> 
               <p>"It seems to me, General, that you are assuming the imperial style," said the young girl, with slight hauteur. "My parents are the persons to be consulted in the disposal of their only child."</p> 
                
               <p>Napoleon regarded her searchingly, and a slight frown contracted his brow; but he laughed, and said:</p> 
               <p>"All in good time, Mademoiselle. I show you the prize; set your cap in its most becoming fashion, for I assure you he is worth winning."</p> 
               <p>There was something so quizzical in his expression, that Agla could not resist a smile, and at that moment her eye caught that of Ney, who had been talking with Madame Louis with that air of chivalrous gallantry seldom found among the distinguished military men that surrounded Napoleon.</p> 
               <p>The look sent a strange thrill through her heart; she replied with evident effort to the few words he addressed to her, and her fluctuating color, her faltering voice, showed him that she was deeply moved.</p> 
               <p>"Can it be possible that she remembers me yet?" he thought; and unconsciously his voice took a tender inflection as he continued to speak to her.</p> 
               <p>The two spectators remarked this agitation on the part of the usually calm and self-possessed Agla with secret triumph; for the proposed union was a project of Hortense's, into which the First Consul had eagerly entered. Mademoiselle St Angeau was a favorite with him; Ney was one of his most trusted friends, and the present interview had been adroitly planned between them.</p> 
               <p>In a few moments Agla recovered her usual dignified self-possession, and conversed with her new acquaintance with the ease of one accustomed to society. Napoleon and Madame Louis joined in the conversation, and Ney was charmed by the graceful sallies of the young girl. To the banter of the First Consul she returned such replies as made him feel that the game was not entirely in his own hands, and he enjoyed the racy independence which gave her courage to retort on him in his own vain of pleasantry. Half an hour slipped away, and Napoleon suddenly said:</p> 
               <pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC6349-00000215"/> 
               <p>"Come, General, we have played the part of idlers long enough in this hall of Circe. Let us return to the business of life."</p> 
               <p>With a significant glance at Agla, he whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Do not break your heart, Mademoiselle, for you shall see my friend ere long in your father's house."</p> 
               <p>They made their adieux, and left the two ladies together. Unconscious that she was observed by her companion, Agla watched the receding form of him who had so deeply impressed her. Hortense laughingly said:</p> 
               <p>"It has happened as I predicted, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chre.</foreign> You are struck with this noble and handsome man, and you will at last consent to embrace the destiny of your sex. You will become a happy and honored wife."</p> 
               <p>The face of Agla crimsoned, and she hastily said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Madame, this is jumping to conclusions rather too rapidly. General Ney is a remarkable man; he is one any woman may be proud to win, but my interest in him arises from his inexplicable resemblance to one who lies in an obscure grave. While we spoke together, it seemed to me that my lost friend stood before me-older, but not graver than in those early days; for Michel had known great suffering, and my childish caresses first brought smiles to his sad lips, after the blow that struck him to the earth."</p> 
               <p>"What, then, was the source of his sorrow?"</p> 
               <p>"We never knew; he carefully concealed his past life. We only knew him as our benefactor, and as one possessing the noblest and tenderest of souls. After the service to which I have referred, he frequently visited our chateau, and became one of our best friends."</p> 
               <p>"Tell me of this exploit. How did he rescue you, and from what danger?"</p> 
               <p>Agla, with vivid eloquence, related the escape of the leopard, and the gallant attack made on him by Rudolph. Hortense listened with intense interest, and when the recital was finished, she said:</p> 
               <p>"This is just such an act as the daring courage of Ney would lead him to perform. Napoleon has remarked him in the front of battle, and he says that such cool impassive skill and valor as he exhibits is unequalled even among the brave warriors who have won their laurels under his leadership. Weigh well what I have said, Agla, and do not permit a romantic dream to mar the brilliant destiny that may be yours."</p> 
               <p>Agla smiled faintly, made some light reply, and soon afterwards took leave of her friend to return to her father's hotel in Paris.</p> 
               <p>Wrapped in strange perplexity, alarmed at the new and thrilling emotions that assailed her, she recalled the expression of the eyes that had lately rested on her, and feared to analyze the new feelings that had been aroused in her heart. During the horrors of the French Revolution, M. St. Angeau, like many other wealthy landed proprietors in France, had been driven from his chateau, which was plundered and burned.</p> 
               <p>After trying many vicissitudes, in which he narrowly escaped the all-devouring guillotine, he made his escape with his wife and daughter to Geneva, where they lived till the restoration of order in his native country. Then he returned to France, gathered up the wreck of his fortune, and became a banker in Paris. He possessed much financial talent, and soon became conspicuous for his daring and success. Wealth flowed in apace, and now he occupied a handsome hotel in Paris, and lived in a style of elegance suited to his prosperous fortunes.</p> 
               <p>Agla St. Angeau and Hortense Beauharnais had been placed in the same school, and there the intimacy sprung up which resulted in a warm attachment between them;<pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC6349-00000216"/> though until this day, Agla had never before spoken so freely of her childish romance. Hortense vaguely knew that some tender memory prevented her friend from responding to the overtures of the lovers which her beauty and fortune drew around her; but how deep a hold this past affection had upon her heart she was far from comprehending.</p> 
               <p>Agla sprang up the steps which led to her mother's apartments, entered her exquisitely furnished boudoir, and threw herself in the maternal arms with a burst of emotion that alarmed her.</p> 
               <p>"What is it, my daughter? What has happened to excite you thus," tenderly inquired Madame St. Angeau.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mamma, I have seen Michel's wraith; a man who looks, speaks, moves as he did, yet he cannot be the same. I feel like one who has been walking in a dream for the last few hours."</p> 
               <p>"Michel! Ah, I hoped that fantasy had passed away, Agla. It is not well to let a phantom from the dead stand between you and happiness. Your father and I think it quite time for you to be settled in life, and he is becoming impatient at your refusal of so many eligible offers of marriage. He was with me but now, and spoke with displeasure of your rejection of Count D'Ernonville. He is young, handsome, and of ancient family; what more can you ask in the husband you may choose?"</p> 
               <p>"Only to be able to love him," replied Agla, with some bitterness. "Why shall I be forced to marry, when I already have all that is necessary to my happiness? Since you and my father are so anxious to get rid of your only child, I promise to accept the next suitor that presents himself. There, Madame, I hope that will satisfy you."</p> 
               <p>She threw herself back upon her chair, pale and excited, and her mother regarded her with astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Agla, never before have you spoken to me in this manner ner. What has happened to you, my child? The next suitor may be one your father and I will not approve, so make no rash pledges."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I do not, Madame. I have seen my new admirer; he wears the semblance of my early friend; and if my heart ever responds to love, it will be to that which he offers me. General Ney has seen me in public, he was presented to me this morning by the First Consul himself, and I have reason to believe that he will soon seek the acquaintance of my father and yourself."</p> 
               <p>"General Ney is a gallant man, and a distinguished officer, but he has risen from the people, and the young count would have been a more suitable match for a St. Angeau. Though your father is now a banker, Agla, I do not forget that we are of as good blood as any family in France."</p> 
               <p>"True, ma'ma," replied Agla, tranquilly, "but events have changed all that. A man of the people rules France, who has summoned around him a band of heroes that carry all before them. General Ney looks far more like a prince than did the late King of France, if his portraits do him justice. His origin is veiled in the splendor of his achievements, and since it is your will that I marry, you must accept this plebeian as your son, or do without one."</p> 
               <p>"Child, I do not know you under this new phase of character. Why should you resent the natural desire of your parents to replace you in the sphere in which you were born! Count D'Ernonville can give you rank and position; he is of the ancient noblesse, and he is an excellent young man besides."</p> 
               <p>"Oh yes-mawkish as a goblet of sweetened water. I will not marry the count, but if General Ney asks my hand I will give it to him. I do not place this noble, self-made man on a level with the dainty aristocrat, who seeks me because my probable fortune will restore the tarnished lustre<pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC6349-00000217"/> tre of his own. If I accept a husband at all, it shall be one worthy of the sacrifice I make to your wishes and those of my father."</p> 
               <p>Agla arose, swept out of the room, and went to her own apartment to draw forth the miniature she had shown Madame Louis, dream over it, and marvel at the tender interest with which she already regarded the stranger who so strongly resembled it. A secret attraction which she could not fathom, seem to draw her toward this acquaintance of a few hours' standing, and she felt a sort of self-contempt that already, in spirit, she had broken her vow to the dead.</p> 
               <p>Agla appeared at dinner paler than usual, but most becomingly dressed, and her father viewed her toilette with approbation. Toward the close of the repast, M. St. Angeau said:</p> 
               <p>"I expect a call from a very distinguished man this evening, and it is my wish to present him to you, and to my daughter, Madame. I hope you have no engagement which will take you from home?"</p> 
               <p>"We had one, but I have sent an excuse, as Agla declines going out."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better, for General Ney is not a person to be slighted, and I wish to offer him the hospitalities of my house."</p> 
               <p>"General Ney! Is he to be our guest?"</p> 
               <p>"Is there anything extraordinary in that? Nearly all the Republican generals have been received here; and as he comes to me with an introduction from the First Consul himself, I shall extend to him every courtesy that lies in my power."</p> 
               <p>Madame St. Angeau glanced toward her daughter, but she sat calm and impassive. She comprehended that beneath that quiet exterior lay a deep resolve, and, with a sigh, she gave up the hope of calling the young count her son. She was a tender and judicious mother, and she soon reconciled herself to her disappointment, with the consoling thought that her daughter would at last marry-that her future husband was one of the rising men of the day, whose fame would compensate for lack of high birth.</p> 
               <p>When they were again alone, she tenderly kissed Agla, who comprehended from this action that her mother conceded to her the right to fix her own destiny. She returned the caress, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"You will see your future son to-night, mamma, and I know beforehand that you will like him."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BETROTHAL.</head> 
               <p>M. ST. ANGEAU was alone in his private sanctum when a servant announced General Ney. He advanced to meet his guest, and as the light fell upon his features he started back, and surveyed him with an expression of surprise and doubt. Recovering himself, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, Monsieur, but your air and manner brought a deceased friend so vividly to my memory, that for an instant I could have believed him before me. You are welcome beneath my roof, General, as are all the gallant defenders of France."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, M. St. Angeau; it is my desire to be well received by you, for you hold in your hands my future happiness."</p> 
               <p>The voice of the speaker was slightly tremulous, and he was evidently much moved. St. Angeau listened with surprise, but he courteously said:</p> 
               <pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC6349-00000218"/> 
               <p>"What can I do to serve the friend of the Ruler of France? I do not know in what manner I can be instrumental in promoting your happiness, Monsieur."</p> 
               <p>"I have seen your daughter, and I came hither to ask your permisson to woo her as my future wife?"</p> 
               <p>The father smiled, and then a cloud flitted over his brow."</p> 
               <p>"General, my daughter is a singularly capricious young creature. She has refused many brilliant offers, and declares her intention to remain single. I have combatted this idea in vain, and I despair of gaining her consent to give her hand to any one."</p> 
               <p>"Why is this? Has any previous disappointment caused this resolution on the part of so charming a woman as Mademoiselle St. Angeau?" asked Ney, with emotion, for he felt as if the child he had so tenderly loved should, in her fair maturity, belong to himself alone.</p> 
               <p>"It results from no serious entanglement. A mere childish fancy for one who saved her life many years ago, induces my daughter to devote herself to his memory. The person I refer to is dead, but Agla is peculiar, and she chooses to cherish his memory to the exclusion of any living lover."</p> 
               <p>While M. St. Angeau thus spoke, he earnestly regarded his companion. The light that flashed from his eyes, the smile that swept over his expressive mouth, revealed the exultation with which this assurance was received. Ney decisively said:</p> 
               <p>"With your permission, I will endeavor to win the heart of your daughter; this childish memory cannot be so tenacious as to preclude all hope of success."</p> 
               <p>"If any one can do this, General, it is yourself; for you are marvellously like the friend of whom I have spoken. Nay-it seems impossible that you should not be the same. Michel, why do you wear a mask to me? What is the mystery of your life? If you really seek to gain the hand of my daughter, why should you shrink from revealing your identity to one who is bound to you by such deep obligations?"</p> 
               <p>Ney frankly grasped the hand that was extended to him, and his voice vibrated with deep feeling as he said:</p> 
               <p>"I sought to woo your daughter as General Ney, but as Michel I alone would have married her. I wished, for a season, to maintain my incognito, but you have penetrated it, and now I have only to relate to you the singular series of events which have placed me in my present position; but this must be done under the strictest pledge of secresy."</p> 
               <p>"Assuredly, if you wish it. But why have you so long consented to remain as dead to your best friends?"</p> 
               <p>"That has been a source of bitter regret to me; but the course I pursued was imposed on me by imperative necessity. Listen to the story I have to relate, and then you will comprehend all the difficulties of my position."</p> 
               <p>The two drew their seats nearer together, and in low earnest tones Ney related the strange incidents which led to his adoption of his present name, and gave him a captain's commission in the French army. He then lightly sketched his career since that epoch; it had been signalized by many brilliant services to the country, for which he had been rewarded by the high rank he now bore.</p> 
               <p>When he had finished M. St. Angeau said:</p> 
               <p>"It is a strange, wild story; but I do not see how you could have acted differently toward your friends. Your secret was too important to be left at the discretion of others. But how have you managed with reference to the family of your deceased cousin? Have they never suspected anything?"</p> 
               <p>"My life has been too busy to afford me an opportunity<pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC6349-00000219"/> to visit them, and you can readily comprehend that I was not anxious to be brought in contact with those before whom I should have been compelled to play a part. I have been liberal to them; more so, perhaps, than their son would have been, for I felt that I had a debt to cancel. And now that all has been satisfactorily explained, what answer do you make to my proposal for the hand of your daughter?"</p> 
               <p>"Only win Agla's consent, and you have mine," was the frank response. "Your supposed death nearly cost the poor child her own life, for she was ill for months after the news arrived. I believe the picture her mother painted of you has been the shrine of her devotions ever since. In all our vicissitudes she managed to preserve it, and it still hangs in her chamber."</p> 
               <p>Ney listened with rapture. He said:</p> 
               <p>"Ah! how sweet is this new hope that dawns on my weary and broken life. In my youth I loved with desperation a woman who crushed my self-respect-who trampled on my bleeding heart, and inflicted on me the most exquisite torture. The sweet voice of the child I saved first awoke me from the torpor of despair, and I loved her as the messenger of peace and hope. I have cherished her in my soul as its good angel; I scarcely hoped to meet her again; but a few weeks ago I saw her at the theatre. I felt attracted by her, I could not tell why, for, lovely as she is, there were others as fair around her. I enquired her name, and then I knew that Fate had led me to her presence again. The past love is buried, M. St. Angeau, and your daughter is now the only woman on earth that I would willingly marry. I will endeavor to make her happy, if I am so fortunate as to gain her affections."</p> 
               <p>"I feel assured of that, my dear General; and now shall we join the ladies?"</p> 
                
               <p>"If you please."</p> 
               <p>"Is it your wish to maintain your incognito toward them?"</p> 
               <p>"For a season, at least. If I succeed with Agla, you can communicate to them the secret I have confided to you-if she refuses me, it will be useless to reveal my identity."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! the knowledge of that will almost ensure your success."</p> 
               <p>"It may be so; but I wish to see if Agla is gifted with your penetration. The eye of love should be at least as searching as that of friendship."</p> 
               <p>"She will detect you, be sure of that; for now I look at you closely, hear your voice, I can see only the Michel of former days. You are many years older; but they have passed lightly over you, and you are handsomer than in your early youth."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that is a consoling assurance to a man who aspires to become a bridegroom. Let us seek the ladies. The glimpse I had of Agla this morning only increases my desire to see more of her."</p> 
               <p>"You have seen her, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Are you not aware that the First Consul presented me to her this morning at Malmaison?"</p> 
               <p>"And the sly gipsy said nothing of it to me, although I told her at dinner that you would call this evening. There is something unusual in this, for Agla is ordinarily as frank as a child, and speaks of what interests her without reserve. Come at once, for I am curious to see the meeting between you."</p> 
               <p>M. St. Angeau led the way to the drawing-room, in which he found his wife and daughter. Agla was playing on the harp, but she turned with perfect self-possession to greet the visitor. Madame St. Angeau, prepared for the resemblance between Ney and their former friend, betrayed<pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC6349-00000220"/> no emotion, and M. St. Angeau was disappointed in the effect he expected their entrance to produce.</p> 
               <p>Agla seemed to awake to new and more vivid life in the presence of this stranger, for her parents had never before seen her so brilliant and fascinating as on this evening. She seemed inspired with eloquence, and when she sang, at Ney's request, her pure voice sounded as the echo of a happy spirit suddenly released from doubts and fears that had long oppressed it. He listened as one entranced, and as her hand fell from the harp-strings, he took it in his own and earnestly said:</p> 
               <p>"I cannot feel as a stranger to you, Mademoiselle. It seems to me that, in some former state of being, we must have known and appreciated each other."</p> 
               <p>Agla drew back her hand with an air of reserve; but suddenly her eye fell upon a small mole on his temple, from which he had pushed back his hair. She uttered a faint cry, clasped his hand in both her own, and vehemently said:</p> 
               <p>"My heart has not deceived me. Yes, we have known each other, but it was on this earth; though why you have played so cruel a part toward the friends that loved you I cannot understand."</p> 
               <p>Their eyes met in one lightning glance, and he whispered in a voice of deep emotion:</p> 
               <p>"Agla, do you indeed recognize me? Will you consent to love me as you did the Michel of other days?"</p> 
               <p>"Then you are indeed he?" and she sunk upon a seat completely unnerved by the discovery she had so suddenly made.</p> 
               <p>In her childhood Agla had often toyed with his hair, and the small brown mark which had betrayed him had often been observed by her. M. St. Angeau was watching them, and Ney made a sign to him which he immediately understood stood. He saw that an explanation was about to take place, and he considerately withdrew his wife that he might give her the clue to what was passing.</p> 
               <p>Madame St. Angeau listened in amazement, and with difficulty her husband prevented her from rushing back to claim her old friend and welcome him to her house.</p> 
               <p>When they were left alone, Ney leaned over the half fainting Agla and tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, dearest Agla, I am that Michel who was once permitted by Heaven to rescue you from imminent peril. Tell me that I then saved the joy and hope of my life and I shall be the happiest of men."</p> 
               <p>The young girl impulsively drew from her bosom the medallion she had that morning shown to Madame Louis Bonaparte, and smiled brightly as she said:</p> 
               <p>"Look-behold yourself, and know that I have vowed from childhood that I would be true to the original."</p> 
               <p>He cast one rapid glance upon the miniature, clasped her to his heart, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Then you will be mine? I can explain all that is past to your satisfaction. I have already done so to your father, and he brought me himself to test the power of your memory."</p> 
               <p>She extricated herself from his embrace, and stood tearful and blushing before him.</p> 
               <p>"I have perfect faith in your honor. I can trust you with all that is most precious to me, and I answer that the wish of Napoleon shall not be thwarted. I give you my hand, and with it the heart that has always clung to you."</p> 
               <p>"And I accept it as the most precious boon that fortune can bestow. Oh, my life was once laid desolate by a demon; but now an angel will chant the song of love in my home, and my heart shall cherish her more dearly than it ever did that fair syren who wrought me such bitter woe."</p> 
               <pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC6349-00000221"/> 
               <p>"Bury that memory in oblivion, and let us plant flowers over its grave," said Agla with an enchanting smile. "I can well remember that you were a man of sorrow; that my childish wiles brought back smiles to your lips, as I will now bring back joy to your heart."</p> 
               <p>"That you have already accomplished, my sweet love. In this hour, I would not exchange my fate for that of any living man. Oh, to feel that the one we love is worthy of perfect trust, is sweetest balm to the heart that has suffered from treachery as mine has suffered."</p> 
               <p>A smile of ineffable tenderness beamed from Agla's eyes, as she led him to a sofa, and seated herself beside him. Then she playfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I am a genuine daughter of Eve, and I am impatient to learn the history of your life since we last met. Tell me all, for even the most minute incident that concerns you, will have deep interest for me."</p> 
               <p>An hour was passed in explanations, during which many digressions were made, and then Ney asked:</p> 
               <p>"Will you now bear the name I have won and made glorious for your sake? For in my heart a tender presentiment ever lingered that I should again find you, and claim you as the jewel of my life."</p> 
               <p>She navely said:</p> 
               <p>"I feel as if I of right belong to you. Such has ever been my feeling, and this it was which prevented me from accepting the offers of others. My heart comes to you in all the purity and singleness of a first love; see how perfect is my confidence in you, for I speak as freely to you as in those infantile days when you bore me in your arms, and endured all my teazing, tantalizing ways with the patience of a martyr."</p> 
               <p>"Say rather all your angelic wiles to bring back smiles to the weary lips that closed upon the despair that was in my heart. Dearest Agla, you have indeed been an angel of hope and blessedness to me."</p> 
               <p>"And that early life, Michel?" she tenderly asked. "What was that sorrow which bore so heavily upon you? Have I not the right to know it?"</p> 
               <p>"The time will come, Agla, when I can tell you all; but not now. In this hour ask me not to recall the anguish of those days; it would be like placing a death's head amid a feast of flowers. I will not now sadden your heart and my own, by the recital of that which I would gladly cast into oblivion. Let us contemplate the bright future that opens before us, and forget the dark and tortuous path through which it has been gained."</p> 
               <p>M. St. Angeau became impatient at this long interview, and at length he came in, and drew near the lovers. Ney arose to meet him, and grasped his hand, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"Your daughter's penetration proved equal to your own, my friend. She knew me, though by what token she has not yet explained."</p> 
               <p>Agla also arose, and pointed to the mole upon his temple. She said:</p> 
               <p>"My heart had already recognized you before I saw that betraying mark. I was then assured of what I had before suspected."</p> 
               <p>"Then my daughter has at last found her true mate?" asked M. St. Angeau, with a smile.</p> 
               <p>"We ask your blessing," replied Ney, drawing Agla's hand within his own. "We have come to an understanding, and Mademoiselle St. Angeau will be my wife."</p> 
               <p>"And you ask mine too, I hope," said a sweet voice which vibrated with emotion, and Madame St. Angeau advanced from the adjoining apartment. "Dear Michel, I know all, and I pardon you for your long silence, though we have mourned you as dead. But you have come back to us, and all is well."</p> 
               <pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC6349-00000222"/> 
               <p>Ney took the hand she offered, and pressing it to his lips, spoke with deep emotion:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Madame, your generous goodness overwhelms me. I ask you for the darling of your heart, but I will not take her from you. I only ask to be received as a son who will make the happiness of your child the study of his life."</p> 
               <p>"And I fully comprehend that my daughter is most fortunate in the choice she has made," replied the mother.</p> 
               <p>"And I ratify the contract," said M. St. Angeau, with joyful pride. Agla was right to wait till the true man appeared; though I have often been impatient with her coldness and caprice toward the pretenders to her favor. Come, let us sit down, and cozily talk over what has happened, and what must soon follow in the train of these events."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Ney-"I have a few weeks of leisure, and my happiness must not be delayed. Make my life complete by giving me my bride as soon as may be."</p> 
               <p>Agla ventured a few faint objections to this haste, but they were overruled, and it was settled that in two weeks the marriage should take place. In a few days their betrothal should be announced to the First Consul, and thus become known to the circle to which they belonged.</p> 
               <p>Supper was announced, and four happier hearts have seldom gathered around the evening meal. The lovers felt that they had at last gained the bourne of peace for which they had so long sighed, and the parents were elated by the brilliant future which lay before their beloved child. As the wife of a distinguished military chieftain, they knew that her position would be far more eligible than even as a countess of the ancient rgime, and they were also warmly attached to their proposed son-in-law.</p> 
               <p>They separated at a late hour, with a promise from Ney to dine with them on the following day; and Agla went to her room to muse over the incidents of the evening, and to give up her heart to the great and unexpected happiness which had so suddenly dawned upon her.</p> 
               <p>She compared her cherished picture with the original as he now appeared, and decided in her own mind that Ney was far handsomer than the sad-looking Michel of other days.</p> 
               <p>Every hour that the lover could spare from the business which brought him to Paris was devoted to his betrothed, and it was not until the third day after her betrothal that Agla found time to drive to Malmaison to inform her friend, Madame Louis, of what had taken place. At the same time Ney went to announce his approaching marriage to the First Consul.</p> 
               <p>Napoleon heard it with surprise, and merrily said:</p> 
               <p>"By my faith, General, you storm ladies' hearts as expeditiously as you take the enemy's batteries. This young lady has hitherto refused all lovers, yet you, like Csar, can say, 'I came, I saw, I conquered."</p> 
               <p>"Such has been my good fortune, my General; but Madame Louis can probably explain to you that I owe my success to a strong resemblance between myself and one to whom Mademoiselle St. Angeau has been attached from her infancy."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, well, women are strange riddles, and the sentimental ones the most incomprehensible of all. But Mademoiselle St. Angeau is a clever girl, and I think will not be less true as a wife because she has cherished absurd fancies. You will cure her of all these, and make her a sensible woman."</p> 
               <p>The listener smiled, but he did not explain that he owed his happiness to those very fancies which rendered Agla different from the most of her sex.</p> 
               <p>When Agla, with many blushes, and much internal<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC6349-00000223"/> perturbation, revealed to her friend that she was already won by a man Hortense believed to have been known to her but a few days, she was relieved by the sweet and womanly manner with which her communication was received. Madame Louis kissed and congratulated her on the choice she had made, without referring to the brief wooing. She spoke only of the future, and the happiness in store for the bride elect, and Agla parted from her with a stronger feeling of attachment for her than she had ever felt before.</p> 
               <p>As she was taking leave, Hortense said:</p> 
               <p>"There will be a grand reception at the Tuilleries this week, and you must appear there with your betrothed. Ah, dear Agla, many hearts will envy you the noble and handsome cavalier you have chosen."</p> 
               <p>"Or, rather, who has chosen me. I shall certainly come, and on that occasion my dress shall be something unique. I shall wear it as a delicate compliment to him who so strongly resembles him to whom I owe my life."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE LIFE-CURSE REAPPEARS.</head> 
               <p>MADAME BONAPARTE, in anticipation of the state she was soon to assume, resided in the ancient palace of the Kings of France. Josephine was still a beautiful woman, and her unrivalled taste in dress set off her charms to the best advantage. On this evening she wore a regal robe of purple velvet embroidered with gold, and a head-dress of emerald sprays, mixed with golden ears of wheat. She sat in an arm-chair at the upper end of the reception-room, surrounded by the members of her husband's family.</p> 
                
               <p>Conspicuous among them was the lovely Pauline, in the dress of a Greek Bacchante, which admirably set off her perfect beauty. Madame Murat, with her rose-tinted complexion, fine as satin, and her sweet expression, stood near her sister, and on the other side were Hortense, and the wife of Lucien Bonaparte.</p> 
               <p>The First Consul, with his brilliant staff of officers, occupied a position nearer the door of the saloon, and the plain gray dress of Napoleon contrasted strangely with the gay crowd by which he was surrounded; yet a stranger suddenly introduced into the apartment would at once have detected that in this unostentatious figure centred the chief interest of the scene.</p> 
               <p>Napoleon, with his grand head, and eagle eye, seemed to tower above those around him in spite of his small stature when compared with that of the magnificent Murat and others who stood near him. This man, crowned with genius and daring, knew that he held the fate of France in the hollow of his hand, and his bearing showed that he was master, though there was nothing arrogant or supercilious in his manner. He eminently possessed the power to win hearts, and although many saw whither his ambition tended, no effort was made to clip the wings of the imperial eagle as he soared upward to grasp the glittering prize of a crown.</p> 
               <p>Ney, with his handsome face, and stately form, was amid the group that surrounded the First Consul, and he listened anxiously for the announcement of M. St. Angeau, with his wife and daughter. The saloon was already crowded, but an open space was kept clear for the approach of new guests to pay their respects to the wife of the ruler of France.</p> 
               <p>At length those for whom the lover had so long watched made their appearance, and an exclamation escaped him as he saw Agla's dress.</p> 
               <pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC6349-00000224"/> 
               <p>She wore a white cashmere robe, trimmed with bands of plush, woven in imitation of the mottled skin of the leopard, over which fell a tunic adorned with the same material. This was clasped upon the shoulders with cameos of great beauty, on which were cut the couchant form of a leopard. The white and rounded arms were adorned with bracelets to match, and her wealth of raven hair was bound around her graceful head with a bandeau of the same jewels.</p> 
               <p>In this severely simple toilette she looked like a muse, and a murmur of admiration greeted her appearance; but she passed on, with the serene dignity that distinguished her, and made her obeisance before the elegant Josephine. The latter arose from her seat, and offered her congratulations to Mademoiselle St. Angeau on her approaching marriage. They were received by Agla with a blushing grace that rendered her still more charming in the eyes of the gentlemen present, and it was soon circulated through the crowd that the reserved and proud Diana had at last found one she considered worthy of her love.</p> 
               <p>The fame of the gallant Ney was known to all present, though few were personally acquainted with him, for his life had been too active in the service of the country to afford him much time to mingle in the gaieties of Paris. When it became known that the distinguished-looking chieftain who stood near Napoleon was the betrothed of Mademoiselle St. Angeau, she became the centre of a brilliant crowd, who vied with each other in flattering the young girl who had become the object of his choice.</p> 
               <p>Ney was endeavoring to obtain a glimpse of his betrothed, when another announcement was made:</p> 
               <p>"The Baron and Baroness Maretsky;" and the crowd opened to admit a tall man, with tawny hair and whiskers, on whose arm leaned a gorgeous figure, glittering in a blaze of diamonds.</p> 
                
               <p>Madame Maretsky advanced with the stately and assured step of one accustomed to such scenes, but suddenly her eyes fell upon the face of one who stood beside Napoleon, and her face, even her lips, blanched to the hue of death. She tottered, grasped the arm of her husband, and muttered:</p> 
               <p>"I am faint-the crowd overcomes me-take me away!"</p> 
               <p>Ney, who had been watching Agla, had not looked toward the newly-arrived guests; but suddenly that peculiar perfume which Alina always used was wafted toward him, and he became dizzy and heart-sick at the memories it evoked. He looked around, to ascertain from what quarter it came, and his eyes met those of the false and cruel woman who had long believed him dead.</p> 
               <p>In that glance he saw that he was recognized, but he coldly turned his eyes away, determined to maintain his incognito at all hazards. A goblet of water was offered to Madame Maretsky, and she recovered sufficiently to go through the ceremony of presentation, but immediately afterward she retired in a tumult of surprise and anger. Before she slept she ascertained that the person who had so deeply moved her was General Ney, with whose reputation she was already familiar. Alina also learned that he was on the eve of marriage with Mademoiselle St. Angeau, a beautiful and wealthy heiress.</p> 
               <p>After all her victim had escaped her! and he had almost achieved the brilliant destiny predicted for him by the old astrologer. Alina felt the certainty in her own mind that this man and Rudolph were one though how he had baffled her, and risen to such a height as to place him beyond her reach, she could not divine. She dared not again strike at the life of one of Napoleon's cherished friends, lest the blow might recoil upon herself; but she could strike him through his betrothed; and she seized a pen, and wrote to M. St. Angeau:</p>

                           <p>"MONSIEUR:-Your daughter is about to bestow her hand upon a man who has a wife yet living. He is not a Frenchman, but an American, who fought in the struggle for freedom in that country, and retired from the army with the rank of Major. His true name is Rudolph, and he is the son of humble though respectable parents. He lived unhappily with his wife; on her account gave up name and country, and came hither as M. Michel, having dropped one letter from his baptismal name to make that soubriquet.</p> 
                           <p>"Show this letter to him, and ask him if he dares deny the truth of the statements I have made.</p>

               <p>Alina took measures to have this missive secretly delivered, at an early hour on the following morning, and then she threw herself upon the couch to snatch a few hours of repose.</p> 
               <p>Years have passed away since we last looked upon her, but she has scarcely changed; the same fair and delicate complexion, the same bewitching grace of manner and softness of expression which could bewilder and allure those she considered worthy of fascinating, were still hers; but her heart was as hard as the diamonds with which she delighted to adorn her person, and the sway which circumstances had given her over others was felt as a bondage of iron. Imperious, stern and haughty to her inferiors, the wife of the Russian magnate ruled as a Princess over the serfs that had become her husband's by inheritance.</p> 
               <p>After years of bitter struggle and poverty, the elder brother suddenly died, and as he had no children, Maretsky became his heir. On the day of Robespierre's downfall he had been wounded and imprisoned; but he was of too little importance to share the fate of the fallen party, and after a few days detention he was released and permitted to leave France.</p> 
                
               <p>Baffled in her attempt to obtain possession of Ida De Vere, his wife accompanied him to Vienna, where she remained with Madame L'Estrange, while Maretsky frequented the most noted resorts for gamblers, and lived upon the spoils he thus gained.</p> 
               <p>Such was the existence they led till the death of the Baron gave his younger brother possession of the family estates and title.</p> 
               <p>Maretsky returned at once to Russia, but Alina soon grew weary of the barbaric splendor with which she was surrounded, and insisted on returning to Paris. The tastes of her husband also led him to prefer a gayer life, and they had now been a week in the city preparing to entertain in the most splendid style. This was her first appearance in public, and the haughty Baroness felt as if Fate had dealt her a cruel blow in presenting to her her hated foe in the hour of her anticipated triumph. She felt as if she could never know repose till she had fathomed the means by which Rudolph had so long led her to believe that he was no longer numbered among the living.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning, M. St. Angeau sat over a late breakfast with his wife and daughter. He smiled upon the latter, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"You looked charmingly last night, my daughter, and I was complimented and congratulated on every side on the brilliant prospects before you. Ah, if those people only knew the romance of this affair, what a talk it would make."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Algae, absently, "but Michel, for I must always call him by that dear name, Michel appeared ill at ease and annoyed when he joined me. He seemed greatly struck by that brilliant Russian Baroness, and made many inquiries about her. Do you know anything of her, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon pre?</foreign> It was asserted that she was a French woman."</p> 
               <pb n="466-467" xml:id="VAC6349-00000226"/> 
               <p>"I believe she is, for I was told that in her youth she was attached to the court of Marie Antoinette. Before the fall of the monarchy she gave her hand to this Baron Maretsky, and, I believe, has lived in Russia since her marriage."</p> 
               <p>"Then Michel could not have known her in other days."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! ha! Agla, I hope you are not jealous already. No-Michel does not know her, I am sure."</p> 
               <p>At that moment a servant entered, bearing a letter on a silver waiter. He presented it to M. St. Angeau, who turned it over and examined the dainty rose-colored envelope in which it was enclosed, before attempting to open it. He laughed as he said:</p> 
               <p>"Madame, this is certainly from a lady, but I hope that you do not share the infirmity of your daughter, who seems ready to torment herself with jealous fears."</p> 
               <p>Madame St. Angeau smiled serenely.</p> 
               <p>"If you do not shew me the contents of you billet, I do not know that I can answer for myself."</p> 
               <p>He broke the seal, glanced over the lines within, and uttered an exclamation of dismay. Agla was aroused from her dreamy reverie, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is it? Why are you so pale and angry, dear father?"</p> 
               <p>His flashing eyes were turned upon her, but tears sprang to them and dimmed their angry glare as he thought of the humiliating revelation which had just been made. Madame St. Angeau snatched the letter, ran her eyes rapidly over its contents, and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! my child, my daughter, what will become of you?"</p> 
               <p>"Good Heavens! what is it? Let me see-let me read for myself."</p> 
               <p>Her father would have withheld the letter, but Agla insisted on seeing it, and as she read she became pale as marble. She summoned courage to say:</p> 
                
               <p>"It is but an anonymous accusation, and deserves little attention. Michel will soon be here, for he promised to call this morning; he can easily defend himself from such a charge as this."</p> 
               <p>The noise of an arrival was at that instant heard, and M. St. Angeau said:</p> 
               <p>"Let us receive him in your boudoir, Madame, for the interview that approaches must be strictly private."</p> 
               <p>He supported the trembling form of his daughter to the apartment indicated, into which Ney was ushered immediately afterward. He looked bright and animated, but the expression of the faces before him chilled him at once. He paused in his advance toward Agla, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has anything happened, that you regard me so strangely?"</p> 
               <p>"A very extraordinary thing has happened, Monsieur," said M. St. Angeau, "which I require you to clear up as becomes a man of honor. Read this letter; it is anonymous, it is true, but if it reveals facts, you dare not deny the assertions of the writer."</p> 
               <p>Ney took the letter, and the sudden paleness that overspread his features was perceptible even beneath the bronzed complexion of the soldier. His hand trembled, and his haughty lips grew tremulous over this last evidence of Alina's undying hatred to himself. He dropped the billet as if it burned his hand, and with a mournful glance at Agla, said:</p> 
               <p>"The writer states facts well known to her, for she was once my wife."</p> 
               <p>Agla uttered a cry and buried her face in the cushions of the sofa on which she had thrown herself. M. St. Angeau, in a voice that trembled with anger, said:</p> 
               <p>"And you-<emph>you</emph> have dared to woo my daughter as your wife. Monsieur, this is--"</p> 
               <pb n="468-469" xml:id="VAC6349-00000227"/> 
               <p>"Stop!" said Ney, in that voice of stern command which could ring like a trumpet tone over the wildest tumult of the battle field-"say nothing which may hereafter demand an apology. Listen to my story, and then judge my conduct. Before Heaven I avow that I have committed no act for which a man should blush in the presence of his betrothed wife. Agla, raise your head, place your hand in mine, and thus shew your confidence in the man you have professed to love."</p> 
               <p>Obedient to his command, the young girl raised herself, and mechanically put forth her cold hand. She endeavored to smile, but the attempt only ended in a hysterical burst of tears. Ney clasped her hand, and held it next his heart, as he said in a voice of deep emotion:</p> 
               <p>"It is a brave and loyal heart, Agla, and it beats only for you; therefore let your own respond to the revelation I am about to make. I have promised you a history of my early life, and I came hither this morning to offer it; for last night I again encountered my evil genius, and I knew that she recognized me. Yet I scarcely expected her hatred to have forestalled me thus. M. St. Angeau, it has never been my purpose to wed your daughter, without first disclosing the facts which that letter reveals; but in the first flush of my happiness, I could not bear to recall that wretched and humiliating record."</p> 
               <p>"Yet if your wife still lives, by what right do you seek another?"</p> 
               <p>"Is there not such a law as divorce? And may not a man fairly consider himself free when his wife has fled from him, and been twice married herself since then? In the land of my birth, an absence of seven years gives back freedom to both parties. More than twice seven have elapsed since she who was my wife deserted me, and I consider myself quite free to form new ties. Is it not so, Agla?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Only prove to me that I have the right to think so," said Agla, feverishly. "I must not-I cannot lose my faith in you, Michel."</p> 
               <p>"Nor shall you, dearest. Listen to the tragic story I came hither to unfold, and grant me the continuation of your love as my consolation for the bitter ordeal through which it has been my lot to pass."</p> 
               <p>Then, with rapid eloquence, Ney related the incidents of his early life; his passionate adoration of Alina, and the return it had met; the vengeance he had taken on Sir Lionel De Vere, and her subsequent attempts to have him assassinated. Nothing was concealed, and at the conclusion of his narrative, M. St. Angeau frankly said:</p> 
               <p>"I am satisfied, Monsieur. You have acted throughout as a man of honor, and my daughter has nothing to complain of; no reasonable bar to your union exists."</p> 
               <p>Agla shuddered; she faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"Ah! does not this woman still live? and has it not been said: 'Whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder?'"</p> 
               <p>"Agla," said her lover, "Alina and I have been long enough separated to give a divorce in any country, and her subsequent conduct has rendered our union null and void. Speak now, for I will not be trifled with: accept my hand, or finally reject it. I have explained everything, and I feel that in honor and good faith I can make you my wife."</p> 
               <p>Thus pressed for a decision which something in the tone of the speaker's voice told her would be final, Agla glanced upward at his noble face, she felt the clasp of his tender hand as it held hers a prisoner against his heart, and she had not the courage to risk losing him. Her head sunk upon his bosom, and she murmured:</p> 
               <p>"Dearest Michel, I am yours. I am satisfied that this bad woman should not have the power to separate us."</p> 
               <pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC6349-00000228"/> 
               <p>"Dear love, your decision is just," said her mother, tenderly kissing her, and the cloud which had gathered so heavily rolled away, leaving the future bright and smiling as before it threatened to burst.</p> 
               <p>Preparations for the marriage went rapidly forward, and to her intense chagrin, Alina heard nothing of the rupture of the engagement. She was preparing to send a second warning, when a reply to her first one came from a most unexpected quarter. An order from Fouch, minister of police, reached her, commanding her to leave Paris within forty-eight hours. While stupefied by this blow, a note, without a signature, was brought to her, which she mechanically read:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"MADAME-You will recognize the hand from which this comes, for it is written to warn you against the repetition of your late attempt to injure one whom fortune has now placed above your reach. Know that the history of your past life as connected with my own, that the infamous attempts you have caused to be made to destroy me, are all written down, and placed in the hands of a friend, who will make them public in case of my sudden death by means not perfectly well understood.</p>
                  <p>"I have baffled your petty malignity by revealing the whole truth to my betrothed, and thus your infamous history is known to others beside myself. I advise you to accept, without delay, the sentence of exile which reached you to-day, as I have reason to know that it will be enforced."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Oh! cruel fate! to be banished from the only city in the world she considered worth living in! and through the influence of a man she believed she had crushed and destroyed. It was too humiliating! but there was no resource but obedience, and to her great surprise, Maretsky submitted to the decree with a degree of equanimity which was unaccountable.</p> 
               <p>He did not tell her that the minister of police had detected his collusion with one of the numerous plots against the life of Napoleon, and contented himself with including him in the banishment pronounced against his wife, without exposing him to further punishment.</p> 
               <p>Baffled, but not subdued, Alina left Paris for Vienna, there to devour her soul with rage in thinking of the happiness of the two she so cordially detested, Rudolph and Helen, and planning new schemes of vengeance against them both.</p> 
               <p>Her son was now eighteen years of age, and she began to think it time to put forward his claims on the inheritance of his father. With that tenacity of purpose which distinguished her, she had never for an instant relinquished the idea of his eventually becoming Sir Lionel De Vere, and she only awaited his coming of age to bring him forward as the legal heir to the baronetcy.</p> 
               <p>The youth was handsome, but effeminate in person, and he possessed none of the mental energy of his mother. He showed but one strong feeling, and that was his attachment to his faithful nurse. Betty was as devoted to him as in his infancy, and she stifled the cry of her conscience when she looked upon his face and thought of the sin she had incurred for his sake.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">GOOD FORTUNE.</head> 
               <p>AGLAE could not consent to give up her lover, but she had many misgivings as to her right to assume the place of<pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC6349-00000229"/> a woman who was still living. Her doubts made her wretched, and she saw the preparations for her marriage go on with a sinking feeling of dread very different from the serene joy with which her heart had lately been filled.</p> 
               <p>Her parents would not listen to the feeble objections she found courage to utter, and her confessor, to whom she applied for advice, took their view of the position in which she was placed. She yearned for a friend on whose judgment she could rely, who would either confirm her doubts or set them at rest forever.</p> 
               <p>Such a one came when she was least expected. While living in Switzerland, M. St. Angeau's family had accidentally made the acquaintance of a sister of charity who, like themselves, had left France to avoid the horrors that were perpetrated there during the Terror. A trifling service led to an intimacy which ripened into a warm friendship.</p> 
               <p>This lady had now for many years resided in England, but she returned twice each year to France to make inquiries concerning a friend to whom all clue had long since been lost.</p> 
               <p>Agla sat in her room pale, languid and depressed, when her maid came in with a joyful face, and announced Sister Therse. The young girl arose and threw herself in the arms of her beloved friend.</p> 
               <p>"Ah!" she exclaimed, "Heaven has sent you to me when I most needed you. Dear Sister, what has brought you hither at this unusual season?"</p> 
               <p>"A haunting presentiment that my presence was needed; that by coming I should solve a mystery which has been the object of my life for years past. If I can be of use to you, dear Agla, I shall feel repaid for my journey, even if I should fail in accomplishing that which brought me hither."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I need you-I need a clear head and a strong heart to counsel me in this crisis of my life. But sit down, take off your hood, and make yourself comfortable before I begin a long story."</p> 
               <p>Sister Therse complied, and while doing so, she surveyed the clouded face of her young friend with deep sympathy. When she was at last established in a large chair in front of the fire, with Agla on a cushion at her feet, she said:</p> 
               <p>"In what can I aid you, Agla? You know that in other days you often made me your conscience-keeper; let me again assume that office, for you look as if something is pressing heavily upon you."</p> 
               <p>"That is precisely what I wish; but this is a much more complicated case than you ever judged before. But first, I must place you in the position of my confessor, and exact from you a pledge of profound silence, for what I am about to reveal is the secret of another, and of vital importance to him."</p> 
               <p>"I give you my word that it shall be as sacred as if revealed in the confessional. You may speak with perfect openness."</p> 
               <p>Thus assured, Agla briefly related the events of the last ten days; but in her own self-absorption she did not heed the emotions that swept over the face of the listener when she spoke of the history of her betrothed. When she repeated the contents of the anonymous letter, Sister Therse suddenly laid her cold hand on that of the speaker, and said:</p> 
               <p>"You speak of Michael Rudolph? he alone can be the hero of this story."</p> 
               <p>"What! you know him! You call the name which has been renounced for many years? How, then, have you learned it, for I have not spoken it."</p> 
               <p>"You are aware that for years I have sought to discover traces of a lost friend; that friend was Michael Rudolph. Under what name is he now known, dear Agla?"</p> 
               <pb n="474-475" xml:id="VAC6349-00000230"/> 
               <p>"My betrothed husband, General Ney, was known to you as Michael Rudolph. His wife yet lives; tell me, I conjure you, if I dare accept his hand while that baleful woman stands as a bar between us."</p> 
               <p>Dora shivered, and for an instant her heart stood still; but she recovered her self-possession, and regarding the earnest, pleading face that was lifted to hers with tender sympathy, she asked:</p> 
               <p>"Agla, do you love this man with all your heart?"</p> 
               <p>"I do-I cannot give him up, though my religious scruples are all against giving him my hand. Oh, Sister Therse, set them at rest if you can; but, above all, tell me what will be right for me to do."</p> 
               <p>Dora quelled the tumult of feeling in her own heart at this unexpected discovery. Her affection for Rudolph was now that of a tender sister, and after a few moments reflection she said:</p> 
               <p>"Alina Derval rent the tie that bound her to Rudolph. She declared it illegal, and gave her hand to Sir Lionel De Vere, though of course no tribunal would acknowledge the validity of the second marriage. She has since been united to her present husband, and I cannot see that Rudolph was wrong in considering himself free to woo you as his wife. Legally he is certainly free; morally, I consider him equally so."</p> 
               <p>Agla listened with eager interest, and she grasped the hand of the speaker and covered it with kisses.</p> 
               <p>"You are my best friend, Sister Therse. I accept your decision, and I will cast these tormenting doubts away, and be happy with him I love so dearly."</p> 
               <p>Sister Therse kissed her tenderly and asked:</p> 
               <p>"When will he be here? Since he is great, honored, and happy, he does not need me; but I yearn to behold him once more. I am his countrywoman: I knew him in his youth; he was a brother to me, and as his sister have I sought him through these long years."</p> 
               <p>"Tell me of my hero; speak to me of those early years in which you knew him;" entreated Agla.</p> 
               <p>Dora related as much of the past as she deemed necessary, and the young girl seemed as if she would never weary of questioning her; but their conversation was interrupted by the announcement of General Ney, and with a bright smile on her lips, and a brilliant flush upon her cheek, Agla left her friend alone while she sought the presence of her lover.</p> 
               <p>Dora had revealed her true name, and Agla had promised to prepare her early friend for the meeting between them. Ney was struck by her joyful air, and he said:</p> 
               <p>"You look bright and happy, my Agla. I have been alarmed at your lassitude and want of life since my unhappy story became known to you; but to-day you seem restored to your true self."</p> 
               <p>"And so I am, thanks to the efforts of one I love and trust. Oh! I am very happy to-day, for I shall restore to you a devoted friend from whom you have long been parted."</p> 
               <p>"Who can it possibly be?" he asked bewildered.</p> 
               <p>"You have heard me speak of Sister Therse; I told you of our meeting in Geneva. She is here; she is a countrywoman of your own, and for years she has sought for some clue to your fate. Now, can you not divine her name?"</p> 
               <p>"There is but one woman on earth who would think me worth seeking after, and that one is Dora Calvert; though how she can be here and under that name I cannot imagine."</p> 
               <p>"It is not more strange than that you should be here under your present name. Yes-Sister Therse is Dora<pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC6349-00000231"/> Calvert, and she comes to be present at our marriage. I leave her to tell you of the years of wandering in search of the friend who is at last found."</p> 
               <p>She opened the door leading into her boudoir, led Dora forward trembling and pale and left them together.</p> 
               <p>"Dora, dear sister."</p> 
               <p>"Michael, my brother," were the words that escaped their lips as they clasped hands and looked into each other's eyes, to read there the tender fraternal affection which united them.</p> 
               <p>Long and earnest was the conversation that ensued. Dora ended it by saying:</p> 
               <p>"The long-sought is found, and I am happy. I believed that you would need me, and I have found it so. I have laid at rest the scruples of a too sensitive conscience, and Agla will be yours. To know that you are prosperous and happy will give joy and peace to my life."</p> 
               <p>"Share that life with us, dear friend. Let our home become yours, and thus enable me to repay the debt of gratitude I owe to both yourself and your father."</p> 
               <p>"I will visit you often," she tranquilly replied; "but my home is with friends I love, and their young people have become very dear to me. Lady De Vere is as a sister to me, and her adopted son is also my protge."</p> 
               <p>Ney would have combatted this decision; but Dora would not be moved from her determination, and she presently unclosed the door of communication and summoned Agla to join them.</p> 
               <p>"Our explanations are ended, and again your lover is all your own," she said with a sweet smile; and the three sat together until the entrance of Madame St. Angeau to welcome her old friend broke up the conversation.</p> 
               <p>On the appointed evening a brilliant wedding took place, to which Sister Therse remained. Among the guests was the First-Consul, with whose subsequent career that of his bravest general is so intimately blended. The predictions of the astrologer were in time fulfilled, for the American backwoodsman became Marshal under the empire, Duke of Elchingen, and finally Prince of Moskwa.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head> 
               <p>WE must return to England, where the last scene in our drama was enacted.</p> 
               <p>It is summer, and the trees around Vere Castle are all in their beauty. A group is gathered on the lawn, consisting of Lady De Vere, her friend, the young Ida, and the adopted child. The daughter of the house has developed into a charming girl; and the little, half-starved waif, that was so strangely picked up in France, has grown into a handsome youth of seventeen summers.</p> 
               <p>There is often in the eyes of Helen a yearning tenderness as she looks on him, and thinks that such as he is her son might have been. Henry is bright, affectionate, and truthful; and he has gained a strong hold on the affection of his friends.</p> 
               <p>The sound of a horse's hoofs is heard approaching, and Sir Reginald, with stern brow and compressed lips, dismounts, and draws near the group. His greeting was so unusual that Lady De Vere apprehensively asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has anything happened to annoy you, Sir Reginald?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," he briefly replied; "I have just received another letter from Madame Maretsky, informing me that she is on the eve of embarking for England to enforce her son's<pb n="478-479" xml:id="VAC6349-00000232"/> rights to the inheritance of his father. Lionel is now of age, and she demands that I shall either bestow upon him the hand of my daughter, or acknowledge him as the heir after my death. I should care very little about so absurd a claim if she were not coming here in person to annoy me."</p> 
               <p>"Alina will not attempt to enter <emph>my</emph> house," said Lady De Vere. "You can meet her in London, and prove to her the futility of this persecution. Our daughter cannot become the wife of her son, nor will the law recognize him as the legal heir."</p> 
               <p>"That is true, but it wounds me to have this old story brought up again, and made the subject of gossip. I should think that Madame Maretsky would shrink from such an expos herself."</p> 
               <p>"Alina shrinks from nothing that can wound or annoy me," said Helen, sorrowfully; and the husband and wife returned together to the house, to confer on what was necessary to be done. The result of their consultation was, that Sir Reginald set out for London on the following morning, and ten days passed away before he again returned.</p> 
               <p>He had heard nothing further from Madame Maretsky, but a terrible storm had occurred during his absence, and many vessels had been wrecked in the channel. Uncertain of her fate, and weary of awaiting her appearance, De Vere left instructions with his lawyers, and returned to the beloved home in which all his happiness was centred.</p> 
               <p>Sister Therse had gone out to take an evening stroll on the day after his arrival; in the park she encountered a wretched, toil-worn woman, who stopped her, and inquired if the family were at the castle.</p> 
               <p>"Yes-Sir Reginald and Lady De Vere are there; have you any business with them?"</p> 
               <p>The woman pressed her hands hysterically upon her throat, and answered almost with a cry:</p> 
                
               <p>"Yes-I have come to tell them what will hang me! but the vengeance of God has overtaken me, and I care for nothing now. My darling-the light of my eyes-is gone, and I do not care to stay behind him."</p> 
               <p>For an instant Sister Therse thought the stranger deranged, but the past flashed upon her mind, and she felt assured that the abductor of the heir was before her. She seized the hand of the woman, fearful that her courage might fail her, and an attempt to escape be made, and hurried with her toward the castle.</p> 
               <p>Betty passively submitted, for she had come hither to make such reparation as now lay in her power, careless of the consequences to herself. Breathless and excited Sister Therse entered the room in which De Vere and his wife sat, who regarded with surprise the wretched figure that accompanied her.</p> 
               <p>This pallid apparition rushed forward, threw herself upon her knees before Sir Reginald, and began to pour forth a torrent of supplications, mingled with lamentations, which for several moments it was impossible to comprehend. But soon a terrible light began to dawn on him: this woman had stolen his child, and the theft would have been concealed to her dying hour, but for the retribution which had overtaken her.</p> 
               <p>He for whose sake the crime had been committed was dead-lost at sea with his mother, and, almost by a miracle, the wretched nurse had been saved. She believed that God had granted her a few more days of life, that such atonement as was now possible to her might be made. She had begged her way to the castle to relieve her conscience of its heavy burden before death claimed her as its own.</p> 
               <p>Betty at length paused, and De Vere asked in faltering tones:</p> 
               <p>"Where then is my son? What have you done with him through all these long years?"</p> 
               <pb n="480-481" xml:id="VAC6349-00000233"/> 
               <p>"I took the baby to France and placed him with a woman in the country to be nursed. When he was a year old I put him in the basket that receives foundlings at one of the charitable institutions in Paris. Since then I know nothing of him. I left France with my lady, and in the days of the Terror the children were all set adrift. Oh, sir! I know that you can never forgive me, but I am dying, and I felt as if I must come and tell you this before I go."</p> 
               <p>"And is there no clue by which we can trace our child?" asked the pallid mother.</p> 
               <p>"I put a mark on him, Madam. I pricked three letters on his left shoulder and rubbed gunpowder in them. By that token I hoped to know him again."</p> 
               <p>"And those letters-what were they?" was the breathless inquiry of De Vere.</p> 
               <p>"S. F. E., with the date of the year on which he was taken away. The letters stand for stolen from England, for I was afraid to put the initials of his own name upon him, lest they might lead to discovery.</p> 
               <p>Lady De Vere arose, threw herself in her husband's arms, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Was it not a voice from Heaven that told me to claim him? My own-my <emph>own</emph> boy! Oh, sister Therse, bring him hither, that I may clasp him to my heart as my recovered treasure."</p> 
               <p>In a few moments the youth entered, looking surprised and bewildered at the scene that met his eyes, and those feelings were increased by the rapidity with which Sir Reginald laid bare his shoulder and commanded the stranger to look upon it. Betty glanced at the mark, and clasping her hands, said:</p> 
               <p>"The ways of God are wonderful! This is your son, sir. That is the mark I put upon him, but how he came here I cannot understand."</p> 
                
               <p>"That shall be explained, and since he <emph>is</emph> here, I forgive you for the crime you committed; for the years of wretchedness you have given me. A few more days and your earthly account will be rendered; God forbid that I should attempt to punish one whom He has already dealt with."</p> 
               <p>Exhausted by her efforts to reach the castle, Betty was indeed in a dying condition; but she lived long enough to give a detailed account before a magistrate of everything connected with the abduction of the heir. His identity thus established, he was acknowledged amid great rejoicings.</p> 
               <p>The Life-Curse was removed, and the two families she had persecuted enjoyed peace and happiness.</p>

               <p>Many who have the taste, and wish to form a Library, are deterred by fear of the cost. To all such we would say, that a large number of books may be furnished for even One Hundred Dollars-which, by a yearly increase of a small amount, will before long place the purchaser in possession of a Library in almost every branch of knowledge, and afford satisfaction not only to the collector, but to all those who are so fortunate as to possess his acquaintance.</p> 
               <p>For the convenience of Book buyers, and those seeking suitable Works for Presentation, great care is taken in having a large and varied collection, and all the current works of the day. Show counters and shelves, with an excellent selection of Standard, Illustrated, and Illuminated works, varying in price to suit all buyers, are available to those visiting our establishment, where purchases may be made with facility, and the time of the visitor greatly economized. Here may be seen not only books of the simplest kind for children, but also exquisite works of art, of the most sumptuous character, suitable alike to adorn the drawing-room table and the study of the connoisseur.</p>
