The horde of cuticular blemishes—such for instance as TAN, FRECKLES, PIMPLES, SALLOWNESS, SUNBURN, PUSTULES, RASHES, ERYSIPELAS, MORPHEW, MOTH, TETTER, SALTRHEUM, RINGWORM, REDNESS and ROUGHNESS, depart from before this wonderful Soap, as the rank night dews are dispersed by the morning sun. Its soothing and healing qualities make it peculiarly valuable to the tender skins of infants; and for the purposes of shaving and bathing, (either in hard or soft water,) it is just the article wanted. GOURAUD'S POUDRE SUBTILE is the only depilatory extant which will up-root superfluous hair, without injury to the most delicate skin, GOURAUD'S HAIR RESTORATIVE will make wiry hair silky and glossy, force hair to grow where it has fallen off, and prevent hair from turning prematurely gray. GOURAUD'S LIQUID ROUGE is a beautiful article for staining pale cheeks and lips a delicate rose color.</p>
            <p>GOURAUD'S LILY WHITE is the only article ladies should use for whitening the complexion.

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>"HUSH—hush!—The child is sleeping. God's blessing on its gentle slumbers. Will it dream of fairy kisses and rich banquets? Will busy gorgeous fancy paint to that pure spirit, a garden of the imagination, full of sweets? Hush, Clara, hush! our little one sleeps. Those fringed portals have closed upon the world, and all its sorrows. Those laughing orbs, that seem to have stolen their azure beauty from heaven itself, are hidden. Our child sleeps, Clara, though we are desolate? Hush, what is that?"</p>
               <p>"The wind and the rain. Oh, Herbert, shall we ever know joy again? I am chilled to the heart. Herbert—Herbert, speak to me of hope, and I will live upon the sunshine of your words."</p>
               <p>Herbert Sinclair, to whom these words were uttered, in a soft, gentle voice, by her whom he had charmed by the eloquence of love from home and kindred, to be his, was for some moments incapable of framing a reply which should not be a reflex of the despair which was slowly, but surely, like some dreadful spectre, creeping over his own heart. He wished to breathe words of hope and consolation, while all his perceptions combined to bid him despair. By the dim and uncertain light of a miserable candle, he glanced around him at his wretched home. Home! When did so magical and heart-cheering, gentle a word translate itself into so much desolation?</p>
               <p>The house in which they resided was one of those large, partially dilapidated buildings that abound in Elizabeth street.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8050-00000004"/>
               <p>Its numerous tenants spoke in as various tongues as confounded the builders of Babel. Representatives for a Congress of all nations, might have been found without leaving the building. Irish and Germans, Sweeds and Italians were clustered together as thickly as bees in a hive—but without the order and regularity of the little honey-makers.</p>
               <p>The busy hum of mechanical employments filled the air of the first floor and the long rambling wilderness of rooms below. Above those regions of industry there were people who struggled to live, and in some way did live; while the attics were the abodes of wretchedness and gaunt poverty.</p>
               <p>One would have thought, in such a little city of itself as this house presented, there would have been mutual dependence and mutual assistance, that some warm heart from below would ascend the gloomy staircase to inquire if there were happiness or woe far above: but no. Even death, at times, claimed its victims, and it was only by the passage out of the melancholy receptacle of poor humanity, that those below knew that some weary spirit was at rest. All was cold selfishness. Each individual seemed wrapped up in contemplation of his own actual or possible wants. There was no room in any heart for the holy feeling of human brotherhood. The struggle to live—the fight for existence amidst the dense throngs of such a city as this, had smothered all gentle sensibilities. To each, each seemed a foe, and even the common courtesies of life were submerged in the conflict to exist.</p>
               <p>And thus it was that Herbert and his young wife, Clara—he who had seen much of the sunny side of existence, and she who had been the petted child of fortune—were left to starve, surrounded by nearly half a million human hearts, and countless treasures.</p>
               <p>A combination of circumstances had left them, two years after their union, friendless and destitute. There was but one person akin to them who could have mended their condition, and she "never encouraged imprudent marriages."</p>
               <p>Herbert had education and talent. He clung to both as a drowning mariner clings to some drift of ocean weeds he thinks may save him. Alas, poor Herbert! he, too soon, found that he was outstripped in the race of existence, by those whose only qualifications were assurance, and some accident of position.</p>
               <p>Clara had jewels—small cherished trinkets—mementoes of affection she thought a world's wealth would never purchase from her. They were still clung to in poverty; but actual want knows no romance or sensibilities; and all that she cherished as her girlish property, vanished. It is night when we peep with the reader into the most miserable attic of that gaunt, cold house—rain, wind, and dashing sleet are without—desolation is within.</p>
               <p>"Herbert—Herbert, you do not speak to me. Herbert!"</p>
               <p>"I was thinking, Clara—thinking of all that we had suffered. Oh! Clara, do you not sometimes hate me when you tell yourself that it was I who weaned you from your home, and made you what you are?"</p>
               <p>For a few moments she was silent; but what a world of eloquence was in the look with which she regarded Herbert! Then she flung herself upon his breast, and a gush of tears came to her relief. She thought, but she could not say so, that until then an unkind word had never come from his lips.</p>
               <p>How sacred and solemn the deep sobs of that fair young creature sounded in that wretched room! and he, too—the husband who had so fondly dreamt of such a long period of happiness, when he had made her, who was the loadstone of his faith in all that was good and beautiful, his own—he could not speak now; and the stillness had a charm about it that neither wished to break.</p>
               <p>Then by the dim uncertain light he parted the fair hair across that brow of snow, and in half chocked accents he spoke—</p>
               <p>"When—when, Clara, had you—food?"</p>
               <p>She smiled faintly, as she rested her hands upon his breast.</p>
               <p>"I have done well, Herbert, so well; and—and I have a supper for you. Hush! hush! do not awaken Henry. I shall want nothing but the joy of seeing you, Herbert. You know my heart?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! well I know it."</p>
               <p>"You mistake me, dear. I mean the little cornelian heart, which—which—you know—"</p>
               <p>"You prized so much."</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay, I had had it long and was tired of it. Look yonder, do you not see something? It is food, Herbert. They gave me some food for it, and—I have had some, and so has Henry. It is all for you. You do not smile Herbert. Herbert, speak to me. Herbert, my Herbert!"</p>
               <p>He stood with clasped and trembling hands, looking in her pale, wan face, where famine had set up its fading banner. He saw all the affectionate deceit that would make him think that his wants only waited to be supplied. He knew how the little trinket had been prized—how hard must have been the struggle to bid it adieu. He staggered back to a seat. He sunk upon it, and, for the first time in all their sadness, the scalding drops of anguish gushed from his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Herbert—my Herbert! Oh, God! No—no. Anything, Herbert, but this. Help, help: Herbert, speak to me—speak to me. Is there a Heaven above us? It is your own Clara who calls upon you. Do you love me, Herbert?—do you love me still? 'Tis I, Clara, your own girl, Clara, who now kisses your hands. Herbert you will break my heart. I am kneeling at your feet. My child Henry—Henry—rise with a strength bestowed by God, and stretch forth your arms to save me from madness. Herbert, only a word—speak to me but one word, to tell me that you know me."</p>
               <p>The attic-door opened, and a man presented himself at the small aperture. Clara saw him; but in the position that Herbert occupied, his back was to the intruder; and, indeed, he was in that state of mental excitement that he did not notice the alarm of Clara. That, independently of any other consideration than the mere aspect of the new arrival, such an alarm was justifiable, might be proved by one glance at the stranger.</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8050-00000005"/>
               <p>He was a man past the middle of life. His dress was abject as his manner, and upon his countenance there sat so fixed an expression of fright, that it was quite contagious to look upon.</p>
               <p>"Shelter—shelter," he said. "You would not let an old man be dragged to the scaffold!; Oh! no!—no! Grant me shelter for a moment! Hide me! Hide me! Hark! That's his footstep—keep off—I did not do it. 'Twas he—she—any one but me!"</p>
               <p>Herbert had sprung to his feet at the first sound of the strange voice, and with fearful traces of the deep emotion that had swept across his heart still visible upon his face, he gazed upon the singular being, who still stood trembling upon the threshold of the room.</p>
               <p>"Don't betray me!—oh, don't betray me!" said the stranger. "You may have heard and read legends of the wild and wonderful, of how man has hunted from their forest lairs the savage denizens of the forest; but you never yet heard of men hunting man as I have been hunted. Oh, no!—no! Oh, God, no! Keep back—back! Slow—slow!—slow!"</p>
               <p>He crept from the doorway into the room, while Clara clung to Herbert in dismay, and the latter was too much astonished at the singular character of the intrusion to speak. The strange man went towards the window of the attic, and in his progress he had to pass the little cot where slept the dearest hope of Clara—her beautiful boy. All terror, all surprise, was overcome in the mother's fears for the safety of her little one, and with a cry of anguish Clara sprung forward, and clasped the child in her arms. The intruder took fresh alarm; and dashing open the window, was upon the parapet of the house in a moment.</p>
               <p>A cold gush of night air, loaded with rain and sleet, dashed into the room. The light was in a moment extinguished, and the hoarse wind careered with violence through the precincts of the humble home. The child shrieked in sympathy with Clara's cry of alarm, and clung vehemently to her for protection against it knew not what; and Herbert, now fully awakened from the state of inaction into which he had been at first thrown, by the suddenness of the whole affair, sprang to the window to lay hands upon the stranger.</p>
               <p>The darkness was most intense, and battling as he was with the cold dashing shower that came in at the window, Herbert in vain tried to clutch the shivering wretch, who now, with faint moans, crouched within an inch of destruction.</p>
               <p>"A light, Clara—a light!" he cried. "This is some poor maniac. A light for the love of mercy!"</p>
               <p>A strange gleam of light shot across the ceiling of the room. It played for an instant upon the face and clothing of Herbert, and then, in a concentrated ray, it fell upon the man who crouched on the giddy verge of the house top. The trembling wretch rose up, and with one appalling, cry upon his lips, he flung himself backwards over the parapet.</p>
               <p>The storm of wind and rain seemed for a moment to be hushed; and then, with a wailing sound, it came again, as if sighing the requiem of him who lay a shattered, mangled mass below.</p>
               <p>"God! he has gone at last!" cried a voice; and a man rushed to the window to endeavor to catch a glimpse into the profound depths below. "Bones, Bones, run down to the street, and see if life lingers in him. It will be a great mercy to find him dead. Do you hear me. Bones?"</p>
               <p>"Reether," said a policeman, who stood in the doorway, and the light from whose lantern had produced the concentrated ray which had fallen upon the maniac.</p>
               <p>In another moment all was dark again, for Clara, in her agitation, was quite incapable of procuring a light, although match after match was ignited, and for a fleeting instant cast its spectral glare upon the miserable apartment and the few objects it contained. Herbert now spoke.</p>
               <p>"What in the name of Heaven," he said, "is the meaning of all this? A stranger is now present. Let him declare his errand here, or the darkness may not protect him."</p>
               <p>"Be under no apprehension," said a manly, and yet gentle voice.</p>
               <p>"There's no danger. If you can procure a light, I will explain to you the meaning of what has occurred."</p>
               <p>It was strange, but to Herbert's ears there was a something about the tones of the speaker that rung upon his ears like some half-forgotten tune to which he could give no name, and yet which memory told him had at one time held a distinct place in his brain. Without making any reply, he groped his way as well as he could to the chimney piece, where he knew he should find the means of procuring a light, and where, indeed, the trembling Clara already was making vain efforts to illumine the room.</p>
               <p>Herbert was more successful. The wretched candle was again ignited; and holding his hand partially around it as a shield, he looked anxiously towards the stranger.</p>
               <p>The first sight was that of a well-dressed man, with his hat off, and who, with a slight but graceful bow, said—</p>
               <p>"I have sincerely to apologize for the aparently rude manner of my entrance here, and I hope that when I explain—"</p>
               <p>The candle dropped from the hands of Herbert, as he exclaimed—"</p>
               <p>"Is that Charles Horton, or his apparition? Speak—speak!"</p>
               <p>"You know me!" said the stranger. "Your voice, too, is familiar. Surely you are not——"</p>
               <p>"Herbert Sinclair!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. Good Heaven! this is indeed a surprise. My dear Herbert—my old, much loved schoolfellow and friend."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Charles! for you to find me thus!" sighed Herbert, as he made an ineffectual effort in the dark to shake hands with his old companion. "A light, Clara—a light! There is no danger now."</p>
               <p>Charles Horton finding that the draught of air from the window was the great obstacle to throwing a light upon the scene, succeeded in closing the little casement, and so shutting out the storm that still raved without, and had sent such dashing indications of its presence into the apartment. Another minute, and the small uncertain flame<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8050-00000006"/> of the wretched candle lent its sickly light to the wretched attic. Herbert stood irresolute, as if he thought that one glance around that destitute home would be sufficient to chill the warm heart of friendship; but he did an injustice to the feelings of him who had frolicked with him in boyhood's happy days, and he found his hand soon clasped in both those of Charles Horton.</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear fellow," cried Charles, "how I have sought you, and all in vain, in this great city. This is a happy meeting, indeed. Why you are really not much altered, and how it was that I did not in a moment name you when I heard your voice, is the most remarkable thing in the world. But pray excuse me for my breach of politeness, madam, "turning to Clara. "I should first ask for the pleasure of being introduced to you. Your lady, I presume, Herbert?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Charles. Clara, this is my old school friend, whom I thought never to see again."</p>
               <p>Clara acknowledged in her own quiet and gentle manner—that manner that always had with it an ineffable charm that words cannot convey—the introduction; and then it was quite evident that Charles sought to put his old friend as much at his case as possible regarding any effect which the wretched appointments of his home might have produced, for he spoke rapidly:</p>
               <p>"I do hope, Herbert, we shall see much of each other now; I hope you have leisure to be my constant companion. I really have several times had serious thoughts of advertising for you."</p>
               <p>"Charles, look at this place," said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes—you prefer being out of the bustle that living nearer the streets entails upon you."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, Charles; I know what you mean. It is kind and generous, and like yourself, to try to pass off as nothing the state in which you find me; but I know your heart bleeds to see it, Charles. Let us have between us no flimsy web of deception. I am with those whom I love, destitute and——"</p>
               <p>"Dead as a nut!" said Bones, the Policeman, thrusting his head into the attic through a small crevice-like opening of the door.</p>
               <p>"Take the necessary steps," said Charles Horton. "You know where to find me."</p>
               <p>"Reether."</p>
               <p>Bones drew out his his head again, and went lumbering down the attic-stairs. Charles then rose, and in a low voice, which shook a little, he said—</p>
               <p>"Excuse me for ten minutes, Herbert."</p>
               <p>In another moment he, too, was gone.</p>
               <p>Clara had listened to the brief conversation that had taken place between her husband and his old friend with painful interest. She would have wished that Herbert had not been so sincere in his revelation of their wretched state; and now that they were alone again, she leant her head upon her hands and wept.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">MORNING.</head>
               <p>HERBERT rose and gently approached her who had been the partner of his dearest joys and greatest sorrows. With a slight violence—a violence that had no force of roughness in it—he removed her hands from before that face which had been his dream of all that was beautiful. The tears were upon the long silken lashes of those eyes which to him were as twin stars from heaven.</p>
               <p>"Clara," he said, "my Clara. Listen to me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Herbert—yes."</p>
               <p>"You and I could suffer calmly and uncomplainingly. We could endure not only poverty, but even the contumely of those who will have it that want is sin, and that a state of destitution must likewise be a state of deprivation of all pure feeling or nobility of soul. You think that I have forgotten the proper pride even of such a state as ours by speaking as I have spoken to my old schoolfellow, but—but, Clara, there is one argument that makes me humble."</p>
               <p>Clara looked tearfully and inquiringly in her husband's face.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he added, in a faltering voice, "there is one thing that beats down all my pride—that wars successfully against all the stern resistance that a haughty spirit might make against the world and its afflictions."</p>
               <p>"What—what, Herbert?"</p>
               <p>"Hush—hush! We—we destroy by these tears our faculty of showing a bold front to misfortune. Hush! I hear a footstep—some one comes. Be calm, my Clara. Who knows but happy days—ay, happier than we have ever known—may yet be coming."</p>
               <p>"Not happier, Herbert—oh, not happier. Do you recollect the garden, far, far, away, where first you told me that you loved me?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes. The dear garden. The sunshine came showering through the clustering vine leaves, dappling our path with light and shade."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Herbert—my color went and came like the brief sunlight of an April day. We could see the house, too, through the trees."</p>
               <p>"And its bay-window where I sometimes held you to my heart."</p>
               <p>"Yes; the trellis-walk, too—the sweet flowers. Oh, Herbert, we have been happy."</p>
               <p>A smile—such a smile as for many a day had not lit up with its radiant beauty the sweet face of Clara—now beamed upon it; closer—closer still she nestled to her husband's heart. Anxiety, pain, poverty and woe, all were forgotten in that happy moment as busy fancy painted the blissful past. The door of the attic opened, and Clara darted from her husband's arms with a cry of alarm. She had forgotten all the world beside. It was Mr. Horton who had returned, and by his flushed countenance and hard breathing, he showed that he had made good speed to redeem his promise of returning quickly.</p>
               <p>"Well, Herbert, "he said, "you shall tell me at another time of your varying fortunes; and as I dare say you are anxious to know the<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8050-00000007"/> meaning of the dreadful catastrophe that has occurred connected with the man who threw himself from your window, I may tell you that he was a maniac who had been for more than thirty years confined in a lunatic asylum, and by one of the most singular chances in the world contrived to effect his escape. It was not my particular business to do so, but I got upon his track and assisted the force. Come, let us make ourselves as comfortable as we can. Oh, you are there, Bones, are you?"</p>
               <p>"Reether!" said Bones, as he marched into the room with a bundle of wood in his hand. "Reether! Now, young fellow, just shoot 'em down close to the grate, and then they'll be handy."</p>
               <p>These last words were addressed to a boy who made his appearance with a bushel of coals upon his backs, and, as directed, he shot them down in a corner by the desolate-looking fire-place.</p>
               <p>"Now," said Bones, "move on."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said the boy. "I only wishes as people who lives up four pair o' stairs would do without coals, that's all."</p>
               <p>"Do you?" said Bones. "Now move."</p>
               <p>"Very good," said the boy, moving towards the door.</p>
               <p>The policeman then proceeded without any further remark, and to the intense surprise of Clara and Herbert, to light a fire in the cold and desolate grate; and it was quite a subject worthy of contemplation to behold the worthy policeman so occupied. He occasionally, too, as great minds are rather prone to fits of abstraction, gave utterance to his inward cogitations as he proceeded in his extra duty.</p>
               <p>"Bless this here grate," said Bones. "It's as cold as yer old frind when yer axes him for the loan of a trifle."</p>
               <p>"Murder! That comes of talking while yer lighting a fire. I've almost scorched my thumb off. I think it will light up now, Mum; if it doesn't, you'd better git down afore it, and give it a blow; no offence, Mum; but attic fires hasn't the best kind of flues, and I should say, this, Mum, was a rum 'un."</p>
               <p>"That will do," said Charles. "You can go, now!"</p>
               <p>The policeman left the room.</p>
               <p>"This is cheering," said Herbert, as the fire-light flickered and danced upon the walls of the old attic. "It is long since so ruddy a glow fell upon the place. I—I wish, Charles, that we could make you welcome to something more than the warmth you've yourself brought us."</p>
               <p>"Don't mention it," said Charles, as he cast an anxious eye towards the door of the attic. "It's not of the least consequence in the world, my dear fellow. Allow me——"</p>
               <p>Some one tapped at the attic door; and Charles made such good speed to answer the summons for admission, that he outstripped Herbert and Clara, who, hearing the sound, were both upon the move. He flung the door open, and when he saw who was there, he cried,—</p>
               <p>"All right! Come in."</p>
               <p>Upon this, two men, having the appearance of hotel waiters, presented themselves, having, each of them, a large tray, upon which knives, forks, glasses and bottles, made such a pleasant musical jingle, that it was quite delightful to hear it.</p>
               <p>"Is this here the hattic?" said one of the men holding up his head, until his nose seemed desirous of catching something expected to fall from the roof. "Is this here the hattic? Who's to be sponsible for the silver spoons?"</p>
               <p>Charles Horton walked up to him and looked him steadily in the face, until the craven spirit of the man, who saw fit to sneer at poverty, succumbed; and he looked down and began to stammer out excuses. Charles disdained to speak, but he silently pointed to a wretched little table that was in the centre of the room. The waiters—for waiters they were from an adjoining hotel—understood him, and in a few moments there was laid before the astonished and fascinated gaze of Herbert and Clara, such an array of good cheer as they might have seen in dreams, for the wretched are said often to dream of gorgeous banquets, but which they certainly had no idea of ever, in reality, be holding in that squalid abode of want.</p>
               <p>Charles pointed to the door, and the two waiters disappeared. He turned to Clara, and with a half bow, he said—</p>
               <p>"Madam, will you invite me to supper? If I were not so old a friend of your much respected husband, I should not prefer such a request"</p>
               <p>Clara could not speak, but she ran to the cot in which the child lay sleeping and hid her tears in pretended attention to the little one.</p>
               <p>"This is like you, Charles," said Herbert. "You are still the generous, romantic—but no matter. I—I cannot thank you."</p>
               <p>"Then you cannot distress me," said Charles.</p>
               <p>Clara sat with little Henry in her arms. The bright fire crackled, blustered and blazed. The sparkling wine hissed and made its mimic commotion in the long graceful glasses. Herbert smiled—Clara looked something as she was wont to look, and little Henry, with his cheeks curiously distended by pastry, screamed with delight.</p>
               <p>Never was there such a supper so enjoyed—never did there meet four people—yes, we will count Henry—with so much real good feeling towards each other, and who, with so, keen a relish, enjoyed each other's society, as upon that memorable occasion. The clouds and vapors of an evil destiny seemed to have been dashed aside for ever from the heaven of Herbert's happiness. He was no longer the cynic who could find no sympathy, or gentleness of heart, in human nature. Want, and cold, and desolation, were at arm's length now, and jocund smiles, and merry peals of happy laughter, played about the room, like spirits come to bless the cheer that sparkled on the board.</p>
               <p>"Charles," said Herbert, as he raised a brimming glass, and at the thought of what he was about to say the tears started to his eyes,</p>
               <p> "Charles, God bless you, and may you——" His eyes were directed towards the door of the attic, and he paused. All now looked in that direction, and to their surprise, they beheld a curious throng of faces at the entrance—a pyramid of glaring eyes, commencing at its base by those of little children, and terminating at its apex by the large<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8050-00000008"/> famished-looking orbs of a tall, gaunt man, who lived—no, who starved—in one of the adjoining attics.</p>
               <p>"God bless me!" said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"We have had enough," said Clara.</p>
               <p>"Yes," cried Charles. "All but this bottle, and our present glasses, ladies and gentlemen, will you oblige me by removing to your several apartments?"—the hungry throng began to glide away—"by removing to your several apartments,"added Charles, in a louder voice, "what you see upon this table; and at your leisure, bring back the dishes and etceteras."</p>
               <p>Oh, what a rush was there! Young and old of the famished crowd sprang into the garret, and as if by some miraculous means, the table was cleared in a trice, and the room again left to the quiet possession of Herbert, his family, and Charles Horton.</p>
               <p>"I ought to have thought of them," said Clara. "Oh, Mr. Horton, you can have no idea of what scenes of many colored life have come to our knowledge since we have been in this place."</p>
               <p>"I can imagine some of it, Madam."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Charles," said Herbert, with a sigh, "you may, as a man of the world, imagine much; but if you have not felt what we have felt, you can know but little of the dread reality."</p>
               <p>"Let us speak of happier themes, Herbert. Can we find nothing, my old friend, to interest us, but miseries? May I use the great freedom of expressing my surprise to find you thus low?"</p>
               <p>"You may. The answer I cannot give you, except that it is so, Charles?"</p>
               <p>"But surely, in Philadelphia, there are so many ways and means of living, that a clever man, young, active, with good address and education need hardly want."</p>
               <p>"I have often heard that kind of speech made, Charles, and yet here I am, as you see me, and here are those whom I love, as you see them. I tell you, Charles, that there is no danger, there is no peril, no toil that I would not undergo to better the condition of Clara and our child; but Providence seems to have made us a waif and stray, as it were upon the surface of society, and I am what I am. My life is aimless. I have no pursuit. I can do nothing. And yet, as you say, I have certain advantages that look as though they were vendable in the great market of human industry."</p>
               <p>"You are excited, Herbert. We will talk of this another time, I fear that I must leave you know. Hark, some clock strikes. Ah, it is twelve."</p>
               <p>Charles, as he spoke, glanced at a watch of brilliant appearance that he slightly drew from his vest pocket.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Herbert, with a wild sort of laugh. "We have one advantage of living so high in the world. We are near enough to the church steeples to hear the hour go well. But must you go, Charles?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I must. Is it asking too much of you to go a little way? Or shall I be displeasing Mrs. Sinclair by making the request?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, no," said Clara. "I am so glad. Herbert goes out so little, that I am quite happy to get him to take a turn in the street; and besides, this is his hour, Mr. Horton."</p>
               <p>"His hour?"</p>
               <p>"Yes." said Herbert. This is my hour. At midnight only can I venture to sally forth and tread the broad streets of this gay city. Then I do not meet faces that I hate to look upon with all their cold, calculating cunning. Then only, am I not jostled by the gilded fools of fortune that saunter along Chestnut street. Then through long marble-lined streets, which in the day are thick with crawling, cringing humanity as the sunbeams are with bright atoms I can pace my silent way, and ponder upon many things. Then there is no curious eye full of the vanity of fashion to notice, with a sneer of self-gratification, how faded is the poor gentleman who passes on his shivering way. The chariot wheels of the smiling bedizened sons and daughters of Mammon, do not bespatter me at such an hour; and doubly welcome is it to me when the rain deluges the great city, and when the blustering winds play rough music about its house-tops. Yes, midnight is my hour."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Herbert," said Clara, as she took his hand in hers. "You will not, you really must not, go forth to-night; your hands are hot, your eyes have in them an unnatural light. You are not yourself, Herbert, Mr. Horton will for this time excuse you. You must not go from home."</p>
               <p>"Home—home?"</p>
               <p>He held his hand over his eyes for a few moments, and then in a calmer tone he said—</p>
               <p>"Clara, you are right. I was speaking under excitement; but that has passed away: now I am myself again—indeed, I am; and as a good proof that I am so, I will tell you with a smile that the bright wine our friend made us so gay with, is so rare a guest now in my brain, that it played for a moment or two some havoc with my imagination. But all that has passed away now. You see I am quite calm and collected now, Clara. Do you not think so?"</p>
               <p>"I will hope so, Herbert. That smile was like one of your old ones. I think you may go in safety now."</p>
               <p>"Be assured I may. Farewell. I will not exceed my usual time, Clara."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Herbert ran to the cot, and kissed his child. He held Clara for one moment to his heart, and then, turning to Horton, he said, in a clear voice that rang like a bell through the old attic—</p>
               <p>A mid all trials—all privations—all wants, miseries, and horror, Charles, I have preserved one priceless jewel which we never thought for one moment of bartering even for our lives—one gem that, by its radiance, consoled us even for the pangs of hunger, and made a summer of the dreariest winter, that even in its howling fury dared rattle at our casement."</p>
               <p>"Indeed?" said Charles Horton. "A gem—a jewel—of priceless worth, say you?"</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8050-00000009"/>
               <p>"Ay, of priceless value. It is an honest heart—an unseared conscience. Charles, I have only suffered misery and injustice—I have inflicted none!"</p>
               <p>Charles Horton turned completly round, so that for a moment, his face was hidden in shadow. It was only for a moment, however; and then with quite a light and airy smile, he again faced his old companion, as he said—</p>
               <p>"Why, that is well. Indeed, Herbert, you do right to talk of such a possession as a priceless jewel. It is one which Kings might well envy you the keeping of; and that you may always wear it in your heart of hearts is the first wish of your old friend. Come, Herbert, come. I will not keep him long from you, Madam; but if the stay from his home should be rather protracted, recollected that he is with me, and that this is a meeting after a separation of years. We may, perchance, lose a little count of time, as the recollections of the past crowd upon us."</p>
               <p>"Tis natural," said Clara.</p>
               <p>Herbert waived his hand, and smiling upon his wife and child, left the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>They never saw him again smile as he then smiled!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Be careful of the old stairs, Charles," said Herbert as they descended. "Follow me. You will find a balustrade to your right all the way down. Cling to it, and you will do well. This is, indeed, a sad place for you to come to."</p>
               <p>"Not at all—not at all. I like shadows in pictures; of late, to tell the truth, Herbert, I have been rather sickened by too much glitter. But here we are in the street at last; and see—the rain has passed away, and a bright star or two is peeping over the house-tops. What a delicious freshness there is in this breeze!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Charles, as I told you, this is my home. But now my friend, let's think. You do not dread remark by taking the arm of one so low on fortune's wheel as I am? Well—well; no one sees us, and I am not quite certain that ill fortune is positively contagious. But what was I saying? Oh, I was about to remark that I always thought your fortunes were all for the seeking, Charles.</p>
               <p>"And so might be found."</p>
               <p>"You have found fortune, then? Now, of a truth, I am very glad, indeed, that the slippery jade has not played you false as well as me. You are rich, Charles. But how did you propitiate the blind Goddess?"</p>
               <p>"By trusting her."</p>
               <p>"Trusting her? Trusting her? That is a riddle. I do not understand you, Charles."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps when you do understand me you will feel inclined to quarrel with the explanation."</p>
               <p>"Now, Charles, you are more mysterious than before."</p>
               <p>"Well, you shall be enlightened, for I do not know then but that to your perception I may hold your arm under false pretences. You must know then, Herbert Sinclair, that in this huge city there are men, who from their cradles have been the spoilt favorites of liberal fortune—men, who hardly ever knew what it was to have the wildest wish ungratified. Can you believe that there are such men?"</p>
               <p>"I can."</p>
               <p>"Then you may perhaps have heard that there is one pleasure, one excitement, that never fails them, although it is so allied to destruction, that never fails them, although it is so allied to destruction, that a cold looker-on upon the world's excitements would scarcely fancy human nature could be in love with such an unmasked horror. You have heard that there are gaming tables in Philadelphia?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! that is, indeed, a shining horror—an unmasked wretchedness! But you had no fortune to squander in such a way. You had no ennui to dispel by such a dubious process, Charles."</p>
               <p>"I had not; but I had hopes and aspirations. I had tastes and wants; and so, as I say, I trusted fortune, and she has been kind enough to make me the recipient of some of the profuse wealth of those whom I have mentioned to you."</p>
               <p>"In other words, then," said Herbert hesitatingly, as he walked slower, "you are——a——"</p>
               <p>"Out with it, man; it is a bold, bad word. Out with it! I am a gambler!"</p>
               <p>There was silence among the old playmates for some few seconds, and then Charles spoke rapidly. "You shrink from this candid avowal of my mode of life, Herbert. But when you come to think you will perhaps find that although the choice is not one which either you or I would make, were other paths fairly opened to our view; yet, there may be extenuations; as for example—those who will gamble, come willingly to the tables. I find them there; I do not carry them there; and then, again, their gold might get into worse hands, as to its future uses, than those of your old friend. I am like one who picks up jewels that the careless and the improvident 'cast from them. It is true, I have to stoop to do it somewhat lower than I like; but that is all."</p>
               <p>"A gambler?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a gambler! <emph>a blackleg!</emph> Now, Herbert, do we still know each other, or do we part for ever? I would not keep your company and let you think me other than what I am. Make your choice. We have met, and we may be warm friends; but cast me off, if you will. I have chosen my path in life, and will abide by it. What say you?"</p>
               <p>"Charles, I will not be such a moral coward as to be frightened by such a word. We are old friends still!"</p>
               <p>They both shook hands in the street, and then in a low, comforting tone, Charles added,—</p>
               <p>"You shall come with me to-night, Herbert, and see how this sort of thing is done. Who knows but that from this time there may arise a new era in your life? If fools will scatter gold to the winds, and if happy chance should send the gale that carries the treasure to your hands, will you not clutch at it? Ha! Ha! of course, you will. Come, my friend—Come. I will show you a new life to-night!"</p>
               <p>"To-night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to-night. Do you know that in Philadelphia a new life begins<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8050-00000010"/> gins at this hour? Do you not know that when the great breathing majority of the huge population of this city have done their labors for what they call the day, the minority awaken and commence theirs? Surely even you, Herbert, are sufficiently learned in Philadelphia life to know that the curtains of many couches are only undrawn at such an hour as this, that the occupants may rise and fulfil their mission—that at such a time as this the doors of many houses only open. Come with me, and if you wish, I will turn over for you a new leaf in the great book of experiences, and present to you Philadelphia life in a new and not unamusing place."</p>
               <p>"I tremble, Charles."</p>
               <p>"So do I."</p>
               <p>"I seem as though some invisible monitor besought me not to go."</p>
               <p>"My former feelings exactly. This way, Herbert, and here we are.</p>
               <p>No one will question you. You are a friend of mine, that is all; and if by chance any one should say anything to you, make your way to me. Herbert, you understand?"</p>
               <p>Insensibily to Herbert, who had been deeply occupied with the topic of his companion's discourse, Charles had led him through many streets and squares to the heart of the city; and now he stopped at what appeared to be a very quiet, respectable, private mansion in a street leading from Walnut-street. There was nothing about the exterior of the house to mark it as what it really was, namely, a gambling-house of the first quality, which means the worst quality. Not a light was to be seen in any of the windows, and only a very faint one in the hall, and not the vestige of a sound disturbed the stillness of the structure.</p>
               <p>Some immediately contiguous church clock struck one!</p>
               <p>"In good time," said Charles Horton, as he ascended the two steps that led to the door of the mansion.</p>
               <p>"Charles, I pause—I shrink——"</p>
               <p>Charles dropped the arm of Herbert on the moment, and turning on the steps, he faced him.</p>
               <p>"My good friend," he said, "this is a moment in which we must understand each other. There is your road to your attic. This is my California. You shall not say afterwards that I tempted you to this place. I offer you its advantages and chances. You may embrace them, or reject them, as you will; but you shall not have an opportunity afterwards of exalting me into the Mephistopheles of your imagination."</p>
               <p>"But it is madness for me to go within the doors of such a place. I am penniless."</p>
               <p>"My purse is my friend's. I will lend you money to win money. What you win will then be your own. Do you prefer to borrow of me with no prospect of repayment before you? If so, only say so, and name your wants."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no—no. My dress is rather——"</p>
               <p>"Pho! Men look very little, even at each other's faces in this place, and never at their coats. Their gold is all that attracts attention, and yours shall be as bright as any man's. You come with a free will?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. With a free will."</p>
               <p>"That is nobly spoken. Now, you are, indeed, the Herbert I always thought you; and without a doubt your wife and child will, in the comforts that surround them like household blessings, soon smile upon your decision. Is it not better that the gold, that would otherwise go but to swell the licentiousness of some thing of vile passions, should find its way to a home such as you can make, in which refinement shall be the handmaiden of luxury, and gentle charity the destiny of both? In truth, my dear fellow, you have decided well."</p>
               <p>Herbert thought he had.</p>
               <p>There was no bell-pull visible on the door of the gambling-house; but hidden in the moulding of the door-frame was a small disc of metal, which Charles pressed upon with his thumb, and in the course of about half a minute the door was opened.</p>
               <p>"A pass?" said a voice.</p>
               <p>"At all times yes," said Charles.</p>
               <p>"All's right, sir," growled the voice; and in another moment Herbert and his friend were in the dimly lighted hall of the house.</p>
               <p>Charles took Herbert by the arm, and led him on rapidly. A door was passed, and they were in profound darkness then.</p>
               <p>"How many friends?" said a voice, that sounded decidedly feminine.</p>
               <p>"As many as will live, and let live, whoever the other two may be," replied Charles.</p>
               <p>"Game, or the Hunter?" said the voice again.</p>
               <p>"A new face," said Charles, "and money's worth. I answer for all questions without a shadow."</p>
               <p>Suddenly there came a powerful flash of light, such as might be cast from some mirror, right upon Herbert's face, and he paused a moment, bewildered by the glare of light in which he found himself, before he could speak, however, the light was gone again, leaving his eyes painfully affected by a thousand brilliant tints.</p>
               <p>"What was that?" said Herbert, at length.</p>
               <p>"Nothing of moment," whispered Charles. "The presiding divinity only wished to know you again, that was all. Come on with confidence. You are in no danger."</p>
               <p>"I do not apprehend any; but that dazzling, reflected light has confused my eyes."</p>
               <p>"They will quickly recover in this darkness. Walk on confidently. Are you better now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Oh, yes."</p>
               <p>"We will pause a little, if you prefer it, for we shall soon be where there is plenty of light. Only say that you would rather wait a little, and I will do so. There need be no hurry."</p>
               <p>"No. The confusion has gone off. I am quite ready."</p>
               <p>In silence, then, Charles led him on; and then Herbert heard, or thought he heard, the sound of a door opening; but still all was darkness. That state, however, was not to last many moments, for Charles<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8050-00000011"/> drew back a massive curtain of quilted velvet, and in another moment a scene burst upon the view of Herbert, which, for a brief space, thoroughly confused him.</p>
               <p>The curtain had covered a long narrow orifice in the wall of one of the most brilliant rooms that imagination, could picture.</p>
               <p>The whole of the walls were hung with the same velvet of which the portion closing the orifice was composed. The color was a rich purple, and a deep fringe of gold bullion terminated it, and swept upon the floor, while a profusion of massive tassels and cords of the same gorgeous character crossed and depended from the walls in all directions. The ceiling was exquisitely painted; and if the painter had been a little free in his manner of treating the subject, he had more than compensated for that by the great ability with which the picture was executed. At certain intervals round the ceiling hung glass chandeliers, carrying many gas lights, and leaving the centre of the saloon clear. One large table was in this luxurious apartment, covered with cloth; and dispersed in all directions were ottomans of the same material. Upon marble slabs, projecting from one of the walls, refreshments of the most inviting order were placed, but not a soul was in the room.</p>
               <p>As Herbert trod upon the rich carpeting into which the feet sunk noiselessly as into snow, he gazed around him with the vague look of one suddenly awakened, who yet doubts if he is in the world of dreams or not.</p>
               <p>"This is the ante-room," said Charles.</p>
               <p>"Ante-room to what?"</p>
               <p>"To the play rooms. Hush! do you not hear?"</p>
               <p>Herbert listened; and the hum of voices came upon his ears from somewhere close at hand; and then before he could ask another question of his friend, a similar portion of the velvet hanging was raised to that which had shaded the entrance through which they had passed, and a man appeared. The stranger was young, and there was about his face a tender beauty. He was pale as monumental marble. The veins upon his forehead stood out clear and strong. There was a wild preternatural fire in his eyes, and blood was trickling from his lips. He staggered through the room, and lifting the velvet screen from the entrance through which Herbert and Charles had passed, he left the ante-room.</p>
               <p>Like a spectre this man had passed between Sinclair and the light.</p>
               <p>"Who—who," he gasped, "is he?"</p>
               <p>"A loser," said Charles. "They should smother that shriek!"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III</head>
               <head type="sub">THE GAMBLER'S DEATH.</head>
               <p>HERBERT sickened as he heard that cry of horror, and for a moment he felt himself compelled to hold by the velvet hangings nearest to him for support. Charles went to a side-table, and hastily pouring himself out a bumper of wine, he tossed it off.</p>
               <p>"Charles," said Herbert, "you heard that cry—you saw that man?"</p>
               <p>"I saw the man first, and I heard him afterwards," said Charles, heedlessly.</p>
               <p>"It matters not," added Herbert, "the order in which the events come. Let it suffice that I am horrified."</p>
               <p>"Well! The result?"</p>
               <p>"May I not well, with such a sound in my ears, Charles, recoil from further progress into this room?"</p>
               <p>"You may remember, if you wish to do so. It is at your own option. But remember your home. If the horrors of this place, as exemplified in the person of one gambler, who has had something to lose and who has lost it, are so great that you—who have nothing to lose but all to win—can rather face your starving wife and child than those terrors, why, in the name of all that in poor and petty in humanity, I pray you to go."</p>
               <p>Herbert was silent.</p>
               <p>"I say again," continued Charles, "I will not play the part of your tempter to such a place as this. We met as boys at school. We are now men; and as a man, with his judgment clearly about him, I show you a path that may lead to fortune. It is for you to determine to tread it or not, as you think fit."</p>
               <p>Before Herbert could reply, the curtain was again drawn aside, and from the play-rooms there issued a man in full evening costume. The flush of pleasure was upon his brow, the light of success beamed from his eyes, and a radiant smile sat upon his face. As he passed out of the ante-room he bowed slightly, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Good evening, gentlemen!"</p>
               <p>Both Herbert and Charles acknowledged the polite salutation; and when he was gone, Charles tapped Herbert lightly upon the arm, as he said—</p>
               <p>"Why, my friend, you are in luck; you have seen both sides of the medal in the course of a few minutes."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Do you not understand me? You have seen the winner and the loser. Did you note how lightly that man's bosom's lord sat upon its throne? Did you see his jocund look? Ha! ha! my friend! Even a gaming-house is something like the great world without—a creditable enough sample, as far as money goes, of what is ever doing beneath the sun; for here, as everywhere, you will find tears and smiles."</p>
               <p>"It is so," said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"In sober truth it is so, my friend. In truth you are lucky to-night<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8050-00000012"/> night. Who shall say that the Blind Goddess may not pursue you with her smiles, even to the play-tables? She is fond of fresh faces."</p>
               <p>"I will not be scared by trifles," added Herbert. "You have concealed nothing from me, Charles. "I will cast off the old time prejudices against gambling, and for once, if you supply me with the means, I will have a stand-up fight with cruel fortune."</p>
               <p>"Boldly spoken. Now I know you again, as my old, brave, chivaltous schoolmate, who would do and dare what others shrank from. Take this purse. In it you will find enough wherewith to stake against fortune. If you win, repay me. If you lose, 'tis but a trifle, and we will laugh it off. Come! Let us go the tables. There is a strong muster to-night, I fancy, by the faint murmurs that reach us from the rooms. This way, Herbert, this way, Cheerily, my old friend, cheerily. Who knows but to-morrow's sun sees you rich?"</p>
               <p>"Rich!" exclaimed Herbert. "What a sound the word has!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and if to you it has a glowing, glorious sound, what must it have to the million who do not as you do, look beneath the surface of mere words to find what they are worth? Come—come! Or will you drink first? One glass of this champague will warm your blood. Only one glass. It will lend color to your cheek—clearness to your mind."</p>
               <p>Herbert drank the goblet rather than the glass of wine which Charles handed to him; and then they both made their way through that opening in the arras that had been in sight of Herbert twice lifted, and in a moment they were in the first gambling-saloon.</p>
               <p>This apartment was octagonal, and at each of the sides there was a table right up against the wall, while in the wall itself was a kind of recess, in which sat a man, who was the banker of that table, and against whom any one might play, although the players might, if they choose, take each other for antagonists, in which case the bank only claimed a per centage upon the winnings.</p>
               <p>The tables were covered with fine blue cloth, smooth as the surface of a billiard-table; and over every one of them was a small chandelier, with a plate of ground glass at the bottom of it, so that its light was thrown down upon the table without the slightest glare or tremulousness. Indeed the effect was as near that of actual daylight as possible.</p>
               <p>The room was richly carpeted, and the ceiling, like that of the ante-room, was painted in an allegorical subject; but it was cloudy and misty, and evidently not intended to attract observation. Probably it was thought that few would, in that room, look up at the ceiling while such enticing proceedings were taking place upon those little blue tables against the walls.</p>
               <p>Hence, then, it will be understood that there were eight tables; and when Sinclair and his friend, Charles Horton reached the room, most of those tables were fully occupied.</p>
               <p>Charles whispered to Herbert, "We will see both the rooms before we play. Follow me."</p>
               <p>Proceeding quite across the play-room, they passed through a very narrow space left between two of its sides, and at once found themselves selves in another apartment of smaller size but of similar shape and general arrangement. Beyond that room again they went into a long rambling-looking apartment, that was very dimly lighted indeed, and then pausing, Charles said—</p>
               <p>"Some of the most habitual frequenters of this house have formed themselves into a club or society; to which I do not belong; so I can't introduce you; and in that case, we have seen all that we can see of the establishment"</p>
               <p>"It is enough," said Herbert. Shall we go back to the play-rooms?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, at once."</p>
               <p>Herbert still clutched the heavy purse that Charles Horton had put into his hands; and the more he did so grasp it, the more anxious he felt to test its strength against some of the piles of gold and notes that he had seen lying upon the small tables. Charles Horton was not slow to perceive that the spirit of gambling, which lies at the bottom of every human being's heart, was fairly aroused in Herbert, and he at once led him to one of the tables.</p>
               <p>"Chance fifty dollars on rouge," said Charles.</p>
               <p>"Fifty dollars?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. It won't look well on your first evening here to trouble the tables for trilling stakes. Lay down a bill for fifty dollars. You will find several in the purse. Your per centage, if you win, you can pay in change."</p>
               <p>"Rouge!" said Herbert, as he laid his fifty-dollar bill upon the table.</p>
               <p>There was for a few moments a Babel of voices, as the game was made. Rouge it was, and Herbert found himself the legitimate owner of fifty dollars. He turned hot and cold by turns, and his brain reeled again, as he held the bill in his nervous grasp. Oh, what a word of thought hustled through his brain at that moment.</p>
               <p>Away to the old dingy attic flew his imagination, and in a series of pictures of the fancy he saw what that fifty dollars, during the dreary winter that had nearly passed away, would have done for those whom he loved. That fifty dollars that was won without an effort—lost without a thought!</p>
               <p>He saw the blazing fires that would have made successful war against the winter's cold. He saw the warm clothing that would have lent a glow to the wan cheeks of Clara and his child. He saw the well-laid board—the rich repast and the small dainties that her feminine nature, and the weak hold of existence that his child had required. He saw the smiles that that sum would purchase—the nods and becks—the life service of many. He saw the tears of gushing gratitude, that only a small portion of it, dispensed in the name of blessed and holy charity, would bring forth, and he felt, indeed, what an enchanter money was!</p>
               <p>Charles tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Lost or won?"</p>
               <p>"Won!"</p>
               <p>"Good. Go on. When a gambler begins to win he feels like some<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8050-00000013"/> miser who has lit upon at vein of gold, and he should not rise from it until he has made some of its bright possessions his. Go on."</p>
               <p>The word gambler, grated a little upon the ear of Herbert; but he did not give it more than a moment's passing thought. Throwing down both the fifty dollar bills, he again called—</p>
               <p>"Rouge!"</p>
               <p>The game took some time to make, during which Herbert could not but gaze at the calm, impassable face of the banker, who, more like some automatan than a living man, presided over such an abundance of wealth. That man won without exultation, lost without a sigh. It was his trade, and use had deadened all the sensations with which he first began it. He knew that in the long run, the tables must win—he had made his calculations, and he was content to abide the result like a mere piece of mechanism.</p>
               <p>And now came the death-like stillness after the making of the game to the announcement of its result. Herbert breathed thickly and with laborious spasms. There were those near him who had ten times the amount dependent upon the turn of the card, but who did not, by the slightest movement betray any agitation.</p>
               <p>The bank lost again, and Herbert swept in his stakes. The room for a moment seemed to reel round with him. Charles spoke to him in a low voice, saying—</p>
               <p>"Go on—Fortune is with you—Go on, Herbert. All will be well: I have known a run of luck against the bank at times, of a most amazing character."</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes—I have heard and read of——"</p>
               <p>"But not so loud. You will attract attention."</p>
               <p>Herbert was silent in a moment. The dread of ridicule was a powerful feeling in his nature. He then heard the monotonous voice of the banker, saying, "Make your game, gentleman! Make your game!" The two hundred dollars he staked and won again. How the hot blood mounted to his brow, and how insignificant now seemed that fifty dollars which he at first won, and which was to do such great things. He lost count of what he actually won now; for his brains were in such a ferment, that he was not sufficiently master of calm reasoning to divide his winnings from his stakes.</p>
               <p>"Fortune favours you to-night, sir."</p>
               <p>These words were twice spoken before Herbert found that they proceeded from a gentlemanly-looking-man, of about middle age, who had at the moment quietly insinuated himself into a seat close to Herbert. There was a quiet thoughtful look about the stranger; but even Herbert, confused and excited as he was, could see that it was a gentleman who spoke to him. He hastily apologised for his unintended rudeness in not answering at once; and then in as easy a tone as he could assume, he said in reply.</p>
               <p>"I have not very often to accuse Fortune of such an amount of blindness. No doubt she will change her mood."</p>
               <p>"Is she so fickle with you? Well, will you play with me instead of the bank, which, after all, is cold and lifeless antagonist?"</p>
               <p>"With pleasure."</p>
               <p>At a signal, a noiseless attendant brought a pack of cards, and the stranger shuffled them, and handed them to Herbert to do the same saying as he did so—</p>
               <p>"We play for the excitement of winning or losing rapidly. Any pull upon the mind in the way of a game is tiresome. Let us have the pack before us, and each draw twelve cards, and then shuffle the whole again. You shall pay for all of one color, and I for all of the other. Will that do?"</p>
               <p>"It is quite fair," said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"Necessarily so. Take which color you like."</p>
               <p>"Rouge. I have been winning upon it."</p>
               <p>"Very good. Now, then, for me. And the stakes?"</p>
               <p>"What you please."</p>
               <p>"Fifties, then, to begin with. Here goes, then. Oh, Genius of Noir! befriend me now."</p>
               <p>We need not follow the fluctuations of this game, which was about as pure a bit of sheer gambling as any two rational beings could sit down to; suffice it that, in one hour, Herbert had won of the stranger no less a sum than four thousand dollars. The effect upon Herbert upon this amount of winning—this golden shower that had fallen upon him—was quite the reverse of that which had been produced by the first small sum that had found its way to his hands. He now no longer cast one thought to home, or to those who were there. His whole soul was wrapped up in the spirit of acquisition. To win was his life now. The Demon of Avarice—a gambler's avarice—had taken possession of him utterly!</p>
               <p>When he spoke it was in a dry, harsh voice, as though he would chide his antagonist for not raising the cards quickly enough, so that he might win still more.</p>
               <p>Upon the stranger, the only effect of his large loss was to make him turn very pale, while his eyes seemed to dilate; and at times the forced laugh that came from his lips was awful to hear. He laid his hand upon the top card of the newly shuffled pack, and in a low voice, that was only heard by Herbert, he said—</p>
               <p>"One thousand"</p>
               <p>"What mean you?"</p>
               <p>"One thousand upon this."</p>
               <p>"Agreed. Rouge! Ha! it is mine!"</p>
               <p>"Another thousand upon this!" said the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Go on. Yes—yes. How the lights fire our eyes. Go on. A thousand be it. Lost by Heaven?"</p>
               <p>"Two thousand?" said the stranger.</p>
               <p>Herbert was eager to recover his one thousand that he had just lost, and he at once agreed. The luck had turned. In twenty minutes he was a beggar again. Not only had his brilliant gain fled like a vapor, but the purse that Charles Horton had given him dropped from his hand to the floor, empty and without a sound. He rose from the table, and staggered across the room. The first person he encountered was Charles; and grasping him by the breast, he said, in a hissing whisper—</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8050-00000014"/>
               <p>"All lost! A little fortune blown to the winds! All lost!"</p>
               <p>"Lost?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; all—all! I had beauty—music—homage—all in my grasp for a moment, and they have fled again! It was Fairy Gold, and it has turned to seared leaves! Lost! lost! lost!—or is it a dream?"</p>
               <p>He held his hands over his eyes for a few moments, during which Charles whispered to him, in tones of agitation—</p>
               <p>"Herbert, I consoled myself with the idea that you were winning. I never passed such a night as this in these rooms. I am severely damaged. A couple of thousands do me some harm to lose. I am staggered."</p>
               <p>"At one time I had three times that amount."</p>
               <p>"Three times, and all gone?"</p>
               <p>"All—all! There lies your empty purse. Say what you will, Charles, now I am your debtor. Go on—go on."</p>
               <p>"You mistake me entirely, if you fancy that any reproaches are about to come from my lips for the loss of what I told you to risk, Herbert. But to whom have you lost it? The table?"</p>
               <p>"No. There stands the winner."</p>
               <p>"By the shades of darkness, it is the very man who won all from me, Herbert. I was playing in the inner room, believing you all safe, and he won of me as I tell you. He must have only passed from me to you mulet us both"</p>
               <p>Herbert laughed faintly, and Charles caught him eagerly by the arm, saying—</p>
               <p>"What ails you, man? Come out of the play-room, if you cannot command yourself better than this. Come—come."</p>
               <p>He led Herbert unresistingly into the ante-room, and not for a moment relaxing his hold of him until they reached the side-board, upon which the wine was placed in such profusion, he struck off the upper part of the neck of a bottle of champague, and pouring the enticing draught into a pint goblet, he handed it to Herbert.</p>
               <p>"Drink."</p>
               <p>Herbert drank as though it had been so much water. The color came to his cheek again, and it seemed as if an accession of more spirit-stiring blood had bounded through the vessels of his brain. Before he could speak, Charles drew him back far away to a remote part of the room, and pointing to the curtain, as it was drawn aside to permit some one to pass out of the play-room, he whispered—</p>
               <p>"Look, there is the man!"</p>
               <p>"The—man—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he who is walking with your wife's jewels, dresses, home comforts, warmth, carriage, house, rich furnishings, your child's toys, pretty baubles that childhood loves, and your own more manly enjoyments—that man carries off all—all with him now? Look with what a sunny and smirking air he trimly walks under the burthen!"</p>
               <p>"What, in the name of all that's incomprehensible and horrible, mean you?" said Herbert.</p>
               <p>"Is it not plain? Does he not take away the bright gold that would have done all that?"</p>
               <p>"God, he does!"</p>
               <p>"Carries he not with him the jingling Genii who can give all that I have mentioned to you, and a thousand times more? Is it not so? Do not tell me that you understand me not. You know that it is so. There, look at him. He smiles—he walks on, on—he is gone!"</p>
               <p>"The villain!"</p>
               <p>"Hush—hush? Come on. Villain is a hard word. Come on. The cold air without will do you good, and we have no more gold to lose now, so we are out of place. Come—come quickly. Why that man has in his pocket now—and all unhallowed gain too, from the gaming table—what would make you and your's happier than princes. All your refined tastes and habits would find the ready means of gratification."</p>
               <p>"Yes. Oh, Heaven, yes!"</p>
               <p>Herbert staggered along by the side of Charles. They passed, he knew not how, through the dark room. They reached the hall. The door was open, and they sallied out into the street. The rain had ceased, and a few stars peeped out from amid the drifting clouds.</p>
               <p>"There he goes," said Charles: "he turns yon corner. On, Herbert, on!"</p>
               <p>Herbert obeyed the impulse to follow the stranger, he knew not why. It was but an impulse, and he yielded to it. He asked not whither it would lead him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE WINNER LOSES LIFE AND MONEY.</head>
               <p>HOW keen the night-air blew, and with what a sudden gust it flashed in Herbert's face, as, with Charles Horton, he turned the corner. There was ice upon the blast.</p>
               <p>Charles Herbert needed not the inclemency of the season, but Herbert shuddered as he faced the fierce chilling air, which each moment was more and more loaded with drifting icy particles, each one of which seemed to be discharged by some more than common power in the faces of those who, at such an hour, were exposed to the fury of the season.</p>
               <p>"There," again cried Horton; "there goes your fortune through the snow-drift. Ha!—ha! There it flies! They always said gold had wings; and now we see the truth of the assertion. After it—after it, Herbert. Follow me. This way—this way."</p>
               <p>Still, without a thought of what was to be accomplished by this race, Herbert Sinclair rushed after the man who, with thousands in his pocket, seemed truly, to the imagination of that half-maddened loser, to be like some one who was robbing him, his wife, and his child, of all those rare gifts of fortune that Charles Horton had so rapidly enumerated. If he, Herbert, had only paused for a moment, thought would have resumed its sway; but, as he was, he knew nothing, felt<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8050-00000015"/> nothing, but that he was urged on in a race for gold; and the feeling that came over him was something like that which he had experienced when actually seated at the gaming-table in the brilliant saloon of that house of splendid iniquity which he had so recently quitted.</p>
               <p>And now the driving shower of sleet began indeed to merit something like the appellation of a snow-drift, for it came in heavier masses; so that it had the effect, in a great measure, of stilling the wind, which else would have roared and whistled through the deserted streets. The ground was soon covered with a fleecy mantle; but yet, through the white misty atmosphere—misty with snow flakes and small particles of ice—Herbert could still see the man who carried off his fortune; and he still pursued him.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Charles grasped Herbert by the arm; and in a whisper, he said to him—</p>
               <p>"Follow me closely."</p>
               <p>"But—he—"</p>
               <p>"I know not what you would say. Follow me. I know him and his route. He will cross the river, now that he has got so far this way. There was a doubt, but it has passed now; and I know his destination. Follow me, and you shall see him again."</p>
               <p>Why or for what purpose he was to see that man again, Herbert did not pause to ask. It seemed at that time sufficient to his mind that he should not lose sight of the glittering gold that had been his temptation, and that, for such a brief period, had lit up the chamber of his soul with joy, only again to extinguish the brave lights, and leave them darker again than the tomb.</p>
               <p>With the locality in which they were, Charles seemed, and was perfectly familiar. While the winner of the stakes at the gaming-table made his way in the open, broad thoroughfare to the dock, thinking that the safest—for he had a perception of being dogged by some one or two persons—Charles led Herbert through some back streets and alleys at great speed, until they emerged right on to the very wharf.</p>
               <p>What a staggering gush of cold air came from the water!</p>
               <p>"On!—On!" cried Charles.</p>
               <p>He went on to the wharf, and Herbert followed him. At a distance of about twenty yards Charles paused.</p>
               <p>They then concealed themselves behind a pile of lumber. Here they were tolerably well protected from the sleet and the snow, as the wind came from another direction than that which they now faced—but they could hear the foam of the river as it dashed and foamed along; and it seemed as if the very spirit of chill desolation was abroad, and calling, in wailing accents, to kindred fiends to come and play rude riot on land and on water!</p>
               <p>Charles held Herbert by the arm, and whispered to him.</p>
               <p>"Herbert Sinclair, the man who has won your gold—the man who carries with him all that would make you and those whom you love great, and happy and respected, is a villain—a swindler—a cheat—one who, in an hour to-morrow, will transfer to some other hollow-hearted hearted debauchee the money that would enable you to rise like a phoenix from the ashes, and blaze triumphantly before the world!"</p>
               <p>"'Tis madness!"</p>
               <p>"What is madness?"</p>
               <p>"To think of it! Oh, Clara!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, Clara! Your wife's name ought to be a spell. Perhaps you took her from warmth, smiles, comfort and happiness, to starve in your attic. Ha! ha! How long will want and misery take to make her anything but the Clara of your dreams?"</p>
               <p>"Mercy! Mercy!"</p>
               <p>"Your child, too. A poor and delicate little thing, with such a world of intellect in even its young face. How-hollow-eyed and sharp-visaged it begins to look!"</p>
               <p>"Let me go! The river is at hand. In the Lethe of its dark and turbid waters I shall at last find peace! Let me go! I say!"</p>
               <p>"He comes!"</p>
               <p>"Heaven will forgive me, and pitying angels will plead that I did not basely desert the trust that Providence had placed in me by giving me Clara and my child; for to them I can be nothing but another picture of desolation. When I am gone, the gaping world will raise one of its hypocritical howls over my fate, and befriend them. Let me go, I say!"</p>
               <p>"No—not while I can find nerve to grasp you. What would you do?"</p>
               <p>"Die! die!"</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! Leave death to others. <emph>He</emph> comes who will change all this dying mood in you. He has wrested from you that which would have made you happy, beneath the soft, seductive light of the chandeliers in the Gaming Saloon. You can wrest the same from him beneath the dim light of Heaven, which yet shines sufficient, even through the drifting storm-clouds above, to light you to the act."</p>
               <p>At this instant there came such a gush of wind, that every lamp, which had hitherto withstood the boisterous element, was in a moment extinguished, and amid the crash of broken glass there was, for the moment, a protracted gloom upon and about the place. The roar of the water then rose with a hissing surge again; and as the eyes of Herbert got each moment more and more accustomed to the night air, he could see about him dimly.</p>
               <p>"What is it?" he said, in a hoarse whisper. "Oh, Charles, by the memory of our ancient friendship, I would ask you what it is you would tempt me to?"</p>
               <p>"Tempt you?"</p>
               <p>"No—no; I will not use that word. But what is it you would have me do now? Speak—oh, speak!"</p>
               <p>"Take what was your own. Play another stake! Have another throw with fortune, and see if you can win. I tell you <emph>he</emph> is coming."</p>
               <p>"I know it. Hush!"</p>
               <p>"Close with him, and wrest from him his unhallowed gains."</p>
               <p>"I—think—I—will! My brain is on fire! I cannot—will not go<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8050-00000016"/> home as I am, after this feverish dream of joy and wealth. I should go mad! mad! mad! Is he coming?"</p>
               <p>"Hush! You will do it?"</p>
               <p>"I will!"</p>
               <p>"Grapple him as he comes opposite to here. You are strong, young and active. Have the money from him. I will help you!"</p>
               <p>"You will? You are sure of that?"</p>
               <p>Charles grasped the arm of Herbert so tightly that at any other time the pressure would have been painful, but the mind was now too highly wrought to heed a small amount of physical suffering. Herbert was like one in a battle, who in the excitement of the moment feels no wound.</p>
               <p>"He comes!" was all that Charles could now say. "He comes!"</p>
               <p>Herbert's sense of hearing now seemed to himself to have suddenly become preternaturally acute. He distinctly heard the footsteps of some one on the wharf, and on the same side of it, too, on which he and Horton were. It was natural that all should take that side—it was the one that was protected from the weather. The footsteps were not hasty. They were like those of a man who for a time had made great speed, and then finding, or thinking he found, that the necessity for doing so had ceased, walks more leisurely than usual, or than the night would warrant.</p>
               <p>Herbert counted the steps—one, two, three, four, five, six. He reached the spot where they stood.</p>
               <p>"For Clara!" whispered Charles.</p>
               <p>There hardly needed such an invocation.</p>
               <p>Herbert for the time was mad. With a yell that rose superior to the wailing of the wind and the surging dash of the water, he sprung upon the victim.</p>
               <p>Herbert caught him by the throat, but the man attacked had a weapon in his hand. It was a small dirk-knife, and he inflicted in the surprise of the moment a slight flesh wound upon Herbert, at the same time, that feeling the iron grasp upon his neck, he shouted—</p>
               <p>"Murder! murder!"</p>
               <p>Herbert felt that he was wounded, and he became a fiend in desperation. Catching the man by the arm, he wrenched the dirk-knife from him; but still, for a moment or two, so fierce was the struggle, that he could not well use it. They neared the edge of the dock.</p>
               <p>"Over with him!" said Charles. "Over with him into the river!"</p>
               <p>"Murder!" again shouted the man.</p>
               <p>Herbert bent him backwards towards the water, and with one blow he buried the dirk to the hilt in his bosom. Another moment and the night air was rent by a fearful shriek. Another, and the dead body fell from the wharf. With a crash it struck against some projection of the wharf, and then, a mangled mass of quivering inanimation, it cleaved the dark' waters and was gone.</p>
               <p>"Murder!" shrieked Herbert, as he held at arm's length the bloodstained knife. "Murder!" he again shouted.</p>
               <p>Charles sprang upon him, and held a portion of his clothing over his face, to stop the mad cry that he uttered.</p>
               <p>"Fool—idiot!" he said. "Do you want to make more alarm than is already upon the night air? What do you mean by shouting murder thus?"</p>
               <p>"Did—I—Oh, God!"</p>
               <p>"Hush! Give me that dagger. There, it is gone. I have the money. Whilst you struggled with him, I cut off the skirt of his coat, in which he had it all. The deed is done, and it has succeeded. We have the gold. You have won at last."</p>
               <p>"Won! won!"</p>
               <p>"Yes. What do you stare at in such a way? I can see your eyes like balls of fire, even in the darkness. Come away—come away."</p>
               <p>"Hush, the—Hush!"</p>
               <p>"What is it—What do you listen for?"</p>
               <p>"He is coming again! Ghastly and mangled, he is coming again! He is climbing from the water, and up—up—the slippery side of the wharf. There, do you not hear him? He breathes hard, and upon the slimy green logs that touch the tide, he slips in blood. With his nails he clutches the crevices, and comes up—up to me. The roaring wind helps him, and a thousand mocking devils hold up his mangled limbs, to greet me with a sight of horror. Help! mercy! help! His glazed eye is upon me, and from his wounds spont forth hot gore——"</p>
               <p>Charles clutched him by the collar, and by one arm dragged him forcibly along.</p>
               <p>When once Charles got Herbert upon a run, he continued it with the same mechanical impulse that at such a time he would have continued any action. He would have shouted murder in the same way, had he been encouraged to do so. There was likewise one great thing that Horton gained by keeping him at such speed, and that was that he could not rave as he had raved.</p>
               <p>They got off the bridge almost unnoticed. But a policeman came up to them as they went up Walnut street.</p>
               <p>"All right!" said Horton. "My friend has had a drop too much to-night, that is all, and I am getting him home. Do you know if there is a hack handy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—plenty."</p>
               <p>The appearance of Charles was prepossessing, but the policeman followed them until they hailed a hack, and as, by great good luck, all that Herbert said was "More wine!" the policeman was tolerably satisfied.</p>
               <p>"No.—, Chesnut street," said Charles.</p>
               <p>The policeman noticed the address, and the hack rolled up the street.</p>
               <p>After they had gone some distance, Charles bade the coachman stop, and said—</p>
               <p>"That will do. Stop, and we will get out here, and pay you your full fare?"</p>
               <p>This was satisfactory enough, so the hack-driver received more than his fare, and returned to his stand, while Charles led Herbert some distance, until the reached George's street. At one of the houses in this street Charles paused, and opening the door with a night-key that<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8050-00000017"/> he took hastily from his pocket, he drew Herbert into the entry of the house. Is was intensely dark.</p>
               <p>"Wait still a moment," whispered Charles.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Herbert, so faintly that it seemed as though all strength had left him—and so indeed it had. The frightful exertion of mind and body he had gone through had brought with it its inevitable reaction, and he was now scarcely able to speak or to support himself.</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes."</p>
               <p>Charles appeared in a few moments with a light, and led Herbert into a large and handsome room, which opened from the hall.</p>
               <p>"Come," he said, "you will be all well in a few hours."</p>
               <p>"All well," said Herbert, faintly.</p>
               <p>"Rest is what you want. That is all. Drink this. It will recover you. I think you may trust me now, Herbert. It is not poison."</p>
               <p>Charles smiled, and Herbert tried to return the smile, but it was a failure. He drank off the liquid that Charles offered him, and then, staggering to a sofa, he sunk down upon it, and closing his eyes, he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
               <p>For about five minutes Charles Horton stood watching him until he felt quite sure that the sleep was sound and regular; and then he spoke in a low deep tone—</p>
               <p>"Sleep on. The opiate has done its work quickly. Sleep on, Herbert Sinclair, I know you well; and never again, but by the aid of some such drug as this; shall you sleep soundly again. That is more than settled. And now I think I have that which I have long wanted—one who dares not refuse to obey me. I hold the life of this weak, yet hold man in my hands, and what will be more terrifying, by far, to him, I hold his reputation. The dread of his wife, who is so very far from knowing this night's proceedings, will give me such a clutch of his heart that he cannot escape me except by death."</p>
               <p>Charles Horton paced the room for several seconds, and then pausing, he again bent his gaze upon Herbert.</p>
               <p>"No," he said. "He will now be afraid to die. Men with great crimes upon their souls do not die so readily. They are afraid to face the grim king of terrors. Now I have a male and female victim. Mrs. Mortville, so far as her means go, dare not say me nay. She is safe, for I know that she had a secret she would not be let known for all the world. I much wonder now what Staunton did that made him fly through the streets with such a hound-like course. But he is dead. I was in luck to meet him. She must not know that he is dead; and if she does, why the story will tell nearly as well. Ha, ha! I shall grow rich and powerful in time. Dull witted fools wait for the circumstances that shall show them the way to greatness, but I commence initially, and make the circumstances, and so step on to my desires by a royal road. Sleep on, Herbert Sinclair; you are mine now—my victim and my slave!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE ESCAPE OF THE MADMAN, AND THE DEATH OF HIS VICTIM.</head>
               <p>ON that eventful night which plunged poor Herbert into such a sea of ruin, there were other events occurring, of a fearful interest to him and his. It was truly a time for him and his fortunes of terrific conjunctions.</p>
               <p>About one hour before the poor miserable maniac had taken the so momentary a refuge in the attic where Herbert Sinclair with his wife and child endured such an amount of poverty, a man crept along the streets leading from the suburbs towards Chestnut street. His manner was such as, if he had been noticed, would have at once subjected him to the active and most scrupulous surveillance of the police.</p>
               <p>At times this man would lift up his hands above his head, and in muttered accents of terrible import, he would imprecate vengeance upon the head of some one whom he did not name, although by the use of the feminine pronoun, it was evident that some female was the object of his profound hatred.</p>
               <p>As this man passed a lamp on that dreary night, his apparel might have been seen to be much disordered. In places it hung about him in shreds, and the old slouched hat he wore seemed hardly able in its decadence to remain upon his head; and yet it was not so much poverty that seemed to have reduced him to such a condition as neglect and violence.</p>
               <p>Whoever and whatever he was, he evidently had some fearful purpose that he dreaded might be frustrated if he drew upon himself the attention of any one.</p>
               <p>It was from this reason that he crouched down so close to the walls; and when he passed a lamp, that he darted on like a hunted deer until he got into the deep shadow again.</p>
               <p>That sad and strange looking man had not the opportunity of choosing for himself the night upon which he should go upon the enterprise that now filled up his whole soul; but had he chosen it, he could not possibly have found one more fitted to his purpose than that on which he was abroad.</p>
               <p>It will be recollected that the wind and the rain had combined to produce as much storm and discomfort as possible; and so, by the time this shrinking, trembling wretch had got to within a very short distance of Chestnut street, he was drenched to the skin, and the cold wind rushed through his torn and scanty apparel. But he heeded not the fury of the storm. A darker fury—a more hideous tempest, was at that time raging in his breast.</p>
               <p>"She shall die!" he muttered. "She shall die. Oh, yes, she shall die to-night. I think that I am mad now; but I was not when they said I was. She shall die. Wretched woman that she is—outcast from all feeling—all goodness—she shall die. I will not tamper with my vengeance. They will kill me, I know, but she shall die; and upon the shores of the unknown world; we shall both meet to-night!"</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8050-00000018"/>
               <p>Now he suddenly darted into an alley, and still crouching down, for he thought that he heard footsteps near him, he scoured along until he faced one of the gorgeous heavy mansions of wealth which line chestnut street.</p>
               <p>He flung himself upon his face, and only just lifting up his head sufficiently, he glared at the mansion; and the short, broken, strange-thrilling laugh that broke from him, was the laugh of a maniac.</p>
               <p>"The key! the key!" he said. "Amid all the buffets, and blows, and curses, and sufferings, they did not find that. I have the key, which in old days opened the road to that apartment wherein, in all the pride and fancied security of her station, she thinks that she will be safe from me; but I will find her. Yes, I will swoop upon her like an eagle on his prey, and she dies to-night—to-night."</p>
               <p>Something hurt him as he lay. It was a large rough stone, and taking it in his left hand, he began rubbing upon it an old key that was blackened with rust; and now and then as he proceeded with his work he uttered hideous laughing exclamations, and still constant only to the one purpose of taking the life of some female; he was in all other respects the incoherent madman.</p>
               <p>Let us change the scene.</p>
               <p>We are now inside the mansion upon which the gaze of the maniac is fixed. It seems to be preternaturally quiet, as such houses, in their immensity of space are, when not thrown open to the gay laughing world, that makes up the society of those who own them. Yet lights are blazing from the richly cut chandeliers, that with their prismatic beauty look like vast collections of rare gems. The gorgeous furniture is fully exposed, and a delicious air of warmth and perfume pervades the place, for the almost regal mistress of that establishment is in town.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mortville is in the drawing-room, usually devoted to the use of the family. We will take a slight glance at this lady.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mortville was turned fifty years of age. She was a woman of uncommon height, and there was in her countenance an expression of stern determination. She looked the person to will a something, and then unflinchingly, like destiny itself, to carry that something fully out. Her lips were usually so firmly compressed, that it looked as though done with an effort, although it was in truth only a long standing habit. She was richly dressed, and yet there were sufficient indications about her costume of widowhood. Yes, Mr. Mortville had expired about fourteen months before that evening, upon which we peep into that gorgeous home of wealth. The widow sat upon a couch, and leant her head upon her arm. She was in deep thought; and if the warring wind without had not been all but hushed into a courtly zephyr by the double windows, and the body of warm air in the house, she would, in her state of abstraction, not having noticed its fury as it whistled and careened without.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mortville rose and paced the room to and fro with uneasy steps, and then snatching an opened letter from her bosom, she stood beneath the chandelier, and in a half-audible voice she read as follows—</p>

                           <p>"He is evidently dying. The weakness that I had the honor of mentioning to you as having supervened is hourly increasing; and by the time when it will be my humble duty to write again, there is every likelihood that I shall be enabled to inform you that the poor afflicted object of your anxious solicitude is no more; in which case your kind proposal to continue the stipend of five hundred dollars per annum, notwithstanding the death of the patient in my asylum will for ever awaken the gratitude of—Madam,</p>

               <p>"Dying!" said Mrs. Mortville. "Dying at last! Well! That will be something, but not what it would have been years gone by. They kept him in existence to vex me. I have felt for years that they did; but now they will kill him because they think that they will get more by that Well, let him die. I shall not be content unless I see him dead. I will trust no one. No—no not one."</p>
               <p>With this, the woman approached the fire-place, and pressing the letter together in her hands into as small a space as possible, she cast it into the flames.</p>
               <p>"Gone," she said, "gone! Oh, would that all my enemies could be as easily disposed of. That Mr. Oliver the lawyer, I know, watches me with the eyes of Argus. What can he suspect? What can he think? Oh, how I hate that man!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Oliver, my lady," announced a servant.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mortville smiled.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Oliver, at such an hour of the night as this!" she said. "Tell him that it is only in the morning that I attend to business, and business people. The insolent!"</p>
               <p>The servant bowed, and was about to leave the room; but the lady, after pressing her hand for a moment upon her head, said, faintly—</p>
               <p>"Stay—I—think—I will see him—Perhaps something of importance—Admit him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lady."</p>
               <p>"I fear, as well as hate that man," muttered Mrs. M.</p>
               <p>She rang a small silver bell, and a lad appeared.</p>
               <p>"Less light," she said.</p>
               <p>The lad bowed and in the course of a few moments the brilliant little gas jets in the chandelier faded down, and a semi-darkness crept over the gorgeous room. The door was thrown open, and Mr. Oliver was announced. Mrs. Mortville made a very slight inclination of her head, as the lawyer bowed.</p>
               <p>"Madam," he said, when the door was gently closed upon them,</p>
               <p>"I should not have troubled you by this visit, did not——</p>
               <p>"No apologies, sir," interrupted the lady. "As the confidential adviser—almost the friend of my late husband, I am always of course, quite at your service."</p>
               <p>The lawyer acknowledged this condescending speech by a very slight inclination of the head; and then he said, in cold, clear tones, that harmonized well with his plain but gentlemanly exterior, and a certain air of sternness about his physiognomy—</p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8050-00000019"/>
               <p>"Madam, I was about to say that at such an hour as this, I should not have troubled you; but knowing that your avocations for the next week will prevent my seeing you——"</p>
               <p>"My avocations, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I quote from your note."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I had quite forgotten. Well, sir, go on."</p>
               <p>"Knowing, then, that I should not have the pleasure of seeing you for some time, I have intruded to-night. You are aware that the whole of the late Mr. M.'s papers were, at his special request, handed over to me on the day succeeding his death. Among those papers I have found rather a singular document.</p>
               <p>The lady rose in agitation; but she controlled herself, and sat down again, as she said, with affected calmness—</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it will be better to show it to my son, when he returns, which will be in the course of the next week."</p>
               <p>"Of that you shall decide," replied Mr. Oliver. "The heir is only twenty-two years of age, as I understand; and this document is not exactly of a nature to add to his peace of mind. It has the following endorsement in the hand-writing of your late husband:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Oliver, please to show this to Mrs. Mortville when I am no more, if I should die before Her, and these papers should come into your hands."</p>
               <p>"Then, I am indebted, sir, for a sight of the document, whatever it is, to the endorsement upon it?"</p>
               <p>"Exactly, Madam"</p>
               <p>"I thought it would be strange if I were indebted to the consideration or the courtesy of Mr. Oliver."</p>
               <p>The lawyer made no answer to this speech whatever; nor did he let it have the slightest effect upon his countenance, voice, or manner, as opened a letter and proceeded in a low clear voice to read it to Mrs. Mortville.</p>
               <p>"To Mr. Mortville, private and confidential:</p>
               <p>"If you feel disposed to acquire a family secret, which will free you from your wife, and make a little difference in the disposition of your property, the writer of this, for the sum of four thousand dollars, secured on your word and honor, will make such disclosures as will astonish you. Please to insert an advertisement in the <title>Morning Ledger,</title> saying, 'Mr. M. accepts,' and the writer of this will solicit an interview, and bring his proofs."</p>
               <p>While this was being read, the lady's face turned of an ashy paleness, and at its conclusion she burst into an hysterical shriek of laughter, which then ceasing, with electric suddenness, she cried—</p>
               <p>"And what is this, sir, to me? this vile, lying cheat—this—this—Oh, it is monstrous that rank, nor wealth, nor good repute can save one from—from—I know not what!"</p>
               <p>"Madam," said Mr. Oliver, "it is for you, and you only, to say how far it concerns you. I have but fulfilled the order of the late Mr. Mortville.</p>
               <p>"And is that all?"</p>
               <p>"It is all, Madam."</p>
               <p>"He did not answer it? He learnt nothing? I mean he took no notice of the libel?"</p>
               <p>"Upon this affair, Madam, you know as much as I do. I find the paper, as I told you, and I fulfil the order endorsed upon it. Having done so, I take my leave."</p>
               <p>"You have not given me the paper, sir."</p>
               <p>"No, Madam, the words of your husband are to show it to you, not give it to you. I still retain it."</p>
               <p>"Insolence! You dare not! My servants shall force from you the odious libel. I will not have a document—a vile scrawl such as that, in any hands. Give it to me, sir. It shall perish. You dare not refuse it to me. It is mine, sir, and I have those about me who will not scruple to obey my orders, and take it from you!"</p>
               <p>"They will have the prudence, Madam, not to attempt it."</p>
               <p>"You would resist?" "With my life. But this is, permit me to say, folly; and in the same spirit that I came, I now take my leave of you."</p>
               <p>"Hold! Ha! ha! I had forgotten. Oh, of course. How very remiss of me. Come, sir—what is the price you put upon that anonymous libel? Tell me what sum you expect for it, and you shall be satisfied. How foolish of me to forget that you were a lawyer! We were, indeed, at cross purposes for nothing. What is the price, sir?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver made no reply, but with a quiet, calm how, he left the room. Mrs. Mortville made a slight movement to follow him, and then she staggered back to the couch again, and sunk upon it with a long-drawn sigh.</p>
               <p>"Is there danger?" she said. "Am I on the brink of some awful discovery? What does that letter mean? Is it not in its appearance of belonging to the years that have mingled with the past, or is it an invention of the time present? Let me think. Let me think."</p>
               <p>She rose and paced the room, muttering to herself for more than half an hour; and then with a haggard face, she abruptly left it, and made her way to a small boudoir, the door of which she always kept locked when she was not in it.</p>
               <p>The hour was getting late; and as she had a sleeping chamber upon the same floor, she dismissed a female attendant who officiously made her appearance, by saying—</p>
               <p>"I have some letters to write, Marie, and shall not retire for some time. I shall not require your attendance."</p>
               <p>The French girl, who was a maid to Mrs. Mortville, curtsied and retired; and then that bold, imperious woman closed the door of the boudoir, and resting her heads upon her hands upon the table, she then shut out all external objects, and gave herself up to deep thought. In about half an hour she lifted up her head and spoke:</p>
               <p>"He grew faint-hearted, and would have told all," she said. "I was quite right to get him confined as a lunatic; and so he is dying. Well, the sooner he draws his last breath the better, now. I tremble at the thought of the few visits he paid me here—ay, even in this house, with the aid of the master-key with which I provided him; but he is dying, and all is safe, very safe—oh, so safe."</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8050-00000020"/>
               <p>A slight noise attracted her attention, and she looked about her anxiously and nervously.</p>
               <p>"It was nothing," she said, "nothing. I have often thought, only I like not exposing the secret of the existence of such a thing to any one, that I would have the opening in the panel yonder fastened up with brick-work; and yet what matters? No one knows it but myself and the dying. Growing weaker hour by hour, Moffat says, and evidently dying. Let him die!"</p>
               <p>She sprang to her feet. Another slight noise had alarmed her. She went gently to the door ol the boudois, and opening it she looked out into the entry beyond. All was still.</p>
               <p>"It was imagination," she said," or some accidental sound from the servant's hall." She then locked the door of the boudoir on the inside, and again she sat down at the rich tapestry-covered table, and her face betrayed a world of anxious thoughts.</p>
               <p>"Let me see," she said. "Theodore will be home from Paris soon to assume his inheritance. That is well. What have I to fear? There are secrets in all families, as well as in this. If I am true to myself all will be well enough. Why do I shake so? I am not used to be so full of fears. Oh, the room must be colder. It is It can be nothing but the cold. I think I will go to rest—rest! I do not often get rest. Imagination makes a fool and a coward of me to-night. I know not why. It must be the ill-timed visit of that man, Oliver, whom I so hate, that has unnerved me—what was that—what was that?"</p>
               <p>Again she sprang to her feet and listened, with terror in every feature of her face, and shaking in every limb.</p>
               <p>"What is it that affrights me?" she said. "Why is it that to-night in particular, I am the slave of a thousand fears, that at other times. I know not? Why does memory bring up before me the forms and events of past years? What was that?"</p>
               <p>Again the strange sound came upon her ears, and she crept to the door she had so recently locked, and laid her hand upon the key, but yet she hesitated to call a servant, for she had about her the consciousness of a life misspent, and she feared nothing so much as what she might say or do in some moment of incaution.</p>
               <p>She dropped her hold of the lock.</p>
               <p>"No—no," she muttered. "I will conquer these vain, foolish fears. I am quite confident it is the ill-timed visit of that man—that Oliver, that has so racked my brain. What did he hope for in bringing me that letter, but to destroy my peace, by making me think that I had a secret foe? Oh, that I were as once I was. Let me think."</p>
               <p>She sank upon a chair, and clasping her hands together, she said softly, while her stern, haughty, defiant look changed to one of almost feminine softness.</p>
               <p>"Thirty years ago I was innocent, and happy and poor—thirty years! Oh, what a long lapse of time! And what have I gained in these thirty years of intrigue, and scheming, and bustle? An aching heart and riches, and bright things around me, some of which have for me not the slightest charm. What else? The most frightful fear—I have gained the privilege of being terrified at what to others of far weaker minds than myself are but matters of inquiry and curiosity; but everything is terrifying to the guilty. The merest common-place phenomena of nature, to them, has a terrible significance, and seems to be directed solely with reference to their compunctious visitations. Oh, that I could feel for one half moment as I felt thirty years ago! Alas—alas!"</p>
               <p>She clutched her face with her hands. She pressed them with force against her brow, as she would make a vain endeavor by so doing to shut out or to stifle the myriad recollections of the past, that would parade themselves before her; and then she spoke again, as though she were compelled to do so at the bidding of some dark sorcerer, to whom she dared not say nay.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was innocent then, and young; and full of hope and expectation, and in the pride of beauty, and health of mind and body, and heart; and now what am I? The demon of ambition whispered to me that I was born for great things, and that I ought not to heed the means by which I achieved them, so that I did achieve them. And what am I now?"</p>
               <p>Again the strange sound came upon her ears and again she looked up in terror.</p>
               <p>"It is something!" she cried. "It is something! These thoughts and feelings are not accidental. This is some hour of unknown importance and danger to me. It is—Oh! God!"</p>
               <p>A concealed door was dashed open in the wall, and in an instant the wretched-looking man whom we have described as sneaking along the streets, with one hand caught her by the throat.</p>
               <p>It was not quite a scream that the lady had uttered, for the clutch that that mad hand held of her was too close to permit the sound to go freely forth; but yet it was such a gurgling cry of horror as might well be supposed to reach some ear in that mansion.</p>
               <p>"Down! Down!" cried the maniac, as he tightened his grasp, and yelled aloud in fierce delight. "Down! Down, fiend in the guise of woman! Down to those regions from which you have come to be a curse and a desolation on earth!"</p>
               <p>She fought wildly with her hands, but he forced back her head until the outstretched muscles of her neck quivered away. He dashed her to the ground, and knelt upon her chest, and still he relaxed not in his hold.</p>
               <p>It was at this moment that a couple of servants, who were in a room below, heard a regular succession of blows against the floor of their mistress's boudoir. At first they listened from curiosity merely, and then they became alarmed. They thought their mistress must be ill and they ran up the staircase; but before they reached the door of the boudoir, they heard such a yelling shriek from the room, that they recoiled in terror, and began loudly calling for help.</p>
               <p>In a few moments the whole house was alarmed. One of the two servants who had heard the cry, ran out into the street, and with almost<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8050-00000021"/> most frantic vehemence called for the police. A couple of officers made their appearance, for once when they were wanted; and in five minutes from the period of the strange bumping noise on the floor, the boudoir was burst open, and the two policemen with all the servants at their back, entered the little room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mortville lay upon her face on the floor, covered with blood, and apparently quite dead. An overturned chair and other evidences of confusion in the room, showed what a struggle had taken place; and there was the secret door in the panel, which no one had known of, although there were servants present who had inhabited the house for years, wide open.</p>
               <p>"This is the way whoever did it has gone," said one of the policemen, as he flashed his lantern through the narrow doorway. "You run round to the garden, if this door leads to it, as I suppose it does, and I'll meet you this way".</p>
               <p>"But we don't know," cried some of the servants, in a breath, "where it leads to."</p>
               <p>"Then I must find out," said the policeman, and he darted with great courage through the secret opening of the wall</p>
               <p>"Fasten up all the doors," said the other, "and some of you show me the nearest way to the garden, for if the fellow than did this is there, we will soon have him."</p>
               <p>The servants kept calling out "Murder! help!" from a sort of instinct; and when they all got down stairs with the policeman, and pointed out to him the way to the garden, and he had gone about half a dozen steps, they suddenly all uttered a united shout, and speeding across the hall in a body, they upset the hall porter, and fell headlong down the kitchen stairs.</p>
               <p>The policeman was so amazed at this sudden dispersion of the servants, that for a minute or two he stood like a post, only saying,—"Hilloa! hilloa!" But not for long was he left to his own conjectures, for in a moment the cause of the sudden fright of the servants presented itself in the shape of the murderer coolly descending the grand staircase into the hall. It was quite evident that he must have been hidden in the boudoir when it was broken open.</p>
               <p>"You are my prisoner!" cried the policeman making a dark forward, and rolling headlong over the porter.</p>
               <p>The interruption thus given to the policeman was sufficient to enable the maniac, with a wild shout of rage and defiance, to bound past him, and clearing the door steps in a moment he was in Chesnut street.</p>
               <p>"Woa!" cried the policeman. It was the first word that occurred to him, and then he gave two blows with his club to warn his brother officer that the person "wanted" was in the front instead of the back of the house, he then dashed after the fugitive with no lack of courage, wild and desperate as that fugitive seemed to be, by the transient glance he had caught of him.</p>
               <p>It was not a time of the night for many persons to be in the way to interrupt either the policeman or the maniac, who urged his flight after one or two doublings, towards Elizabeth street; but there was one advantage which the pursuers had in consequence of the deserted state of the streets, and that was that they could keep their game in sight.</p>
               <p>Now and then the policeman paused to give two or three blows with his club, and then on he would go again; and the other officer who had made his way through the secret-panelled door in the chamber of the lady, was not far off.</p>
               <p>As they entered Elizabeth Street, some one made an attempt to stop the desperate, flying man, but his strength, or the impetus with which he was proceeding, was so great, that the adventurous individual was rolled headlong into the roadway, and the murderer still pursued his course.</p>
               <p>And now arose the wild cry of—"Stop him! Stop him!" for the officers were afraid that in the intricacies of the streets, they might lose sight of the fugitive. Down the first he dashed; and as if with a settled purpose of finding some place of retreat he took his route onward: but Heaven knew that there was no settled purpose in the mind of that poor creature of bewildered impulses. He only fled from a sort of wild instinct, the more because he felt that he was pursued, than from any reasoning that told him he had done a deed that he must answer to his fellow creatures. But the cries of the police were taken up by others; and thus commenced, in the intricacies of the many dingy thoroughfares thereabouts, a man-hunt.</p>
               <p>Several officers, who at the corner of the streets, heard the shouts of the pursuers, made vain efforts to stop the wild looking man, who at such headlong speed made his way, at times upon the pavement, and at times in the roadway; but they did not succeed. He eluded them with a wonderful kind of prescience of what they could do and what they could not, until he got fairly into the only gloomy regions about Elizabeth-street, and then a well-dressed man suddenly pounced upon him from a doorway, and making a grasp at him, cried—</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens, it is Staunton!"</p>
               <p>The pronunciation of this name seemed to stagger the madman for a moment. He reeled back into the roadway—he fell; but he recovered himself in an instant, and with more than human strength, he shock off the hold which the man had of him, and bounded down the first street he came to.</p>
               <p>The man who had tried to stop the murderer was Charles Horton.</p>
               <p>Staggered by the blow which the maniac had given him upon the check, Horton was unable for a few moments to pursue him, but he managed just to keep him in sight; and then as he recovered, he rushed after him with a fleetness only to be equalled by that of the fugitive himself. Before he had proceeded far, he saw the light of a policeman, Horton called loudly—</p>
               <p>"Stop him! Stop him!"</p>
               <p>The policeman made the attempt; but in the next moment, all that could be seen of him was a confused mass of a great coat—a hat—a lantern and a baton, rolling in the roadway.</p>
               <p>"Murder!" said the policeman.</p>
               <p>"Why, that must be Bones," cried Charles Horton.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8050-00000022"/>
               <p>"Bones it is," said the policeman, gathering himself up; "and if some on 'em ain't broke, it's a mercy o' providential providence, it is!"</p>
               <p>"My good fellow, don't you know me?"</p>
               <p>The policeman turned his bull's-eye upon the face of Charles Horton, and then he said—</p>
               <p>"Oh, to be sure, sir. You is the gentleman that gave me the five dollar piece not to see nothing in walnut-street, and I is the policeman that grabs 'em."</p>
               <p>"Exactly. Now, my good fellow, I am extremely anxious to catch that man that just now passed you."</p>
               <p>"Werry good."</p>
               <p>"He has rushed into yonder large house, but I didn't want to make more fuss than enough; so do you just come in carefully after me, and we will, no doubt, find him."</p>
               <p>"Not a doubt on it, sir."</p>
               <p>"Come on."</p>
               <p>"I'm a coming, sir. Lantern rather the <emph>wus</emph> for a roll in the gutter, and one arm of our great coat all in a rip. Well, it's all in the way o' trade. Here I is, Mr. Horton. Anything you please to say, sir. I'm the force as will do it."</p>
               <p>Charles Horton ascended the dingy stairs of the house, followed by Bones; and what occurred when he got to the attic in which Herbert Sinclair lived or rather we might say, half starved, is already known to the reader of this veritable episode of real life in Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>And now as the dim and quiet small hours of the night—the one, the two, and the three—are fading away, we may yet take a brief notice of Clara in that attic, so lately the scene of riot and confusion, as the madman rushed through it on the wild path to death—so lately the scene of grateful remembrance of youthful friendship between Charles Horton and Herbert Sinclair—so lately the scene of hilarity, such as its old, wan, damp walls had not witnessed for many a long, long day.</p>
               <p>Yes, Clara was there; but she was not to be there long. Already the hours were numbered, and the enumeration of them was of slight account during which she was to remain an inmate of that place, which had almost quenched the delicate life of her child, and had really made great inroads upon her own gentle beauty.</p>
               <p>When Herbert left the attic with his old friend, Charles, Clara could not be said to expect him very soon. She was inclined to allow a wide license to his absence. She had heard that Charles Horton was the friend of other years, and she had seen, as she thought—ah, foolish thought—enough of him to believe that he was frank, and generous, and kind, and guileless; so she did not, we say, expect Herbert soon. But she hoped for him soon, although expectation went not with that heart's impulse.</p>
               <p>Foolish Clara! The first thing she did after the departure of Herbert bert and Horton, was to close and secure the attic door, as she always secured it when he was from home. The next thing she did was to sit down and weep. Yes, Clara wept tears of joy that some hope and comfort had come to them at last in their lonely wretchedness. She fancied she saw a bright star beaming through the thick gloom of their drear poverty; and in her innocence of heart, she told herself, that this visit, accidental as it was, or seemed to be, of Herbert's old acquaintance to the attic was one of those dear, pleasant, providential things by which Heaven, by stealth, does good to its creatures in its own happy, gentle way.</p>
               <p>And then she prayed and thanked the great and beneficent ruler of all worlds for such goodness. Poor Clara!</p>
               <p>The child slept, but at the faint sound of its mother's voice during the utterance of the prayer, it opened its large lustrous eyes, and looked up from its little humble cot.</p>
               <p>"Mamma!"</p>
               <p>Oh, what an invocation is that word from the lips of childhood! Clara was kneeling by the little cot—the precious casket that contained her earthly jewel! and with eyes yet glistening with tears, she kissed the little one.</p>
               <p>"Happy, happy," she said, "may the days be that are now in store for you, my own, my beautiful darling of my heart, whom I have loved so well that I have trembled lest some angel, jealous of the mother's joy, should tell the tale of overfond affection in the realms of Heaven, and they should snatch you from me as one too fair and happy to linger on the earth, and be subservient to its uses. My child—my little one, you will be—you shall be very happy in the time to come"</p>
               <p>The little one laughed with the magic glee of childhood—that rare laugh, which, when the sunny time of early life has deepened into the dim autumn of later years, may never again come from the lips of the soiled soul.</p>
               <p>"Yes," she added, "you will and you shall be happy. Ah, what would I not give now to be sure, my darling, that you should achieve wealth, and state, and renown! Thy mother would be proud—so proud to see thee the observed of men, and hear thy name in the mouths of the many. Yes, and it may be."</p>
               <p>The mother's eye lit up with the pure light of glowing hope, and a flush of old color came to the wan check.</p>
               <p>"Time was," she said, "when those who have been the wonders of a nation lay there even as you lie, my little one, in a humble cot, seemingly the sport of every idle wind that may come to sap thy young life. So did a Shakespeare bless a mother's eyes with the smiles of gentleness. Already I feel that a much happier time is coming."</p>
               <p>The child placed its little arms round Clara's neck, and smiled it self to sleep again amid gentle kisses.</p>
               <p>"No," said Clara, "no," as she removed the little arms from<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8050-00000023"/> around her, and covered up the small slumberer against the night air. "No, I would not have thee great, I would not have thee great, I would only have thee good; for the good are happy in the gentle light of their own virtue and serenity, while the great only live in the fitful glare of the regards of others; and the higher the foot of an adventurous mortal climbs, the dizzier grows the brain, and the more absolute is the fall if it should happen. No—no, my own one! I would have the good and happy, not great and with many foes, as the great will have. Hush!"</p>
               <p>The night air howled past the casement.</p>
               <p>Clara rose, and again renewed the brief means that had been used to put to rights until the morning the broken window; and as she looked out she saw that the rain had ceased, and that the stars were peeping forth from out patches of blue sky, which ever and anon the clouds drifted over, as they were chased before the keen blast that had driven away the rain far over the wide ocean.</p>
               <p>Then she began to wish that Herbert would come home; and for the first time an uneasy feeling at his absence crept over her and made her tremble.</p>
               <p>She strove to reason against the feeling; but away as another hour sped away, and then another, and he came not, the vague alarm grew more and more intense, and she tried in vain to stop the wearied beating of her heart. In vain she asked herself what could happen amiss? In vain she strove to tell herself that of course all must be right, because Charles Horton was with Herbert. But in some way, now, the pronunciation of that name did not bring with it much consolation; and in another hour the feeling of anxiety had deepened into absolute alarm, and yet he came not!</p>
               <p>The gray light of the coming dawn began to do battle with the light in the attic. Clara had opened the door, and listened anxiously upon the stairs. He comes!—he comes! No: the footstep she thought was his pauses at a door upon some other floor. It is not he!</p>
               <p>She crept back to the old attic, and kneeling by a chair, she leant her face upon her hands, and prayed again; but he came not!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CONFESSION OF THE ADULTRESS—LIFE'S CHANCES.</head>
               <p>MRS. MORTVILLE still remained upon the floor of the boudoir, a miserable libel upon human grandeur and human pride; for while they thought there was danger attending their doing so, not one of all the number of servants that she kept to do her bidding, attempted to render her the least assistance.</p>
               <p>It was not until they felt quite assured that the wild-looking man was out of the house, that in a body some of them made their way to the boudoir. To the honor then of woman's nature we may record, that it was the females of the household who were foremost, while many a tall, strapping fellow stood trembling upon the staircase, and fearing for his own safety.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mortville's own maid, the young girl whom she had spoken to not very long before the fearful incident which had produced such a world of confusion in that house took place, had the most presence of mind of any. It was she who sent for the nearest doctor, and it was she who first raised her mistress from the floor.</p>
               <p>"Is she dead?" asked half a dozen voices.</p>
               <p>"Dear me, how could it happen?" cried another.</p>
               <p>"Hush!" said the young girl. "I do not think that she is dead."</p>
               <p>Upon this intimation the servant were all hushed as possible, and those who had been most callous and indifferent, now in soft tones began to lament that anything should have happened to so excellent a mistress, and to praise her with so little discretion that if the lady had been able to hear them, the duplicity would have been too apparent to have any effect upon her; but she heard nothing. They might have abused her to her face, or praised her. It was then the same thing to her; and yet she did breathe, as the young girl had said, "a little."</p>
               <p>They placed her upon her bed in an adjoining chamber, and then the physician arrived. He was quite the man for rich circles. He always spoke in a low confidential tone, as though some grand secret was upon his lips, and his tread was like that of some large cat upon an errand to steal cream. There was generally too upon his face a bland smile.</p>
               <p>Dr. Mincer, for that was the physician's name, glided into the room with his usual smile, and then in a soft voice he said—</p>
               <p>"Dear—dear! this is really a—very—My dear Madam, I really—we must not be at all alarmed"</p>
               <p>"The lady, sir, is murdered," said the young girl.</p>
               <p>Now this was the first intimation that Dr. Mincer had had of the nature of the complaint. He had fully expected a hysterical attack, for treating which he was quite famous; but a murder was decidely out of his line always, except in the regular way of practice.</p>
               <p>"Murdered!" he said. "Murdered? How very"—low he was going to say, but he stopped the word upon the tip of his tongue, and said, "uncommon."</p>
               <p>"Pray attend to her, sir."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes. We will. But really in the case of murders, some common surgeon, is the—a—the man. But we will do what we can. Bring a light closer here. Will you be so good as to speak?"</p>
               <p>With this Dr. Mincer bowed, but as the lady was past the grace of such small courtesies, he took nothing by that motion at all; and then, he laid his hand upon her heart, and finding that there was still some action there, he said, in a voice of some alarm—</p>
               <p>"We would really rather have some surgeon. Dear me! here seems to be some physical injury to the neck. Yes, we will have a consultation. The idea of murdering a lady is really a—upon our reputation it is a thing we ought not to contemplate. Murders among common<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8050-00000024"/> mon, low people, of course, will occur; but in this style of life you don't expect them"</p>
               <p>With this, Dr. Mincer tore a leaf from his pocket-book, upon which he wrote the name and address of an eminent surgeon who resided in the immediate neighborhood, and handed it to one of the servants, saying—</p>
               <p>"We will have this gentleman in consultation if you will be so good as to send immediately to him."</p>
               <p>Of course, this was done, and the surgeon in the space of about twenty minutes made his appearance. He was a man of sound intelligence and great professional skill, and without exchanging more than a few words with Dr. Mincer, he proceeded to examine his patient, after which he said—</p>
               <p>"The real physical injury is small, but the shock to the nervous system is tremendous. She must be rallied as quickly as possible, or she will go off. Vitality is very feeble even now."</p>
               <p>At this moment the lady, before Dr. Mincer could make any reply to the surgeon, uttered a loud drawn sigh, and opened her eyes fully. They had been only partially closed before.</p>
               <p>"Are you better, madam?" said the surgeon.</p>
               <p>"Oliver," she said faintly.</p>
               <p>"What does she mean?"</p>
               <p>"Oliver! Oliver!" said Mrs. Mortville again, in moaning accents.</p>
               <p>The surgeon and the physician looked at each other, and then the latter said—</p>
               <p>"We are at a loss to know who Oliver is. Perhaps you will be so obliging as to be just a little more explicit."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" said the surgeon. "Some of the servants can perhaps can tell."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to say, sir, that pshaw is exceedingly unprofessional," said Dr. Mincer.</p>
               <p>"Call it what you please," said the surgeon, "but there is no time to hold a discussion about your dandyisms. The lady has mentioned the name of Oliver. Is there any one of that name in the house?"</p>
               <p>"Not in the house, sir," said the Dutchess's maid, "but a Mr. Oliver was the late master's lawyer, and he has been here this very evening."</p>
               <p>"That, then, must be the man. Madam, do you wish to see Mr. Oliver!"</p>
               <p>"Oliver!—yes—Oliver!" moaned she.</p>
               <p>"Send for him directly," said the surgeon: "and go to the nearest chemist with this prescription. This is evidently a surgical case, Dr. Mincer, so I am sure you will excuse me for prescribing."</p>
               <p>The surgeon made use of such restoratives as were at hand, and Mr. Oliver was sent for. It was fortunate that the private residence of the lawyer was near, where of course, at such an hour as that, he had retired, so that he was found with great expedition. He was at the bedside of Mr. Mortville in the course of half an hour, and by that time the restoratives that had been applied by the surgeon had enabled her to speak faintly, while she was supported in bed. When Mr. Oliver was announced, she looked eagerly to the door, and said faintly,</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes—yes, now, now. I am dying."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to state, Madam," said the surgeon, "that there is no particular symptom which warrants such a supposition."</p>
               <p>"Sir, the dying have a precience of their own condition, which others cannot have. I am dying. I wish you all, as many as can come round me, to listen to my last words. I shall not detain you long, but I must speak and unburthen my soul of its load of guilt. Listen to me, all of you, and remember that this is the declaration of one who will not be long in this world. I shall not see the light of another sun.</p>
               <p>All this was spoken with such difficulty, and with such short, spasmodic gaspings and such shudderings, that the surgeon began to look a little staggered in his opinion, and he whispered to Dr. Mincer—</p>
               <p>"She may go yet from the shock."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Oliver—Mr. Oliver," said Mrs. Mortville. "Where is he?"</p>
               <p>"I am here, Madam."</p>
               <p>She turned and looked the lawyer in the face, and then with a shudder that shook her whole frame, she said—</p>
               <p>"Sir, my time has come. My time has come, now."</p>
               <p>"I hope not, Madam."</p>
               <p>She made an impatient gesture with her hand, as though she would deprecate anything in the way of sympathy from him, and then she spoke again.</p>
               <p>"I am murdered! The hand of Heaven is in the deed, and let all who now hear me know from my lips, confirmed by my fate, that there is a mortal retribution in this world. Before I knew the late Mr. Mortville, I fell from virtue, and my son—for I had one—was the off-spring of shame; I was much deluded and much deceived by a villain. My late husband questioned me nothing of my past life when he made me his wife, and the child, then three years of age, I concealed in a farm house near Camden, with a nurse in whom I could confide. It was a small and weakly creature, for I had suffered much agony of mind before I became a mother."</p>
               <p>Here the lady paused, and bursting into tears, sobbed long and bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Madam," said Mr. Oliver, "you will feel that you are doing some act of justice, and you will be happier after this."</p>
               <p>"Yes," she sobbed, "if Heaven is good and merciful to me not else, sir, for I and this world have nearly done with each other. But listen—Oh, I was much wronged. The villain betrayed me, sirs, by a mock marriage—an old device, and one that I ought not to have yielded to: but when the heart is warm with the flame of passion the reason slumbers."</p>
               <p>She sobbed bitterly again, and then calming herself as best she might, she added—</p>
               <p>"He himself tauntingly declared how I had been deceived and<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8050-00000025"/> then I left him. He cared little for that, as he was tired of the play-thing of his passions, and soon after Mr. Mortville made me what I am; and from that moment my seducer dogged my footsteps, and large sums were by him, from time to time, wrong from me under a threat of a disclosure of the past. That was a threat that shook me, and I gave him all he asked. But I am avenged! For years passed I have had him confined in a private mad-house, and there, by liberal payments, I kept him. To-night he has murdered me!"</p>
               <p>There was a great movement of horror at this disclosure; and the lady took such a violent fit of trembling, that the attendants, by the order of the surgeon, held her in the bed. That, however, passed away, and in a few minutes she was able to speak again.</p>
               <p>I had been twelve months wedded to Mr. Mortville when his son was born. Shortly after that event, my husband's health became so indifferent that he was compelled to proceed to Cuba for some years. During that time, Mr. Mortville's son outgrew mine that was at Camden. While he was thus absent—feeling a love for the little one who, at my death, would be fatherless and motherless—I—I changed the children!"</p>
               <p>An exclamation of surprise arose from the lips of some of the servants; but Mr. Oliver held up his hand and said—</p>
               <p>"Let us have silence! Go on, Madam."</p>
               <p>"I say I changed the children. My husband's son I gave into the charge of the nurse at Camden. She swore to me to keep the secret. I now absolve her from the oath. Her name was Sinclair, and she, as the lad grew up, represented herself to be his aunt, and he took the name of Sinclair. I know not now where he is. He disappeared along with his supposed aunt from my observation some years ago; but, be he where he may, he is the the rightful heir to all Mr. Mortville's property, and the young man named Theodore, now on his way hither, is my natural son, the heir only to my name and my disgrace!"</p>
               <p>The lady paused, and there was a death-like stillness in the chamber. It was broken by Mr. Oliver, who at length said—</p>
               <p>"Madam, have you well weighed the deep importance of your words? Have you considered that they enrich an unknown, and make p beggar and a bastard of one bred a gentleman?"</p>
               <p>"Oh God, yes! But the truth is the truth, and justice must be done. Tell my son, the real heir, that his mother's dying request was that he will be all that a brother ought to be to Theodore. Tell him that I say he ought to surround him with all that can make life pleasurable. Tell him that my blessing is contingent upon, his fulfilling this injunction!"</p>
               <p>"You hear, all of you, this strange story," said Mr. Oliver. "There are witnesses enough to the fact that this narrative has come from the lips of Mrs. Mortville; but as yet it is without proof. Madame, can you think of any mode of legally confirming your words?"</p>
               <p>The lady, with a deep sigh, turned her face from them.</p>
               <p>"Speak, Madame," added Mr. Oliver. "You cannot tell—you cannot imagine what grievous and heart-rending law-suits this statement ment may give rise to. I, for one, do not—cannot, for one half moment doubt its truth; but it is legal proof that we want. Have you any such?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mortville was silent.</p>
               <p>"You leave a great act of justice, Madam, unfinished," said the surgeon, "If you say no more."</p>
               <p>Still silent.</p>
               <p>A sudden thought seemed to strike the surgeon; and placing his hands upon the head of Mrs. Mortville he turned her face round to the light. <emph>It was the face of the dead!"</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Calm and serene, as if in a deep sleep only, were the features; but yet there was that about them which told that the hand of the destroyer was there; and alike was the awful fact manifest to the eye of science as to the most unlearned person present; for the female servants who were in the room, the moment they caught a glance at the face of the lady, shrank back with cries of alarm to the farther end of the apartment.</p>
               <p>"She is dead," said the surgeon.</p>
               <p>"Yes, dead," echoed everybody.</p>
               <p>"We can do no more," said Dr. Mincer. "We have done all that—that art—and science, and—in fact, we can do more." He then executed a bow to the bed upon which lay the dead body of Mrs. Mortville, and with his soft cat like tread he left the apartment and the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver seemed for a few moments perfectly staggered by the suddenness of the death; but recovering himself, he said aloud—</p>
               <p>"Every one here present has heard what has passed, and I think I should but be consulting the interests of the family, and the many persons connected by placing seals, at once, upon all papers and effects until the authorities decide what is to be done. I will; this night, and here in this house, reduce to writing the lady's last words; and all who have heard them shall verify to the correctness of the statement by their signature. It will then be proper to communicate with the police authorities at once."</p>
               <p>"You cannot do better than as you say," replied the surgeon. "I will remain and give you all the assistance in my power in the matter. Does anybody know of the murderer? for such he must be considered, whether the actual injuries or the nervous shock, sustained were the cause of her death."</p>
               <p>All the servants could state in answer to the inquiry was, that the police had had him in full pursuit was they had no means of ascertaining. A deathlike stillness then reigned in the house. The lights were put out one by one—the domestics crept from room to room as though their late mistress only slept, and a hasty footstep might awaken her. The surgeon and Mr. Oliver retired to a small room that, was called the breakfast room, and then with writing materials before them, they proceeded to draw up the statement of the death of Mrs. Mortville, and the more strange relation she had made in her dying moments regarding the supposed heir, and he who was the real claimant.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A LITTLE SURPRISE.</head>
               <p>"THIS," said Mr. Oliver to the surgeon when they were alone. "is about the strangest affair that I ever met with. Did you ever, Dr. Thorne, in the whole course of your practice, encounter anything that may be called its parallel?"</p>
               <p>"Scacrely," replied the surgeon. "Do you think that really any litigation will spring out of this affair to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes A lawyer, you know, always thinks litigation will spring out of whatever it may spring out of; and I am sorry to say that this is a case that may be made much of. Everything, of course, will depend upon the sort of hands that the young man, Theodore, gets into."</p>
               <p>"Ah, then, I can well perceive, sir, that you give entire credence to the statement of the lady."</p>
               <p>"How can you tell that, Dr. Thorne?"</p>
               <p>"Easily, as thus: The young man, Theodore, as you now call him, you would two hours ago have spoken of as the heir. Is it not so?"</p>
               <p>"I admit the allegation, as well as the inference. You would make a sharp practitioner, Dr. Thorne—not using the word sharp, mind me, in any sense but acute."</p>
               <p>"Exactly; I understand you, and I know what is popularly meant by a sharp practitioner, Mr. Oliver; and I know very well that none less deserve the epithet than you do in its popular sense. But I only interrupt you. Pray draw up your narrative, if you please."</p>
               <p>The attorney, with practised expedition, drew up a plain and concise statement of what had taken place in the mansion on that most eventful night, and together with the confession, if it might be so called, of Mrs. Mortville. He folded it up after reading it to the surgeon, saying,</p>
               <p>"In the morning, when all flurry has left the servants, and they are able to speak in calm judgement of what has passed, I will get them to append their signatures to this paper; and now, as the family adviser, I will take upon myself to secure some papers of great importance that I know are in a bureau in this room, and which the late Mr. Mortville often showed me."</p>
               <p>"A bureau in this room?" said the surgeon. "I do no see one, or anything of the sort."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps I ought not to call it a bureau at all, for it is little more than an iron chest."</p>
               <p>"Nor do I see any iron chest," said Dr. Thorne.</p>
               <p>"No; but I will soon show you one. The late Mr. Mortville was rather an eccentric man, and papers that would have been safer with me, or at his bankers, he would have in his own house; and he got me to send workmen privately to construct a place in which to put them, where they would be free from the curiosity of his wife, concerning whom the husband altered his opinion very much after their marriage. You shall see, Dr. Thorne, where he hid his papers. If I mistake not, too, we shall find some sort of will."</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>"But Mr. Mortville has been dead long enough," said the surgeon, "for his last wishes to be carried out."</p>
               <p>"Yes. But I have been so systematically denied, by Mrs. Mortville, anything like access to this house, that I have not been able to get at the papers and other matters, and I had a strict injunction from the late Mr. M. to say nothing to the lady of them. I have been for some time in hopes that she would go out of town, and in that case I should have made the attempt to do what I am now about to do with ease."</p>
               <p>"She has gone out of town now, certainly," said the surgeon.</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8050-00000027"/>
               <p>Mr. Oliver then rose, and taking one of the lights out the candelabrum, that was upon the table, and with which they had been furnished by the servants, he opened a closet in the corner of the room. The only contents of the closet seemed to be a dessert service, of very exquisite china; but from the shelf upon which it stood, Mr. Oliver carefully removed it, and then he slid out the shelf itself. When he had done that, there appeared in the wall behind the shelf a small keyhole, so small that the thickness of the shelf, when in its place, completely hid it.</p>
               <p>"There," said Mr. Oliver. "It is not amiss for a hiding-place, although so little an accident might at any time have discovered it.</p>
               <p>"It is very good indeed. Have you the key?"</p>
               <p>"I have. There were two keys made. One was in possession of the late Duke. The other I have always retained, and I never came to this house without taking care that it should be in my possession. I have such a witness as yourself to the contents of this private receptacle."</p>
               <p>With this, Mr. Oliver produced a very small and exquisitely made key, which he had attached to the guard of his watch. The lock was so good a one, that with the proper key it opened at a touch, while it would have been a matter of no ordinary difficulty to have picked it with the best constructed instruments. The moment the key turned in the lock, a square of about twelve inches each way came down by a hinge from the wall, disclosing a hollow space, capable of containing money, papers, and other small things.</p>
               <p>One of the papers fell to the feet of Mr. Oliver, and upon lifting it, he found that it was addressed to himself.</p>
               <p>"This is in the late Mr. M's handwriting," he said. "I will read it to you, Mr. Thorne, at once."</p>
               <p>"Nay," said Mr. Thorne, "it may be private."</p>
               <p>"No. It can only be about business; and, as I say, I wish to do everything in this affair with sufficient openness, that the jurors who will be the judge of my conduct in it cannot condemn me. For all I know, the courts will ultimately have the settling of the vexatious question that may arise in this family, and you, as a witness to this night's proceedings, will be everything to me."</p>
               <p>"I am quite at your disposal in the matter," said Dr. Thorne. "Pray proceed as your judgment may dictate to you."</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver opened the note, and read as follows:</p>

I now tell you in writing what I never had the courage to tell you in words, and that is, that from much observation and numberless little circumstances which it would be impossible for me to detail, and which, if I could and did relate, would lose their force by the revelation, I am convinced Mrs. M. has upon her mind some very fearful secret that may concern my name when I am gone, and legitimacy of Theodore. It has been the study of my life for some years to find out what this secret was; but she has baffled me. I bequeath it to you, and I call upon you, by all ties that you ever had to me, to try to discover it. I do not think that Theodore has his mother's secret in his keeping; but again I implore you to investigate the matter in some way; and I am,</p>

               <p>"How strangely this note tallies with what has happened to-night!" said Dr. Thorne.</p>
               <p>"It does, indeed," responded the lawyer. "I guessed that it would be so before this letter came into my hands upon the subject. No doubt there have been times when the guilty conscience of the wife would not allow her to carry the calm and serene, and I might say, almost insolent aspect that she commonly wore: and so the husband began to suspect something. Ah, here is a postcript:</p>
               <p>"'N. B.—Mrs. Mortville has a small mahogany box, in which she keeps some letters. They may throw some light upon the subject. I have tried in vain where she hides the box. Only once I surprised her with it open, and then she forcee me from the room with great violence."</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said the lawyer. "I suppose it will be quite fair to have a look for the box now?"</p>
               <p>"Anything of the sort is fair," said Dr. Thorne, "seeing that you have such a licence from the late husband, and that your only object is the right disposition of the property.</p>
               <p>"Just so. What's that?"</p>
               <p>"The hall clock, I take it, striking three."</p>
               <p>After the sound of the clock, there was a pause of some few moments duration, and with the surgeon even, Mr. Oliver knew very well why they so paused. A strange kind of chill seemed to come over the blood of both of them; and as Dr. Thorne took up the poker to stir the fire, he said—</p>
               <p>"This is an unwholesome hour of the morning, Mr. Oliver. The constitution of the atmosphere undergoes, after some hours lapse of sunshine, a great change, and——"</p>
               <p>He was interrupted by a shrill, ear-piercing scream from the upper part of the house. The echoes of the cry seemed to dart into every corner of the brain, and they both stood aghast, looking at each other, until the last faint reverberation of the sound had died away.</p>
               <p>"Great Heaven!" said Mr. Oliver, "what is that?"</p>
               <p>"It is truly horrible!" said the surgeon. "It came from up stairs in the direction of the dead lady's room. It can be no delusion, as we both heard it."</p>
               <p>"Both heard it, indeed. No—no. It is too real!"</p>
               <p>"Then I will not sit here in doubt and dreaming. My profession gives a great blow to all supernatural terrors. Wait for me, Mr. Oliver, and I will go above and discover the cause of this cry."</p>
               <p>"No, I will go with you. I would a thousand times rather go with you."</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8050-00000028"/>
               <p>"Would you? Come on, then."</p>
               <p>Dr. Thorne caught up the candelabrum, and rushed into the hall, followed by Mr. Oliver, who turned the key in the door of the red breakfast room on the outside, and put the key in his pocket. In the hall stood all the servants, who, having heard the cry, had rushed up from the lower part of the house in terror. And after what had already happened in that house, not one of them had the courage to go to bed; and their presence in the hall now, with terror in their looks, was still further evidence, if any at all were wanting, of the fact of the scream being real, and no thing of imagination, upon the part of the surgeon and the attorney.</p>
               <p>"You all heard it?" said Dr. Thorne.</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes—oh, yes," cried every body.</p>
               <p>"Then remain where you are. Mr. Oliver and I will go up stairs and see what it is. Who has any idea of the room or the part of the house where it came from?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Mortville's room!" cried half a dozen voices.</p>
               <p>"Very good. We will go there then. Come along, Mr. Oliver. It is our duty, and we will not shrink from it."</p>
               <p>The terrified servants stood closely packed together in the hall. Some of them carried lights, which shook in their hands, and one or two crept close to the outer door, prepared at a moment's notice to open it and rush into the open air for safety from the supernatural terrors that they now began to believe belonged to that house.</p>
               <p>Dr. Thorne walked up the grand staircase with great deliberation, holding the candelabrum above his head, and keeping his eyes keenly fixed upon the route before him. Mr. Oliver followed about two paces behind him, and he too was alive to every object they saw, and glanced into every corner, and behind every pedestal or statue that they came to on the staircase.</p>
               <p>They reached the corridor, from which opened the lady's room, that room in which she had been left a corse; and then they paused at the door, which had been locked, although the key was left in it.</p>
               <p>"Hold the light, Mr. Oliver," said the surgeon. "I will open the door."</p>
               <p>The lawyer did as he was requested, and the surgeon turned the key in the lock. He then gently laid hold of the handle of the door, and turned it likewise. It was quite clear that he had the door now free of any fastening, for it opened about half an inch, and then it struck against something heavy, that effectually prevented it from opening any further.</p>
               <p>"What on earth can be the meaning of this?" said Mr. Oliver.</p>
               <p>"It is past all comprehension," said the surgeon.</p>
               <p>"It is more than that. It is enough to drive anybody out of their senses, to be the subject of such circumstances. Am I dreaming all this Dr. Thorne, or am I really awake?"</p>
               <p>The surgeon shook a little as he tried the door again, and found that something soft and heavy was against it on the inner side. For a moment he paused and passed his hand across his brow, but it was only for a moment that such an amount of hesitation possessed him, and then exerting a force sufficiently to effectively overcome any obstacle to the opening of the door, he said—</p>
               <p>"I must and will end this."</p>
               <p>The heavy object that had impeded the opening of the door gave way, and Dr. Thorne stepped into the room, crying—</p>
               <p>"The light, Oliver, the light, quick. The light."</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver was instantly by his side, and then, to their mutual astonishment and dismay, they found the dead body of the lady, that had been left covered over with a sheet upon the bed, lying huddled up close to the door. In the dead hand was a key, with the fragment of a piece of white ribbon attached to it.</p>
               <p>So utterly inconsistent with all that could have been expected was this sight, that Dr. Thorne absolutely staggered again, and Oliver was compelled to place the candelabrum upon a table, so completely prostrated in strength was he at the strangeness of what he saw.</p>
               <p>"Good heaven," he said, "tell me some rational mode of escaping from the horrible thoughts that fill my brain! Is this woman mortal, or is she not? Are we from this moment to believe some of the wildest fables of horror connected with the dead, or are we in mercy to find some rational supposition for the mind to rest upon?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Thorne did not immediately reply, but he knelt down by the body, and looked fixedly in the face.</p>
               <p>"Yes," he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, what?" said Mr. Oliver, in a high tone, that betrayed the great excitement of mind under which he was laboring. "Yes, what? I do not understand you, doctor. Go on. Tell me something."</p>
               <p>"Hush! hush! Calm yourself, Mr. Oliver—calm yourself, I beg, and I will rescue you from any supernatural fancies. It is clear to me that when we left the lady for dead she had only fallen into a cataleptic trance, so closely resembling death, that we were all deceived. She has had a moment's recovery, and uttered that one cry which has really heralded her to the grave. During that moment, and in the utterance of that cry, she has moved off the bed, and fallen here."</p>
               <p>"But that key?"</p>
               <p>"It seems to have been round her neck, for here is a fragment of the ribbon still hanging round her, while the other end is attached to the key. Oh! how I blame myself! And yet she would not now be as she is if anything could have restored her. It was death that held her in its icy grasp—that grasp which has only been relaxed for a moment. Hold me the light!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver, but half convinced by what the surgeon had said, held him the light, while he hastily with a lancet he took from his pocket, opened an artery. But one thick drop of blood slowly oozed forth.</p>
               <p>"She is gone!" he said. "This is no trance. The guilty spirit has really fled now!"</p>
               <p>"You are sure?"</p>
               <p>"Quite. Help me to place her on the bed. Oh, well—I forgot, of course, you are repugnant to the task. I will manage by myself.<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8050-00000029"/> There she is. Rest in Peace! If your life has been one of wild and stormy passions, your death has not been among the least remarkable that I have witnessed. In all my practice, I never knew but of one case at all resembling this, and then there was only a slight convulsion some time after death was supposed to have fairly taken place."</p>
               <p>"But this has been more than that," said the lawyer.</p>
               <p>"It has; but from the same train of causes, no doubt. Here is the key, Mr. Oliver, that she had in her hand; and do you know, it strikes me very forcibly that it must belong to that same mahogany box which Mr. Mortville speaks of in his letter to you."</p>
               <p>"It may; but where is the box?"</p>
               <p>"That is the question, certainly. Yet in the house, somewhere, I should say it certainly is, for an attempt to reach that box must have been the last dim pervading principle that went out with the latest spark of life in Mrs. Mortville. Come, you are better now than you were. Your color has come back again, Mr. Oliver."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said the lawyer, drawing a very long breath. "Each moment now I recover; and the probability of your hypothesis regarding the resuscitation of the lady assumes a greater air of truthfulness; but I shall never forget this night."</p>
               <p>"Nor I."</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver took the key, and as he looked at it he said, gravely—</p>
               <p>"The mahogany box is not in this room. It is quite evident that, feeble and bewildered as may have been the perceptions of the lady when she rose as one from the dead, that her effort had been to leave the room with this key in her hand. Her boudoir, from whence the servants conducted her to this chamber, is only three steps across the corridor; and it seems to me that it was there that she wished to go in that last effort of existence, which ended almost as it began."</p>
               <p>"That seems probable enough," said Dr. Thorne. "Let us go there at once. Who knows but that, in looking about you, something may strike you that may be a clue to the hiding-place of the box? Come, my friend. We may safely now leave this poor relict of proud humanity to its long sleep."</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver could not but shudder now, as he took his last look at the deceased lady before leaving the room. The surgeon locked the door again, and they crossed the corridor into the little boudoir, but all their search was in vain. Not the smallest vestige of anything resembling the mahogany box could be found; and, indeed, in that boudoir there seemed to be no hiding place, so that their search was ineffectual.</p>
               <p>A loud knocking at the street door took them rapidly down stairs. It was the police come to say how the supposed murderer had perished, by falling over the parapet of a house; and then, at the suggestion of Mr. Oliver, a couple of officers remained in the house in charge of the dead body, and the large property, in all sorts of miscellaneous items, that lay strewn about that gorgeous mansion.</p>
               <p>The faint light of day streaked the eastern sky, and that night of many terrors had an end.</p>

               <head type="sub">RETURNS TO HERBERT SINCLAIR AND HIS FORTUNES.</head>
               <p>CIRCUMSTANCES of moment occurring at the house of Mrs. Mortville, and which we have felt compelled to detail at some length, have reluctantly induced us to leave Herbert Sinclair in the house of Charles Horton.</p>
               <p>It will be remembered that after swallowing an opiate that the arch demon gave him, poor Herbert resigned himself to sleep upon a couch in the room to which he had been led by Horton, after the horrid deed that, in a moment of frenzy, when he was certainly not himself, he had been induced to commit upon the wharf.</p>
               <p>Before seeking any repose himself, Charles Horton wrote the following brief note to Mrs. Sinclair, which he entrusted to a messenger to deliver, although it did not reach her until the sun had been some time in the heavens:—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Horton presents his compliments to Mrs. Sinclair, and begs to say that Mr. Sinclair will be home in a few hours, in good health and spirits."</p>
               <p>After this, which was not done by any means to save Clara a pang, but to prevent her from taking any energetic steps to find out where Herbert was, which, by some accident, might have ended in the discovery of the gaming-house transaction, and the still more appalling one upon the wharf, Horton himself lay down to rest; and with that strange facility, which must be constitutional, inasmuch as it is frequently possessed by those to whom one would suppose guilty conscience would say—"Sleep no more," he dropped off into a deep slumber in a few moments. It seemed like sleep at will, it was so rapid a change from all the activity of waking existence to the calmness of repose. Upon the chimney-piece of the room in which Charles Horton took his rest was a small alarm clock, and at an early hour it rang out its shrill call, and he opened his eyes.</p>
               <p>"So soon," he said; and then the little clock struck six. That, at the season of the year, was an early hour, for the summer was only coming, and as yet the skirts of old winter swept the spring sky Charles Horton rose, and proceeded to the next room, which was that in which he had left Herbert. As he went he muttered to himself—</p>
               <p>"He should now awaken. The dose was a light one, and will leave the intellect clear enough."</p>
               <p>Herbert still slept; but at a touch from Horton, he started awake, crying in a voice of terror—</p>
               <p>"No—no! Help! It was not I that did it."</p>
               <p>"Did what?" said Charles Horton, as he stood by the side of the couch, and folded his arms across his breast. "Did what? How far does your recollection serve you, Herbert Sinclair, concerning the events of the last twelve hours? Speak freely now. I only am here to listen. Go on."</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8050-00000030"/>
               <p>Herbert's lips parted; but for some moments he did not speak. Then he shuddered from head to foot, and in a low voice he said—</p>
               <p>"Thank God, it is only a dream!"</p>
               <p>"What is only a dream?"</p>
               <p>"A confused mass of images—I know not what. And yet—how came I here? This place.—You too.—God! do not let me achieve distraction, if it be not real!"</p>
               <p>He pressed his hands upon his face, and while he did so, Charles Horton stepped forward until his lips were close to the other's ear, and then he said—</p>
               <p>"Murder!"</p>
               <p>A yell of agony burst from the lips of Herbert, and he sprang to his feet, confronting his destroyer—for was not that man his destroyer—with such a look as might have appalled a fiend, and made him shrink from the unholy work of mortal or immortal ruin he had so frightfully begun.</p>
               <p>"Speak!" cried Herbert—"but not yet. When I have done, tell me who and what you are, and for what frightful purpose you have come to ensnare my soul. Am I a thing accursed alike of God and man? Am I a murderer? Speak. I would wring from the profane depth of your guilty heart the truth. Tell me, and at once blast my better manhood by the truth, if I am that monster; but if I am not, I will kneel and bless you, Charles Horton. Yes, I will kneel and bless you. Speak to me—oh, speak to me, for the very air around me is full of horrors!"</p>
               <p>"Have you done?"</p>
               <p>Herbert sunk back upon the couch with a groan.</p>
               <p>"Well," replied Charles Horton, "you seem still to doubt if the events of last night be real or not; and it is my duty, as much as it is my intention, to convince you that they were real. The doubt only for one moment could be engendered by a disordered fancy; but there is a proof of the reality."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, he placed in Herbert's hand bank bills for five thousand dollars. Poor Herbert recoiled from it as he would have done from the touch of some loathsome reptile, and in a moment he felt that all his worst fears were true. He was a murderer, and for gold, too. He had dipped his hands in blood, and there was the price of his infamy!</p>
               <p>"A bold act," added Charles Horton, "was committed by you last night, and here are the results. Wealth comparatively with your former condition. You can now revel in your enjoyment. No more will the chill grasp of poverty rest upon your wife and child. You have nothing to do but to be happy now, Herbert Sinclair.</p>
               <p>"Happy?" said poor Herbert as he held up his hands. "Happy!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, happy. You only wanted money to make you happy, and there it is. Do you know the value of the bill you have let drop to your feet?"</p>
               <p>"No! I cannot see it, for the blood that is upon it."</p>
               <p>"Blood upon it?" Charles Horton hastily picked up the note, and held it between his eyes and the light. "Pho! There is some delusion. There is no blood here."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Herbert, "there is blood wherever I look now,—upon all things I seem to see it. It floats in the air I breathe. It rests upon my hands—my clothes. I see it in great spots let me turn which way I will. Oh, merciful Heaven! why was I created to be such a wretch as I am now? Is there no lightning to flash into my heart at once, and end this life of misery?"</p>
               <p>He flung himself upon the couch on his face, and continued for a few moments silent. Charles Horton did not want to lose his victim, so he now felt that his part was to soothe and gloss over the deed that had been done, and he certainly adopted the most subtle mode that could be conceived of acting upon the mind of Herbert Sinclair.</p>
               <p>"Herbert," he said, "it may be that I as deeply regret as you do, that the scuffle took place upon the wharf, for after all it was but an excited scuffle which terminated in a death. Nay, hear me out. Do not groan in that way. There is one proposition that we may, in our reasoning upon this subject, start from, and that is, the act is done, and cannot by any mortal means be undone. Do you hear me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Oh, yes!"</p>
               <p>"Well. You have a wife and child."</p>
               <p>"Oh, heaven!"</p>
               <p>"A wife and child, I say. Now, if you had no such ties, it would not by any means be so important for you to keep the transaction of last night a secret. You might even if you were so disposed die the death of a murderer, rather than continue to live in such a dismal fear of mind as you now suffer from. But, Herbert Sinclair—but, as I say, you have a wife, whose mind might give way under such a shock; and a maniac, she might live to curse those whom she once loved best——"</p>
               <p>"Oh, peace—peace!"</p>
               <p>"You have a child, to whom the disgrace of his father's life and his father's death would cling while he breathed the breath of life. Do you understand me?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, too well—too well! Charles, dare you tell me that it bears any other complexion than that fearful one?"</p>
               <p>"I dare and do. Murder it is in the eyes of the law, and in the apprehension of all who might speak of it; but we know that, after all, it was but deed done in a moment of excitement. The secret lies in three breasts only."</p>
               <p>"Three breasts?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; one is cold, and still, and low at the bottom of the river. The other two consist of yourself and myself. How safe you are if you are only prudent; and your wife and child may never know—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, name them not—name them not! Tell me—oh, tell me, Charles, if you would keep the secret were I to die—by my own hand I mean?"</p>
               <p>"In honest truth then I would not; and so I warn you that any attempt to escape your present feelings by flying to death as a refuge<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8050-00000031"/> will only have the effect of heaping infamy upon your name, and of letting those know of your guilt whom you would fain keep in ignorance of it. Your wife and child, I mean."</p>
               <p>Herbert shook his head and moaned.</p>
               <p>"I dare not live—I dare not die! Oh, evil, evil fate! But you, Charles—you are guilty with me, and yet I see you calm and unmoved. How is this? Who shall say that you had not your share in the deed? Nay, are there not many who would heap up all the guilt upon your shoulders? Speak to me, fiend. Why and how is it that you are calm and collected with all your double guilt, while I am torn and distracted by a thousand alarms?"</p>
               <p>"What double guilt is that you talk of Herbert?"</p>
               <p>"You tempted me, and you murdered him!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Ay, indeed! Charles Horton. My intellect is coming back, and I do now begin to see things in a clearer light. Horton you are a most desperate and consummate villain, and be assured that if ever the light of truth is let in upon the events of last night, you shall suffer. I will drag you down the same precipice, whose unknown terrors may engulph me. It is said that 'Murder will out!' and if it does, let you be hidden were you may, I will find you, and hold you up to suffer your share of the penalties of guilt. If I am one who, for the act of last night, may be condemned of Heaven, you are doubly so; and there is not an angel in all the pitying host that will dare to lift a voice in pity for thee."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, arch villain! Destroyer of me and mine. Indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Am I to construe all this rant into a threat?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, a most full and abundant threat. It is time to threaten."</p>
               <p>A flush of color came upon the pale cheeks of Charles Horton, and then it faded away, leaving his very lips colorless. His eyes seemed to dilate as he spoke—</p>
               <p>"Herbert Sinclair, tempted or not tempted, you have done a murder. The secret of that deed is in my breast. I can, from some place of security far off, easily denounce you. Remember that to me, if you walk, and sleep, and talk benceforth in security, you will owe deep obligation. I will not not now discuss the question with you whether or not you might succeed in confounding me with your guilt. I think the contrary; for I am not without some dear friends who cannot very well spare me, and who would conveniently recollect that I was passing a jolly hour with them at the time you did the murder upon the wharf. Do you understand me? I tell you, Herbert, that if this affair should eventuate in an encounter of wits, believe me, you alone would suffer. But come—you spoke in anger—we are friends."</p>
               <p>"Friends? Never!"</p>
               <p>"Nay, mutual interest now binds us to each other. We must be friends. Take your money, and think little of the past. A glorious career is still before you. You are young, and have rare tastes. This is idle talking between you and me, after all that has take place. I say, Herbert Sinclair, friends or foes we must be."</p>
               <p>"Foes, then, be it, Charles Horton; of all men in the great world, I will henceforth avoid you. Oh, I should have remembered that even in your school days that you were cool, and crafty, and unscrupulous; but I am only too forgetful of such things; and when I looked upon your face, it was only some faint ideas of your better nature that came across me. But henceforth let us be strangers to each other. I do begin to feel that I must live. I shall drag on, perchance, a weary life; but I could not have even my deep repentance blasted by a sight of you."</p>
               <p>"So," said Charles, "it has come to this, has it? Well, we shall see, Sinclair—we shall see. I know you. Now go."</p>
               <p>Herbert moved to the door.</p>
               <p>"Your money," said Charles, presenting the five thousand dollars to him.</p>
               <p>"No—no! Welcome direst want, rather than a fortune got by so unhallowed a process. From my poverty you took me to do a deed my better nature recoils from, and I will not take the price of the iniquity. Follow me not—tempt me not by your presence, or I may chance, as it is said those wretches are apt to do who have once tampered with human life, commit another murder more excusable than the last. Do you understand me?"</p>
               <p>With these words Herbert darted from the house, and after looking about him in the street for some few moments, to endeavor to find out in what part of the town he was, he felt compelled to ask a passenger, and having thus procured the desired information, he rapidly pursued his way to Elizabeth street.</p>
               <p>Charles Horton stood for some minutes in silence, precisely in the attitude in which Sinclair had left him; and then folding his arms across his breast, he paced the room to an fro with uneasy strides. After a time he began to mutter the most frightful curses and maledictions and then burst out with—</p>
               <p>"Have I then really been mistaken in this Sinclair. Where has he mustered the courage of intellect to defy me in such a strain? Have I only made a foe where I thought to have a poor subservient creature, who, having once crossed the line of distinction between crime and innocence, would from very fear pursue any course I pointed out to him? Yes, it seems so—he is not the plastic trembling wretch I thought to find him. Already he draws nice conclusions as to our degrees of guilt, and threatens me—me!"</p>
               <p>With a hoarse wild kind of laugh, Charles paused before a mirror in the apartment, and looked at his own face. He was appalled at the aged, broken down look of it.</p>
               <p>"This will not do," he said; "I must amuse myself a little. This adventure has, at all events, realized a considerable sum, and it is all mine. But I must now never lose sight of Herbert Sinclair—he is in such poverty that he may defy me to take any vengeance upon him that shall sink him lower in the social scale than he actually is! but who knows, but some day fortune may smile upon him, and if she does, and he should ever by any luck chance become wealthy, there will<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8050-00000032"/> come to him the love of life, since he will be able to make it delicious, and with that feeling will come the dread of me! Ha! ha! Herbert Sinclair, I may have you yet, and make such a speculation of you as shall satisfy me for your taunts and your defiance. I shall have you yet."</p>
               <p>Little did Charles Horton suspect that upon that very night just past, events had occurred to place Herbert Sinclair at a height be-beyond all calculation. Oh! what would have been the exultation of the villain who had tempted Herbert to the fearful deed he had, in a moment of madness, committed, could he but then have been aware that a vast fortune was hanging over his victim!"</p>
               <p>The sunlight was shining in at the attic window, when Mrs. Sinclair, with the little one who was born to splendid fortunes, waited the arrival of their best and dearest friend on earth. The note from Charles Horton had at length reached its destination, and it certainly had done something to calm the apprehension of Mrs. Sinclair at the protracted absence of Herbert.</p>
               <p>Yet the note did not explain how or why it was that he was from home so long; and there was a something about its phraseology that grated upon the feelings of Clara, she knew not why. She had prepared from some of the fragments of the overnight's repast a breakfast for the child; and with her sense all acutely bent upon catching the slightest so not of Herbert's return, she strove to calm herself into fearing nothing, and believing that all must be well, since Herbert was with his old friend, Charles Horton.</p>
               <p>"Hush!" she hears a footstep—she flies to the attic door, and strains her gaze over the creaking balustrades. 'Tis he! Yes, 'tis Herbert! She descends the first flight, and clasps her hands in both of his.</p>
               <p>"Herbert, you are returned! You are quite safe—quite—quite—and well, Herbert—you are well?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. Oh, so well."</p>
               <p>"That is a joy. But your head is hot and feverish. Ah, these late hours, and perchance want of rest, do not agree with you. You are happier and better even in this humble home."</p>
               <p>Herbert staggered into the attic, and with bloodshot eyes and quivering lips he glared around him, as he repeated his wife's words—</p>
               <p>"Happier and better in this humble home! Oh, God, yes! a million—million times!"</p>
               <p>Clara was too much terrified by his looks now for some moments to speak. She stood before him with her hands clasped, looking the picture of consternation. Then with a half cry of terror she sprang towards him, and clasped him in her arms.</p>
               <p>"Herbert, you are ill. Indeed you are. I can see it in your eyes. Do not try to deceive me, and say you are not. I know it is kind and affectionate of you to try to do so. But tell me, my Herbert, you are ill? You really are?"</p>
               <p>"A little."</p>
               <p>"Ah, did I not say so? My poor Herbert, you must lie down and rest. We will be so still, I and Harry. We will both watch you as you rest calmly and happily. Why, even the old attic has a cheerful look, Herbert, when you come home to it. It never looked so desk late as it has done for these last six hours. Come, Herbert, you will rest."</p>
               <p>"Rest?" Oh, God!"</p>
               <p>The little child began a walling cry. It saw that something was a miss, although it knew not what.</p>
               <p>"Hush, Harry—hush!" said Clara. "Herbert, speak to me."</p>
               <p>"Of what—of what? I have nothing to speak of. All is well—very well Oh, so well—I am not ill. So the old place looks cheerful you think when I come?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. The spirit of goodness and nobleness of heart comes into it with you, Herbert."</p>
               <p>"With me?"</p>
               <p>"The note came, Herbert. The kind note from your dear friend, Charles Horton."</p>
               <p>"The villain! The arch-fiend! The monster, permitted by a most mysterious providence to crawl his little life beneath the high arch of Heaven! The—the—no—no—what do I say? All is well—well! Why, Clara, how strange you look. You have done nothing. Hush! hush! What is that? Some one on the stairs? No—no! I will look. Not a word! Not a word! Is it a man's step? Tell him I am not here. You know no such person. Let us fly. Hush! I did not do it. Help—help!"</p>
               <p>Clara attered a scream of terror as Herbert fell to the floor in a state of insensibility.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">SHOWS HOW HERBERT SINCLAIR BORE HIS FORTUNES.</head>
               <p>THE night has come again, dim and squally. As the sun sunk upon the city of Philadelphia, a whirling mass of leaden-colored clouds rose up from the horizon, and under their shelter swept an insidious wind that wailed through the streets of the Quaker metropolis. The back window of the wretched attic inhabited by the Sinclairs was but ill-calculated to resist the ravages of the wind, and the insufficient security that had been made of it by Clara, shook and rattled in the blast. The fire in the little grate, that during the brief presence of Charles Horton, on the preceeding evening, had blazed and crackled so freely, was gone. The wretched lamp on the shaking slanting shelf, again shed its sickly rays on the quaint abode.</p>
               <p>The chance of a better state of things had fled, and Herbert, with all the superadded consciousness of frightful guilt, lay upon the wretched apology for a bed in a fitful sleep.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8050-00000033"/>
               <p>Clara knelt by him, covering her ears from the roar of the wind, which was each moment increasing in intensity, and weeping bitterly, for he had passed a day of delirium—it was not all delirium though; and it was only from pure exhaustion that he now slept or seemed to sleep. Poor little Harry had cried himself to rest some hours before; and in some happy infant dream, full of bright and beautiful things, such as angels show to children in their sleep, the little one slumbered sweetly.</p>
               <p>"Not for many minutes did the perturbed spirit of Herbert allow him to remain in one posture: and now as a more than common gust of the awakened wind tore and rattled at the casement, he tossed his arms to and fro, crying—</p>
               <p>"Wine—wine—more wine—give me more wine!"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" sobbed Clara, "it is this ill-timed visit of Mr. Horton that has done all this. Oh, that he had never come! I repined before, but now I think that we were happy then."</p>
               <p>"No—no—I did <emph>not</emph> do it!" said Herbert. "God—no—no—no! Has it sunk? Will it not rise again? The river! the river! Oh, mercy, mercy! Is that poison?—is it poison?"</p>
               <p>"This is too horrible!" said Clara; "I must perforce awaken him."</p>
               <p>Before she could do so, he heaved a deep sigh, and then laid profoundly still. She had hoped that the fever of his mind was passing away, and that for a short time he would be still and quiet. She scarcely dared to draw her breath, and with a faint "hush!" she stilled a gentle murmur from the lips of the sleeping child.</p>
               <p>"He is ill—very ill," she said. "My poor Herbert. The wine he has for so long been unaccustomed to has made this strange riot in his brain. Oh, that he would tell me what this Mr. Horton has said or done to stir his anger so much against him. Herbert says he is a villain! Why, oh, why did he come to us in our wretchedness but to make us more wretched? Alas! my poor Herbert, you breathe heavily, and there is the flush of fever upon your brow. Oh, heaven spare him—spare him for me, and for the little one. We are very, very desolate now, but without him we are, indeed, poor, sad wanderers in the wide world. Herbert must have some medical advice. He may die else. Die! Oh, dreadful word! why did I use it? But what can I do? Heaven can alone help me know. We are bereft of everything. There is surely something that can be changed to some poor sum to pay attendance for him. The skill that would save him must be paid. No—no. We have nothing—nothing—nothing!"</p>
               <p>Her head drooped upon her bosom, and she sobbed bitterly. And yet while she so sobbed she was conscious of a heavy footstep ascending the staircase. It paused at the door of the attic. Without the smallest ceremony, the handle was turned, and a man in his shirt sleeves, with a pipe in his mouth, made his appearance.</p>
               <p>"Hilloa! Missus, is your man in?"</p>
               <p>"Hush! Oh, hush! Mr. Sinclair sleeps."</p>
               <p>"Gammon! I say, gammon. You know what I want: six weeks rent four dollars, and no mistake, or else you clear out in the morning, and I have the sticks, and sticks they is."</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes; go now——"</p>
               <p>"Go? Well I'm sure! That's rich. How mighty fine we is, What a tail our cat has got! Oh, dear me!"</p>
               <p>"Begone, sir. Your presence is insult sufficient."</p>
               <p>"Oh, is it? I ain't as poor as Job, and as proud as Lucifer, not me. I pays my way. I smokes my pipe, and I owes nothink to nobody. Now, mind you, Mrs. What's-yer-name. The werry genteelest thing as you can do, is to pay me my money. If you don't, you start, that's all. I've said my say and there's an end on it. I care for nobody, and pays my way. Oh, I'm a going, Mum. The attractions of this here attic ain't no ways prepossessible. You needn't be a waving of your hand in that'ere kind o' way. I'm a going. I pays my way, and I says my say, that's all, Mum."</p>
               <p>Bang! went the attic-door shut after the retreating landlord of the house, with a noise that at once roused Herbert from his first few moments of quiet sleep. With a sharp cry of terror, he sprang up.</p>
               <p>"What is that?" Help—no—mercy! Oh, what is that?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Herbert. Nothing. I only closed the door too rapidly, that was all. It is nothing, Herbert."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Clara, you should be more gentle."</p>
               <p>She wrung her hands. She was told by him to be more gentle—she who had taken the blame of that harsh closing of the door upon herself, rather than disturb Herbert with the news of the coarse visit than had just been paid to their miserable home.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Herbert," she managed to say, "I will be more gentle."</p>
               <p>"Was I sleeping, Clara?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Herbert. You are better now? Oh, tell me that you are, If only for a moment I could see you smile again?"</p>
               <p>"Smile—again?—God!"</p>
               <p>"Herbert, why do you speak in such a tone as though you were never to smile again? Is there really some secret woe at your heart, superior to all ordinary cares? I dare not think so; but yet your words—"</p>
               <p>"My words? My words? What have I said? What? Tell me, directly, Clara. What have I said? Have you been whispering to me in my sleep, and so got my unwary soul to whisper things that—that—No—no. It is nothing. What am I saying! It is nothing!"</p>
               <p>"You terrify me, Herbert."</p>
               <p>"Hush! hush!"</p>
               <p>He grasped her hand by the wrist, and inclined his head to an attitude of intense listening.</p>
               <p>"Hush! hush!"</p>
               <p>"What do you hear? What is it, Herbert!"</p>
               <p>"They come—they come!"</p>
               <p>"Who come! I hear no one. You are deceived by the moaning of the wind, Herbert. No one comes."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Clara. They are sure to find me out. It is a divine law that they should. They come now. Do ooh hear them now? They are<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8050-00000034"/> on the first flight of stairs—They ask for me, Herbert Sinclair. My senses are preternaturally acute—I hear them—then come—they come! Clara—my own Clara, when I am gone from you, do not think very hardly of me, but ever remember that I loved you tenderly, and—and, Clara—Hold me—oh, keep me from them, Clara. They come. Hide me!—Help!—Hush, oh, hush! It was sure to come to this!"</p>
               <p>He cowered down upon the couch, and shook fearfully. Clara was in a state of the greatest alarm. For the first time the frightful thought came across her, that their sufferings and long privations had, at length, acted sufficiently upon the brain of Herbert to produce madness; and at the moment that the idea found a place in her thoughts, she felt that there was something worse than even death in the horrible supposition. She felt that, for the moment, her own brain reeled.</p>
               <p>In the silence that ensued, however, during the period when this fearful thought crept around the heart of poor Clara, she was able to discern that when Herbert talked of his preternaturally acute senses detecting the approach of some persons, he was correct, for she heard a confused sound of feet upon the staircase, and the murmur of several voices, coming each moment nearer and nearer to the attic.</p>
               <p>She rose in surprise, for she could not conceive what people could be coming there for. A feeling of frightful alarm slowly crept over her, for coupling the fact of the approach of strangers with the incoherent ravings of Herbert, she began to think that he might possibly have been betrayed into the commission of some act inimical to the law. She turned very pale, and stepping a pace or two before him, <emph>she stood confronting the attic-door,</emph> with her hands pressed upon her bosom in the vain hope that by pressure she could still the tumultuous beating of her oppressed heart.</p>
               <p>Nearer and nearer still came the sound of the ascending feet and the sound of the murmuring voices; and then Herbert rose, and in a hissing whisper, he said—</p>
               <p>"Clara—Clara, will you forgive me? Do you think you can forgive me? I am ready—quite ready. It is right."</p>
               <p>The sound of feet paused at the door of the attic, and the murmur of voices, too, then ceased. Then some one gently tapped upon the flimsy panel of the door. Clara nerved herself to speak; and yet she feared she knew not what. Her voice was strange and high, most unlike its usual tone, as she said—</p>
               <p>"Who is there?"</p>
               <p>The tapping upon the panel continued. Whoever so tapped for admission either did not hear her, or did not think proper to answer from the outside; so Clara roused herself, and said—</p>
               <p>"Come in!"</p>
               <p>That was heard, and the door was slowly opened. Some half dozen people appeared in the entrance, the foremost of whom was a little corpulent man. Behind him were several persons, one of whom carried a light.</p>
               <p>"Are these," said the little corpulent man, who seemed rather the worse in his breath, from the ascent of so many stairs. "Are these the apartments of Mr. Herbert Sinclair?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Clara.</p>
               <p>The little man immediately executed a very low bow, almost to the ground, and those who were behind him follow his example.</p>
               <p>"What," said Clara, trembling from head to foot, for she thought to be sure that this homage was some frightful mockery. "What is your pleasure here? Speak at once!"</p>
               <p>"I am here!" cried Herbert, springing forward. "I am here! Take me—I am the man you seek!"</p>
               <p>"No—no," said Clara "Hush! Herbert, am I mad or you? What does it all mean?"</p>
               <p>The little corpulent man advanced two steps into the attic and executed another bow. Then waving his hand in a highly oratorical manner, he said—</p>
               <p>"Allow me to hope for your pardon for this seeming intrusion. My name is Benjamin Traps, attorney at law. I have the honor to be your most obedient servant. Madam, allow me the honor of saying that—that I bow to you, Madam. We all bow—"</p>
               <p>Herbert passed his hand across his brow, and said, faintly—</p>
               <p>"What is this, Clara? Oh, take me away!"</p>
               <p>With more of indignation in her tones than Clara had ever yet found the means of expressing; she now spoke to the persons in the attic.</p>
               <p>"For shame, all of you. Do you call yourselves men, and think it a manly thing thus to make sport of poverty? If Mr. Sinclair were in health, you dared not—"</p>
               <p>"They shall not dare now," cried Herbert, as dashing forward he caught the little corpulent man by the neckcloth, and at once spun him off his feet.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Hold!</emph>" cried a voice; and a very differently looking person to any who were ranged along the wall of the attic, at once dashed into the miserable apartment. "Hold! I suspected this. How dared you come upon this errand, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I—really," said the individual addressed, "I only visited—that is Mr. Oliver, my brother-in-law, sir, you see."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Mr. Oliver, for it was no other than that gentleman.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. You need not spin out any tale upon that subject. I understand it very well. Only four hours ago an individual threw into the house, Mr. Sinclair's address upon an open slip of paper, so that you, in common with all the servants of the-house, became possessed of it; and being cognisant of the lady's confession, thought to make something good of it for yourself"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Herbert Sinclair," said Mr. Oliver, "Will you order these persons out of your apartment? I presume that you are that gentleman?"</p>
               <p>"I am, sir."</p>
               <p>Sinclair was in no mood for much parleying. That Mr. Oliver was a gentleman was sufficiently apparent; so, Sinclair, wretched and half-maddened by all that he had gone through, and by the doubts and perplexities that still beset him, made a rush at the whole party, and cleared them out of the attic in a marvellously short space of time.</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8050-00000035"/>
               <p>The attic door was closed; and then Mr. Oliver, as he slightly bowed, said—</p>
               <p>"Allow me to congratulate you, Mr. Sinclair, upon your accession to the estate of Mr. Mortville, with an annual income of some forty thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>Herbert raised his arms above his head, and then fell flat upon his face on the floor of the attic."</p>

               <head type="sub">THE WIDOW'S PARLOR—THE SEDUCTION—THE QUARREL.</head>
               <p>ONE afternoon a small party of youths, of most genteel and prepossessing manners and appearance—but evidently the <emph>fastest</emph> kind of travellers—were sitting in the cosey parlor of that most cosey of retreats, so admirable managed by the pretty Widow ——, in Sixth street. The landlady herself—by the way—is one of the cosiest specimens of feminine humanity that ever mixed a julep or a gin cocktail.</p>
               <p>The party were enjoying a quiet game of Euchre, in which the landlady, her pretty face wreathed in pleasant smiles, participated.</p>
               <p>A gentleman hurriedly stept into the room, and addressing one of the players, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Silverton, I just saw the young divinity you are continually raving about, turn into Third street—all alone. If you're deuced spry, you may overtake her!"</p>
               <p>"I'd like to go, Oatley," said the youth addressed as Silverton;</p>
               <p>"but I hate to break up the party."</p>
               <p>"Go, Silverton, go!" cried half a dozen voices.</p>
               <p>"Yes,—go, by all means!" cried Oatley. "Where there's a lady in the case, all other things, of course, give place,' you know. 'She's as pretty a piece of flesh as any in Messina!' After her! after her! 'Faint heart never won fair lady,'" continued Oatley, who was a talented young man, attached to the Walnut Street Theatre, and was in the habit of larding his discourse with "shreds and patches" from the play-books. His last words were lost, however, upon Silverton, who had picked up his hat and gloves, and made off in the direction in which Oatley told him his "divinity" had gone.</p>
               <p>We will follow him—leaving the card party in the care of the gay widow, who was both able and willing to make the hours pass pleasantly away.</p>
               <p>When Silverton reached Third Street he soon singled out the fair object of his pursuit from the hundred of other richly dressed ladies who were promenading that beautiful street.</p>
               <p>Silverton passed over to the side of the street opposite to that on which the lady walked, and after proceding a short distance, re-crossed the street, and turning, sauntered slowly back, so that he would meet the person he was in quest off, face to face.</p>
               <p>Fortune—it is said—favors the brave; and in this instance, at least, the adage was true. For, just as Silverton came within a few paces of the young lady, a light wagon—in which sat a couple of men, who had evidently been tapping the "original packages"—drawn by a fiery horse, dashed furiously on the sidewalk and would have knocked down the young lady, had not Silverton sprung forward, and seizing her in his arms leaped with her out of the, way of danger.</p>
               <p>A moment and the horse and vehicle were gone, followed by a loud shouting crowd, and Silverton and the young lady stood alone on the side-walk.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how grateful I am to you, sir. May I enquire your name, that my father may properly express his gratitude that you have saved my life, at hazard of your own."</p>
               <p>"I am amply repaid by the knowledge that I have been of the slightest service to a lady whom I esteem so highly as Miss Mercein."</p>
               <p>"You know me, then, sir," said the young lady, in a tone of surprise</p>
               <p>"I have often met you, and was presumptuous enough to enquire your name, in hopes that I might be able to secure an introduction to you," replied Silverton.</p>
               <p>The young lady regarded Silverton with an expression of pleasure, for he was extremely handsome, and had that peculiar grace of manner and gentle address only found in the choicest of nature's noblemen.</p>
               <p>"But we stand here, Miss Mercein, forgetting that it is the public street," said Silverton. "Will you have the kindness to take my arm," he continued. "For I see that you have not recovered from the agitation occasioned by your recent fright."</p>
               <p>The lady was, in truth, greatly agitated—not by fright, however, so much as by delighted astonishment at finding that she was known to the young gentleman upon whose manly arm her own exquisitely moulded one was laid, at his request.</p>
               <p>"We need not follow them, or listen to their discourse. Suffice it that Silverton so skilfully managed his advantages, that ere they parted Miss Mercein was deeply enamoured of her handsome and eloquent companion, and consented to meet him again on the following day.</p>
               <p>She did so: and interview followed interview, until she was persuaded to meet her lover at a house in Elizabeth street, kept by a lady known as Miss Emma, who Silverton represented to be a relative of his.</p>
               <p>We need not here rehearse the oft-repeated tale</p>
               <p>The lady was fond and confiding—deeply in love too—and was but too easily led into the irreparable fault of those who "love not wisely, but too well."</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8050-00000036"/>
               <p>Some months had passed since their acquaintance commenced, and in Miss Mercein was alone in a luxuriously furnished room in Miss Emma's house.</p>
               <p>The weather was excessively warm and Miss Mercein had thrown off some of her outer garments, and laid herself down upon the bed to rest herself.</p>
               <p>She started up from her reclining posture, on hearing a peculiar tap upon the door, and unbolting it, Silverton entered. He threw his arms around her waist—now, alas, not so delicately tapering as on the day he first made her acquaintance.</p>
               <p>"Release me, sir!" she cried, and her beautiful eyes dilated and and flashed like those of an angry leopardess. "Never again! till I am your lawful wife in the sight of man—as I am already in the sight of God!"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, dearest," said Silverton, as he again endeavored to embrace her.</p>
               <p>Quick as a flash of lightning the lady drew from the loose folds of her dress a sharp poignard.</p>
               <p>"Attempt to lay your hands on me, and this dagger shall enter the heart you have so cruelly trifled with."</p>
               <p>"Why, what on earth ails you?" said Silverton.</p>
               <p>"In a word, Silverton, will you at once fulfil your oft repeated promise. Will you make me your wife. I can no longer conceal the too palpable evidence of my guilt and shame," and as she spoke, the blushing girl glanced her tear-filled eyes upon the increased rotundity of her otherwise sylph-like form.</p>
               <p>"Caroline, the request that you make to me is altogether an impossibility, I am bound hand and foot, Caroline, by circumstances, whose powerful control I cannot disencumber myself of. A time may arrive when I shall be released from thraldom; and trust me, I long for it as much as you. To marry you now would be certain ruin for us both—you can scarcely desire that; you are more generous, I know. Deeply indeed I regret that you should have to suffer; and I have told you that you may command my purse as far as it will go, and I am here to advise with you on the dreadful difficulty that you disclosed to me in the letter which you last night sent. But really, dearest, I must blame you much for writing in so desponding a tone about it. Something we know must be done, some plan hit on, to meet the emergency; but despair is altogether out of place, for if the worst were to happen, and your friends discover all—you would only have to leave a parent for a protector. And does not my Caroline think that I love, her better than even a parent can?"</p>
               <p>"No—Caroline does <emph>not</emph> think so. She knows that you do not."</p>
               <p>"A perfect mistake. None ever loved you with half the intensity that I feel."</p>
               <p>"And yet you coolly consign me to degradation! Behold with what intensity Mr. Silverton loves! Wonderful devotion! My salvation from a life of shame and anguish is in his own hands, and he denies it, I have no right to be sad, certainly not; nor to despair, nor to reproach him, nor to hate him for a faithless betrayer. I ought to smile on him as usual—to listen to, his falsehoods with the same credulity as when their fatal charms were poured into my ear—and I should content myself with flying to deeper guilt, to escape the taunts and miseries of open disgrace among my virtuous friends. And of course you are quite insensible to any pain my fall will give <emph>them.</emph> That is not to be deplored, not taken at all into consideration. Let them suffer—it was their folly to think well of me."</p>
               <p>"No, Caroline, I should never say it was theit folly to have thought well of you; but it certainly would be their folly to think ill of you on account of this. Their folly then would be consummate, and their ignorance too; and the only excuse I could find for them would be, that they were following the fashion of this hypocritical age. Agreement of mind is all that enlightened intellects deem requisite for matrimonial alliance—the rest is priestly imposition. You have been brought up in narrow-minded prejudices, but you are too, intelligent to wear these shackles always."</p>
               <p>"Silverton, I am out of heart with your flattery. It has ceased to charm or persuade me; and I wish that my ears had been stopped with grave-dust before that luckless hour when I heard it first. How little I thought when I first came to this house, what reason I should have to loathe the place. And I do loathe it! because here I meet with you. And this, Silverton, this was the detested spot. Never I thought had my eyes beheld so perfect a man. <emph>Now</emph>—I could pluck them out for my folly. Your conversation—your letters—your verses—oh! nothing was like them. But I was a poor blind dupe—and you an accomplished deceiver! and that is the summary of all."</p>
               <p>"I will allow you to stigmatise me by what hard names you please, and to affect dislike, if doing so will relieve you in any measure."</p>
               <p>"Nothing will relieve me," interrupted Caroline.</p>
               <p>"Now you have recurred to our first meeting," said Silverton, "I am reminded how much I, like you, were misled by first impressions. You seemed so different a character to what I have since found you. I thought you beautiful—but you are not now, whilst you frown on me."</p>
               <p>"I thought you noble in heart—but I find you base."</p>
               <p>"I thought you, Caroline, gentle—but I find you fierce."</p>
               <p>"I though you, Silverton, true, but I find you false."</p>
               <p>"You wrong me in saying so. Had you listened to me, you would have been secure from much that may now harrow up your proud feelings, unless we are able to plan something very skilful."</p>
               <p>"I yielded to you, Silverton, under but one impression, that I was to be made your wife. You know how shamefully you betrayed and deceived me."</p>
               <p>"I plead guilty to a little deception; but Jove laughs at lover's perjuries. And my object really was to marry you."</p>
               <p>"When?"</p>
               <p>"As soon as I should be free."</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8050-00000037"/>
               <p>"Free of what?"</p>
               <p>"That is a secret."</p>
               <p>"Silverton, on your soul, tell me, are you married already?"</p>
               <p>"On my soul, no"</p>
               <p>"Are you bound by any engagement to any other woman?"</p>
               <p>"To none living have I a shade of obligation, save to you, dear Caroline."</p>
               <p>"Then what is this mighty barrier which prevents you, <emph>as you say,</emph> from following the dictates of your heart and conscience?"</p>
               <p>"It is one, Caroline, which must not be disclosed at present. But hope in the future. This delicate finger shall wear a ring of my putting on at some distant day, if you will only trust to me and have patience."</p>
               <p>"I disdain both. Trust you! I would far sooner trust my unprotected person to the river. Have patience! not a grain more—not half a grain. No, Silverton, it is too late to talk to me of patience and trust. You have humbled me—go and triumph in the thought. You have reduced me to the necessity of praying you to wed me. And this was not humiliation enough, but I must be put off with hollow excuses—with a pretended <emph>secret</emph> that you may not reveal, which bars my just claim. What secret, sir, can interfere with justice? Her demand should yield to nothing. It is no favor I beg of you, but justice, bare justice. Make me your wife—I ask no more. I will bind myself to everything else you wish. I desire not your society, your home, your gold, if you have any—I am ignorant whether you have or no, and indifferent too. Will you consent? Stop before you answer. Be not rash." You shall never have another opportunity for deciding."</p>
               <p>"I am decided, Caroline; necessity decides—obligations of which I cannot speak. I have told you the truth—there is a secret connected with me that effectually prevents me from marrying you at present."</p>
               <p>"At present!" echoed Caroline, sarcastically.—"Why not be bold, and say ever? I shall hear that sentence with as much composure as the other, and weep over neither. Well, Silverton, we are come to an understanding at last, such as it is. You abandon me?"</p>
               <p>"Not for worlds! I adore you! and if you had not fled from me in such horror—I should have now proved by my constant tenderness to you, and care for your comfort, how sincere were my intentions."</p>
               <p>"No doubt you would."</p>
               <p>"I should indeed."</p>
               <p>"And you deemed Caroline Mercein would continue with you unmarried?"</p>
               <p>"I thought her philosophical enough to see such a connexion in its true light, not by the narrow veiws of others."</p>
               <p>"You thought rightly, and its true light is one I abhor. A weak passion misled me too far—but it would not mislead me far enough for that."</p>
               <p>"What next is to done, is now the question."</p>
               <p>"Do not trouble yourself Silverton, with striving to answer it. I shall do the best I can—which will be to bury this knife in my breast."</p>
               <p>She flew from him, and would in a moment have executed her rash threat, but he caught her, ere she could put her threat in execution.</p>
               <p>"Are you mad?" in his agitation he asked.</p>
               <p>"Nothing half so sweet! Oh! no, Silverton, not mad—there is no such forgetfulness for the mocked and humbled Caroline! Heaven! send me madness—let me perish—or, living, pluck out memory from one whose agony is the knowledge of what a ruined wretch she is!"</p>
               <p>"You are not leaving me!" he cried.</p>
               <p>"What else should I do, sir? You have effected all you designed with me, now go and delude others—go read, smoke, drink, dance, and laugh—while I go hence and weep, and wither. Oh! to be thus."</p>
               <p>"Remain with me, dear Caroline! You shall be happy, I pledge my honor. We will leave by the steamer to-morrow morning for New-York. You know not what you reject, indeed you do not—I could tell you—"</p>
               <p>"But then your <emph>secret</emph> prevents you," sarcastically interrupted Caroline.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, so it does. Come be mine; fly from the difficulties you anticipate—my arms shall be your shelter from every sorrow. I will surround you with,"—he hesitated—"with joys. Come, come—you shall not refuse me."</p>
               <p>A moment she yielded to fondness, but the next she started from him with a glance that scorched like lightning.</p>
               <p>"Seductive villain! No, a thousand times, No! unalterably, No! I embrace rather all the shames, and miseries, and horrors that I dread. Welcome all of them, rather than you! You are odious to my sight from this hour! Never will I plead to you again as I have done this evening. 'Tis past. I tear you from my soul, however sharp be the agony. Never see my face again, Silverton. If you seek me I will not be found.</p>
               <p>"I am to understand that this is to be a final close to our intimacy?"</p>
               <p>"Final, Silverton, to all eternity. Wed whom you will—when you will. I will be no obstruction."</p>
               <p>"I have already told you, Caroline, that I will wed no woman but yourself."</p>
               <p>"Then you will wed none, for me you certainly will not. Never—no, never, after your deliberate refusal this evening, shall you have it in your power to call Caroline Mercein your wife."</p>
               <p>"You will revoke that."</p>
               <p>She smiled in stern and resolute disdain.</p>
               <p>"We shall see."</p>
               <p>"Stay, stay, Caroline, I have not heard your plans."</p>
               <p>"Nor shall you. They are immaterial to you."</p>
               <p>"Far from it. I must know what you intend. Do you mean to confide in your brother, as you intimated at our last interview?"</p>
               <p>"Ask me nothing more, Silverton, from me you will know nothing.<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8050-00000038"/> I shall plan, and suffer, and conceal, without your kindness or assistance. Pass on your own way—I go mine. Farewell! Leave me instantly."</p>
               <p>"She has a powerful mind. I hope, I trust I have not lost her!" he exclaimed, as he left the room.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CELLAR IN SOUTHWARK—THE KILLER'S CLUB.</head>
               <p>WE enter a narrow passage which leads to a number of small streets and alleys, forming a low and disreputable neighborhood in the worst part of Southwark. Its physiognomy is made up of decayed houses, tattered windows, ragged inhabitants, and dirty children. Its commerce consists chiefly in the sale of loco-foco matches, bad rum, and spring redishes, although, occasionally, articles possessing more intrinsic value are disposed of within its precincts. Apple women, fish-hawkers, and itinerant tinkers formed the aristocratic portion of its society.</p>
               <p>There is no tumult of trampling horsemen and rolling carriages in this happy neighborhood; no pompous processions call away the eyes of idle apprentices from their work; no gorgeous display of equipages excite the envy of its simple-minded inhabitants; all is primitive, retired, and unaspiring. If Mackerel Jim should happen to envelop his neck in flashy blue scarf, or if Cross-eyed Cary should endeavor to enhance her beauty by twining some red ribbons about her cap, the thing is, in either case, immediately noticed and condemned. It is "coming it too strong for these diggins," and can't, on any account, be tolerated. The days and weeks in this peaceful retirement roll happily and quietly away, varied only by occasional fights, which take place three or four times in the course of the evening or by the sadsome intelligence that Spicey Bill is sent to Moyamensing, or that Lucky Larry has gone on an excursion at the expense of the State to Cherry Hill.</p>
               <p>It was near upon midnight when two men stood together in front of a small, dark-looking house. The moon was hidden behind the clouds—not a star was visible in the sky, the night was black, gloomy and dismal.</p>
               <p>"Are we watched at all, comrade?" asked one of the two men of his companion.</p>
               <p>"Not a single lady or gentleman near, Zichy," replied the person of whom the question was asked.</p>
               <p>"All's right, then, Geoffry," returned the other; "draw your cloak about you, and pull your hat just over your eyes. There, that'll do. Now, I'll give 'em the signal, and mind, if they axes who you are, leave me to answer 'em. Say you're a living mummy, and can't speak. Look out, too, and don't let 'em see that there's anything of the mob-like about you. Show all your fine speeches, and don't attempt to show off, nor seem as if you were any better than the rest of 'em. They hasn't any respect for the mobs, nor the mobs for them, worse luck to 'em. Mind, no speechification, and leave all your business to me. I'll do all that is—Hist! was that not a tread?"</p>
               <p>"It's nothing, Zichy, nothing."</p>
               <p>"Your ears ain't so practised as mine," returned the one who was addressed as Zichy; "I should know a cat's step at twenty yards distant—ay, even if she wore rubber shoes."</p>
               <p>"You're right, Zichy," returned the other, "quite right. There was a step; I heard it myself just now. Let us stand up here in the shadow of this doorway."</p>
               <p>The object of their alarm was merely an old policeman, who, with his baton in his hand, passed down an adjoining lane, and was soon out of sight.</p>
               <p>"Now, then, Geoff, be ready," said the elder of the two men, stepping out from his place of concealment, and kneeling down in front of the house already noticed."</p>
               <p>"All's right, Zichy."</p>
               <p>"Now," and the speaker, applying his lips to a crack in what appeared a wooden shutter beneath the shop window, gave a loud and sharp whistle. After waiting some minutes, and no answer being returned, the signal was repeated.</p>
               <p>"Who's there!" inquired a voice from below.</p>
               <p>Three distinct taps with the finger on the shutter formed the reply to the question. The bolts inside were withdrawn, the shutter removed, and a man appeared beneath, holding a dark lantern in his hand.</p>
               <p>"Is it you, Zichy," was the inquiry of the latter person.</p>
               <p>"Can't you ever open them 'ere sleepy eyes of yours, Opium?" replied, or rather interrogated, the individual addressed.</p>
               <p>"Club's been waiting these two hours," said he of the lantern.</p>
               <p>"They've been wanting you, but had jist given you up for the night. Come along down."</p>
               <p>"Now, do you think yourself some blessed gal, Opium," said Zichy, "that I am to jump off into your arms? Where's the ladder, you drowsy old fool?"</p>
               <p>"Civil words, if you please, Zichy," returned he who was dignified by the sopoforic cognomen of "Opium," as he placed a small ladder against the lower edge of the opening above.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8050-00000039"/>
               <p>"This way, mate, put your foot on the ladder," said Zichy to his companion, who seemed half willing to remain in the street where he was.</p>
               <p>"I say, Zic," observed he who performed the office of porter, "What have you got there—it's a man, isn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Well, drowsy, if the gentleman is a man, what's the harm of that?" was the answer returned.</p>
               <p>"But he ain't one of the club," observed the querulous porter.</p>
               <p>"You've exactly hit it, Opium," said Zichy. "The gen'elman isn't one of the club, but we are extending our circle of family acquaintances. I'll be answerable for his good conduct. Pull down the ladder, and shut to the blinker,"</p>
               <p>The latter command was obeyed, apparently with some reluctance on the part of him to whom it was given. The ladder was removed, and the door closed; but the porter continued to cast sly and suspicious glances at the persons of his two visitors. The three proceeded across a damp, desolate, and gloomy-looking cellar to a door at the farther extremity, which was locked.</p>
               <p>"Where's the young lady, Opium?" asked Zichy, alluding poetically to the idea of the key being the daughter of some fatherly locksmith.</p>
               <p>Opium seemed to hesitate, and did not produce the article in question.</p>
               <p>"Are you gone fast asleep, you drowsy-headed elephant?" cried Zichy. "Give us the key,—d'ye hear?"</p>
               <p>"I do," answered Opium emphatically; not, however, complying with the demand, but casting sharp and scrutinizing looks at the person of his new acquaintance in the cellar.</p>
               <p>"What does the fool mean?" said Zichy, in a passionate voice. "Don't stare at a gen'elman like that. D'ye think he's your friend below come to ask for you, you old sinner? Open the door, I say."</p>
               <p>Opium appeared to fumble in his bosom for the key. His companion waited for some minutes, but no key was produced.</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, you drowsy rascal?" furiously exclaimed Zichy. "Give me the key, or I'll cleave you sleepy skull for you."</p>
               <p>Opium started back as Zichy advanced towards him, and suddenly drawing forth a revolver, presented it at his companion.</p>
               <p>"Zic Simmons," said he, "I have had my doubt, about you. I ain't certain that you're a true member of the club; things are very suspicious. Let this new man of yours show me his face, and tell me his business, and then I'll let you have the key. I ain't sure that you don't mean to betray us."</p>
               <p>"Ass! dolt!" exclaimed Zichy, rushing upon the unsuspecting porter, and wresting the revolver out of his hand. "Now," continued he, "open that door, and lead the way for your life. You know Zic Simmons, and it's little he'd care for making sausage-meat of such lumber as you."</p>
               <p>Thus saying the latter speaker clapped the newly acquired revolver to the ear of its owner, and laid one hand with a firm grasp upon his left arm. The key was soon found, and the door as quickly opened. Opium, with his friend Zic, holding the loaded weapon in his right hand, led the way, and the rear was brought up by the stranger, who, with quick steps, sidelong glances, and his cloak wrapped around him, followed silently behind.</p>
               <p>The door opening from the front cellar, admitted the three individuals into a small room, apparently fitted up as a kitchen; a fire was burning in the grate. Around, in various parts of the room, were plate racks, basins, jugs, and many other articles entering into the particulars of domestic economy. In the middle of the apartment was a massive table, and underneath that a scuttle, filled partly with coals, and partly with bits of wood. Opium, at the command of Zic, removed the scuttle, and then falling upon his knees beneath the table, applied his mouth to a slit in the flooring, and gave a whistle precisely similar to that which was given by Zichy, at the shutter leading into the street. Twice was the whistle repeated, and then a bolt was heard to be suddenly withdrawn beneath. Zichy grasped one of the legs of the table, and twisting it round as one would an augur or gimlet, a sly trap-door was seen to open in the floor, discovering a flight of steps, which led as it appeared into a dark passage below. Into this passage Opium, holding the lantern in his hand, descended; after him followed Zichy, with the revolver still cocked, and then came the stranger. All being down, the trap was slidden to again, the bolt fastened, and the coal-scuttle above, by means of an iron rod affixed to its foot, and passing through a crack beneath the boards, was replaced in its former position.</p>
               <p>The passage in which the trio now stood was narrow and unprovided with any means of receiving light from without. It bore away to the right, and evidently led to an apartment in some other house than the one first entered. A door at its further end obstructed progress onwards. The whistle was repeated, and bolts were again heard to be withdrawn, suddenly the door opened, and the three objects of our notice were ushered into a large apartment, illuminated by a rude kind of chandelier, formed of a hoop suspended from the ceiling by three wires, and around which were stuck a number of dirty-looking and ill-burning candles. At a larger table in the centre of the room sat from eight to ten persons, dressed in various habits, and employed as it seemed in finishing their supper. All rose up as Zichy and his two companions entered.</p>
               <p>"Gen'elman," said Zichy, bowing to the man whose seat was at the head of the table, "I have brought you another gen'elman who is desirous of joing the club. He has already rendered us many little services, and I can recommend him as a very worthy individual."</p>
               <p>"Sit down, comrade," said the man to whom Zichy had especially bowed, addressing himself to the new comer; "when we have finished supper we will attend to the more important and not-to-be-neglected affairs of business. Ezekiel Simmons, your arrival amongst us has been long expected. Be seated, and take some supper."</p>
               <p>The individuals addressed did as they were desired, and the operations of eating and drinking were carried on with the same freedom in which they had been conducted before the interruption.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8050-00000040"/>
               <p>The room, or rather cellar, into which we have now introduced these subjects of our story, was a spacious and gloomy apartment, having the arched roof and bare brick walls of a vault. The floor was without boards, or any other description of covering; although in many places there were secret doors, fastened by concealed springs, which opened into smaller cellars, and other receptacles below. Whatever furniture the apartment possessed was simple and primitive to the extreme degree; barrels served for seats, and a large board, supported upon two old whiskey casks, performed the office of a table. The inmates of the cellar were not less gloomy-looking than the place; most of them wore black dresses, that being the colour least descernible in the dark; some had piecies of crape dependent in front of their hats, and others had pistols, or other weapons, projecting out from beneath the skirts of their garments. On the table, also, by the side of their plates and glasses, lay six-shooters, bowie-knives, and other articles, little beseeming the social board. Supper being now ended, the apparatus for eating was quickly removed, and bottles, glasses, cigars and pipes made their appearance in luxuriant plenty.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, friends, and fellow citizens," said the individual who occupied the first seat at the table, "still it wants an hour to the time appointed for our leaving this. Our bold comrade, Mr. Simmons, has introduced to our notice an in individual who is ambitious of uniting with our honorable society, and sharing alike the emoluments and hazards which pertain to us in the following of our free pursuits. There is sufficient time remaining for the ceremony of election. Is it your will and pleasure that we proceed to business?"</p>
               <p>"It is," was the unanimous reply.</p>
               <p>"Let the candidate be seated opposite to me," said the former speaker. "Young man, the club desire to know your name."</p>
               <p>"My name, sir?" replied the person addressed.</p>
               <p>"Ay, young man, your name. I trust that the request involves no impertinence on the part of the honorable club?"</p>
               <p>"My name, sir," answered the young man hesitatingly, "is——Geoff——"</p>
               <p>"The young gen'elman is rather confused at the sight of so many respectable persons," interposed Mr. Simmons; "his name is—Walter Timbrell."</p>
               <p>"Cannot the young man reply to my questions himself?" said the president. "I desire that you do not interrupt me in my investigations, Mr. Simmons. Candidates must make their own replies. Mr. Timbrell—Mr. Walter Timbrell, I think such is your name?"</p>
               <p>"It is," replied he, whom we shall hereafter distinguish by the same appellation.</p>
               <p>"Write 'Walter Timbrel' down in the book," said the president, speaking to a man who sat at his elbow, and who was provided with pens, ink, and paper. "Mr. Walter Timbrell, the club is anxious to obtain a true statement of the number of years at which you have arrived?"</p>
               <p>"My age is twenty-two."</p>
               <p>"Write down twenty-two," Mr. Silvers," continued the president.</p>
               <p>"And now, Mr. Timbrell—Mr. Walter Timbrell, before submitting you to the ordeal of further inquiry, allow me to explain to you in a few words the nature of the honorable society, a member of which, it appears, you are solicitous to become."</p>
               <p>"Attention all! while the president addresses the candidate," bawled out Mr. Silvers, the clerk. Silence being obtained, the prosy president continued—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Timbrell," said he, "the honorable gentlemen around you constitute the free and respectable body of the 'Killer Club'—the name of which is merely an elegant title invented for the occasion. The objects of the club are threefold; first, to form a retreat for those who have suffered, both in their forms and feelings, from the miseries and ill-chances of the world around; secondly, to provide good employment for all such at are discontented with the low and degrading situations in which the Fates have in their bitterness placed them; and, thirdly, to provide for the temporal wants of well-meaning, but ill-treated men, by drawing, according to discretion, upon the resources of those who are well qualified to become our bankers. Now, it is well known that there are persons who speak uncharitably of the ends that we have in view—nay, there are some who do not hesitate to designate us by the opprobrious title of 'thieves.' But we repel their insults—we deny the vile aspersion. It is the motive which leads to an action that should always be looked to, and, therefore, the attempt to alleviate, by any quiet means, the distresses of our common nature, cannot be regarded by fair and impartial men in any other than an honorable point of view. Mr. Timbrell and gentlemen, your assent to this statement will be demonstrated by your drinking with me to the success of the honorable and respectable society composing, forming, and literally being—the 'Killer Club.'"</p>
               <p>"Success to the Killer Club!" was drunk accordingly, with all the honors.</p>
               <p>"And now" said the president, "will Mr. Walter Timbrell favor the company with an avowal of the motives that have led him to seek the present honorable distinction?"</p>
               <p>"That is a little job which, to save the gen'elman's feelings, your honor, perhaps, will allow me to perform," said Ezekiel Simmons, rising, and offering his services.</p>
               <p>After some little debate, this proposition was agreed to.</p>
               <p>"My friend," began Mr. Simmons, "is the very same gen'elman who, exactly seven years ago, had the kindness to open the door of his ungrateful master's house, and give the gen'elmen of the club admittance. You all recollect the robbery—beg pardon, gen'elman—the appropriation. Well, this is the very identical young gen'elman—he was so then—who agreed with me to give his vote in support of our honorable body, on consideration of a ten dollar bill for services bestowed. It's my opinion, gen'elmen, that the memory of that noble action should not be passed lightly over on the present—that is to say, the present occasion."</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8050-00000041"/>
               <p>"Bravo! three cheers and a bumper for Mr. Walter Timbrell!" was the immediate exclamation of every member of the club."</p>
               <p>"Gen'elmen," Mr. Simmons continued, "this worthy young individual lost his situation through the break-down of the people from whom we borrowed the money. Since then he has lived in very nearly a dozen families, and got his discharge from the last through being accused of unlawfully borrowing his ungrateful governor's snuff box. And, what, gen'elmen, do you think was the real facts of the case? He told his thankless governor, as was, that the box was liable to get spoilt in the damp drawer where it was kept, and so he had removed it to the 'Three Balls,' merely for the sake of the better and drier storage. And this, gen'elmen, was the truth of the case, and yet they had the impudence to say that our honorable friend didn't act right neither in law nor eckity."</p>
               <p>"Pooh!" exclaimed a thin faced young man, who sat on one side of the table, and who had much the appearance of a lawyer's clerk, "Pooh—nonsense!—the case was nothing more than equitable mortgage."</p>
               <p>"And yet," continued Mr. Simmons, "what do you think his barbarous master has done to him?"</p>
               <p>"What?" inquired the president.</p>
               <p>"Turned him adrift, and says he won't give him a character."</p>
               <p>"Horrible!" exclaimed several members of the club. "Three groans for the barbarity of masters; and three cheers for the suffering nature of the persecuted servants!"</p>
               <p>"This being the case, gen'elmen," recommenced Mr. Simmons, "our noble friend is desirous of entering our honorable society, and giving us all the inwallible aid of his genus and most excellent intentions. I don't think, gen'elmen, I need say much more to recommend him. Such a high-spirited individual would, I am sure, do honor to the best sarcles of society."</p>
               <p>"Three cheers for Zeky Simmons, and three more for our new and honorable friend!" exclaimed a member of the club.</p>
               <p>"The commendations bestowed by the worthy Mr. Simmons upon our excellent friend deserve our deepest consideration," remarked the president. "Are you perfectly willing, Mr. Timbrell, to join our honorable body?" inquired he.</p>
               <p>"I am tired of the mean spirit of masters," replied that worthy, "and I long to luxuriate in the happiness of being a free man, and in assisting to carry out the designs of Nature, by promoting an equality in the distribution of riches, and causing such oppressed individuals as ourselves to enjoy a portion of that common bounty which Heaven has alike bestowed upon all."</p>
               <p>"Bravo for Timbrell!" "Bravo for the friend of the oppressed!" and "Bravo for Timbrell and freedom!" resounded thoughout the room.</p>
               <p>We thank you for the expression of such noble sentiments," said the president. "Let the things be brought that we may test Mr. Timbrell's abilities."</p>
               <p>A large box was now lifted up upon the table, the lid of which was secured by two large and powerful locks. On the top was placed a small bed, so suspended that if any sudden jerk were communicated to the box, the bell would immediately ring. A small iron bar, or jemmy, as it is professionally termed, was placed in Mr. Timbrell's hands, and he was told to prise open the lid of the box without causing the bell to ring. This he accomplished to the complete satisfaction of every person present.</p>
               <p>The next experiment consisted in placing a board along upon the floor, on the top of which a handful of small crackers, so made as to explode upon being subjected to a smart pressure, were strewed. Upon these crackers Mr. Timbrell was desired to walk from one end of the board to the other. This feat, also, he accomplished without causing a single explosion to take place.</p>
               <p>Another trial of skill remained. One of the company took off his coat and hung it upon a hook at one side of the room: a handkerchief was placed in the outside pocket, and a straw, dipped in water, was pinned to the tail. Mr. Timbrell was told to wait until he saw the water hanging in a drop at the end of the straw, and then to attempt the withdrawal of the handkerchief without causing the drop to be shaken off the straw. To the surprise even of Mr. Timbrell himself, this test of skill succeeded to perfection—there remained the drop, and in his hand was the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Sufficient proofs of Mr. Timbrell's ability had now been obtained; all that remained to be tested was his courage. Many a bold man would have shrunk from the experiment to which he was next subjected.</p>
               <p>A pistol, loaded and cocked, was fastened to an upright pillar; to the trigger was affixed a stout string, the other end of which was tied around the finger of Mr. Timbrell. The string was not more than nine inches long, and he was told to hold it at arms length, whilst he kept his eye steadily directed for ten minutes to the open end of the barrel. Should his courage fail him, and his hand shake, he well knew that the contents would become lodged in his brain. The ten minutes passed over, and the pistol still remained cocked.</p>
               <p>The last trial still remained to be gone through. It was necessary that the new candidate should prove his dexterity and courage in the use of the sword, by combating for one quarter of an hour with an antagonist selected by the casting of lots. A huge, tall, stout-built fellow, distinguished by the name of the Bully Sampson, proved to be the individual designed by fate for his opponent in this encounter. Both of them threw off their coats and upper garments, and prepared for the engagement by rolling up the shirt sleeves over their elbows. The table was removed, and an open space was soon cleared in the centre of the apartment. By the end of the time appointed, the combat was to be concluded, whether blood had been drawn by either party or not; and wounds, if not very important ones, were not to be considered as pleas for relinquishing the contest previous to the expiration of the alloted time. Swords were measured, and Mr. Timbrell and his opponent<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8050-00000042"/> ponent both proceeded to try the strength and flexibility of their weapons. At a given signal the encounter commenced. Bully Sampson had strength, assurance and skill acquired by long practice on his side; but his unweildy make and corpulent form were qualities decidedly to his disadvantage. Mr. Timbrell, on the other hand, was of a light build, an athletic form, and a nimble bearing, which, together, pretty well made up for his inferiority in point of experience. Close and well contested was the engagement—fierce and terrible were the thrusts and strokes made on both sides. Bully Sampson contented himself with merely parrying the attacks of his nimble assailant, dealing, however, now and then, some heavy and ferocious blows, which it required all Mr. Timbrell's quick-sightedness and agility to evade. Seconds—minutes flew on, and as fast flew the swords of the assailants.</p>
               <p>"Bravo for Bully!" was the exclamation of the lookers on, as some quick thrust was parried, or some blow dealt by the older and more tried hand.</p>
               <p>"Hurrah for Timbrell!" was the cry which resounded throughout the room on the occasion of some feat of skill being performed by the new candidate.</p>
               <p>Finally, at the expiration of the quarter of an hour, the trial was declared to be concluded, and Billy Sampson laid down his weapon, with the hilt covered with blood, which had flowed from a wound in his sword-arm. Mr. Timbrell escaped uninjured.</p>
               <p>"We are proud, Mr. Walter Timbrell, in having the honor of admitting to our society a gentleman so eminently qualified both by nature and art," said the president, addressing the victor.</p>
               <p>"Hurrah for the new member!" was the cry of the room.</p>
               <p>"There is a little ceremony yet to be gone through," continued the president. "Mr. Timbrell, perhaps, can imitate handwriting with an equal degree of skill to that displayed by him in his other performances of this evening.</p>
               <p>"I believe I can lay claim to some small pretensions as a penman," modestly replied Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"Exactly; then, perhaps, you have no objection to copy this signature of mine upon this piece of paper."</p>
               <p>"This paper—your signature! Why, it is a cheque!"</p>
               <p>"It is," replied the president.</p>
               <p>"And to sign it as you wish would be a <emph>forgery!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It would"</p>
               <p>"The devil! But I might be sent to Cherry Hill, at you pleasure, were I to do as you wish me."</p>
               <p>"Such an event would be possible," answered the president.</p>
               <p>"Then, why am I required to do this?" inquired Mr. Timbrell, in great trepidation. "Is it quite necessary, may I ask, that I so commit myself?"</p>
               <p>"Very necessary, Mr. Timbrell."</p>
               <p>"May I know the meaning of such a strange proceeding?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing can be more evident, Mr. Timbrell," replied the president.</p>
               <p>"You desire to join our society and to share in the benefits arising therefrom. What security have we that you will prove true to us? Simply this,—you imitate my signature on that paper in the presence of these gentlemen. Very well! the paper is committed to the safe keeping of the club; and should you at any time attempt anything ungentlemanly, I have only to produce that bit of writing—here are plenty of witnesses—and it would not be a long journey between you and the State prison. You perceive, Mr. Timbrell, how very necessary it is that you should chime in with our ideas upon the subject."</p>
               <p>Mr. Timbrell hesitated.</p>
               <p>"Come, come be an honorable gen'elman," said Mr. Simmons, encouragingly.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Mr. Timbrell, taking the pen in his hand, and dipping it into the ink, "as the proceeding is all among gen'elmen, I suppose I ought not to object—here goes!"</p>
               <p>And, with that resolution, he sat himself down and imitated to perfection the signature of Mr. Rudolpho Biggerton, the worthy president.</p>
               <p>"It's done!" cried he, as he jumped up and flung the paper upon the table—"it's done, and I am a forger!"</p>
               <p>"Not so; you are Mr. Walter Timbrell, member of the honorable society of the 'Killer Club.' All its honors, all its privileges are yours. Mr. Timbrell, the club desires the honor of drinking your health," said the president.</p>
               <p>The glasses were now refilled, and the company again seated themselves around the table. To Mr. Simmons was assigned the task of introducing the new member to his associates; and this he very readily assented to do. He himself was a short, dark-complexioned little man, wearing his hair in long, straight bunches, that hung down on each cheek. He had a croak in his voice, and an air of mock sanctity in his demeanor. Entertaining high notions himself of the profession in which he was engaged, it was his desire to instil similar notions into the minds of other individuals whom he might chance to meet: thus he was over fond of referring to the "honorable club," and the very respectable "gen'elmen" whom he prided himself in accounting as his friends. It was, therefore, with peculiar delight that he now undertook the task, or rather honor, in his estimation—that of making Mr. Walter Timbrell acquainted with the society amongst which it had pleased Providence to place him.</p>
               <p>"Gentleman," cried the President, "the time has arrived. Let us proceed to fulfil the duties of our honorable calling. But before we go, let any member who has spied out anything worth telling now relate what has come under his observation to-day."</p>
               <p>With the quickness of thought every one arose from his seat, the barrels were all piled up, carelessly in one corner of the apartment; the board which formed the table was removed from off the wine casks that had served to support it, and was stood upright against the wall. Pitchers, pipes, tumblers, and all the other paraphernalia of drinking,<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8050-00000043"/> smoking and eating, were removed with all imaginable celerity. Each member of the Killer Club now commenced arraying himself according to a certain model—cloaks and masks and other disguises seemed the order of the night. The dressing being accomplished, Mr. Silvers went towards the upper end of the room, and opening a box that was concealed in the wall, took out a number of revolvers, dark lanterns, crow-bars, and other implements, made use of on certain occasions by the members of the Killer Club; with one or the other of these, each individual was duly provided. Bully Sampson slipped the large crow-bars under his capacious cloak, and Mr. Silvers was seen to put into his pocket several bunches of keys of a very peculiar construction.</p>
               <p>"Are all the honorable members ready?" inquired the president.</p>
               <p>"Ready and waiting," was the answer returned.</p>
               <p>"Down with the lights, then, and open the trap," was the exclamation of the worthy Rudolpho Biggerton. The candles were immediately extinguished, and the chandelier stowed away in a corner reserved for the purpose. One of the company led the way with a lighted lantern in his hand, and after passing through the dark passage, and closing the door firmly after them, the whole of the party emerged into the kitchen above, where the kettle stood upon the hob, though the fire had long been out, and the grate was cold and cheerless. Still proceeding onwards, they passed through the front cellar; and so up the ladder into the street. Mr. Simmons alone remained behind in order to fasten up the shutter, and to remove the ladder to its place of concealment: after doing which, he also departed, but through a different door-way, and soon afterwards joined his companions.</p>
               <p>The night was now far advanced—dark and gloomy, and the rain fell spattering over the stones. Silently, and in accordance with preconcerted arrangements, the members of the Killer Club divided themselves into three parties, each of which were destined to take different streets, yet all were to meet again at the place appointed for the general rendezvous.</p>
               <p>"Remember," said the president, addressing Mr. Timbrell, "this is your first expedition with the Killer Club—to night you will have an opportunity of displaying the metal you are made of. Keep a bold heart in your bosom, and uphold the honor of the society."</p>
               <p>"Never fear, Mr. Timbrell, for that," exclaimed Simmons.</p>
               <p>"Draw your cloaks round you, and walk very quietly," said the president, in a low voice.</p>
               <p>The rain came down faster, the wind blew in gusts along the streets. Only now and then was a solitary policeman seen to pace the streets. The lights in the upper windows of the houses had long since disappeared. The members of the Killer Club wended their way in different small parties, towards the ferry boat which crossed to the Jersey shore. Upon reaching the steamer's deck they scattered about in various parts of the boat, without giving any visible sign of recognition.</p>
               <p>A few moments before the boat started, a carriage, containing two gentlemen, was driven on board. This vehicle at once attracted the notice of the president and his immediate companion, Bully Sampson, for strapped loosely behind it were two large travelling trunks.</p>
               <p>The president dispatched Sampson, by a whispered communication, to secretly inform the other members of the Killer Club to be on the alert, during the confusion attendant on the boat's landing, to loosen the straps and try to gain possessions of the trunks.</p>
               <p>With the intention of keeping his eye on the trunks and seeing what sort of persons occupied the carriage Mr. Biggerton lounged along till he reached a position that commanded a view of the interior of the vehicle, and then leaning against the rail, he lit a cigar, and cooly commenced smoking, never for a moment, however, allowing his gaze to wander from the occupants of the coach.</p>
               <p>Biggerton had not been many moments thus stationed before he observed a person, with his face muffled in a large handkerchief, draw near the carriage, and cast several inquisitive glances into its interior. This individual then commenced pacing backwards and forwards. Biggerton observed that his face was of an ashy paleness, and that whenever he passed the vehicle his eyes flashed and his teeth grated savagely together.</p>
               <p>At first Biggerton suspected that the stranger was bent, like himself, on appropriating the baggage of the travellers to his own use, but after getting a glance at his countenance, convulsed by the workings of the most concentrated hate, he was quickly made easy on that point, and so drew nearer to the carriage—still unnoted by its occupants—to watch the course of events.</p>
               <p>"I don't half like this move," said one of the persons in the carriage. "It looks deucedly like cowardice, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"But reflect for one moment, Silverton. If you remain in the city young Mercein and you will surely come in contact. You must then kill him in your own defence, or you will surely fall a victim to his insane rage. The latter alternative is by no means a pleasant one; and I know you too well to think you would ever bring your mind to contemplate the former."</p>
               <p>"You judge me rightly, doctor. I have already injured that family too deeply, to wish to stain my hands with the blood of Caroline's brother."</p>
               <p>"Then, why not marry her, Silverton. She is a lovely and highly accomplished girl. You acknowledge, too, she was pure as an angel until you became her lover. Her family is most respectable, and if not wealthy, you will soon have sufficient for both."</p>
               <p>"I have reasons, private and weighty ones, Doctor, for not marrying now. Besides, it is well known to all the city—at least to all my acquaintances—that her brother has said he would <emph>make</emph> me wed her. Now, by heavens, I won't be coerced into anything of the kind," said Silverton.</p>
               <p>During this conversation the stranger observed by Biggerton had passed and repassed the carriage several times, but had only heard sufficient of the dialogue to be aware of the subject, not its whole import.</p>
               <p>The horses growing restive, the gentleman whom Silverton had addressed as "Doctor" got out of the carriage, and proceeded to the animals heads in order to quiet them. As he did so, the stranger<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8050-00000044"/> stepped quickly up to the side of the carriage, and presenting a pistol within a few inches of Silverton's breast, said in a hoarse, determined tone:</p>
               <p>"Silverton! Will you wash out my sister's shame, by making her your wife!"</p>
               <p>"Never—by God—will I yield to threats!" said Silverton, firmly.</p>
               <p>"Then die, you heartless seducer!" cried young Mercein fiercely.</p>
               <p>The fatal trigger was touched, and a bullet entered the breast of Silverton, who, as he fell back in the carriage, falteringly gasped:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Caroline—Car—You are aveng—"</p>
               <p>The youth's pallid lips were cold in death ere he could utter the last syllable of his mournful apostrophe.</p>
               <p>Instantly confusion reigned on board the steamboat. The hands rushed on Mercein and seized him, just as the boat reached the dock—and, such is the depravity of human nature, that Biggerton and his companions took advantage of the opportunity given by the disturbance, to escape with the trunks of the travellers.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A FEW REMARKABLE CHANGES.</head>
               <p>THE murdered Mrs. Mortville is in the tomb. Encased in rich woods, softly lapped in silks and velvets, the sad remains of the thing of pride and passion not like any beggar. The corpse of the maniac, who made so great a change, lies beneath a quiet mound in a humble churchyard. <q>
                     <l>"After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver has fairly inducted Herbert into the property of Mortville, which he advises him to retain for the present, until it can be seen how the young man abroad—who has been detained by illness—takes the news of the change in his fortunes. It is evening again.</p>
               <p>In a room of the country seat in Jersey, formerly occupied by Mrs. Mortville,—who now rests in the tomb,—Herbert sits, and it is worth while to take a long look at his face now. A few moments only had clapsed—but to look upon that pale, haggard countenance, one would suppose, indeed, that years of care and suffering had conspired to give the stamp of the passing agony upon it. The paleness of his face was a kind of special paleness, which may not be described. His eyes seemed to be enlarged, and to have about them a most unnatural lustre. Every moment or two there was a nervous twitching of the muscles of the mouth, as though he intended to say something, and then left the words unspoken, from secret dread of them and their consequences. The slightest sound, too, would act like an alarum bell upon his heart, and he would start up with looks of terror and affright. In person he was thin, to the very verge of actual emaciation. His hands had that sad transparent look which great debility alone can give to them; and take him for all in all, a more melancholy looking man than he could scarcely have been found.</p>
               <p>But he was a rich man, the absolute owner of more wealth than his utmost desires could dissipate.</p>
               <p>He held a book and appeared to read, but his eyes were only upon the page when he thought his wife was regarding him. And she, too, looked much older than she had done a month previously, although the expression upon her face was so widely different to that upon Herbert's. She sat upon a couch removed from the window, which was partially open, although shielded from the rays of the setting sun by an outer blind; and when she thought he did not notice her, she fixed her regards upon him, and tears gathered in her eyes as she noted the sad change that had ensued.</p>
               <p>Yes, agony was upon the brow of Herbert Sinclair with all his thousands of dollars, and tears were in the bright eyes of his wife with all her silks—her satins—her diamonds—her equipages, and subservient attendants. But the mental pangs of Herbert were actual; those of Clara were but sympathetic</p>
               <p>Some faint noise made him start and drop his book. He placed his hand upon his heart, and looked wildly around him.</p>
               <p>"What was it? What was it? Oh, nothing—nothing."</p>
               <p>Clara dashed the tears from her eyes, and, advancing towards him, picked up the book; and then sinking upon her knees by his feet, she let her head drop upon his knee, and the long pent-up tide of feeling gave way, and she sobbed long and bitterly. Herbert did not move. He could not, but he looked at her, and she shook as he did so. But he did not weep. The fount of tears in his heart was dry. He could not weep; and now and then his lips moved as they were in the habit of doing, and his hands shook. After a time, and before Clara ceased sobbing, he spoke.</p>
               <p>"What is this?" he said. "What is this? Why, Clara, what can all this mean?"</p>
               <p>The sobs subsided <unclear>into</unclear> low moans, and still her hand rested upon his knees. The <unclear>moans decreased</unclear> to shuddering sighs, and then a term of feeling was for the <unclear>time</unclear> over.</p>
               <p>"What—what is <unclear>it,</unclear> Clara? I vainly ask you what it is that thus affects you? Here you have wealth, and—everything that can and ought to cheer the senses and the feelings; but I see you in tears. Is<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8050-00000045"/> there a wish yet ungratified? Speak, Clara, speak. You do not see me weep"</p>
               <p>"Herbert! Herbert!"</p>
               <p>"Well—well, I hear. Go on, Clara. Are you not the wife of one of the richest men in the Philadelphia?"</p>
               <p>She rose, still shuddering; and while he watched her with his lustrous eyes, she proceeded to the door of the apartment, which she secured, so that no domestic at an inopportune moment might intrude upon them. Then she tottered back to where Herbert sat. It was more tottering than walking; and kneeling again at his feet, she spoke:</p>
               <p>"Herbert, it is now not long, since by one of the strangest freaks of fortune ever heard of, we left poverty, and what we thought, friendless desolation, to be what we now are. From that time, the light of contentment, and even of transient joy, has left your eyes. Your cheeks have fallen, and you shake like a guilty thing at every sound. In your sleep there is no rest—in your waking there is no peace. A spirit of absolute wretchedness pursues you, go where you will!"</p>
               <p>"No, no."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Herbert. It is so. You take no joy in life. The smiles of our little one are no longer pleasant to you. You avoid me, as though I had wronged you; and at every casual sound you start, as though you were hunted by your fellow man. Herbert, the time has come, when I have a right to ask for your confidence. Ah, Herbert, once I had it with your love; but now both fly from me, for there cannot be one without the other. Herbert, tell me why this dreadful change?"</p>
               <p>Herbert made no answer to this solemn adjuration of a woman he had once so tenderly loved; but rising he abruptly quitted the room, leaving Clara on her knees, the picture of despair and desolateness.</p>
               <p>It was midnight—a gloomy and moonless midnight. The wind blew in hollow gusts between the branches of the trees, and sighed in fitful moans as it whirled away down the hill. The rain pattered against the windows, and fell again in large drops upon the pavement of the court below. Every star had forgotten to shine, the very heavens looked dark and dismal as the earth. There were no sounds abroad, except the sighs and roarings of the winds, and in the intervals between, the constant patterings of the rain drops.</p>
               <p>Beneath the back windows of the house, and hardly discernible in the gloom of the night, stood a number of dark figures, enveloped in large cloaks, and apparently engaged in holding some deep conversation.</p>
               <p>"Leave this job to me," said the president. "Have your revolvers ready, and give me the jemmy."</p>
               <p>Bully Sampson gave the crow-bar to the president, who cautiously managed to insert its point between the shutters of one of the lower windows. After some little exertion the bolts began to yield, and the shutters at length flew open.</p>
               <p>"Now," cried he; "steady, boys, and don't make more row than is necessary. Let Silvers go before, and carry the lantern. Search the lower rooms first."</p>
               <p>Agreeably to these instructions, the burglars one by one entered through the opened window. Each, as he stepped inside, put on a pair of list slippers over his boots, and pulled down the crape mask which hitherto he had worn concealed under his hat. Not a sound was heard in the house—every inmate appeared to be quietly and deeply asleep. The president led the way, and the whole party proceeded upwards into the hall, Mr. Silvers carrying the lantern. Bully Sampson here mounted guard, holding a revolver in each hand, and having his bowie-knife ready drawn, in case its use should be required. In order to accommodate the party, in case of flight being a matter of sudden necessity, the hall-door was unbarred, and allowed to remain fastened merely by the latch. Mr. Sampson was ordered to keep on the alert, and should any scuffling take place between his friends and the inmates, to allow of no one passing down the stairs, except a member of his own gang.</p>
               <p>To Opium Dick and Racy Nat was consigned the task of ransacking the apartments on the base and first stories. Tass Smudge was appointed to keep guard on the first landing. The Coffin was deputed to cut the wires of all the bells, and the president, accompanied by Mr. Walter Timbrell, directed his steps to the upper sleeping rooms, in expectation of discovering there a rich and profitable booty.</p>
               <p>"Hark ye, Mr. Timbrell," said the president, "we must mind our feet upon the stairs: the wood is apt to be creaky. Put one foot forward, and don't draw up the other till you have balanced your body on the first. Hist! I think we had better try this room. Don't let the darkey shine too much, and keep the revolvers at hand."</p>
               <p>"D'ye think any of the old uns snoozes here?" asked Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"I should think not," replied the president. "Most likely some of the youngsters are at roost inside. Young uns sleep but lightly, so look out for a bit of a squall; and if they do open their clatter-traps, stop 'em up quickly with your mawleys. Are you ready?"</p>
               <p>"Quite," was Mr. Timbrell's reply.</p>
               <p>"Gently, then—gently."</p>
               <p>The two burglars opened the room door and noiselessly entered.</p>
               <p>A bed was apparent on one side of the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Look at this article," said Mr. Timbrell, pointing to a square, dark-coloured trunk, that was placed at the foot of the bedstead. "Don't you think it would be worth while to examine its contents?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly—well to do so," whispered the president in return. "It seems just arrived from the country; and trunks don't go travelling by themselves. I shouldn't be surprised if we found a skinfull of the heavy, or a packet of flimsies somewhere in it. Open it, Timmy, my friend—open it."</p>
               <p>At the command of his leader, Mr. Timbrell knelt down and endeavoured to display his ingenuity as a locksmith, picking the fastenings of the trunk. He had not, however, completed his operations, before the president called upon him, in a low tone of voice, to desist.</p>
               <p>"See, Timmy," said he, "I've been rummaging the pockets on the chair, and I think I have found the very identical gentleman for this business. Try it."</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8050-00000046"/>
               <p>The president gave Mr. Timbrell a small key, which he had abstracted from the pocket of a coat that hung over a chair-back by the bedside, and Mr. Timbrell applying the same to the lock of the trunk, found the supposition of his friend to be correct; the key fitted—the box opened.</p>
               <p>"What have we here?" exclaimed the president, as he turned over the contents of the box.</p>
               <p>The contents were speedily transferred from the chest of their owner into the capacious bag of Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"Hark ye! don't let any one suspect that we've felt the trunk at all. Lock it, Timmy, and I'll put the key again where I found it."</p>
               <p>"But the coat, president.</p>
               <p>"Back with it, Walter Timbrell, back, as I tell you. Let not a thing appear as if a mouse had run across it.</p>
               <p>With great reluctance, Mr. Timbrell obeyed the command of his leader. There was that about the coat which won his heart, and uncommonly hard indeed did it appear to him to relinquish objects so admired in his eyes and so nearly within his grasp; but he recollected his position in the "society," and, without further objection, replaced the articles in the trunk, and made the lock fast, as before.</p>
               <p>The president was proceeding round the room in quest of other treasures, when his ear suddenly caught the sound of some one moving within the curtains of the bed.</p>
               <p>"Flash the darkey gently withinside of these curtains," said he to Mr. Timbrell, in a quick whisper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Timbrell did as he was desired, and beheld to his surprise, the occupant of the bed sitting up in a listening attitude, apparently just awakened from his sleep.</p>
               <p>"Help—help!" he cried, as he suddenly beheld the dark form of the burglar at the foot of the bedstead.</p>
               <p>"Another syllable, and we send a brace of bullets into your head," said the president, in a rough tone of his voice, as he laid hold of the shoulder of the awakened man, and presented at the same time the muzzle of a pistol at his ear.</p>
               <p>"Help!—murd—"</p>
               <p>"Silence!" said the president, cocking the pistol to its full cock.</p>
               <p>"D'ye hear nothing, man, in the sound of that click that will keep your internal tongue quiet when you're bid to?"</p>
               <p>Hitherto the burglars had kept the light of their lanterns hidden as much as possible, in order that the awakened person might have no opportunity of recognizing in any manner the forms and appearances of his two unwelcome visitants. Suddenly, however, the shade of Mr. Timbrell's lantern chanced to fall back of its own accord, and the light, flashing out through the bull's eye, fell upon the countenance of the individual in bed.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" cried the president, "who have we here?"</p>
               <p>"That voice!" exclaimed the awakened person; "I have heard that voice; and good reason have I for knowing it."</p>
               <p>"Flash the light on us both, comrade."</p>
               <p>Mr. Timbrell did as he was desired, and the occupant of the bed gazed upon the features of the burglar, who stood by his side. He had removed the crape visor from his face.</p>
               <p>"Well, Herbert Sinclair," continued the president, in a taunting manner, "it's strange, isn't it, that we should meet again?"</p>
               <p>"Are you—are you really Charles Hor—?"</p>
               <p>"I am," answered the president, interrupting the asker of the question.</p>
               <p>"And you will not kill me—you do not want to murder me?"</p>
               <p>"Why not?" returned the president.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mercy! mercy! mercy! Forgive me—forgive me! and you shall have money—anything!"</p>
               <p>"Come, this looks well," said the president, jeeringly—" exceedingly well! Herbert Sinclair asking mercy from me. The joke is good—isn't it?"</p>
               <p>"But you will not murder me, Horton? I—I—I—never injured you!"</p>
               <p>"Of course, I never had reason to think so!" returned the president, in a satirical tone of voice.</p>
               <p>"Horton, I swear that I never meant evil towards you."</p>
               <p>"Nor to any one else," observed the president, with a peculiar expression of countenance. "Silence, Herbert Sinclair; I want no oaths—no protestations. It is useless for you to talk nonsense to me, for you know as well as I do that I am not to be gammoned on any subject."</p>
               <p>"But I swear,—"</p>
               <p>"Silence! You know, I say, that none of your lingo will do for me. You little thought, most likely, to see me again, especially by your bedside. But I have not sought for you, Herbert Sinclair—I have not sought for you. I have not intruded on your presence. I might have done so—there was nothing to restrain me. I might have asked you for money; and, had you refused, the mention of the night on the dock would have been enough to—Ha! you tremble, you are pale—frightened! Why, man, can it be possible that a few words like these can blanch your cheek? Up—up! Remember, man, remember!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, mercy—mercy! You will arrest me! You have come to kill me!"</p>
               <p>"Kill you! And his death anywise frightful to you, Herbert Sinclair? <emph>You</emph> should not fear death."</p>
               <p>"For God's sake cease."</p>
               <p>"Silence! I say again, man, I did not know that you were in this house?"</p>
               <p>"Then why are you here,—why are you here?"</p>
               <p>"I will tell you that presently," replied the president. "Timmy," said he, "just hold your revolver to this gentleman's nut whilst I walk down to our friends. Keep him silent. Not a word, Herbert Sinclair, if you value your life."</p>
               <p>Mr. Timbrell laid hold of the collar of Sinclair's night dress with one hand, and, with the other, held the revolver to his ear. The pre-dent stepped gently across the room, opened the door, and descended<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8050-00000047"/> the stairs to the hall, in which he found Bully Sampson still mounted upon guard, his revolvers in his hands, with Opium Dick, Racy Nat, and the Coffin standing around him, and having under their care a well-filled bag of plunder.</p>
               <p>"Off, men!" said the president; "make the best of your way to the cellar; I and Timbrell have a little more business to transact, and we will rejoin you before long. Take all the buzzings you have gleaned, and make as much haste as you can. You've got the wedge, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"All's right," said Racy Nat opening the mouth of the sack and disclosing to view sundry bright pieces of plate that appeared on the top.</p>
               <p>"Away, then, me—away. Timbrell and I haven't done our work yet."</p>
               <p>"But is it safe, governor, to leave you by yourselves?" observed Bully Sampson, as he hesitated to return his pistols to their place in his belt.</p>
               <p>"There's nothing to fear, friend," returned the president; "Timmy and I have got barkers of our own."</p>
               <p>With this assurance of the safety of their leader, the members of the Killer Club took their departure with the booty, and left the president and Mr. Timbrell to follow at their leisure.</p>
               <p>It was while the president was employed in despatching his associates, that Mr. Sinclair took occasion to address a few words to the burglar whose task it was to prevent him from creating any disturbance.</p>
               <p>"Friend," said he, addressing Mr. Timbrell, "do you know that man who has just left the room?"</p>
               <p>"Very like," answered Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"But you are young—you have not known him long?" continued Mr. Sinclair.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not," returned the burglar.</p>
               <p>"What is he?—is he a murderer?" inquired Mr. Sinclair.</p>
               <p>"Mr., he is a gentleman, and a particular friend," was the answer given.</p>
               <p>"How came he in this house?" asked Mr. Sinclair.</p>
               <p>"Business brought us both," replied Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"Business!" ejaculated Sinclair; "what business could have brought either him or you here, except ye came to murder or to rob?"</p>
               <p>"Do we look like fellows of that kidney?" said the burglar, in an interrogative manner.</p>
               <p>Now, what Mr. Sinclair thought of the burglar's question we will not pretend to say; but certainly the pistol in Mr. Timbrell's hand, and the other in his belt, together with the crape over his eyes, and the grimness of his attire, contributed altogether to invest him with an appearance of something not very far short of either of the suppositions entertained and expressed by the inquirer in a preceding question.</p>
               <p>"Listen!" said Sinclair. "If you are as I take you to be, money is what you want, and you wouldn't mind obtaining it by any means?"</p>
               <p>"Exactly so," rejoined Mr. Timbrell; "shouldn't have any particular objections to do your business, provided you gave a good pile."</p>
               <p>"Hear then. I hate that man—your companion. He and I have an old quarrel to settle together. Take my place in the matter, settle all quietly, and you shall have a hundred—a thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"T wouldn't pay," returned Mr. Timbrel; "get more than that by shooting you and burning the house. Could'nt behave unfriendly to one's friends for anything so paltry."</p>
               <p>"Two thousand! three thousand, then!" exclaimed Mr. Sinclair in a suppressed tone of voice.</p>
               <p>"Hark!" said Mr. Timbrell; "he's on the stairs now—hush! be quiet!"</p>
               <p>The door opened slowly, and the president, in a cautious manner, made his entrance.</p>
               <p>"Timmy," said he, "has the gentleman behaved properly?"</p>
               <p>"Couldn't have done better had he tried," was Mr. Timbrell's rejoinder.</p>
               <p>"Hark ye then, Herbert Sinclair," said the president, walking up to the bedside and throwing apart the curtains—"hark ye: it was not my intention to have intruded myself into your company at the present period; but as it has come about, I may as well say a few words to let you know my meaning. Why I am not in prison—Mr. Herbert Sinclair—as you would wish me to be, it is not my present business to inform you. I am here, however much you may be displeased at my proximity. You, too, have seen and recognized me. You guess, perhaps, the object of my own and my friends visit; and before the morning has long broke you will have heard that this house has been entered and plundered. Should you be asked for information upon the subject, doubtless you will inform the police of your surprise in meeting with your old friend. But beware, if this be the case—Beware, Herbert Sinclair, in the hurry of the moment, that you let not the kindness of your heart lead you to mention your old acquaintance. He does not solicit the honor—and he might not be thankful to you for it. You hear me, Herbert Sinclair?"</p>
               <p>"I do, Charles Hor—"</p>
               <p>"Not so; call me, in future, if you please, Mr. Biggerton. You would not wish, I am sure, to call back the memory of old events by mentioning names that have been. Horton,—Charles Horton,—your old acquaintance, Horton, can surely not be at liberty? You, Mr. Sinclair, took care of that!"</p>
               <p>"You have been misinformed Charles Horton—greatly misled; whatever harm has happened to you, has happened without my interference or even desire. I knew not that you had been sent to the State Prison till some time after your conviction."</p>
               <p>"Probably so; Mr. Sinclair's desire was not that things should have fallen out as they have done. It is not in accordance with his interest that I should be a convicted felon, incapable of giving evidence in a court of justice. Here I am, however, despite the good intentions of<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8050-00000048"/> those who would wish my soul in another country. Some have been slightly mistaken in their intentions, haven't they, Mr. Sinclair?"</p>
               <p>"Horton, I never wished to harm you. On my honor, I never designed ill against you!"</p>
               <p>"Silence I say, man! Call me by that name no longer. Do you wish to rouse the devil in my breast—to wake the lion in his lair?"</p>
               <p>"Hor—Mr. Biggerton, I never injured—"</p>
               <p>"Cease, man! Am I ignorant of your wishes—ay, shudder, man, shudder!"</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you, Mr.—Mr.—Biggerton."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, man! have you no recollection?"</p>
               <p>"Of what?"</p>
               <p>"The wharf, man, the wharf. Ha! you shudder!"</p>
               <p>"Horton—Mr. Biggerton!</p>
               <p>"Hush! man, Do not wake the house. Speak what you have to say, but in a low voice."</p>
               <p>"What is it you would have with me, Mr. Biggerton?"</p>
               <p>"The wharf, man! The wharf!" said the president.</p>
               <p>"But I know not—"</p>
               <p>"Silence!"</p>
               <p>It was evident that the remarks made by the burglar bore reference to some terrible circumstances, to which Sinclair feared any allusion should be made. The mention of the "wharf" was not made without producing such effects upon the countenance of Sinclair as plainly showed that it bore allusion to more than he was willing to have known. His face was distorted, and his countenance gave witness to the severe mental workings within, as the burglar proceeded with his inuendoes. Whatever the secrets of either party were, nothing could be more clear than that Herbert Sinclair stood in the least innocent position of the two. It was the burglar by the bedside of the millionaire. It was the murderer quailing beneath the gaze of the housebreaker.</p>
               <p>How awful was it in that still night-time hour, when beauty was sleeping calmly on her couch of pleasantness, and innocence resting quietly on its place of rose leaves, to see two men thus confronting each other, and calling up remembrances to harrow the soul—to see the rich man and the lawless one side by side with each other, and both afraid of having their deeds disclosed to daylight and their fellow men! Oh, guilt! how impotent dost thou make thy victims! how low! how very low is he who has soiled his fingers in the performance of unholy deeds, and who shudders with affright to bear his own dark actions recounted to him by the tongue of another person! The oppressor is ever forging his own chains—the sufferer ever is, and ever will be, in the end, the victor.</p>
               <p>"Hark ye, Herbert Sinclair," resumed the president, "my time is up, and I must be going. In the morning, as I have said, the plunder of this house will be discovered; you dare not refer them to Horton—to Mr. Biggerton."</p>
               <p>"I will not."</p>
               <p>"Nay, man, you dare not!"</p>
               <p>"It shall be as you say, Mr.—Mr. Biggerton."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! Herbert Sinclair, it must be so, and upon this agreement only do I consent to remain silent upon all points. I am a burglar,—a violator of the law, 'tis true; but were you to speak a syllable against the housebreaker, remember things that have been, and consider whether the rich man or the felon would be believed most."</p>
               <p>"Never, Mr. Biggerton, never! I will always be your friend, and I shall be anxious for a conference with you soon, and when I have decided upon time and place, I will communicate with you."</p>
               <p>"Confer, Herbert Sinclair, with a burglar?"</p>
               <p>"With a friend, Mr. Biggerton."</p>
               <p>"Exactly so; friendship has been great on both sides. Well, never mind, Sinclair; it would be very useless for us to quarrel, and so farewell. Mind you, your best way is to go off to sleep, and not give the least alarm; my safety is your own. Ha, ha! it is something to be a burglar's friend. Come, Timmy, my boy, come along; and keep the darkey all right, or else you'll have it flashing under. The doors of some of some of the boozing kens. Adieu, Horton, adieu."</p>
               <p>And so saying, the president left his friend, to find his way again under the blanket as he best might; and drawing his crape again over his face, prepared to descend the stairs. Mr. Timbrell, who had hitherto been employed in keeping guard over Herbert Sinclair's person, and in listening to the foregoing colloquy, followed closely at his leader's heels. They both stood for some moments in a listening attitude upon the landing at the top of the staircase after having closed the chamber door.</p>
               <p>"Hark!" said the president, in a whisper to his companion; I think he is rising already; what can it be for?"</p>
               <p>"I hear him on his pins," returned Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"He is watching, perhaps, our departure at the window," suggested Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"Or he may be dressing himself for a morning's walk," observed, Mr. Timbrell. "It's wonderful if he can get a wink of sleep after such a frightening as you gave him."</p>
               <p>"So, it appears you are known to the gentleman we have just left, eh, president?" They stood outside of the door of Sinclair's room.</p>
               <p>"We are acquaintances—close acquaintances, many years ago, Mr. Timbrell; and time has left us both forget-me-nots, that we may keep each other in remembrance."</p>
               <p>"But he don't seem to relish your company, does he?"</p>
               <p>"How should he, Timmy—the company of housebreakers?"</p>
               <p>"Appropriators, president."</p>
               <p>"Exactly, Timmy; I forgot for the moment."</p>
               <p>"It's something more than that, thought, that troubles the gentleman," continued Mr. Walter Timbrell "It seems you are up to something that he'd rather have no one to recollect."</p>
               <p>"Probably so, Timmy; but as matters stand, he's got a very good memorandum book, that'll keep his accounts safe."</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8050-00000049"/>
               <p>"That alludes to yourself, I suppose, Mr. <emph>Biggerton?</emph>" said Timbrell, laying a particular emphasis on the name of the president.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Timbrell," said his companion, quickly, "You have heard many secrets hinted at this night; you will do well to let them remain as such. Whether my name be Rudolpho Biggerton or not, can be of little moment to you. I am spoken of under various names, and in various manners; but all comes to the same in the end—I am a burglar and a breaker of the laws."</p>
               <p>"Come, president," interposed Mr. Timbrell, "be a little gentle on the honorable club. Things ain't at all the better for being called by their right names."</p>
               <p>"Were they, Walter Timbrell, I might not be known as Mr. Biggerton."</p>
               <p>"But if this gentleman ain't all square with you, wouldn't it be as well to stop him from doing any harm?" observed Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"Silence!" exclaimed the president. "Hark ye, Walter Timbrell, I will have nothing more to do with deeds of blood. Do not name such matters to me. As for this man, his day is coming, one or the other of us will have reason to wish that we had never seen that morning's sun. Rob, Mr. Timbrell, steal,—do what you please, I am as much an enemy to the heavy pursed lumber of the earth as you or others would wish me to be. I hate—I contemn—I despise the laws that give protection to the monied rascals of the world, and shirk from assisting the low and poverty-stricken wretch: that allow the rich man to be honored, though a villain, and the poor to be condemned upon the mere thread of suspicion. Wherever the rich rogue be found, and wherever the purse-proud may think himself secure, there and then will he meet with me as a foe; but I will not shed unnecessary blood, Mr. Timbrell: there is no good reason in that. As it is, I shall wear the hempen necklace one day or other—I shall be hung at last; but I am not a man to be frightened at things that will come about; the like will happen to us all."</p>
               <p>"President! Come, I say, president," interrupted Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"Yes, comrade, the cursed laws will hang every one of us, I say; but what of that? Many a whiter chicken than either you or I have danced to the hempen lady.</p>
               <p>"Now be quiet president," said Mr. Timbrell, in a qualmish manner;</p>
               <p>"your task ain't at all pleasant, and there's nothing reviving in it. I almost fancy that I see Jack Ketch holding out his hand to me in the middle of the road yonder."</p>
               <p>"Afraid, man—you afraid!" retorted the president; "you that spoke only just now of coolly taking a man's life."</p>
               <p>"I'm thinking," said Mr. Timbrell—"I'm thinking, friend, that you've played queerer parts than most of us in your time. I can't say that I very well understand the characters you've represented."</p>
               <p>"Then you show your precious ignorance of stage matters," replied the individual addressed: "whoever did understand the characters till the play was all over? There's the plot, man, and that's more difficult still. You don't understand me, you say, and how should you, considering ering that you havn't seen me play out one part yet? When it's all over, there's a few who will find out to their sorrow that I did'nt play all my parts for nothing, either—you Sinclair, for instance."</p>
               <p>"You must have some dreadful doings with him," remarked Mr. Timbrell.</p>
               <p>"Yes; and I haven't played out all my parts with him yet. There's another actor yet to come upon the stage before the plot's ended, Mr. Timbrell; and then Horton and I will bring all old affairs to a settlement together."</p>
               <p>"I was sorry, President," continued Mr. Timbrell, "That we left any toggery behind us; such togs won't be picked up everyday."</p>
               <p>"No regrets about the plunder, Timmy, my boy; our pals have got enough to pay us for this night's work, and we all come in for our shares."</p>
               <p>"Then, there's that box. It may be full of jewels. You've—"</p>
               <p>"Mark you, man!" cried the president, interrupting Mr. Timbrell, and suddenly grasping him tightly by the arm, "say nothing to the club about the box. It is a booty which I alone lay claim to. It is one of the actors in our play. See, you there, man; as you were with me when we nailed it, there is a skin of heavy for your share, and let nothing be said upon the subject."</p>
               <p>"So saying, the president flung a well-filled purse into the hands of Mr. Timbrell, who briefly nodded thanks, and then, with a look of pleasure, deposited the gift in his pocket.</p>
               <p>"But it's a beautiful box, isn't it?" remarked he, after a pause of a few minutes, his thoughts still running on the elegant appearance of the box.</p>
               <p>"There's more than beauty in it," said the president, in a wild, exulting manner, as he took the box from under his cloak, and gazed at it with a look of savage delight; "there's more than beauty in it, Walter Timbrell—there is a revenge," cried he, as he drew a small dagger from the box which he had taken from Sinclair's room, and contrived to force open. See!"</p>
               <p>"Horrible! It has slain some person, and the blood has never been wiped off."</p>
               <p>"The blood, Mr. Timbrell? Aye, 'tis more than blood! Look at it again, man!"</p>
               <p>"The point is certainly foul"</p>
               <p>"It is foul; and hark ye, upon that foulness hangs our destinies. When that is wiped off—when that is removed, we go also; I and Sinclair—that will finish the plot—that is the winding up of the play!"</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you, president; what have you to do with that knife? Is it yours or his?"</p>
               <p>"It is neither's—it belongs to others."</p>
               <p>"And who are they?"</p>
               <p>"Remembrance and revenge—the knife is theirs."</p>
               <p>"The knife?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Walter Timbrell, this stained knife."</p>
               <p>"Well, president, let's be going."</p>
               <pb n="100-101 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC8050-00000050"/>
               <p>"Yes,—at once."</p>
               <p>"But before we leave, let's see what this room contains," said Timbrell, as he pushed open a door they were passing, and which stood invitingly ajar. At the same moment he flashed the light of his dark lantern into the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Good," exclaimed the president—or Charles Horton, as we shall continue to call him—"there is a supper table all spread out; we may as well take a feed, as we'll get nothing till we reach the city."</p>
               <p>They both entered, closed the door, and noiselessly helped themselves from the abundant, and apparently untouched repast, spread before them.</p>
               <p>"Hand over the bottle, Timbrell," said Horton, pointing to some champagne, "and that goblet, too." Timbrell obeyed.</p>
               <p>Horton struck off the neck by an adroit blow with a carving knife, and filling a goblet drank off nearly its whole foaming contents at a swallow. He then passed the goblet to Timbrell, who re-filled it, <emph>without emptying the drugs,</emph> and drained it to the last drop.</p>
               <p>The two worthies then seized their knives and recommenced a vigorous attack on the eatables.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Charles Horton fell back in his chair, and a 'shriek of fearful agony came from his foaming lips.</p>
               <p>"Great God! what means this—you'll alarm the house," cried Timbrell, and he essayed to rise, but a strange weakness numbed his limbs, and he fell, paralyzed, to the floor</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, shriek after shriek proceeded from both their lips, mingled with the most frightful blasphemies. In a few moments, Herbert Sinclair, his wife, and servants, had all rushed into the apartment. No sooner had Horton's glazing eye fallen upon Herbert Sinclair, than he shrieked out—"Hear me, all of you! that man is a——" The accusation died upon his lips, and the gambler, burglar, and murderer—for such he truly was—lay dead upon the floor. They flew to his companion, but he too had ceased to breathe.</p>
               <p>The cause of this strange and fatal result is soon explained. In the early part of this eventful night, Herbert Sinclair, after parting from his wife, had gone to the dining room, intending to put a period to his existence. He had put a large quantity of prussic acid in a goblet, intending to drink it in wine. But before pouring out the wine, he resolved to take one last look at his child. The thought of leaving it unprotected in the world, overcame his suicidal intent, and he went to bed, forgetting in his agitation to remove the poison.</p>
               <p>Herbert Sinclair relieved in this awful manner of any fear of his crime ever being known, arranged matters liberally with his half-brother, and accompanied by Clara and his child, he left Philadelphia for Europe, there to spend the remainder of his sad existence</p>
