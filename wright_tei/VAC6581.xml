               <p>FÉLICIE was the daughter of Jean Waldo. She was the joy of her father's life, and
                  the joy of the life of Madame Gabrielle, his wife. She was well named Félicie, for
                  she was happy herself and she made everybody happy. She was a sunbeam in the
                  house, in the workshops, in the court-yard, and among all the neighbors. Her
                  father and mother were waked in the morning by her singing; and many a time, when
                  Jean Waldo was driving a hard bargain with some spinner from the country, the mere
                  sight of his pretty daughter as she crossed the court-yard, and the sound of her
                  voice as she sang a scrap of a hymn or of a crusading song, would turn his
                  attention from his barter, and he would relax his hold on the odd sols and deniers
                  as if he had never clung to them. By the same spells she was the joy of the
                  neighborhood. The beggars loved her, the weavers loved her, she could come and go
                  as she chose even among the fullers and dyers, though they were rough fellows, and
                  there was nothing she could not say or do with their wives and children. When the
                  country spinners came in with their yarn, or the weavers with their webs, they
                  would wait, on one excuse or another, really to get a word with her; and many was
                  the rich farm in the valley to which Félicie went in the summer or autumn to make
                  a long visit as she chose. Félicie was queen of her father's household and of all
                  around.</p>
               <p>On one of the last days in December, Félicie was making a pilgrimage, after her
                  own fashion, to the church of St. Thomas of Fourvières. The hill of Fourvières is
                  a bold height, rising almost from the heart of the old city of Lyons. And Félicie
                  liked nothing better than a brisk scramble to the top, where, as she said, she
                  might see something. This was her almost daily "pilgrimage." She gave it this name
                  in sport, not irreverent. For, as she went, she always passed by old women who
                  were making a pilgrimage, as they do to this hour, to the church of St. Thomas
                  (now the church of "Our Lady"), which was supposed, and is supposed, to have great
                  power in saving from misfortune those who offer their prayers there. Félicie in
                  passing always looked into the little church, and crossed herself with holy water,
                  and fell on her knees at an altar in a little chapel where was a picture of St.
                  Félicie lying on the ground, <choice>
                     <sic>wth</sic>
                     <corr>with</corr>
                  </choice> a vision of Our Lady above. The Félicie who was not a saint would say
                  "Ave Maria" here and "Our Father who art in heaven," and would wait a minute upon
                  her knees, to, "see if her father had anything to say to her"; and<pb n="2-3"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000003"/> then would cross herself again, and, as she passed
                  the great altar, would kneel once more, and so would be out in the fresh air
                  again.</p>
               <p>This was almost an every-day occurrence. On this day Félicie waited a little
                  longer. Among a thousand votive offerings in the church, hung there by those who
                  were grateful for an answer to their prayers, she saw to-day two which she had
                  never seen before. They were pictures,—not, to tell the truth, very well painted.
                  But to Félicie, the finer or coarser art was a matter of very little account. Each
                  of them represented a scene of preservation in danger. In one of them, a young
                  girl, hardly older than Feélicie herself, was to be seen, as she safely floated
                  from a river which bore the ruins of a broken bridge; in the other, a young knight
                  on horseback received unhurt the blows of five terrible Saracens. The Holy Mother
                  could be seen in the clouds with a staff on her arm, turning off the lances of the
                  Paynim. Félicie looked a moment at this picture, but long, very long, at the
                  other.</p>
               <p>The disaster which it represented was one which the girl had seen herself, and
                  which had made upon her an impression for her life. Only the year before, Richard
                  the Lion-Hearted and Philip Augustus of France had come to Lyons together, each
                  with a splendid retinue of knights and other soldiers, on their way to the crusade
                  The Archbishop of Lyons was then really an independent prince, and with all the
                  dignity of an independent price he had received the two kings. There had been much
                  feasting. There had been a splendid ceremony of high mass in the cathedral, and at
                  last, when the two armies had recruited themselves, it was announced that they
                  were to take up their march to the Holy City. Of course all Lyons was on the watch
                  to see the display. Some were in boats upon the river; some were waiting to see
                  them cross the bridge; some walked far out on the road. Girls with flowers threw
                  them before the horse of the handsome English king, and priests in splendid robes
                  carried the banners of the churches and sang anthems as they went. And all Lyons,
                  young and old, was sure that in two or three short months this famous host would
                  be in the City of our Lord!</p>
               <p>Alas, and alas! Hardly had the two kings themselves crossed the bridge, and a few
                  of their immediate attendants with them, when, as the great crowd of towns-people
                  pressed in upon the men-at-arms, all eager to see the show, they felt beneath
                  their feet a horrid tremor for one moment, and then—first one length of the
                  bridge, and then, in terrible succession, two others, gave way, and the whole
                  multitude—soldiers, horses, men, women, and children—were plunged into the Rhone
                  below. The torrent was fast, and swept the ruin of timbers and the mass of
                  struggling people and beasts down in horrible confusion. The boatmen on the river
                  did their best to rescue one and another, but were themselves in danger almost
                  equal to that of those who were struggling in the water. The kings turned their
                  horses and rode to the shore, but were as powerless as children to help or even to
                  command. And so, in one short hour, this day of glory and of victory was shrouded
                  as in clouds of darkness.</p>
               <p>It seemed a miracle, indeed, that only a few were drowned in the chaos; but of
                  those who were rescued, many were maimed for life, and there was not a house in
                  Lyons but had its own tale of danger and suffering.</p>
               <p>The picture which Félicie stopped to look at in the church of St. Thomas
                  represented this calamity, and the preservation, by what was called miracle, of
                  Gabrielle L'Estrange, a godchild of Félicie's mother. For herself, Félicie had
                  seen the breaking of the bridge from the safe distance of her eyrie on the
                  mountain. The girl had wisely seen that even her father's good-will could not do
                  much for a child like her in the crowd. She had declared her determination to see
                  the whole; and while others went into the streets to see the armies pass them,
                  Félicie had perched herself on the very top of the hill Fourvières, where she
                  could see every company join in the cortege, where she could hear the blast of
                  music come up to her from the plain.</p>
               <p>As she sat here, as the army began to cross the river, the girl had been instantly
                  conscious of the great disaster. She could see the companies in the rear break
                  their ranks and rush towards the stream. She could see the dust of the ruin rise
                  above the river, and could hear the hoarse shouting of people screaming and
                  commanding. She had guessed what the calamity was, and had hurried home to meet
                  only too many stories of personal sorrow. Before night they had known how
                  Gabrielle had been nearly lost, and how she had been saved. And all the mingled
                  memories of that day of glory and of grief came back to Félicie again, now that
                  she saw the picture of her playmate's preservation.</p>
               <p>She left the little church, crossing herself again with the holy water, a little
                  more thoughtful than she entered it. The "problem of evil" crossed her mind; and
                  she asked herself why the Virgin should interpose to save Gabrielle, when others
                  were left to perish. But she did not ask this with bitterness. She knew there was
                  answer somewhere. And as she climbed yet higher up the hill, and came out on the
                  glories of her eyrie, the wonders of the winter prospect—more beautiful than ever,
                  as she thought—swept away all memories of death or sorrow or doubt; and the child
                  wrapped her thick shawl round her, as she sat beneath the shelter of a friendly
                  wall, with the full sunlight blazing on her, to wonder for the thousandth time on
                  the beauty of the panorama beyond and below.</p>
               <p>There are who say that no view in France can equal it; and I am sure I do not
                  wonder. At her feet the cheerful city lay between the rivers Saone and Rhone,
                  which meet here, just below her. The spires and towers of the cathedral and the
                  churches, even the tallest columns of smoke, as they rose in the still air, were
                  all far, far below the girl on her eyrie. Beyond, she could see at first large
                  farms with their granges, their immense hay-stacks, their barns, and their
                  orchards. She could pick out and name one and another where at the vintage and at
                  harvest she had made pleasant visits this very year. Further, all became brown and
                  purple and blue and gray. Sometimes on a hill she could make out a white church
                  tower, or the long walls of a castle,—just some sign that men and women and happy
                  girls like herself lived there. But Félicie's eye did not rest so long on these.
                  Far above and still beyond—O how far beyond!—was her "old friend," as the girl
                  called Mont Blanc. And to-day he had his rosy face, she said. The sunset behind
                  her was making the snow of the mountain blush with beauty. And nothing can be
                     conceived<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6581-00000004"/> ceived more dreamy and more
                  lovely than this "vision," as Félicie called it, which even she did not see five
                  times in a year from her eyrie; and which many a lazy canon and abbot, and many a
                  prosperous weaver like her father, and many a thrifty merchant in the town, had
                  never seen at all.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening, dear old friend," said the girl, laughing, as if the mountain could
                  hear her ninety miles away,—"good-evening, dear old friend. You are lovely
                  to-night in your evening dress. Will you not come to my Christmas party? Thank
                  you, old friend, for coming out to-night to see me. I should have been very lonely
                  without you, dear old friend. There's a kiss for you!—and there's another!—and
                  there's a feather for you, and there's another!" And she threw into the west wind
                  two bits of down, and pleased herself with watching them as they floated high and
                  quick towards the mountain in the east. "Good-by, dear old friend, good-by. Mamma
                  says I must be home at sunset. Won't you speak to me?—no matter; all the same I
                  know you love me. Good-by! good-by!" And so she tripped down, thinking to herself
                  as she went that everybody and everything did love her, which was very true;
                  thinking that for her, indeed, God's kingdom seemed to have come, and his will to
                  be done on earth as it was in heaven. And the shadow, if it may be called a
                  shadow, of the horrors depicted in the church of St. Thomas was all swept
                  away.</p>
               <p>Down she tripped again by the open church, and one after another beggar at the
                  door blessed her as she said, "God bless you." Down she tripped by the convent
                  walls, and wondered how the gardens within could be half as beautiful as the world
                  without. And she wondered if the sisters here climbed up the bell-tower and looked
                  off on the eastern horizon to see her old friend, and whether they knew how
                  friendly he was to those who loved him. Down she tripped by one zigzag path and
                  another, known to her and to the goats and to none beside; and so, before the sun
                  was fairly down, she had nodded to Pierre the weaver, and had stopped and spoken
                  to Ronet the dyer, and had caught up and kissed the twin babies who could hardly
                  tottle along the road, whom Marguerite the wife of young Stephen was leading
                  along; she had said a merry word to half the workmen and half their wives, and had
                  come into the court-yard, and had pushed back the stately heavy oak door, and
                  stood in the hall of Jean Waldo's comfortable house.</p>
               <p>Her mother came running out from the kitchen wing to meet the girl. And Félicie
                  ran up to kiss her as she entered, as was her pretty way. And Mistress Gabrielle
                  thought, as she had thought a thousand times, that nobody in the world was as
                  pretty as Félicie, and also that Félicie never had looked as pretty as she did at
                  that very moment. This also had Madam Gabrielle thought a thousand times before.
                  The girl's tightly-fitting tunic was of fine white woollen. But the cape, as in
                  those days the mantle began to be called, also of woollen, was of the brightest
                  scarlet, and, as she had wound it round and round her head, she became a Red
                  Riding-Hood indeed. Her cheeks glowed with life and health as she came running in
                  from the frosty air, and the sharp contrast of her dress was none too bold for a
                  complexion so brilliant. It was the very impersonation of life and joy.</p>
               <p>"Félicie, my child, I have been asking for you. It is St. Victoria's night, you
                  know, and I am giving to them all their Christmas medicine."</p>
               <p>"Medicine for me, my dear mother!" And truly the child seemed to need medicine as
                  little as the larks.</p>
               <p>"Of course, dear Félicie. Has there been a midsummer or a Christmas since you were
                  born in which I did not give you your medicine? And so is it, thanks to the
                  blessed Virgin and to St. Félicie, that you are so fresh and so well. I have given
                  to your father and to all their men their gentian. I have given to all the women
                  their St. Johnswort, and here is a nice new bottle of the mixture of lavender and
                  rosemary, which I brewed for you when you were away with the Landrys. I have it
                  all waiting."</p>
               <p>Félicie knew by long experience that there was no good in argument. Indeed the
                  child was too much used to doing what her mother bade to make argument at any
                  time. This was but a gulp or two of a disagreeable taste, and she knew there would
                  be waiting a honey-cake and an orange after it. So she kissed her mother, ran
                  up-stairs and put away cape and wimple and girdle, and came down-stairs singing:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>My lady came down from her pretty gay room,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">In the hall my lady sat down;</l>
                        <l>Her apron was draped with the roses in bloom,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And her fingers braided a crown, crown, crown!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And her fingers braided a crown!</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"But, mamma! how much there is of it. I never had so much before!"</p>
               <p>"Darling, you are older now. You have passed your second climacteric." Mistress
                  Gabrielle could be learned when she chose.</p>
               <p>"But, mamma, it tastes horridly It never tasted so badly before."</p>
               <p>"Dear child, drink it right down Here is your orange, to take the taste away.
                  Perhaps it is a little stronger than we have made it. The leaves were the very
                  best I ever saw."</p>
               <p>And the dear child made a laughing face of disgust, and then gulped down the
                  bitter mixture as she was bidden.</p>
               <p>But then all light faded from her face. With agony such as her mother never saw
                  there, she screamed, "O mamma, dear mamma!—it burns me, it burns me!—you never
                  hurt your darling so before!" And with sobs she could not repress, she hid her
                  face in her mother's bosom, crying out, "O, how it burns, how it burns!"</p>
               <p>Mistress Gabrielle was frightened indeed. She tore open the orange, but there was
                  little comfort there. She sent for oils and for snow, and for cold water from the
                  very bottom of the well. But the child's agony seemed hardly checked; and though
                  with a resolute will she would choke down her groans that she might not terrify
                  her mother, it was impossible for her to check the quivering from head to foot,
                  which was a sign of the torture of mouth and throat and stomach. Mistress
                  Gabrielle called for Jeanne and Marie, and they carried the poor child to her bed.
                  They put hot cloths upon her. They warmed her feet and her hands. They made smokes
                  of gums and barks for her to breathe. They tried all the simple and all the
                  complicated arts of the household. One and another neighbor was hurried in, and
                     each<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6581-00000005"/> contradicted the other, and each
                  advised.</p>
               <p>One or other of the more powerful applications would give a moment's relief, but
                  only a moment's. Tears which she could not check would roll down Félicie's check
                  to show her inward torture, and that terrible quiver which Mistress Gabrielle
                  learned to dread so horribly would come in with every third or fourth minute. Once
                  and again she had sent for Jean Waldo, her husband. But none of the lads could
                  find him. Night had closed dark around them, and he did not return. It was then
                  that she took the responsibility which she had never taken before, and sent for
                  the young Florentine doctor, whose shop, next the cathedral, attracted the wonder
                  and superstition of all the neighborhood. "Bid him come, Adrian, on the moment!
                  Tell him that my daughter is dying, and that he has not a moment to lose. For the
                  love of Christ, beg him to come on the instant." Dying! The word struck new terror
                  in the whole panic-swayed household. Everybody had been in distress, but no one
                  had dared think or say that the darling of them all, but just now so strong and so
                  happy, could die! Least of all had Mistress Gabrielle permitted herself to think
                  it. But now all her pride was gone. Niobe before Apollo was not more prostrate.
                  She knew that if the Florentine was to render any help, it must be rendered right
                  soon. And so, with a calmness of despair at which she wondered herself, she sent
                  word to him that her daughter was dying.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">JEAN WALDO.</head>
               <p>GIULIO, the Florentine doctor, came up the street with the boy who had been sent
                  for him, and with a blackamoor who bore a great hamper which contained his
                  medicines and his instruments. As they rapidly approached the doorway they
                  overtook Jean Waldo himself, slowly walking up the street. Till they spoke to him,
                  the father was wholly unconscious of the calamity which had fallen on his
                  child.</p>
               <p>If you had told Jean Waldo that afternoon, as he sat in the Treasurer's seat at
                  the guild-meeting, that, in after times, his name of Waldo would be best known to
                  all people, in all lands, because his kinsman, Pierre Waldo, bore it, he would
                  have been much amazed, and would have taken you for a fool. Kinsmen they were,
                  there was no doubt of that. Nobody could look on their faces—nay, even on their
                  eyes or their beards, or on the shape of their hands or their finger-nails, and
                  not see that there was near kindred between them. "We are both from the valley of
                  vaud," Jean Waldo used to say when people questioned him. But he was not pleased
                  to have them question him. He had taken good care not to mix himself up with
                  Pierre Waldo's heresies. "Why does he want to trouble himself about the priests?"
                  said Jean Waldo. "Why does he not do as I do? I take care of myself, and I let
                  other people take care of themselves. Why cannot Pierre Waldo, my kinsman, if he
                  is my kinsman, do as I do?" prosperous way. He squeezed down the spinners who
                  brought yarn to him. He squeezed the weavers who brought him webs. He kept a good
                  company of the best workmen, bleachers and dyers, in his own workshops, and he had
                  near forty looms of his own, with his own weavers. He put up linen cloths for
                  market more neatly and handsomely, the traders said, than any man in Lyons, and so
                  he prospered exceedingly. "This is what comes," he said, "of minding your own
                  business, and letting other people's business alone."</p>
               <p>Pierre Waldo, the kinsman of whom Jean spoke with such contempt, and who is now
                  remembered in all the world where the Christian religion is known, had been a
                  prosperous merchant in Lyons. But Pierre Waldo was not one of those who went to
                  mass only because the priests bade him. He went to the mass because God had been
                  good to him and to his, and he wanted to express his thanks. He was glad to
                  express thanks as other people did and where they did. He had always had a passion
                  for reading, for in his boyhood his mother had taught him to read. And when, one
                  day, a parchment book came in his way, which proved to be an Evangelistary, or
                  copy of the Four Gospels, in Latin, Pierre Waldo began to try to read this, and
                  with wonder and delight which cannot be told. Father John of Lugio, the priest
                  whom he knew best, an honest man and an humble priest was willing to help Pierre
                  as he could about the Latin. And there was not so much difference in those days
                  between Latin and the Romance language which half Pierre Waldo's customers used,
                  that he should find it hard to make out the language in which the book was written
                  that so excited him. When Father John saw how much pleasure Pierre Waldo took in
                  such reading, he was glad to show to him, in the church and in the vestry, other
                  parchments, in which were Paul's letters and the Book of the Revelation. And at
                  last Pierre had seen the whole of the Old Testament also, and he and the good
                  priest had read some parts of the Old Law.</p>
               <p>Who shall say whether this knowledge of the Bible could ever have come to anything
                  with Pierre Waldo, but for a terrible incident which made its mark on his whole
                  life? He and the other merchants of his section of the town used to meet each
                  other very often at little feasts, in which they showed their hospitality and
                  wealth at the same time, in the elegance of the service, the richness of the food,
                  and in the choice of the good old wine. A party of them were together one night at
                  such a feast in the house of Robert the Gascon. They had eaten a hearty supper.
                  The wine had passed freely, and one of the company, a favorite with all of them,
                  had sung a love song such as the romances of the day were full of. The glasses
                  clattered in the applause, and one and another of the guests bade him sing it
                  again. But for some reason Walter, the singer, declined. The moment he said "No,"
                  William Jal, an old and near friend of Pierre Waldo, who was sitting at his side
                  at the table, rose and said, with a loud laugh, "You shall sing it, Walter!" And
                  he brought his fist down on the table, and with this terrible oath he went
                  on,—</p>
               <p>"By God, you shall sing it, Walter, or I will never taste wine again!"</p>
               <p>Hardly had the awful words left<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6581-00000006"/> his mouth
                  when the expression of his face changed in sudden agony. He seemed to try to
                  balance himself at the table for an instant, and then fell dead upon the
                  floor.</p>
               <p>From that moment Pierre Waldo was a new man. In the night of horror which followed
                  this scene of mockery and revel, in his wretched efforts to comfort the widow to
                  whom they carried the cold corpse home, and the poor children who were waked from
                  their beds to look upon it,—in that night of horror Pierre Waldo had chance to
                  look forward and to look backward. And he did so. From that time forward his
                  reading of the Gospel was no mere literary amusement. He copied it for his own
                  use; he translated it for his neighbors' use. He found that other men, anxious and
                  pious, had already felt as he began to feel,—that all the people had a right to
                  parable, to psalm, and to the words of the blessed Master. One after another of
                  his customers brought him, from one and another town where they travelled, bits of
                  Paul or Matthew or Luke which had been translated into the vulgar language. Pierre
                  Waldo's home and his warehouse became the centre of those who sought a purer and
                  simpler life. For himself, after that dreadful night with the fatherless children
                  and their mother, Pierre Waldo said he would give all he had to the poor. Whoever
                  was in need in Lyons or in the country round came to him for advice and for help,
                  and they gained it. If they came for food, they had food—always they found a
                  friend.</p>
               <p>Almost all the company of merchants who were with Pierre on that night joined him
                  in this service of those that were in need. The company of them began to be
                  called, and called themselves, the "Poor Men of Lyons." They had no new religion.
                  Their religion was what they found in the Saviour's words to the young nobleman,
                  to Peter the fisherman, and to Mary Magdalene. And so taken were they with these
                  words, that they read them to all who came for help to them, and were eager to
                  copy them out in the people's language, and give the copies to all who would carry
                  them into the country.</p>
               <p>Almost at the same time, Francisco of Assisi was moved in much the same way to
                  give up all he had to the poor, and to preach the gospel of poverty. If these two
                  men had come together! But it does not appear that they ever heard each other's
                  names.</p>
               <p>No! At that time Lyons was governed wholly by the great religious corporation
                  which was known as the Chapter of St. John, under the Archbishop, who was in fact
                  a Prince, and as a Prince governed the city and the country at his will. When he
                  found that the merchants were entering on the business of distributing the
                  Scriptures and reading them to the people, the Archbishop and the Chapter forbade
                  it. The "Poor Men of Lyons" must leave that business to the clergy.</p>
               <p>Pierre and his friends were amazed. They went to the Holy Father at Rome, and told
                  him what their work was. He was well pleased with it, gave them his approval, but
                  told them they must not preach without the permission of the Archbishop and
                  Chapter. This permission those great men would not grant to the "Poor Men." They
                  refused it squarely.</p>
               <p>Refused permission to make the words of the Lord Jesus known! It was at this point
                  that Pierre Waldo and the Poor Men of Lyons broke away from the priests and the
                  Pope. "They have abandoned the faith," he said; "and we ought to obey God rather
                  than man."</p>
               <p>This was the signal on which the Archbishop and the Chapter drove Pierre Waldo out
                  from Lyons, and all those who followed him. His house and his warehouses, all his
                  books that they could find, they seized, and he and his had to take flight into
                  the mountains.</p>
               <p>This was the reason why the prosperous Jean Waldo, the master-weaver, the father
                  of the pretty Félicie, was not well pleased when men asked him if he and Pierre
                  Waldo were kinsmen or no. He did not want to be mixed up with any "Poor Men of
                  Lyons." Not he. He was not one of the poor men of Lyons, and he did not mean to
                  be. Pierre Waldo was in a good-business, he said; there was not a merchant in
                  Lyons with better prospects before him, when he took up with his reading and
                  writing, his beggars, his ministers, and all the rest of their crew. And so Jean
                  Waldo would come out, again and again, with his favorite motto: "I take care of
                  myself, let them take care of themselves. If Pierre would have stuck to his own
                  business, he would not be hiding in the mountains there."</p>
               <p>Such was the man who, as he slowly walked up the hill just now, thought himself
                  above all need of asking a service from any man in this world. He would not have
                  recognized Giulio the Florentine this very afternoon, if they had passed each
                  other, though he knew the man's face perfectly well. If you had asked him why he
                  did not salute such a man, or even show a consciousness of his existence, Jean
                  Waldo would have said,—</p>
               <p>"I take care of myself; let the Florentine take care of himself. My business is
                  not his, and his is not mine."</p>
               <p>But now, as has been said, in the narrow street, the Florentine and his servant,
                  and the boy Adrian, who had been sent to summon him in hot haste, overtook the
                  dignified master-weaver, as he walked home slowly and complacently. It was with no
                  little difficulty that Jean Waldo was made to understand that his treasure and
                  delight, his own Félicie, who only at dinner-time had been so happy and so lovely,
                  was dying, or seemed to be dying, in the home he left so little while before.</p>
               <p>After this it was not Jean Waldo who walked slowly in that party. He seized the
                  great basket which the black servant bore, and fairly compelled him in his energy
                  to go faster. He poured question upon question out as to what had happened upon
                  the Florentine, who was of course wholly unable to answer him. And thus the
                  breathless party arrived together, under the heavy archway of the courtyard of
                  Jean Waldo's house.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE FLORENTINE.</head>
               <p>THE young physician whom Madame Gabrielle had summoned to the rescue, was an
                  native of the city of Florence, and he had not been so long a<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000007"/> resident of Lyons but that he was still called "the
                  Florentine." At that time the profession of a physician, as a distinct calling
                  among men, was scarcely known. The clergy were expected to know something of the
                  cure of disease, and in some instances they really attained remarkable skill in
                  its treatment.</p>
               <p>But with the knowledge of eastern art which had come in with the first and second
                  crusades, and with the persistent study of those naturalists whom we call
                  alchemists, a wider and more scientific knowledge of the human frame and its
                  maladies was beginning to take the place of old superstitions and other delusions.
                  And thus it happened that here and there was a man who, without being a priest on
                  the one hand or a barber on the other, had gained the repute of understanding
                  disease and of the power of keeping death at bay. Such a man was Giulio the
                  Florentine.</p>
               <p>He moved quickly and with a decided step. He spoke little, and always after a
                  moment's pause, if he were questioned. It seemed as if he spoke by some sort of
                  machinery, which could not be adjusted without an instant's delay. What he said
                  was crisp and decided, as were his steps in walking. It was impossible to see his
                  manner, even of crossing the room, or of arranging his patient's head upon the
                  pillow, without feeling confidence in him. "I felt as if there were a prophet in
                  the house," said Mathilde, one of the maid-servants, who had been sent for hot
                  water into the kitchen, and in that minute took occasion to repeat her hasty
                  observations to the excited party assembled there.</p>
               <p>When he entered the sick-room, it was more than an hour after Félicie had drained
                  to the bottom the beaker which Madame Gabrielle had filled full of the bitter
                  decoction. The burning pain of the first draught had passed away or had been
                  relieved by some of the palliatives which had been given. But the second stage was
                  if possible more terrible than that of the agony of the beginning. On the pretty
                  bed where they had laid her, in the chamber which the child had decorated with the
                  various treasures which she had acquired in her wanderings, she would lie for a
                  few minutes as if insensible, and then would spring up in the most violent
                  convulsions. She threw herself from side to side without knowing any of those who
                  tried to soothe her, and who were forced to hold her. A few minutes of this
                  violence would be followed by renewed insensibility which seemed almost as
                  terrible.</p>
               <p>Just after one of these paroxysms, her mother was wiping away the frothy blood
                  which burst from the poor child's nostrils, when the Florentine entered the room.
                  She made place for him, in a moment, by the bed; and, with that firm hand of the
                  prophet, which struck Mathilde with such awe, he felt his patient's forehead and
                  then the pulse in her wrist. Then he examined, one by one, the simples which the
                  mother and her neighbors had been administering by way of emetic and of antidote.
                  From his own hamper, with the aid of the blackamoor, he supplied the places of
                  these with tinctures—of which the use in medicine was then almost wholly new—of
                  which he knew the force, and on the results of which he could rely. He applied and
                  continued the external applications which the eager women were making to the poor
                  child's body. But having noted, in about two minutes, who of these various
                  assistants had a head, and never spoke, he then banished from the room, with a
                  kind dignity that nothing could resist, all the others, except the poor mother. He
                  crossed to the window, and, though the night was so cold, he admitted a breath of
                  the winter air. Then he came back to the bedside, and, with the courtesy of a
                  monarch, asked Madame to tell him all she could of the tragedy. With the courtesy
                  of a monarch he listened to her rambling story, still keeping his hand on the
                  forehead or on the pulse of his patient. Madame Gabrielle, with the tears running
                  down her checks, plunged into the account of what had happened; and to all she
                  said he gave careful heed, never once attempting to check her, even in the wildest
                  excursions which she made to the right or to the left,—into "<foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">dit-elle</foreign>" and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dit-il</foreign>
                  and "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">je disais,</foreign>"— "says he" and "says she" and
                  "says I." He seemed to know that with all her tackings, even if she "missed stays"
                  sometimes, she would come by her own course best to her voyage's end.</p>
               <p>It was not till this whole story was over that he asked to see the diet-drink, as
                  Madame called it, which had worked all this misery. But at that moment, his poor
                  patient started in another spasm of these terrible convulsions.</p>
               <p>Then was it that the balance and steadiness of the "prophet" showed itself as it
                  had not shown itself till now. He seemed to control even her almost by a word, as
                  none of the chattering or beseeching of those whom he had sent away had done. When
                  he held her, he held her indeed, so that she did not even struggle against his
                  grasp; when he bade her open her mouth to swallow the sedative which the black
                  brought him at his direction, the poor delirious child obeyed him as she would
                  obey a God; and under such control the crisis passed, her mother said, much more
                  easily and quickly than that of half an hour before. Still there was the same
                  bloody froth upon her lips and nostrils, there was the same deadly pallor as of a
                  corpse; and the haggard aspect which came at once over the face seemed to Madame
                  Gabrielle and her two waiting women more terrible than ever. The Florentine noted
                  the pulse again, as the exhausted child sank back, and counted the rapidity of her
                  breathing. Then for the first time he began his examination of the poison.</p>
               <p>He tasted it, once and again, as fearlessly as if it had been water or wine. If he
                  were puzzled, or if he were distressed by what he learned, he did not show it in
                  any glance of those black eyes, or in the least change of any other feature. He
                  turned to Madame Gabrielle again to ask her when it was brewed, and where she had
                  obtained the materials.</p>
               <p>The answer was as voluble as before, and was not, alas, very helpful. The good
                  dame's custom, for years upon years,—ever since she was a married woman
                  indeed,—had been to go on St. John's Day and on St. Margaret's Day and on the Eve
                  of the Assumption and on Halloween, to collect the various ingredients which were
                  necessary for the different home medicines of a household so large as hers.
                  Rosemary, wild lavender, Mary's lavender, tansey, rue, herb-saffron, herb-dittany,
                  motherwort, spearwort. maid's wort, and St. John's wort, herb of heaven, herb of
                  winter, poison-kill, and feverfew, she named them all glibly. And<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000008"/> if the expert shuddered within as he thought of the
                  principles which were hidden under these names, repeated so recklessly by an
                  ignorant woman, he did not show his anger or vexation. And this year, as usual,
                  she said she had gone out on the Eve of St. John's day,—surely he knew that
                  spearwort and herb-of-heaven and herb-dittany were never so strong as when you
                  gathered them on the Eve of St. John's Day, if the moon were at the full,—and
                  again she went out, with the two bay horses on the St. Margaret's Day at e'en, and
                  came back with three large baskets full of simples. So she did on Assumption Eve.
                  But when it came to Halloween she confessed that she was kept at home, watching
                  the conservation of some peaches. The accident—for accident of course there
                  was—must have happened then. She had sent out Goodwife Prudhon, who certainly
                  ought to know. If any one knew anything about the simples of the valley, it was
                  Goodwife Prudhon. It was she who brought in the bark and the roots of the autumn,
                  which the dame herself had not collected. And for the brewing itself—O! that was
                  on St. Elizabeth's Day and St. Cecile's Day. The posset indeed was mixed of
                  decoctions which were not six weeks old.</p>
               <p>Could she bring him any of the roots of bark which Madame Prudhon brought her, or
                  had she used them all?</p>
               <p>O! Madame Gabrielle was quite sure she had not used them all; and she retired, to
                  search for what might be left, to her own sanctuary, not sorry, perhaps, thus to
                  avoid for the moment the presence of her wretched husband. He had been sent away
                  from the room on some errand which had been made for him by the ingenuity of the
                  Florentine, and it was only at this moment that he returned.</p>
               <p>So in poor Félicie's next paroxysm of convulsions it was Jean Waldo who obeyed the
                  Florentine's orders. And in that crisis the Florentine took his measure also, and
                  learned what manner of man he was. The father was as firm as the physician. He
                  knew his place too, and he obeyed every direction to a letter. It was piteous to
                  see how he sought for a recognition from his daughter, which she would not give.
                  But whether he hoped or despaired, the poor man could obey. He brought what the
                  Florentine bade him bring. He stood where he bade him stand. With a hand as firm
                  as the physician's, he dropped the drops of the sedative from the silver flask in
                  which it was kept. And with a hand and arm as steady, he supported the pillow on
                  which she was to fall back after she had taken it. The paroxysm was shorter and
                  less vehement than those before it. But it seemed to be checked, rather from the
                  exhaustion of the patient, than from any relaxation of the disease. Jean Waldo
                  himself knew that flesh and blood could not long abide racking so terrible.</p>
               <p>As she sank back to rest, the Florentine counted her pulsations and the rate of
                  her breathing as carefully as he did before. He took from his pocket a silver
                  ball, opened it by a screw, and drew from the interior a long silken cord, one end
                  of which was attached to it. At the other end was a small silver hook, and this
                  the Florentine fastened high in the curtains of the room opposite to where he was
                  sitting. He had thus made a pendulum, several ells in length, and he set it to
                  swinging solemnly. He returned to the child's bedside, and with his hand upon her
                  heart noted the wiry, stubborn pulsations, and compared their number with the
                  vibrations of the ball he had set in motion. Once and again he bade Jean Waldo
                  strike the ball for him, when its original motion was in part exhausted.</p>
               <p>While they were thus occupied, poor Madame Gabrielle, the guilty or guiltless
                  another of so much wretchedness, returned. Her apron was full of herbs, barks,
                  powders, and roots, tied up in separate parcels, and each parcel carefully
                  labelled. The Florentine took them, one by one, tasted each, and made a note of
                  the name of each, the blackamoor holding his inkhorn for him that he might do so.
                  The mother by this time was awed into silence, and never spoke till she was spoken
                  to; but when she was asked, she was confident in her replies. They were able
                  without the least doubt to lay out upon the table the bark, the two parcels of
                  leaves, and the white roots which had been steeped and soaked, boiled and brewed,
                  in the preparation of the "diet-drink".</p>
               <p>As if he had to adjust his speaking apparatus with a little "click," or as if he
                  disliked to speak at all, the Florentine said to the father and the mother, "Here
                  was the good-wife Prudhon's blunder. She thought that she had here the root of
                  Spanish maiden-wort. She did not see the leaves; I suppose they bad dried up and
                  were gone. But it is the root of hemlock-leaved œnanthe, what the peasants call
                  snake-bane. Juba, bring me the parcel of œnanthe." He showed to the father and
                  mother that good-wife Prudhon's maiden wort was, in fact, the most dreaded poison
                  in his repertory.</p>
               <p>"And is there no antidote?" asked the father, so eagerly!</p>
               <p>"The antidote," said the physician, kindly, "is to do what your wife has tried to
                  do,—to throw out from the dear child's body what by such misfortune has been put
                  in." And he said one word to comfort the poor blunderer. "Well for her that she
                  was at home, and that her mother was at hand." Then he added reverently, "God only
                  knows how much is left in her stomach of this decoction; but she drank enough of
                  it to have killed us all, had not her mother's promptness compelled her stomach to
                  throw off the most part of the poison."</p>
               <p>And this was all that he seemed disposed to say. The father and the mother were
                  both in too much awe of him to dare to question him. With the lapse of every
                  half-hour he would bid one or the other of them set his silver pendulum in motion,
                  and he would note carefully the pulse of the girl, entering on his note-book a
                  memorandum of his observation. But neither Jean Waldo nor his wife dared ask if
                  there were improvement or decline. He renewed from time to time the applications
                  which had been made to the child's feet and legs and stomach. From time to time
                  she started again in the terrible convulsions. But these were shorter and shorter,
                  and more and more infrequent, either from the power of his medicines, or from some
                  change in the action of the poison. Jean Waldo thought that the physician regarded
                  the reaction from the paroxysm as more alarming than the struggle itself. But who
                  could tell what that man of iron thought, or did not think; felt, or did not feel?
                  The poor father knew that very probably he was but imagining that the
                     Florentine<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6581-00000009"/> entine showed his own
                  anxieties. And who was he to ask him?</p>
               <p>At midnight the girl started up in one of these spasms of agony; and at this time
                  she spoke with more connection of ideas than any of them had been able to trace
                  before: "This way! this way! Gabrielle, dear Gabrielle, do you not hear me, my
                  child? It is Félicie,—your own pet, Gabrielle! Never fear! never fear! I have
                  spoken to Our Mother, to Our Lady, you know! That is brave—my own little cousin,
                  that is brave. Care! Care! See that heavy timber! O how good! O how good! She is
                  quite right, quite right. All safe, all safe, all safe" And as she sighed out
                  these words, she rested from the most violent and passionate exertion, as if she
                  had been hard at work in some effort, which the Florentine did not in the least
                  understand.</p>
               <p>It was the first time that he ever seemed to make any inquiry regarding her
                  symptoms, and he looked his curiosity rather than expressed it. Madame Waldo was
                  relieved at having a fair opportunity to speak. "Gabrielle is her cousin, my
                  sister Margaret's oldest daughter, if you please. Félicie is fond—O so fond—of
                  Gabrielle. And she thinks Gabrielle is in danger, O yes! O yes! See, she thinks
                  the bridge is breaking, and that Gabrielle is in the water. Your reverence
                  remembers, perhaps, that the Holy Mother saved Gabrielle and so many more when the
                  bridge went down." But by this time the physician, only bowing civilly as he
                  acknowledged her voluble explanations, was counting the pulse-beats again, and by
                  a motion directed Jean Waldo to renew the vibration of the pendulum.</p>
               <p>Was he perhaps a little more satisfied with his count and comparison than he had
                  been before? Who can tell? for none of the four attendants in the darkened room
                  dared to ask him.</p>
               <p>And then he sent Jean Waldo away. The wretched father begged that he might stay,
                  but the Florentine was as flint. Madame Gabrielle and one of her maids would give
                  him all the assistance he wanted besides what his own man could render him, and
                  more. Indeed, he would send her away also, he said, in an aside, but that he knew
                  it would kill her to go. At last he pitied the poor beseeching father so much that
                  he promised to let him come in, an hour before day-break, and take his wife's
                  place at the bedside of his child. Jean Waldo went because he was bidden. His
                  strong, selfish will gave way before the strong, unselfish will of this stranger.
                  Prophet indeed! This prophet worked the miracle of commanding Jean Waldo, and he
                  saw that he obeyed him.</p>
               <p>Long before it was light, however, the heart-broken father, who had slept not a
                  wink in the dreary hours between, came to claim the right of taking his turn. And
                  now he and the Florentine sent Madame Gabrielle away, weak as she now was from her
                  wretchedness and her watching and her anxiety. Yes! The night had given but little
                  of encouragement. The paroxysms of convulsion were, it is true, more and more
                  seldom; but the prostration after them was more and more terrible. It seemed too
                  clear now to the mother that the child was too weak for nature to rally from the
                  struggle of the paroxysm. Nor did she in the least regain her consciousness. The
                  black features and strange look of the servant did not surprise her, nor did her
                  mother's familiar face call the least look of recognition. In the intervals of
                  rest, her rest was absolute lute. She saw nothing, said nothing, and seemed to
                  hear nothing then. When she roused to these horrid battles the delusion was now
                  one thing and now another. She saw the sinking bridge, or she was talking to some
                  lame beggar woman, so fast that they could hardly catch her words, or she was
                  throwing kisses and waving her hand to her dear mountain far away, or she was
                  running down the side of the Hill of Fourvières that she might be sure to arrive
                  at home in time to meet her father when she came down to supper. In these
                  delusions the wise physician humored her. But she seemed to have no knowledge of
                  him nor of any of them, nor any consciousness of their presence. The phantoms
                  before her were all she saw or heard. And they vanished as strangely and as
                  suddenly as they came. In the midst of one of these quick harangues to them, she
                  would sink back on the pillow, which the black held ready for her, as if she were
                  too completely exhausted and prostrate with the exertion to utter another
                  syllable.</p>
               <p>It was just after one of these visions, and the paroxysm accompanying it, that
                  Jean Waldo returned, and that his wife was sent away. It seemed that the resolute
                  man had been nursing resolution in his night-watch in the passage-way, and that he
                  was resolved to know the best or the worst; that he would command the young man to
                  tell him all that he could tell him. He set the pendulum in motion as he was
                  bidden; he filled with hotter water a jar for the child's feet to rest upon, and
                  exchanged for it that which was on the bed; he spread the napkin at her mouth, as
                  the Florentine fed her from an elixir, which, as Jean Waldo saw, was not the same
                  which they used at midnight. Then when she rested and all was still, he said,
                  firmly,—</p>
               <p>"Tell me the worst, sir. Is the child dying or living? I am not a fool."</p>
               <p>The Florentine looked up and said, after the moment of preparation, "If I thought
                  you were a fool, you would not be in the room with my patient. You know all that I
                  know, because you have eyes to see. These paroxysms of agony are less frequent.
                  The last interval was nearly twice as long as the first was, I should think. She
                  is wholly free from pain too, and her pulse, though it beats so quick, beats with
                  a more reasonable edge than when I came in. But her strength is failing all the
                  same. Her breath is quicker; and if the interval is longer, it is because nerve
                  and muscle and life, whatever that is, cannot rally to the struggle as they did in
                  the evening. She is at the omnipotent age, and her life has been strong and pure
                  as an angel's. Were it not for that she would have been dead before now." And the
                  silent man paused, but paused as if he would like to say something more.</p>
               <p>For this "something more" the distressed father waited; he thought he waited an
                  eternity, but it did not come. "Can you not say anything more?" he said,
                  miserably. "What is it that we are doing? What are these elixirs and tisans? Is
                  not there somewhere in God's world, some potion—do you not call it an
                  antidote—which will put out this poison as water puts out fire?"</p>
               <p>"Is there not? Is there?" said the Florentine, setting the click of his talking
                  apparatus more resolutely if possible than before "If there is, the wit of man has
                  not discovered it. How should it? The water which puts out the fire is the same
                     water<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6581-00000010"/> which drowns the sailor. For
                  aught you and I can tell, this root, of which the decoction seemed liquid flame
                  when your daughter drank it, may give life itself to some fish or beast or bird
                  for which the good God made it. All that we do, my friend,"—it was the first time
                  he had used those words in that house,—"all that we do is to undo what we did
                  wrong before. We have tried to rid her system of this wretched decoction, and now
                  we are trying to give time, whatever that is; and nature, whatever that is,—the
                  chance to do their perfect work. We can do nothing more. The good God wishes and
                  means to save health and strength and joy and abundant life. So much we know; and
                  knowing that, in the strength and life of a pure child of His, like this girl, we
                  hope, and have a right to hope."</p>
               <p>"Is this all?" said the father sadly, after another pause, in which he thought the
                  Florentine wanted to say more. "Is this all? What is the tisan, what is the
                  mustard on her stomach, what is the rubbing, what is the hot water at her feet,
                  what is the elixir in your phial?"</p>
               <p>"Ah well!" replied the expert, after a longer pause than usual perhaps, in what
                  seemed like the adjustment of his machinery; "what is it indeed? It is our poor
                  effort to quicken and help from the outside the processes of this nature which is
                  so mysterious in the beautiful machine. The hot water at her feet keeps them more
                  near to the warmth which nature gives. My master taught me that when the foot and
                  arm and leg are fully warm, each movement of the heart drove easily a tide of the
                  blood of life itself through them all. You can see that the warmth of the jar
                  should make that process easier for this poor heart which finds its work so hard.
                  Ah well! it seems as if we helped it more by the friction of these cloths, so long
                  as we do not annoy her by it, and as if these sinapisms wrought in the same way.
                  We think we know that within her system tinctures which we have tried give the
                  same help to a life which is too weak. Perhaps they enable some part of her
                  nervous system which the poison has not reached to act for the good of the part
                  that it first affected."</p>
               <p>Then the talking apparatus seemed to fail the expert. He opened his mouth once and
                  again; he then said "I" once or twice, but seemed to reconsider his determination,
                  and to determine that he would add nothing more.</p>
               <p>"But we are so well, and she is so faint there. Is it not strange that I cannot
                  give her of this fresh blood of mine, or from my life, five years, ten, twenty? I
                  would give them gladly."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my friend," said the expert, without a moment's pause this time; "do not
                  speak as if we gave anything or did anything. It is God gives, and God who takes.
                  All that you and I can do is so to adjust and so to relieve, and perhaps so to
                  help, this poor frail machine, that the breath of life God gave it may be able to
                  work His work. You would give your life for hers, I do not doubt it. For one, I
                  would have given my life once for the brother who was dearest to me. My master
                  opened the vein which you see scarred here, and with a silver tube he drew the
                  healthy, fresh blood from my young life into the failing veins of his ebbing life.
                  But it could not be, my friend," he added, after another long pause. "His life was
                  his, and mine was mine. Perhaps in another world our lives may be closer, and we
                  may be made perfect in one." It seemed as if this confidence with the father broke
                  some spell which had been on the adept's tongue before. He sat still for a few
                  minutes, with his hand upon the girl's heart, then rose and went round the bed,
                  and at her back listened for her breath, and felt again the heat of his water
                  jugs. Then as he resumed his seat, he said, half aloud:—</p>
               <p>"I wish my master were here!" It was the first wish he had expressed, the first
                  intimation that he and his horrid blackamoor and the great hamper could not
                  produce everything which human wit could suggest in the exigency.</p>
               <p>Jean Waldo jumped eagerly at the suggestion.</p>
               <p>"Your master? Who is he, where is he? Let me send, let me go, let me beg him to
                  come. Will money buy him? Here is enough of that! What are gold and silver to me,
                  if this child die?"</p>
               <p>"Has not this night taught you, sir, that life is something that men cannot buy or
                  sell?" The adept spake if possible more proudly than ever. "Know, sir, the reason
                  why my master was not first at this child's bedstead, with all his skill and
                  tenderness and experience. It is because he cared for the Poor Men of Lyons, more
                  than the Rich men of Lyons."</p>
               <p>Then there came one of those queer clicks in his talking machinery, as if he were
                  too indignant to say more. But he went on:—</p>
               <p>"Your priests yonder, with their bells and their masses, and their feasts inside
                  their convents; your famous chapter and your famous abbot could not bear to have
                  the 'Poor Men of Lyons' fed or taught, and so they drove my master away, and your
                  kinsman away, and you know how many others. Men say and I believe that it was
                  because these men knew Holy Scripture better than they knew it, and because they
                  loved the poor better than they loved them. This is certain, that these men went
                  about doing good, that they fed the hungry and gave drink to the thirsty, they
                  took the stranger into their homes and they ministered to the sick and those that
                  were in prison, they brought glad tidings to the poor and comfort to those in
                  sorrow. I do not know much of Holy Scripture, but I always supposed that this was
                  the Pure Gospel. It was not pure enough for your priests, and so the liege lords
                  of Lyons drove those men away. That is the reason why my master is not at your
                  daughter's bedside."</p>
               <p>The young physician stopped short, as if he had let his indignation run further
                  than was wise. A wretched feeling, a sickness at heart swept over Jean Waldo, when
                  he remembered how often he had said to these men who were in exile with his
                  kinsman, that they would have been wiser to have minded their own business. Of his
                  kinsman himself he had said, once and again, "If he would only mind his own
                  concerns, all would be well." Now Jean Waldo began to see that he did want some
                  one to take care of him and his, and that this grand selfishness of his was only
                  fitted for the times of high prosperity.</p>
               <p>"Is your master beyond all recall?" he said, a dim notion crossing his mind that
                  he had heard some of the rich burghers say that the "Poor Men of Lyons" were
                  hiding in the mountains.</p>
               <p>"I have not seen my master there," replied the Florentine, thoughtfully "His home
                  is in the Brevon caves,<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6581-00000011"/> among men who
                  have never betrayed him, beyond Cornillon and St. Rambert."</p>
               <p>"St. Rambert," said the father, eagerly,—"St. Rambert,—it is close to us, a
                  miserable six hours away. I have horses in these stables that would take me there
                  in six hours."</p>
               <p>The adept looked uneasily at the child, when her father spoke of six hours, as if
                  he would say, "And where will she be when six hours only are gone?" But he did not
                  say this. He said, "My master is not at Cornillon, he is in the valley of the
                  Brevon beyond. Still, as you say, that is not so far away."</p>
               <p>"Send for him! send for him!" cried the father; "send for him if you have one ray
                  of hope!" And the eagerness both of his attitude and his voice would have moved a
                  harder listener than the Florentine. It seemed as if the child herself was
                  conscious of what passed. She moved her head a little on the pillow and a sunny
                  smile floated over her face, the first expression except that of agony or anxiety
                  which the adept had seen there.</p>
               <p>"If you will send, I will write," said the adept; and he whispered to the black,
                  who brought to him from a case in the hamper a strip of vellum already folded for
                  a letter.</p>
               <p>"Have you a trusty man whom you can send with this? Bid your grooms saddle the
                  horse,—and he needs to be your best,—while I am writing.</p>
               <p>Jean Waldo asked nothing more but to he doing something, and at the word left the
                  room.</p>
               <p>The Florentine wrote:—</p>

               <p>Meanwhile the father had hurried down the dark passages, out into the court-yard,
                  past the workshops to the room where Hugh Prinhac, the most resolute of the
                  weavers, slept; a man who in street fights had again and again led the weavers'
                  apprentices in their victories over the dyers.</p>
               <p>He knocked at the door, and knocked again and again till he heard a motion within.
                  To a gruff "Who's there?" he gave his name in reply; and in an instant the
                  astonished journeyman threw the door open for his master.</p>
               <p>"Prinhac, my daughter is dying. The only man that can save her is this Italian,
                  who is only five hours away. Prinhac, as you love me, take this parchment, and
                  bring him."</p>
               <p>Prinhac was but half awake perhaps. The enterprise was not attractive, nor did it
                  seem as if his employer counted very wisely when he relied on such love as the
                  weaver bore him. Prinhac asked some hesitating question.</p>
               <p>"For the love of Christ, do not stay to argue," said the poor old man.</p>
               <p>Without knowing it, he struck a chord in using the sacred words, and in an instant
                  the weaver was ready for any duty. "Who stays to argue?" said he. "Do you see that
                  your black stallion is saddled, and by the time the horse is here, I will be ready
                  to mount. Love of Christ indeed! And who says I tarry when I am invoked IN HIS
                  NAME?"</p>

               <p>SURE enough, the weaver stood on the step of the door, booted and spurred, when
                  the trembling old man appeared with his lantern leading out Barbe-Noire from the
                  low gateway of the mews. It was long since Jean Waldo had saddled and bridled a
                  horse for himself, but he had not forgotten the arts of his boyhood, and the Arab
                  needed no care because his master was his groom. At the same moment Giulio the
                  Florentine appeared from above, and as Prinhac mounted promptly, Giulio put his
                  hand over the mane of the horse, and almost in a whisper, though they three were
                  all alone in the night, he gave the young fellow precise directions where and how
                  Lugio was to be found. Prinhac bent in the saddle, listened carefully, and
                  repeated the directions to be sure that he had not mistaken them.</p>
               <p>"Never fear me, then!" he said, spurred his horse, and was away.</p>
               <p>"He must cross the bridge before sundown," cried poor Jean Waldo to the rider,
                  himself startled as he remembered how narrow was the range thus given.</p>
               <p>"Never fear," was still the cheerful answer, and Prinhac disappeared into the
                  night.</p>
               <p>The ride across the narrow peninsula which parts the Saone from the Rhone, and is
                  to-day covered by the most beautiful part of the city of Lyons, took but a few
                  minutes,—and the rider was soon at the long, narrow bridge over the larger river,
                  which had been temporarily constructed, by the direction of Richard of the Lion
                  Heart, after the ruin of the year before. "The old man bids us return before
                  sunset. He has forgotten that I have started before sunrise." This was the thought
                  which amused Prinhac so that even a smile curled over his hard face as he rode up
                  to the gateway of the bridge.</p>
               <p>The truth was, that no passage was permitted before sunrise, under the sharp
                  orders of the Viguier. But many things were done in the priest-governed city of
                  Lyons, which neither Viguiers nor Seneschals nor Couriers nor the Chapter nor the
                  Bishop suspected. And this the reader will see.</p>
               <p>"Hola! Who commands the guard?" cried Prinhac. "Turn out! Turn out! Is this the
                  way our bridges are watched?"</p>
               <p>A sleepy sentinel appeared.</p>
               <p>"Hola! who commands the guard?" cried the fearless weaver again.</p>
               <p>"And what is that to you?" replied<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6581-00000012"/> plied
                  the sentinel, throwing his halberd forward in carte. "If you see the guard, it
                  ought to be enough for you."</p>
               <p>Prinhac did not stop to argue. But the sentinel, as he watched him in the dim
                  lantern-light, saw that he made in the air the sign of a Maltese Cross, and heard
                  him say, in a low whisper, "Send me the officer of the guard IN HIS NAME."</p>
               <p>Sign and whisper were enough. The sentry threw up his halberd in a military salute
                  and was gone. Nor did the rider wait a minute in the cold, before the officer of
                  the guard, fully dressed in armor, passed out from the gateway and saluted.</p>
               <p>"Can you let me pass, Mr. Officer?" said Prinhac, quietly and modestly this time.
                  "It is <emph>for the Love of Christ</emph> that I am riding."</p>
               <p>"Go—IN HIS NAME," Was the only reply made to the weaver. The officer turned,
                  passed into the guard-house, and, as if by invisible hand, the portcullis rose
                  before Prinhac, the only bar to his passage, and in a moment he was on the bridge.
                  The grate fell behind him, and he was again alone.</p>
               <p>"And how would my master have passed there?" he said to himself, half aloud. And
                  the same grim smile crept over his face,—"he should have asked his friend the
                  Bishop, or our distinguished boon companion the Seneschal, to give him a pass that
                  he might send into the mountains for the doctor they have driven away." And then
                  aloud, "Hist, hist, Barbe-Noire! You are not at Chateaudun; this is no
                  race-course. You shall have running enough before to-day is over. But in the dark,
                  over these rotten boats, you must step more carefully, my beauty."</p>
               <p>And so the rough fellow began musing on the strange chance which had put him
                  astride this horse, which, in the judgment of weavers, spinners, fullers, and
                  dyers, of the whole of the little community indeed which found its centre in Jean
                  Waldo's court-yard,—was by far the noblest horse in Lyons. Nor were they far from
                  right in their judgment. The noble creature had first appeared there when Jean
                  Waldo rode him back from a long absence in Marseilles. What price he had paid, or
                  what debts he had forgiven for him, no man in the workshops knew. But there were
                  rumors as to the wild life of the merchant who had been his last owner, and of
                  fight with the Barbary corsair who had been his master before. How these things
                  might be, Prinhac did not know. He did know that any groom who was permitted to
                  cross Barbe-Noire's saddle for an hour, would brag for a week of that honor, and
                  that, for his own part, he might the morning before as well have wished for the
                  crown of Burgundy, as to have wished for the permission to ride Barbe-Noire for a
                  day.</p>
               <p>And so the weaver was led on, as the horse took surer foothold on the causeway, to
                  ask himself why his master chose him from all workmen for this mission. Lucky for
                  Jean Waldo, the man thought it, that he chose as he did. "Which of them would have
                  seen that porteullis rise, as I did?" Ah, Prinhac, Prinhac Perhaps more of them
                  have the talisman than you think for!</p>
               <p>The truth was that when the Bishop John Fine-House,—Jean des Belles Maisons, as
                  some of the archives call him,—when John Fine-House, I say, or John Fine Hands, as
                  others call him, chose to banish Peter Waldo and the "Poor Men of Lyons" from his
                  city, he Strained his new-bought authority more harshly than he knew. When the
                  Archbishop and Chapter had refused to the Poor Men of Lyons the right to assemble
                  in the public places, or indeed anywhere, to read the gospels, they had themselves
                  possessed for only six years what they had long wished for, the temporal
                  government of the city and outlying country. Before the Pope of Rome had any such
                  power in Rome, the Archbishop of Lyons was as good as an independent Prince in
                  Lyons. In 1173 the Count of Forez and his son had sold out all their rights there,
                  in exchange for some lands owned by the Chapter, and eleven hundred marks of
                  money. The rulers of Burgundy had too little to do with such "Counties" to
                  interfere, and practically the Archbishop found himself a sovereign prince. The
                  town of Lyons became his fief, and all the administration was in his name.</p>
               <p>One of his first acts had been the prohibition of this nonsense about gospels and
                  charity and good works,—about translating the Scriptures, and assemblies of the
                  people to be addressed by laymen. "No Houses of Bread nor Houses of God, except
                  such as the Chapter builds!" And one of his first Victories was that which he won
                  over Pierre Waldo when he excommunicated him and his, and when the pope confirmed
                  the excommunication. For, only six years before, just as Fine-House was buying his
                  fief, Pope Alexander had embraced this barefoot beggar, and had approved his life
                  of voluntary poverty.</p>
               <p>But it was one thing to drive the merchant-preacher and his friends out of Lyons,
                  and another to make the people forget them. There were too many who had been fed
                  by their bounty, comforted by their sympathy, and taught by their zeal, who were
                  too insignificant for exile, but were too grateful to forget. The weaver Prinhac
                  was one of these; and by the secret signals which they had established among
                  themselves, he knew that many of the men-at-arms of the Chapter thought as he
                  thought and felt as he felt. It was his confidence in their help which had brought
                  him out over the bridge so easily.</p>
               <p>But in truth Jean Waldo had chosen him only because he had seen that he was quick
                  as a flash and faltered at nothing. It had been, alas, not from any deep religious
                  feeling, but from the agony of despair, that Jean Waldo had summoned the young
                  athlete to rise, "for the love of Christ." The man had replied to the summons so
                  fortunately made, with the reply which, to one initiated into the mysteries of
                  these "poor men," would have shown that he was one who was loyally tied to the
                  teachers and friends who had done so much for Lyons, and were exiled from their
                  homes. But Jean Waldo was not initiated, and he had no suspicion that he had made
                  a choice so happy as he had when he sent Prinhac upon his errand.</p>
               <p>Prinhac and Barbe-Noire crossed the causeway more slowly than either of them
                  liked, but as fast as the rider dared to go over an icy road in the darkness. As
                  day began to break at last, they came to a point for which Giulio's directions had
                  not prepared him. He had crossed the river again. The valley road, which in our
                  time is the road always travelled, was<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6581-00000013"/>
                  but a half-broken way, little better than a foot-path. The beaten track turned to
                  the left and boldly pushed up the steep hill. The foot-path was stolen from the
                  edge of the hill, which here crowds close upon the Rhone. Still, though it was
                  narrow, and though, clearly enough, a block of ice from the river or of rock from
                  the cliff might easily make it impassable, it was so much more level and so much
                  more direct than the hill road, that Prinhac would have been glad to choose it.
                  But he did not dare, without better authority than his own guess or wish.</p>
               <p>A miserable turf hovel stood some hundred yards back from the way he had been
                  following, on a steep slope of the hill. Unwilling to lose an instant, the young
                  man still forced Barbe-Noire, who seemed as unwilling as himself, across the
                  little turnip-patch, and bringing the horse close to the very door itself, knocked
                  loud enough to waken Ogier the Dane.</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>Prinhac knocked again and again, It was no deserted hovel, he knew that; and he
                  meant that no one there should sleep later that morning.</p>
               <p>To the fourth knock, the squeaking voice of an old woman answered: "Who is
                  there?"</p>
               <p>"O," said the rider, laughing, "you have turned over in the bed, have you? I am a
                  courier from Lyons, and I want to know which is my best way to Meximieux."</p>
               <p>"Both are the best—both are the best. Go your way, and do not be waking honest
                  people at midnight!"</p>
               <p>Prinhac had played on a word in calling himself a courier. A courier was indeed a
                  carrier of messages, and it was true that he was carrying a message; but in the
                  phrase of the time, a "courier" in Lyons corresponded to what we now call a
                  prosecuting attorney, and Prinhac had had the hope that he might frighten the old
                  crone into an answer. But he reckoned quite without his host. The truth was, that
                  she did not know the word in either of its meanings. She only guessed that here
                  was some roysterer who was to be kept at bay, and answered as best she could, with
                  the object of getting rid of him.</p>
               <p>Prinhac waited a moment, but found he was to get no other answer. He knocked again
                  and again, but there was no answer. It was half unconsciously that he said then,
                  in no loud tone, "For the love of Christ, will no one show me the way?"</p>
               <p>And the answer was as prompt as his own had been to Jean Waldo. The shutter of the
                  hovel was thrown open wide. A man thrust half his body out from the window.</p>
               <p>"Who pleads the love of Christ? If you have all day before you, take the valley;
                  but you take the chances of having to return. If your errand is haste, take the
                  hill road. Trust me, for I speak it IN HIS NAME."</p>
               <p>The rider nodded, made the Cross of Malta in the air, pushed his horse down to the
                  roadway again, and began the tedious ascent of the hill.</p>
               <p>As he rose from the fog of the valley, he turned uneasily in his saddle and looked
                  back once and again to be sure what was the prospect of the weather now sunrise
                  drew near. For if this day were to be stormy, if the hill paths were to be blocked
                  or obscured by never so little freshly-fallen snow, little hope was there that the
                  priest-doctor for whom he was sent would ever see little Félicie alive. Prinhac
                  was of a hopeful mood. But he found it hard to read the signs of the times in that
                  early morning, hard indeed to persuade himself that the rifted clouds which were
                  beginning to catch their glory of purple and gold from the sun still concealed,
                  were only to be painted clouds that day, and that there was no malice behind them.
                  "The mountain will tell me," said Prinhac. "If, when I have passed the castle
                  gate, I see the white mountain, I will lay a wager on the day; but if there are as
                  heavy clouds before me as there are behind, it must go hard with poor Mademoiselle
                  Félicie."</p>
               <p>And they toiled up the broken hill, Prinhac and the horse. Prinhac was not too
                  lazy nor too proud to save his horse, even at this early hour, as best he might.
                  At the heaviest ascent, he was off the saddle and walked by the noble creature's
                  side, only playing with the thick and heavy black mane, which had given to him his
                  name. Then, without waiting for stirrups, he was on his back again, and he
                  indulged Barbe-Noire in a little gallop as they crossed the flat which is
                  commanded by the castle.</p>
               <p>The heavy square tower of the castle seemed completely to block the way. But
                  Prinhac advanced, nothing faltering,—rode close along the wall, turned it, and
                  opened on a vision of wonder such as he never looked upon before.</p>
               <p>The hill which he had been mounting commands from its highest ridge a marvellous
                  view of the valley of the Rhone. Far beneath him lay the winding course of the
                  river, flowing between fields which were this morning white with hoar-frost. The
                  blue of the Rhone and the white of the frost both revealed themselves to him
                  through the exquisite purple mist which even at this hour was beginning to rise
                  from the meadows. Like islands through this mist, Prinhac could see one and
                  another village,—here a tower, and there a square castle,—he could see the spires
                  of Lhuis and St. Laurent, and far away Arandon. But he did not pause to look or to
                  wonder. He pressed his horse to the point where the prospect opens most to the
                  eastward, and there, against the purple and the gold of the sunrise,—the sun
                  himself not having struggled yet above the mountains,—there he saw the monarch of
                  them all, lying purple-gray against this blazing background, without one filled of
                  cloud across his face, nor a wreath of mist rising from his valleys.</p>
               <p>The weaver accepted the signal he had been longing for. "Ah, Monsieur Mont Blanc!"
                  he said aloud, "you are a good friend to my Mistress Félicie this day."</p>
               <p>How little the good fellow thought that as lately as sunset on the evening before,
                  his young "mistress" had been throwing her kisses from the hill of Fourvières over
                  to her "dear old friend."</p>
               <p>And now he and Barbe-Noire were fairly in for their work. More than two hours had
                  passed since he crept out of Lyons in the darkness, and daylight must make up for
                  the time which had been lost in the creeping. Barbe-Noire was as glad as he for
                  the right to take a quicker pace,—and now began the real triumph of blood and good
                  temper and good breeding. It was not long that the road held the high ground. As
                  the sun at last rose glorious behind the Alps themselves and the thousand ranges
                  of castlellated mountains which lay against the heavy line of the Alps,<pb
                     n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6581-00000014"/> the descent into the valley again began.
                  The rider looked his last on Félicie's old friend, and let his faithful horse take
                  as fast a pace as he dared in the descent. Once on the flats again, their pace was
                  like flying. The country children on their way to morning mass looked with wonder,
                  and indeed with terror, as they saw this coal-black horse, with nostrils open and
                  eyes of fire, dash by them. The rider was no knight, they could see that. But not
                  even when the knights from Burgundy came through to join in the crusade had these
                  children seen such a horse or such a rider. So Prinhac passed village after
                  village, group after group of churchgoers, and began to feel that his work was
                  more certain of success than he had feared, and that he should find the hidden
                  doctor, as he must find him, before noon of that day. If only back in the hills
                  there were any horse to bring the doctor back who could compare with this brave
                  Barbe-Noire!</p>
               <p>Ah, Prinhac! ah, Prinhac! What says the Scripture? "The race is not to the swift
                  nor the battle to the strong." As he was passing through the little hamlet of
                  Dagnien, nodding good-naturedly to a group of frightened children, who were
                  huddling together by the hedge that they might be out of his way, Barbe-Noire trod
                  with his forefoot on a sheet of ice, disguised under a cloud of slime which had
                  flowed down on it the day before. The horse slipped, tried to rally, and lost the
                  regularity of his pace; slipped again, brought up his hind feet on the same
                  treacherous ice, and before his master could draw foot from stirrup, horse and
                  rider had fallen heavily upon the stones of the wayside.</p>
               <p>Prinhac uttered no sound. But he was fettered for the moment beneath the weight of
                  the horse and was powerless. Poor Barbe-Noire did his best—his very best. Is the
                  poor fellow maimed? That was Prinhac's first thought,—whether he himself were
                  maimed would appear afterwards.</p>
               <p>Then he made outcry enough to call to his aid, first a frightened girl, and then
                  her brothers, and then every man and woman of the wretched hamlet. Barbe-Noire had
                  in the mean while struggled to his feet. But Barbe-Noire would never bear rider
                  again. In that cruel fall the horse's slender fore-leg had broken just above the
                  fetlock; and though Prinhac and the rest tried to persuade themselves that this
                  was but a sprain, every effort the poor beast made was more painful to see, and it
                  needed only the most tender touch at the place where the bone was broken, to know
                  that the calamity could never be cured.</p>
               <p>For poor Prinhac himself the fall had been as hard. "I would not say a word," he
                  said, "if the horse could only move." But whether he chose to say a word or no.
                  none the less was it clear that his left shoulder on which he had fallen was
                  powerless. The truth was, that his arm had been wrenched from its socket by the
                  blow.</p>
               <p>The peasants were stupid, but were kind. One and all they offered such help as
                  they could, and suggested this and that cabin as open to Prinhac till the priest
                  could be sent for; or at Balan below there was a famous farrier. If the gentleman
                  wished, Ode, here, should be sent on the gray mare for him. But Prinhac listened
                  with little favor to any talk of the priest, nor did he seem to care much for the
                  farrier. "This is what I want, my brave friends," he said. "I want to send a bit
                  of vellum as big as your two fingers to the doctor who is in the hills beyond
                  Rambert de Joux. It is not three hours' ride. Who will go there?"</p>
               <p>Stupidly they all listened, and no one answered. There was a look of inquiry which
                  passed from each to each which would have been droll were not the occasion so
                  serious. It seemed to say: "Is the man a simpleton, or does he think we are
                  simpletons?"</p>
               <p>"Fifty sols in silver," said Prinhac, cheerfully, "to the man who will take this
                  bit of paper to the charcoal-burner Mark of Seyssel. Who is the man, or who is the
                  pretty girl that will do it?" as his eye fell on a sunburned maiden. "Fifty sols
                  to a man, or sixty to a girl."</p>
               <p>But they stood as if he spoke Hebrew to them, and neither girl nor man
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"Is there nobody," said Prinhac, discouraged more by his failure than his
                  pain,—"nobody who is willing to save a dying woman's life for the love of
                  Christ?"</p>
               <p>"You should have asked that before!" said a tall, lithe man, speaking in the
                  purest Romance. He had seemed perfectly indifferent, even unconscious, until he
                  heard these last words. "You should have asked that before. Antoine, Marie, take
                  these brats home. Paul, Jean, Pierre, the whole troop of you, lead this poor beast
                  to the priest's house, and groom him well. Felix, show the gentleman the way to
                  Our Lady's stile. Then he turned to Prinhac,—</p>
               <p>"This is a noble horse, my friend, who has borne you well; but the Arab who is to
                  take me to your doctor, can give minutes to any beast in the Abbot's stables, and
                  shall still win the crown. You will find me at Our Lady's stile, ready to serve
                  you,—'IN HIS NAME.'"</p>
               <p>Sure enough, when poor Prinhac, who walked stoutly and stiffly, leaning his whole
                  weight, as it seemed, on the shoulder of this willing Felix,—when he came to Our
                  Lady's stile, here was his new friend mounted on a noble Arab, of the breed which
                  at that time was just finding its way into Southern France from the ports of the
                  southern shore. Prinhac took from his pocket the precious missive, and whispered
                  to the workman the directions he had received from Giulio the Florentine. The
                  villager had a little switch in his hand with which he marked in the air the sign
                  of the Cross of Malta. The poor, faint weaver did the same with his finger; and
                  they parted, the one for his quick ride, the other for such comfort as he could
                  find in the cabin of Pierre Boronne.</p>

               <head type="sub">LOST AND FOUND.</head>
               <p>GUALTIER of the Mill knew every inch of the way before him, knew where and how to
                  spare his horse, where to take a short cut by ways known to scarcely any except
                  the charcoal-burners, where to ford a stream, and how to save a hill. So far he
                  had the advantage for this service of poor Prinhac, whose zeal had cost him so
                  dearly. And Gualtier of the Mill trusted more openly to the talisman which they
                  had both<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6581-00000015"/> been using. As be worked his way
                  into the mountains, he had less fear of any spies or tip-staves of the Bishop and
                  his crew, and did not hesitate to show the flag under which he served. It happened
                  to him, as it happened to Prinhac, to come upon one of the draw-bridges which so
                  often held the roadway where it crossed a stream. But the moment Gualtier appeared
                  on the height above, it was enough for him to mark in the air with the sign of the
                  Cross of Malta, and the attendants of the bridge, some sort of rural gens-d' armes
                  known in those days, ran to let it down for the rider, who acknowledged the
                  courtesy as he passed, by saying, gently, "It is for the love of Christ," and
                  received, as he knew he should, the countersign, "And IN HIS NAME." The road
                  became more and more hilly, but in an hour he had made more than three good
                  leagues, and he came upon the picturesque height of Meximieux just as the people
                  from village and from castle had poured into the church for the Sunday service of
                  the day.</p>
               <p>Gualtier looked round him and saw no man. He rode to the church door, swung
                  himself from the horse, which he left wholly unfastened, and entered in the midst
                  of the assembly, who were upon their knees. Gualtier knelt also, and joined in the
                  devotions; but at the first change in the order of the service, he noted one
                  worshipper whose white head was still hidden in his hands, bent over him, and
                  whispered "For the Love of Christ." The old man rose without a word, and they left
                  the church together. A moment's conference, and he bade Gualtier wait for him
                  where the road turns from the stable-gate of the castle, he swung himself over the
                  hedge-stile and was gone. Gualtier of the Mill walked his horse to the fork in the
                  road which had been indicated, and at the same moment the gray-haired villager was
                  there with the best horse from the Baron's stable. Gualtier left his own in his
                  care, saluted as before, and was gone. "It is IN HIS NAME," said his new-found
                  friend.</p>
               <p>Two hours from Meximieux with riding so fast should have brought him to the
                  charcoal-burner's but which had been indicated all along as the station at which
                  he was aiming. But these were no longer ways for travellers. They were only the
                  paths that fagot-makers or charcoal-burners had made for their convenience between
                  rocks, bushes, and trees, and which at their convenience they neglected again.
                  Gualtier of the Mill used his sense as long as any man's sense could save him at
                  all. He chose such paths as led a little south of east, as he had been bidden. He
                  got a glimpse now and then of the stronghold above Rossillon, passed as he was
                  bidden, the castle of Vieux-Mount-Ferrand; but at last, in a tangle of low,
                  scrubby oaks, and amid piles of rocks which seemed to have been hurled together in
                  some play of ogres, no path looked promising among the sheep-tracks and the traces
                  of the feet of the asses and mules, from whose charcoal loads the litter still
                  strewed the ground.</p>
               <p>Gualtier of the Mill stopped, fairly confounded. He blew a shrill whistle, and had
                  no answer. He dropped his reins on the neck of his horse, and his horse stood
                  still. He faithfully tried the pathway which seemed to trend most to the castward,
                  and it led him in fifty yards distance to the place where chips on the ground
                  showed that the wood-cutters had taken out some saplings there, and had gone no
                  farther. He came back to the "abomination of desolation," as it seemed to him, sat
                  undecided, though he knew indecision was ruin, and it seemed to him a voice from
                  heaven when he heard the loud laugh of a little child.</p>
               <p>In an instant the child was hushed, and all was still again. But the sound was
                  enough for Gualtier of the Mill. He pushed his horse to the place it came from,
                  through a close thicket of tangled cedars which he had refused to try before, and
                  after a steep descent came out on a group of a dozen frightened children by the
                  side of a brook. They had been at play there, had heard his horse's footsteps, and
                  had been frightened into silence by the sound. For in the lawlessness of those
                  times, the havoc made by everybody who rode on horseback, whether he rated himself
                  as knight, squire, man-at-arms, or highwayman, was such that peasant children like
                  these, in such a wilderness as this, had much the same notion of such travellers
                  as had the old crone whom Prinhac had summoned in the early morning. And so the
                  older brothers and sisters of this group had been trying to keep the little ones
                  silent till the horseman should go by.</p>
               <p>Gualtier of the Mill drew up his horse when he saw the pretty company, and in a
                  cheerful way said, "Who is playing fox and goose here?" And the little children
                  hid behind the bigger ones, and the bigger ones hung their heads, and said
                  nothing.</p>
               <p>"And which of you can tell me the way to the house of Mark of Seyssel, where the
                  road from Culoz comes in?"</p>
               <p>The little children hid behind the bigger ones, and the bigger ones hung their
                  heads, as before.</p>
               <p>"Now I really hoped," said the good-natured miller, "I really hoped I had found
                  one of Mark's little girls; and I really hoped she would show me the way. At my
                  home I have four girls and five boys, and they all know all the sheep-tracks and
                  all the horse-tracks. And when Father Antony comes and says, 'Who will mount my
                  mule and show me the way?' Why Jean runs, and Gertrude runs, and Antoine runs, and
                  Marie runs, and all of them want to show him."</p>
               <p>The miller understood the way to children's hearts. But these children had been
                  trained to hold their peace among strangers. More than once, as the older of them
                  knew, had life depended on their discretion; and so stolid were their faces as
                  Gualtier of the Mill tried his seductions, that even he was deceived. He fairly
                  thought they did not know what the words meant which he was speaking.</p>
               <p>He drew from his pocket the silver whistle which he had blown just before. He
                  sprang from his horse, and lot the creature go at large. He sat down on the ground
                  by the youngest child, and with the whistle, which was a flageolet indeed, of the
                  range of a few notes, played, for the child's amusement, a little air; and then
                  taking the little thing upon his knee, tried if he would not take the plaything.
                  The child seemed to dread the reproof of the older children, but the bauble was
                  too tempting to be resisted; and when the pipe gave out a shrill, sharp sound at
                  his effort, the little thing laughed and became more fearless, and seemed more
                  willing to be won. Gualtier followed up his victory; and in the rough dialect of
                  the Dauphin Mountains, which he spoke as easily as the Provençal in<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000016"/> which he had been talking, he said again,—</p>
               <p>"It is Mark of Seyssel, the charcoal merchant, whom I want to find. Mark of
                  Seyssel has some good little girls. Do you not know his little girls? I have a
                  bright silver sol here for each of them."</p>
               <p>You are a cunning fowler, Gualtier, and you are a keen fisherman. But here are
                  fish who will not bite at every bait. It is one of Mark's little boys whom you
                  have upon your knee. And that tall, brave child, whose hair is braided in with a
                  strip of red ribbon, is one of his girls. But they know too well that they are to
                  say nothing of roads unless they know they speak to friends. And not a flash of
                  intelligence passes from one heavy eye to another.</p>
               <p>Then the miller wondered if perhaps these oldest children, wise as he saw them to
                  be, had been trusted with secrets more precious than the mere guarding of a
                  roadway. Still speaking in the mountain dialect, he said, as if he were speaking
                  to the wind, without addressing one child more than another, "This is life and
                  death for which I am travelling. A dear, loving girl will die this night, if,
                  before the sun is at noon, I do not find the house of Mark of Seyssel. I wonder if
                  any one could show me his house if I asked for the LOVE OF CHRIST?"</p>
               <p>The brown-haired girl, and the stupid boy, and the other boy who held the long,
                  peeled rod, and the other tall girl who had a baby in her arms—all started at the
                  spell. The first of the four spoke in Provençal, and said, "I will lead you gladly
                  to my father's, now I know you come IN HIS NAME."</p>
               <p>And in a minute more he was in the saddle again; the child was sitting across it
                  before him, he was pushing through this tangle and over that ford, scrambling up a
                  hill-side, and then threading a low growth of under brush, till in less than a
                  mile from the point where he had lost himself, the girl found voice again; and,
                  speaking in Provençal as before, said, "There is my father's storehouse." And as
                  she pointed, on the other side of a little clearing in the forest, he saw a rough
                  cabin, built half of logs and half of rough stones. From a hole in the roof, quite
                  too large, and indeed of too little architectural form, to be called a chimney, a
                  volume of smoke was pouring. Without this token, indeed, the loud voices of the
                  men within would have taught the traveller that the charcoal-burner's but was not
                  deserted.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CHARCOAL-BURNER.</head>
               <p>THE science of the iron forges in the valley below had already reached some work
                  so fine that the workmen there had instructed the peasants of the hills, and sent
                  them to a separate industry of burning and packing pine, chestnut, and oak
                  charcoal, to be used in the manufacture of the finer steels. Many a man who was
                  part hunter and part shepherd was willing to provide himself with his salt, with a
                  few nails, with iron heads to his arrows, and with better pipkins and mugs than
                  they baked in the mountains, by answering the demand. The rough fellows had found,
                  however, that it was better to make but one business of their trade with the iron
                  and steel men; and so now, for a generation and more, this rough cabin, where Mark
                  of Seyssel now presided, had become a rendezvous for the charcoal-burners, and
                  they had been in the habit of storing here the full bags in which they had packed
                  their coals ready for the mules.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the cabin or hut, on an open place for fire, there were piled a
                  dozen great logs, which made a cheerful point of union for the group, and from
                  which, through a great, square hole in the roof, passed out the weird column of
                  smoke which first caught the eye of the traveller. Around this, sitting and lying
                  in every possible attitude, was the company of the lazy peasants, getting rid of
                  the winter day as best they could.</p>
               <p>"If you ever see Lambert this side of purgatory, call me a liar. When I saw him
                  cross the old bay, with his new baldric on him, I said, 'Good-by, Lambert, we
                  shall never meet again.' And I said it because I knew it."</p>
               <p>"But why do you know it, and how do you know it?" persisted the man with whom the
                  speaker was talking. He sat shaping a bow, and letting the shavings of ash fall
                  upon the live coals, as he made them. "How do you know it? Here at Blon I talked
                  with the innkeeper, with all the grooms, and with Sirand himself. They all said
                  that the Saracens would not stand the first battle with our men. They said there
                  would be a new king at Jerusalem before Easter; and that long, before another
                  Christmas the Bishop would be at Lyons again, King Philip in Paris, King Richard
                  in England; and by the same token the count will be in his castle, and Lambert and
                  Raymond and Forney and all the boys would be back here, with shells on their hats,
                  and with gold in their pockets."</p>
               <p>"Much does Sirand know." retorted the implacable grumbler, who began: "Has he
                  talked with the Saracens? Has their famous king, the Lord Saladin, told him that
                  they were all going to run away at the first battle? Has he been to see Jerusalem,
                  that he thinks it a summer day's journey to go there? As for the innkeeper at
                  Blon, the man is a fool. The last time I was there, he would have persuaded me to
                  my face that I did not know a walnut bow from one made of ash. I wish he may be
                  choked with his own porridge. And if his grooms know no more of Saladin's men than
                  they know of Frenchmen's horses, their talk is not worth retailing. I tell you it
                  is a fool's errand they have all gone upon, and you will never see Lambert's face
                  again."</p>
               <p>"Is it a fool's errand," struck in a little, lame man who sat on the other side of
                  the fire, so that the two could hardly see him, "to redeem the grave of our
                  blessed Lord, and our blessed Lady, his mother, and of more saints than I could
                  name or you can count, from these misbegotten dogs, heathen and sons of heathen?
                  Did you hear the father tell how they flayed alive that poor Mary of Picardy when
                  she went on a pilgrimage? Did you hear him tell how they built their cursed fire
                  against St. Joseph's tomb, and cracked the columns, and heaved dirt upon the
                  stone? Fool's errand indeed! It's well for them to call it a fool's errand who
                  stay idling here at home. But had I two feet to walk, or a leg<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000017"/> to cross a mule, I would not be hanging round here,
                  throwing shame on better men."</p>
               <p>"Limping Pierre," replied the other, good-naturedly, "I have heard you say that
                  thing before, or what came to the same end; and, if you choose, you may say it
                  seven times more, nay, seventy times seven, as the gospel says, and I will never
                  quarrel with as good a fellow as you are. But two things you know and I know: one
                  is, that Ambrose cared no more for our Lady nor for St. Joseph's tomb than he
                  cared for the snow on the top of the mountain, nor would he go one step of his
                  lazy life to save them both from pollution. He went because he saw the others go,
                  and he chose to be fed without working, and to sleep on linen that other men's
                  wives had woven. He thought he should come back with gold he had not earned, and
                  should hector over you and me and other honest people because he had a shell in
                  his hat-band. As for making war upon people because they are dogs and the sons of
                  dogs, because their prayers are false, and their lives mean,—why we might make war
                  on the Bishop and Chapter of Lyons for quite as good cause as they have to make
                  war on King Saladin and his Emirs, if that happens to be his name."</p>
               <p>The bold effrontery of the allusion to the bishop and chapter was welcomed by a
                  guffaw of laughter from some of the lazy throng; but others fairly started, not so
                  much in anger as in terror. "Keep a civil tongue in your head, Matthew, or it will
                  be the worse for all of us. There is treason enough and heresy enough talked in
                  this store to give all the hamlets over to the Couriers, and we may be sent
                  a-begging before we know it with our wives and our children."</p>
               <p>But to this protest Mark of Seyssel himself made answer, speaking for the first
                  time:—</p>
               <p>"Jean Fisherman, if you do not like the talk here, you need not stay here. If you
                  have any gossip to retail to the Courier or the Viguier you had better go and
                  retail it, and good riddance to you. I am master of this hovel, and it is my
                  castle; when I am afraid of my guests, I will turn them out-doors. Till I am
                  afraid of them, they will not check each other's talk. For my own part," said the
                  burly collier. "I am quite of black-eyed Matt's mind, and I drink his very good
                  health. When the pot is white, it may scold the kettle for being black; but while
                  the priests and the abbots send men from their homes because they feed the poor,
                  when they take their houses and steal their goods to make themselves comfortable,
                  why, if they do go to the Holy Land with his Grace the King and his Holiness the
                  Bishop, I am afraid they will carry no better Gospel than they left behind. For my
                  part I wish I could see men here live as the saints lived, before they go to whip
                  the Saracens into living so," And the stout collier took from the settle by him a
                  tankard from which he had been drinking, passed it to black-eyed Matthew, as he
                  called the bow-maker, and bade him give to the others to drink in their turn.</p>
               <p>It was just as he had done this, that there was heard at the heavy doorway the
                  sharp rap of the handle of Gualtier's riding-whip, and on the instant the
                  charcoal-burner bade him enter. The man seemed a little surprised at the sight of
                  his own daughter with the stranger. The child clearly felt that her duty was done.
                  She dropped a courtesy, and was off to the shelter of the shrubbery in an instant.
                  The collier offered Gualtier a seat by the fire. But the whole assembly was
                  hushed, so that no one would have guessed that they were all in talk so eager only
                  the moment before.</p>
               <p>"Are you Mark the collier?" said the messenger. "I am told that you can direct me
                  to the house of Father Jean of Lugio."</p>
               <p>"Eh?" was the only reply of the stout collier, who but just now was so voluble,
                  and was defending so voluble, and was defending so volubly the sacred rights of
                  volubility in others.</p>
               <p>"I have been riding, at my best, to find Father Jean of Lugio. I am told he makes
                  his home in these parts. And he is needed, sorely needed, to-day in Lyons. I have
                  a message for him here."</p>
               <p>"Eh?" was the grunt again, which the fuller explanation extorted from the collier.
                  Gualtier was surprised. He had never seen this man, but he had not supposed him to
                  be an idiot. And he had certainly supposed that a person who transacted so much
                  business in the valley would have some knowledge of the Provençal. But he repeated
                  his explanation, and more at length, in the hill dialect, in which he had spoken
                  to the collier's children.</p>
               <p>"Eh?" was the stupid reply as before. But then the clown looked up heavily upon
                  the others, and in the same language said, "Boys, do you hear what the gentleman
                  says? Do any of you know anything of this Jean of Lugio, this father whom he has
                  come to see?"</p>
               <p>The men looked stupidly upon each other, as if they could not understand this
                  dialect any more than he could understand the Provençal of the miller.</p>
               <p>Gualtier looked round to see if one face were any more intelligent than the
                  others. Then he took from his pocket six or eight pieces of silver, tossed them in
                  the air, and caught them again in his hand. Speaking in the same dialect he said,
                  "These are for any good fellow who will go to the house of the father for me; and
                  here are as many more for any one who comes back with him." But a dead, stupid
                  wonder, which hardly counted for curiosity, was the only emotion which seemed to
                  be aroused, even by this unwonted display. Gualtier of the Mill felt as if, even
                  at the last moment, he was foiled. "A tall man," he said, "with a tonsure, and the
                  hair around it, as white as snow. He bends a little as he walks, he is so tall; he
                  favors his right foot in walking."</p>
               <p>"Eh?" from Mark of Seyssel, was the only answer.</p>
               <p>Gualtier was provoked with himself that he had not kept the child. The child at
                  least could speak, and could understand. It seemed to him that of the group of
                  idlers there was not one, no, not the stout head of the castle himself, who seemed
                  to take the least interest in his mission. Far less could they help him, if they
                  had chosen.</p>
               <p>Provoked with himself for letting the child go, he walked again to the door to see
                  if he could trace her; but she was out of sight long ago. He turned back, and the
                  others were sitting as stolidly as he found them. On the instant, however, the
                  inspiration came to him, and he saw that the talisman by which he had succeeded
                  with her might be as effective with these churls. In truth, the dulness of the men
                  had entirely deceived him. He had lost his presence of mind, and was fairly
                  confused by the charcoal-dealer's well-acted stupidity. As Gualtier closed the
                  door again,<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6581-00000018"/> he took up a bit of charcoal
                  from the floor, and, as if to amuse himself in a careless habit, on the door
                  itself drew roughly a Roman cross, of which the vertical line was not longer than
                  the cross bar, and then with a few touches improved upon it till it became the
                  Cross of Malta, with its sharp points and re-entering angles at each
                  extremity.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Beneath the cross he wrote in Latin the two words. "Amore Christi."</p>
               <p>Before he had finished the inscription, the bow-maker had risen from the ground
                  and was putting on his outer jerkin, as if to leave the fire. Two others of the
                  idlers, also, seemed to have done all they had to do in the cabin, and made as if
                  they were going away. Mark of Seyssel himself said aloud. "It's nigh to noon, and
                  I shall sit here no longer. If François, comes bid him ask the old woman where I
                  am." So saying he brushed out by Gualtier, and as he opened the door, said to him,
                  "Come away from them into the air." As the miller followed him, he led the way
                  apart from ear-shot in the house, and said, "You should have made some signal
                  before. There are men in that hut that would gladly put the Father in irons, and
                  throw him into the lake of Bourget. But you can trust me, and indeed more than me,
                  if you come IN HIS NAME."</p>
               <p>Then Gualtier told the awakened savage who he was, and why he came; that he had in
                  his hand what he was told it was of the first importance that the Father should
                  know that he had been bid to bring this missive:—"For the love of Christ," and
                  that he had agreed to do so, "IN HIS NAME." He told Mark of Seyssel that as token
                  of his truth, he would trust the parchment to him, and that he might carry it to
                  the master's hiding-place; that the master then could make his own choice whether
                  to come or to refuse. "Only this I know, said the miller, "that if he do not show
                  himself at this spot ready to mount my horse here when the sun is at noon, I see
                  no use of his coming here at all; for the order is that he is to cross the bridge
                  at Lyons before the sun goes down. You know, my friend," said he, "that he is a
                  brave horseman who makes that distance in that time."</p>
               <p>The collier hurried away. The rider returned into the hut and threw himself on the
                  ground by Jean the fisherman. Jean was anxious enough to try to find out who the
                  stranger was, and to learn more of the errand on which he had come; but Gualtier
                  was as shrewd as he was, parried question with question, and for an hour the group
                  was as much in doubt as when he found them as to his business. He had sense enough
                  to produce a flask of wine from behind the saddle of his horse, and offered this
                  in token of good fellowship to the company. They talked about the frost, about the
                  freshet, about the price of coal, about the new mines of iron; and they had
                  approached the central subject of the great crusade again, when Mark of Seyssel
                  again entered the smoky cabin.</p>
               <p>He took the place he had left by the fire, and said to the miller, "I have given
                  to your horse all the oats I had, and he has eaten them all." He said this
                  gruffly; and those who were not in the secret might well imagine, as he meant they
                  should, that his interview with the stranger had related chiefly to his horse's
                  welfare. Gualtier thanked him with the good nature he had shown all along, counted
                  out copper enough to pay for the oats, bade the party good-by, and said he would
                  go farther on his journey. He crossed the opening to the place where the horse was
                  tethered, and there under the juniper-tree to which he was fastened, he found, as
                  he had hoped to find, Father Jean of Lugio.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">JOHN OF LUGIO.</head>
               <p>JOHN OF LUGIO is one of the men who did the world service wellnigh inestimable in
                  his day, and who is to-day by the world at large, forgotten. When one reads in the
                  Epistle to the Hebrews of men who had trial of mockings and scourgings, of bonds
                  and imprisonments; who were destitute, afflicted, tormented; who wandered in
                  deserts and mountains and dens and caves of the earth,—"of whom the world was not
                  worthy,"—one ought to remember for a moment that he owes it to a few groups of
                  just such men, one of whom was this forgotten John of Lugio, that he is able to
                  read those words at all, or is indeed permitted to do so.</p>
               <p>When Peter Waldo, the prosperous merchant of Lyons, was first awakened to the
                  value of the gospel for all men around him, and saw their ignorance of it as well,
                  he gave himself and his means not only to feeding the hungry and finding homes for
                  the homeless, but to wayside instruction in the words of Christ. He found one and
                  another version of parts of the Old and New Testament in the Romance language. The
                  very oldest specimen of that language which we have to-day is a paraphrase, of a
                  generation or two before Peter Waldo's time, of the Bible History. It is known by
                  the name of the "Noble Lesson." The troubadours, whom we are wont to think of as
                  mere singers of love songs and romances, were in those days quite as apt to sing
                  these sacred songs, and they carried from place to place a more distinct knowledge
                  of the Bible stories than the people gained in churches.</p>
               <p>Peter Waldo undertook to improve the popular knowledge of the Bible thus gained.
                  This was an important part of his enterprise. He had himself a sufficient
                  knowledge of Latin to read the Latin Vulgate. To translate this into the language
                  of Provence, he gained the assistance of three intelligent priests, all of them in
                  office in Lyons. They were Bernard of Ydros, Stephen of Empsa, and John of Lugio,
                  with whom the reader is now to become acquainted. Neither of the three supposed
                  that there was anything exceptional in their enterprise, as how should they? They
                  and their friend were at work to teach the common people the "Word of God" more
                  simply and perfectly, and what better could they do? Of the three, Stephen
                  undertook the work of translation especially; John examined the other translations
                  and compared them with Stephen's,—he studied the critics, sought in every
                     direction<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6581-00000019"/> the best authorities, and
                  made this new Bible of the people as perfect as careful scholarship and the best
                  learning of the time could do. Bernard took the more humble part of transcribing
                  the text agreed upon,—more humble but not less important. Probably a careful
                  explorer in the old convent libraries of the South of France might now find his
                  patient manuscripts, even after the ruthless destruction wrought by the
                  persecutors of that century and the century which followed. When Peter Waldo made
                  his journey to Rome, to ask for the benediction of the Pope on their labors, one
                  or all of these men probably accompanied him. As has been said already, the Pope
                  was only too glad to find that such assistance in the organization of religion was
                  raised up among the laymen of Lyons. The scheme prepared was very much like that
                  which St. Francis proposed only a few years later; where it differed from his, it
                  differed in a more broad and generous understanding of the needs of the great body
                  of the people.</p>
               <p>If only the bishop and chapter of Lyons had been equal to the exigency! But, alas,
                  they were not equal to it. To them the great reality of religion was their
                  newly-bought temporal power over the city and country. The interference of
                  merchants, whether as almoners or as lay readers in the affairs of the city, was
                  no part of their plan. They had not bought out the Count of Forez, and freed
                  themselves from his dictation, to be dictated to now by a set of fanatics within
                  their own wall. They therefore, as has been said, refused all approval to the
                  far-seeing plans of Peter Waldo; they excommunicated him and his, confiscated
                  their property, and drove them from their homes.</p>
               <p>Such crises try men's souls, and it is from such fires that tempered metal only
                  comes out uninjured. Of the four men who had worked together in the distribution
                  of the new Bible, two were taken and two were left. Peter Waldo endured the loss
                  of all things, travelled over the world of Europe, and left everywhere his great
                  idea of a Bible for the people, and of a church in which layman as well as priest
                  was a minister to God. Bernard and Stephen could not stand the test. They made
                  their peace with the authorities of the Lyonese church, and no man knows their
                  after history. John of Lugio, whom we ask the reader of these lines to remember
                  among the men of whom the world of his own time was not worthy, never turned back
                  from the plough. He had consecrated his life to this idea of a free Bible. To this
                  idea he gave his life. It would be hard to name any city of Central Europe, even
                  as far as Bohemia, which did not profit by his counsels and his studies. And when
                  John Huss went to the stake, in loyalty to the same idea, he and the men around
                  him were willing to acknowledge their obligation to John of Lugio and to Peter
                  Waldo.</p>
               <p>The priest stood waiting for the miller, curious to know what manner of man he was
                  who had so resolutely brought the message which he held. He was not himself
                  dressed in the costume of any ecclesiastical order. Nor was he, on the other hand,
                  dressed as any nobleman, far less as any soldier of the time would have been. He
                  might have been taken for some merchant's messenger, sent back from Lyons into the
                  country on a message about flax or woollen. His white hair appeared below a
                  traveller's hat; his tonsure of course was invisible. His surcoat was tightly
                  buttoned, as for a cold ride. There was nothing in the color or in the fashion of
                  his costume such as would challenge the remark of any wayfarer.</p>
               <p>"I am not Jean Waldo's own messenger," was the immediate reply of Gualtier of the
                  Mill, to his first inquiry; "I am only, as you see, a 'Poor Man of Lyons,' who was
                  recognized as such by our secret password when the messenger to whom Jean Waldo
                  gave this mission fell with his good horse almost at my house door. It was clear
                  enough that if the message meant anything it meant speed. This Prinhac crossed the
                  draw-bridge at Lyons before daybreak, because the bridge was held by one of our
                  people; but one cannot tell if there shall be any such good fortune this evening.
                  The bridge may be held by your worst enemy. Why! you have scant five hours to make
                  these twelve leagues which have cost us wellnigh seven hours. True, you have to go
                  down the hills, which we have had to climb. Your horses will be ready, while ours
                  had to be groomed and saddled. But, holy father, it will not answer to have any
                  horse fall under you; for if I understand the message I have brought, it is not
                  every lay brother who can take your place to-night at you girl's bedside."</p>
               <p>Father John would not even smile. "The Lord will direct," he said, "and the Lord
                  will provide. Whether my journey helps or hinders, only the Lord knows. But it
                  seems to be His work. For the love of Christ I am summoned, and IN HIS NAME I go.
                  Young man," he added, as Gualtier of the Mill adjusted for him the stirrups of the
                  noble horse who was to bear him, "when I left Lyons, they burned in the public
                  square the precious books to which I had given twenty of the best years of this
                  little life. What I could do for God and his Holy Church, they vainly tried to
                  destroy. They compelled me to part from my own poor; from the widows whose tears
                  were sacred; from the orphans I had taught and had fed; from humble homes, which
                  are as so many temples to me of God's well-beloved Son. I said then, as their
                  mocking Viguier led me to the draw-bridge, which I am to pass to-night, and bade
                  me 'Begone,'—I said, I will not see you henceforth till the day in which ye shall
                  say, 'Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.' Young man, this Jean
                  Waldo to whose household I am bidden lifted no hand for me that day, nor for his
                  kinsman, my noble friend, nor for one of the Poor Men of Lyons, or her Poor Women
                  or Children. But time brings its recompense; and to-day he is praying God that I
                  may come in time. Father Almighty, hear and answer his prayer; and grant thy
                  servant wisdom and strength to render some service this day somewhere to thy
                  children."</p>
               <p>The Miller reverently said "Amen." The priest made the sign of the cross, and
                  blessed him in parting, and then was gone.</p>
               <p>That is a curious experience in which a man of fifty-five enters on an enterprise
                  such as he has not tested for thirty years. He feels as young as ever, if he be a
                  man of pure life. The spirit of man never grows old; it seems, indeed, to grow
                  young, when it becomes as a little child every day. But John of Lugio Knew that,
                  when he was five-and-twenty, he would not have put his foot into the stirrup to
                  spring into the saddle. He knew that he would not for such<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000020"/> a day's adventure have girt on the surcoat he was
                  wearing. "It is as well," he said to the spirited horse who bore him, "it is as
                  well that you are not thirty years older than the gray stallion who bore me the
                  last day I ever saw the great Bernard." And the memory of that day of his youth,
                  and of its contrast with today, pleased him and engaged him for more than one
                  mile. And any leader of men who should have watched his skill in handling his
                  horse, and making the most of every advantage in the way, would have chosen the
                  white-haired priest as he would hardly have chosen any younger man for service
                  like this which engaged him. As physical strength declines,—and it does decline
                  after the physical man is forty-five years old,—still experience, tact, habit of
                  hand and eye, are all improving in a man well-governed and self-poised. And John
                  of Lugio had not yet reached that age when the declining curve of physical
                  strength crosses the ascending curve of experience and skill. There was not among
                  all the crusaders who at that moment were trying a winter in Palestine, or one the
                  way thither, one knight or squire more fit for hardy, active service than was
                  he.</p>
               <p>An hour's quick riding brought him to St. Rambert, where the Brevon, scarcely more
                  than a brook, joins the larger stream called the Albarine. It was even then a
                  quaint old town, which is just what the traveller would call it now. Its name is a
                  corruption of that of St. Raynebert, a son of the Duke Radbert, a martyr of five
                  centuries before John of Lugio's time and day. Before his time there had been some
                  worship of Jupiter on the hills above, and the name of the old god lingered in the
                  title "Joux," which hung even to the saint's name. St. Rambert de Joux was the
                  name by which everybody knew the village. The brook plunges and rages in a series
                  of cascades down a narrow valley, and the rider took a pathway down, which seemed
                  wholly familiar to him, which led him under the walls of the Benedictine abbey. As
                  he passed the gate, two of the brethren, in the costume of the order, came out
                  after their noonday refection, and in the narrow pathway could not but look upon
                  the rider's face, as he on them. They recognized him in an instant.</p>
               <p>"Whither so fast, Brother John?" This was their salutation.</p>
               <p>It was impossible not to drew bridle. And the first welcome of the two, impelled
                  perhaps by the very suddenness of their meeting, was so cordial, that one must
                  have been more cynical by far than John of Lugio not to respond with warmth and
                  kindness. "My brother Stephen, my brother Hugh, are you two here? I was thinking
                  of the brethren, but I did not know that you were so near. Father Ambrose does not
                  send to me to tell me the names of the new arrivals."</p>
               <p>"Father Ambrose will never send you the names of new arrivals more. He lies behind
                  the chapel yonder, and we shall lay his body in the grave to-morrow." This was the
                  immediate answer; and then there was an instant's pause, as they all recognized
                  the awkwardness of their position.</p>
               <p>John of Lugio was excommunicate. Whether they might speak to him in friendship was
                  almost a question. That they ought in strictness to denounce him, and report to
                  their superiors his presence in a town from which he had been formally banished—of
                  this there could be no question. But the two monks were men and were Christians
                  before they were monks, and with Jean both of them were united by old ties. "Will
                  you rest your horse—will you rest yourself?' said Stephen, bravely. "I will take
                  him myself into the stable, and Hugh will be only too glad to find you a cold
                  dinner in the refectory. Your horse has travelled far; he will not be the worse
                  for grooming."</p>
               <p>"He must travel father before he is groomed—and I. But I shall travel the lighter,
                  Stephen, for the kind words you speak; and you will sleep the easier that you have
                  spoken them. Do you, too, do your work, and I will do mine; and we will let
                  nothing that men can do or can say part us. No—I must not stop. I would not put
                  you two in danger by accepting your service, if I could; but I must do what few
                  men do in these degenerate days, and cross the long bridge at Lyons before the sun
                  goes down. Take the blessings of a Poor Man of Lyons, of a heretic, excommunicate!
                  God bless you, my brother—and you!"</p>
               <p>"God bless you, John; God bless you!" said the two, as they made way for his
                  horse.</p>
               <p>"It is for the love of Christ that I am speeding." said he, tenderly; "pray in
                  your prayers to-day for the Father's blessing on me 'IN HIS NAME.'"</p>
               <p>And they parted. If the monks were startled by the adventure, and they were, none
                  the less was John of Lugio startled by it. He was not afraid of them. He had seen
                  too clearly that the voice of the Holy Spirit had spoken to both of them more
                  loudly than any rule or interdict. He knew that both of them would confess the sin
                  of concealing his presence; that both of them would loyally do the penances
                  appointed. He knew as well that neither of them would betray him, while betrayal
                  would endanger him, and that neither of them, in his heart of hearts, would ever
                  be sorry for the silent service rendered to him that day.</p>
               <p>The adventure set him upon other thought than sympathy with them Had he gratified
                  the wishes and passion of his youth, his home would have been at this hour within
                  those walls. He would have been the senior of every man, except Stephen, in that
                  fraternity. He knew them all,—yes, and he knew perfectly well that not one of them
                  affected to be his equal in the scholarship and learning to which the abbey was
                  devoted. Humanly speaking, on the Abbot Ambrose's death, he himself, John of
                  Lugio, would have become his successor, the lord of this lovely estate, the
                  director in these noble ministries, the first student in these happy cloisters,
                  if—if he had only obeyed the wish of his heart thirty years ago, and given himself
                  here to student life!</p>
               <p>But instead of that, Jean of Lugio had given himself to the immediate help of the
                  Poor Men of Lyons. He had turned away from the fascination of study, to make the
                  weavers and dyers and boatmen of Lyons purer men and happier; to bring comfort and
                  life into their homes, and to make simpler their children's path to heaven. He had
                  done this with his eyes open. He had turned away from the Abbey of Cornillon, and
                  had made himself God's minister in the hovels of Lyons. And of this the reward
                  was, that this day he hazarded his life by going back to Lyons to render one
                  service more,<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6581-00000021"/> while he might have been
                  waiting, as the senior in the fraternity, within those happy abbey walls, to
                  render fit service at the Abbot Ambrose's grave.</p>
               <p>If—and the picture of half a life came in upon that if. But to John of Lugio that
                  picture brought no regrets. He had chosen as his God directed him. In calmness he
                  had foreseen what in the heat of conflict he had seen, and what he now looked back
                  upon. Foreseeing,—seeing or looking back,—it was the picture of duty bravely done.
                  And Father Jean passed down from under the walls of the abbey without a sigh or a
                  tear.</p>
               <p>The road still follows the stream, and the valley is by no means straight. Its
                  curves are picturesque enough, but they do not lead a traveller very directly. He
                  passed along the face of Mount Charvet, left the village of Serrières on his left,
                  and came, before he dared to hope, to the new Castle of Montferrand. By a sudden
                  determination he rode abruptly to the castle gate; and finding no warden, called
                  loudly to a little boy whom he saw within, and bade him summon either a porter or
                  some officer of the baron's household.</p>
               <p>The truth was, that as he tried the Baron of Meximieux's noble gray stallion on
                  one and another pace in descending the steps slopes from St. Rambert, it became
                  painfully clear that the horse had done his work for that day. The miller had
                  pressed him, perhaps, harder than he meant or knew; and, whatever care he had
                  taken, the good horse had made near ten leagues, with only the hour's rest which
                  had been given him at the cabin of Mark of Seyssel. If the priest were to succeed
                  in the task assigned to him, he must make better speed than in the last hour he
                  had made. This certainty determined his bold appeal at the castle.</p>
               <p>A summons so hearty roused all its inmates, and they appeared at one or another
                  door or corridor with that curiosity which in all times draws out the inhabitants
                  of a lonely country-house, when there is chance to look upon some unexpected face,
                  no master of what human being. The Baron of Montferrand himself made his
                  appearance. He was not dressed as if for King Philip's court, or for the
                  Emperor's. In truth, he had spent the morning in the occupation—not very lordly,
                  as we count lords, but perfectly baronial in the customs of his time—of directing
                  the servants, who flayed and cut to pieces a fat boar which they had brought in at
                  the end of yesterday's hunting. From this occupation, in which he had himself
                  personally assisted, the baron had been called to dinner; and he had dined without
                  the slightest though of revising or improving his toilet. Before dinner was fairly
                  over, he had fallen asleep in the chair, not uncomfortable, in which he sat at the
                  head of the table. He was roused from his nap by the hurrying of one and another
                  servant, as it was announced that a stranger was at the gate. A stranger in those
                  days of December was not a frequent intruder.</p>
               <p>John of Lugio was already talking with porter and seneschal. He was not displeased
                  to see the baron approach him. The old man came bareheaded, and without any outer
                  garment, beyond what he had worn at table, to protect him from the cold. The
                  traveller knew him on the instant; had seen him more than once in one or another
                  journey up or down this valley, and, indeed, in closer intimacies, in the ministry
                  of more than thirty years. But the baron, not caring a great deal for priests, and
                  not having a great deal to do with them, did not for an instant suspect that the
                  hardly rider with whom he had to do wore a tonsure, or had more than once lifted
                  the consecrated chalice before him at the mass. He saluted the stranger somewhat
                  abruptly, but still courteously, and invited him to dismount and rest himself.</p>
               <p>"I thank you for your courtesy, my Lord," was the reply. "But my errand requires
                  haste, as you will see. I am bidden to Lyons this very night, and that on service
                  which brooks no delay. I had hoped that this horse, which is from the stables at
                  Meximieux, would take me thither, and there a fresh beast waits me; but I have
                  already taken from him the best that he can give, and he will make slow work of
                  the long reach that is left for me. This is why I have stopped here: to ask, not
                  your hospitality, but your help. If I may leave this good horse, and if you have
                  another which will take me down the valley, you shall have my hearty thanks, and
                  the blessings of the home where they need me."</p>
               <p>"You tell your story frankly," said the baron; and with a stiff oath he added, "if
                  I gave horses to every vagabond from the troop of Meximieux, I should have few
                  horses left to give." Without farewell or apology, he turned to go back to his
                  dining-hall.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, my Lord," persisted Father John, without the slightest passion or
                  haste in his voice. "I am no man of the Baron of Meximieux. I am no man's man. I
                  am sent for on a work of mercy, because one Jean Waldo thinks that I can save his
                  child's life. If I am to serve her, I must be in Lyons to-night. If I am there,
                  the service will be yours, not mine."</p>
               <p>"If I should give horses to every beggar who chooses to ride out of Lyons, I
                  should have no horses to give," said the baron. Like many men of little invention,
                  he had been so much pleased by the cadence of his first retort, that he could not
                  but try its force again. But the repetition of the insult gave the father courage.
                  A man truly resolved does not say the same thing twice. Most likely he does not
                  speak twice at all.</p>
               <p>"I am no beggar from Lyons, or no servant of the Lyons merchant. Lyons does not
                  love me, nor is there any reason but what I tell why I should care to enter Lyons.
                  But if you had a daughter dying, my Lord Baron, and Jean Waldo could send her a
                  physician, you would be glad to have him send, though you never saw his face, and
                  though you do not love his craft of his city. Can you not do as you would be done
                  by?"</p>
               <p>He had perhaps gained his point, though the baron, with a stupid notion that he
                  must maintain his dignity in the presence of his own servants, tried to do so by a
                  certain delay, which would have exasperated a person of less experience and less
                  balance than Father John.</p>
               <p>"How am I to know," said the wavering Montferrand, "that you are the leech you say
                  you are? What is your token? If I am to give a horse to every quack who rides
                  between Amberieux and St. Rambert, I should have no horses left to give."</p>
               <p>"I have no token, my Lord. A man who has spoken truth for forty years, going up
                  and down this valley<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6581-00000022"/> ley, needs no token
                  that he does not lie" He took off his hat as he spoke, and showed the tonsure.
                  "You have received Christ's body from this hand, my Lord. You know that these lips
                  will not speak falsely to you." And then, watching his man carefully, and noticing
                  a change come on his face at the mention of the Saviour, he added as if by
                  intention, and almost in a whisper: "It is for the love of Christ that I ask the
                  best horse in your stables."</p>
               <p>"Saddle Chilperic! Saddle Chilperic! Why are you clowns gaping and sneezing there?
                  Saddle Chilperic! I say, and take this gentleman's good horse where he can be
                  cared for. Take my hand, father, take my hand. Gently—so—you are stiff from
                  riding. Come into the hall and let the baroness have a word with you! Chilperic
                  will not be ready for a minute, and you will at least drink a glass of wine! If it
                  only shows that you do not bear malice, you will drink a glass of wine! We are
                  rough fellows, we hill barons, and we speak when we do not think, Father. But,
                  indeed, I would have been more ready had you summoned me 'IN HIS NAME.'" And he
                  crossed himself as he passed the threshold.</p>
               <p>In those surroundings, in the company in which they were, the baron did not dare
                  question the priest further, nor explain how he had been initiated into the secret
                  fraternity by the password of which he had been adjured. Nor did he care to say
                  much to explain the inconsistency of his brutal refusal of one moment, when it was
                  compared with his ready tenderness at the next. Perhaps it is best for all of us
                  that we do not have to reconcile such inconsistencies as often as we are conscious
                  of them. Once more he pressed the priest to refresh himself with wine, and he
                  called loudly on his wife to join in his rough welcome as he entered the hall.</p>
               <p>The little woman came forward, bending somewhat with rheumatism more than age, but
                  with freshness and quickness, and with all the courtesy and dignity of noble
                  breeding. Whether the grooms and other servants, and the idlers in the court-yard,
                  had guessed the secret of the baron's sudden change of purpose, or had failed to
                  guess it, she, who had seen the whole from her open casement, understood it all in
                  a flash. Now that Father John entered the room she recognized him in an instant,
                  as the baron had not done. But she knew very well that his liberty and possibly
                  even his life depended on his passing on his errand unrecognized by her servants,
                  and her perfect manner, therefore, was exactly what it would have been had he been
                  any other person—a friend of the Lyonese weaver—summoned in hot haste to his
                  daughter's bedside. She dropped her courtesy, advanced to take the hat of the
                  traveller, begged him to sit at her husband's side at the head of the table, and
                  with her own hand poured the wine from the coarse jug which held it, into the
                  highly-wrought cup which the bustling baron had found for his guest. "I heard
                  something said of a lady—a girl—a sick girl. Is there nothing I can send from our
                  stores? I could in a moment put up maiden-wort, or rosemary, or St. Mary's herb,
                  if your reverence will only take them."</p>
               <p>But the Father thanked her and declined. His friends in Lyons must have at their
                  command such drugs as could be of service, if anything can be of service
                  indeed.</p>
               <p>"Ah, sir," she said, "if only you will render service to them, like the blessing
                  you once gave to me!"</p>
               <p>"To you!" and he looked amazed into those sharp little black eyes, which twinkled
                  under eyebrows snow white with the same liveliness as if she were still sixteen
                  years old.</p>
               <p>"To me!" she said again; and as he looked with undisguised ignorance of her
                  meaning, it was impossible that she should not smile, and she hastily wiped away
                  from the little eyes the tears that at first filled them. "Ah, you do not
                  remember, my Father. It is a shame for a knight to forget a lady whose colors he
                  has worn,—may a priest forget a lady whom he has served in the last extremity?"
                  And she fairly laughed at his perplexity.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Madame! you must pardon what time does, and exile. Whoever it is, I can see
                  that you carry the secret of perpetual youth, but I lost that long ago. It is very
                  long since I was in the castle of Montferrand, long before you were ever here, my
                  lady."</p>
               <p>"Chilperic will be ready before you guess me out," said she; "and, as your errand
                  presses, I will tell you, if you will promise when it is over to stay as many
                  weeks in the castle as you have now spent minutes here. It is fair to remind you
                  of the day when a girl with a scarlet cape, and a girl with a blue cape, and a
                  girl with no cape at all, went sailing down the river with two young squires and
                  with a very foolish page, from the home of the Barons of Braine. And have you
                  forgotten—"</p>
               <p>"Alix! Alix de Braine! It is impossible that I should have forgotten! But that you
                  are here is as strange as that I am here. Where the four others are, perhaps you
                  know!"</p>
               <p>"Chilperic is ready, my Lord." This was the interruption of the groom at the
                  door.</p>
               <p>"Chilperic is ready, and life and death compel me to go on. Dear Lady Alix, you
                  ask me to be your guest. You do not know, then, that if I had drunk from this cup
                  of wine, you would share my excommunication; that if I slept under this roof, you
                  could never enter church again; no, not to be borne there on your bier!"</p>
               <p>"Did I not know it?" whispered the brave little woman. "Did I not know that you
                  were journeying 'For the love of Christ,' and do not my husband and I beg you to
                  stay with us as his guest and ours? our request is made, and our welcome will be
                  given 'IN HIS NAME.'"</p>
               <p>And they parted.</p>
               <p>The baron had already left the hall. When the priest stepped into the court-yard,
                  and as he put his foot in the stirrup, he saw to his surprise that his host had
                  already mounted another horse, and was waiting for him, himself ready equipped for
                  a winter's expedition. A heavy fox-skin jacket had been thrown over the dress none
                  too light, which he wore before and he had in the moment of his absence drawn on
                  riding boots also.</p>
               <p>The father acknowledged the courtesy, but expressed his unwillingness to give to
                  his host such trouble. He was glad of his company, he said, but really he needed
                  no protection.</p>
               <p>"Protection! I think not, while<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6581-00000023"/> you are
                  on or are near the territory of Montferrand." This was the baron's reply, with the
                  addition of one or two rough oaths, untranslatable either into our language or
                  into the habit of this page, but such as, it must be confessed, shot like a sort
                  of lurid thread into the web-work of all the poor man's conversation. "I should
                  not like to see poacher or peasant who would say a rough word to any man whom he
                  saw riding on one of my horses. No, my father, it is not to protect you that I
                  ride, but to talk with you. We hill barons are rough fellows, as I said, but we
                  are not the clowns or the fools that the gentry of the chapter choose to think us.
                  Meximieux here has tried to cheat me about the fish, and has sent his falcons
                  after my herons a dozen times, so that I have not spoken to him or to his for
                  fifteen years before he went off on this Holy Land tomfoolery,—I beg your
                  reverence's pardon for calling it so. But I will say of Meximieux himself, that he
                  is neither clown nor fool, and if I were to have to strike at King Saladin or any
                  of his Emirs, I had rather Meximieux were at my side than any of the dandy-jacks I
                  saw the day the bridge went down. We are rough fellows, I say,"—and here he tried
                  to pick up the thread which he had dropped a long breath before, but he tried not
                  wholly successfully,—"we are rough fellows, I say; but when a man of courage and
                  of heart like your reverence comes to see us, and that is none too often, we are
                  glad to learn something of what he has learned, and we would fain answer his
                  questions if he have any to put to us."</p>
               <p>"But I must say to you, my Lord, as I said to the Lady Alix, that to help me on my
                  way is to put yourself under the ban. I was recognized within this hour by two of
                  the monks in the abbey of Cornillon yonder, old and intimate friends of mine.
                  Perhaps they will not denounce me, but the first fishermen we meet may, or the
                  first shepherd's boy. For I have trudged up and down this valley too often for me
                  to be a stranger here. It is not fair that I should expose you, for your courtesy,
                  to the punishment which is none too easy upon me."</p>
               <p>"Punishment be —!" said the baron, with an oath again. Nor did the excellent man
                  even condescend to the modern foolery of asking the clergyman's pardon for such
                  excesses,—"it is no great punishment to a hill baron to tell him that he shall
                  never enter a church. It is some little while since I have troubled them, even
                  now. And if it should happen that this old carcass should rot on the hill-side
                  where it happens to fall, why that is neither more nor less than is happening this
                  very winter to many a gallant fellow who went on their fool's errand—I beg your
                  pardon—against the Saracen. To tell the truth, sir, I want to talk about this very
                  business,—of your punishment, as you call it, and of what I and other good fellows
                  are to do, who hold that you and your friends are right, and that the
                  soup-guzzling, wine-tippling, book-burning, devil-helping gowned men down in the
                  city yonder are all wrong." It was with a good deal of difficulty that he worked
                  through this long explanation, even with the help which his swearing seemed to
                  give him. But there could be no doubt that he was very much in earnest in making
                  it. He seemed to be helped by the tremendous pace at which the two horses, who had
                  been caged in the stables for two or three days, were taking them over a stretch
                  of level road.</p>
               <p>"I do not know what I can tell you," said the priest, who seemed to be as little
                  disturbed as the baron was by the rapidity of their pace, and rode as if he had
                  been born on horseback. "I cannot tell you what to do, because I hardly know what
                  I am to do myself—except wait. I wait till the good Lord shall open brighter days,
                  as in His Day he will. Meanwhile, from day to day, I do what my hand finds to do,
                  'For the Love of Christ,' or 'IN HIS NAME.'"</p>
               <p>"All very fine of you, my Father," said the other, a little chastened perhaps by
                  his temperance of tone. "All very fine of you, who have something to do for the
                  'love of Christ.' You can go hither or thither, and every man has, as my wife Alix
                  there had, some story to tell of the cure you have wrought or the comfort you have
                  given. But that is nothing to me. It is not every day that I have a chance to
                  beard the damned rascals in their own hell-hole, by giving a horse from my stables
                  to one of these men they are hunting. I wish to God it were!" And the baron's rage
                  rose so that he became unintelligible, as the horses forged along.</p>
               <p>When the priest caught his drift again, he was saying, "If it had not been such
                  damned nonsense, all nursery tales and chapman's stuff and priest's gabble,—I beg
                  your pardon, sir,—I would have left the whole crew of them. Thirty men in good
                  armor can I put on horseback, Sir Priest, and though they should not be all as
                  well mounted as is your reverence, yet not one of the dogs should cross a beast
                  but was better than those which that hog of a Meximieux rode and led, when he
                  followed the Archbishop to the Holy Land. Enough better," he added, with a
                  chuckle, "than that waddling oil-sack that I saw the Archbishop himself ambling
                  out of Lyons upon. I tell you I would have gone to these wars gladly, if I could
                  have thought there were fewer Archbishops in the armies, and more men with heads
                  upon their shoulders. But I told Alix, said I, they are all fools that are not
                  knaves, and all knaves that are not fools; and, if King Saladin eats them all, the
                  world will be the better for it. No matter for them, your reverence. Now the
                  Archbishop is gone, could not a few of us,—perhaps Servette yonder, Blon, I think,
                  and very likely Montluel, no matter for names,—suppose we put two hundred good men
                  in saddle, and take down as many more spearmen with tough ash lances. Suppose we
                  raised a cross of our own, such a cross as this, your reverence," and he made the
                  criss-cross sweep up and down, and then from right to left, by which all these
                  affiliated men and women denoted the cross of Malta. Suppose we rode into Lyons
                  some moonlight evening, shouting that we came "For the Love of Christ," do you not
                  think that there are as many stout weavers and dock-men and boatmen, and other
                  good fellows there, who would turn out 'IN HIS NAME'?"</p>
               <p>Then when he saw that the priest did not answer, he added, "I tell you, Father, we
                  would send their seneschals and their viguiers and their couriers and their
                  popinjay men-at-arms scattering in no time; we would smoke the old pot bellies<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6581-00000024"/> out of their kitchens and refectories,
                  and we would bring the Poor Men of Lyons home to their own houses, to the House of
                  Bread and the House of God, quite as quick as they were driven out." All this,
                  with a scattered fire of wild oaths, which added to the droll incongruity of what
                  the good fellow was saying.</p>
               <p>If John of Lugio had been a mere ecclesiastic, he would have said, "Ah, my friend,
                  they who take the sword must perish with the sword." And then the poor baron, who
                  had perhaps never spoken at such length in his life before, would have shrunk back
                  into his shell, cursed himself for a fool and his companion for another, and never
                  would have understood why an offer so promising was refused. But John of Lugio was
                  not a mere ecclesiastic, nor was he any other sort of fool. He was a man of God,
                  indeed, but he showed in this case, as in a thousand others, as in his whole life
                  he showed, that he knew how to tell God's messages to all sorts of men. "My Lord,"
                  said he, "perhaps you are right in thinking that these kings and barons and
                  archbishops and bishops, and all the rest of the pilgrims who have gone to the
                  Holy City, will never get there. Perhaps you are right in thinking that if they
                  ride down fifty thousand Saracens and burn the houses of fifty thousand more, they
                  will not teach the Saracens any very good lesson of God's love or of God's son. I
                  believe you are right, or I would have gone when my old friend the Archbishop
                  went. But suppose we rode into Lyons in the same fashion; suppose we drove out the
                  chapter, as the chapter drove us out; suppose we stole their horses, as they stole
                  ours,—why all the world would have a right to say worse things of the 'Poor Men of
                  Lyons,' than it has ever said till now. No! no! my Lord," he said, after a moment;
                  "leave it to time and to the good God above there. No fear that this archbishop
                  will prosper too long, or this chapter; and for me, what more can I ask than as
                  good a friend as I have found this day? And for you, what more can you ask than
                  such a home as Montferrand, and such a wife as the Lady Alix?"</p>
               <p>But the baron was hardly disposed to turn off, with a laugh, the plan which seemed
                  to him so promising. He began upon it again; he even showed to his friend that he
                  had thought it out in detail. He knew how large a guard was here and how large
                  there; how many of the best men-at-arms were in Syria with the Archbishop; and how
                  poor were the equipments of those who were left at home. "In old times," he said,
                  "the Count of Forez would have been at our backs, but now, who knows but he would
                  strike a stout blow on our side? There is not a man this side Marseilles who would
                  be more glad than he to see these black-bellied hornets smoked out of their
                  hives."</p>
               <p>The Father listened as courteously as before, but as firmly. He seemed to think
                  that a little authority might well be exerted now, and he said simply: "My Lord, I
                  warn you that you are thinking of what you must not think of. If what you propose
                  were the right thing to do, you would have been warned of it before now by those
                  in authority. Till you are, and till I am, we must let monks, priests, and bishops
                  alone."</p>
               <p>And Montferrand supposed, perhaps he supposed rightly, that some where the "Poor
                  Men of Lyons" had a council and a master, wiser than he was, who would some day
                  give him a signal when he might gallop on this road on the back of Chilperic, with
                  every man whom he could put in the saddle, ready for a raid into Lyons. The baron
                  was not yet trained enough in trusting Providence to know that the only authority
                  to which John of Lugio would ever defer, was an authority far above chapter,
                  archbishop, king, or pope.</p>
               <p>He turned the subject, therefore, a little uneasily, to the eternal question of
                  the crusade. Did his reverence think the troopers would soon he home again? and
                  did he think they would find the sword of Saladin so weak? and all the other
                  questions of the home gossip of the day. Meanwhile, on all the road which did not
                  absolutely forbid speed, the two horses flew along, much as Barbe Noire had flown
                  that morning, and with no such fatal issue. The ride was a short one, indeed,
                  before they entered the court-yard of the Castle of Meximieux. Here was the horse
                  of Gualtier of the Mill, saddled, bridled, and waiting for his rider.</p>
               <p>"Sixteen years since I saw the inside of this court!" said Montferrand, as he
                  swung himself off his horse, and as he wiped his forehead. "The tall tree yonder
                  has been planted since then. As I remember the court, my man, there was not a
                  green twig in it."</p>
               <p>The servant bowed, and said that the trees which the baron saw had all been there
                  when he came into the stable service, but, as the baron saw, they were not very
                  old.</p>
               <p>"Sixteen years!" said the rugged old chief again. "It was fifteen years ago at
                  Michaelmas that I asked Meximieux if he would make the fish good to me, and he
                  swore he would do no such thing. And I have not spoken to him from that day to
                  this. And now he is lying under some fig-tree yonder, and I am standing in his
                  castle court. Your reverence, I should have said this morning, that all the devils
                  in hell could not bring me into the shadow of Meximieux's walls. And see what you
                  have done."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my lord," said the other, who had already mounted; "a messenger from heaven,
                  though he be a very humble one, can do a great deal that the devils in hell cannot
                  do. And now, my lord, good-by. Give a poor priest's best salutations to the Lady
                  Alix. And, my lord, when Meximieux comes home, win a greater victory than he has
                  done. Ask him if, 'For the love of Christ,' he will not make it right about the
                  fish, and see what a pilgrim like him will answer, 'In His Name.'"</p>
               <p>He gave the baron his hand, and was gone. "As good a horseman," said the old man,
                  "as ever served under King Philip. And I wonder how many of them all are doing as
                  good service as he is this day!"</p>
               <p>Gualtier of the Mill had not exaggerated the worth of the horse which the priest
                  mounted, and the horse had never had a better rider. From Meximieux to Lyons, the
                  road was and is more than seven leagues, but the rider knew that it was by far the
                  easier part of the way, and, thanks to Chilperic and the baron, he had left full
                  half the time allotted for his journey. He had the hope also, which proved well
                  founded, that he might not have to rely on the miller's horse alone, but that he
                  might find at Miribel, or some other village on the road, a fresh horse sent out
                  to meet him by Jean Waldo.</p>
               <p>In this hope, he rode faster than he would have dared to do, were he<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000025"/> obliged to use one horse for the whole journey. And
                  at a rapid rate, indeed, and without companionship or adventure, he came to the
                  hamlet which the miller had left that morning, where poor Prinhac's enterprise had
                  come to a conclusion so untimely. The horse neighed his recognition of some of his
                  companions, as they entered the wretched hamlet, and, in a moment more, the father
                  saw Prinhac himself, evidently waiting for him, in the shadow of the wall of the
                  miller's garden.</p>
               <p>The weaver stepped forward into the roadway as John of Lugio approached, and, with
                  his little willow switch, made in the air the mystic sign. The priest drew bridle,
                  and the horse evidently knew that he was at home. Prinhac and the priest had never
                  met before. The weaver eagerly asked the other if he were the physician so much
                  desired, and thanked God as eagerly when he knew, that, so far, his mission had
                  not been in vain. "I would break my collar-bone a dozen times, if I could save my
                  young mistress so easily. And there is not another boy on the looms or in the
                  shops but would say the same thing." He told the priest hastily that he knew
                  little about the girl's disaster. He described to him his own route and progress,
                  and the miserable accident by which he had been delayed. He added, "Nothing was
                  said about fresh horses, but I have been watching for them all day. You ought to
                  meet some one at Miribel, or, at the worst, when you cross the river the first
                  time."</p>
               <p>The priest asked him what he could tell him about the girl's illness.</p>
               <p>"Nothing—nothing. I know she was as well as a bird at sunset; I saw her and spoke
                  to her as she came singing down the hill. The next I knew was, that my master woke
                  me in the dead of the dark, and asked me for the love of Christ to bring to you
                  this message. Forgive me, father, but if he had asked me to do it for love of
                  Mademoiselle Félicie, I should have done it as willingly."</p>
               <p>"Hast thou done it unto one of the least of these, thou hast done it unto me!"
                  Such was the half answer of the priest, which, perhaps, the crippled weaver
                  understood. "I must not stay, my good fellow; if I am to be of any use, I must go.
                  I shall tell the child how faithful a messenger she found in you. God bless you,
                  and farewell."</p>
               <p>The weaver was right in supposing that a relay would await the physician at
                  Miribel. He found there another of Jean Waldo's men with another of his horses.
                  The man did not, of course, recognize the physician, nor the horse he rode; but it
                  was not difficult for the priest, who was on the lookout for him, to persuade him
                  that it was for him that Cœur-Blanc had been saddled. The man had left Lyons two
                  hours before noon. His tidings of his young mistress were scarcely encouraging.
                  She was no better, he was sure of that. The Florentine doctor had not left her all
                  the day, nor her father or mother; he was sure of that. His directions were simply
                  to wait for the priest at Miribel, and to bid him mount Cœur-Blanc, while he was
                  to bring home Barbe-Noire as soon as might be. So</p>
               <p>The Father rode on alone. The child was alive. So far was well. For the rest, he
                  had carried with him all day that sinking of heart which any man feels when he is
                  called to struggle with death, only because all others have so far failed in that
                  very encounter.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE TROUBADOUR.</head>
               <p>FRESHLY mounted, and well mounted too, the tired man bade the groom good-by, and
                  entered on his last hour with that comfortable feeling which, even to the most
                  tired man, the last hour brings. Alas! it was the old story, Prinhac's story of
                  the morning. He was, as it proved, in more danger in this last hour, than he had
                  been through all the rest of the day.</p>
               <p>He was pushing over the meadows of the valley at a sharp trot, when he met a rider
                  coming out from the city, on a sorry-looking beast, in the rather jaunty or
                  fantastic costume which indicated that he was one of the trouvères, or
                  troubadours. The man nodded good-naturedly, perhaps a little familiarly. John of
                  Lugio, absorbed in the old-time memories which the day had renewed, acknowledged
                  the salutation with less familiarity, but with a sort of reserved courtesy,
                  taking, indeed, but little real notice of the traveller as he did so. The man
                  pushed on cheerfully, but, in a moment, stopped his horse, turned, and scrutinized
                  the priest with care, and then making a speaking trumpet of both hands, hailed him
                  with:—</p>
               <p>"Holà! holà! there; will you halt a minute?"</p>
               <p>Halting was not in John of Lugio's schedule for that afternoon, if he could help
                  himself. He heard the cry distinctly, but knew no reason why he should stop at the
                  demand of a troubadour. On the other hand, he would not seem to avoid the other.
                  He did not turn for an instant, therefore; he did not spur his horse on the other
                  hand, but he let him hold to the sharp, rapid trot that he was pursuing.</p>
               <p>The troubadour saw his haste, and shouted only with the more eagerness:—</p>
               <p>"Holà! holà! there; halt! halt!"</p>
               <p>But the well-mounted rider swept along.</p>
               <p>The stranger screamed once more, but saw that the other halted his speed not by a
                  second. He was, indeed, out of any fair car-shot by this time.</p>
               <p>The troubadour fairly groaned. He looked anxiously at the declining sun, and
                  resolved, on the instant, to go in pursuit of the fugitive, even with the wretched
                  brute which he had under him, who was but the poorest competitor in a match with
                  Jean Waldo's powerful Arab on which the priest was mounted.</p>
               <p>For the priest himself, he did not once turn round. It was not his part to show
                  anxiety, and, indeed, he did not know that he was followed. But, if he were
                  followed, he did not mean to be readily overtaken.</p>
               <p>There is a little elevation in the road, as it crosses the slope of a spur of one
                  of the northern hills, and the moment that John of Lugio knew that he was shielded
                  by it from the sight of any one on the flat ground behind, he pressed his horse
                  even to a gallop, and flew over the ground at a speed which almost defied pursuit.
                  Had this rate of going lasted he would soon have found himself at the Rhone
                  again.</p>
               <p>But no; he had to draw bridle in less than a mile, that his unusual rate of travel
                  might not challenge the curiosity of the loungers in a little<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000026"/> tle hamlet before him as the road turned. Two or
                  three horses were tethered on the outside of a wine-shop, a boy seemed to be
                  watching them, and one or two idlers stood by. John of Lugio hoped that he might
                  get by without attracting attention.</p>
               <p>No! As he nodded civilly to the by-standers, two men, half soldiers, half
                  gens-d'armes, if these modern words explain at all a race of officers now existing
                  no longer, stepped out from the tavern. They were in the livery worn by the
                  servants of police of the archbishop and chapter of Lyons.</p>
               <p>"Where's your haste, my tall friend?" said the one who was rather the more tipsy
                  of the two. "Where's your haste to-day? Stop and have something—something to drink
                  with Jean Gravier here. His wine is bad, the worst wine I ever drank, but it is
                  better wine than none."</p>
               <p>The priest's business at this moment was, not to preach, nor warn, nor convert
                  drunkards from the error of their ways, but to get to Lyons before sunset. He
                  showed no sign of annoyance, but laughed good-naturedly, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Thank you kindly; I will pay the scot if the rest will drink. But I have but just
                  mounted at Miribel yonder, and I must be in Lyons before the sun goes down."</p>
               <p>"Sun!" said the drunken tipstaff, "sun be hanged! The sun has two good hours yet
                  in the sky, and with that horse of yours, you will see the guard long before
                  sunset. Come and try Jean Gravier's red wine."</p>
               <p>The priest would not show uneasiness. But again he declined, proposing that a
                  stoup of wine should be brought out that all the company might share; judging, not
                  unwisely, that he should do well to enlist as many of them as he might upon his
                  side. At this, another of the officers came out from the tavern. Unfortunately for
                  the priest's errand, he was much more sober than his companion. Unfortunately
                  again, he was no foreign hireling, as the others were, but was a Lyonnais born.
                  The moment he looked upon John of Lugio he recognized him, or thought he did, and
                  he addressed him in a mood very different from that of his noisy companions. The
                  man looked jealously at Father John, as men of his craft were and are apt to look
                  at all strangers. He did not drop or turn his eye either; after the first glance
                  he surveyed the whole figure of the rider and his horse as well.</p>
               <p>"You are riding one of Jean Waldo's horses," he said, gruffly.</p>
               <p>"I am," said the priest; "he sent it out to meet me by one of his grooms. I left
                  my own horse at Miribel."</p>
               <p>"You are a friend of Jean Waldo's, then?"</p>
               <p>"I am a friend of a friend of his," said the priest, with an aspect of courage and
                  frankness, "and I am eager to be in Lyons at to-morrow's festival at his house.
                  That is why I cannot tarry with our friends here. I must pay my scot and
                  begone."</p>
               <p>"Not quite so fast," said the officer; "have you any pass to show if you are asked
                  for one at the bridge?"</p>
               <p>"Pass,—no," said the priest, laughing. "I had a pass years ago, signed by the
                  Viguier, but it was worn out long since, while I waited for somebody to ask me for
                  it I think the Viguier will not turn out any of Jean Waldo's friends. What is my
                  scot?" he said, as if impatient, to the tavern-keeper. "All the passes in the
                  world will not serve me if I come to the long bridge after sundown. And I should
                  be glad to be there before the crowd."</p>
               <p>The tavern-keeper took the copper coins which the priest paid him, and Father
                  John, on his part, saluted the others, and turned as if he would go away, when the
                  persistent officer stopped him.</p>
               <p>"Not so fast, my friend. You know very well that I have good right to question
                  you, and you must not wonder if I suspect you. If you take a little ride to-night
                  with me and my friends here to the chateau of Meyzieux where we are going, I
                  promise you as good a bed there as Messer Jean Waldo will give you. Then you can
                  ride into Lyons with us in the morning, and can make a little visit to the Viguier
                  with me, before you go to your Christmas dinner. That will give him a chance to
                  give you another parchment pass, and I am quite sure he will be glad to do 60,
                  unless he wants your closer company.</p>
               <p>And he gave a loud guffaw of laughter, in which his two companions joined.</p>
               <p>For the peasants and the tavern-keeper, they were too much accustomed to such acts
                  of petty tyranny on the part of petty officials to show surprise. Indeed, they
                  hardly felt it. John of Lugio knew that, though he might have their sympathy, they
                  would not render to him any sort of help if he defied in the least the authority
                  of his persecutors.</p>
               <p>With that same unperturbed manner which he had shown all along, he laughed
                  good-naturedly, and said at once, what was perfectly true:—</p>
               <p>"The Viguier is an old friend of mine, and will remember me very well." Then he
                  added, "Suppose I meet you and your friends as you come into town to-morrow, and
                  go round there and see him. I give you my hand on it that I will be at the
                  drawbridge at any time you name."</p>
               <p>And he offered his bare hand.</p>
               <p>"No,"said the other, sternly and slowly. "We are not such fools as to take men's
                  hands, unless to put handcuffs on them. You will go to Meyzieux with us in half an
                  hour. Till then you may come into the house and drink with us, or you may stay out
                  here and freeze, as it pleases you. Michel, Antoine, keep your eyes on him, and
                  see that he does not leave." And he turned to go into the tavern. But he saw that
                  the priest made no resistance. On the other hand, he dismounted at once, and
                  occupied himself in looking for something which had clogged the shoe of the noble
                  horse which he was riding.</p>
               <p>At this moment the attention of all parties was engaged by the arrival of a
                  new-comer upon the scene. The surly officer himself loitered on the steps of the
                  inn, when he heard the clear, loud voice of the troubadour:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">"Who will listen yet again</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">To the old and jovial strain,</l>
                        <l>The old tale of love that's ever new?</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">She's a girl as fair as May,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">He's a boy as fresh as day,</l>
                        <l>And the story is as gay as it is true."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The voice was a perfectly clear and pure tenor. The air was lively without being
                  rapid, and the enunciation and emphasis of the singer were perfect. The poor beast
                  he rode came panting into the crowd, his sides wet and dirty; and the singer, with
                  undisguised satisfaction, sprang from his back, and threw the rein to a
                  stable-boy.</p>
               <p>"Your servant, gentlemen,—your servant, gentlemen,—are there no lovers of the gay
                  science in this honorable<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6581-00000027"/> orable

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"A beautiful song, and a story that will make you laugh and make you cry,
                  gentlemen, both together.</p>
               <p>"Will you hear the pretty tale, or is it too gay for you? We are not always gay.
                  We trouvèurs have fathers and mothers and sisters and brothers like the rest of
                  you. We have to lay our little babies in the ground sometimes, as you do." All
                  this he said perfectly seriously and reverently. "We love the good God as you love
                  him, and we can tell you the stories of the saints and of the prophets; may God
                  bless us all as we do so."</p>
               <p>And then in a minor key, and with a strain wholly different, he sang slowly, and
                  almost in tears it seemed,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"For the Love of Christ our Saviour along the road I came,</l>
                        <l>And what I stop to sing you, I sing it IN HIS NAME."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It need hardly be said that John of Lugio caught the indication given to him, that
                  this was a friend, from whom he had been so rashly escaping. The poor brute before
                  him was still panting from the efforts which the rider had made to overtake
                  Cœur-Blanc before he reached the trap into which the priest had fallen. In that
                  the singer had failed. But none the less had he bravely pressed on and entered
                  that trap himself. And by the little scrap he sang, he revealed himself as a
                  friend to the other,—one friend who could be relied upon in the midst of
                  indifferent spectators and avowed enemies. John of Lugio did not dare reply, even
                  by a glance. The singer needed no reply, and looked for no glance. He went on, as
                  they all sat down in the one room of the tavern, as if he were rattling on in the
                  fashion of his craft:—</p>
               <p>"Or I have the new song, which won the golden violet last year. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"In a pretty little meadow, in a country that I know,</l>
                        <l>A pretty little flower did bourgeon and did grow,</l>
                        <l>Its root was in a dunghill, but day to day would bring</l>
                        <l>Fresh food and fragrance to the weed, all through the days of
                           spring."</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>His clear resonant voice was fairly triumphant as the words rolled on. But he
                  stopped and said, "Boy, bring me my little guitar; if I am to sing to the
                  gentlemen, I must play to them too. Only tell me what it shall be, gentlemen."</p>
               <p>"Let it be," said John of Lugio, boldly, "the song you sing 'For the Love of
                  Christ and in His Name.'" And thus he opened his communication with the other.</p>
               <p>The chief of the officers turned with an undisguised sneer upon his prisoner. "So,
                  said he, we are coming the godly, are we? That's old chaff for such as we, Mr.
                  Friend's friend. Sing one of your love songs.",</p>
               <p>"Love songs be hanged!" said the keeper of the inn; "the girls here say they have
                  heard about Nicolette and Aucassin till they are tired; they want the new song,
                  the song of the violet. Can you teach it to them, Messer Trouvèur?"</p>
               <p>"I can sing it, and I can teach it too, to such apt scholars as Mademoiselle
                  Anne," said the singer, rising and bowing as the buxom girl came into the room
                  rather shyly, with one or two of her village companions. The troubadour, with some
                  exercise of authority, cleared a place for them where he sate himself,—made the
                  boys rise from their seats on a settle that the young women might have them, ran
                  over the air once or twice on the guitar, and sang again.</p>

               <p>The girls were nodding to the air, and were much more interested in that, perhaps,
                  than in the words,—but the leader of the gens d'armes, if we may again use the
                  modern word, expressed his scorn for the whole.</p>
               <p>"Bring him some wine, Jean; wet his whistle for him. Dunghills and Death, indeed,
                  is that the best he has to sing of? Give him some wine, and give me some; give
                  everybody some. Mr. Friend's friend's friend, take some wine to show you bear no
                  malice. Girls! have some wine; all drink, and then let him tell us his love
                  story."</p>
               <p>With a good deal of bustle and readjustment of the company, with much fuss at
                  serving wine for so many, these arbitrary orders were executed. The troubadour,
                  meanwhile, was thrumming on his guitar,—tuning it,—and striking chords, or trying
                  one or another bit of the tune. When the Captain gave word, at last, that they
                  were all ready, he began again with the same song, with which he had at first

                           <p>"Now you must know, my lords and my ladies, that the Count Bougars of
                              Valence chose to make war with the Count Garin of Beaucaire. And the
                              war was so cruel, that the Count never let one day go by, but what he
                              came thundering at the walls and barriers of the town, with a hundred
                              knights and with ten thousand men-at-arms, on foot and on horseback,
                              who burned all the horses, and stole all the sheep, and killed all the
                              people that they could.</p>
                           <p>"Now the Count Garin de Beaucaire was very old, and was sadly broken
                              with years. He had used his time very ill, had the Count de Beaucaire.
                              And the old wretch had no heir, either son or daughter, except one boy
                              whose name was ACCASSIN.</p>
                           <p>"Aucassin was gentle and handsome. He was tall and well made; his legs
                              were good and his feet were good, his body was good and his arms were
                              good. His hair was blond, a little curly; his eyes were like gray fur,
                              for they were near silver and near blue, and they laughed when you
                              looked at them. His nose was high and well placed; his face was clear
                              and winning. Yes, and he had everything charming, and nothing bad
                              about him. But this young man was so wholly conquered by love,—who
                              conquers everybody,—that he would not occupy himself in any other
                              thing. He would not be a knight, he would not take arms, he would not
                              go to the tourneys, he would not do any of the things he ought to
                              do.</p>
                           <p>"His father was very much troubled by this, and he said to him one
                              morning:—</p>
                           <p>"'My son, take your arms, mount your horse, defend your country,
                              protect your people. If they only see you in the midst of them, this
                              will give them more courage; they will fight all the better for their
                              lives and their homes; for your land and mine.</p>
                           <p>"'Father,' said Aucassin, 'why do you say this to me?</p>
                           <p>"'May God never hear my prayers, if I ever mount horse, or go to
                              tourney, or to battle, before you have, yourself, given to me my
                              darling Nicolette,—my sweetheart whom I love so dearly.</p>
                           <p>"'My son,' said the father to him, 'this cannot be.</p>
                           <p>"'Give up forever your dreams of this captive girl, whom the Saracens
                              brought from some strange land, and sold to the Viscount here.</p>
                           <p>"'He trained her; he baptized her; she is his god-child.</p>
                           <p>"'Some day he will give her to some brave fellow who will have to gain
                              his bread by his sword.</p>
                           <p>"'But you, my son, when the time comes that you wish to take a wife, I
                              will give you some king's daughter, or at least the daughter of a
                              Count.</p>
                           <p>"'There is not, in all Provence, a man so rich that you may not marry
                              his daughter, if you choose.</p>
                           <p>"So said the old man. But Aucassin replied:—</p>
                           <p>"'Alas, my father; there is not in this world the principality which
                              would not be honored if my darling Nicolette, my sweetest, went to
                              live there.</p>
                           <p>"'If she were Queen of France or of England; if she were Empress of
                              Germany or of Greece, she could not be more courteous or more
                              gracious; she could not have sweeter ways or greater virtues.'"</p>

               <p>At this point the troubadour nodded to the girl Anne, who, as she had said, knew
                  the airs and the songs of the little Romance. One of the village girls joined her,
                  and thus in trio the three sang:— <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The commander of the squad of policemen had not mistaken in his<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000029"/> estimate of the attractive powers of fiction,
                  sentiment, and religion in such an assembly as that around the tavern. As the
                  little love story went on with the song belonging to it, groups of idlers
                  out-doors pressed into the great doorway of the tavern. The grooms left with the
                  horses arranged that one boy only should hold them all; and he, getting hint of
                  what was passing, made shift to knot the bridles together, to fasten them all to a
                  halter at the corner of the house, and to crowd in after the rest. From the other
                  cottage, which was used as a kitchen in the establishment, two or three more women
                  appeared,—older than Anne and her companions,—and for these, as before, seats were
                  provided on a settle. This last arrangement made a little delay, but so soon as
                  the women were seated, the brisk troubadour went on.</p>
               <p>"When the Count Garin of Beaucaire saw that he could not drag Nicolette out from
                  the heart of Aucassin, he went to find the Viscount, who was his vassal, and he
                  said to him:—</p>
               <p>"'Sir Viscount, we must get rid of your god-child, Nicolette.</p>
               <p>"'Cursed be the country where she was born, for she is the reason why I am losing
                  my Aucassin, who ought to be a knight and who refuses to do what he ought to
                  do.</p>
               <p>"'If I can catch her, I will burn her at the stake, and I will burn you too.'</p>
               <p>"'My Lord,' replied the Viscount, 'I am very sorry for what has happened, but it
                  is no fault of mine.</p>
               <p>"'I bought Nicolette with my money; I trained her; I had her baptized, and she is
                  my god-child.</p>
               <p>"'I wanted to marry her to a fine young man of mine, who would gladly have earned
                  her bread for her, which is more than your son Aucassin could do.</p>
               <p>"'But since your wish and your pleasure are what they are, I will send this
                  god-child of mine away to such a land in, such a country that Aucassin shall never
                  set his eyes upon her again.'"</p>
               <p>The little audience of the troubadour, quite unused to "sensation" of this sort,
                  many of them fresh as children to the charm of a well-told story, pressed closer
                  and closer to him. With the rarest of gifts, and that least possible to gain by
                  study, the trouvèur fairly talked to them in tones of perfect conversational
                  familiarity. His eyes caught sympathizing eyes as he glanced from side to side of
                  the room, and his animation quickened, and his words became more confidential. At
                  last, indeed, he addressed himself personally to the Captain; when he was fully
                  satisfied that, in the confusion which accompanied the entrance of the women, John
                  of Lugio had risen from his quiet seat behind the inner door, and had, unnoticed,
                  left the room.</p>
               <p>The troubadour continued in his most confidential narrative tone,—</p>
               <p>"'See that you do so,' cried the Count Carin to the Viscount, 'or great
                  misfortunes will come to you.'</p>
               <p>"So saying, he left his vassal.</p>
               <p>"Now the Viscount had a noble palace, of high walls, surrounded by a thickly
                  planted garden. He put Nicolette into one of the rooms of this palace, in the very
                  highest story.</p>
               <p>"She had an old woman for her only companion, with enough bread and meat and wine,
                  and everything else that they needed to keep them alive.</p>
               <p>"Then he fastened and concealed the door, so that no one could go in, and he left
                  no other opening but the window, which was very narrow and opened on the
                  garden."</p>
               <p>Again the story-teller nodded to the two girls, and they sang all together. <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Nicolette was put in prison;</l>

                        <l rend="ti-1">Her hair was light,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Her eyes were bright,</l>

                        <l>A mind with such a charming face to see.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l rend="ti-1">She looked into the garden close</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And there she saw-the open rose,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Heard the thrushes sing and twitter,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And she sang in accent bitter:</l>
                        <l>O, why am I a captive here?</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Why locked up in cruel walls?</l>
                        <l>Aucassin, my sweetheart dear,</l>

                        <l>I have been your sweetheart for this livelong year!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">That is why I've come</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">To this vaulted room,</l>
                        <l>But by God, the son of Mary, no!</l>
                        <l>I will not be captured so,</l>
                        <l>If only I can break away, and go!</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then the troubadour continued:—</p>
               <p>"So Nicolette was put in prison, as you have just heard, and soon a cry and noise
                  ran through the country that she was lost. Some said that she had run away; others
                  said that the Count Garin de Beaucaire had killed her.</p>
               <p>"All in despair at the joy which this news seemed to cause to some people,
                  Aucassin went to find the viscount of the town.</p>
               <p>"'Lord Viscount,' he asked him, 'what have you done with Nicolette, my sweetest
                  love, the thing in all the world which I love best?</p>
               <p>"'You have stolen her!</p>
               <p>"'Be sure, Viscount, that if I die of this, the blame shall fall on you.</p>
               <p>"'For, surely, it is you who tear away my life in tearing away my darling
                  Nicolette!</p>
               <p>"'Fair sir,' answered the Viscount, 'do let this Nicolette alone, for she is not
                  worthy of you; she is a slave whom I have bought with my deniers, and she must
                  serve as a wife to a young fellow of her own state, to a poor man, and not to a
                  lord like you, who ought to marry none but a king's daughter, or at least a
                  Count's daughter.</p>
               <p>"'What should you be doing for yourself if you did make a lady of this vile
                  creature, and marry her?</p>
               <p>"'Then would you be very happy, indeed, very happy, for your soul would abide
                  forever in hell. And never should you enter into paradise.'</p>
               <p>"'Into Paradise?' repeated Aucassin, angrily. 'And what have I to do there? I do
                  not care to go there if it be not with Nicolette, my sweetest darling whom I love
                  so much.'</p>
               <p>"'Into Paradise! And do you know who those are that go there, you who think it is
                  a place where I must wish to go? They are old priests, old cripples, old one-eyed
                  men, who lie day and night before the altars, sickly, miserable, shivering, half
                  naked, half fed; dead already before they die! These are they who go to paradise,
                  and they are such pitiful companions that I do not desire to go to paradise with
                  them.'</p>
               <p>"'But to hell would I gladly go; for to hell go the good clerks and the fair
                  knights slain in battle and in great wars; the brave Sergeants-at-Arms and the men
                  of noble lineage. And with all these would I gladly go.'</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6581-00000030"/>
               <p>"'Stop,' says the Viscount; 'all which you can say and nothing at all, are exactly
                  the same thing; never shall you see Nicolette again.</p>
               <p>"'What you and I may get for this, would not be pleasant, if you still will be
                  complaining.</p>
               <p>"'We all might be burned by your father's command,—Nicolette, you, and I myself
                  into the bargain.'</p>
               <p>"'I am in despair!' murmured Aucassin, leaving the Viscount, who was no less angry
                  than himself."</p>
               <p>The company gathered nearer and nearer together, eager not to lose one word. Nor
                  was any one roused from the interest of the story, till a new traveller stopped at
                  the wretched tavern.</p>
               <p>"Holà! holà!" he cried. "Is there no one to care for my horse?"</p>
               <p>Antoine, the stable-boy, rushed out, and to his shame and horror all the horses
                  were gone.</p>
               <p>But with the agony and falsehood of despair, he took the stranger's horse, as if
                  nothing had happened, and said to him:—</p>
               <p>"I will see to the horse, Monsieur, give yourself no care. Will you step into the
                  house? There is the best trouvère singing there, who travels all over this
                  country. He is telling the story of Nicolette.</p>
               <p>"I will take good care of your horse, sir; never fear me."</p>
               <p>For poor Antoine's only fear was, that the master of the newly arrived beast would
                  stay outside.</p>
               <p>In fact that worthy did loiter a moment, and gave one or two directions about his
                  horse. Poor Antoine was dying to ask him if he met five saddled horses as he came.
                  But he did not dare disgrace himself; and he thought, wisely enough, that if the
                  stranger had seen any such cavalcade, he would surely have mentioned it.</p>
               <p>At last, by repeated solicitation, he induced the man to enter the tavern, and,
                  with solicitude wholly unusual, the stable-boy drew the door to, after the
                  traveller had passed in. He could hear the trio again, as the two girls joined
                  with the troubadour.</p>
               <p>But the poor stable-boy cursed Nicolette and Aucassin both, with adjurations and
                  anathemas which they had never learned, and wished all troubadours were on the
                  other side of the sea. If those horses could not be brought back before his
                  master, or before the Viguier's officer found they were gone, he, Antoine, would
                  be well flogged before he went to bed. That was certain. No Christmas holiday for
                  him,—that was certain also. And whether, at the beginning of a cold winter, he
                  were not put in handcuffs and carried to one of those horrid prisons which he had
                  heard the officers talking of; of this the frightened boy was by no means
                  certain.</p>
               <p>So soon as he had closed the door, instead of leading the hot and wet beast,
                  intrusted to him, to the stable, as he knew he should do, he fastened him by the
                  rein firmly but quickly, and at his best speed ran up the road, where he might
                  gain the view from the hill, and get a survey of the whole meadow.</p>
               <p>"For the cursed brutes," he said, "are all fastened together, wherever they have
                  gone."</p>
               <p>And then he reflected, with profound satisfaction, that the tale of Nicolette and
                  Aucassin was very long,—or that one of the girls had told him so in a whisper.
                  Perhaps they would stay in the tavern longer than the Captain had said, if only
                  the troubadour could make it entertaining enough.</p>
               <p>Ah! Antoine, you need not fear the troubadour! He is making it as entertaining as
                  he knows how,—and that is what he is there for,—that he may keep them all for the
                  precious minutes that shall take Cœur-Blanc into Lyons.</p>
               <p>So Antoine pressed up the road to the little swell of land over which it passed,
                  from which, as he approached, John of Lugio had first seen the group standing at
                  the tavern.</p>
               <p>The poor boy came up the hill, all out of breath, and scanned the wide meadows. A
                  few cows here; a stray traveller or two there; clouds of dust on the highway,
                  which might conceal this or that or something else,—who should say? But no
                  definite sign of the horses.</p>
               <p>The wretched boy climbed a tree; but he only lost time, and saw nothing. He could
                  see that Philip of Fontroyes, the lame man, was hobbling home with his sorry
                  cow.</p>
               <p>The boy rushed to meet Philip. Philip was very deaf, and, like other dull people,
                  could not answer the square question put to him, till he knew who he was that
                  asked it, why he asked it, and for what purpose he asked it. When he was at last
                  secure on these points, he ventured to say.—</p>
               <p>"Horses, no horses; no, no horses. There was a span of mules that a man with a red
                  jerkin drove by, that was two hours ago. But no horses."</p>
               <p>As Antoine knew that if Philip had had any eye, or any memory, he must have
                  reported at least the passage of Cœur-Blanc, and that of the troubadour, and that
                  of the stranger whom he had just left; three horses, certainly; this assurance
                  that no horses had passed on the road was anything but encouraging.</p>
               <p>Poor boy! he looked back a moment on the tavern; he thought of the pretty,
                  pleasant way in which Lulu had spoken to him only that morning, and of the blue
                  ribbon he had ready to give to her the next day; he thought, shall we confess it
                  in this connection, of his own feast-day suit of clothes, which were in his box in
                  the wretched attic where he slept.</p>
               <p>But he thought also of the flogging which was so sure if he were detected. He
                  would never see Lulu again, nor his gay garments again! He looked his last on the
                  tavern, and fled along the high road—away from it and from Lyons—as fast as his
                  feet could carry him.</p>
               <p>The troubadour, who saw everything, saw or knew or felt or comprehended the
                  entrance of the newcomer, and heard Antoine as he closed the outer door of the
                  tavern. The troubadour did not pause a moment in his story. The stranger, with a
                  courteous gesture, intimated that he would not interrupt it, and took the seat by
                  the great fire, which Dame Gravier, with a good deal of fuss and pretence of
                  hospitality, cleared for him.</p>
               <p>The Captain of the officers started, as if he had perhaps dozed a little in the
                  last refrain of the singers, but really gave some attention to the story-teller,
                  as he went on without any pause—as the story required him to do—after another
                  little song:— <q>

               <p>To a modern ear it is difficult to give the impression of the effect of the long
                  closing line, as the three voices, in strict unison, closed the little song,—with
                  perfect spirit, running up rapidly in a whole octave, and closing an octave higher
                  than the key-note, to which they would naturally have returned.</p>
               <p>The narrative then continued:—</p>
               <p>"Meanwhile, I can tell you, the fighting went on. For the Count Bougars pressed
                  hard on the Count Garin. He had a thousand men-at-arms in one camp, and he had a
                  thousand in another. And while Aucassin was shut up in his chamber, and lamenting
                  his dear Nicolette, the Count was bringing up great battering-rams to hammer down
                  the walls of the city."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes," grunted the Captain, "let us hear about the battering-rams. I was
                  sergeant in a battering-train at Gron, myself, I was!" And he drank off another
                  good draught from his tankard, and then <choice>
                     <sic>droppng</sic>
                     <corr>dropping</corr>
                  </choice> back in his chair, gave attention in the manner of those people, who can
                  hear a preacher better when their eyes are closed.</p>
               <p>"He brought up one battering-ram, with a very brave sergeant in charge of it, on
                  one side the city; and, on another side, he brought up another with two counts,
                  and a duke in charge of it.</p>
               <p>"At last he thought all was ready, and on each side of the town he gathered all
                  his footmen and all his horsemen for the assault."</p>
               <p>"What did he want horsemen for, to storm a breach with?" growled the sergeant.</p>
               <p>"I beg your honor's pardon," said the trouvère, who had not made the blunder
                  without a purpose. "But the troubadour who told this story to me had not seen so
                  many sieges as your honor."</p>
               <p>"I should think not; I should think not," grunted the drunken critic, well
                  satisfied with the success of his interruption, and the trouvère continued as
                  confidentially as before, and as if the sergeant was his only auditor.</p>
               <p>"Everybody in the city was called to arms to defend the walls. They supposed that
                  the attack would be made on the eastern side, because the breach was there."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," grunted the experienced soldier, "of course the attack would be made
                  where the breach was."</p>
               <p>And he nodded complacently upon the inn-keeper and upon his own companions, as if
                  he would say, "Of course we know more of war than these singing fellows do."</p>
               <p>The troubadour continued:—</p>
               <p>"The principal attacking party might have gone quite wrong had it been left to the
                  dukes, but the brave fellow I told you of before—"</p>
               <p>And it is impossible to tell what wonders the sergeant on his side might have
                  wrought, or the duke and the count on theirs, in vain rivalry with a sergeant so
                  puissant. For at this fatal moment, the horse whom Antoine had left to freeze,
                  thinking it was quite time that his needs should be attended to, gave an ominous
                  neigh.</p>
               <p>"Neigh-eigh-eigh-eigh."</p>
               <p>The sound rang through the crowded room; and Jean the inn-keeper himself started
                  from his seat and looked around, and, seeing that all the servants were rushing
                  out-doors, followed them. The master of the horse of course followed, and the
                  officers; and the troubadour and the girls were left in the confusion alone.</p>
               <p>"Where's Antoine? where's Antoine?" Cries of Antoine! Antoine! resounded
                  everywhere. To tell the truth, the tavern was not unused to such clamor. Poor
                  Antoine was the man-of-all-work, always summoned.</p>
               <p>"Don't come out into the cold, sir!" said Jean Gravier, perfectly used to making
                  up the scanty resources of his wretched tavern by the boldest lying. "Go back into
                  the inn, if you please. My wife has supper ready. Antoine has taken the horses to
                  water them."</p>
               <p>"Water them!" said the stranger, with an oath; "and why has he not taken mine to
                  groom him and give him a bed, as he said he would? The beast is wellnigh frozen
                  already, while you and your people are singing your love-songs."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, certainly," said Jean Gravier, "I shall rub him down myself." And he
                  led the poor wretch to the stable, wondering where Antoine was with the other
                  horses, and beckoning to Ode, one of the hangers-on, to follow.</p>
               <p>"Jean Gravier, come back; what is all this row about, and what are you doing with
                  the horses of the honorable men-at-arms of the Bishop and Chapter of Lyons?"</p>
               <p>With many oaths, some hiccough, and other interruptions, the Captain of the
                  policemen, standing upon the step, thus hailed the tavern-keeper.</p>
               <p>Jean Gravier pretended not to hear.</p>
               <p>"Come back, you dog, come back, and answer to the charge made against you." This
                  was the second appeal of the drunken fool, who doubted a little his own ability to
                  run after the delinquent vintner, and made up in grandeur of words for whatever
                  failure of bodily force he was conscious of.</p>
               <p>Jean Gravier did not dare go on.</p>
               <p>"For God's sake, find the horses, Ode. Send Pierre up the road, and send Andre
                  down; unless, indeed, which God grant, that brute of an Antoine has had the grace
                  to put them all into the stable."</p>
               <p>And, with the happy thought of a new lie, he turned to the stranger, who was
                  following him in a rage, and said,—</p>
               <p>"I did not understand, monsieur. The boy has taken them all to the stable, it was
                  so cold."</p>
               <p>"Took them to the stable! Why did he not take mine to the stable? What do I care
                  for other people's horses? I will groom my own!"</p>
               <p>And, with little comfort, Jean Gravier was left to take the rage of the drunken
                  sergeant.</p>
               <p>But this rage, and the rage of the two officers, who abetted and applauded the
                  threats and abuse of their chief, need not be written down. Jean Gravier bent
                  before the storm, acknowledged that it was natural that<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000032"/> his guests should be indignant, but explained that
                  they were wholly mistaken. He repeated eagerly his lie that the horses were in the
                  stable, praying to all the saints in the calendar that they might prove to be so.
                  In a moment more, he was relieved from the necessity of inventing any more lies by
                  a shout from Andre, who appeared in the roadway, leading out four of the five
                  horses from behind an old mill, which stood perhaps a furlong along the Lyons
                  road, in the direction exactly opposite that which Antoine had taken.</p>
               <p>Ah me! if Antoine had dared ask the stranger if he met five horses saddled, he
                  would have gone the right way when he did go wrong; he would have found the
                  horses; he would have brought them back undetected; he would have given Lulu her
                  ribbon on Christmas day, and would have worn his own fine clothes. And now the
                  poor boy is flying, as if for life, across the meadows.</p>
               <p>Andre came leading along the coffle of horses. For a moment no one observed that
                  there were but four, and should be five; but, the moment he came to the tavern
                  with them, the loss of Cœur-Blanc was evident.</p>
               <p>"It is that damned horse-thief from Meyzieux!" cried Jean Gravier, the
                  tavern-keeper; "and he has stolen the best horse of them all." And Jean Gravier
                  went sadly back into the tavern, to think what lie he should invent to satisfy the
                  quiet gentleman with white hair who sat behind the door.</p>
               <p>But, as the reader knows, the quiet gentleman with white hair had taken leave long
                  before.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>All this time he had been increasing the distance between him and the tavern as
                  rapidly as Cœur-Blanc's longest stride would take him. The sun was yet more than
                  half an hour high, though he had lost certainly half an hour in that miserable
                  altercation, and in the enforced delay in the tavern.</p>
               <p>At the moment when he found himself free, he had not mounted Cœur-Blanc; he had
                  only cut the long halter at the place where it was fastened to the house, and by
                  it had led along the five horses together, as if to the trough where they were
                  used to be watered. If any one within the room heard their tread, he supposed the
                  stable-boys were leading them to the trough, and to the cover which, as evening
                  drew on, they all required. As the other horses drank, John of Lugio mounted his
                  own. Not losing his hold of the halter, he walked carefully two hundred yards or
                  more into the shelter of a little copse and of a deserted mill. Here he stopped,
                  eager for time though he was, and once more securely tethered them all. Then was
                  it that he gave Cœur-Blanc his head; and for the next fifteen minutes he rode like
                  the wind.</p>
               <p>He understood then, what the reader understands, that the troubadour, whose
                  salutation he had acknowledged but whose call he had not regarded, had been acting
                  as his true friend, in an emergency when he had no other.</p>
               <p>The man was one of the affiliated "Poor Men of Lyons." That was made certain by
                  the signal he had given.</p>
               <p>He had recognized John of Lugio, but in that uncertain way that a minute had
                  passed before he was sure of his man. Then was it that the good fellow had been
                  certain that the priest, whom all the "Poor Men of Lyons" loved and honored, was
                  riding ing into danger; and then was it that he had turned and hailed him, in the
                  hope that he might in time save him from the inspection and inquiry of the
                  officers, whom the troubadour had passed just before at the tavern. In truth, he
                  had gladly evaded them himself; for the reputation of the Lyonnais officers was so
                  bad that any man of peace was glad to keep out of the way when it was in his
                  power.</p>
               <p>And now, as Father John saw, the good fellow had boldly come to the rescue, and
                  had taken the chances of sharing his fate, that he might also take the chance of
                  coming to his relief.<ref rend="super" target="#note_003" xml:id="return_003"

                   The priest did not dare think he was safe himself till he crossed the long
                  bridge. But he heard no outcry behind him; and every minute, as Cœur-Blanc flew,
                  was two or three furlongs gained.</p>

                  <p><ref target="#return_003">1</ref>This is no place for an essay on the troubadours or their poetry. But the
                     author may be permitted to say in a few words, that they are not to be
                     dismissed, as they are perhaps too often as if they had no important place
                     in the rapid changes and curious development of the time in which they
                     lived. Every new manuscript disinterred and edited in France tends to raise
                     rather than lower the estimate which is to be formed of their power and
                     their merit.</p>
                  <p>It has already been said that the earliest specimen of their written
                     language which we have is a Scripture poem, and that they were largely
                     occupied in giving a general knowledge of Scripture to the people. In this
                     regard they rendered perhaps, more efficient service than their successors,
                     to whom we give a French name also,—the "colporteurs."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hallam says, "No romances of chivalry and hardly any tales are found in
                     their works." But since Mr. Hallam wrote the "Middle Ages," many of the
                     troubadour books have been discovered and edited. Among them is this curious
                     Aucassin and Nicolette, of which I have transferred the beginning without
                     hesitation to my story; because the critics assure us that the earlier
                     versions of it belonged to the twelfth century.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hallam's estimate of the troubadour poetry is in these words:—</p>
                  <p>"Their poetry was entirely of that class which is allied to music, and
                     excites the fancy or feelings rather by the power of sound than any
                     stimulancy of imagery and passion. Possessing a flexible and harmonious
                     language, they invented a variety of metrical arrangements, perfectly new to
                     the nations of Europe. The Latin hymns were striking but monotonous; the
                     metre of the Northern French unvaried; but in Provençal almost every length
                     of verse from two syllables to twelve, and the most intricate disposition of
                     rhymes, were at the choice of the troubadour. The canzoni, the sestine, all
                     the lyric measures of Italy and Spain, were borrowed from his treasury. With
                     such a command of poetical sounds, it was natural that he should inspire
                     delight into cars not yet rendered familiar to the artifices of verse; and
                     even now the fragments of these ancient lays, quoted by M. Sismondi and M.
                     Ginguené, seem to possess a sort of charm which has evaporated in
                     translation. Upon this harmony, and upon the facility with which mankind are
                     apt to be deluded into an admiration of exaggerated sentiment in poetry,
                     they depended for their influence. And however vapid the songs of Provence
                     may seem to our apprehensions, they were undoubtedly the source from which
                     poetry for many centuries derived a great portion of its habitual
                     language."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Pater has published an interesting essay on this little romance of
                     Aucassin and Nicolette. He says:—</p>
                  <p>"Below this intenser poetry (of Provence) there was probably a wide range of
                     literature, less serious and elevated reaching by lightness of form and
                     comparative homeliness of interest, an audience which the concentrated
                     passion of those higher lyrics left untouched. This literature has long
                     since perished, or lives only in later French or Italian versions. One such
                     version the only representative of its species, M. Fauriel thought he
                     detected in the story of Aucassin and Nicolette, written in the French of
                     the latter half of the thirteenth century, and preserved in a unique
                     manuscript in the national library of Paris; and there were reasons which
                     made him divine for it a still more ancient ancestry.</p>
                  <p>"The writer himself calls the piece a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">cante
                     fable,</foreign> a tale told in prose, but with its incidents and
                     sentiment helped forward by songs inserted at irregular intervals. In the
                     junctions of the story itself there are signs of roughness and want of skill
                     which make one suspect that the prose was only put together to connect a
                     series of songs,—a series of songs so moving and attractive that people
                     wished to heighten and dignify their effect by a regular framework or
                     setting. Yet the songs themselves are of the simplest kind, not rhymed even,
                     but only imperfectly assonant, stanzas of twenty or thirty lines, all ending
                     with a similar vowel sound. And here, as elsewhere in that early poetry,
                     much of the interest is in the spectacle of the formation of a new artistic
                     sense.</p>
                  <p>"A new music is arising, the music of rhymed poetry, and in the songs of
                     Aucassin and Nicolette, which seem always on the point of passing into true
                     rhyme, but which halt somehow, and can never quite take flight, you see
                     people just growing aware of the elements of a new music in their
                     possession, and anticipating how pleasant such music might become.</p>
                  <p>"The piece was probably intended to be recited by a company of trained
                     performers, many of whom, at least for the lesser parts, were probably
                     children. The songs are introduced by the rubric, 'Or se cante,' 'ici on
                     chante,' and each division of the prose, by the rubric, 'or dient et content
                     et fablioient,' 'ici on conte.'"</p>

               <p>Fortunately the high road was, for a while, quite clear of passengers; so that the
                  tremendous rate at which he rode challenged but little attention.</p>
               <p>Fifteen minutes may have passed before he dared take a pace less noticeable; and
                  by that time the spires of Lyons were in sight in the distance. He satisfied
                  himself that the sun was still high enough for him to pass without challenge at
                  the drawbridge. And then, still keeping up a bold trot, he joined with one and<pb
                     n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6581-00000033"/> another group of those who were going
                  into the city, and even ventured to chat with some of them as to the festivities
                  which were in preparation. The Chapter was giving more distinction than ever to
                  Christmas celebration, perhaps to signalize the advantages which the people of
                  Lyons and the neighborhood were to gain from the new arrangement of affairs, which
                  made them temporal masters of the city and suburbs, as well as their spiritual
                  guides.</p>
               <p>Father John felt a little sheltered when he rode chatting by the side of a
                  well-to-do farmer, who was coming in by invitation to spend the holiday with his
                  brother in the city. In front of them was a rude cart, covered with canvass, in
                  which were the farmer's daughters and his wife. The talk fell, as it always did,
                  on the crusade; and the man showed ignorance of the deepest dye as to its
                  geography and its causes, which the priest did his best to enlighten.</p>
               <p>"And will the knights be back, with the heathen hounds by Easter?"</p>
               <p>"The good God knows," replied the priest, reverently.</p>
               <p>"Yes; the good God knows, but what do you think? They have been gone long."</p>
               <p>"It is a long journey," said the priest.</p>
               <p>"Not so long, though, as those fine Englishmen had come, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"O," said Father John, surprised a little, "much longer!"</p>
               <p>"Longer than they had come? Why did they cross the sea at all then? Why not go by
                  land?"</p>
               <p>Father John explained that England was on an island; that if the king of England
                  left his dominions at all he must cross the seas.</p>
               <p>"And do King Saladin, and the foul fiend Mahomed,—do they live on another island?
                  I believe," said the stout farmer, "I should have gone to the Holy War myself, if
                  I could have gone by land."</p>
               <p>Father John exclaimed again that the Holy City was not on an island; that it could
                  be reached by land.</p>
               <p>"In the old war," said he, "many of the knights went by land. They rode their good
                  horses all the way. But so many perished that the kings have taken ship this time,
                  to go thither more quickly."</p>
               <p>"O!" cried his friend, "they are all wrong. Many men would go by land who never
                  would go by sea. I am one. Philippe there is two. Jean, Hubert, Joseph,—I could
                  tell you seven men who would go were there no sailing."</p>
               <p>The priest listened kindly, but the pace to which the good farmer held him was
                  such that he dared not loiter long. He bade him good-by, and pressed on, to join
                  one and another group of people, who were attracted in the same way to the
                  city.</p>
               <p>But always he was expecting to hear the challenge from behind of the Viguier's
                  officers.</p>
               <p>The last obstruction of all was, as he waited in a corner of the road, that a
                  company of a hundred or more mounted soldiers might march past him, who were the
                  men for whom his persecutors had ridden in advance, that they might provide their
                  quarters for the night at Meyzieux. The priest waited till the last of them had
                  gone, and then boldly crossed the causeway over the meadow before they came to the
                  temporary bridge, where he was to pass the Rhone for the last time,—the bridge
                  which poor Prinhac had crossed so fortunately in the morning. The sun was glowing,
                  red and angry, above the height of Fourvières, and Father John had again so far
                  relaxed the rate of speed to which he had held the horse, that his more decorous
                  trot did not attract the attention of the town-servants, who were farmers' boys,
                  and were going out of the town that they might enjoy the festival of the next day
                  at their fathers' homes, or that of the groups of peasants who were pressing in to
                  see the great solemnities by which the chapter celebrated the Saviour's birth, and
                  amused their subjects at the same time. There were, indeed, so many of these
                  parties now, and they proceeded at a rate so confidently slow, that, had the
                  priest any doubt whether he should find the gates open, the number of travellers
                  would have reassured him.</p>
               <p>At the bridge itself, there was not even the pretence of any examination or
                  detention. So many of the towns people and of the peasants were passing in or
                  passing out, that it seemed to be taken as an exceptional day, when the usual
                  forms of military order might be relaxed, and the sentinel, who was lazily sitting
                  on a bench by the portcullis, with his halberd lying by his side, did not so much
                  as challenge the passers-by. Father John, who had heard from Prinhac the story of
                  the secret of his passage, looked rather curiously into the face of this man, and
                  of his officer also, who was lounging in the guard-house behind him. But he
                  recognized neither of them. They certainly were none whom he had known among the
                  clients of his "Poor Men of Lyons," and probably both belonged to some hireling
                  company of soldiers whom the chapter had imported from another province.</p>
               <p>The priest had picked his way across the bridge slowly and with caution, and now
                  entered upon ground where every house was familiar to him, and had some story of
                  grief or joy in his old memories. The streets were more alive than usual, because
                  the Eve of the Festival of Christmas was almost as much a holiday as was the
                  Christmas day proper. And Father John was well aware, that, had he been dressed in
                  the proper uniform of his profession, any fifth person he met would have
                  recognized him as one of the proscribed men. Recognition was dangerous at the
                  best; but to night an arrest by some officer of the Viguier would make delay long
                  enough to defeat any hope of his rendering the service he had been sent for. He
                  had therefore, in the little distance left to him, as he threaded the streets of
                  the town, a greater risk to run than he had incurred the whole day through. His
                  risk was his patient's risk, and he must avoid it as best he could.</p>
               <p>The priest looked eagerly among the groups of people who were gathered at the
                  street corners, in the hope that there might be some one known to him as belonging
                  to the affiliated "Poor Men of Lyons," whom he should dare withdraw from the crowd
                  by a signal, who would take the well-known horse he rode quietly to its<pb
                     n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6581-00000034"/> master's stables, while he himself found
                  his way to the house on foot, and so escape observation. But the handful of the
                  "Poor Men" who were in Lyons did not care much for such street gatherings, nor,
                  indeed, were they greatly interested in such celebrations of Christmas as the
                  Abbot had prepared. The priest was obliged to turn from the public square into a
                  narrow by-street, less crowded with curious idlers. He dismounted from his horse,
                  and led him by the bridle, and so approached a group of boys who were lounging in
                  the open gateway of a tradesman's court-yard. He held out a copper coin in his
                  hand, and said. "Which of you will take my horse across the little bridge for me?
                  This is for him."</p>
               <p>"That is not your horse. That is Messer Jean Waldo's horse, and no one rides him
                  honestly, but Jean Waldo or his groom."</p>
               <p>This was the impudent reply of the largest boy of the group. And all of them
                  seemed, not indifferent to his money, but afraid of the errand. To be found with a
                  stolen horse, as Lyons was then governed, might cost any boy his Christmas
                  holiday, and, very likely, more.</p>
               <p>The priest's imperturbable balance did not leave him. "It is Jean Waldo's horse,
                  and it is to Jean Waldo's stable that I ask you to take him. Do I not pay enough?"
                  Here is another of the Archbishop's croziers. And he took out another piece of
                  money.</p>
               <p>The bribe was a temptation. But the fear of the Courier was stronger; and the
                  second boy answered, with a coarse oath, that the traveller had better take his
                  own horses, and groom them too. And both these precocious young rascals, as if
                  they were compromising the dignity of Lyons by so long talk with a dusty
                  countryman, then gave a loud battle howl known to the other gamins of their
                  section, and rushed wildly to the square, from which John of Lugio had just now
                  turned. Two smaller boys, who made the rest of the group, seemed disposed to
                  follow them, when the priest, perhaps because he must run some risk, perhaps
                  because the purer faces of these boys attracted him, bent down, and said, almost
                  in a whisper, "Could you take this horse to Jean Waldo's 'for the love of
                  Christ'?"</p>
               <p>"I will go anywhere," said the brave fellow, clambering into the saddle, "when I
                  am summoned 'IN HIS NAME.'"</p>
               <p>"You are to say, boy, that he who was sent for is close at hand."</p>
               <p>"I am to say, that he who was sent for is close at hand. Farewell."</p>
               <p>The boy was gone; and the priest, through court-yard and arched ways where he
                  could not have ridden, hastily crossed the peninsula, crossed the bridge which
                  spanned the narrower river of the two, and, in two or three minutes after the boy
                  had given warning of his approach, he met Giulio the Florentine at Jean Waldo's
                  door.</p>

               <p>THE master and his pupil fell on each other's necks, and kissed each other without
                  one word. It was five years since they had met, and communication munication by
                  letter or by message was most infrequent. And then the first words of both were
                  for their patient.</p>
               <p>"How does she bear herself?" These were the priest's first words.</p>
               <p>"She is living. At least I can say that. I do not know if I can say anything more.
                  At every hour her pulse is quicker and weaker, and her breathing worse. But there
                  are now hardly any of the convulsions of agony. Do you remember that night with
                  the boatmen at Anse? This girl has suffered as those men did not suffer."</p>
               <p>"Does she know you?"</p>
               <p>"She knows no one, and no thing. But she talks now to her 'dear mountain,' now to
                  some old lame beggar, now to King Saladin, now to her cousin Gabrielle."</p>
               <p>"She is living over the life of the hour before she took the drug. That is the way
                  with these poisons."</p>
               <p>These few words passed as they entered and crossed the court-yard, and mounted the
                  stairway to the poor sufferer's pretty room.</p>
               <p>In that day of the infancy of medical science, the distinctions among poisons now
                  observed were quite unknown, even to the most learned. Poisons are now
                  distinguished as irritants, narcotics, narcotic acrid, or septic, according as
                  they act, by one or another method of injury on the human organization. The wild
                  hemlock-like parsley, which grows abundantly in the meadows of Southern France,
                  and which had been so carelessly substituted for some innocent root by Goodwife
                  Prudhon, is one of the poisons known as narcotic acrid. In the eagerness of
                  Mistress Waldo to make her preparation strong, she had even let the powder of the
                  root itself remain in her decoction; and the child, in her conscientious desire to
                  do all her mother wished, even because the medicine was so nauseous, had, alas,
                  drank all the drugs of the preparation, as well as the more innocent liquid. The
                  Florentine would be called only an empiric by the science of to-day; that is to
                  say, only a person who acts on the remembrance of the results of his observations.
                  He would himself have confessed that he was little more. But his observations had
                  been wide and intelligent. Since he was a child, the laws of life, and the methods
                  of life, had fascinated him. And what he had seen of sickness and of health he had
                  noted with absolute precision, and he had remembered thoroughly. When he wrote to
                  his master that he suspected that the women had mixed one of the poisonous
                  mushrooms of the valley of the Rhone in with their hemlock-brewing, it was because
                  he had already detected symptoms, which were not to be accounted for, by the mere
                  action of the root which he had identified in the mother's stores. These anomalous
                  symptoms had, through the day, asserted themselves. And the Florentine, as it
                  would seem, had varied his treatment somewhat from that with which he began. None
                  the less, however, was the patient sinking. The balance and force of her admirable
                  constitution, and her life of perfect purity, asserted themselves all along. But
                  every symptom showed that she had less strength with every hour.</p>
               <p>John of Lugio came to the bedside, and received silently, with a kind smile, the
                  eager and profoundly respectful salutation of the child's father. Jean Waldo was
                  surprised indeed. It seemed that this master of the young Giulio, this man so much
                  hoped for and longed for, in this day<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6581-00000035"/> of
                  agony and of prayer, was one of those daily companions of his kinsman, Peter
                  Waldo, whom he had, fifty times, seen with him at his home or at his store-house.
                  For all of those companions, Jean Waldo's contempt had been even more bitter than
                  that with which he regarded his kinsman. For he looked upon these men as being the
                  tempters who lured the merchant into the follies outside his vocation. And now, as
                  God ordered, it was this very man for whom he had sent his servants and his
                  horses, for whom he had defied the law of Lyons, and for whose coming he had been
                  hoping and praying all that day!</p>
               <p>Madame Waldo rose from her chair at the bedside, and yielded it to the stranger,
                  with a respectful courtesy. But, for a minute, no word was spoken in the room.</p>
               <p>The new physician did not put his chilled hand upon pulse or forehead. He bent his
                  ear close enough above the child's heart to listen to her faint breathing. He
                  tried to catch the odor of her breath as it passed from her nostrils. He brought
                  the candle closer to her that he might note the complexion of her face; and even
                  threw it upon the open and rather rigid eye, which looked upon him so
                  unnaturally.</p>
               <p>Then he turned to his pupil, and asked in detail what he had tried to do for
                  her.</p>
               <p>The reader knows something of this already. Madame Waldo and her neighbors knew
                  enough of the not mistaken medical practice of their time, to give to the
                  suffering child full potions of oil stirred in with hot water as soon as they
                  found that she had swallowed poison. Nor had they been unsuccessful in relieving
                  her stomach from much of the decoction, and from a part even of the dregs of the
                  draught which she had taken. But, as Giulio had found, the root and whatever was
                  mingled with it had so long lodged themselves in her system, that the poison was,
                  in a measure, absorbed by her organization; and the convulsions which made her
                  father and mother so miserable, were the proof that they had not succeeded in
                  removing all or most of the cause of her suffering.</p>
               <p>"The convulsions never lasted long," said the young man to his master, "but they
                  left her deadly pale, her face all haggard, and they came again as if we did
                  nothing. Once and again I found it hard to open her mouth, so firmly set were her
                  jaws. I have been all day long keeping up this warmth and rubbing, on which the
                  women had begun. Her pulse seemed to me so exceptional, that at noon, I ventured
                  to draw blood, which we have saved for you to see. It is here. And it is now six
                  times, at intervals of an hour perhaps, that I have given to her this bone black
                  which I had ready. I made it myself by the burning of sea-gulls' bones, and I know
                  that it is unmixed, and that there is no vegetable in it. But whether it has
                  absorbed anything, I dare not say. I have hesitated about giving wine to one from
                  whom I was drawing blood. But when I could hardly find her pulse, and could hardly
                  see her breath upon the mirror, I gave her Bourdeaux wine, such as you see here,
                  and it seemed to me to do no harm. I renewed this twice therefore. And I have
                  given her also, three or four times to-day, this camomile which her mother has
                  served for me."</p>
               <p>The Master nodded sympathetically, in approval or in assent, and, when his pupil
                  showed to him the camomile, drained the bowl himself. He returned it to Dame Waldo
                  with a smile, the first smile which any one had seen in that room for twenty-four
                  hours, and the first indication which he had given that he was not wholly
                  discouraged by the situation. The mother at least was encouraged. The new
                  physician had thus entered on his work at that point, which is by no means the
                  least important of a physician's duties, the care of the family of his patient.
                  The good woman suddenly recollected that a man who had ridden fifteen leagues on a
                  winter day, might be in want of some refreshment, and, only delighted that there
                  was anything that she could do, retired instantly to her maids and her kitchen, to
                  do what she then reflected she should have done before, and take order for his
                  evening meal.</p>
               <p>John of Lugio himself crossed to the open fireplace, and sat opposite the blaze,
                  warming his cold hands over the embers. He asked the young Florentine one and
                  another questions, called, himself, for the barks and leaves which the women had
                  used in their pharmacy, and which still lay on broad salvers in a little
                  antechamber. So soon as he was sure that his cold touch would not chill the girl,
                  he went back to the bedside, assured himself as to the circulation in her feet and
                  hands, listened at the beating of the heart, and noted the wiry pulsation of her
                  wrists, and then with his own hand poured into the silver cup five times as much
                  of the wine of Bordeaux as his pupil had dared to use. He then administered the
                  whole draught to the girl, with a practised hand, and a sort of command in his
                  manner which, even in her torpor, she obeyed.</p>
               <p>"Do not disturb her. Let her lie," he said. And they both withdrew again to the
                  fire.</p>
               <p>"You relieve me more than I can say," said the young man. I have been haunted all
                  the afternoon with the remembrance of Gerbert's axiom—"</p>
               <p>"Which you have had the good sense to violate. Perhaps the child owes her life to
                  your rebellion. The Pope Sylvester has learned something since he wrote out his
                  axioms, and you and I must not be frightened by dead popes more than by living
                     ones.<ref rend="super" target="#note_004" xml:id="return_004">*</ref>
                   Your stimulant has done her no harm that I can see. And if she is to
                  rally, we must help her if we can. Let me see your hamper there, and let us be
                  ready to follow up your treatment with some elixir a little more prompt than my
                  good friend's sour wines."</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_004">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_004">*</ref>Gerbert, distinguished as a French naturalist, was afterwards Pope Sylvester

               </note>
               <p>The blackamoor drew to the side of the fireplace a small table, and with his
                  master's help brought from the basket a varied collection of flasks and bottles,
                  which he set in order on it. The master looked at the labels on these in their
                  order,—sometimes unstopped a flask and poured a few drops into the hollow of his
                  left hand, and tasted them, set aside two of the phials, and then bade the black
                  repack the others; and take them all away. Then turning to Giulio with a renewal
                  of the sweet and half-quizzical smile, which had lighted up his face when he drank
                  off the potion of camomile, he said, "Have you gone back into the dark ages? I
                  have not seen such medicines since our great Bernhard died, because he had no
                  better. I should think we were Adam and Eve in<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000036"/> Paradise, and that Adam drank what Eve brewed."</p>
               <p>"Dear master," said the Florentine,"remember where you are, and, first of all,
                  speak lower. We are in the Dark Ages again, and, under the shadow of this
                  cathedral, we are in the darkest centre of the dark ages. Why, my dear master, to
                  speak of Averroes in any presence where one should be reported to the Courier,
                  would be to sign the order for one's own exile to your mountains. And, though I
                  might speak of Abulcasis, it is because no one in Lyons but yourself has ever
                  heard of his name. No, we are to live and die by Eve's simples, exactly as we are
                  to be saved or to be damned by Pope Alexander's theology. I have hoarded my
                  essences and elixirs, drop by drop. And the little phials you have set aside here,
                  are all that are left of the stores I rescued, the day when the tipstaves of the
                  Viguier emptied your workroom into the street. I would fain have carried away your
                  precious alembics, but the Archbishop's men were before me, and they all went to
                  the palace."</p>
               <p>"To the palace?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose they went to the palace; perhaps they went to the dungheap; perhaps
                  they went as a present to Muley Pasha. There is not a man in Lyons outside this
                  room who knows their inestimable worth, nor how to handle them!"</p>
               <p>"To the palace?" said Father John again, quite regardless of his pupil's last
                  words, and almost as if he were dreaming himself. "To the palace! yes; to the
                  palace!" Then he turned to Madame Gabrielle, who came in gently, and placed on the
                  disencumbered table at his side a salver covered with a napkin and crowded with
                  warm drinks, savory soup, and meat hot from her broiler. "I hope your worship is
                  not faint," she said.</p>
               <p>"My worship is better," he answered, with that same tender smile, "because I think
                  that your darling here is no worse. Such prayers as you have offered for her, and,
                  I think, such prayers as she has offered for herself, are profiting her well, and
                  such care as you and my friend have given her this day, are fit companions to such
                  prayers." As he spoke these gentle words, none the less did the physician-priest
                  turn to the potage which the good dame had prepared for him. And he ate it with
                  the appetite, not of a scholastic, but of a hunter or a soldier. As he ate, he
                  went on in his talk with the Florentine, wholly regardless of the presence of the
                  mother, who stood with her napkin on her arm as if she were a servant, noting
                  every spoonful and every salt-grain of his hasty repast.</p>
               <p>"To the palace, you say—to the palace! Do you mean to tell me, Giulio, that there
                  is nobody here who cares for the Eternal Truth of things? Is there nobody who
                  cares for the way God made the world? Where are all the old set—Lambert, Etienne,
                  Suger, Montereau, Marly, and le Laboureur—where are they all? And your friends,
                  the 'sacred five,' as you youngsters called yourselves? Alas! I answer my own
                  question. Étienne and Marly were dead before the bad times came. Lambert and Suger
                  are in Bohemia with our friend, because these people here know not The Truth, and
                  The Truth knows them not. Montereau, they told me, went to the Holy War. He will
                  come back, knowing something more perhaps. Would God they all had gone thither
                  with as noble purpose!"</p>
               <p>"And le Laboureur, sir, has burned his books and broken his instruments, and
                  joined the Benedictines yonder in Cornillon. Of the sacred five you asked for, I
                  only am left to tell you. George is under the Mediterranean. Hugh is with the
                  Emperor, the others are at Acre, I hope,—they are in the East, as I had wellnigh
                  been myself this day.</p>
               <p>"No, my master; Lyons, I tell you, is the darkest spot of the Dark Ages."</p>
               <p>The nurse at the bedside spoke at this moment, and the priest crossed to his
                  patient. The child was more restive, and her stomach seemed likely to reject the
                  draught which he had given her. He gave to her mother some direction as to her
                  position, and the clothes upon her stomach, and, with quite another tone, came
                  back to his pupil. "Give her thirty drops from this," he said, giving to him one
                  of the reserved phials upon the table. "but it is a sin that we must poison her
                  with sour wine, when we want to give her an elixir. Do you tell me that if love
                  will not give us two hundred drops of the Elixir of the formula of Arnauld or
                  Abulcasis, money will not, do it? Has no man flask, phial, jar, or nutshell filled
                  with it?"</p>
               <p>"No one, my master, since the tipstaves broke into the warehouse of Simon Cimchi,
                  and poured his precious elixirs into the gutter."</p>
               <p>"No one," repeated the other, slowly; "no one except—in the palace. The archbishop
                  knows his right hand from his left, and knows an elixir from a decoction. He has
                  gone on the fool's errand. Who is in his place?"</p>
               <p>The Florentine was not expert in ecclesiastical matters, and called Jean Waldo
                  himself, who had sat silently at his daughter's bedside, to put to him his
                  master's question: "Who holds the primacy of Lyons in the archbishop's absence in
                  the East?" Giulio would have said that morning that, whether it were one priest or
                  another, it mattered nothing to him.</p>
               <p>Jean Waldo replied respectfully, that Father Stephen of St. Amour was the dean of
                  the chapter, and acted as the archbishop's substitute. But he said that he was now
                  absent in Burgundy on a visit with his family, and that the senior canon, one
                  Father William, held his place. Jean Waldo knew that it was he who took the
                  archbishop's place in the high solemnity of Christmas.</p>
               <p>"William of St. Bonnet, perhaps; William of Roux, perhaps; William of Chapinel,
                  perhaps; William of Cologne, perhaps. I remember them all, and there is not one of
                  them all but will know my sign-manual. Giulio, will you take a message to this
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">locum tenentem,</foreign> this archbishop <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">pro tempore?</foreign>" And as he spoke he wrote rapidly on his
                  tablets.</p>
               <p>"You would not dare, my master?"</p>
               <p>"The child's stomach will not bear your watery wine. But all the child wants is as
                  much stimulant within as you have been giving to her skin without. In the
                  archbishop's medicine-chests are doubtless my precious elixirs, and Cimchi's, I do
                  not doubt, as well. If the archbishop himself were here, there would be no danger.
                  He can handle an alembic as well as I can.</p>
               <p>"As for daring, boy, to the child of God there is no danger. I came here 'for the
                  love of Christ.' 'For the love of Christ' I shall bid this servant of Christ send
                  to this child this elixir. You will not refuse to<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000037"/> go, he will not refuse to give; if then the Lord
                  pleases to give his blessing to our stumbling endeavor, all will be well. At the
                  least, we will do our best, and make our endeavor IN HIS NAME."</p>
               <p>The Florentine said no other word, but rose, bowed, and took the parchment. There
                  was written there this missive:—</p>

               <p>And at the bottom of the letter was the rough design of the cross of Malta.</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Giulio the Florentine took the letter, crossed the court-yard, and, as he went,
                  threw over him the black student's gown, which he had left in the hall as he came
                  up to the ministration which had held him here all day. He was amazed, himself, at
                  the confidence with which he undertook an office so strange. Had anybody told him
                  he was to go on such an errand, he would have said that the errand was absurd, and
                  that success in it was impossible. But now that he had it to do, the confidence of
                  his master gave him confidence,—nay, even the absolute necessity of success made
                  him sure that he should not fail. It was clear that the master thought that unless
                  this Elixir of Cordova could be found, and found soon, their battle was lost; that
                  the child would not rally unless some stimulant could be used, more precisely
                  adjusted, and more highly concentrated than any he had bad at command.</p>
               <p>On the strangest duty, therefore, as he knew, that ever he had been engaged in,
                  the student left the weaver's court-yard; but still with the certainty of success.
                  A few steps uphill, and he was within sound of the evening chant, as in the
                  newly-finished nave of the Cathedral church of St. John, the whole chapter and the
                  great company of subordinate priests were engaged in the first of the series of
                  services of the great festival. The nave itself, the porch and the street in
                  front, were crowded with people, and the young man saw that entrance there was
                  impossible. He passed round the church to a little side portal, which gave
                  entrance to a vestry which adjoined the chancel, and there he pressed for
                  entrance.</p>
               <p>He did not find it difficult to enter the room itself. For in the general
                  enthusiasm and general confusion, all the minor clergy, and all the attendants and
                  sacristans, of one tribe and another, had passed up to doorways and other
                  openings, where they could see the pageant within,—and the Florentine soon found
                  himself in the back of this throng, one of a crowd of half-official spectators. He
                  chose his man instantly among these, and chose, as it proved, not unwisely. He
                  whispered to a tall priest, who stood looking over the heads of the crowd in
                  front, and spoke to him in that dialect of rustic Latin which was already passing
                  into Italian in his own country. It proved that the priest was, as he suspected he
                  was, his countryman, and understood him.</p>
               <p>"I need," whispered Giulio, "to speak, at this moment, to his reverence the
                  Dean."</p>
               <p>"Impossible!" said the other, amazed at his presumption; "you see it is
                  impossible. Yonder is the acting Dean in the Archbishop's chair. A moment more,
                  and he will advance to the Eagle."</p>
               <p>"Apud homines hoe impossibleest; apud Deum autem omnia possibilia sunt," replied
                  the bold Florentine, still in a whisper. "It is impossible with men; but with God,
                  all things are possible. "The good-natured priest turned, with surprise, to see
                  what man he was who quoted Scripture so happily and reverently.</p>
               <p>"I tell you, my friend," persisted Giulio, eagerly, "I tell you I have that for
                  the Canon William to see which is life and death,—perhaps for him, for aught I
                  know,—certainly for others. He will not thank the man who keeps me away from
                  him!"</p>
               <p>"Who keeps thee away!" said the other, almost with scorn. "Enter if you can. You
                  see it is impossible, at least for you and me. Hush, now, hush, you see he is
                  kneeling at the Eagle."</p>
               <p>The Eagle was the gilded Eagle, on whose outstretched wings lay the beautiful
                  missal book, from which the Senior Canon, in place of the Dean and the Archbishop,
                  was about to read his part in the service. With a clear and earnest voice he
                  began.</p>
               <p>"For the love of Christ, my friend," said Giulio, speaking almost aloud to his
                  companion, "let us press in together. We two can reach his reverence with this
                  missive. What is there that two of us cannot do if we attempt it IN HIS NAME?"</p>
               <p>The eagerness with which he spoke, in truth, and the invocation which he used,
                  swept the other away. Scarcely knowing what he did, scarcely knowing that he
                  exercised authority upon those that stood around, the father touched one and
                  another of them, with command, as if he also had a part in the appointed
                  service,—as, indeed, he had, if ever any man had special part in sacred ritual. So
                  decided was his manner, that those in front of him instinctively obeyed. To his
                  own surprise, and to Giulio's indeed, they were standing, in a moment more, in the
                  front rank of the crowd of clergy who were looking in reverently upon the
                  solemnity. The Florentine, at the instant, was inspired. One of those great
                  impulses seized him, which do not often come to a man in a lifetime,—when he is
                  swept away by a Life and Power larger than his own, and acts without fear or
                  hesitation, though on a stage which he has never trodden before, and in a scene to
                  which he has never looked forward. Taking his unknown guide by the hand, Giulio
                  boldly walked across the brilliant chancel in face of the immense assembly,
                  passing confidently among the kneeling priests, who were in their several places,
                  till he came to the Eagle, and to the side of the Arch-Canon William as he knelt
                  there. The priest instinctively fell on his knees at one side, while the student
                  knelt on the other. To the clergy, each in his appointed place, this movement was
                  of course inexplicable, and it was a surprise. To the great body of the assembly,
                  however, it was equally inexplicable; but it was no surprise.<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000038"/> To them it was only a part of the great pageant, of
                  which all the solemnity impressed and awed them, while they did not pretend to
                  know the purpose of its several details.</p>
               <p>The acting Archbishop himself was not aware of the neighborhood of these two
                  new-comers. Completely carried away by the spirit of the service in which he was
                  engaged, scarcely conscious of the presence of any of those around him, simply
                  eager to carry to the multitude before him the true sense of the Scripture he was
                  reading, and in his heart praying all the time for Divine Help that he might so
                  render those sacred words that, even in this ancient Latin, these people might, in
                  a measure, understand their import, the good father passed from point to point of
                  the lesson, and only paused for the interludes which had been arranged to be
                  played on the great organ, whose notes in this new-built Cathedral were still a
                  novelty. The priest on one side, and the Florentine on the other, offered no
                  interruption to his sacred service.</p>
               <p>But, in a moment, the prelate had finished his reading, and the "organists of the
                  Hallelujah," four priests who sang, in parts, a portion of the mass arranged for
                  them, took up their service. As the prelate, awed by the solemnity of his own
                  words, lifted his head from the bent attitude in which he had been reading, the
                  Florentine touched him lightly on the shoulder, and said to him in Latin:—</p>
               <p>"It is 'For the Love of Christ' that I am here and speak to you. A dying girl
                  needs your help, and I am bidden to come to call you IN HIS NAME."</p>
               <p>There was not a priest of the lesser degree in the great circle around, but was
                  chafing with indignation and amazement as he witnessed the utterly unauthorized
                  intrusion which had been made in the very crisis of the great solemnity. But to
                  William, who was the central officer in it all, whose whole heart was glowing with
                  one eager wish that this people might understand how a child born in a manger
                  might yet be the Prince of Peace, how the Lord of lords and King of kings might
                  yet minister in the humblest offices, it seemed in this interruption as if the
                  Holy Spirit had sent the immediate present answer to his yearning prayer; and
                  when, in the language of Holy Writ itself, with the great invocation which had
                  worked all miracles from the beginning, man spoke to him, he answered
                  immediately,—</p>
               <p>"Ecce adsum Domine"; and, to the Florentine, he added, "quo ducas sequar,"—"Lord,
                  I am here; where thou leadest, I will follow." At the moment, seeing the priest
                  Alexander at his other side, he counted his presence also as a part of the vision
                  or miracle which surrounded him; he touched him, in turn, and pointed to him the
                  place of the reading on the open missal-book on the Eagle; intimated to him that
                  he was to go on with the service when the organists of the Hallelujah were done,
                  and so followed the Florentine out from the brilliant chancel, threading his way
                  among the kneeling ranks of the amazed clergy, and came with him into the narrow
                  crypts of the darker vestry. A crowd of officers of the church, from sacristans up
                  to canons, of those waiting at the doors, turned and pressed around them; but
                  their chief waved them back to the chancel. "Leave me alone with the messenger,"
                  he said, "and let the service of Nöel not be abated, not in one syllable of the
                  office."</p>
               <p>Then he turned to the Florentine, and almost whispered to him, "Adsum et
                  sequar,"—"I am here, and I will follow."</p>
               <p>"Your grace need not follow," said the young man, who was only surprised that he
                  was not surprised at all that was passing. The truth is, that any actor in one of
                  those waves of inspiration, in which true men are buoyed up together by the Holy
                  Spirit, only feels that the whole is entirely what must be and should be; and his
                  only wonder is that such strength and simplicity are not the law of all life.
                  "Your grace need not follow. If your grace will read this message, that is
                  all."</p>
               <p>Father William glanced at the scrap of vellum which the young man gave him, looked
                  from the top to the bottom, saw the invocation "For the Love of Christ," and the
                  appeal "In His Name"; saw the signature of the old companion of his novitiate,
                  John of Lugio, and saw the Cross of Malta, the significance of which among the
                  initiates he well knew. The awe, which had controlled him from the beginning of
                  the appeal made to him, was not diminished as his eye caught these words. He still
                  felt that he was under Sacred Guidance, and read the letter once and again.</p>
               <p>"O, my brother!" he said, then, with a sad sigh, "our brother asks what I am
                  powerless to give. If our brother Stephen of St. Amour were here, he understands
                  the Archbishop's alembics and elixirs. Even William of Cologne has some novice's
                  notion of them. But I—I am but a child—nor do I even dare open the cloister room
                  where these things are, lest I wake spirits that I cannot lay."</p>
               <p>"If your worship will pardon me, I have studied of these elixirs with the very men
                  with whom the Archbishop has studied." In that sacred presence, the Florentine
                  would not name paynim <choice>
                     <sic>oounds</sic>
                     <corr/>
                  </choice> like Abulcasis and Averroes. "If your grace will only lead to the
                  cloister, I will decide. 'Ecce adsum, quo ducas sequar,'" citing his own words of
                  the moment before.</p>
               <p>"As the Lord will. 'For the Love of Christ,' I do what you bid me. And service
                  cannot be mistaken, which is rendered 'In His Name.'"</p>
               <p>So saying, the prelate took from the sconce one of the large consecrated candles
                  which furnished the light to the dim vestry, and bade the student take the other.
                  They left the room in darkness, and, with these strange flaring torches, they
                  crossed the court-yard to the amazement of the grooms in attendance, and entered
                  by the Archbishop's private door to the corridor of his apartments, to the equal
                  astonishment of the porter on duty there. The palace of the Archbishop was one of
                  the grandest and most beautiful buildings then in France. As the young man stood
                  in the magnificent hall of entrance, he wondered at the richness and beauty of its
                  sculptures. After a moment's pause the Canon joined him again, coming out from his
                  chamber with a heavy bunch of keys, and led the way to the corridor to the very
                  end. He quickly turned the key in the lock, and said to Giulio, with a sweet
                  smile,—</p>
               <p>"To this moment. I have believed that I might be in a dream—nesciebam rem veram
                  esse quod fiebat per angelum, sed putabam me visum videre."<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_005" xml:id="return_005">*</ref>
                  
               </p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_005">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_005">*</ref>"Nor deemed that it was true which was spoken by the angel, but thought I
                     saw a vision."</p>
               </note>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6581-00000039"/>
               <p>"We are both guided by angels and archangels whom we cannot see, my lord." This
                  was the young man's reverent reply.</p>
               <p>The heavy door of the Archbishop's private laboratory swung open. The Canon
                  himself, who had unlocked it, had never entered the chamber before. And the man of
                  science was himself surprised, when he saw how extensive was the apparatus of
                  mystery and of alchemy which was collected there. He recognized one and another
                  implement of infant chemistry, which he had himself used in his master's workshop,
                  and which the Archbishop had rescued from destruction when his master fled. He saw
                  also in an instant that, as he had supposed, the stores of the Jew Cimchi had
                  found their way to this collection. The place itself, with its collection of
                  unknown machines, had a little of the look of that curiosity-shop, represented by
                  Albert Durer, some centuries later, in which his weird Melancolia sits brooding.
                  In the Archbishop's den, however, neither prelate nor physician had time to lose.
                  The young man cast his eye around, and, seeing an exquisite cabinet of Venetian
                  inlaid work on one side, asked his companion if there were no Venetian keys upon
                  the chain which he had brought with him. A few experiments threw open the little
                  case, and a series of choice phials—some of silver, some of glass—stood before
                  them both, which the younger of the two visitors recognized at once as being of
                  the most careful Saracen workmanship of the time.</p>
               <p>He brought his tall candle to the little shelves, and read the names marked upon
                  the several elixirs, tinctures, spirits, and "humors." To his eye, some of the
                  flasks before him were worth a king's ransom. But at this moment they had not
                  kings to ransom, but Félicie to save. And, in an instant, he showed to the prelate
                  what they wanted. Marked first in Arabic, and beneath in Latin, was the "Elixir of
                  Cordova, of the second formula of Abulcasis."</p>
               <p>"Your reverence sees that here is what we need. Am I to take the flask to the
                  child?"</p>
               <p>The prelate bent, and read the second inscription. "It is in his grace's own
                  handwriting," he said. "How strange that these Saracens whom we are riding down in
                  the field are those who send to us the elixirs of life in our homes. Let it be as
                  the Lord wills. If my Lord did not deem the elixir precious, he would not have
                  saved it. But it is written that the paynim also shall serve. 'Ask of me, and I
                  will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.' Take what is needed, my son,
                  'For the Love of Christ,' and may the Holy Mother give the blessing which is
                  promised to those who serve 'IN HIS NAME.'"</p>
               <p>Unconsciously the father had twice used the first and last passwords of the
                  initiated Poor Men of Lyons. The proficient started as he did before, when he
                  heard the two phrases together, and felt, indeed, that the true minister before
                  him had used them wisely and well. The permission once given him, he took the
                  precious flask from its companions. The prelate locked the cabinet, locked the
                  door of the cell, and then offered to go with the other to the child's bedside. "I
                  will administer extreme unction, if you think her case so desperate."</p>
               <p>"My father, the child is unconscious. But, at the least, her breath will not pass
                  away for hours. You can be ill spared from yonder service. If, when it is over,
                  she needs your care, you shall find me waiting at the door of the chapel."</p>
               <p>And so they parted: the Florentine with the priest's blessing, the prelate with
                  the other's thanks. With his great candle flaring, he crossed the street in the
                  darkness, passed rapidly up to the great cathedral door, and bade the throng open,
                  that he might enter. At the sight of the great chief of the whole solemnity in his
                  full robes of ceremony, the crowd in street and porch rolled back reverently, and
                  the holy man, still wondering at all which had passed, walked up the nave, where
                  all made room for him, bearing his flambeau still, and as if he were in a dream.
                  To the multitude, this seemed a part of the ceremonial. To the canons and the
                  other clergy, it was all amazing. He came to the altar as his humble substitute
                  was chanting the words,—</p>
               <p>"The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see the salvation of
                  our God."</p>
               <p>And never had those words seemed to Father William to mean so much as they meant
                  now. He knelt at Father Alexander's side. He gave to him the candle which he bore,
                  still burning, and assumed again his part in the Sacred office.</p>
               <p>And so the service of triumph went on, the Communion and the Post-Communion. And,
                  at the close, Father William offered the prayer:—</p>
               <p>"Grant us, O Lord, we pray, that we may live in the new life of thine only
                  begotten son, in whose heavenly mystery we eat and drink this night. Through that
                  same Lord, we offer our petitions."</p>
               <p>And it seemed to Father William that never had he known, as now, what that New
                  Life was. And as, upon his knees, he thought how a Gospel of Love was lifting
                  Félicie from the dead that night, and who should say how many more of the sick and
                  suffering, the priest felt as he had never felt before, on the Vigil of the
                  Nativity, that "the Lord had visited his people."</p>

               <head type="sub">CHRISTMAS DAWNS.</head>
               <p>THE blackamoor was waiting at the outer doorway for the Florentine's return: The
                  master, he said, was in Madame Waldo's kitchen, and thither the young man carried
                  to him the precious Elixir.</p>
               <p>"Thank God that you are here!" said his master who, with his outer garments off,
                  was at work as a cook might be, over the coals. "And thank God again, that you
                  have this that you are sent for." He held the dark-red elixir to the light, and
                  smiled graciously and sweetly again, as he saw its perfect clearness and the
                  richness of its color. "Dear child, these sour watery wines would not lie upon her
                  stomach. You were right in using them so sparingly. I left her just now, after
                  another of these spasms you described to me. I do not know but I myself brought it
                  on. Yet I could not have seen her die before my eyes, in lipothymy, for want of
                  stimulant and reaction. Now we can quicken the beating of her heart, without
                  flooding her stomach with sour grape juice.</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6581-00000040"/>
               <p>"My faith began to fail me. I knew she was lost if they had seized you," he
                  continued, as they mounted the stair. "I was at work with the dame's pipkins and
                  pans trying to make a little spirit pass over upon the bit of earthenware you saw
                  me holding. But it was a poor alembic I had made, compared to that in which this
                  spirit was distilled."</p>
               <p>And so they entered the child's room once more.</p>
               <p>The Florentine was amazed, himself, to see how much she seemed to have withered
                  away, since he was gone. He had been in that chamber twenty-seven hours
                  continuously, before he left it. From minute to minute he had watched her face,
                  and so gradual had been the decline which that time had wrought in it, that, from
                  the very watchfulness of his care, he did not enough appreciate it. But the hour
                  of his absence had changed her terribly. And because he had been absent, he now
                  noted every detail of the change.</p>
               <p>Ready for his use, John of Lugio had three or four silver spoons lying heated on
                  the hearth, close to the embers. With a gloved hand he took one of these, dropped
                  into it what he thought enough of his precious Christ-sent elixir, partially
                  cooled it, for an instant, on the surface of a full cup of water, and then poured
                  the spirit with a firm hand between the close lips of the child, who never seemed
                  to struggle when he dealt with her. Jean Waldo, from the other side of the bed,
                  and Madame Gabrielle, from the foot of it, sadly watched the whole.</p>
               <p>The adept placed his hand upon the heart of his patient, counting the pulsations
                  with his eyes closed, and then, crossing the room, set Giulio's pendulum again in
                  motion. There stole over the girl's face an expression which all of them construed
                  as that of relief from pain. No one of all those watching her said a single word,
                  as a space of time which might have been five minutes went by. But in that time
                  the dear child twice turned her head on the pillow, as if she would say, "I can
                  sleep now," and her whole expression certainly came to indicate the absence of
                  pain. The Florentine once and again renewed the motion of the pendulum; and his
                  master, again by the bedside, as often noted the pulsation of the sufferer's
                  heart, and counted the heaving of her lungs.</p>
               <p>He said nothing. None of them now said anything. But at the end, perhaps of ten
                  minutes, not dissatisfied, as it would seem, with the experiment, he heated again
                  a few drops of the elixir, and again poured them into her mouth, which opened now
                  without any of the spasmodic struggle which had, sometimes, checked their efforts
                  for her. The master put his hand upon her forehead, smiled with that tender smile
                  which they had now all come to look for and hope for, and then whispered to her
                  mother, "Now for your hot cloths at her stomach and hot water for her feet again.
                  If she sleeps she shall do well. 'Si dormit salva erit,' he said to Giulio again;
                  "there is better authority for that than for any of Pope Sylvester's maxims."</p>
               <p>And then, rather in following his example than in obedience to any formal
                  directions, they all seated themselves,—the two physicians by the fire, the father
                  and mother by the sides of the bed, the one attendant in the corner, and no one
                  spoke a word. The last thing had been done that their skill or energy could
                  command. Every one of the group had done, in his best way, what he could in
                  bringing it about, and every one of them knew that now life or death was, in no
                  sense, in their hands. In his own fashion, probably, each of them prayed: even the
                  poor silent blackamoor, to such God as he knew; the mother, to the virgin and St.
                  Félicie and St. Gabrielle; the father, with a wretched consciousness that he had
                  hitherto conceived that his wife and daughter could do all the praying needful in
                  that house, or that he could pay for what more might be needed; the Florentine as
                  to the Spirit of Life, that that living spirit would so purify and quicken the
                  child's spirit, that flesh and blood, drug and poison, might obey its requisition
                  and command; and the priest, because the wisest of them all, with the very
                  simplest prayer of all, "Father of all of us, come to us all."</p>
               <p>There was no method of noting the passage of time, unless they had counted the
                  beatings of their own hearts, now that the pendulum of the Florentine had been
                  left unmoved. But, after a longer space than any, in which either the girl's
                  stillness or their own anxiety had permitted them to sit silent before, the master
                  crossed to the bed again, felt of her head and of her heart again, and then, with
                  his pleased smile, nodded to his assistant, and, in a whisper, bade him bring a
                  larger draught than they had given of the cordial. He only nodded and smiled, as
                  he caught the anxious and eager, questioning look of Madame Gabrielle. But those
                  signals were enough,—and she, poor soul, was on her knees at the bedside, in the
                  most voluble prayer, though wholly silent.</p>
               <p>The master indulged her for a few moments in these grateful devotions, then walked
                  round and touched her on the shoulder, and made her supremely happy by summoning
                  her to duty. It was simply that she should place a fresh pillow on the bed, and
                  then, with her stoutest maid, should lift the child from the one side of it to the
                  other, that she might have the best chance for the sleep which seemed now to be
                  nature's best restorative. These cares ended, he banished Madame Gabrielle
                  absolutely from the room, and her husband as well. He bade the maid prepare a bed
                  for the Florentine, as if he were her master, and sent them both away. He told the
                  blackamoor to renew the heap of wood by the fire, and then to wait in the corridor
                  till he was called. He extinguished all the candles which they had been using in
                  their several cares, so that he could remove from the girl's bedside the screens
                  which had kept the light from her eyes. And then, as the only watchman by the
                  flickering fire of her earthly being, he threw himself into one of the deep
                  arm-chairs which Madame Gabrielle had provided, and, in the absolute stillness of
                  the night, waited the issue of their efforts and their prayers.</p>
               <p>As he looked into the waning embers of the fire, and saw, once and again, a spark
                  running in its wayward course, up and down and everywhere on the back of the
                  chimney, telling what the children called prophetic tales to the looker-on,—as he
                  looked back, were it only on the events of that day, since he was interrupted by
                  the charcoal-dealer, as he compared the various readings in St. Jerome's
                  Evangelistaries, but just before noon, it was as if in to-day's experience his
                  whole life took order before him. The master was not much in the habit of raking
                  over the embers of his past life, but it was almost impossible not to look into
                  them in the midst of the reminiscences of such a day as this.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6581-00000041"/>
               <p>Of the two Benedictines whom he had met so unexpectedly by the postern gate of the
                  abbey at Cornillon, one was the companion even of his childish life, the son of
                  his father's nearest neighbor. The master's memory did not go back to a time
                  before that, when, with a little boy of just his own strength and size, he dug in
                  the sand-heaps by the road-side, or made ineffectual traps for the sparrows. With
                  that boy he had grown,—had worked in the simple farm-life of the fields around
                  Lugio,—had, when they were older, learned his letters, and learned to write at
                  last. The parish priest had taken a fancy to both these boys, who discouraged the
                  noisy and mischievous urchins of the town, as they all sat together in the church,
                  and wondered when the mass would be over. As the little fellows grew bigger, the
                  worthy man selected these two to be robed in little robes, and to carry, in the
                  service, bell and book and incense. He loved nothing better than to walk with them
                  and talk with them, now of saints and their battles and victories, now of birds
                  and snakes and frogs, or of flowers and fruits, as they found them in the fields
                  and woods and marshes. And, by this selection of his, and by their own natural
                  bent, it had happened that, when the other boys around them became masons, or
                  vineyard dressers, or sometimes carriers and merchants' men; when some of them
                  went into the service of one or another of the neighboring gentry, and so showed
                  themselves, on the first holidays, in new jerkins or hauberks, to the wonder of
                  the boys less smartly dressed, Jean and François had too much to do in the service
                  of the church, or in studying with the priest, or in one or another message of
                  his, sometimes taking them as far as the Cathedral, and into high intimacy with
                  archdeacons and canons; had too much of this dignified and grateful service for
                  them to think or care for the more carnal lines of life in which their companions
                  were engaging. François, his companion, under the ecclesiastical name of Stephen,
                  was the older of the Benedictines he had met that day. It was in one of those
                  early journeys, when he was yet hardly more than a boy, that he had gone on some
                  errand to the great Monastery of Clairvaux, a place not unfamiliar to him, and had
                  been actually there, awaiting the answer to a message, when the great Bernard
                  died,—the man to whom all Europe deferred more, as it owed more, than to any
                  other. And as the master looked back, he knew that it was the lesson of that hour,
                  sad and solemn, which had determined him, then and there to give up his life to
                  the service and help of other men. Then came on years of life,—impatient enough at
                  the time, very likely, but, as he looked back upon them, sunny indeed, and crowded
                  with incident and enjoyment. The sailing down the river with his lively
                  companions, of which the Baroness of Montferrand had reminded him, was a fair
                  enough illustration of that life. And there was a wrench at his heart now,
                  renewing many and many a march of many a night of struggle at that time, as he
                  asked himself now, for the thousandth time, <emph>if</emph>—?</p>
               <p>"If he had then and there given up his determination to make himself a priest, if
                  he had then and there asked his mother's goddaughter, Anne of Thoissey,—so brave
                  and true and loyal as she was, and so beautiful withal,—to share life with him;
                  and If—</p>
               <p>"If she had said, what it sometimes times seemed that she might say; and they two
                  together had given themselves to the service of God and ministry to man, might it
                  have been that they could have rendered wider service, and made their own lives
                  and other lives more godly, than had happened as it was?" He had torn himself from
                  her, and with so many of these men, with whom today was mixing him again, had
                  entered on his priestly training. And she,—at this moment she was abbess in the
                  Convent of Montmerle. Was she happier and better—and was he?</p>
               <p>Then there was all his earlier training of manhood, and the taking of his vows.
                  And the memories of all those young men who then surrounded him: they were now
                  canons and deacons and bishops and archbishops; they were with Philip and Richard
                  in the East; they were the heads of houses here in the West; yes,—and so many of
                  them were in heaven! How strangely had every one of them falsified every
                  prediction which, in those days of their novitiate, they would have been sure to
                  make regarding each other!</p>
               <p>And so he came down to the period of a man's activity, to what one of our poets
                  calls "the joy of eventful living." Those happy days here in Lyons, when he never
                  looked back, and scarcely ever looked forward; when he found, at his right hand
                  and at his left hand, noble men and noble women from every grade in life, only
                  eager to serve God as God should show them how. The practical enthusiasm of Peter
                  of Waldo! The discovery of new truth and higher Life which each day made, as they
                  studied gospel and epistle! The strength they all gained in sympathy: sometimes
                  from the droll beggars who came to them in travel; sometimes from women and
                  children who seemed inspired in the very proportion of their ignorance of books;
                  waifs and strays these, who came to light, as the "Poor Men of Lyons" assembled
                  the troops from highways and byways, from hedges and ditches, at their houses of
                  bread and houses of God! In the midst of this, as if it were almost another man
                  whose life he was recalling, came the memories of all those studies in physical
                  science, the fruits of which he was this night using; his journeys to Cordova and
                  Seville; his interviews with the Cimchis and Abulcasis; the enthusiasm which even
                  Guichard, now Archbishop, showed, as in the cell of Abulcasis he and Jean of Lugio
                  together saw for the first time what seemed almost the miracle of distillation,
                  and their first success in repeating that experiment with the humble apparatus
                  which they two had made for themselves! And to think of what had passed since
                  then! Guichard, an archbishop, Lord of the fief of Lyons, and John of Lugio, an
                  exile, with a sword hanging over his head!</p>
               <p>And so his memories ran down through all the days of trial. First, there was the
                  happy work over Scripture with Peter Waldo, with Bernard of Ydros, and with
                  Stephen of Empsa. Then, the journey to Rome with Peter Waldo, and the welcome by
                  Pope Alexander, more than cordial—the welcome which gave such wings and such
                  courage to their return. Then, John of Balmeis's scorn, as he received the Pope's
                  letter, his pretended inquiry, and his bitter and cruel excommunication. Then, the
                  wretched years of suspense, more wretched than those of certainty in exile;
                  Peter's second visit to Rome; the council called by Lucius, and its<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC6581-00000042"/> jealousies; the clergy against the laymen, and the
                  laymen scorned and rejected. "Ah me," said John of Lugio, aloud, "it is always as
                  it was in the beginning. The carpenter's shop could gain no welcome in the temple
                  courts, and it cannot to-day. He was despised and rejected of men."</p>
               <p>Had he disturbed his patient by speaking?</p>
               <p>She turned on her pillow, and said, "Mamma! Mamma!"</p>
               <p>John of Lugio gently crossed the room, removing the candle from its shelter as he
                  did so, that she might see him distinctly, and then he said, as if he had known
                  her all her life, and was her dear friend, "Your mamma is asleep now, dear child,
                  and she has left me to take care of you. She left this bunch of grapes for you to
                  wet your lips with."</p>
               <p>"Bunch of grapes—wet my lips," said the girl, almost laughing at the oddity which
                  supposed that she, of all people, needed nursing in the middle of the night; and
                  then she tried to rise upon her elbow, and then found she had not just the balance
                  that she needed, and dropped back upon her pillow. "Where am I? What is it?" she
                  asked, more doubtfully.</p>
               <p>"You have been very ill, my dear child, but you are better now; wet your lips with
                  the grapes; that will please mamma; or let me give you a little of the broth which
                  she left for you."</p>
               <p>"Broth which she left for me? Did not I drink some—herb drink which she made for
                  me? or—or—is that—all that—a horrid dream? O, sir, I have had such dreams." And
                  she sank quite exhausted on the pillow.</p>
               <p>"Dear Félicie, you shall forget them all. Take mamma's broth, and take with it a
                  little of this cordial, and try to sleep again." There was little need for
                  persuasion. The child lay almost impassive as he fed her; thanked him then with
                  the same prettiness and sweetness with which she spoke to beggar or worshipper on
                  the hill or in the church of St. Thomas, and, in a moment, was asleep again. But
                  sleep now was so beautiful and so regular, her pale face had lost so entirely the
                  lines of agony and struggle, that the priest, as he looked on, thanked God in his
                  heart of hearts for the greatest of blessings, the return of health, and for the
                  sight most beautiful of all His gifts,—the sight of a sleeping child.</p>
               <p>As he returned to his watch by the fire, the silence of night was broken by the
                  chimes of the cathedral. In an instant more he heard the rival chimes of the Abbey
                  of He Barbe, and then the chimes of Ainay, and then the ringing of bells that
                  could not be named, as Sts. Machabees and St. Nizier and St. Paul, and the tower
                  of the Augustins, and every church and abbey and convent in all the country around
                  broke out with joy to announce that the Lord of Life was born into the world.</p>
               <p>"Unto us a child is born," said John of Lugio, reverently.</p>
               <p>Hour after hour his quiet watch went by. Wise as he was, he did not dream that
                  only on the other side of the doorway, crouching on a mattress, through all these
                  hours, was Madame Gabrielle, waiting for sound or signal which might give her
                  permission to return to her post at her child's side. No! The house was so still,
                  that the wise man thought that all had obeyed his orders, and that all were
                  sleeping. From hour to hour he took such occasion as the child's occasional
                  restlessness gave him, to feed her with her mother's broth, and to give the
                  precious stimulant of the Archbishop's elixir. And she, dear girl, fairly smiled
                  in her sleep, once and again, as happier dreams came over her, and as Nature
                  asserted herself now, that the poison was so nearly gone from her. At last, as the
                  priest supposed, this night had nearly sped. He drew the curtain, and he was
                  right; there was a gray light spread over the east, in the midst of which the
                  morning-star shone with beauty preternatural, with a light so bright that he could
                  see it reflected in the river below. The light was so gentle that he thought it
                  would not disturb the child. He crossed to the door to bid the black call Madame
                  Gabrielle. And lo, she was already there! He led her to the bedside, that he might
                  show to her the glow of new life upon Félicie's face. And just as they approached,
                  the child opened her eyes again, and looked wistfully around, and even sat up and
                  began to speak. "Mamma, mamma."</p>
               <p>And he delivered her to her mother.</p>
               <p>With that gift of Life new born, the Christmas Day of that home began.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">TWELFTH NIGHT.</head>
               <p>WHEN Twelfth Night came, the great hall of Jean Waldo's workshop had been cleared
                  from all its looms.</p>
               <p>In their places were three long tables, which stretched from end to end of the
                  long room, and across the top a fourth table, which united these together.</p>
               <p>All through the day the great kitchen was crowded by the eager servants of the
                  household, and all the neighbors' kitchens were put into requisition as well, to
                  furnish forth the most noble feast which had been seen in Lyons for many, many
                  years. Men even whispered that the great feast, when the Archbishop entertained
                  King Richard and King Philip, was not so grand.</p>
               <p>That morning Félicie, and her mother and father, and her cousin Gabrielle
                  L'Estrange, and many others of the family,—"too many for to name,"—had all gone
                  together in a little pilgrimage of thanksgiving to the cathedral. Félicie had
                  begged that they would take her to her own little eyrie church of St. Thomas, on
                  the top of the hill; but no, that was quite too far, even though Félicie rode in
                  the chariot which appeared in public so seldom. At the cathedral, also, they could
                  be present while the good Father William said mass, and their solemnity would
                  hardly be complete without him.</p>
               <p>After this offering, they had all returned together to the house, and there the
                  grand salon was opened, the room which seemed to Félicie almost mysterious, so
                  seldom did it see the light of day. And when it did, she found that it was like
                  most other mysteries, for there was very little in it. But to-day, dear old Eudes,
                  who had been a sort of major-domo, or servant-master, in Madame Waldo's household,
                  even before Félicie was born, had done his best to make it seem cheerful. At each
                  end a lordly fire, made of great oak logs, blazed cheerfully. Eudes had sent the
                     lads<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6581-00000043"/> everywhere to bring laurel and
                  other evergreens to hang above the chimney-pieces and between the windows and
                  around the sconces; and after they had come home from mass, when one and another
                  of the guests began to appear, whom Jean Waldo had summoned from far and near,—as
                  they gathered, at first a little shyly, around one fireplace or another, but soon
                  unbending before the genuine hospitality of all who were at home, and as people
                  will unbend, in France of all nations, when old and young meet in the same
                  company,—the great hall was then cheerful indeed. The talk was loud and the
                  merriment contagious. Dear little Félicie sat in a great arm-chair, with her feet
                  lifted upon a footstool, but she did not look as if this care were in the least
                  needful. Only her mother and her father seemed to feel that unless they were
                  taking care of her, in some visible fashion, at every moment, all might escape
                  again, and be gone. But Félicie had her aids, to fetch and carry for her, and to
                  run hither and thither with her messages. She said she meant to play at being
                  queen upon her throne; and, indeed, she was so, pretty creature, in the midst of
                  all that assembly. Gabrielle L'Estrange took great airs as being a lady in
                  waiting, and came and whispered, and ran hither and thither, as if her sovereign's
                  commands were most difficult of execution. And for the first hour, that shy,
                  pretty Fanchon, the daughter of Mark of Seyssel, stood almost constantly at the
                  side of Félicie's chair. She was dressed in a holiday costume, such as the
                  peasants of the hills were fond of wearing, so simple and pretty and quaint that
                  she attracted everybody's notice in the midst of the Lyonnaise girls, in their
                  more uniform costume. Fanchon felt at ease with Félicie from the very first kiss.
                  It took her longer to adjust herself to Gabrielle's busy, active, diplomatic
                  managing of the party. But Fanchon, also, melted at last to the simple courtesies
                  and hospitalities of the place. And, as the afternoon began to come in, and the
                  winter sun crept in a little at the western windows, Félicie had the joy to see
                  all her guests—for her father said that this was her party, and only hers—obeying
                  the sound of pipe and tabor and harp, and dancing merrily, from one end of the
                  hall to the other. Always there was a little court clustered around her throne.
                  But always she would order them away, in such couples as it pleased her Majesty to
                  select, and send them out again "to try the adventure" of the dance, she said. "To
                  try" this or that "adventure" was the standard phrase of the romances of the
                  troubadours, with which Félicie and her young friends, and, indeed, all the
                  company, were wholly familiar.</p>
               <p>And, before the early winter sun went down, others joined in the festival, so that
                  when Eudes came bustling in, to tell Madame Waldo that all was ready at the
                  tables, Father John of Lugio was one of her guests again. And she brought him to
                  her daughter, and, in that sweet, courteous way of his, he told her Majesty that
                  he was bidden to take her to the supper-room, and asked her to lead with him the
                  procession. And then, even to Félicie's amazement, and almost to her terror,
                  Father william appeared also, whom she had not seen before, and Father William
                  followed close on Father John, giving his hand to Félicie's mother. And then the
                  order required that Giulio the Florentine should lead in Madame L'Estrange, who
                  wondered indeed herself at finding herself so provided for, and then the other
                  guests followed, in many a combination quite as strange. In a few minutes all were
                  ordered: Félicie at her mother's side, and on their right and left the two
                  priests; the Florentine and Madame L'Estrange; the Baron of Montferrand and the
                  Lady Alix. Even the two monks. Stephen and Hugh, had obtained some sort of
                  dispensation from their convent, and were here; Gualtier of the Mill was here;
                  Mark of Seyssel and his wife and all his children, down to Hubert, were here; poor
                  Prinhac was here, with his arm in a sling; the officer of the night, who threw up
                  the portcullis so promptly, was here, and the sentinel who held the gate. Here was
                  the farmer of the hill-side. Here was every groom that had cared for the horses
                  who that day sped so well; here was the boy who rode Cœur-Blanc into the stable,
                  when Father Jean was afraid to be seen; here was Father Alexander, who crossed the
                  blazing chancel so fearlessly with the Florentine. Here was every messenger who
                  had been sent on that sad night for Félicie's father and for the doctor; every
                  neighbor who had brought in oil, or snow, or herbs, for her relief; every maid who
                  had warmed a plate or filled a jug of hot water for her. More than seven score
                  guests were assembled, of every degree,—gentlemen and grooms, ladies and
                  scullion-maids. The invitations had been given with diligent care to every one who
                  had done anything, in that night of trial, which had helped our darling Félicie,
                  and to every one who had tried to do so.</p>
               <p>Father William asked God's blessing on the feast; and, with great merriment and
                  joy, it went forward. The young men and the girls had every sort of joke about the
                  Twelfth-Night presents, which they had secretly brought for each other; and, at
                  the last, there was great ceremony and rivalry as to who should have the sacred
                  bean, which was baked in the Twelfth cake, which Félicie pretended to cut, and
                  which was, in truth, cut by the strong right arm of John of Lugio. No; there was
                  no manner of cheating or forcing, and the bean fell to the pretty Fanchon,—Mark's
                  daughter,—who blushed almost as red as her own bright ribbons when Philip
                  L'Estrange brought to her the bean on a silver plate, and made to her a low bow
                  and a flourishing speech, in which he said that her Majesty Queen Félicie sent it
                  with her royal regards to her Majesty Queen Fanchon. The feasting went on, and the
                  fun went on, and on one seemed to enjoy the feasting or the fun more than Jean
                  Waldo himself, though he sat at neither table, but passed about from guest to
                  guest, with a napkin on his arm, as one of the servants, bringing here a plate and
                  there a cup, and urging all to eat and drink, and only happy, and were provided
                  for.</p>
               <p>And, when the feasting seemed to be nearly ended, not because the bountiful stores
                  provided had failed, but because there is an end even to a Twelfth-Night appetite,
                  Jean Waldo came round, and stood by John of Lugio, and whispered to him, and then
                  the Father rose, and asked for silence, which awaited him of course. And he said,
                  nearly what I have said, that this was Félicie's feast, and that her father had
                  given it for her, as his simplest way of showing honor to all who had prayed for
                  her and toiled for her on the terrible night when her life was in danger. "He
                  wants to thank you all, and to promise you his best prayers for your welfare in
                     all<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6581-00000044"/> your lives. He is afraid he cannot
                  say what he would fain say," said the master, "and so he bids me say it for him to
                  you all." And there was great clapping of hands from all the great at all the
                  tables, and they all cried "He is welcome, he is welcome," and some cried, "Long
                  life to the lady Félicie." And poor Félicie was crying, as if her heart was
                  breaking, though her face seemed so happy all the while. And her mother held her
                  hand, and cried as if her heart was breaking, though her face seemed so happy all
                  the while. And her mother held her hand, and cried as if her heart was breaking
                  too.</p>
               <p>And then Jean Waldo waved his hand, and said, "I do not know how to speak as these
                  Fathers do. But I must try. I must thank you all, all of you, with all my heart,
                  that my darling is here, and that we are all so happy. Ah, my friends," he said,
                  "You know me for a hard man, who has said to you a thousand times, that I would
                  take care of my affairs, if other people would take care of theirs. O, my God, I
                  have said it again and again,—I know not how often I have said it to those who are
                  in this company. But I learned everything, I think, on the eve of Noël. In those
                  terrible nights I learned that I wanted others—O, how many others—to take care of
                  me and of my dearest concerns, yes, though they risked their lives for it, as my
                  friend here did so bravely. And as those slow hours went by, I prayed to my God,
                  and I promised him, that whether my darling lived or died,—whether she lived with
                  me here, or with his angels there,—for me, I would live from that day forward for
                  all my brothers, and all my sisters, for you, and for you, and for you; yes, for
                  all his children, if I could help them. But, dear friends, I could not begin to do
                  this, without asking him to forgive me, and you to forgive me, that so often I
                  have said I would care for myself, if the others for themselves would care. I
                  could not begin to live for the rest, without asking the rest to pardon me that I
                  had lived for myself before. And so, at little Félicie's feast, I ask her, and I
                  ask you, as I ask the good God, to show me how to take care for others, and to
                  show others how to take care of me."</p>
               <p>Some of the guests were weeping, and some of them were clapping their hands, and
                  some of them were shouting "Long life to our Host, long life to Master Jean." But
                  Father William, who was standing with the tears running down his cheeks, waved his
                  hand; and they were all so amazed that he who acted as Archbishop should be here
                  at all, most of all that he should sit and stand so near to John of Lugio, that
                  they all stopped their shouting, that they might listen. And he smiled drolly, and
                  as if he had a secret, upon them all, till he saw that all were very curious; and
                  then, with his finger, he drew in the air the sign of the Cross of Malta; and then
                  he said, "I will teach our brother how to forget himself, and how to live for
                  others. What he does, let him do 'For the Love of Christ,' and whom he welcomes,
                  let him welcome 'IN HIS NAME.'" And then, passing behind Madame Waldo and little
                  Félicie, he threw his own arm about John of Lugio's neck, turned him, all
                  surprised as he was, so that he was face to face with him, and kissed him.</p>
               <p>O, the cheering and clapping, the tears and the surprise! To those who were
                  initiated, the wonder was how the reigning prince of Lyons had come upon their
                  secret. To those whose eyes were only partly opened to what Jean Waldo had seen so
                  clearly in those visions of his terrible night-watches, it was as if Saladin and
                  Philip had kissed each other on the Mount of Olives. To those initiates, who were
                  as bigoted in their way as was Montferrand, it was all amazement, that an
                  Archbishop of Lyons, or any one who sat in an Archbishop's throne, should have any
                  heart, or should speak aught but evil. To the churchmen, as to Alexander and Hugh
                  and Stephen, it was relief unspeakable. For here was their chief, doing more than
                  they had done to express sympathy and love which they were yearning to offer to
                  all.</p>
               <p>Jean of Lugio himself did not seem surprised. With an eager embrace he returned
                  the embrace,—with a second kiss upon William's cheek, he returned the kiss. "Ah!"
                  said he, "the Kingdom of God has truly come. The City of God is rescued, and we
                  are in it now. Heaven can offer us nothing sweeter than we have here. You will
                  never misunderstand us, William; we, shall never misunderstand you. What you ask
                  of us we shall perform; for you will ask 'For the Love of Christ,' and we shall
                  answer 'IN HIS NAME.'"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE WHOLE STORY.</head>
               <p>My uncle Adrian had brought us home this story, which you have been reading, from
                  the city of Lyons. He had walked over every inch of the ground that Félicie had
                  tripped over, that Giulio and Jean Waldo had hurried over, that the Canon William
                  had passed over as he bore his weird candle through the darkness; he had crossed
                  the short bridge and the long bridge; he had seen the site of Jean Waldo's
                  workshops; had climbed to the church of St. Thomas, which is now "Our Lady of
                  Fourvières"; he had crossed himself there, and had seen there the fresh votive
                  offerings, which young soldiers have hung there, whom our Lady saved from wounds
                  in the Prussian war. My uncle had looked across the valley of the Rhone, to see
                  the distant Mont Blanc near thirty leagues away.</p>
               <p>He had been through those Dauphin Mountains, and the scarped hills to the north of
                  them; down the valley of the Brevon and the Alberine, and along the Rhone,
                  crossing it back and forth, twice, just as Father John of Lugio did. He would not
                  say that he had found the charcoal hut of Mark of Seyssel, but he would say that
                  he had been on the place where it might very well have been.</p>
               <p>Then he had spent a happy day, how happy, in that quiet but cheerful old library
                  at Lyons, where nobody cared about Peter Waldo, but where all were as ready to
                  serve my uncle as if he had been Henry Fifth himself. He is about the age of the
                  Fifth Henry. And here he studied Claude Francis Menestrier's ponderous civil or
                  consular history of Lyons, while the full-length portrait of the benevolent Claude
                  Francis Menestrier smiled on him from the wall above. He studied Montfalcon's
                  Monuments of Lyons, magnificent in its apparel and precision. And was it, perhaps,
                  M. Montfalcon himself, who showed such<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6581-00000045"/>
                  courtesy to my uncle, though his French was so bad, and he a stranger without
                  introduction? Then he studied pamphlet upon pamphlet of indignant men who had to
                  reply to M. Montfalcon for this and for that, for which this reader need not care,
                  so that my uncle well understood that the flame which Peter Waldo and John of
                  Lugio, and the other Poor Men of Lyons, lighted, was not a flame which burned out
                  in one century, nor in two, nor in five. Nay, when my uncle went into the street,
                  and found that the City Council were trying to lock out the Government Prefect
                  from their own old town hall, he thought the old flame seemed to be burning
                  still.</p>
               <p>And many a map of brook and river and mountain had my uncle brought home,—and many
                  a sketch and photograph which we have not shown to you. He had many a story of
                  those who befriended John of Lugio and Peter Waldo, in their time. And long
                  stories he had to tell us of this hidden valley, and that defended cave, in which
                  one or another of the Poor Men of Lyons, or of those Waldenses, who, for centuries
                  after, defended the same faith, had hidden; but these things had nothing to do
                  with our little Félicie's Christmas and Twelfth Night, so that, as my uncle writes
                  out her story for you, they are not written down.</p>
               <p>It was on two warm September evenings, as we were all at the New Sybaris, by the
                  sea shore,—two of those evenings when we can have every window open, but when, so
                  early is the sunset, there are two or three hours after tea before it is
                  bedtime,—it was on two such evenings that my uncle read to us the story of
                  Félicie, of Jean Waldo, of Giulio the Florentine, of the ride to the hills, and
                  the charcoal-burner's hut, of John of Lugio, and of Christmas eve, as poor Félicie
                  spent it, and as the Canon William spent it; and then of Christmas morning, and of
                  Félicie's Twelfth-Night Feast,—the story which you have just now read, dear
                  reader, to which you and I give the title, "IN HIS NAME."</p>
               <p>My boy philip had been permitted to sit up later than usual, to hear the end of
                  the Twelfth-Night Feast. When it was finished, his mother bade him take his
                  candle, but he lingered a moment to ask his uncle the inevitable question, "Is it
                  true, Uncle Adrian?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know why not," said my uncle. "Peter of Waldo was driven out, just thus
                  and so, and John of Lugio with him,—two men of whom the world was not worthy.
                  Richard and Philip went to the Crusade just there and then, and broke down the
                  bridge as the story tells you. Averroes and Abulcasis, and a dozen others like
                  them, had, just then, set every man of sense in Europe on the studies which turned
                  the old quackeries of medicine upside down. And the 'Poor Men of Lyons,' and their
                  associates in the mountains, had to protect themselves with all their wits, I can
                  tell you, and with more passwords than the story tells you of, as they went back
                  and forth from city to mountain. Which Canon William took the dean's place when he
                  was away, the story does not tell, and I do not know, but it was some Canon
                  William. Whether Cœur-Blanc's feet were white or black, the story does not tell,
                  and I do not know; nor whether Mark's daughter Fanchon were fifteen or sixteen.
                  But this is true, I am sure, that none of them in the end failed who did anything
                  'for the Love of Christ,' if they could find anybody to join them 'in His
                  Name.'"</p>
               <p>"My dear Philip," said his Aunt Priscilla, "there has been just the same story
                  going on in this last week, here under your nose, only you have been too busy with
                  your boat and your gun to see it or hear it."</p>
               <p>"Going on here, dear aunt?"</p>
               <p>"It is always going on, Philip. Jesus Christ is giving life more abundantly, and
                  awakening the dead now, just as he said he would. When Dr. Sargent gets up at
                  midnight, and rides behind the old gray twenty miles before morning, to poor old
                  Mrs. Fetridge's bedside, do you suppose he does it because he thinks the town will
                  pay him half-a-dollar for going? He does it because Jesus Christ bade him do it,
                  though very likely he never says he does it 'for the love of Christ,' or 'In His
                  Name.' When Mr. Johnson sent down the mustard that I put on Mary's chest last
                  night, sharp mustard and fiery, instead of sending saw-dust, colored with
                  turmeric; do you suppose he did it to save your father's custom? He did it because
                  he would rather die than cheat any man out of the shadow of a penny. And that
                  comes from what your Father John would have called 'the love of Christ,' and
                  working 'in his name.' Or when the expressman came in afoot last night, with the
                  telegram from Kingston, when his team had broken down, because he was afraid it
                  was important, do you think he walked those five miles because anybody hired him?
                  He did not make any cross of Malta, and he did not speak any password at the door;
                  but, all the same, the good fellow did his message for 'the love of Christ,' and
                  never would have done it if he had not lived and moved, his life long, among
                  people who are confederated 'in his name.'</p>
               <p>"Five hundred years hence, dear Phil, they will publish a story about you and me.
                  We shall seem very romantic then; and we shall be worth reading about, if what we
                  do is simple enough, and brave enough, and loving enough, for anybody to think
                  that we do it 'for the love of Christ,' or for anybody to guess that we had been
                  bound together "IN HIS NAME."</p>

               conveyed, that every mother should present her children with it as a text-book on
               children's manners towards parents, servants, and companions. Tenderness, devotion,
               truth, repentance for faults inevitable while the old Adam remains an heirloom in the
               human family, sympathy with distress, generosity toward misfortune, and the
               superiority of the moral to the merely earthly, are happily taught by every little

                  sincerest pleasure by thousands of children, and in that pleasure there will not
                  be a single forbidden ingredient. 'My Boys,' which, opening upon by chance, we
                  read through at a sitting, is charming. Ladislas, the noble, sweet-tempered Pole,

            <p>"One rarely meets with three so thoroughly charming and satisfactory books for
               children as the 'Doll-World Series,' by Mrs. Robert O'Reilly. Their author seems to
               possess—and in a high degree—every one of the very peculiar and varied
               characteristics which fit one to be a good writer for the young. She is humorous,—one
               ought, perhaps, to say funny, for that is the word which the children understand
               best; and Mrs. O'Reilly's wit is not the sly satire which appeals in a kind of aside
               to the adults present, but the bubbling merriment which is addressed directly to the
               ready risibles of her proper audience."—<title>Boston Daily Advertiser.</title>

                  Price, $1.00. "This is a most exquisite little book. It consists of a number of
                  stories in which small children are the characters. The naturalness of the talk,
                  the actors, and the situations, is the most charming imaginable. The author has
                  certainly found the key that unlocks the gate leading into the very garden of
                  little people's thoughts and feelings. A vein of gentle satire on 'children of a
                  larger growth' enhances the piquancy of the stories. The illustrations are the
                  most perfect pictures of children and their arch ways that have come under our
