'6           3ONATHAN OLDI3UOK&#xD;
&#xD;
Mt Ol4buok was a man of about forty-nine years of age, btxt who&#xD;
'wished he was only thirty, and trie&amp;amp; all in his power to make him.&#xD;
-eelf appear so. He was not a good..loeking man by any means, his&#xD;
figure was about the riddle size, and as he was beginning to grow&#xD;
-stout, he buttoned his coat closely to make him look as thin as&#xD;
possible. He was not handsome, for his eyes were of a greyish hue,&#xD;
the balls rather bloodshot, and the eyelashes from age almost the&#xD;
-color of the 'eyes~ But 'Jonuithan Oldbnck wore spectacles, and he&#xD;
scarcely ever took them off, his nose was very flat, his chin rather&#xD;
rourfd, and his mouth large, but Mr. Oldbuck Would now and then&#xD;
put on a rather agreeable expression, for a smile would come to his&#xD;
aid, and when a man smiles, he always looks pleasant. In fine, ho&#xD;
was a man, who was very careful in his dress, an~ if ho had a little&#xD;
better head of hair, would have passed amongst the crowd, but he&#xD;
was bald on the summit, and as men generally look up to the fore~&#xD;
head, he carefully tried to conceal the defect, by bringing his hair&#xD;
from the back of' his head to the front and performing the same&#xD;
- operation with that above his ears. Withal, it could only be said,&#xD;
that he had a very prominent forehead, and it was questionable,&#xD;
whether he should have worn a wig or not. You will see from this,&#xD;
'that Mr Oldbuek was a man who had every desire to please; he&#xD;
possessed a very sensible heart, for he adored the fair sex, and love&#xD;
was the principal occupation of his life.&#xD;
There are' indeed very few persons, who have not experienced this&#xD;
feeling at some time or other, or who have not devoted a little of&#xD;
their ipisure to, dalliance with the ladies, for as Voltaire says#." we&#xD;
'must love, it is that which sustains u~, and without loving, sad&#xD;
'~wo~uld be' the fate of man."&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck had, however, from his youthful years, carried&#xD;
"the thins to an excess. ]~ven in his childhood, he had given proofs&#xD;
of much tend'erz~ess; he loved birds, petted cats, and cried eight days,&#xD;
~be~Oausa his ~favorite dog left, him. Then, when he reached the years&#xD;
of adles~e~ioe, he contracted a tender attachment for a fat Irish girl,&#xD;
'who pi~esid:ed over the kitchen in his father's establishment. Young&#xD;
"Oldbuck was always in 'the kitoheii; he learnt his lessons there, and&#xD;
4ried to toacl!~ Meggy the cook, the rudiments of Latin.&#xD;
Whilst Maggy was plucking a pigeon, or seasoning the spinage,&#xD;
Little Jonathan would look at her in the face, and say&#xD;
'~'4mo tib4 Maggy. Will you conjugate the verb emare, with&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
* "Let me alone, Master Jonathan, what do I know about Latin;&#xD;
speak in~ pure Inglisli, I tell ye, and don't bother me with what I&#xD;
~don't understand."&#xD;
"No, no, Maggy; I want to tell you in Latin, that I love you,&#xD;
"Let ~ne alone, sir, or you will make me spoil my sauce."&#xD;
"I'll net prevent you, Maggy, mulier mulieris."&#xD;
&#xD;
'lN~8EARCH'OF'A WIFE.&#xD;
'"What is that you' oafl rue, Master Jon~tha'n, 'a t~ule V 'I'm~&#xD;
sure I'm adacent Christian woman, and ['11 tell your.father, sir, if&#xD;
you call me 'a mule,' again !"&#xD;
"Never mind, Maggy, you are a woman; I love you, and I only&#xD;
wish to tell you so in Latin."&#xD;
"Oh ! my spinage is too salty, let inc alone; sir, I tell you."&#xD;
"'Say then with me, Amo tild, and I will kiss you if you do."&#xD;
"And shure, is it about kissing ye spake, ye little fellow? why'&#xD;
ye are hardly big enough to leave your mother's apron strings. Let&#xD;
me alone, I tell you !"&#xD;
"Maggy, Formosum pastor Gorydon ardebat A1ext~a," and he-&#xD;
bellowed the words out, so that Maggy could not help hearing him.&#xD;
"I don't knoW those people, said Maggy, but I'll tell your father'&#xD;
of your behaviour, Sir."&#xD;
And little Jonathan went out of ~he kitchen, after giving a~&#xD;
striking indication of the amatory disposition of his youth, which&#xD;
augured well for the mature development of his manhood.&#xD;
When the dinner hour had arrived and they were all seated at~'&#xD;
the table, Maggy brought in the pigeons and the spinage, but the&#xD;
former. was burnt, and the latter was so salty, that they couldn't&#xD;
eat it, and they scolded her well for her carelessness.&#xD;
"It's your son's fault, sir; he's always poking himself in the&#xD;
kitchen and is constantly behind my back. He wanted to teach me-&#xD;
Latin and talked about kissing. I told hirri to go away and he'&#xD;
wouldn't."&#xD;
The father scowled at his boy, and told Maggy to hold her tongue~&#xD;
She pouted as she left the room, and the thing passed over.&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck senior was a native of New Bedford, ana a~&#xD;
whaler by trade. He had made many voyages to the Pacific and been'&#xD;
successful in business. His conversation was generally engrossed&#xD;
with the perils and dangers of the deep, and he took great pleasure&#xD;
in descanting on the incidents of whale fishing. He passed hours"&#xD;
together in explaining how they separated the oil from the blubber,~.&#xD;
and at last ~his Aconversatioll partook of the terms peculiar to his.&#xD;
employment, and when anything did not please him, or he did not-&#xD;
rightly understand it, he was in the habit of saying, "it's aW&#xD;
blubber."&#xD;
It is surprising how a father's peculiarities will descend to the&#xD;
son, and how much he partakes of the nature and character of his -&#xD;
disposition. JonathanQOldbuck junior showed this in after life, for'&#xD;
when anything extraordinary occurred, or he could not well account:&#xD;
for it, he used his father's expression, and distinguished the shadow"&#xD;
from th~ substance.&#xD;
His father died before he had reached the age of manhood, leaving&#xD;
)xim, his only son, under the charge of his mother, who devoted her:&#xD;
maternal cares towards the development of th~ hopeful youth.'&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck junior had, as we have before said, furnishoJ~'&#xD;

It is rather disagreeable to receivee such letters, particularly when&#xD;
~ person begins to labor under the impression that his loves returned,&#xD;
s&amp;amp;~OIdbuck flew into a rage, crumpled the note in his hands, and&#xD;
mnrmuro4 'a~ follows,: "She did well enough to write me as much,&#xD;
'I 'never'lo~red her, I couldn't' bear hei~, 12 intended telling her so to-&#xD;
morrow.~ The nasty,, impudent creature, and to write about 'the'&#xD;

women .weie sordid, and unless I inspired passion, never to marry.&#xD;

It Was in the afternoon of the same day' he received this 'letter,&#xD;
that 'he entered the rest&amp;amp;urant, iii which we llrst introduced him to&#xD;
our readers, ahd of course his temperwas 'rather sourOd 'from having'&#xD;
r~eived such ~m epistle. '&#xD;
~fle looked around' and saw 'a rnotleyv group 'seated at the tables. lie&#xD;
w~ inclined 'to judge rather severely of the characters of the' people.&#xD;
whW were, ~seeknbled there, and' when he returned home, he told his&#xD;
rrrMher what his thbughts~were on the subject.&#xD;
'He said he saw a pale-faced young man, who ate 'so ravenously,&#xD;
that he thought he had not partaken of ~Tood for a week; he had'&#xD;
a ~iVnken eye, 'distended' nostrils and his whois features indicated that&#xD;
he~'Mra~ bb1d~ring on' starvation. He fancied he was a writer,' far'&#xD;
hishat was filled with papers, which were covered with writing, and&#xD;
as~don~ as he eat his dinner, he hurriedly took his departure.: "Poor~&#xD;
feW~w," said Jonathan to his mother, "if I thought he was in want,&#xD;
I would wil#ngly give him assistance. I dare say he w~s some poor&#xD;
forh~rra author, wh&amp;amp;wcaried his brains to furnish manuscripts for the&#xD;
p~lilishers, and who, as it very often happens, gets his labor for 'his&#xD;
palii~.          '                                    '    '&#xD;
"There was a~iother, whose sharpbpointed features and peering eye~'&#xD;
indicated' that'he belonged to a class, who were in the habit of prey.~&#xD;
ingon mankind. They are called' lawyers; but as you know, father,&#xD;
whu wasaIways fond ~of usiOg terms wl~ich he learnt at sea, used to&#xD;
calI:therri sharks, a kind' of fish t~iat preyed on all others,' and whou~'&#xD;
they were caught, were found to be so fat, that' they almost IflIrSt&#xD;
from repletion.&#xD;
#" It dl4'ixt"soexi~' to be the case with him, for ~it I could judge froriL&#xD;
the spare meal he made, he had not' much shot in his looker,' asfar.~&#xD;
&#xD;
IN S~ARCII OF A WlF~&#xD;
thor used to say; I could swear he was a lawyer, for there was a grot&#xD;
~1eal of cunning in his eyes, and he seemed to me as if he could pee&#xD;
~hrongh a stone wall. He was cute enough, as we say down east,&#xD;
and if I had a case in court, I would willingly.give it to him.&#xD;
"There was a plough.boy, too, he eat, oh my, how he did eat! He&#xD;
'eras so fat, that he weighed more than the two others put together.&#xD;
was evident, that he had been brought np in the country, and did&#xD;
ui$ wear out his mind and body by toiling in a garret or working at&#xD;
court. Farmers are, after all, happier than lawyers and authors&#xD;
p~t together. They sow and reap harvests, whilst lawyers some~&#xD;
ti4ues reap them, without being put to the trouble of sowing, and,&#xD;
as for authors, I'm told, they neither sow nor reap, and are generally&#xD;
so poor and needy that they can be distinguished by their worn-out&#xD;
hat and thread-hare garments."&#xD;
'~Jonathan, my boy, when are you going to marry ?"&#xD;
'~1Earriage again, mother!" and he took a candle and went to bed&#xD;

macy with certain linen drapers and dry goods merchants, who had&#xD;
4heir mansions in the avenues. Although Switzer was comparatively&#xD;
poor, the disparity between their condition did not prevent them&#xD;
'from &amp;amp;x~asionally seeing each other, for it was not with them, as it is&#xD;
with most people, wealth did not engenger pride, nor did they forget&#xD;
that they first began life by measuring a yard of tape or showing a&#xD;
piece of calico.&#xD;
The Miss Switzers were not beautiful, although Louisa, who was&#xD;
the youngest, had some pretensions to symmetry, both in face and&#xD;
figure. The three eldest were not even handsome, their father's fea-&#xD;
tur0s were imprinted on their faces, they had long flat noses, very&#xD;
light eyes, which partook of the color of 'the feline race, wide mouths,&#xD;
irregular teeth, and thick lips; their complexion was of a whitey-&#xD;
brownish' tint, here and there speckled with a few spots, ~khich&#xD;
could not be mistaken for dimples, but which, in the shade, looked&#xD;
as if they had been the victims of the smallpox. Martha, Jane,&#xD;
and Eliza, were bordering on that age, when ladies are looking out&#xD;
earnestly for beaux, and were beginning to express their surprise&#xD;
that men were insensible to their charms. Louisa; the youngest,&#xD;
had the family features, and no one could mistake her for a Switzer,&#xD;
but' 'she was young, and youth adds charms to females generally.&#xD;
Besides, she was the only one in the family who could play on the&#xD;
piano, and whert she sang, all eyes were turned to her, admiring the&#xD;
melody of her voice, and the brilliance of her execution.&#xD;
The house was not furnished very fashionably, for the father had&#xD;
bought secondhand furniture, and the plush-covered seat~, which&#xD;
were once scarlet, had become so dirty from use, that you could not&#xD;
well distinguish the color. The tables were of mahogany,' but of a&#xD;
light color, and were so much scratched by the children 'w~hen they'&#xD;
Were young, that the varnish was iii many places almost e*itirely off'&#xD;

th~w~ather duly descanted upor~, there was a dead silence, for none&#xD;
seemed to be overburdened with the materials for conversation.&#xD;
~!rSwit~e~ beckoned to his wife to go in to supper, and she in&#xD;
turz~ beokone~ to her daughters. Mr Oldbuok could not do otherE&#xD;
wisetlian, offerjus arm to Miss Louisa, and the procession being&#xD;
formed~ the mother followed up the rear with a smirk on her oounte~&#xD;
nance, as if all h~r projects had already become matured.&#xD;
~Phe party was seated at the tea table, where Miss Louisa did th'e&#xD;
honors with a grace, which must have been as pleasing to her&#xD;
mother as her admirer. Neither Martha, Jane, or Eliza, opened&#xD;
their lips, during the greater part of the time they were at table,&#xD;
and' all seemed to be intent on the few words that escaped from their&#xD;
guQst.&#xD;
~Ie first spoke about the theatres, then the Museum, then about&#xD;
the play, that was performed there, "The Serious. Family," Mr~&#xD;
Aminadab Sleek, and all the rest of the peculiar characters, with&#xD;
whioli it abounded~ $e finally wound up,, by giving a general in-&#xD;
vi~ition to the whole family to visit the Museum with him on the&#xD;
following evening.&#xD;
"You are too good," said the mother.&#xD;
5' )1~eall.y, I shoxdd be delighted,~' said Martha, and there was a&#xD;
general titter throughout the company, which betokened their ad~.&#xD;
miration of Mr Oldbuok's generosity, and. the pleasure they should~&#xD;
de*iye from accepting his invitation.&#xD;
The cenvers~tiori at the table began to wax low, and there was&#xD;
evidently a dearth of matter to afford them topics for continuing it,&#xD;
when Mr Switzer rose first, and apologizing for his unavoidable;ab..&#xD;
sence, begged to be excused, as he had an account to settle for&#xD;
ecr~e hem~ he had bought in the morning.&#xD;
When the ladies returned to the parlor, they entered a short time&#xD;
into conversation, when Mr Oldbuck expressed his wish, that one&#xD;
of the ladies should perform on the piano.&#xD;
Martha looked at her mother, and Jane looked at Eliza, and all&#xD;
~eemed to be in a state 'of consternation at the question that was~&#xD;
put to them, and of doubt ~t the answer they should give, when the&#xD;
mother broke silence~ and said, "that Louisa was the only one who&#xD;
could play on the piano." 'Mrs Switzer took good care to add,&#xD;
"that her daughter Louisa, had, received an excellent musical'&#xD;
education, and could sing very well, if she pleased."&#xD;
"gay I have the extreme felicity," said Jonathan Oldbuck, to~&#xD;
hear a song from Miss Louisa. "Now do, Miss," said he, "your&#xD;
rnot~ier'e remarks have quite raised my expectations, and I'm sure&#xD;
I sho ~1d be, enchanted with it."&#xD;
There was an evident twitching of the mouth, and a contortion'&#xD;
of poor ~fiss Louisa's countenance, as she reluctantly complied&#xD;
wi4h the request, ~ut assured Mr. .Oldb~iok that she seldom Mug.&#xD;
"Now don't say so, Louisa, for you're chirping all day," said the&#xD;
&#xD;
IN. SEARCH OF A WIFL&#xD;
&#xD;
mother.' "' You wake tue in the' mornings with your singing, aiid&#xD;
you are strumming constantly on the piano."&#xD;
And poor Louisa. sat down to the piano, and sang the "Rose of&#xD;
Allandale," with her notes pitched to 1~' sharp, and in such a clear&#xD;
shrill voice, that' it might have been heard at the distance of a mile.&#xD;
When the last line of the last verse was concluded, Mr Oldbuck&#xD;
expressed his delight at the able manner in which she had executed&#xD;
the piece, and the sweetness and melody of her voice. He hung&#xD;
over the piano in an attitude which expressed all his abandon &amp;amp; o~,&#xD;
devotedness to the object of his attachment; he could not find&#xD;
terms wherein to express his sense of the obligations he was under&#xD;
to the fair lady for the treat she had afforded him, and was going&#xD;
on to request a similar favor, when a loud rap was heard at the'&#xD;
door, and who should enter but Mr Charles Seagrave, the gentle~&#xD;
man who, Louisa told him, had presented her with the piece of&#xD;
music which he so much admired.&#xD;
Mr Seagrave having saluted the company, and shaken han~Ia&#xD;
with the ladies, kept hold of that of Miss Louisa's longer than&#xD;
usual, or that Mr Oldbuck thought was necessary. Seagrave&#xD;
remained in conversation with Miss Louisa for some time, very much&#xD;
to the discomfiture of~ Mrs Switzer, and to the annoyance of&#xD;
Oldbuck, who shuffled about on his chair as if he had been seized&#xD;
with an attack of" St. "Vitis' dance."&#xD;
The' charm was indeed dissolved the moment Mr Charles Sea-&#xD;
grave made his appearance, for Louisa's attention was wholly~&#xD;
absorbed in his interesting conversation. He spoke of the pleasure&#xD;
they had at the last party they were at, how agreeable was their&#xD;
walk home, and how much he should enjoy. another stroll by moon.&#xD;
light, all of which greeted very harshly ~ the ears of Oldbuck, and:&#xD;
disconcerted the mother's plans. She, gave several wincing glances&#xD;
at her daughter, which Louisa, however, did not take any notice~&#xD;
of, but continued speaking with her Charley, unmindful of her~&#xD;
mother or her admirer. ,&#xD;
Mr Seagrave having concluded his conversation with Louisa,;&#xD;
began talking polities with the mother, and they necessarily turned'&#xD;
on the annexation of Cuba, Mr Seagrave taking care t~ mention's&#xD;
(at the same time casting a glance at Louisa,) that he was a mem~&#xD;
ber of the "Lone Star" Association, and that he was resolved to die&#xD;
in the attempt to annex Cuba with this country. His remarks&#xD;
were very patriotic, and excited a good deal' of attention, but they&#xD;
were evidently displeasing to Oldbuck, who. would have preferred'&#xD;
to hear Miss Louisa sing, or engage her in conversations.&#xD;
Charley Seagrave was a young man of a rather prepossessing ap.:&#xD;
pearance; he was thin, which Mr Oldbuok was not; he wore a bl&amp;amp;e&#xD;
.coat with brass buttons, and Mr Oldbuck's was black, and he 'had~&#xD;
~a peculiar manner of dangling his pocket-handkerchief, which give&#xD;
him quite a distingue' air izi Miss Louisa's opinion.' In fact, he wa~&#xD;

with her hands in her lap, admiring the graceful form of the, fair&#xD;
Louisa&#xD;
"Whatdo you think, Jifliza.?" asked Louisa.&#xD;
the       IL think 1.ou look like a fright in that&#xD;
and if I were in your place, woul send it back to the&#xD;

doubtful, arid 5hi~ remarked in answer to. her daughter's question,&#xD;
Louisa resolved. ~     child, ~ou always look lovely."&#xD;

the four sisters, availing themselves&#xD;
~~would have liseri accepted by possibly he may not have conceived,&#xD;

{       The "Serious Family" was then in full vogue, and had been&#xD;
nightly repeated for the last three weeks. Mr. Aminadab Sleek,&#xD;
had entertained 'the audience with his drolleries and Vagaries, and&#xD;
~ I~ ~ had drawn down thunders of applause, whenever he appeared pa&#xD;
the scene.&#xD;
*a~ But Jonathan O1~lbuck's plaudits exceeded all others; and when&#xD;
the hero of the pioee W~ rather more interesting than usual, his&#xD;
cheers amounted to a degree ,of"~ vociferation, which attracted the&#xD;
whole audience.&#xD;
p       Louisa, who wa~ seated next to him, begged of him to be silent,&#xD;
but he still launched forth into the wildest bursts of enthusiasm.&#xD;
Their situation became really unpleasant, and it was with joy&#xD;
they greeted the falling of the curtain.&#xD;
On their way home, Jonathan Oldbuck became rather bolder in&#xD;

agreeable.&#xD;
"I don't know what to say at present," replied Louia, very&#xD;
artlessly.&#xD;
Oldbuck becoming more importunate, said, "May I not have the&#xD;
pleasure of aspiring to your hand, Louisa, at some future day '!,~&#xD;
"Really, Mr Oldbuck," said Louisa, "after our short ~acquaint..&#xD;
anoo~ 1 did not expect this speedy avowal."&#xD;

at the door, begged him pressingly to enter and take some refresk.~&#xD;

,CHAPTER III.&#xD;
MATERNAL REFLECTIONS-OOOD ADVICE-SALLY~ IN ANOTHER QURTEEJ&#xD;
(BUT HOPES I)OOMFsD TO BE DISAPPOINTED-MISS SYI'ORAH CLEMENTS.&#xD;
WHEN Jonathan dldbuok came down to breakfast the following&#xD;
rriorning, ha appeared rather paler than usual, and his mother,'wh.&#xD;
always expressed ,the most anxious solicitude for her son's health,&#xD;
inquired at what hour he came in on the previous evening.&#xD;
'The son 'replied that it was early, and that he had been spending&#xD;
the' evening with the Switzers.&#xD;
"What, have 'you been wasting your time with that vulgar&#xD;
family? I'm sure there is none of them that ought to engage your&#xD;
attention; they're an ugly, flat-nosed, thick-lipped, set of girls, and&#xD;
I'm surprised you should find anything in them to attract your&#xD;
notice."&#xD;
"Mother," said Jonathan, "I thought at first Louisa was rather&#xD;
interesting, but I've since had reason to change my opinion. She&#xD;
has no conversation, her manners are vulgar, as you say, and I&#xD;
think 'she dresses' rather indecently, for her gown is made too low-&#xD;
waisted~and she doesn't wear any scarf."&#xD;
"The nasty, vnlgar thing," said Mrs Oldbuck. "I wonder her&#xD;
mother allows it. IL never'admired those girls, and as for the three&#xD;
eldest, they have necks as long as storks, and their noses reach&#xD;
almost to their chins. As for Louisa, she is a port, flippant, little&#xD;
thing, a~nd if I were her mother, I would confine her to the house,&#xD;
and make her sew all day."&#xD;
Jonathan's feelings corresponded with those of his mother's, for&#xD;
he was angry with the Switzers, and felt particularly indignant&#xD;
that Miss Louisa Switzer should not have responded to his profes-&#xD;
sions of love.&#xD;
He agreed with his mother that he had been mis-spending his&#xD;
time, and decided on making amends for the future, by directing&#xD;
his attention in another quarter.&#xD;
(G I'm sure there's the Olements, and the Smiths, and a host of&#xD;
other families, who would be proud to receive you,.and happy to&#xD;
make your acquaintance. In fact Mrs Clernents was here the&#xD;
other day, and almost insinuated as much as that she should like&#xD;
my son to visit her daughter. Theophilus Ciements is a rich man,&#xD;
&#xD;
'4&#xD;
.Tonathai~, I knew him when ho was a boy; his father was an old.&#xD;
beau of mine, and I should 'certaitily have married him, had~ ther8&#xD;
not been so 'great a disparity between our ages."&#xD;
This brought up sad reflections upon poor Jonathan's mind, ~or&#xD;
he thought he would encounter much difficulty in engaging the&#xD;
affections pf Miss Syporah Clenients, for the same reason that his&#xD;
mother had refused her father.&#xD;
He knew the young lady in question, but his ambition had never&#xD;
extended to seeking the hand of the rich Mr. Clements" daughter,&#xD;
and when his mother threw out the suggest&#xD;
response in his bosom.      ,         on, it met with a ready&#xD;
Three o'clock had hardly struck by the time-piece in the parlor,&#xD;
when Jonathan Oldbuck, with a neat surtout tightly buttoned to&#xD;
show off the proportion of his fine person, with his boots polished like&#xD;
a mirror, his hat made after the -latest fall fashion, and his cane in&#xD;
hand, sallied out to walk in the direction of Mr Clenients' house,&#xD;
and solicit an interview with the lovely Syporah.&#xD;
Giving a fashionable rat-tat-tat at the knocker, he was admitted&#xD;
into the drawing-room, where Mrs Clements and her daughter were&#xD;
receiving their visitors.&#xD;
Every thing wore an air of rigidity 'in this house, to which&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck was not at all accustomed. The door was&#xD;
opened by a man-servant, who was habited in 'a neat costume, his&#xD;
i~ame was announced rather loudly, and he was ushered into the&#xD;
room, which was covered with a rich Wilton carpet, and in which&#xD;
the furniture generally was very different from that which he had&#xD;
seen at-the Switzers. There was ,a rich rose-wood piano, the sofas&#xD;
and chairs made, of the same material, were )covered with fawn-&#xD;
colored damask satin, and the curtains corresponded, there were&#xD;
beautiful mirrors, hanging on the wall, and every thing betokened&#xD;
an air of elegance and grandeur.&#xD;
Miss Syporah. Clemonts was seated in one of the fauteuils, Which&#xD;
was capacious enough to accommodate another of her rather&#xD;
diminutive size. She could not have been over seventeen years of&#xD;
age, for there was a sprightliness about her person which betokened&#xD;
youth and vivacity, her face was rather~ remarkable for beauty, she&#xD;
hada sparkling blue eye, her hair was auburn, and her nose and&#xD;
chin were so well proportioned, that they set off her ether features&#xD;
to advantage; she had a pearly set of teeth, her skin was beauti-&#xD;
fully white, and 'her complexion had that 'rosy tint which is so&#xD;
agreeable to most men. In fine, Jonathan Oldbuck' could not have&#xD;
desired that Nature should have modelled a creature of finer pro.&#xD;
portions to suit his taste.&#xD;
After strutting into the room in the most fashionable manner,&#xD;
and with that dktingue air which, he faiicied, he could at times&#xD;
assume, saluting the ladies of the house, he seated himself near an&#xD;
old maid, whose rustling silk dress he was afraid of spoiling, from&#xD;

Jonathan Oldbuck's. anticipations ran quite in another ol~anne1,&#xD;
for when he returned home, su~h was the excess ~f 1ii~ jo~ 'at' th~2&#xD;
unexpected reception. he had met with, tha4 he oould~ hardly esti'ain&#xD;
his emotion.&#xD;
"She's perfectly lovely, mother, and I should be the happiest of&#xD;
men, jf I could indulge the hope for a moment, that s'he tild b&amp;amp;&#xD;
come my wife."&#xD;
"I think, Jonathan, after what passed between Mrs Clements and&#xD;
myself the other day, that it would be wrong in you to visit th~&#xD;
house, without first making known your intention~ to the father.&#xD;
You'll find him a worthy, sensible man, and I've no doubt, he w4l&#xD;
listen, to your proposals with attention.',&#xD;
"Mother, I scarcely kndw the girl yet, and how can I speak to the&#xD;
father about the matter you refer to, without first gaining her &amp;amp;fTeo-&#xD;
tions ?"&#xD;
"That's what I wish to avoid, my boy, for I think it very wron~&#xD;
indeed, for young gentlemen to insinuate themselves into the affec.&#xD;
tions of young ladies, without first making known tb~eir intentions,&#xD;
to the parents, besides I hav&amp;amp;too high respect for TheophilusOleni&#xD;
ents to do him an injury, and with the graces and pec~liar charms&#xD;
you possess, it would be wrong to win the lady's heart, without&#xD;
first obtaining the father's consent."&#xD;
Jonathan seemed also to be of the same opinion, at first he was&#xD;
rather doubtful, but his mother's argument were so irresistible,&#xD;
that he soon coincided with her, and resolved to seek an interview&#xD;
with Mr Clements on the following morning. '&#xD;
To the man of pleasure, New York affords almost as many amuse-&#xD;
ruents as the gay streets of ] ari~. In strolling through Broadway,&#xD;
there are nearly as' many Qbjeots to engage your attention, it's a&#xD;
little world in itself, and here may be see*i on a fih~ summer's after&#xD;
noon, people from every part of the globe. The swarthy Spaniard&#xD;
mixes with the fair Norwegian, and thelirunette of ih~ so~ith atferds&#xD;

their neat little ankles and graceful little feet. Thore'~ ~he fas~iiona~&#xD;

or Scotch marmalade. There~s a variety of other characters, mov-&#xD;
ing on the scene, shifting and changing about, as often as a kaleidi.-&#xD;
scope, and assuming new shapes and forms to s~uit every one's taste.&#xD;
There's that often described, but incomprehensible "Moso~' of the&#xD;
Bowery, who is never in his native element unless he's following a&#xD;
fire engine, or is "some" at a fight, and there's the "ghal," too, who&#xD;
is close on his heels, and who. thinks there's some intrinsic virtue in&#xD;
the deep scarlet shawl, which covers her bosom.&#xD;
All theso characters have been so often described, that it is tedious&#xD;
to dwell on them, but they serve to snake up a whole, which can&#xD;
only be~ seen on Broadway's wide pavement, on a fine summer's&#xD;
afternoon.&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck passed the remainder of the day, after his visit&#xD;
to Mr Clement's, by making one of the crowd that was hurrying&#xD;
through this thoroughfare, he was pushing and was pushed in his&#xD;
turn, now and then turning round to espy a young lady, whose fea.-&#xD;
tures attracted his attention, then seeing another, who he thought&#xD;
was prettier than the one that had passed, finally, his heart becom.-&#xD;
lag, so susceptiblee to the tender charms of the fair sex, tbat he&#xD;
thought them all lovely alike. In his admiration of the "human&#xD;
form diyine," of which he had so many opportunities of judging,&#xD;
he paid no attention to his pocket or his fob, and when he returned&#xD;
home found both.the one and the other minus his handkerchief and&#xD;
his watch. These, however, are only the trifling consequences of'&#xD;
that absence of mind, which is engendered by too much appreciation&#xD;
of female charms.&#xD;
~ Jonathan Oldbuck thought he would step in at Delmonico's,&#xD;
where he would regale himself after the fatigues of his walk, on a&#xD;
&#xD;
Y~ SEARCH OF A WIFE.                   29&#xD;
beefsteak and a bottle of wine. When he entered, he saw' on~ of&#xD;
his old friends, who was there' f~r the same purpose, and both ~at&#xD;
down to a meal, wl;iich was worthy of the most particular~ epicure,&#xD;
and which was served up in a nice little alcove, where they could&#xD;
enjoy an hour's pleasant conversation.&#xD;
Jonathan called for another bottle, and as an indulgence in wine&#xD;
generally leads to conversation about women, he ~deseanted at great&#xD;
length on the peculiar charms of the young lady, who, in his fond.&#xD;
imagination, had already accepted him for a suitor. The name and&#xD;
residence he withheld, but he could not find language strong enough&#xD;
to express his unbounded admiration of the lady's virtue and&#xD;
beauty.#&#xD;
Ned Hammersley, for that was his companion's name, was almost&#xD;
envious of his happiness, and stipulated, if not for an invitation, at&#xD;
least for a large share of cake and other "fixings.,~&#xD;
Jonathan Gidhuck assured him, That the moment his happiness&#xD;
was consummated, he should certainly not forget him.&#xD;
"And pray," asked Ned, "is the happy day fixed ?"&#xD;
"Why, not exactly so," replied Jonathan, "but I am to see the&#xD;
father to-morrow to settle the preliminaries."&#xD;
"Why, Oldbuck, my dear fellow, have things been pushed so far&#xD;
already? Indeed, you are a happy man, and I must congratulate&#xD;
you; but is the lady rich ?"&#xD;
"Rich, Ned. Why her father has the reputation of being a&#xD;
millionaire, and mother says he prefers me for old acquaintance&#xD;
sake."&#xD;
"Tell me her name. Oh, do!" rejoined Ned, "I'm getting quite&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck, who had already suffered "some" from the&#xD;
effects of rivalry, was sufficiently circumspect to withhold the&#xD;
name from a person of Ned's fine figure and rather handsnrie&#xD;
countenance.&#xD;
Twilight still found the friends in earnest conversation about the&#xD;
fair sex, and the shades of evening, whi~h were rapidly enveloping&#xD;
Broadway in darkness, would afford sufficient obscurity to hide the&#xD;
excesses of liquor, so the third bottle had been called for, and&#xD;
having, as they thought, indulged pretty freely, the two companions&#xD;
sallied out for a walk.&#xD;
As we have before said, Mrs Oldbuok hail not failed to put her&#xD;
son on his guard against evil associates, and the danger of Broad-&#xD;
way by gas..light. Jn fact Mr Oldbuck had an instinctive dread&#xD;
himself of vice, which assumes such alluring forms in that thorough.&#xD;
fare at night. He had taken quite enough wine to increase his&#xD;
love for woman, for the former is an article which, like alcohol,&#xD;
when it is applied to water, makes the latter boil and effervesce,&#xD;
until it becomes so inflammable, that it almost consumes the posses.&#xD;
sor. So it was with Jonathan Oldbuck, but his dread of vice was&#xD;

When Ned Hammersiey rejoined his companion after one of these&#xD;

a~ the day was to be big with his future fate in life, he lo~t no time&#xD;
in going down to breakfast, where his mother was~ pouring put a&#xD;

.A.fter he had discussed a moderate share of broiled chiofr9xi,&#xD;
plastered over with hajf a dozen buckwheat cakes fresh from t~e&#xD;
oven, ho began talking with Mrs Oldbuck on what he to e&#xD;
during the day. Ho seemed to hesitate whether he should cafl 9"&#xD;
l~~Ir Clements or not, but his mother having remarked, that "f~~t&#xD;
heart never won fair lady," his mind was made up, and he. ~es.ly~dJ&#xD;
to wait on Mr Clements after he had finished his toilet.&#xD;
Going up stairs, after admiring himself a few minutes in the&#xD;
lo~king~glass, he set earnestly to work ~o make himself 1opl~ as&#xD;
fashipnabie as possible.&#xD;
I~js boots were neatly polished, his clothes niacly brushed, ~ri~i&#xD;
~tr Oldbuek went through the ceremony of dressing with the UiQ~t&#xD;
perfect sangfroi4 imaginable; he was rather longer than uspa~ iu&#xD;
g~iying a proper tie to his cravat, and he was at a 1o88 whioh lie&#xD;
should choo~e. "First impressions. a~e generally the stror1geS~"&#xD;
thought Mr Oldbuck, and Mr Th~ophiIu~ Clements might possibly&#xD;
form a good opinion of him frogi the neatness and g~ntility of We&#xD;
dress.&#xD;
After surveying himself for a short 1~irne in the lookin~~glass~ and&#xD;
admiring his rotund figure, he went down stairs ana ask~d his&#xD;
mother how he looked?&#xD;
"Very well? indeed, my boy; now mind, play your car~s well,&#xD;

Ten o'clock had struck when Jonathan went to*see Mr Clement~.&#xD;
lit was a latterr of business, and he thought it a good time to find&#xD;
him at leisure.&#xD;
Mr  ~heophilus Clements was in his private office, a sort of sa~c-&#xD;
turn, which was, located on the second floor of his private house in.&#xD;
University Place. He had enjoined the domestics not to disturb&#xD;

* hie privacy on any.pretext whatsoever, but to send whoever might&#xD;
call on business to his counting-house in Water street.&#xD;
When ~r Oldbuck rang the bell for admittance, he was told that&#xD;
Mr Clements was engaged, and that he could not see him at pre-&#xD;
sent, he begged of the servant to go up stairs and tell his master&#xD;
that he wished to see him on very urgent business.&#xD;
Mr Clements was rather surprised at such an unexpected visit&#xD;
so early in the morning, and at once directed the servant to send&#xD;
the gentleman up into his room.&#xD;
He was introduced into a magnificent apartment, where he found&#xD;
Mr Theophilus Clements dressed in a rich Persian morning gown,&#xD;
and embroidered slippers, comfortably ensconced in a large arm-&#xD;
chair, and seated at a writing desk.&#xD;
Mr Clements belonged to that rather numerous class of persons&#xD;
who were at first unsuccessful in business, and having failed, had&#xD;
managed to save ,a large share of the profits of the concern for his&#xD;
own individual benefit.&#xD;
jie was the projector and manager of that enterprising company&#xD;
which was originally started under the name of the "Lake Winne-&#xD;
peg Copper Mine Association," in which so many persons had em-&#xD;
barked, and invested a great part of their capital. The stock&#xD;
immediately rese in the market, and reached on Change the&#xD;
enormous rate of one hundred and fifty-three per centum. There&#xD;
was quite an emulation amongst the citizens to become share-&#xD;
holders, and all augured the brightest prospects from the able man-&#xD;
agement of Mr. Theophilus Clements.&#xD;
Fall came round, and with the falling of the' leaves, the bright&#xD;
hopes of the share-holders fell to the ground, and in the first annual&#xD;
report, which was published, it appeared, that the large sum of,&#xD;
thirI~y thousand dollars had been expended in reports of geologists,&#xD;
* outfitting of the miners, and the erection of smelting furnaces, but&#xD;
not a word was said in it of the extent of the copper, save towards&#xD;
the end, a distant allusion was made to a rather "rich vein," that&#xD;
had been 'discovered, and which perhaps ran in union with Mr&#xD;
Theophilus Clements' deep cogitations on the subject. He wound uj&#xD;
- his report, by apologizing for the outlay, which he accounted for by&#xD;
the, enormous expenses of the first outfit, and promised economy, &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
for the fntt~e.&#xD;
The bait however would not take, and shares fell to an enormous&#xD;
discount.' Mr Clements bought them all in, at the current rate,&#xD;
* which was about three per cent on the share's of a hundred dollars&#xD;
paid in, and this was the beginning and end of his fortune.&#xD;
Mr Clements at once knew Oldbuck from having met~iim in the&#xD;
streets, and 'tried (from his former intimacy with his father) to&#xD;
prevail on him to tako shares in the "Lake Winnepeg Cop"per Mine&#xD;
Association." Oldbuck's mind was then impervious to Mr Olenibnts'~&#xD;
&#xD;
IN SEARCH OF A WIFE.                   33'&#xD;
arguments, and the latter must at least have had a good opinion, of&#xD;
his 'cuteness and penetration.&#xD;
So on entering the room, Clements at once recognized Oldbuok,&#xD;
and tendering him his hand, begged him to be seated.&#xD;
"Well, good morning, my dear friend, I'm happy to see you&#xD;
Pardon me if I receive you in my dressing-gown, but I went to bed&#xD;
very late last night, I was out, but never - mind, pray what is your&#xD;
business my good Sir ?"&#xD;
Oldbuck took a seat, and saw with pleasure, that Mrs Clements&#xD;
was not in the room, he first began the conversation by telling Mr&#xD;
Clements of Mrs Clements' visit to his mother, then spoke about the&#xD;
pleasure of his acquaintance with his daughter, and finally brought&#xD;
round the topic to marriage.&#xD;
Okibuck's point was gained so far, and he said&#xD;
"Mr Clements, I've an object in calling on you, you're my'&#xD;
father's old friend, and I've come to tell you, that I wish to get&#xD;
married. I want to put a stop to the follies of a bachelor's life, and&#xD;
to undertake thee responsibility of a wife and children, if Heaven&#xD;
should grant me such a blessing; I think it the consummation of&#xD;
man's ~appiness.~~&#xD;
Mr Theophilus Clements shuffled about in his morning-gown, and'&#xD;
began to laugh.&#xD;
"My friend, you ma~ marry, if such be your wish, but I would&#xD;
advise you to make a good match, I mean by that, a rich one, for&#xD;
those only are good. One must place his name and family, like his&#xD;
money, at good interest in these times."&#xD;
"I can assure you, Sir, replied Jonathan, that I've no sort of&#xD;
interest in the proposition which I've come here to make to you.&#xD;
I've seen your daughter several times, and yesterday had the plea-&#xD;
sure of rather a long interview with her. I am not insensible to her&#xD;
very great charms, in fact, she pleases me very much, and I've come&#xD;
to ask of you, her hand in marriage."&#xD;
Mr Theoi~ilus Clements drew himself up in his arm chair, as-&#xD;
sumed a niore serious look, and scrutinizing Oldbuck in a way,, as&#xD;
if he had never before set eyes on him, or as one whose character&#xD;
he wished to know more of, said ,to him, in a tone ef voice,, which&#xD;
partook no longer of politeness,                -&#xD;
"Is it my daughter's hand you have come to ask me for ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Oldbuck, "it is her hand."&#xD;
"'Ah! that's a verx different thing. I didn't expect it. I&#xD;
suppose, you have wffi her heart, (the father giving a searching&#xD;
glance at Oldbuck) for that, you know is preliminary to asking her&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
Oldbuck was going to reply, when Mr Clementa continued&#xD;
"I know very little of your pecuniary affairs, I always took you'&#xD;
to be a man of moderate means, but I may have been mistaken, and&#xD;
possibly your fortune may be equal ~to mine. Excuse me, my dear&#xD;

- O~upk was at a loss to. know ~hat to say, here was an unfor..&#xD;
seen' difficulty, whioh 'he was 'not prepared to meet.&#xD;
Mr Clements observing his trepidation, came to his relief, and&#xD;
~eaid :-&#xD;
"Now, betwee~i friends, tell me how much you are worth, in&#xD;
'property, as in money ?"&#xD;
Oldbuck fixed his spectacles in their proper place, rubbed one of&#xD;
'i1ip" ears, and replied&#xD;
That he was worth somethingg 'between eight and nine hundred&#xD;
dollars a year, in "United St~tes 6's."&#xD;
~ What is that you say," asked Mr Clements, "eight or nine&#xD;
hundred dollars a year, in 'United States 6's.' 1 may not properly&#xD;
have understood you, perhaps you mean those are the stockss you&#xD;
hold~ have you no other property, or money ?"&#xD;
"' I ha~ve tile honor to tell you, Sir," said Oldbuok, "that all my&#xD;
revenues together, do not exceed' nine hundred dollars per annum."&#xD;
Mr Clem6nts 'again., drew himself back in his arm chair; and&#xD;
arranging' the folds of his morning go~.vn~ burst out into 'a loud&#xD;
'laugh.&#xD;
"'Ah! ah! ah!    *     *    *    *   'Ah! ah! ahl joking&#xD;
~s very good at times, I thought you were serious at first, you are a,&#xD;
funny fellow, my 4ear Oldbuck, but I did not think you would carry&#xD;
the jqke~ so far, it's very funny, indeed it is," and Mr Theophilus&#xD;
"Clements again gave vent to his merriment.&#xD;
"A joke, 3~Er Clemente, I can assure you, I am not joking at all,&#xD;
I have nine hundred dollars revenue, and for new beginners it is&#xD;
~quite enoii~h. 'I've not come here to know how much I shall get&#xD;

"Ah ah! "~h! it's very am~Using, my daughter who will get a&#xD;

"' Ww, nothing.," rejoined Oldbuck, "why I've ju~ been telling&#xD;
'gou hQw much I am worth, Sir."&#xD;
"" I will b~t, Oldbuck," said Olements, "that this is 'the result of&#xD;
wager, which somebody has been taking with you, to see how-I&#xD;
should4 aet in the matter," and he could not again restrain his&#xD;
'laughter.&#xD;
"Sir," said Qldbuol~, "it is the i~esu1t' of no wager, I assure you.&#xD;

new thought struck him, and suingig his seat, he said rather&#xD;

it flowed like water, and what with a few musicians front jDod~-&#xD;

and Syporah was very much pleased."&#xD;
The husband and father became rather irritated, as Charlotte was&#xD;
reciting the luxuries of the supper table, and pet1~ishly observed,&#xD;
"that such feasts in many cases prognosticate long fasts, and h8&#xD;
believed Mr Fitz Simmons would find it so.~&#xD;
"This will never do, this will never do," said Mr Theophihis&#xD;
Cl&amp;amp;ments, rising from his arm chair, and striding up and down the&#xD;
room in his long morning-gown and embroidered slippers. "For the&#xD;
future, you must let me know, who are Syporah's admirers. I have&#xD;
no idea of her contracting a mesalliance as the French term it, and&#xD;
as she will have some, money, I dare say many worthless young&#xD;
men will be paying their addresses to her."&#xD;
"You need'nt be afraid," said Charlotte, "that she will do any.&#xD;
thing against my wishes, she is a kind affectionate creature."&#xD;
"There's been a matter on my mind, for some time past," said Mr&#xD;
~Theophilus Clements to his wife, "which I've been wishing to&#xD;
~broach both to Syporab. and yourself. There's my old friend Isaiah&#xD;
*~ibson, who became a widower last year, he has a sneaking regard&#xD;
for Syporab., I know he has, and you should cultivate it as mu'ch as&#xD;
possible. He's rich, has an elegant house,. and moves in the best&#xD;
circles of society, he would make an excellent husband 'for my&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
"Isaiah Gibson !" ejaculated Charlotte, "why he's old enough to&#xD;
be her father, that bald-headed, red-faced fellow, to be my Syporah's&#xD;
husband, why the poor girl would go into fits, if he even approached&#xD;
"That's the reasonn" said the father, "I wish to mention the&#xD;
subject to you, the girl must not be indulged in her whims. Pve&#xD;
set my mind on it, and you know (placing a peculiar 'emphasis on.&#xD;
the last word) that I generally have my way. He has monet, and&#xD;
those. only know how to value it, who have been at the most pains in&#xD;
~aking it."&#xD;
"I know that," said Charlotte, "but isaiah Gibson, 'Angels and&#xD;
ministers of grace defend ~is,' I shall not even mention it to&#xD;
~Syporah,~' and Mrs Theophilus Clernents banged the door az~d went&#xD;
~ut of the room in a passion.&#xD;
Jonathan Old~buck spent the day pretty much in the same manner&#xD;
in which. he had passed the previous one, excepting that he tok a&#xD;
quiet dinner with his mother, who was particularly inquisitive' to&#xD;
find out the ~esul~ 'of his interview with Mr Clements.&#xD;

in the morning.&#xD;
of Mr Theophilus Clements was more irritable than usual, the events&#xD;
tho morning did i~ot altogether please him, and what happened&#xD;
during the remainder .bf the day, did not tend to increase his coin-&#xD;
posure. He had been trying rather unsuccessfully to engage a few&#xD;
of his friends to take shares in another company, which he had&#xD;
lately formed to reclaim a valuable traot of land, which was well&#xD;
adapted for purposes of cultivation, but he could not induce any or&#xD;
them to enter into his views.&#xD;
' He was thinking over the matte'rF when Jonathan Qidhuck&#xD;
entered, and his appearance in such an inopportune moment had no&#xD;
~ffeet in making him more agreeable.&#xD;
"Sit down, Sir," said Mr Theophilus Clements, to Mr Jonathan&#xD;
Oldbuck, "pray, what is your business? Ah! I remember, mar-&#xD;
?iage and so forth.&#xD;
"Ycu are too poor, Sir, I told you so in the morning, and there&#xD;
was no necessity for your returning to get the same answer in the&#xD;
~evening. 'A word to the wise,' &amp;amp;c., you know my old boy," and&#xD;
tapping him on the shoulder, said, "you had better look out and fish&#xD;
in a~iothor quarter. If I remember rightly, my old school fellow,&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck, your father, I mean, managed to scrape together&#xD;
~a few hundred dollars out of the greasy business, in which he was&#xD;
engaged, and with what he has left you, you ought to be able to&#xD;
procure a suitable partner in life, who will jog along with you pretty&#xD;
much in.your own way."&#xD;
"Mr Clements," said Jonathan, "I did not come here to be in-&#xD;
Lulted. You laughed at me this morning, and you insult me this&#xD;
evening. 1 love your daughter, 'and&#xD;
"Confound your love," said Theophilus Clements, "you are too&#xD;
poor, and I bid you good evening, ~5ir."&#xD;
Jonathan Old~uck made his exit, muttering between his teeth,&#xD;
"~ you're an impudent fellow," &amp;amp;c., but thinking "discretion the&#xD;
better part of valor," did not say it&#xD;
Clernents.                    loud enough to be heard by Mr&#xD;

Y.AIR &amp;amp;NJ~A.&#xD;
W~1EN Jonathan Qidhuck rose in the morning, he wa~ in a m~iet&#xD;
phil9sophic mood, he thought on the ~anitie~ 'of human life, and&#xD;
p~de~ed.over the inordinate ambition of ~narxkind. Aftor all, life&#xD;

As for the Clements, they were a purse.proud, ignora~v ~et, andhe&#xD;
w~xdered why his 'mother ~hduld -have tdld him to ,a'll on ~uoh&#xD;
pe~ple.&#xD;
When he was again seatedit the breaki~ttabls, he rbmonet±~t~d&#xD;
with her on ihe ;itnprejifiety 'of 'her conduct, and ~~dd 'tli~t he 'would&#xD;
not take her advice for the future.&#xD;
" Jonathan, 'n1y'-b~y," -said MrsOldbuok,"' p~hs-t~'~ bebn.&#xD;

"Why, mama, you to~d me, and ~&#xD;
"I never told yoti~, ohiidto ask for ~&#xD;
her; I only said it was improper to engage her affections before you&#xD;
had spoken to the father to get permission to visit the house. You've&#xD;
been too quick, Jonathan."&#xD;
Jonathan felt as if his mother were right, and he inwardly re~&#xD;
broached himself for~having used more of the fortitet in re than the&#xD;
snaviter in modo, in his nt~gooiations with the Clernents.&#xD;
However, to a man of the world, like Jonathan Oldbuek, the&#xD;
contre temps, which he had experienced at the hands of Mr Theophi.&#xD;
Ins Clements, did not weigh long on his mind, and he begged of his&#xD;
mother, as a favor, not to refer to the subject again.&#xD;
At his usual flour he went out to take his afternoon's walk, and&#xD;
&#xD;
-       IN SEARCH OF A WIFE.&#xD;
meetiiig with his friend, Ned Hammersicy, they both repaired to&#xD;
Thompson's for a lunch.&#xD;
On their way there, Ned Hammersicy asked Jonathan what day&#xD;
had been fixed for the celebration of his nuptials?&#xD;
"With whom do you mean ?" asked Mr Oldbuek.&#xD;
"Why, with that rich and beautiful girl, whose praises you&#xD;
sounded so extravagantly the other night, that you almost excited&#xD;
my jealousy."&#xD;
"Pooh! pooh !" said Jonathan; "it was only a joke, Ned, and. I&#xD;
wanted to see how you would take it."&#xD;
The matter passed off, and they both entered Thopmson's saloon,&#xD;
where they ordered roast quail and a bottle of claret, to regale&#xD;
their delicate appetites. Having taken a view of the surrounding&#xD;
VisitOrs, they entered rather seriously oi~ the task of discussing the&#xD;
choice repast set before them. Having done ample justice to it,&#xD;
they were about leaving, when a 'lady, dressed in black silk, having&#xD;
settled her bill at the counter,.accidentaily dropped he~r porte~manb&#xD;
~ntde, and hurriedly left the saloon.&#xD;
Mr. Oldbnok picked it up, and with that gallantry~ for which he&#xD;
was always remarkable, went out in search of the lady; there wasa&#xD;
great crowd in Broadway and he could not find he?.&#xD;
Returning into the saloon, he mentiiined the circumstance to his&#xD;
friend Hammereley. The latter advised him 'to open it, to' see&#xD;
whether it would afford any clue to the name of the-owner.&#xD;
He did so, and found a letter in it,' which was addressed to Mra -&#xD;
Augustus Shrewsbury, street, New Yo~k. There ~as&#xD;
money in it also, and Jonathan putting it carefully into~his po~ket~&#xD;
said he would deliver it personally to Mrs Shrewsbtmry.&#xD;
'~Let us go there now," said Ned, "it may be a"case,' and we&#xD;
may hei'vo some fun."&#xD;
"I. don't know what you mean by a 'asse.' Why what's a&#xD;
'easel"'&#xD;
"Why, you foolish fellow, you. I mean the husband- may b~&#xD;

"Indeed, then let us go, we have nothing bOtter to do, and ean&#xD;

£ Jonathan was the first to speak, he said,'" I am really happy to&#xD;
be the means of recovering such a precious testimonial of regard.&#xD;
It must be exceedingly soothing to a wife's feelings to receive a letter&#xD;
from her' husband after such a long, absence. I almost envy you&#xD;
your happiness, madam."&#xD;
Whether it was the recovery of the letter, or the very agreeable&#xD;
manner in which' it was announced, that wrought such a wonderful&#xD;
change in Mrs Shrewsbury's feelings, it is impossible to say, but&#xD;
~she winced and smirked, and appeared so interesting, that she won&#xD;
insensibly on the hearts of her visitors.&#xD;
Mrs ShreWsbury was the wife of an officer who had distinguished&#xD;
himself in the Mexican War, and having married young, was blessed&#xD;
'~$th an only daughter, whom she had named Olarissa after her&#xD;
grandrizother, on her maternal side. The old lady died, leaving&#xD;
~larissa nothing but her name, and the' family being reduced in&#xD;
circumstances , Mr Shrewsbury emigrated to California. His wife&#xD;
was a woman of about forty years of age, possessing the renin~,nts&#xD;
of what must have been handsome features in her youth; she had&#xD;
black hair, and flaming black eyes, the certain indications of burn-&#xD;
i~g passion, which must have reduced her to a cinder. It was a&#xD;
wonder how ~he~oould have so long withstood her husband's absence,&#xD;
*tid froin~ tli~ regret which she manifested at his departure from hei,&#xD;
*be must have felt it a great deal.&#xD;
She ~piAogized to the gentlemen for Clarissa's unavoidable&#xD;
#b~ence. but begged them to believe that she would always be grate-&#xD;
f~il to. thorn for their kindness, and would be happy to cultivate their&#xD;
~quaintance.&#xD;
Mr Oldbuok looked at Mi~ Hammerslcy, and Mr Hamnrersley at&#xD;
~ )~r Oldbuok, and both cast their eyes in turn on the '~ widow," who&#xD;
was waiting to hear what they would say.&#xD;
~, Ned, who was always ~ready for a "venture," remarked, "L )e-&#xD;
hove, Oldbuok, we have no particular engagement this evening,&#xD;
I~ve we ?"&#xD;
"None, whatever, Hammersley, as 1 know of."&#xD;
~" Then," replied the other, "we might come round this even-&#xD;
- "I shall be delighted to see you, gentlemen; come early, if. you&#xD;
pl~ase."&#xD;
"We shall do so with pleasure, madam," and they took leave of&#xD;
~rs Augustus Slirewsbury.&#xD;
~~Ont~heir4 way home, Ned revelled' in the delight of the, enjoyment&#xD;
ii. shcul4 4erivo from the lady's company. "Oldbixok," said he,&#xD;
~.$hese C~li(ornia widows are a much persecuted race of beings;&#xD;
Al~y're neglected 1by their h~isbands, and meet yviill but little sym-&#xD;
01hy from their friends. I pity, the poor forlorn creatures, who&#xD;
*jligo4~o ~oget~~ years ~ni £sii~glo I4essedness, wh&amp;amp;A t~hey&#xD;
might have their husbands with them."&#xD;
&#xD;
IN 'Sl~ARCH.OF A WIFI~&#xD;
- "It's a sad state," said Jonathan, "to bejn."&#xD;
*" Yes, and that's the reason," rejoined Ned, "why I'm more par-&#xD;
ticular in my attentions to those ladies whose husbands have left&#xD;
thorn," at the same time nudging his friend under the arm.&#xD;
"It's a settled thing, then," said Oldbuck, "that your addresses&#xD;
will be paid to the widow, and mine to the daughter."&#xD;
"Very well," said Ned, "I'm pleased with the bargain."&#xD;
Ned Hammersley was one of those young men of the town whose&#xD;
company must have been very dangerous to young ladies or Califor.&#xD;
nia widows. His father died when he was young, leaving him .a&#xD;
handsome fortune, and with a disposition to use it freely. He was&#xD;
about thirty-five tears of age, of a good figure, rather dark corn.&#xD;
plexion, 'but with a manly face and forehead that was exceedingly&#xD;
pleasing. He had dark hair and dark eyes, which sparkled almost&#xD;
as much as those of the gay widow's herself, and when they looked&#xD;
at each other, it was impossible to say which werw~ the most corn.&#xD;
'bustible.&#xD;
The two gay row, intent on an evening's amusement, repaired&#xD;
-at the appointed hour to the residence in -~- street. Of course,&#xD;
on this occasion, they found Clarissa at home, and bin Oldbuck's&#xD;
eyes, no one appeared more lovely. She was twenty years of age,&#xD;
.f a slight but graceful figure, and as for the face, it con~bined all&#xD;
'the varied attractions of a 'perfect Hobe. She had dark hair and&#xD;
dark eyes, like her mother's, a small ear and nose, a row of ivory,&#xD;
which had never been under the dentist's paw, together. with a&#xD;
mellowness in the peculiar tint of her complexion, which rendered&#xD;
4her enchanting in tIle eyes of all.&#xD;
Jonathan Oldb~ucks heart was always susceptible, but it became&#xD;
an easier conquest than ever, before the surpassing charms of the&#xD;
fair Clarissa. Whilst Ned Hammersl.y was engaged in earnest&#xD;
-eonversaticn on the sofa with Mrs Shrewabury, Jonathan's qyes&#xD;
were not large enough~ to                             I&#xD;
charms of Miss Clarissa. survey at one glance, the multip ied&#xD;
It had come to that affecting point in the conversation, when&#xD;
Mrs Shrewsbury showed Mr Ilammersley a daguerreotype of her&#xD;
husband, a display which California widows might well dispense&#xD;
with, for if the husband is found to be ugly, it only adds 8trongth&#xD;
to the ambitious hopes of the widow's admirers.&#xD;
Of course Ned Hammereley remarked what a good-looking man&#xD;
her husband was, although he could find no authority for the 8tate.&#xD;
meat in the picture itself. Mr Augustus Shrewsbury had a large&#xD;
hooked nose, which had some similarity with an elephant's tusk,&#xD;
and goggle eyes, which, if they could hayc revolved i~ the pi9tnre,&#xD;
would have given him a more natural appearance. Ned thought4 to&#xD;
himself what an ugly looking mortal 'this fellow is, and wondered&#xD;
ho~ 'he had ~aptivated the heart of the engaging Mrs Shrewebtiry..&#xD;
"The oonvqrsation was on various 'a~bjects, and very entertaining.&#xD;

Canadians, who could neither read nor write. Qf purse the W~&#xD;
little correspondence, and had it not been for the anniia.l stip~4 fron~&#xD;
the department, he would not have been able to live. As itwa&#xD;
he had left his wife with one hundred dollars a year to sppp~rt har..1&#xD;
self and sb~ children, az~d he himself had driven an ox team ac~rc~z&#xD;
the plains ~o work his way out to the land of promise, The ps~or&#xD;
fellow had not been successful in gold-digging, a~d he told me he hs4&#xD;
met with nothing but disappointments since he had bee~ here. ~&#xD;
instance, he was at work for some time on a spot whic~i was Ukely~'&#xD;
to yield him a good return, when one night his piok-~e s~d shoyeJ~&#xD;
rocker, tin pans, and. everything were taken away, leavii~g his' rigi~~&#xD;
to the ground which he had "prospected" in dispute, for' the follow&amp;amp;&#xD;
ing morning he found men busy at work on his ow'n property.&#xD;
Here it is not as it is elsewhere, the laws of meum and tuum' are&#xD;
not much respected, and whoever is strongest has the kqst. rigI~t. On&#xD;
another occasion his hopes were doomed to bitter ~pj~pintmez~&#xD;

"Really," said Ned Hammersley, "you must excuse my friend&#xD;
here, for he has a vary singular mode of expressing himself, (at the&#xD;
same time giving a glance to Jonathan which he did not at all like&#xD;
'he has learnt some nautical expressions which are not very polite."&#xD;
Mrs Shrewsbury continued, and it turned out to be all "moon-&#xD;

" Now Hamrnersley," said Jonathan, "I don't see much differ-&#xD;

Ned rejoined) "it was you who perplexed her."&#xD;
"It was you," said Jonathan, and Mrs Shrewsbury intervened by&#xD;
begging of them to 'let her finish the reading of the letter.&#xD;
The widow continued, "'I have heard other instances of bitter&#xD;
and cruel disappointments, but' so far I have met with none myself,&#xD;
and hope to return in two or three years, my beloved, (here Mrs&#xD;
Augustus Shrewsbury heaved another deep sigh, which seemed to&#xD;
come up from the very profundity of her bosom) and spend the re.&#xD;
mainder of my life with you. I send you a draft in this lette~ for&#xD;

tre to be seen lawyers turned into laborers, doctors into drivers,.&#xD;
parsons into ploughmen, and a complete metamorphosis of all trades,.&#xD;
ooeu~ations and piofessions. It is surprising to what shifts ~nen.&#xD;
will turn, when they are driven to necessity. I saw Mr B.-.., the&#xD;
town clerk of S.-..-., peeling potatoes the other day, having been&#xD;
transformed during his sojourn in this land of promise, from a clerk&#xD;
into a cook. The only want we experience in this country is that&#xD;
of woman, '.happy woman,' for I can assure you the cooking is&#xD;
horrible, and we experience much trouble on that account. Were&#xD;
you here, I think I could enjoy a pate de fois gras, or a fat leg of&#xD;
* mutton."&#xD;
(Here Ned Hammersley looked at Jonathan Old buck, and both.&#xD;
looked at Mrs Shrewsbury, who was so intent on her husband's&#xD;
letter, that she did not notice them.)&#xD;
The widow proceeded with other matters in Mr Augustus ~hrews~&#xD;
bury's letter, which were not of very great interest, but she read it&#xD;
to the end, which was concluded in these affectionate terms&#xD;
"Your faithful husband, till death,&#xD;
A. SHREWSBURY."&#xD;
Time had waxed on with the reading of this letter, and it was&#xD;
past eleven o'clock, when Ned' Harnmersley having given a rather&#xD;
tight squeeze of the hand to Mrs~ Shrewsbury, and Jonathan having,&#xD;

THE agreeable relations subsisting between the Shrewsbury's and&#xD;
their new friends had continued for aboiit ten days, during which&#xD;
time Jonathan Oldbuck and his friend Ned Hammersicy had reaped&#xD;
rich rewards from the overflowing gratitude of the gay widow and&#xD;
her daughter for the small favors which their friends had conferred&#xD;
on them, such as bringing them to the Bowery and the An1phitheatr~,&#xD;
slight donations, &amp;amp;c., when Mr Oldbuck with a face elongated as&#xD;
long as his arm, and Ned Hammersley with a sigh, which he could&#xD;
Dot repress, announced to them their intention of proceeding for a&#xD;
few days to Cincinnati on business, which required their immediate&#xD;
attention. They would not be long absent, f~r matters of importance&#xD;
would necessitate their return to the city by the beginning of the&#xD;
following week.. They had come for the purpose of bidding Mrs&#xD;
Shrewsbury' and her (laughter adieu, and when they made the an~&#xD;
nouncement, all wore sorrowful countenances, but Mrs Shrewsbury'~&#xD;
was the saddest of all. Her face was generally remarkable for' a.&#xD;
slight pallor, but on this occasion when she heard the sad news, it&#xD;
became so pale, that Ned Hammersley almost pitied her distress.&#xD;
"And will you be so long away ?" asked the gay widow, "bo&amp;amp;&#xD;
Olarissa and myself will miss you very much. I never shall forget,&#xD;
indeed I sha'nt, 'that delightful walk we took the other night, whem&#xD;
Clarissa. and Mr Oldbuck left us to go to the saloon.~~&#xD;
"Why did you remain so long, Olarissa'? You were away at&#xD;
least an hour."&#xD;
Olarissa, said, "that Mr Oldbuck persuaded her to go into an io~-~&#xD;
cream saloon, where they remained for a short time, that she didn't&#xD;
like to do so, but as Mr Oldbuck told her, that her mother was in&#xD;
good hands, she finally consented."&#xD;
"I never enjoyed myself so much in my life," said Mrs ~hriwa..-&#xD;
bury, 'giving rather an interesting look to her friend Ned Ham-&#xD;
mersley, and he looking as innocent as a lamb.&#xD;

&#xD;
hUed with the choicest lion bons and mottoes, and I have been amus.&#xD;
nag myself for the last few days in reading them, and trying to find.&#xD;
out their meaning. Some of them are very ambiguous, indeed; and&#xD;
I think our poets might apply their wits to better purposes than&#xD;
writing such trash." Ol~rissa was rather nettled, which Mr&#xD;
JonathanOldbuck, her admirer, did not fail to observe, and he&#xD;
began muttering an apology for having given them to her. His&#xD;
face became as red' as fire; and in his excitement his spectacles were&#xD;
nearly falling off his nose.&#xD;
"Indeed," said he, "of course you cannot belieVe I knew what&#xD;
7was on the mottoes, or otherwise I should certainly not have&#xD;
9ffeflded my fair Clarissa's delicate taste by giving them to her."&#xD;
"I perfectly excuse you," said Clarissa, at the same tim~bLush-&#xD;
ing up to her eyes.&#xD;
After a rather protracted interview, the gentlemen got up to leave,&#xD;
t~ed Hammersley hanging most lovingly over the fair Angelina,&#xD;
and Jonathan Oldbuok looking most desperately into Clarissa's&#xD;
black eyes.&#xD;
They were loathe to part, but at length they tore themselves&#xD;
away, after heaving a bushel of sighs, and promising not to forget&#xD;
each other during their absence.&#xD;
The door had been shut for a few moments, when Mrs Shrews&#xD;
bury forgot something, which she ought to have said to Mr Ham&#xD;
mersicy, and the latter having heard the door open, went back to&#xD;
see \her. Whilst he was in the hall, she whispered something in&#xD;
his ear, as he held his arm half-way round her waist, ~nd they then&#xD;
separated.&#xD;
Railway travelling affords sufficient time for thought and reflec.~&#xD;
tion, in fact, one's thoughts are often the only companions one has&#xD;
on a long journey. Ned Hammersley reviewed the scenes of the&#xD;
last few days, he thought of the folly of men in leaving their wives&#xD;
for so long a period, and of the frailty of women, and attributed the&#xD;
numerouss divorces and elopements, whioh had come to his knowl-&#xD;
adge to one cause or t~ie other, or perhaps to both. He thought,&#xD;
however, that men were most to blame, for knowing how weak and&#xD;
fragile is the female sex, generally, they require some support from&#xD;
~ husbands or lovers. The human frame is weak, but human passion&#xD;
is strong, and the / tenement, which holds it, is like a boiling&#xD;
cauldron, which, when too much fire is applied, it runs the risk of&#xD;
~being totally consumed. Woman's heart is indeed like a sapling,&#xD;
full of strength and elasticity, but liable to be broken by the&#xD;
slightest gale of adversity. It is a wonder then, that men can be&#xD;
.~sp cruel as to leave their ~ives for so long a~ time, pining away in&#xD;
that state of desolation they see around them, after having enjoyed&#xD;
the tender care of loving husbands. As for Mrs Shrewsbury, thought&#xD;
'~ed Harnmersley, she was a pattern of virtue and morality. I4~&#xD;
is true, she was at that time of life, when passion was about to ebb&#xD;
&#xD;
:rat~.er than flow, but she still had a few nwre yeara loft to her, in&#xD;
which she. could indulge in the infirmities~ of her nature. What an&#xD;
~eye, thought Ned, it sparkled, like a flame from the purest ant/ira.&#xD;
cite, and kindled emotions, which it was hard to repres.~ It is&#xD;
well I lett~ said he to himself, or IL might have been the very&#xD;
innocent means of severing a marriage knot, which I believe was&#xD;
once tied pretty closely; but which had become rather loose of late&#xD;
by the long absence of her husband.&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck's thoughts were directed in another channel,&#xD;
the course of his true love had run smooth enough, as long as ho&#xD;
indulged Miss Clarissa with tickets to the theatre or chocolate&#xD;
bon bons. This was the summum bonumm of her fond desires, and&#xD;
whilst his generosity lasted, she had no objection to lavish a few&#xD;
small favors on him, but whether she ever entertained any serious&#xD;
thoughts of a closer connexion than that of friendship, time alone&#xD;
could tell. Herattenti~ns to Mr Oldbuck were not, however, with-&#xD;
out their effect on his ,m~ind. He fancied she was extremely devoted&#xD;
to him, and conned over, whilst, he was in the rail ears, the many&#xD;
trifling indications she had shown of her love and regard for him.&#xD;
Mr Oldbudk was a man of inordinate vanity, he thought his ap..&#xD;
pearance betokened a person, who would not have to wait long,&#xD;
whilst knocking for admission into a fair lady's heart. In his own&#xD;
opinion, his charms were irresistible, and he attributed his forrAer&#xD;
failures more to the want of appreciation amongst the fair sex, than&#xD;
t~ any defect of his own. For the future, said he to himself, I shall&#xD;
not wait to batter down the out-works, but shall storm the citadel&#xD;
itself. At the first shock it must yield before the power which is&#xD;
brought to bear against it.&#xD;
"Clarissa. Oh! the charming Clarissa, on my return from C~za-&#xD;
~cinnati, I shall take you to my arms, and we shall live to&#xD;
happily !".                                        getherso&#xD;
Such were his vain imaginings; he had again erected a castle in.&#xD;
the air, in which his fair Clarissa was to be the guardian angel, and&#xD;
he wpuld make the proposition to her as soon as he returned to&#xD;
the city.&#xD;
The travellers indulged in these fond aspirations, which served to&#xD;
while away the time on their journey, but the shades of night&#xD;
having intervened, they fell into a quiet repose, until the arrival of&#xD;
the cars in the Queen City.&#xD;
On the following morning, they found themselves comfortably&#xD;
~setthid at the "Burnet," where they regaled themselves for.a few&#xD;
days on the choice fare which "min6 host," set before ihem. It&#xD;
was approaching the first of August, tI&amp;amp;e anniversary of that day, on&#xD;
which the sons of Africa were set free in the West India Islands,&#xD;
and their bretkren in Cincinnati were to keep up a jubilee on the&#xD;
occtision with more than usual sp~rit.&#xD;
The Programme had been published, a few day~s before. The&#xD;
&#xD;

procession was to move ~from the corner of Broadway and sixth,&#xD;
which was in the proximity of the quarter, inhabited by the colored&#xD;
race. Great were the doings on this memorable occasion, Dinah&#xD;
put era her neatest apron and most gaudy shawl, whilst the black&#xD;
barber of Race Street polished his boots to make them appear as&#xD;
shining as his face. The pinch-beck watch chain had been washed&#xD;
~with soap, until it almost shined like gold, and CujJee looked as if&#xD;
he cot~Id enchant all the fair! ladies he met with, and point his&#xD;
arrows at their hearts. Fred Douglass was 'spected, to make a&#xD;
speech, 4~hich would astonish the whites.&#xD;
"Dinah," said Cuft'ee, "the words tumble out of his mouth like&#xD;
'hot buck-wheat cakes out of Aunt Sally's pan, he's a regular rolling&#xD;
mill, he never tires,' and he goes on and on, until he has nothing&#xD;
more left."&#xD;
"Ah !" said Dinah, "you're only joking, sure the great 'Postle&#xD;
of Liberty and Champion of the Colored people's rights' stops te&#xD;
take breath, he can't speak for ever without taking time to think."&#xD;
"Now, Dinah, dear, I tell you what, he speaks first, and thinks&#xD;
arter'wards, he's' an ,extraordinary fellerr, and you'll open your eyes&#xD;
when you sees him."&#xD;
"Now, Cuffee, you don't say so," and Dinah went &amp;amp;way to tell&#xD;
Betsy what she had heard.&#xD;
This was pretty much the substance of what was said amongst&#xD;
the dense masses of the coal-colored gentry of Cincinnati on jubilee&#xD;
day. At length three or four carriages arrived, conveying the&#xD;
choicest specimens of black humanity to the starting point of the&#xD;
'procession, but on looking through the windows of the vehicles,&#xD;
Jonathan observed several lighter shades of the "human form&#xD;
divine," he stopped to gaze, and wondered if that nice young lady,&#xD;
~with her long flowing black curls, and delicate complexion wa~s&#xD;
going to the feast, in company with that black man.&#xD;
Ned said, "be quiet, Oldbuck; it may be his wife or daughter,&#xD;
and if the niggers overhear you, they may be offended."&#xD;
"Hammersley," said Jonathan, "I don't want to be humbugged,;&#xD;
and I tell you what, that girl is a white girl, and she has no right&#xD;
to be seated alongside of that big black Aigger."&#xD;
"Hold your tongue, Jonathan, or, I'll leave you; the colored&#xD;
raoe are not more sensitive on any point than on that of their color,&#xD;
and they don't like to be called niggers, I can assure you. If you&#xD;
oorne with me to the"' meeting which is only a couple of miles frora~&#xD;
the city, I'll show you a sight which you never before have wit-&#xD;
nesseci. That girl'in the carriage is not a white girl, she has Africau&#xD;
blood in her, but the streani has poured through so many channels&#xD;
since it left its fountain, that it has assumed another color on the-&#xD;
passage."&#xD;
Carriages continued to arrive, bands of music played swe.t-&#xD;
s~ielodies, flags were flying, and corps of black "United Ameri-~&#xD;
&#xD;
N SEARCH OF A WIFE.&#xD;
cans," with no other contrast but the white aprons they wore, joined&#xD;
in the procession. It was quite an animated scene, and the city&#xD;
seemed fer the day to be so much given up to the blacks, that one&#xD;
might have thought he, was sojourning in the dominions of King&#xD;
Faustin, rather than under the mild sway of President Fillmore.&#xD;
"This is a great sight," said Jonathan.&#xD;
"Yes," said Ned; ~" and I am glad to see it, for in this land of~&#xD;
liberty, men of all classes, creeds, and colors, should enjoy'the most&#xD;
perfect equality, and although I do not believe that the negro race&#xD;
are either socially or physically our equals, yet, in a political point&#xD;
of view, they have a fair claim to equal rights."&#xD;
"This is a topic, Ned, on which I don't like to speak, it had better&#xD;
be left alone. Let every man mind his own business, and not attend&#xD;
to that of others, the world would jog on a little smoother."&#xD;
Oldbuck and Hammersley took the cars which brought them to&#xD;
the place of meeting. It was situated on a rising ground, from&#xD;
which there was a full view of the Ohio; with the neatly decorated -&#xD;
tents, from which flags were flying, the martial music which was&#xD;
heard, and the gay dresses of the colored ladies, who were there in&#xD;
numbers, it was an enlivening scene, and one which would remaiii&#xD;
impressed on the memory for some time. The locality which was&#xD;
selected, was agreeable in the extreme, the wildness of the scenery&#xD;
and the sylvan appearance of the green sward, on which the ladies&#xD;
were to dance, were in striking contrast with ~he view of th~&#xD;
distant cupolas and church spires of the Queen City, and the gaily&#xD;
painted steamers, as they were stemtning their way down the&#xD;
Ohio. Everything betokened ~n afternoon and evening's amusement,&#xD;
and both Ned and Jona~than were delighted at the prospect.&#xD;
A stand had been erected for the speakers, and the motley group&#xD;
surrounded it in the anxious expectation of hearing the oratiox~s.&#xD;
It was a curious spectacle to ~c: There was the woolly-headed&#xD;
"nigger," who looked as if he had just made his escape from&#xD;
Africa, the mulatto, the quadroon, and the mustafina, they wete 6f&#xD;
all grades, shades, and tints, and it would have taken quite a c~rrn-&#xD;
noisseur in the varieties of the African race to have pronounced what&#xD;
class each belonged to.&#xD;
The "Postle of Liberty and Champion of the colored peoj~les~&#xD;
rights," was not there, but there were other speakers from at home ~&#xD;
and abroad,' there were freemen and bondsmen, and pretty little&#xD;
bondswomen too, who had obtained their masters' or mistress's leave&#xD;
to come and see the great spectacle on jubilee day.&#xD;
There was one in particular who struck Oldbuck's attention'frouL&#xD;
her great beauty. Her name was BelIb. Hall, and she came fror~&#xD;
Covington, Kentucky. There were but few traces left of A~frioan&#xD;
origin in that girl; she had light hair and blue eyes, and her oem&#xD;
plexion yielded not in whiteness to P~rian marble; her figure was~&#xD;

as light ~d airy ~s a fawn,, and her vwaQity B4 rw11hKi4i~essjndi~&#xD;
oated'that she' did not feel her eonditi9a as a slave.&#xD;
In answer to an inquiry, which Oldbuck rn&amp;amp;de. to one o.~ the&#xD;
-negroes, he heard that she was, the property of an old w~n~a~z in&#xD;
Kentueky,~who treated her with as much kindness as if she were&#xD;
'ber child, and who, it was supposed, would give her her freedom;&#xD;
~pnd leave her a large property at her death.&#xD;
* Jonathan bristled up like a. porcupine at the sight of so much&#xD;
loveliness in such an assembly, and it was with difficulty his friend,&#xD;
I{x1 Harnmersley, could restrain him from rendering homage on the&#xD;
spot to her, who might have been justly denominated the "Q..ueea&#xD;
of Be~u~ty" at the feast. He became quiet impetuous, and like a&#xD;
1'nll.bloor.led steed, that wished to 'escape from, harness, tried to tear&#xD;
himself away from his friend Hammersley, and repair tp tue si4e' of&#xD;
the lovely slave.&#xD;
"Oldbuok, what are you about ?" said NecL "IDo you forget&#xD;
Clarissa, already ?"&#xD;
This name operated as a charm, or rather it hada p~ogative in-&#xD;
~Iuenoe, over the min&amp;amp; of the ardent lover, which preventedhim&#xD;
'from breaking his vows of constancy to the adorable ol~ject of his&#xD;
love,~the guardian angel in that sweet mansion in -~ street.&#xD;
U~e managed to control that overflowing passion which curdled his&#xD;
~lopd, and kept him in a ~state of excitement during the whole of&#xD;
the evening, but he now and then, c9uld not restrain himself from&#xD;
castingg a. few sheeps' eyes in the direction where Bella. I{all was&#xD;
sitting, and watching 'her movements with anxiety.&#xD;
It was approaching towards sunset, and the scene became even&#xD;
more animated. Carriages continued to arrive, setting down some&#xD;
of the most fashionable scions of aristocracy in negrodom. Maria&#xD;
Seacoal and Harriet Ritchie, came in the same carriage with Peter&#xD;
'L*room and 6~-eorge ~orgle, William Smart accompanied ]~etsy&#xD;
'Palmer and Mary Ann TownsWind. All tha.t was lovely amongst&#xD;
'the colored "gemmen" and ladies of the Qneen City, congregated&#xD;
*on the spot to celebrate the anniversary of the emancipation of their&#xD;
f~dlow 'countrymen in the British West India Islands. It was a&#xD;
cheeringg spectacle to behold, but the dance was the most amusing&#xD;
part of all.&#xD;
Mr Charles Price 'with his face shining like ivory-black, and his&#xD;
ouxly hair, which needed not the barber's tongs to pat it in order,&#xD;
but which derived additional lustre from a quantity of "Maoass4r"&#xD;
he had poured over it, was the type of his class on this occasion;&#xD;
he wore a black coat and pants, a richly variegated vest, in whi~h&#xD;
~ora~ige and scarlet were the predominating colors, aud a scarf, which&#xD;
for originality and beauty, could not be surpassed, it had a rich&#xD;
fringe at both ends, which hung so gracefully over the vest, white&#xD;
'kids and patent leather boots completed the costume, which must&#xD;
have made him quite captivating in the eyes of his sable corn-&#xD;

ideal and personification of all that was fashionable in negi~-.&#xD;
cracy.&#xD;
Su~annah Leake did knot yield in point of female attractions to'&#xD;
any of her sex. What Charles Price was amongst the men, sh~&#xD;
was amongst the w~men. When she alighted from her carriage all&#xD;
eyes were set upon her; she wore a light blue muslin, with a pro...&#xD;
fusion of jewelry, part of which she concealed by a rich lace scarf,,&#xD;
her hair was tastefully arranged with blue rosettes, which afforded&#xD;
a pleasing contrast with the jet black wool that was separated&#xD;
neatly over the forehead, and brushed back so smoothly that one&#xD;
could hardly distinguish the curls! She wore short sleeves, and&#xD;
her dress was low..neoked, displaying the admirable symmetry of a~&#xD;
fine pair of shoulders and large fat arms. She put on all the aira&#xD;
imaginable, and carrying a colored paper fan in her hand, almost as&#xD;
large as a windsail, she never appeared more graceful or lovely in&#xD;
the eyes of 'her admirers.&#xD;
There was the usual quantity of stout "niggers" and f&amp;amp;t )~urly&#xD;
negresses, making up the crowd, and adding variety to the scene&#xD;
The ladies were seated on rows of long benche~, which were pro~&#xD;
vided for the occasion, and when the band struck up the enlivening&#xD;
air of a cotillion, it was an amusing sight to see Mr Sam Mar-&#xD;
shall soliciting the hand of Miss Susan Crow in the dance. It was;&#xD;
still more amusing to see them dance.&#xD;
Jonathan envied Mr Charles Price as he gracefully bent over the&#xD;
pretty Bella Hall, and brought her to her position in the cotillion,.&#xD;
he said-&#xD;
"Ned, I should like to be in that nigger's place, and I shall asIc&#xD;
her to dance the next cotillion with me."&#xD;
"IDo you want to disgrace yourself?" said Ned. "Why, if if&#xD;
were known in New York, the very boys would cry out, 'that man,&#xD;
Oidbuok, danced with, a nigger,' and you would be shunned and&#xD;
despised by all respectable society. Even Clarissa wouldn't speak&#xD;
to you again, and then what would you do ?"&#xD;
"Let us go away, then," said Oldbuck, for I don't like to see&#xD;
that beautiful girl handled about so rudely by those rough-looking-&#xD;
uiggers.~~&#xD;
"Indeed I shan't," said Ned; "are you such a fool that yon&#xD;
can't remain here' as a quiet spectator, and see what is going on,&#xD;
without wishing to out up your capers and dance with the&#xD;
niggers ?"&#xD;
Mr Oldbuck did not approve of his friend Hammersley's philoso-.&#xD;
pity, and seemed' to be in a state of doubt during the remainder or&#xD;
the evening. His was a very susceptible nature, it was like wat&#xD;

THEY remained a few days in Cincinnati, during which n&#xD;
interesting occurred, and becoming cnnuye of the dullness&#xD;
Queen City, they went to the rail-road station where the h&#xD;
and snorting locomotive was ready to whirl them along to&#xD;
abode. In thirty-six hours they found themselves within b&#xD;
distance of the objects of their love; and having arranged&#xD;
toilets, they hastened to make known their arrival to Mrs S~&#xD;
bury and her daughter. Lovers take precedence of parent&#xD;
other relations, and neither Old buck nor Hammersley suffered&#xD;
filial duties to interfere with their feelings for the objects ol&#xD;
affection.&#xD;
Leaving their valises in a place of safety, they got into a -&#xD;
street stage, and were leisurely driven up Broadway. 01&#xD;
seemed impatient, and cried out once or twice to the dri&#xD;
increase the spe&amp;amp;vJ of hisr horses, but the louder he cried the ~&#xD;
he went, and it was some time before they reached the p0&#xD;

forgetting to pay the man his fare, they wore wrapt up in at&#xD;
at the effect their arrival would have on Mrs Shrewsbury an&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
When their names were ani~ouncod at the door, light foo&#xD;
were heard hurriedly going upstairs, and Jonathan and his&#xD;
were ushered into the parlor, where the4y waited for some&#xD;
before the ladies made their appearance.&#xD;
The fair Angelina came into the room exuberant of jo~&#xD;

tedious to her during his absence, that she really did not know what&#xD;
to do. As f&amp;amp; Clarissa, looking at Mr Oldbnck, I can assure you&#xD;
she missed all the concerts and theatres you took her to, and she.&#xD;
says she has not had a stick of candy! since you left.&#xD;
Clarissa came into the room to speak for herself, and if Mrs&#xD;
Shrewsbury's joy was excessive at meeting with Mr Harnmersley,.&#xD;
Mr 'Oldbuok's was equally immoderate at seeing the fair Clarissa.&#xD;
An hour passed off very agreeably between the re-united party, and&#xD;
nothing would have occurred to mar Mr *Oidbuck's pleasure on the~&#xD;
occasion, but an allusion~, which his friend. Ned indiscreetly made,&#xD;
to "the love adyent~re at the jubilee.&#xD;

Ned Hammersley called at seven for his friend Oldbuck, and they&#xD;
both proceeded to street. On theii~ way there, Ned said that&#xD;
the "rappers" had arrived in town, and that he should' like to take&#xD;
Mrs Shrewsbury 'and her daughter to see, them.&#xD;
Mr Oldbuck agreed to the proposition; and a short time after&#xD;
their arrival at Mrs Shrewsbury's, the ladies were habited in 'theit&#xD;
bonnets and shawls to ~go 'and hear what the spirits had to say. In&#xD;
rather a large hail in -~- street, there was a "social circle" sitting&#xD;
round a black walnut table. The company consisted of three ladies&#xD;
and two gentlemen, there being but one medium, present, and she&#xD;
was a fe!nale, for it seems the spirits have a peculiar taste for com-&#xD;
inunicating with their friends through the gentler sex, ~ sort of&#xD;
moral infirmity in which they share with other mortals. To judge&#xD;
of the character of the audience from the outward signs of in-&#xD;
tellectuality they manifested, one would not have had a very high&#xD;
opinion of their mental attainments, but they made up in credulity&#xD;
what they lacked in judgrr.ient, for they were deeply intent on every&#xD;
demonstration of spiritual agency.&#xD;
Whether it~ was from Mr Oldbuck's grotesquee appearance, or&#xD;
from his close proximity to the medium, he was the first to attract&#xD;
her notice, and she asked him whether he had any relations&#xD;
or friends in the other world, with whom he desired to communi-&#xD;
cate?&#xD;
Jonathan replied that he had; but his frequent glances at&#xD;
the other side of the table, where Miss Olarissa was seated, in-&#xD;
dicated that he would ' sooner commune with~ beings below than&#xD;
above.&#xD;
The medium handc4 him a paper on which. he was to write seve-&#xD;
ral names, and amongst them the name of the relative with whom&#xD;
he desired to communicate. The spirit would intimate his readi-&#xD;
ness to hold a communication, by giving three raps wheir he carrie&#xD;
to the name of his relative, and but one for all the others.&#xD;
Jonathan began with pencil and paper in hand, and having passed&#xD;
over several names, which he marked, when he came to his father's,&#xD;
of course he showed a little trepidation, which th'e keen eye of&#xD;
the fair medium did not fail to observe, and the spirit gave three&#xD;
raps.&#xD;
Jonathan leapt from the table, an~d' in the height of his credulity,&#xD;
said, "she was the devil." He afterwards begged pardon fo~ the&#xD;
impolite expression he had used, but expressed his intention 'to&#xD;
examine the table. After a few exciamatiokis from some of th.&#xD;
young ladies, who were present, how wonderful it was, he pro-&#xD;
ceeded with the search. He found no hidden springs, nor arty crack&#xD;
or crevice to elucidate the mystery, for a mystery it was to' 'him,&#xD;
how that tall creature, who was called a medium, could know bi~&#xD;

-tfather's name. It was not without a little' compunction, that ha&#xD;
consented to seat himself again at the table, which having done, he&#xD;
was desired to say, whether he wished to hold any tdther coxnmu-&#xD;
v~iieation with the spirit?'&#xD;
"Mr Oldbuck was by no means a brave man, and his face rather&#xD;
blanched, as the thought flashed across his mind, that he was hold-&#xD;
ing communication with the spiritual world. He begged to be&#xD;
excused, and remarked, "that he seemed.to be taking up too much&#xD;
of the spirits' time, that there were other persons in the room, who&#xD;
might wish to communicate." They all said, "go on with ]~r&#xD;
Old buck," and in spite of his wishes to the eputrary, the spirit again&#xD;
~found, him with pencil and paper in hand, ready to hold further&#xD;
Jutercourse. Mr Oldbnck expressed his wish, that the communicant&#xD;
~in the ether. world should tell him in what relation he sto~kl towards&#xD;
.liim, where he died, and how he was, ~t present?&#xD;
Having, gone through the same process of writing, all the different&#xD;
'~degrees of relationship~ and several names of* cities and towns, the&#xD;
spirit 'was again to signify his assent to the truth, by giving the&#xD;
~same number of raps as ho did ~on the first 'occasion.&#xD;
Jonathan proceeded boldly to the task, ahd when he came. to the&#xD;
~word "father," three distinct raps were again heard~ On this ~cca.&#xD;
i~ionhe did not wait~ to, comrngnjcate any further with the spirit,&#xD;
~J~nt expressed his determination to leave. 'He teaUy was alarmed!&#xD;
'p~ud he stared with his large goggle eyes at Miss Clarissa, until she&#xD;
did not know what to make of him.&#xD;
~Time passed on, whilst the spirits were holding communications&#xD;
,with the other persons in the room, in some of which they gave&#xD;
~qorrect answers to the questions,. that were put to them, ,a~rd ig&#xD;
others they did not, but they left a strong impression on the minds&#xD;
~f all, that they were knowingg un's at least, and on none more so&#xD;
,~than on Mr Jonathan Oldbuck, who' indulged, in several exelama-&#xD;
,~tions of astonishment, "at the wonderful spirit of the age."&#xD;
As for his' friend Ned Hammersley, he was too much ~taken up&#xD;
with corporeal substances, to think a~ great deal about the spirit&#xD;
'world,, and Clarissa was an~dous, to leave, as~ she thought Mr Old-&#xD;
,buck might treat her to bon bons on his way home.~&#xD;
~The ev~iiug's walk to 'Mrs Shrewsbury's mansion jn -&#xD;

passed off pretty much as the othe# occasion, on which they had&#xD;
the ladies to the theatre, and which had afforded Mrs&#xD;
~hrewsbnry such exquisite pleasure. Both' Mr Oldbuck and Ham-&#xD;
~nersley were assiduous in their attentions to the gay widow and'her&#xD;

return in the evening," and. saying so, he bid her adieu, and left.&#xD;
lie had hardly closed the door, when another loud peal of laughter&#xD;
rang through every room in the house.&#xD;
The mother shortly afterwards returned, and she had hardly time&#xD;
to take off her bonnet, before Clarissa came running into the parlor,&#xD;
and said:-&#xD;
~' Mama, what do you think, that ugly old fellow, Oldbuck, has&#xD;
been here, frightening m~ out of my wits."&#xD;
"Why, what has he done, deat ?"&#xD;
"He threw himself on ibis knees, and wouldn't leave me, uni~il I&#xD;
said I loved him. I. couldn't say so, Mama, for I hate the ugly old&#xD;
x~nonster. What impertinence, indeed, I'm sure I've never given him&#xD;
any cause to believe thati love him."&#xD;
"You accepted his candies, dear."&#xD;
"I know I did'but I'm sorry for it now~ 0 dear me, I'm so happy,.&#xD;
I did not sit for my Daguerreotype 'for him, he wanted me so much&#xD;
to do so."&#xD;
"What answer did you give him, &amp;amp;larissa ?"&#xD;
I told him you would give him my answer, this evening, and&#xD;
you can tell him, for-me, that sooner than marry him, I would go&#xD;
to my grave. I shall not come into the room, should he call here a&#xD;
hundred times, and if I meet him in the street, I shall not speak to&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Anxious as Mrs Shr~wsbury may have been to provide a suitable&#xD;
match for her daughter, she knew too well those qualities in men,&#xD;
which inspire love, not to know, that Jonathan Oldbuok possessed&#xD;
none of them. In her eyes, he was 'repulsive for his surpassing&#xD;
t~gliness, and she could not- but believe, that Clarissa labored under&#xD;
the same impression. She did not wish to offend him, bu1~ she made&#xD;
up her mind to tell him once for all, that he could have no hopes in.&#xD;
that quarter.&#xD;
Mr Oldbuck called according to appointment in the evening, he&#xD;
found Mrs Shrewebury seated alone in the parlor. She relieved him&#xD;
from the necessity of making known the object of his visit, for lie&#xD;
bad hardly been ~eated a few moments on 'the sofa alongside of her,..&#xD;
when she said&#xD;
"Mr Oldbuck, I heard from my daughter, that during my absence'&#xD;
this afternoon, you had solicited her ~nd in marriage, and she very&#xD;
properly referred you to me. Being~ her natural guardian, I think&#xD;
you might at first have expressed your intentions to me, before&#xD;
speaking with her on such a delicate subject."&#xD;
Mrs Shrewsbury was rather offended at his oversight, and she&#xD;
took good care to let him know, that she knew more ox~ the subject&#xD;
than he did. She had said nothing yet to raise or crush his hopes,&#xD;
so Mr Oldbuck remarked&#xD;
"Pardon me, madam, for having been guilty of an error, in not&#xD;
telling you first how deeply I live your daughter; I perfectly adore-&#xD;
&#xD;
IN SEARCH OF A WIFE.&#xD;
her, and she says you are to seal my happiness or misery now and&#xD;
forever."&#xD;
"I have no doubt, Mr Oldbuck, that it is a cruel alternative, but&#xD;
having conferred with my daughter on the subject, I will give you&#xD;
her answer, 'It is that she cannot marry you.'"&#xD;
Poor Jonathan Oldbuck's face relaxed in its rotundity, it oeoame&#xD;
so elongated, that it seemed as if it had gone through a rolling-mill,&#xD;
and s~ deep was his emotion, that he could hardly call up sufficient&#xD;
presence of mind to ask Mrs Shre~vsbury, what was the reason? At&#xD;
length he did so, begging of her at the same time to be candid and&#xD;
conceal nothing from him.&#xD;
The mother assured him, "that she never practiced any evasion4,&#xD;
but she would prefer his not pressing the question~"&#xD;
"Pray tell me, Oh, do, I am prepared for the worst, but if by any&#xD;
act of devotion during the remainder of my life, I could gain your&#xD;
daughter's love, I would willingly perform it."&#xD;
"It's impossible Mr Oldbuck, no act of yours could remove the&#xD;
impediment, which nature has thrown in the way."&#xD;
"What is it, do for heaven's sake tell me&#xD;
She whispered gently into his ear, you're too ugly."&#xD;
Poor Jonathan Oldbuck took his hat and left the house.&#xD;
Clarissa missed the cawfics, but it was the only loss she sustained.&#xD;
from Mr Oldbuck's absence. As for Ned Hammersley he paid visits&#xD;
occasionally at the house, and took long walks with Mrs Shrews.&#xD;
bury. She received no more letters from her husband, and wondered&#xD;
why he did not write to her. Towards spring, she pleaded indispo-&#xD;
sition, as an excuse for going to the country, leaving Clarissa in.&#xD;
charge of the house during her absence. On her return, she looked&#xD;
thinner than when she left, and her delicate state of health was the&#xD;
source of anxious solicitude to her daughter,, who wished to call in.&#xD;
a medical attendatit, a step, to which the mother was decidedly op-&#xD;
posed. Hammer~ley was unremitting in his attentions, and the&#xD;
" California widow" seemed to appreciate them as much as ever.&#xD;

-~THE BEGfl~NING OF ANOTHER INTRIGUE-MARGUERITE GERBOIS.&#xD;
PARIs, the scene of intrigues, pleasures, and. love, the great whirl.&#xD;
pd&amp;amp;I 'which swallows up innocence and youth, virtue and integrity,&#xD;
and where Vic~ lies at the bottom, which is stirred up now and tlien&#xD;
to afford variety to the scene. The city of grisett~s and blondes, of&#xD;
princesses and duchesses, and where men have most opportunity of&#xD;
'consulting their tash~s for "wine, wit, and Woman," it was decidedly&#xD;
th~ nib&#xD;
bUnk's at agreeable spot on~ earth to repair to, after Jonathan Old-&#xD;
numerous vexations' and disappointments on this side of the&#xD;
Water.&#xD;
A f~w months had elapsed since his last amours, during which&#xD;
time he had bcen devoting his leisure hours to the stndy of French,&#xD;
when one afternoon, after dinner, 'he expressed a wish to his mother&#xD;
to travel, to ~ee a' little of th~ world, which the latter readily agreed&#xD;
to, Saying that her dear departcd~husband had improved his mind so&#xD;
much by seeing so n~i'any countries', that ho had been from Noya-&#xD;
Zernbla to the Cape of'Good Rope, that he had danced with the Pin-&#xD;
landers, and Bi~n6ked pipes with the' CalVres, and 'thai his conversa-&#xD;
tion was so interesting, that he was' courted and admired by all who&#xD;
knew him.&#xD;
"Mama, why didn't you tell me so before? I'm sure that from&#xD;
having remained all my life in the little town of New Bedford, I've&#xD;
been denied many opportunities of improving my mind, and I think&#xD;
it's high time that I should L~egin to do so."&#xD;
"You're young yet, my boy; and your father did not begin to&#xD;
travel until he was older than you are."&#xD;
Jonathan appeared rather incredulous of what his mother had&#xD;
told him, particularly as he was turi~ing fifty years of age, so he&#xD;
resolved to set out on his journey without delay. His travelling&#xD;
appointments were soon arranged, and having engaged a berth in&#xD;
one of the .Uavre steamers, he bid adieu to his mother, not without&#xD;
feeling bitter regret at his separation from one who had always given&#xD;
him such good advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN SEARCH OF A WIFE.&#xD;
It was the first time that Jonathan had been at sea, and the&#xD;
weathe~ being rather tempestuous, he could not at first account for&#xD;
that peculiar sensation which he experienced; but the storm con.&#xD;
tinuing, he gave visible demonstration of what was the matter with&#xD;
him. He wa's sea'.sick, and such was the nature of the malady&#xD;
under which he labored, that the more he eat the more he found ho&#xD;
could not contain what he had eaten.&#xD;
"'Call the doctor! I'm dying, I tell you (I'm dying !" he cried&#xD;
out so lustily in the agony he experienced, that' the waiters&#xD;
looked on him with sheer pity, and whilst they were tellW~g him he&#xD;
would soon get better, he exclaimed, "I'm getting worse !~ Oh, my&#xD;
mother, my dear mother !"&#xD;
The storm lasted four days, and such was the shock to his sys.&#xD;
tem, which had not 'become enured to the incidents of a sea voyage,&#xD;
that he remained iu'bed during the rest of the passage.&#xD;
From Havre to Paris he was not long in making the journey~ and&#xD;
in less than three weeks after his departure from the empire city,&#xD;
he had taken lodgings in ~one of the numerous HoteiPgarnis hi the&#xD;
Faubourg Saint Jacques.&#xD;
Life in Paris has its pleasures and its sorrows; there is so much&#xD;
to attract the attention of a stranger as he is promenading along&#xD;
the Boulevards, or even the Citausee d'Antin, that time flies with&#xD;
the speed of an arrow. Whether, he studies human nature in the&#xD;
vicinity of the splendid mansions of the Faubourg Saint Antoine,&#xD;
or amongst the humbler dwellings of the 'Rue des Mathu#ins, at&#xD;
every step he takes he sees striking examples of wealth and poverty,&#xD;
and of virtue and vice. Human nature is the same every where,&#xD;
but in no place is it so much diversified as in the gay saloons and&#xD;
more humble places of resort of the bourgeoisie of 'Paris. We shall&#xD;
not follow our hero through all the adventures he ha~d in the gay&#xD;
capital, nor shall we stop to inquire how much he admired the ob-&#xD;
jects of 'art, which every where struck his attention, but it will be&#xD;
interesting, after the knowledge we have of his peculiar weakness&#xD;
in his relations with the fair sex; to see whether his visit to la belle&#xD;
France, contributed to give him that strength of mind which would&#xD;
render him more able to resist their temptations.&#xD;
Jonathan had learned a little French, but not sufficient to make&#xD;
himself acquainted with the art of conversation. He could parlor&#xD;
Prancais, and had gone pretty well through the past! and present!&#xD;
tense of the verb aimer (to love), but the future he had yet to learn;&#xD;
he could say, .Je vous ainze and J'ai aim6, but as for the future,&#xD;
wl~ether the word was too long for him to pronounce, or. he had not&#xD;
come to that part in the grammar, it's~ impossible to say, but he&#xD;
knew nothing about it.&#xD;
When strangers arrive in a foreign country, 'and are not ac-&#xD;
quainted with the language, the first words they find it useful t~&#xD;
know ~re those by which they asks for their food, but with Jonatham&#xD;

&#xD;
it ~was othei~wise, aud' h~ admired the perspicuity of the grammarian&#xD;
~ taught his pupils to conjugate the word airner, asthe first&#xD;
lesson in the verbs.&#xD;
At the Hotel wh~re Mr. Oldbuok resided, there was a number of&#xD;
apartments occupied by bachelors and families, none of whom were&#xD;
blessed with a superabundance of the comforts of life.' They be-&#xD;
longed chiefly to the middle classes, who found it more economical&#xD;
to live in hired lodgings than in houses of their own. There&#xD;
was one family living on the same floor as Mr Oldbuck, rather&#xD;
reduced in circumstances; they evidently appeared to be more&#xD;
respeotabte than the persons who are usually found in a second-&#xD;
rate hotel in the .Faubourg Saint Jacques. One of the little boys&#xD;
belonging to the family, was in the habit of coming into Mr Old-&#xD;
buck's room to borrow severe[ things, i~ow a little sugar, then a&#xD;
little pepper, until Jonathan began to discover that his loans, though&#xD;
not extensive, were so often repeated, that they would add a con-&#xD;
~iderable expense to his weekly ~bills. He began to remonstrate&#xD;
against his £travagance, and was ahnost' inclined to refuse&#xD;
the little fellow When he came again, but one afternoon he acci-&#xD;
dently met a young lady in the passage, who had just come out of&#xD;
'his neighbor's toom, and this event, which might be so pregnant&#xD;
with consequences, whether for weal or woe to Mr Oldbuck. made /&#xD;
him alter his intentiOn.&#xD;
The next time the little gamin came into the room to ask if he&#xD;
had same fuel to spare for their fire, ~whioh was just going out,&#xD;
Jonathan loaded him with an armful; that would supply the family&#xD;
for a week. He began ~to interrogate the young messenger, but as&#xD;
his knowledge of French did not extend to the hard words in the&#xD;
language, he had to supply them with English, making such a jar-&#xD;
gon, that n~ one could understand him.&#xD;
"Fot~&amp;amp;s padez Anglais"-the little boy shook his head.&#xD;
"Vous .know la flUe in the chambre"-he nodded affirmatively&#xD;
this time.&#xD;
Jonathan took out a big 4ictionary, and in his desire to know the&#xD;
relationship of the young lady to his youthful mes~e~1ger, went&#xD;
through the whole category from mother down to second eunsins.&#xD;
He asked-&#xD;
"Est elle your mere, sceur, tante, cousin-germaine, or petite-&#xD;
~ousine ?"&#xD;
The little boy did not understand him, so he ran oqt and brought&#xD;
his-father in ~to speak with the gentleman. The former was not&#xD;
more conversant with English than the latter was with French, so&#xD;
after seeing the difficulty in which he was placed, with that&#xD;
natural politeness, so characteristic of Frenchmen, he. bowed himself&#xD;
oi4 of the. room.&#xD;
The next day the little boy beckoned Mr. Oldbuck to follow him&#xD;
Auto his father's room, whete he was formally introduced to the&#xD;
&#xD;
i~{SEAUt~II OF A WIFE.                 85&#xD;
several members of the family, through the intervention of a young&#xD;
lady who was present, and understood a little English. The&#xD;
daughter of Oldbuok's neighbor was all smiles and cot rtesy when&#xD;
she understood that Jonathan intended to occupy the apartments&#xD;
some time longer, and therewas a general feeling of joy (lepieted&#xD;
on the countenances of all, when they heard that there was a likel~i-&#xD;
hood to have such a generous neighbor ne~ar them.&#xD;
As there were three Parisian belles in the room, and they were all&#xD;
more or less remarkable for beauty, Jonathan's heait was floating&#xD;
about on a sea of perplexity as to which he should choose. He&#xD;
wished much to have another flirtation, and as he had heard a great&#xD;
deal about intrigues and liaisons with ladies 9f the gay metropolis,&#xD;
he fancied he could trim his sails to such advantage, as to arrive at&#xD;
last at the goal of his aspirations.&#xD;
The fair interpreter was of great use to him, and as it was evi-&#xD;
dent from his limited knowledge of French,' he 'could not get along&#xD;
very well without her, he paid the most assiduous attention to' her.&#xD;
Miss Monmorand, for that was the young lady's name, who occupied&#xD;
apartments in Mr. Old buck's neighborhood, appeared rather jealous&#xD;
that Marguerite Gerbois should be more the object of his admiration&#xD;
than herself, and never 'regretted anything so much in her life, as&#xD;
her ignorance of the English language.&#xD;
The following dialogue took place between Mr. Oldbuck arid Miss&#xD;
Gerbois, in which the former's limited knowledge of' French,&#xD;
and the latter's imperfect acquaintance with English, ma~$e them&#xD;
use a phraseofogy, which was almost unintelligible to Englishmen&#xD;
or Frenchmen.&#xD;
"Ma chere, Miss," said Jonathan, "voulez vous assure Made-&#xD;
moiselle Mqnmorand, que ~e serai tres," (he hesitated, and could not&#xD;
remember the French word for "glad,") content de ~lui donner, all&#xD;
that she wanjs, no matter what it is. Xe serai always pret to serve&#xD;
young ladies who already began to understand him thoroughly,&#xD;
first chuckled, then la4hed out loud at Mr Oldbuek's devotion to&#xD;
Miss Monmorand; he did not understand what they meant, for&#xD;
whilst he thought that he had been offering them what his "hou~o&#xD;
and home" contained, they believed it was something tantamount to&#xD;
a declaration of love on his part.&#xD;
Miss Gerbois replied, "the family are very reconnoissant to you&#xD;
for all your politesse, and will be tres content a voue&#xD;
Jonathan smiled and bowed acquiescence, for he wished to culti-&#xD;
vate their acquaintance, in order to make himself more proficient in&#xD;
French. He said,&#xD;
"Mademoiselle Gerbois, will you tell Miss Lucie, that when she&#xD;
Wants some sucre (sugar) or some fen (fire) or anything else, that I&#xD;
shall tie most happy tres content to give it to her. I'll give her as&#xD;
much as she wants, indeLed I will," Jonathan Oldbuck's eyes spark-&#xD;

~tIi0se two art~icles in particular, as an exemplification of his good-&#xD;
~ic~ss.&#xD;
The ladies smiled,'and Miss Ger~oia winked at Lucie, as much as&#xD;
say, that she had a very accommodating person for her neighbor.&#xD;
Jonathan went on,&#xD;
"VouleIa~ v~us, tell Mademoiselle Lucie, that I don't know how&#xD;
to speak French comme ii faut, and that I'm afraid she rpay not&#xD;
understand me very well."&#xD;
L~ieie, here said, "J'aimerai bien a cor/tprendre l'An8'lais,"' (I&#xD;
e1~ould like very much t&amp;amp; know English), but~ Jonathan who was an&#xD;
intentlistener, when he heard her pronounce the first person singular&#xD;
of thc future tense of the verb aimer (to' love), but which was not&#xD;
used in that sense here, thought Lucie said that she loved him very&#xD;
well. And he replied, "tell her, I am tres fier, (very proud) of the&#xD;
preference she shows me."&#xD;
Lucie agaii~ found his words incomprehensible, and when Miss&#xD;
Gerbois explained them to her, became rather indignant, that he&#xD;
should' 'be so explicit in his declarations before so many persons.&#xD;
The conversation was at length brought to an end., by the diffi.~&#xD;
oulty which all seemed to experience to understand each other, but&#xD;
between Jonathan and Miss Gerbois, there arose quite an intimacy,&#xD;
and' as she and another young lady, who was with her were ahout&#xD;
leaving, Jonathan proposed to escort them home, an offer, which&#xD;
they willingly accepted.&#xD;
It was not far from the Faubourg Saint Jacques tQ the Rue de&#xD;

in his devotions at your shrine than Jor~athan Oldbnck, who wor.&#xD;
shipped'yon with a veneration, that; has never been equalled by any&#xD;
other mortal. His prayers were not propitious in the land of his&#xD;
birth, and he had travelIe~I far and wide, to see if he could make.&#xD;
any other offerings at the altar of tbi fickle god, but Ou~id appeared&#xD;
to be no friend of his, for he thwarted every effort to consummate&#xD;
)iis wishes. Whether in the humble mansion in street, or&#xD;
iu the still humbler apartments of the sewing girl, in the Rue de la&#xD;
.Z~nssardzere, there was an evil influence at work, that; foiled all&#xD;
hj~ plans, and counteracted all his efforts, to leap beyond the chasm,&#xD;
t1l~t separates the si ogle from the married state. He thought he&#xD;
w~s;doorned to disappointment, and was resolved to try once niore&#xD;
to change~ his condition. "I shall have one -more trial," said he,&#xD;
"and if I do not succeed, I shall return to America and live there&#xD;
in the quiet and seclusion of a bachelor's life. I shati trouble mysel(&#xD;
n~ longer about the fair sex, and aflow those who have neglected&#xD;
and spurned my offers, to live in ~he eonsciousrwss of the wrongs&#xD;
they' have done me, and regret how little they appreciated my per.&#xD;
BQnal charms."&#xD;
~{e returned to his lodgings, where he found the little boy waiting&#xD;
at ~his dooi,. to asI~ him to lend his mother cinq francs, and she would&#xD;
return it to him the next morning.&#xD;
This request awakened Jonathan from the reveries of love and&#xD;
~omance to the more sober realities of life, for he thought to him~&#xD;
self, that his neighbors became more extravagant in their demands,&#xD;
and that Ahey were making heavy calls on his purse. The door&#xD;
was a~j~r, and the 8ight of Lucie made him come to a decision sooner&#xD;
than he would have done, for~he took out his purse and handed the&#xD;
boy a~ flyefranc piece.&#xD;
He, h~ad not been long in the room, when the little fellow again&#xD;
entered, and asked him for the loan of some vinegar. Jonathan in&#xD;
hi ~annoyance at their frequent requests, handed him the cruet-&#xD;
stai~id, and told him to take it with him~n, thinking by that means he&#xD;
w~u1d ~et rid of at least some of their importunities.&#xD;
He little thought, that~ his highly appreciated generosity would&#xD;
ozily add new zest to their desire to get all they could out of him,&#xD;
~4 i~ was x~ot long before the fair Lucie herself came to the door as&#xD;
~ lztzmble supplicant on his bounty and benevolence.&#xD;

OW OOURTsmP-REFLEOTIONS OF JONATHAN OLDBUOK ON THE 5TA~T1t OF&#xD;
XIS ~FINAN0E5-~-U(VOOATION TO MONEY.&#xD;
OLDBUCK dreamt all night about Mademoiselle Marguerite, her&#xD;
image was never out of his thoughts. On the following morning&#xD;
he went out ,a walking in the rue de la Poissardiere, he did not&#xD;
wi~h to call 'on :Miss aerbois so soon, too much precipitation, might&#xD;
appear ridiculous, but he would at all events walk in the same&#xD;
!street and breathe* the same air as she did, for there was at least.&#xD;
'soifle satisfaction in that.&#xD;
The street was long, the houses were generally of four or flyer&#xD;
stories, and there wel'e but few porters, from whom he could mak~&#xD;
inquiry as 1~o Mrs Gerbois' residence. He was at a lots to find it oju1~,&#xD;
for although he had taken notice of the house~ all the buildings.&#xD;
were so much alike, that he might easily mistake it.&#xD;
He stopped on the steps of a house and was about knocking for&#xD;
admission, when looking up to see if he was not wrong, an&#xD;
woman opened a window in the third story and threw out a ~ail-.'&#xD;
full of dust and rubbish, which falling on Jonathan, got. through~ his&#xD;
spectacles~and almost blinded him As for his clothes, they were ~&#xD;
much bespattered With some~elimny substance, that he thought they~&#xD;
were ruined, and was almost ashamed to walk through the str~ets.&#xD;
of Paris in that dirty condition.&#xD;
This is enough for to-day, thought 'Jonathan'; I ought to be more-&#xD;
careful, as to how I note the re~id~enoe of: my friends, however, I~&#xD;
shall easily find it out to-morrow~&#xD;
On the folloWing morningJiinatlian was more careful than usual&#xD;
his toilet, took his hat and cane and proceeded in the direction ci'&#xD;
the rue de la Poissardiere. He at length found the house, whe#e'&#xD;
the ladies lived, but did not rem$friber the panioular floor, on which~&#xD;
-were their apartments. Oldbuck ascends a dark stair-case, and.&#xD;
decides on knocking at a door in the second 'story.&#xD;
An old woman in a short gown, who had ~it least four handker..-&#xD;
chiefs on her head, opened the door for Oldbuok, who asked her icr"&#xD;
.M'adame Geri.ois, that lives hero with her two nieoes.&#xD;

"It's not here, Sir."&#xD;
Jonathan did not understand her very well, but he knew they&#xD;
lived in that house.&#xD;
"What do thiy do ?" asked the old woman.&#xD;
Jonathan seemed to understand her, for he made use of the word&#xD;
~couturiere, which the old woman understood and beckoned with her&#xD;
hand that they lived up stairs.&#xD;
Jonathan. found out his mistake, for going up stairs he knocked&#xD;
at the door, which was opened by Marguerite herself. On enter~&#xD;
ing he found a young manAhe~e, w~o was in conversation with the&#xD;

Marguertte was very kind and considerate in her attentions to&#xD;
~Mr Oldbnek, and entertained him for some time with the numeroi~s&#xD;
'littIe~repartees, with which French girls are so familiar. All the&#xD;
time they were~ in conversation, the cousin, ~ho had last entered,&#xD;
appeared to be growing more impatient, and at length made a sign&#xD;
to Mr Oldbuck's belie, which she immediately understood. Beg-&#xD;
ging him to excuse her for a few moments, she followed Gustave&#xD;
(for that was his nam4 into the adjoining room, the door ~f which&#xD;
~she closed.&#xD;
Jonathan did not know what to think about it, and went to the&#xD;
window, which looked out on the yard belonging to the building,&#xD;
with his mind in a state of perplexity, oven as to the oharaoter of&#xD;
the persons with whom he ld been thrown into communication;&#xD;
but his doubts we~re dispelled by what he k~ad been able to pick up'&#xD;
in French from L~cie about her friends, the Gerbois, and the&#xD;
frank open manner of the girls themselves. He was resolved, how-&#xD;
ever, to make further inquiries about their relatives, &amp;amp;o., and&#xD;
doubted not that all his apprehensions would be removed on that&#xD;
score, by what Lucre would tell him, he even ~reproached himself&#xD;
for entertaining suspicions which might be groundless, and thought&#xD;
~at. la~st'~hat he had been doing injustice to the girls.&#xD;
)$I4rguerite remained a few minutes in, the ~ooai with ber cousin,&#xD;
and coming out, begged Mr Oldbuck to excuse her for hbr rude~&#xD;
x~esa in having left him, at the sama time assuring himthat she had&#xD;
yery pre~i~ng b~isiziess to transact with Gust~ve, wh&amp;amp; was ~oiug to&#xD;
the ~oixntry in the morning. * The latter seemedto understand the&#xD;
impoi~t of v~at Marguerite was telling Mr. Oldbuok, 'for. he smiled'&#xD;
ajid put on sueh a pleasingair, that entirely conciliated him~ 'Th~e~two&#xD;

was alone with Marguerite and the other girL&#xD;
ilad Jonathan been left with Marguerite alone, he would no doubt'&#xD;
have trie~1 to practice a little familiarity also with' the girl, bu~&#xD;
there is no saying, as his natural reserve and respect for, the' female I;&#xD;
sex wpuld forever prevent him from going beyond th~ bounds which&#xD;
courtesy prescribed. He never regretted anything so much 'in his&#xD;
life, that he' was not one of the cousins also, for the 'smack which&#xD;
~e~rge.&amp;amp; had given to the pretty little grisette, still rang in his ears,&#xD;
and he could not forget it. He did! make an attempt to take h~J.dt&#xD;
of Marguerite's hand, to admire one of th9 rings she wore, hut&#xD;
having pressed it rather too tightly, she hastily withdrew it;' giving&#xD;
him at "the same time a look which h&amp;amp; did not much like. Pcox~&#xD;
Jonathan ! the course of his true love never could ~riixt smooth, ~no&#xD;
matter how much carp he took to make it go through' a proper&#xD;

seemed to fall heedless on the ears of the little gr~settc. 'It was~&#xD;

12                JONATHAN OLDBUCK&#xD;
went on in his old way to the affections of his Parisian ac.&#xD;
quaintanee. He did not remain long after the cousins left, but~&#xD;
promised ~to 'return on the following day with Lu.~ie, to take them a~&#xD;
walking. In the 'meantime he would make further inquiries and&#xD;
ascertain all about them.&#xD;
'On his return to his lodgings, he was not ~loncr in being thrown&#xD;
'in communication with his neighbors, for scarcely an hour or tw&amp;amp;&#xD;
elapsed during the day, without they called to borrow something&#xD;
or other from their obliging friend.&#xD;
An opportunity soon presented itself, for Lucie came bounding&#xD;
into the room to ask for three centimes, which she knew Mr Oldbuck&#xD;
'would readily 'give her, as their pr~yio~s demands had been for&#xD;
fr&amp;amp;ncs ' This put Jonathan in a g~1 humor, for their loans were&#xD;
becoming more moderate, and he took advantage of her being with&#xD;
him, to ask her eox~iething about her friends the Getbois.&#xD;
There was living on the same floor a young student, who had&#xD;
a smattering of English, and Lucie ran and asked him for his&#xD;
assistance,~ to come and 'tell her what Mr Oldbuck was saying to&#xD;
her. A pale thin young man soon made his appearance to act as&#xD;
translator for them.&#xD;
"Will you' tell Malemoiselle Lucie," said Jonathan, "that t&#xD;
want to"k~aow something about 'the Gerbois, who they are, and what.&#xD;
is their' f~niily ?"&#xD;
The young man told her, and she began their genealogy, which,&#xD;
for augbt he kn'ew~ 'might ~ve n'~ounted up to the Capets and&#xD;
* Oharletwiagnes ~of Prench history, for she mentioned several families,&#xD;
the~names ~f'whioh were'familiar to Jonathan, as being those of seve-&#xD;
ral of 4he leading' families of France~ - He had seen th~ names in'&#xD;
the newspapers 'and vas rather surprised ~to find that his new ac-&#xD;
quaintanoes were allied to such a noble stock. Entertaining,&#xD;
however, home srispioions 'of their legitimacy, he' pushed his in-&#xD;
cjniries ~ 'little further, and asked how they themselves stood in&#xD;
society? ' ' '~&#xD;
Lucie replied! that they occupied an excellent position, and were&#xD;
courted and admired for' their rnann0rs and behavior.&#xD;
'Jonathan appeared delighted a't the revelation, but not wishing to&#xD;
lose such a good ~pj~oriuoity of hearing more about them, he asked.&#xD;
*hat character the girls bore themselves?&#xD;
Lucie ask0d what he meant?&#xD;
Mr Oldbnck said that he wished to know if they bore good cha$~.&#xD;
actors, that is to say, if they were virtuous.&#xD;
Ltu~ie's ey~te inflamed like those of a perfect' virago, they seemed.&#xD;
as if they W~te leaping out 'of their sockets, her face became th~&#xD;

Whether Jonathan was afraid that the claws df the angt~y~&#xD;
Py Lhohess would soon be tcansfi*ecl to his eyes~ ~r of having gone&#xD;
too 'far, it is impossible to say, but he began a series of apologies,&#xD;
which was almost as long as Lucie's genealogy of the aerbois&#xD;
family.&#xD;
Recrimination ceased, as much on account of Lucie's inclinatida&#xD;
not to offend her generous friend, as from Jonathan's desire to stand&#xD;
well in her opinion. He expressed his regret for having thrown out'&#xD;
the slightest insinuation against the honor and high standing of the&#xD;
Gerbois.family, and almost begged of 'Lucie, on his knees, not t~&#xD;
say a ~ord to them of what had occurred. Thus matters stood;&#xD;
an~1 Mr Oldbnck Was in a state of anxiety as to whether he 1i~d&#xD;
offefided his neighbors or not, until the&amp;amp; had renewed the agreeable&#xD;
relations subsisting between them, by asking him for the loan of' a~&#xD;
little Wine, as one ~f the childreti had been t~ken ill.&#xD;

asked twice as much for it~ as it was worth, and- the bargain was&#xD;
concluded by Mr Oldbuck's paying down thirty dollars for the first&#xD;
prq~ent he had given his belle. His generosity did not stop here,&#xD;
for~ somehow or other Lucie had forgotten her purse, an omission&#xD;
which Mr Oldbud would have fain attributed to accident, so of&#xD;
course, before liftcsrguerite and her cousin, he could not do other-&#xD;
wise than defray the bill, which amounted only to the small sum of&#xD;
seven dollars.&#xD;
The walk was concluded very much t6 the pleasure, and at the&#xD;
sa~ne time the annoyance of Jonathan Oldbuck, who was highly&#xD;
gratified at the marks of attention, which Margherite had shown&#xD;
h~ixi, but somewhat displeased at the suni of money he had spent.&#xD;
He was not a. man of, much means, and he was afraid that his.&#xD;
expenses were becoming so great, that he would have hardly&#xD;
enough money left to pay for his wedding, and bring his bride to&#xD;
America.&#xD;
This was a consideration, which he had almost overlooked, and&#xD;
when he returned to this lodgings, he begaa seriously to reflect on&#xD;
his extravagance. 1~ere was another difficulty, which he had never&#xD;
foreseen; on ~qr~nting overhis n~oney, he found he had only about two&#xD;
hundred and fifty dollars left, a sum, which he thought inadequate&#xD;
tQ~ Eis iuore~sed 9xpeIlses, on entering, the married state. He&#xD;
avuched forth into an outburst of passion at his reoklessness~ and&#xD;
pr~dioted all sorts o~' horrors at the position, in which he might b~&#xD;
placed. He fancied he was in prison, without the means of corn-&#xD;
nuinicating with his friends in Americt~, and inwardly reproached&#xD;
hiniseif for having spent upward,~ of forty dollars in his morning's&#xD;

&#xD;
.~.&#xD;
~ANCE-ALPHON5E&#xD;
~'ULLY EXPLAINED~&#xD;
EW YORK.&#xD;
&#xD;
THREE weeks had elapsed, and Oldbuck had been a constant&#xD;
~Asitor at the 0-erbois apartments, so much so, that Margueritef&#xD;
u~lways became anxious to see him, when seven o'clock arrived and&#xD;
he had not made his appearance. Since that eventful day on which&#xD;
118 had been introduced to the "cousins," he had not seen a solitary&#xD;
pair 4of breeches about the premises, which was a matter of satis-&#xD;
faction to a person of Jonathan's suspicious turn of mind. 'It is true&#xD;
he had not been there in the day time, for .Marguerite, on the plea~&#xD;
of some other pressing engagements, 'said her time was so much&#xD;
occupied, that he must always calVin the evening, when he would&#xD;
be sure to see her. Jonathan~was so far pleased with this arrange.&#xD;
ruent, that it afforded him su0icient time to see the lions of Paris,&#xD;
an agreeable sight for a stranger, and particularly for one who had&#xD;
spent the greater part of his life, in a small town of New England.&#xD;
One evening, Mr Oldbuck started from his residence in the Fau.~&#xD;
bourg Saint Jacques to the Rue de la Poissardiere, with the full&#xD;
deteriiiination of soliciting Marguerite's hand in marriage. There&#xD;
had been no precipitation in this case, for Jonathan had gone step&#xD;
by step, until he thought he had insinuated himself so completely&#xD;
in the fair grisette's affections, that he could safely claim her as hia&#xD;
bride.&#xD;
'Hither therefore he repaired, and found Marguerite never looking&#xD;
so charming and lovely, nor her conversation so lively and interest-&#xD;
ing. After remaining about an hour in her company, he told her,&#xD;
that he h~d come that evening for the express purpose of hearing&#xD;
from her own lips, the doom which was to consign him to everlast-&#xD;
ing happiness or misery, that she could not fail to observe, how deep&#xD;
was his love for her, and that he wished to know, whether shewould&#xD;
become his wife?&#xD;
When Jonathan. made this declaration, which was rather familiar&#xD;
to him from his long practice in such matters, he was seated near&#xD;
Marguerite, who at first blushed or rather orimsoned to the eyes,&#xD;
she then to6k her handkerchief, an4 affected to wipe away a tear~&#xD;
&#xD;
hanging in a position of the moat delightful abandon ovor Mr OWr&#xD;
buck's left shoulder. She gently, (oh ! how sweetly did th~ wdrd&#xD;
sound on the ear of her enraptured ad~nirer) pronounce&amp;amp; that&#xD;
monosyllable, "Yes," whi~h bomid her to him hencefor ard by tfr~&#xD;
solemn ties of a, matrimonial engagement.&#xD;
A thought struck 1~targuerit~, (but it was by t at~ought), f~r&#xD;
sh~e had no intention of withdrawing her promise, that if she ~&#xD;
ed some desire to make herself better a9qu~ir4ed with Mr Qid~&#xD;
buck's family and antecede~its, it might give him a better op~uon&#xD;
of her good faith, and strengthe~i his deterrninatior~ to, marry her.&#xD;
~o she begged of him to rela1~c tq her all about his birth and parent-&#xD;
age, at the same time begging him to pardon her, but intimating,&#xD;
that her aunt would be more satisfied,'if she ki~ew her niece was to&#xD;
be allied with, a family equally as respectable as her ow~i.&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuek recapitulated all, with which th9 reader i~.&#xD;
acquainted, omitting however several passages in his past life, which.&#xD;
he would not for 'the world have said anything about to Mar-'&#xD;
guerite. Th~ latter went out of th~ room for a few monients to&#xD;
confer with her aunt, end on her return expressed herself satisfie&amp;amp;&#xD;
with his explanation and told him, she had her aunt's consent to&#xD;
the marriage. Jonathan took the rosettete on his knees? threw his&#xD;
long sinewy arms around her delicate waist, and implanted a kie~~.&#xD;
on her cheeks, which filled his so with rapture. The aunt herr&#xD;
,, self shortly after made her appearance, and calling Marguerite to7&#xD;
her, whispered sorrlething in her ear, which her niece assented to.,&#xD;
Before Jonathan left that night, the grisette threw out a ger4~&#xD;
hint, that they were rather reduced iz~ means, an~ that 4L~p&#xD;
afraid, she would not be able to have a very extravaga~it troussec~u~&#xD;
on which Jonathan, of course, with that exuberant~ gen~rQ~ij~y for.&#xD;
which he was remarkable, took out oi'~'his pirse' a fifty dollar biW&#xD;
andhanded it to his fiancee~. Her eyes ~list9ned~with delight at th~&#xD;
sight of so much money, and another kiss rewarded the liberaht~4&#xD;
of 'the donor. The wedding day was fixed, and Wed~iesda~r of th~&#xD;
following week was to seal the fate of Jonathan Oldbuck andco4~,&#xD;
stitute him a Benedict.&#xD;
During his walk ho~ne that night, Mr Oldbuck 'revelled in all&#xD;
the anticipations of his future happiness. At length he had reach-'&#xD;
e4 th~ goal of his fondest, desires, he was to take 'a partner to his&#xD;
bosom, who was every way worthy of his name a~n4 family. Sh~&#xD;
was the personi4~cation of all that was lovely and amiable ~i~i liei'&#xD;
sex, and 'would be, wiien she arrived in America, the cynos~urc,&#xD;
around which all eyes would be fixed, admiring her grace an~&#xD;
beauty. What would his mother say, that dear mother, who&#xD;
watched all' his youthful days with suqji anxiety, and attended: h4~i.&#xD;
with so much care when he should present her with a daughter-in-'&#xD;
law, ccrnbining so many attractions of mind and person.&#xD;

<pb  n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7722-00000036"/>&#xD;
Oldbuck ran wild in his contemplation of the happiness, that was&#xD;
in store for him.&#xD;
Ris dreams that night were of a delightful grove in Arcadia,&#xD;
where there was one presiding Deity clothed in garments of purple&#xD;
and silver, whose brow was radiant with beams of effulgence and&#xD;
glory, and that he alone was a worshipper at her feet, receiving her&#xD;
rewards and the oL(ject of her smiles. Oh! how pleasing was the&#xD;
reverie of his midnight hours, not more so however, than his&#xD;
thoughts by day, for they were engrossed with all that related to&#xD;
his fair .?ifarguerite, whom he loved and adored.&#xD;
On the following day and indeed during the whole time, which&#xD;
intervened before his wedding, he was occupied in making prepara-&#xD;
tions for the approaching solemnity; and what with his frequent&#xD;
visits to tailors, and shoemakers, and the hours he spent with his&#xD;
beloved, the days passed away, and time was flying with a celerity&#xD;
which hurried him on to the most important epoch in his life.&#xD;
Sunday came, a day which most people devote to religious pur-&#xD;
poses, but which many spend in gossipping and talking. Since&#xD;
Jonathan knew, that his neighbor, the student, understood a little&#xD;
English, he had cultivated his acquaintance and became rather&#xD;
familiar with him. Alphonse do Very was a fine young man, he&#xD;
was kind and affectionate, and when he formed an intimacy with.&#xD;
any one, looked upon him as a friend, aiid took a deep interest in his&#xD;
welfare. He was a student for one of the learned professions, and&#xD;
as he was rather destitute of the means of living, .devoted his&#xD;
leisure hours to writing for the fruilletons of the press. This made&#xD;
"It necessary for him to become acquainted with the "in's and out's"&#xD;
of society, the secret springs, which keep the body politic in motion,&#xD;
and which require oiling jxow and then to make things go on&#xD;
smoothly. He kne* every person and every thing, and was a por-&#xD;
table biography of every one's life, services, and actions. So he&#xD;
knew all abbut th~ Gerbois' and when that fatal Sunday arrived,&#xD;
on which Jonathan expressed to him his intention of marrying and&#xD;
solicited his services as groomsman, he was thunder-struck at the&#xD;
frightful chasm, into which his friend was leaping. He at first&#xD;
pitied him,' then burst out in a fit of the loudest laughter.&#xD;
Jonathan asked him what he meant? -,&#xD;
"What I mean," said Alphon~se do Very, "why, that you will&#xD;
disgrace yourself by such a Qonnection."&#xD;
Mr Old buck drew himself up to his full length. Marguerite wa~&#xD;
~the embo~lirnentof virtue and excellence, she was allied with the&#xD;
most noble families of France, and if he dared to say another word&#xD;
to her prejudice, he would consider it as a personal affront, and take&#xD;
vengeance on the spot.&#xD;
Alphonse do Very ,burst out into another almost hysterical fit of&#xD;
laughteft&#xD;
"Good God! what~ does this mean ?" said Mr. Oldbuok.&#xD;

&#xD;
"It means," said Alphonse, "that Marguerite aerbois is a ~irl&#xD;
of the town, she has long been noted for her vicious habits, and I&#xD;
regard you too much as a friend, to allow you to be deceived any&#xD;
longer, and think it my dnty to put you on your guard against con-&#xD;
tracting any such alliance."&#xD;
Jonathai~ stride up and down the room with the pace of a giant,&#xD;
his face was blanched, his teeth were chattering, and his whole&#xD;
frame evinced ihe most sensible signs of emotion. "Give me some&#xD;
proofs," said he to Alphonse, at the same time shaking the young&#xD;
man with all his strength, "or I will challenge you to mortal&#xD;
combat, for the injury you have done to my affianced bride."&#xD;
Alphonse de Very would have left the room, and Mr Oldbuck to&#xD;
the fate which awaited him, but a feeling of benevolence prevented&#xD;
the young man from leaving his acquaintance on a precipice from&#xD;
which, in one leap, he would have been consigned to perpetual&#xD;
infamy. "Proofs," said he~ "come with me this afternoon, now,&#xD;
if you please, and I will give you snch evidence of her perfidy and&#xD;
vice, that you cannot be mistaken."&#xD;
"This afternoon-no, this very moment," said Oldbuck," or I&#xD;
will wring -.-."&#xD;
Alphonse observed, "You need not again get, into a passion, Mr&#xD;
Qldbuek, but I will undertake this very ~moment to convince you&#xD;
that you placed your affections .on an object that is entirely un-&#xD;
worthy of them. Come with me," said the young man, and both&#xD;
hurried their steps to the Rue de la Poissardiere.&#xD;
On their way thither, Alphonse met one of his friends, who spoke&#xD;
English fluently, and whom he introduced to Mr Oldbuek, saying,&#xD;
he wished him to accompany him. as a witness, to convince him&#xD;
that he was telling the truth. The three arrived at the Gerbois&#xD;
residence, where they were usjiered into the same room that was&#xD;
inhabited by the old woman whom Jonathan had see~ii op a previous&#xD;
occasion.   por          wine 1emme, sai Alph6nse, at the&#xD;
"Comment     tez vous b     'i'"&#xD;
same time directing his friend to translate to Mr Oldbuck, in Eng-&#xD;
lish, what the old woman said in French.&#xD;
~The substance of what she said was as follows: that she could&#xD;
no longer live in the house, that the noiseon the floor immediately&#xD;
above her was such, that she had no peace by day nor rest at night,&#xD;
that for the last three weeks, between the hours of seven and ten,&#xD;
or eleven at night, things were a little quieter, and that she availed&#xD;
herself of that time to. take a little rest, but during the whole day&#xD;
and remainder of the night, it was a constant thoroughfare for the&#xD;
wildest and most debauched yo~ing men, that there was drinking,&#xD;
singing, and dancing, and that for her 'part, she had almost made&#xD;
up her mind to leave the house, for she had complained to the land-&#xD;
lord, and he had taken no notice of her' remonstrances.&#xD;
Jonathan~s face grew paler and paler, during the recital of this&#xD;
&#xD;
+g&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7722-00000037"/>&#xD;
so                 JON ATH4N OLDRUOK&#xD;
story, but being not y4 convinced, said to Alphonse, "the proofs~&#xD;
the proofs, J want !"&#xD;
"Is it&#xD;
immediate that. you, want ?" said Alphonse; "you sh~ll hav8 them&#xD;
see the ai~ZA~i~e met our friend Theodore Lavergue, on his way to&#xD;
Marguerite, the virtuous and tender grisette. We&#xD;
Miall go up stairs and pay them a visit, while you will look through&#xD;
the key hole, and see your affianced bride in his arms, he wilt&#xD;
implant a kiss on her cheeks, the sound of which you will hear&#xD;
in the h a1l~ and if ~hat'5 not enough, I know not what you re-&#xD;
q~zire."&#xD;
"It will be enoi~gh, enough," said Jonathan, "and II shall b~&#xD;
satisfiedd tha~t I have been the dupe of the vilest of her sex."&#xD;
The threc proceeded up stairs, Alphonse and Theodore entering&#xD;
the room, while Mr Oldbuck remained without, with his eye to the&#xD;
key hole. His spectacles increased the magnitude of the sight which&#xD;
he Witnessed, for there was his amiable and adored 1J1argz~erite, the&#xD;
object of his love, and the cynosure around which all were to&#xD;
assemble in admiration of her charms, in the arms of Theodore&#xD;
Lav~rgne, who implanted a kiss on her cheeks, and ~ *&#xD;
*    *     *    but we shall not remove the veil, which must for&#xD;
e~rer conceal such sights from the public ~eye, but which fell on the&#xD;
astonished vision of Jonathan Oldbuck, with frightful, almost alarm-&#xD;
ing effect. Sitting on the floor, he leaned his head against the door&#xD;
of the adjoining apartment, and when his friend Alphonse came out&#xD;
of the room, found him so pale and Weak, that he was afraid he&#xD;
wa~ going .1~o fall into a fit. Raising him up from the ground,&#xD;
AAp'honse stipported him on his arm, amd brought him hpme to his&#xD;
lodgings, where he was put to bed and remained confined for three&#xD;
'weeks, with, a brain fever, which almost threatened his existence.&#xD;
Alphonse remained as a faithful attendant at his bedside during the&#xD;
whole of his illness, and often wondered what the man's antecedents&#xD;
were, or what was his disposition, that he should be taken ill in&#xD;
consequence4 of the unsuccessful termination of an affair of love.&#xD;
Hjs must indeed be a very susceptible heart, thought Alphonse, that&#xD;
is so easily impressed with the charms of the fair sex and he more&#xD;
than o~ice regretted the necessity of imparting to his friend, what he&#xD;
'Acnew about the Gerbois family.&#xD;
Time is the assuager~of all evils, it alleviates man's sorrows,' and&#xD;
if there has been any thing reprehensible, which he has done, makes&#xD;
him ,regret his~'past conduct; but there is no period like that of&#xD;
oonvalesenoe, when one's' reflcctiQns crowd on his mind, an ci he&#xD;
-I~itterly repents his errors. Thus it was with Jonathan Oldbuck,&#xD;
in the long dreary hours~ when his returning strength enabled him&#xD;
'~ sit up in his bed with no attendant at his side,- for Alphonse's&#xD;
duty called him away; he thotight how credulous he had been,&#xD;
what overweening confidence he had placed in a girl who was, as&#xD;
ahe deserved to be, the oUtcast and refuse of society, lie blamed&#xD;

came into the room to borrow something else.&#xD;
Jonathan's visage assumed a most frightful aspect, it went through&#xD;
every contortion which ~could appear on the human countenance,&#xD;
and the little boy r~n out of the room in wild alarm, crying out that&#xD;
Monsieur Okibuck was dying. - The appearance of Lucie and her&#xD;
father did not add to the patient's composure, and he gave vent to&#xD;
the most violent expressions of anger, ordering them peremptorily&#xD;
out of the room, and telling them he never wished to see their faces&#xD;
again.&#xD;
There is no misunderstanding a man, when he is in a passion, the&#xD;
eyes proclaim what the lips may fail to tell, and the whole features.&#xD;
announce an outburst of feeling, which can always be comprehended.&#xD;
Lucie made her escape from the room, followed by her father, quite&#xD;
at a loss to know what had ~stirred up her friend's- ire against them.&#xD;
Had she understood Mr Jonathan Oldbuck's 'language, she would -&#xD;
have heard the ~ilest epithets applied both to the - Gerbois and her-&#xD;
self, imputing all his misery and the illness he had undergone, to&#xD;
her base and infamous falsehoods about their genealogy &amp;amp;nd descent.&#xD;
At length he was able to leave his bed, and 2look about his affairs&#xD;
preparatory to his - departure for New York. He had seen enough&#xD;
-of Paris to convince him, that in leaving America he had not altered&#xD;
his - condition for the' better, and he resolved on returning immedi-&#xD;
ately to greet his mother and friends in the Empire City. The first&#xD;
duty he performed, on rising from his bed' of sickness, was to make&#xD;
out the aocounf against his neighbors, and present it to them for&#xD;
payment. He found it amounted to upwards of forty dollars, a.-&#xD;
trifling sum to be sure, but as his means were rather reduced from&#xD;
the expenses attendant on his late illness,,~he wanted all that was&#xD;
- due to him, lie sent the bill to the occupants of the adjoining&#xD;
room, but no notice was taken of it, the second, third, and fourth -&#xD;
day passed, and still the bill was not paid. He requested his 'friend&#xD;
Alphonse de Yery to call on them and demand payment, which the&#xD;
young man agreed to do.&#xD;
Alphonse returned, followed I~ the father, who said, that he owed&#xD;
Mr Oldbuck nothing, that his daughter Lucie was a couturier, who&#xD;
was dependent for her livelihood on her needle, and that they had a&#xD;
bill against Mr Oldbui~k, for his daughter's time, which he had&#xD;

scene of mutual recrimination, in which Jonathan came to th~ very&#xD;

The .Etavre packet was to sail for New York in a few days, and&#xD;
before three weeks had elapsed, Jonathan placed his foot on the piers&#xD;
of the-Empire City, with great joy at his release from the trials and&#xD;
temptations~ of life in Paris, and resolved to be wiser for the future.                       CHAPTER XI.&#xD;

him .to be a mpre worthy man than what he really is. Sue:&#xD;

after giving a hearty welcome to his aged mother, she ent~&#xD;
him with what people had been saying about him during&#xD;

f~1l~grown daughters, who were very anxious to know, if he ii&#xD;

deep and heavy sigh) she said, there were the Browns,&#xD;
Spacers and ~ host of others, who had visited her si~ice huis del&#xD;
and there were atiwngst them several beautiful girls, from&#xD;
her dear son would have no dif~lculty in selecting a wife.&#xD;
Jonathan remarked, " my dear mother, if you have any&#xD;

again. I know enough of the follies and frailties of woma&#xD;
to debar me for ever from a closer relationship with them, an&#xD;

The old woman shook her head, and wondered why her J(&#xD;
had taken such a dislike to the fair sex.&#xD;
Six months had elapsed, during which time, Jonathan led&#xD;
bachelor's life, no persuasion or entreaty of 'his mother's could&#xD;
him to leave his room and come down stairs to see the fair&#xD;
ladies, who were fi#equent visitors at her house. They, heai&#xD;

JONATHAN OLDBTJOK&#xD;
Wealth is like a load-stone, possessing powerful magnetic attrae.&#xD;
tion, bvtt when it is combined with intelligence, old maids and&#xD;
dowerlesss daughters flock around the owner, like flies in summer on&#xD;
a plate of molasses.~ The latter, however, partake of sweets, whilst&#xD;
the former, if they only had seen Mr Oldbuck, night have had their&#xD;
'taste' so' much soured at the sight, that they would have envied&#xD;
neither his wealth nor his intelligence. He had not improved ~n&#xD;
his looks since his return, and his serious illness in Paris had&#xD;
~shattered a constitution, whi6h age also was beginning to impair.&#xD;
Ladies are however proverbial for their curiosity, and with some of&#xD;
Xrs Oldbuck's acquaintances, it was almost diffiojilt to restrain&#xD;
them from going up to. Mr Oldbu0k's room, to take a peep at her&#xD;
eon. Jonathan was never remarkable for his beauty, although,&#xD;
when dress added to the adornment of his person, he might have&#xD;
been considered passable by some, but if the young ladies had gone&#xD;
up in h~is room and seen him, unshaven, with his long blue morning&#xD;
gown ~nd red slippers, they might have taken him for an apparition&#xD;
from a other world, and stoo?1 aghast at the sight.&#xD;
Jonathan Was beginning to get tired of this monotonous mode of&#xD;
'living, so l~e frequented the coffee-houses and saloons oftener than&#xD;
usual, un~l' his mother began to remonstrate with him on the late-&#xD;
ness of the hour, at which he returned home, and advised him to&#xD;
be more pruden* for the future.&#xD;
One evening, Oldbuok strolled into a bowling saloon, in the vici-&#xD;
nity of Ohatham square, where he became rather interested in the&#xD;
sport. There was a young man, who was so expert in knocking&#xD;
down the nine-pins, that he attracted Jonathan's attention, and he&#xD;
was surprised to'find in the successful player the person of his old&#xD;
rival, Charley Seagrave. They mutually recognized each other, and&#xD;
it was ncTt long 'before they becarndb so friendly, that they took a&#xD;
glass of brandy together at the adjoining bar. The conversation&#xD;
soon turned about the Switzers, where Seagrave remembered he&#xD;
was introduced to his fr~nd, and Jonathan was surprised to hear,&#xD;
tb~at'his first love Louisa Switzer was the mother of two children&#xD;
and likely to have a third. Seagrave. 'mentioned to him, how often&#xD;
Louisa spoke to him of her old friend and admirer, Jonathan Old-&#xD;
buck, and said that he was sure, no visit would afford~ her greater&#xD;
pleasure than his, if.he would call upon her. Taking out a card and&#xD;
pencil, he wrote his name and address, which was in Madison&#xD;
street, No.-. Jonathan replied, he would have much pleasure&#xD;
in calling on Mrs Seagrave.&#xD;
Talk not of your palaces in the avenues, of those noble man-&#xD;
sions, where their inmates are pampered with every luxury, that&#xD;
wealth oaff'afford, where the favored' child of, fortune is brought up&#xD;
by fond parents, who allow no wish to remain ungratified, nor no&#xD;
bope to be unfulfilled. It is not there! in the midst of the splen-&#xD;

On the following morning Mr Oldbuck repaired to the pl&amp;amp;oe,~&#xD;
which had been indicated as 'Seagrave's residence, and found Louisa~&#xD;
at home. Sh~ wa~ 'rriueh altered in her appearance, and he soaree~~&#xD;
ly recognised her. The place and the furniture were so different&#xD;
from that'whioh he had seen in her fathers 'house,' that he was at-&#xD;
no loss to account forihe' change in her person. In 'tWo apartrra.ents&#xD;
on the right Irand side of the 'hall, on the~ first floor, was the abode&#xD;
of Charley Seagrave's wife' and 'children, for 'it could hardly be said&#xD;
to be the' residence of the: husband; who spent his' 'days and nights'&#xD;
around the bars of restaurants' or 'in the' bowling saloon. Three&#xD;
ricketty straw-bottomed chairs, a table, on which were the orurVibs.&#xD;
of perhaps the last!' h~kf; that was in the hotise, '&amp;amp;' small stoVe,&#xD;

Jonathan had never 'before 'seen~ find hisheart was moved' to pity'&#xD;
at the sight of an old fi~eird, in such a stste of dietrbss. She beg.&#xD;
ged hii~i to be seated, 'and in answer to an irVqr~iey about her par-&#xD;
ents and sisters, she' bui~t into a flood of tears, 'find replied, that' as&#xD;
for the 'former, 'she had never' seen them since her marriage, and for'&#xD;
the letter,' when she did' meet some of them in the streets, they&#xD;
scawely noticed her. 'She supposed, however, she 'said, that it was~&#xD;
owing to' her fa'the~'s Orders, for he Was very severe in his judg--&#xD;
ments, 'and perhaps had told therrinot to speak to her.&#xD;
"Jonathan asked her the reason, why her parents were angry w'itht&#xD;
her; 'when' ehe began the recital of' atale of woe, that would have-&#xD;
softened the heart of the most obdurate.'&#xD;
She said, "After you had ceased, sir, to visit at the house, my&#xD;
brother' was ocustantly reproaohing me with 'having been the cause&#xD;
of i't ~ she applied the vilest terms-to me~ which ought hot to escape&#xD;

our intimacy and marriage. Charley remained in his employment~&#xD;
for some months after, earning six dollars a week, a sum, which&#xD;
was quite adequate to our expenses, but when our family increased,&#xD;
they became insufficient, and he left his place to go to another,&#xD;
where~he was promised higher wages. From some cause or other,&#xD;
he was not long in this employment, and although the failure to&#xD;
receive his weekly stipend caused us some annoyance, we did not&#xD;
at ~rst feel it, but weeks passed over and he got no place. I would&#xD;
have taken in sewing, but he would not hearof it one; after the&#xD;
other, however, of the few things we had, was sold to buy us our&#xD;
food, and pay for the rent of these rooms; in all my distress, I then&#xD;
never regretted my marriage with Charley, he was kind and affec..&#xD;
tionate to me, and when he had the means, there was no wish of&#xD;
mine that he did not gratify. He finally got a place, but was in it&#xD;
~only three weeks, when he lost it again. I could not account for&#xD;
the misfortune, but a few days after, the mystery was solved, for&#xD;
any husband came into the room reeling in a state of intoxication,&#xD;
~and here Louisa put her hands to her face, which became suffused&#xD;
with tears.&#xD;
Jonathan Oldbuck was not a man of much sensibility (excepting&#xD;
in matters of love), he was rather hardhearted in all others, but he&#xD;
could not withhold his' sympathy from the young mother, as she&#xD;
Was detailing her wrongs and misfortunes. Intemperance is the&#xD;
canker-worm which gnaws at the vitals of all who are its victims.&#xD;
it degrades man from the position he might occupy in t~ie social&#xD;
scale, and renders him unfit for the common offices and duties of&#xD;
life. If its evils fell on his own head alone, there might be suffi~&#xD;
cient punishment for the crime, but when they fall on the wife and.&#xD;
mother, and on those who are least able to avoid them, the&#xD;
latter become indeed fit objects for the charity and benevolence of&#xD;
man. So thought Jjonathan, as he looked on the mother in afflic-&#xD;
tion, withdier two babes at her side, deprived of their protector,&#xD;
who was spending his days and nights at the drinking saloon!&#xD;
He asked Louisa when she had last seen he~ husband, and she&#xD;
replied that he scarcely ever came there, but when he did, would&#xD;
throw a half dollar on the table, and'leave the house, without even&#xD;
kissing the children, and here the young mother again burst forth&#xD;
into the wildest expressions of grief.&#xD;
Jonathan found that nothing ho could say, would console Louisa&#xD;
in her afiliotion, btit he could do something, and that he did imme..&#xD;
4iately, by taking his purse tout of his pocket, and handing her a&#xD;
five dollar bill. At first she did not like to accept it, but when he&#xD;
told her it was the grateful offering of an old friend,~ who would, for&#xD;
the~ future, take pleasure in watching over the fate of herself ~nd&#xD;
her babes, she took it with herr eyes glistening with joy.&#xD;
"One favor," said Jonathan, "I must request of you; it is,&#xD;
&#xD;
that. you will give no part of the money to your husband, for&#xD;
he would only~ take it to the saloon and spend it in liquor."&#xD;
"Indeed I shall not," said Louisa, "in fact he will not know&#xD;
that I have it, and if he 'did, he would not get it."&#xD;
Jonathan left, promising to return again shortly, with his mind&#xD;
full of sad reflections on the vices of men, and the pitifull state to&#xD;
which they ofttimes reduce the partners of their bosoms.&#xD;
Did a solitary idea spring up in Jonathan's mind, that if Louisa&#xD;
Switzer had married him, her fate would have been different? No,&#xD;
there did not, for it was engrossed with the memory of what he had&#xD;
just seen and heard, a picture of misery and a tale of woe, that&#xD;
would move the heart of the most insensible. Could there be,&#xD;
thought Oldbuck, a wretch in human form who would desert a&#xD;
wife, who had always been faithful to him and her young children,&#xD;
for the intoxicating pleasures of the cup; if there were, it were&#xD;
better that poison were mixed in the baneful beverage, than that&#xD;
4inother and an innocent person should suffer.&#xD;
He returned home, and told his mother of what he had seen that&#xD;
morning, and the old woman was quite afflicted at the narration.&#xD;
She wanted to go and see her immediately, but when'Jonathan told&#xD;
her that he had relieved her ,necessities for the present, she said,&#xD;
"you did right, my boy, and heaven will bless you."&#xD;
Jonathan continued to lead the same life he had done, since his&#xD;
return from France, but would occasionally go out in the evening&#xD;
to whxi~ away an hour or two at some of his favorite places of&#xD;
resort. He had not seen Ned Hammersley since his return, and one&#xD;
evening as he was walking in the park, espied his old friend with a&#xD;
lady hanging on his arm, whom he had no difficulty in recognizing&#xD;
as the fair Angelina herself, Mrs Augustus Shrewsbury, whose&#xD;
trusting husband, he supposed, was still digging gold in California.&#xD;
He would not salute him at that moment, for the sight of Mrs&#xD;
Shrewsbury revived recollections, which he would fain have buried&#xD;
in oblivion, but he resolved to call on him the following morning,&#xD;
and talk about old times.&#xD;
He went there the next day, and the greeting was cordial on both&#xD;
sides.&#xD;
"Well, Ned," said Jonathan, "how goes on the California&#xD;
'widow ?"'&#xD;
"She wants to get a divorce from her husband," said Ned, "a&#xD;
measure to which I am decidedly opposed. Since my return from&#xD;
Cuba (for he too had been travelling), I wished to get rid of her, but&#xD;
she finds my company so entertaining, that it is rather a difficult&#xD;
matter."              .                /&#xD;
"And I dare say," said Jonathan, "that you find her's so agree..&#xD;
able, that you don't wish t~ do any thing of the kind."&#xD;
Hammersley turned round and whistled a tune, whilst4Jonathan&#xD;
was thinking of the confidence of husbands, and the faithlesSness ~f&#xD;

"Holloa, Ned," cried Jonathan, as they were proceeding on their&#xD;
way down town, "whose beautiful pair of greys are those in that&#xD;
carriage ?"&#xD;
"They belong to old Isaiah Gibson, who married a short time&#xD;
ago, a young and lovely wife; I'll tell you all about it after dinner,"&#xD;
and the two friends proceeded to flelmonico's, according to appoint.&#xD;
inent, to regale themselves on the dainties that are usually set be.&#xD;
fore visitors in that favorite place of resort.&#xD;
On their way there, Hammereley entertained Jonathan with a&#xD;
short account of hie travels in Louisiana and Cuba, those tropii~al&#xD;
climes to which ardent young men are in the habit of repairing, to&#xD;
admire the mellow complexions' and fair forms of southern ladies.&#xD;
He had visited Natchitochez on Red River, and seen plantations&#xD;
on the Washita and the Alabama, and had returned quite a convert&#xD;
on the important subject of slavery. Like many others, he viewed&#xD;
the question relatively to the state of the master rather than the&#xD;
slave; for the latter he had little sympathy, but he envied the power&#xD;
of the former, and had almost come to the conclusion of selling out&#xD;
his property in New York~ and emigrating to the South. There is&#xD;
something alluring in the aspect of southern slavery to a young&#xD;
man of warm temperament, whose regard for the welfare of his&#xD;
race is not circumscribed by country or color, but' who views all&#xD;
alike, as fit objects of his sdicitude and benevolence.&#xD;
The two entered Delmonico's, where they renewed their friendly&#xD;
relations over the choice fare and delicious wine, of which they par&#xD;
took, and after dinner, Hammersley narrated to Jonathan the town&#xD;
gossip" about old Isaiah Gibson's marriage with Theophilus Olements'&#xD;
young and lovely daught~r. He began:&#xD;
"Clarence Fitz Simmons was deeply enamoured of the girl, and&#xD;
report, says, she returned his affection He belonged to one of the&#xD;
first families in the city, and his father 4eeupied a mansion in one of&#xD;

there was a twinge of Jonathan's upper lip, which it Was well Ned&#xD;

held the golden wand in her hand, and she had only to do her&#xD;
fa4her's bidding, to ensure her! misery, and his! happiness.&#xD;
"Fitz Simmons' visits to his house were strictly forbidden, and all&#xD;

"In the meantime, every opportunity was afforded to old Gibson to&#xD;
visit at the house. His appearance must have been loathsome in&#xD;
the highest degree, to the tastes and inclinations of a young girl of&#xD;
seventeen. H~e was, bald-headed, with the exception of a few grey&#xD;
Iw~rs, which were drawn over his ears, he had an ugly pug-nose, on'&#xD;

the heart's despair, and a striking example of the brutality of man.&#xD;
Her days were numbered, and although you saw her this morning&#xD;
seated ~y the side of her husband in a carriage drawn by those grey&#xD;
horses, which attracted your attention, all who know her, say, that&#xD;
she is going fast to her grave.~~&#xD;
"And what became of Fitz Sii'nmons ?" asked Jonathan.&#xD;
"He b~ame almost raving mad, and at one time his friends were&#xD;
about taking him to an asylum. I believe, however, they travelled&#xD;
with him, and I have not heard of him lately?'&#xD;
"It's a sad talc," said Jopatlian, "and I dare say there arc many&#xD;
fathers in this happy country, who sell their daughters for money."&#xD;
"Yes," replied, Ned, "and Ah good they get of it. Poor&#xD;
miserable beings, who are like moths, that flicker about a candle,&#xD;
only leading .to their destruction; wealth is the Ilame which con-&#xD;
sumes them at last, it lures them, for it is attractive, but it swal.&#xD;
lows up every noble impulse of virtue and honor."&#xD;
During the conversation at the dinner table, -Jonathan appeared&#xD;
wholly absorbed with what Hammnersley was telling him, he had&#xD;
&#xD;

JONATHAN OLDBUOK&#xD;
&#xD;
been too deeply interested himself in the fate of byporah Clements,&#xD;
not to feel anxious to hear all that concerned her, and when his&#xD;
friend Ned had finished his sorrowful tale, he was cast into a state&#xD;
of the deepest reflection. His thoughts wandered to the scenes of&#xD;
other days, when he considered he had a fair claim to the hand&#xD;
and heart of the girl he was speaking about. He was repulsed on&#xD;
account of his poverty; 'the father, said he to himself, will soon have&#xD;
a good example of the effects of wealth, and the memory of the.&#xD;
wrongs he has done his child will cling to him, till he follows her to&#xD;
the grave.&#xD;
Did a thought again obtrude itself on Jonathan's mind, that had&#xD;
she married hem, her fate also might have been different? There&#xD;
did not, for the sadness of the tale which he had heard, chased&#xD;
away any ideas of a selfish character.&#xD;
They remained until rather alate hour at Delmonico's, when they&#xD;
bade each other adieu, and returned to their respective homes.&#xD;
On the following day, Jonathan accompanied his mother on a&#xD;
visit to' Mrs Seagrave, who again appeared quite happy oi~ seeihg&#xD;
her old friends. When she told Mrs Oldbuck, what she had nar.&#xD;
rated to Jonathan the day~~before, the old woman volunteered he'&#xD;
services to call en her parents and endeavor to effect a reconciliation&#xD;
but the young mother begged of her to desist from doing so, as sh~&#xD;
was not sensible of having offered them any injury, and they should'&#xD;
be the first to call and see her.&#xD;
"However wrong I may have been," said Louisa, "in having&#xD;
married a man against their wishes, I think there should be a 1~ernx&#xD;
to a parents' displeasure, and I should be the last person in th~&#xD;
world~ to do violence to my feelings, by making them believe, that I&#xD;
was a supplant on their' charity. No4 said ~he, I would soone#&#xD;
toil night and day for the support of my helpless orphans, (for they&#xD;
have been abandoned by their natural protector) rather than beg fox'&#xD;
assistance at the hands of those who should be the first to oLThr i\&#xD;
to me. 'I was a young girl, and may have committed errors, (ane~ ~&#xD;
here poor Louisa shed again abundant tears) but a father shouk~&#xD;
never forget his daughter, and we are taught to believe by the pre&#xD;
c.epts of our holy religion, that repentance can never come'.1;oo late~&#xD;
it is the bright spot which shows us the errors of the past, and illu&#xD;
wines our paths for the future."'&#xD;
Thus spoke the lonely mother, with one babe suckling at he&amp;amp;'&#xD;
breast, and the other in a oradleiat her feet, and what father who&#xD;
could look on his child in such a state4 ought not to feel compassion&#xD;
for her misery, and repent for the wrongs he had done her?&#xD;
Jonathan and his mother left the young woman with sad reflee..&#xD;
tions on the severity of fathers, and the errors of children.&#xD;
On their return home, they found the Spicers waiting for them&#xD;
in the parlor, for Kitty Spicer, having heard from the 'servant, that&#xD;
Mrs Oldbuok had gone out for a few moments, accompanied by her&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
son, thought, as tie would of course return with her,. it would&#xD;
be a favorable opportunity, to make his acquaintance, and see how.&#xD;
her charms would work upon him. She was a' tall, ugly looking&#xD;
girl, with a nose almost as long as the ringlets that fell from her&#xD;
hair, it was crooked too, but there was something in her eye, which&#xD;
possessed the powers of attraction, and she wore bracelets with rib-&#xD;
bons on her long skinny arms, which gave her in 5onathan's opinion&#xD;
quite a fascinating appearance. Her conversation was lively and&#xD;
interesting, she had a quick mode of pronouncing her words, which&#xD;
sounded rather harsh, it was true, and her voice was shriller than&#xD;
what' Mr Oldbuck might have desired, but had she been "fat,"&#xD;
besides being "fresh and forty," she would have been a very suit-&#xD;
able match for one who was rather advanced in years. Jonathan&#xD;
appeared rather smitten with her charms, and she' took good care to&#xD;
cast glances "fast and thick" at the object of her attraction. They&#xD;
fell so thickly around ~him, that the arrows at length pierced his&#xD;
heart, and he was for the last time, it is to be hoped, a humble sup-&#xD;
pliant at the feet of Kitty Spicer.&#xD;
His courtship was not of long duration, for when an old maid&#xD;
beings to bear such a heavy battery against the heart of an old&#xD;
bachelor, the citadel is sure to yield, after the storming it has on-&#xD;
countered. The breach was made, and Jonathan thought there was&#xD;
no hope of filling it up, but by entering into an alliance, so he pro-&#xD;
posed marriage, the only mode of putting a stop to tbi~ warfare.&#xD;
Kitty Spicer accepted him, and he had thus a fair prospect of enter-&#xD;
ing the hyrneneal state, and becoming a Benedict. Matters pro-&#xD;
gresssed favorably, and after the usual quantity of sighs, oaths,&#xD;
and protestations, both parties prepared for an alteration in their&#xD;
respeotive~~6onditions in life&#xD;
Old Mrs Oldbuck clapped her hands with joy, when Jonathan&#xD;
came h~nie and told her, that Kitty Spicer had accepted him, and&#xD;
immediately began to make preparations for the wedding. Jona-&#xD;
titan him~eIf was as "happy es man could be," and spent his time be-&#xD;
tWeen visits to the tailors, and the object of his affections. Kitty&#xD;
was as kind and affectionate as her nature permitted her, but one day,&#xD;
as Jonathan *as standing behind tier, while she was looking in the&#xD;
glass, he thought he detected rather a queer looking expression,&#xD;
which betokened anger, a' rather, bad feeling on the eve of one's&#xD;
marriage. He chased away the idea from his mind, thinking it&#xD;
might only have arisen from dissatisfaction at the fit of a new dress&#xD;
she was trying on, ~r perhaps that the mirror being dusty, it did&#xD;
not reflect the' charms of her beautiful! face. The peculiar expres-&#xD;
sion and contortion of her countenance on that morning haunted&#xD;
him however in the trying scenes of his after life, and he reproacheal&#xD;
himself more than once for having overlooked it, and married such&#xD;
a girl.&#xD;
The wedding day at length arrived, and it was ushered in with&#xD;

all due solemnities and forms. Carriages were sent to the residence&#xD;
ot~M:rs Spicer, and the happy bride and bridegroom proceeded to&#xD;
t~huroh, where the knot was tied, the Register of Church, iii&#xD;
this City, showing, that on the day of March, 185-., Jona-&#xD;
th~n Oldbuck, Esquire, was 'lawfull~? joined in the holy bands of&#xD;
matrimony, with Catherine Spicer, both of New York.&#xD;
* The honeymoon passed over with the usual enjoyment of that&#xD;
happy period in life. Jonathan told his mother, that the measure&#xD;
~f'his ha~~iness was full to overflowing, whil~t Kitty assured her's,&#xD;
she wondered how she c~uld so long have done without a husband,&#xD;
was so kind and good.&#xD;
tI~he newly married couple hired a house in East Broadway, where&#xD;
they passed their 4Ame pleasantly enough for a few, months. Mar-&#xD;
ried life certainly operates a very great change in a man's habits&#xD;
and tastes, he no longer keeps late hours, but settles down as a.&#xD;
~piiet, domesticated anirhal, ready to do his wife's bidding, and con-&#xD;
sult all lies wishes. So it was with Jonathan at first, but he ~oori&#xD;
found out that his wife was a shrew, that' she was inclined to have&#xD;
n~re of her way than he wished, and finally began to doubt whether&#xD;
hehad changed his condition for the better. Kitty was all smiles&#xD;
at first, then all frowns, until at length he became accustomed to&#xD;
~idge of her temper by her face, as one looks at a barometer to tell&#xD;
what sort of weather he may expect. Jonathan, however, made a&#xD;

CONCLUSION-FAMILY 3ARS-DOMICILIARY VISIT OF THE NEW YORK POLICE&#xD;
TO SONATHAN OLIThUCK'S RESIDENCE-KITTY SPICER NOT IMPROVED BY&#xD;
MARRIAGE&#xD;
OnE afternoon, Jonathan came running into his mother's. house&#xD;
exclaiming,&#xD;
"Mother! mother! she's the very di~vi1; I can Jive no longer&#xD;
with her, indeed I cannot."&#xD;
"Who, my boy ?" asked Mr~ Oldbuck.&#xD;
"Why, Kitty, mother'; I happened to trample on her little dog,&#xD;
a poodle, as ehe calls it, and she flew at me, calling me a brute&#xD;
and every name she could put her tongue to. She was in such&#xD;
a passion, that I thought she would have scratched me with&#xD;
her long nails, and I was glad to make my escape from the&#xD;
house~"&#xD;
"~ ~toiiathan, my boy," said Mrs Oldbuck,' "this will never answer,&#xD;
I must go and see Kitty."&#xD;
"It~sno use, mother, I tell you it's no use, she is a perfect virago,&#xD;
and she gives way so much to her passion that ~he won't'sp~ak'to&#xD;
me for *hole days together, and .at nights she turns her back ~&#xD;
me, and' mtkes mc feel miserable. I'm sorry I've married, mother,&#xD;
but 'I si4pose I must put up with it the best way I can."&#xD;
Mrs Oldbuck was a benevolent old 'lady, she loved her son&#xD;
an affection which is even seldom shown by mothers, and she really&#xD;
pitied Jonathan as he rebited to her ~is wrongs. She finally per-&#xD;
suaded him to allow her to accompany him to his house, and wh~n&#xD;
thej arrived there, a scene of crimination and recrimination ensu&amp;amp;l,&#xD;
whieli baffles all description.                    '&#xD;
'Sonathan reproached Kitty for her cruel conduct towards him,&#xD;
Kility called him a brute.&#xD;
Jonathan said, "see mother, what language' ehe uses," and the2'&#xD;
latter replied, "my children, this should not be so, you should live&#xD;
'in, peace together." *&#xD;
""I can't," 'said' Kitty, "indeed I can't;" ahd ehe began to shed a&#xD;
few crocodile tears; "he's a br~ate," l6oki~g'~rp with her l&amp;amp;tgo&#xD;

* flaming eyes at Jonathan, which quite alarmed him, and almos*&#xD;
made him lose his equilibrium. "He does every thing to annoy&#xD;
me, he linds fault if I see my friends, keeps me waiting for him for&#xD;
dinner, broke a beautiful, china ornament on the mantle-~iece the&#xD;
other day, and this morning almost killed my dog, by trampling on&#xD;
it with his big heavy foot."&#xD;
"Jonathan," said his mother, "you shouldn't do so."&#xD;
"Mamma, I never did anything of the kind."&#xD;
"Your'e a liar," said Kitty.&#xD;
"Your'e a ," but he restrained himself in his mother's&#xD;
presence.&#xD;
"I was going to tell you," saiE Jonathan, "all about it. Mr.&#xD;
Wilkins, who called here the other day, remained so long fri the&#xD;
room speaking with Kitty about old times, pleasant evenings spent&#xD;
together and so forth, that I thought I would leave them alone and&#xD;
read the newspapers. I did so, and remained~ about an hour before&#xD;
I returned to the room, whqre I still found Mr Wilkins in company&#xD;
with my wife."&#xD;
'~ Ah! you jealous wretch! you !" exclaimed Kitty.&#xD;
Jonathan proceeded without paying attention to her. "He ~-&#xD;
mained a few moments after I came down and then left. I am sure&#xD;
I Was 'not wrong, mamma, in ~hav~ng left the room, but he had no&#xD;
sooner got out of the house, than she (pointing to Kitty) said I was&#xD;
ruining her, that Mr Wilkins would never call again, because I had&#xD;
insulted him by lcaviiig the room and going up stairs to road the&#xD;
newspapers, that all her old friends were one after the other desert-&#xD;
ing her, and that I was the cause of it."&#xD;
"It's ~ said Kitty, and drawing ~er chair near Mrs Oldbuok, ~&#xD;
began telling her ~vhat she said was the truth and nothing but the&#xD;
truth, that after Mr Wilkins left that afternoon, Jonathan pouted&#xD;
and became so disagreeable 'at the dinner table, that he would not&#xD;
eat linything, whereupon she reproached him with being attacked&#xD;
by the green~eyed monster, she was sure he was jealous of Mr&#xD;
Wilkins,- and that was the reason he wouldn't eat any of the fine..&#xD;
apple dumplings she had made for dinner.&#xD;
Jonat~han denied this, but Kitty persisted in saying it was true,&#xD;
when the mother intervened by observing, "My children, you should&#xD;
live in peace, I, believe Jonathan is partly wrong, and you must be-&#xD;
have better for the future," turning to her son, but at the same time&#xD;
wishing toAonciliate both parties.&#xD;
"I was going to tell you," said Kitty, "about his trampling o~i&#xD;
my dear little poodle this morning."&#xD;
"Never mi1pd, my child," said Mrs Oldbuok, "never mind, he&#xD;
will behave better for the future. Kiss and m.~ke friends, my&#xD;
children."&#xD;
- Jonathnn looked at Kitty, and Kitty at Jonathan. The latter&#xD;
w~u1d have purchased peace no matter on what terms, but the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
former was inexorable, and her very looks indicated that. she would&#xD;
not allow him to approach her.&#xD;
Mrs Oldhuck having remained a short time, and finding a rather&#xD;
more amicable feeling existing between man and wife, took her&#xD;
departure, not without Jonathan expressing a wish to see her home,&#xD;
which his mother would not consent to, saying that bhe would pre-&#xD;
t'er his staying at home and making up with his wife.&#xD;
The feud may have been healed for the moment, and a truce&#xD;
effected, but it could not have been of long duration, for there was&#xD;
evidently no congeniality between the tastes or feelings, and what&#xD;
was far worse, between the tempers of Jonathan and Kitty. The&#xD;
latter bore weapons about her person, in the shape of long pointed&#xD;
n~ils on her fingers, which kept him in dread of her, and he was&#xD;
~cry cautious how he gave her offence.&#xD;
At length the storm burst out with renewed fury, the quarrel&#xD;
arose from a trifling incident, but as ~great events proceed from&#xD;
slight causes, it was attended this time by the most serious con.&#xD;
- sequences.&#xD;
Jonathan found fault with Kitty because there was no meat on&#xD;
the snpper-table, he-ordered the servant to bring ~om~ from the&#xD;
cupboard, Kitty said she should not do so, as- there was enough to&#xD;
-eat on the table. Jonathan said sire should, but ~Wy's orders&#xD;
were paramount with the servant maid, so Jonathan went dowa*&#xD;
himself to the cupboard to get the meat, and on' coming up&#xD;
stairs, his foot slipped, and the dish was broken to pieces.&#xD;
Kitty raved like a maniac, when she found her best stone china&#xD;
dish broken to atoms, she called her husband the vilest names she&#xD;
could tnink of, and he stood gaping at the mischief he had done,&#xD;
and thinking how utterly un~.bie he was to repair it. As Kitty&#xD;
entered the room with a piece of the broken dish in her hand, she&#xD;
found Jonathan standing at the door, and she gave hltn such a blow&#xD;
on his cheek, that he cried out "murder." To prevent any further&#xD;
mischief he caught hold of one of Kitty's hands, when she began to&#xD;
scratch his face with, the other, and both being soon released and&#xD;
in full play, she flew at him like a tigress, whilst he was holloa-&#xD;
ing out "murder" at the top of his voice.&#xD;
The police burst into the house, and found Jonathan in, a. sad&#xD;
plight, his face was dreadfully bruised, and the blood streaming&#xD;
down it; he had not yet ceased to get over his fright, for he really&#xD;
believed the -woman intended to murder him. Mr ~, one of&#xD;
our .mQst worthy and efficient police officers, finding it was nothing&#xD;
but a quarrel between man and wife, and having considerable ex-&#xD;
perience in such matters, suggested the best remedy against a repe-&#xD;
tition of such scenes, by a separation for the night, if not for ever!&#xD;
"For ever," cried Jonathan, "in God's name; I cannot live with&#xD;
the woman, and I ~hall apply for a divorce to-morrow ;" saying this,&#xD;
-he accompanied the officer as far as hi~ mother's residence. On the&#xD;

placed, and a separation a mettse et thoro (from&#xD;
~as sued for, and pronounced in due course of law&#xD;
&#xD;
"Procrastination 'is the thief of time," as Jonathan Oldbuok&#xD;
thought, when he was courting Louisa Switzer, Syporah Olernents,&#xD;
atid Clarissa Shrewsbury, but of ePthe truth of the other' adage,&#xD;
f' Marry in 'haste and repent at leisure," he was nearly having a&#xD;
rull !conviction in his amours with Alksrg'uerite Gerbots, and cer~&#xD;
tainly 'received striking' proofs in the case of Kitty Spic~r.&#xD;
"Make no more haste than speed," is the safest rule to go by,&#xD;
for if Jonathan had shown less anxiety to contract marriage in the&#xD;
earlier period 'of his life, and taken more time to win the affections&#xD;
the ladies he loved, he might not have been obliged to marry a&#xD;
shrew in his old age. He was too importunate in his amours, and&#xD;
to 'that cause may be attributed the little success he met with in&#xD;
his relations with the fair sex.&#xD;
"Weijlth does not always confer happiness," is the other moral&#xD;
that can be drawn from a perusal of tb, preceding' pagos, and&#xD;
whilst virtue may take up its abode in the lowly dwellings of the&#xD;
~poor, it is not always found in the palaces oI the rich.&#xD;
